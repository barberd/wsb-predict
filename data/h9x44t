{"id": "h9x44t", "title": "Hockey in 40 degree heat: Potential catalyst for MGM", "selftext": "Gonna keep this relatively short because this isn't exactly ground-breaking shit. \n\nThe NHL is announcing its two hub cities for the playoffs on June 22nd. It looks like Vegas will almost certainly be one of the cities selected. Once of the articles below talks about how MGM is keeping some hotel spaces open for NHL teams. The NHL also signed a partnership with MGM on gambling in 2018 so the company already has a relationship with the league. Of course the NHL playing in Vegas won't bring fans-a-flocking as games will be played in an empty arena, oh by the way MGM also owns the NHL arena in Vegas. Honestly, I'm too lazy and stupid to figure out how all of this will lead to revenue for MGM, but it definitely will. Idiot millionaire hockey players from Saskatchewan playing blackjack, the arena stuff, extra gambling hype cause games are in Vegas, etc. \n\nAs I hope everyone has realized by now, fundamentals don't mean shit in this market anyways. It's the news dropping and surrounding hype that should lead to a pump, a pump that I expect to be especially big given that MGM is basically a Robinhood/WSB meme stock now. So, announcement is next Tuesday, I'm looking at buying July dated calls on any and all pullbacks this week. \n\nMGM 25C 07/17\n\nMGM 23C 06/26 for the true autists\n\nTL:DR \u2014 Vegas will be an NHL playoffs hub city (announcement next Tues.). MGM stands to benefit.\n\n[https://www.reviewjournal.com/entertainment/entertainment-columns/kats/nhl-hub-city-picks-to-come-june-22-mgm-preparing-for-las-vegas-selection-2052030/](https://www.reviewjournal.com/entertainment/entertainment-columns/kats/nhl-hub-city-picks-to-come-june-22-mgm-preparing-for-las-vegas-selection-2052030/)\n\n[https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/vegas-nhl-hub-city-announcement-expected-june-22/](https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/vegas-nhl-hub-city-announcement-expected-june-22/)\n\n[https://www.nhl.com/news/nhl-mgm-resorts-sports-betting-partnership/c-301392322](https://www.nhl.com/news/nhl-mgm-resorts-sports-betting-partnership/c-301392322)", "created_utc": 1592283930.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h9x44t/hockey_in_40_degree_heat_potential_catalyst_for/", "is_self": true}
