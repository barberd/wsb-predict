Based on a conference call happening the same day as Amazon earnings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCall happened and the stock tanked right as it started. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nStock is now halted for the day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe people over on their stock twits are losing their minds. It's crazy to watch. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI lost a few hundred but got out before the halt.", "created_utc": 1588260856.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gaxw0q/greatest_pump_and_dump_ever_just_took_place/", "is_self": true}
