Market has been going down, I think I'm a genius. \n\nVIX spikes above 50 on Friday, so I get the bright idea to sell covered calls. I'm thinking no fucking way the market tanks this fast. So I sell 38 contracts expiring June with a $35 strike price and get $4 of premium. The market would have to tank another 15% for those to be ITM. \n\nBut here's the thing, I'm concerned that even if the market tanks, and IV stays high, am I actually going to be down tomorrow. Will the calls increase in value faster than my position?\n\nWhat happens then, imagine the market tanks 15% and I don't have the cash to buy back the calls, do I just have to wait until June for them to be exercised or expire?\n\nEDIT: Some of you that are posting about my imminent death are mistaken. SPXU is a triple leveraged bear ETF that will increase tomorrow and move in tandem with the call liability. Furthermore, these are covered calls, I hold the underlying security.\n\nEDIT: I'm a fucking dummy for thinking this group would know what a covered call is...", "created_utc": 1583723634.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffob7h/help_get_me_out_of_a_position_or_half_of_it/", "is_self": true}
