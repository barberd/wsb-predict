This manifests itself in data usage. ZM will foot the bill for all of the free loaders.\n\nhttps://www.whistleout.com.au/Broadband/Guides/How-much-data-does-Zoom-use\n\nAlthough there was a partnership announced with Oracle, it seems AWS has been helping with the majority of the server demand, while ZM pays a premium for uptime.\n\nSo who is causing the data use to spike? Premium corporate users? I'd say only partially. The majority of the new users are casual users and schools. Id suggest reading this good analysis here (skip $WORK stuff):\n\nAkrams Razor - \"Zoom out, Slack In\" article on seeking alpha. Can't post link due to restrictions. But Google it.\n\nZM has stated that +90,000 schools are using the software which they provide for free with no cost, and no 40 minute limit (again large free user data consumption). That means there was 35 - 56ml FREE users per day from those sources. And as we know Zoom reported 300ml daily meeting participants instead of individual users.\n\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21242421/zoom-300-million-users-incorrect-meeting-participants-statement\n\nSo as an individual user, if you were in x5 meetings in one day you account for x5 \"participations\". If you have a few classes a day as a student, it is likely that 30 - 50% of zooms daily uses was from schools who don't pay a cent.\n\nZoom has been extremely reluctant to release and clarifying data to show the number of paying customers they have. \n\nOf the remaining userbase, distinguishing how many free casual use vs paid use is difficulty. I'd wager that the vast majority are free users.\n\nAgain, is increase in premium users enough to offset:\n\n1) incredible surge in free users hogging bandwidth\n2) pay from the +$100M acquisition of Keybase\n3) increase in payroll from ZM announcing they are going to hire 300-500 US based engineers (which most likely them trying to erase the China image they have)\n4) higher allocation of profits to R&D\n\n\nMy prediction is that the cost of revenue metric is going to increase dramatically from last quarter.\nhttps://last10k.com/sec-filings/zm\n\nI think the revenue and EPS beat slightly, but overall is a disappoinment.
