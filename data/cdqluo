Was going to post sooner but was busy over the weekend/today, it actually worked out because I was able to get more info about the storm impact on oil in the gulf region. \n\nThe pullback in oil is being attributed to the China economic data that was released today.\nIndustrial output and retail data beat expectations, but overall figures showed the country\u2019s slowest quarterly economic growth in decade. The main argument about China's slowing economic growth is that it will impact oil demand, however, China\u2019s oil consumption rose to 13.07 million b/d in June,  which is up 8% up from a year earlier. So overall I dont think Chinas demand for oil is being greatly affected (at least currently). I see today as a good dip buying opportunity, which leads me to my next point, Barry\n\nSo on the surface, one would expect oil prices to go up whenever we have a storm/hurricane impact in the gulf region, however, there is more than just production platforms that are affected during these storms. You also need to consider how it affects refineries in the area and the storms potential impact on refinery utilization rates. The higher the utilization rate, the more crude oil is converted into gas/distillates resulting in lower inventory levels. Many refineries in the Lousiana area consume anywhere from 100-550k barrels a day, that means that even if only a handful of these refineries were down, it could easily negate/cancel out production lost in the gulf (where only 17% of US oil comes from). Additionally, we need to consider how this affects export and imports coming into this region. Ultimately alot times you see an uptick in exports from oil companies rushing to get shipments out before storms and a decrease in imports from crude shipment delays So with that being said, let's look at some numbers.\n\nThe US Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement  stated up to 73% of oil production or between 1.1 - 1.4 million b/d, has been impacted as of last Thursday, with 4% starting back up today.\n\nExxonMobil's Baton Rouge refinery, which processes 502K b/d, was completely unaffected by the storm and was operating normally as of Sunday evening. Their storage terminal in Sorennto, LA was also spared and still running, meaning oil exports here were likely minimally affected as well.\n\nPhillips 66 closed its Alliance refinery Friday, which processes 290k b/d, and started operations back up today. \n\nPBF Energy's Chalmette refinery cut back (some not all) production as well, but largely due to a result of new crude deliveries being halted. I suspect more refiners delayed crude shipments as well and we'll likely see lower import numbers as a reflection of that in this weeks EIA report.\n\nTo simplify, Barry seemed to impact production and imports more than refinery utilization and exports and will likely lead to a draw in this weeks oil report.\n\nOil has overhead resistance on the monthly and weekly around $62-62.5x ( translates to roughly $12.8x USO), I dont see us breaking through this week but will be the target if EIA reports another draw. USO FD Calls either tomorrow or Wednesday before the report \n\nI will be updating this thread as info becomes available such as the API and EIA numbers\n\nGood luck \ud83d\udee2\ud83d\udc02\ud83d\udcc8", "created_utc": 1563241288, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cdqluo/uso_dd_for_week_of_71519_71919/", "is_self": true}
