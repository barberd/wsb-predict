{"id": "g1sm54", "title": "$PTON calls - do it now", "selftext": "I was stupid enough to buy PTON puts at the bottom and learned my lesson about Beckys. After doing some rough DD, like searching twitter for peleton and seeing hoards of ppl lusting for a peleton bike, seeing their pricing (mfers have installment plans with 0% APR), seeing they have a subscription model that can generate revenue while gyms are closed, and just realizing that their competition is closed opens a window of opportunity for them to convert ppl to just use their bike/treadmill/yoga class or whatever the fuck they want to exercise at a premium. Shit's undervalued and could explode at their next earning call sometime mid-May.\n\ntldr: PTON 7/17 40c", "created_utc": 1586959770.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1sm54/pton_calls_do_it_now/", "is_self": true}
