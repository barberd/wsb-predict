American investors are paying dearly for the optimism that drove the S&amp;P 500 at the start of the year.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;While big declines often follow big run-ups, this reversal -- coming after weeks of euphoric buying -- has been almost historically violent. In the 33 trading sessions ending last Wednesday, the S&amp;P 500 fell on successive days only once. Now it\u2019s had four straight down sessions, the first time since at least 1927 that the index fell so fast in the days after hitting a record.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The speed with which sentiment went from one extreme to the other can be seen in how pervasive losses have been.  \n&gt;  \n&gt; The number of NYSE-traded stocks that retreated in the past two days has been the highest of the almost 11-year bull market.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The drubbing is affirmation for skeptics who spent January and February ridiculing investors for their complacency. Conspiracy theories abounded over the first seven weeks of 2020. Disbelieving veterans attributed the market\u2019s buoyancy to everything from passive inflows to Federal Reserve repo operations to U.S. deficit spending -- the list was endless.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Now the warnings are bearing out. Take this graph of the Nasdaq 100\u2019s 14-day relative strength index, a gauge of the magnitude and persistence of price movements. It\u2019s seeing its worst four-day stretch on record -- worse, even, than during the bursting of the dot-com bubble.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Investors rushed to sell stocks in afternoon trading, with orders briefly hitting the highest since the liquidity-driven sell-off in May 2010, also known as the flash crash. At around 2:30 p.m. New York time, almost 1,800 more stocks traded on a downtick than those trading on an uptick on the New York Stock Exchange.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A fourth day of hair-trigger selling has sent the S&amp;P 500 below its 100-day moving average line, a key level of support closely watched by chart jockeys. The index had already this week broken below its average price for the past 50 days, leaving the 200-day line as the next potential break, as far as technical analysts are concerned. Should the S&amp;P fall an additional 2.7%, it would breach that level as well.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cThose tech lines should matter -- it tells you the psychology is changing,\u201d said Mark McCormick, global head of FX strategy at TD Securities. \u201cWhen markets are not trading on growth or fundamentals, a turn in sentiment nearly always leads to a drawdown in the things that are overbought and trading at a premium.\u201d\n\nSource:  [https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/too-much-bullishness-has-left-sellers-control-stock-market](https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/too-much-bullishness-has-left-sellers-control-stock-market)", "created_utc": 1582674182, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9jowb/the_sp_500_had_four_straight_down_sessions_the/", "is_self": true}
