{"id": "gs5t7l", "title": "Peloton is the Apple of fitness. Whether you agree or not, you cannot deny that next quarter will be another opportunity to double your day trade account off PTON calls.", "selftext": "I, like many, was able to make a nice profit off PTON in little less than a month and I\u2019m not done yet. Peloton is a generational opportunity that is on its way to becoming a lifelong brand like Amazon or Apple. Peloton is selling a premium product with huge margins on both hardware and SAAS to the point that the only company that compares is Apple. \n\nOftentimes people on this sub will say \u201cBut PTON isn\u2019t even profitable!\u201d \n\nThis company is set up to be extremely profitable - the only reason they are not, is because they spend almost half a billion on ads per year (more on that below). PTON is a technology SAAS product with the most profitable hardware business you\u2019ve ever seen. Peloton bikes have nearly 50% profit margin and their subscriptions will soon be 70 percent profit. Again, the only other company that gets away with charging this premium is named after a half-eaten fruit. \n\nAnother complaint heard on this sub is that this is a heavily competitive market and there are cheaper alternatives than Peloton.\n\nTo which I recommend you research how aggressively they defend their IP. Most recently, they settled with Flywheel out of court, resulting in Flywheel\u2019s bikes to be \u201cbricked\u201d \u2013 Peloton gave free refurbished PTON bikes in exchange for customers\u2019 Fly Wheel bikes, which no longer provided digital content. Flywheel is now nearing bankruptcy as PTON peddled into another litigation with Nordic Track, to further defend its patented technology. When competition threatens PTON, history shows that Peloton ends up on top.\n\nPeloton also has a very defensible moat which I\u2019ll cite Amit Rawal\u2019s article to convey (I\u2019ll post link to his article at bottom). Below are five reasons why competitors will have trouble penetrating this space:\n\n1. Vertically integrated platform - Like Apple, Tesla, and now Netflix, Peloton is vertically integrated. This means it controls the entire value chain of the business including Hardware, Original Content, and Proprietary Software (including UI/UX). This allows PTON to have a much greater control of its supply chain versus its customers and produce products at a lower cost.\n\n2. Brand Sex-Appeal, Social Quotient and Customer Loyalty - Peloton\u2019s aspirational positioning makes it the iPhone of at-home fitness. The elegant design, high touch brand experience with 96 luxurious global showrooms, and elevated experience through various digital and physical touchpoints, makes it an extremely attractive product offering. As a result, it has a cult-like following, and power-users act like brand evangelists. As per Peloton, 43% of first-time buyers heard about the brand through WOM. I can vouch for this personally since a friend who uses Peloton was so passionate that she converted me into a buyer while doing research on this story. Voila! New customer, zero CAC.\n\n3. The element of social engagement \u2014 we ride together, compete with each other, facetime while riding to push each other, give high-fives, and earn awards, makes this an immersive and socially rich experience, all from the comfort of your home.\n\n4. Recurring revenue bundle of HW and SW (Rundle) \\[Translation: higher switching costs for consumers\\]\n\n5. Efficient Scale and Cost Advantage - Given the number of paid users are now close to 1M, and likely to double over the next 12\u201324 months, Peloton will have a cost advantage that will be hard to match. Especially, when it comes to content production cost, which will get amortized across users, and continues to decline at a unit level as the base of consumers grows. Think Netflix vs. a new streaming service, the economies of scale that Netflix have are extremely hard to match for any new streaming service.\n\nWhether you believe in Peloton or think it\u2019s an overvalued POS, we all can agree that the next quarter will be even more stellar than the most-recent earnings, reported on May 6. Before I make my case, let\u2019s discuss PTON\u2019s latest earnings report. I\u2019ve listened to hundreds of earnings calls and I\u2019ve never heard a call go as smooth as Peloton\u2019s last. \n\nWhy was it so good?\n\n\\#1: Peloton expects to turn a profit this year, 2020. This is huge news as PTON previously did not expect to turn a profit until 2023. The fact that they will show a profit three years sooner than expected should be reason enough to quit reading and buy calls. Seriously, when have you heard a company turn a profit three years earlier than anticipated?  \n\n\\#2: I correctly predicted that PTON paused cancellable advertising in most of its major markets starting in mid-March as demand for the bike outstrips manufacturing. Continued growth and engagement despite a pullback in media spend signals that Peloton's years of brand-building and word-of-mouth referrals are paying off.\n\n\\#3: Average net monthly churn, which Peloton uses to measure retention of connected fitness subscribers, hit 0.46%, its lowest level in four years.\n\n\\#4: 2020 Revenue guidance was lifted from $1.54 billion to 1.74 billion (and still, PTON is sandbagging this revised guidance \u2013 more on that later)\n\n\\#5: Not only are they the Apple of fitness, but PTON\u2019s CEO showed similarities to Steve Jobs on this last call \u2013 after giving the most impressive earnings call I\u2019ve ever heard, PTON CEO John Foley demonstrated that rarely seen but immediately distinguishable confidence mark that only a few have shown \u2013 his voice carried a weight equal to that of his company\u2019s numbers. He was bold and certain that  PTON is here to stay and further revolutionize the fitness industry. It was refreshing to hear an unscripted CEO like Elon or Jobs \u2013 you can tell this Harvard grad has unmatched passion and belief in his company. We all know the impact a CEO can have on stock performance. \n\n\\#6: average monthly workouts per subscriber coming in at 17.7 -- up from 13.9 in the year-ago quarter. Additionally, Peloton said it has logged 44.2 million connected subscriber workouts, up from 18 million this time last year. \n\n\\#7: New products including a cheaper version of the bike and tread that may be introduced as early as this year.\n\nThat\u2019s all I care to type in regards to the call, but for further evidence I recommend listening to their earnings report for yourself. \n\nSo why will the numbers be better on the next earnings report due in August? Because PTON DOES NOT COUNT REVENUE UNTIL THE BIKE IS DELIVERED TO THE CUSTOMER\u2019S HOUSE. If there\u2019s anything to take away from this DD, it\u2019s this. Let\u2019s breakdown why this is so important:\n\nLate February: Americans start to pay attention to Covid-19\n\nMarch 16: Gyms close in my state (Michigan) and virtually across the nation, simultaneously google searches for peloton nearly triple. \n\nPeloton\u2019s lead time on bikes is around 6-10 weeks.\n\nThis means that ONLY A FRACTION of the covid-19 orders were captured in the last earnings report. Given lead time is 6-to-10 weeks, if people ordered PTON bikes as soon as their gym closed (March 16), then there is a very slim chance the bike was delivered to the customer\u2019s house in less than 2 weeks. The next earnings report will show the true impact of Covid.\n\nEarlier I said that PTON sandbagged their revised guidance of 1.74 billion and I will explain why.\n\nFor the first three quarters of PTON\u2019s fiscal year, revenue sits at 1.22 billion. This means PTON only needs 520 million dollars next quarter to meet its revised annual guidance of 1.74 billion. This was a SAND BAG estimate because PTON only has to have the same revenue as last quarter. We know this will be a piece of cake because again last quarter only captured a small fraction of the covid demand, lead time for new orders is already pushed out to August in some parts of the country. Everything Peloton manufactures this year will be sold. This is holiday-like demand without the holiday-like discounts and a massive pause in ad spending.\n\nBy now you probably agree that next quarter, Q4, will be impressive - but you may assume the quarter after next we\u2019ll see a dip in revenue. However, I\u2019ll argue that the revenue from the PTON tread will be Peloton\u2019s saving grace. The treadmill was cancelled in mid-march which has caused pent-up demand for the product. Additionally, peloton will be sitting on a large inventory of these treadmills, so we will not  see the same supply issue as we have with the PTON bike. Not to mention the tread is twice as expensive as the bike which will further boost PTON\u2019s already skyrocketing revenue. If you got on the Facebook Peloton page, you\u2019ll see the PTON cult is eager to expand their peloton gym by adding the tread. \n\nI suggest readers go to the Official Peloton Facebook Page and spend an hour reading comments. The deeper you look at an individual, customer-to-customer level, you will realize that there is something special with this product. This FB page has almost 300k members and everyone raves about their product in a cult-like manner. These members share very personal information and goals with each other thanks to the social and trusting community the Peloton brand has built.\n\nThe Peloton instructors also add to the engagement factor in this socially fit community. They have reached celebrity-like status in a culture obsessed with celebrities. Except riders get to see these celebrities everyday live, and may get personal shout out from their idol instructor. This might not be a big deal to people on this sub, but think how geeked a Karen or Becky would be if a Kardashian gave them a shout out, live. \n\nA lot of people think Peloton is a cult. Why? Because it is. Why else do you think I spent over 100 hours researching PTON in the past month, and spent an additional 4 hours on this post? Why else do you think users try to casually fit Peloton into their everyday conversations in hopes to recruit a new cult-member? In fact, it was reported last quarter that 43% OF USERS PURCHASED THEIR PTON VIA WORD OF MOUTH \u2013 the least expensive and most effective form of advertising. Peloton often jokes that its best salespeople are its customers. I can vouch for this as I\u2019ve already convinced 3 of my friends to join the cult \u2013 this word of mouth advertising is spreading faster than Covid. And every time Peloton gets a new member, it\u2019s salesforce grows. \n\nIf you missed out on Netflix or Amazon, don\u2019t miss out on PTON. \n\nPTON 50C 10/16.\n\nTLDR:\n\nPTON is not a covid story. They had the best earnings report I\u2019ve ever heard and their next will be even greater. They will yet again smash guidance, as only a fraction of the covid orders were reflected on this last earnings report (PTON doesn\u2019t count the revenue until it is delivered to the customer\u2019s house). PTON will sell every bike they make for the remainder of 2020 and will reintroduce the treadmill which is in high inventory to meet pent-up demand. PTON has a very defensible moat and threatens any company that steals its IP. PTON will reach profitability this year, three years sooner than anticipated. 43 percent of buyers last quarter bought via word of mouth, emphasizing the power of this cult and their loyalty to the product. PTON is set up to be one of the most profitable companies thanks to its vertically integrated platform and reoccurring subscription model.\n\nWord of advice: buy calls with expiration dates into at least October to ensure next earnings report is included. It will be stellar. Enjoy.", "created_utc": 1590670738.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gs5t7l/peloton_is_the_apple_of_fitness_whether_you_agree/", "is_self": true}
