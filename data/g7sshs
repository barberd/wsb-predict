{"id": "g7sshs", "title": "Twitter:", "selftext": "Thesis:\nTWTR is totally and utterly fucked. Twitter will have its ad revenue hit with an axe because they are currently the worst positioned of any major social media company and ad spending is getting cut across America. They have benefitted from being around longer, but they are now getting their lunch eaten by the new kids on the block - SNAP / PINS - and a recession is just going to pour fuel on that fire\n\nOutline of DD\nI) ARPU by social media platform and implication\nII) Comparison of platforms\nIII) Valuation \nIV) The pubes growing on Jack Dorsey\u2019s face\n\nI) ARPU\nSocial media companies make all of their money from shoving advertisements in front of eyeballs. The amount they make is expressed in average revenue per user (ARPU). Below are the rough rates each company generates in the US\nFB: $150\nTWTR: $50\nSNAP: $15\nPINS: $10\n\nWhy this matters?\nFacebook is the gold standard and has the best ad targeting (because they know everything about you and listen to your microphone) so they can charge the most. Adver\n\nYou\u2019ll notice the huge difference between TWTR and SNAP/PINS - this exists because twitter has been around longer and built more and deeper relationships with advertisers. Not because it generates better returns for advertisers or shows more ads than SNAP/PINS. So now, in a world where advertisers actually have to pay attention to how they are spending their now limited budgets, they are going to see that TWTR is overpriced compared to the other forms of social out there. So this leaves them in the most vulnerable position to lose ad dollars.\n\nII) Comparison of Platforms (from Advertiser PoV)\nFB: they know more about you than you know about yourself. They are always going to be the top dog and Zuck will be lizard king for life\n\nTWTR: OK targeting, but not close to FB. They also can\u2019t really push more ads because the feed is already like 30% ads at this point\n\nSNAP: OK targeting (but improving). They have a LOT of still unsold ad inventory. They also have the best positioned platform for targeting Gen Z / Millenials\n\nPINS: Phenomenal as platform. Upper middle class white women fucking get off on building lists of shit they want to buy on Pinterest. Still very young and will steal dollars from TWTR / SNAP over time \n\nPoint being - Twitter might have been around longer, but the platform is just average. They have nothing special to offer like FB, and now they have two better platforms offering advertisers a significantly cheaper way to reach eyeballs. They might have been ok when the economy was thriving, but now that they will face scrutiny they are going to get fucked\n\nIII) Valuation\nMarket cap is $22bn. Revenue is $3bn and not really growing much anymore. You don\u2019t get a 6x revenue multiple for a mature business that isn\u2019t growing double digits percent annually\n\nThis was priced in a bit, but stock has rallied back and popped when SNAP reported better than expected numbers (all social media rallied on SNAP earnings). But what we learned above is that TWTR is not snapchat. \n\nIV) Jack Dorsey is a little bitch \n\nTL;DR - Twitter fucked\n\nPosition - buying a variety of short dated Puts next week as earnings are a week from Monday. Expecting disappointment as results won\u2019t be as strong as SNAP. Also buying some longer dated 2021 deeper OTM PUTS", "created_utc": 1587818052.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7sshs/twitter/", "is_self": true}
