Buy PRPL calls.   New higher strikes are now available.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can't post links or pictures, so this will be brief.   Check my post history for the last three posts I made on PRPL if you want full DD.   I'm going to write this for those following the stock who have read those.  I did have a diagram made for all of this too...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Underwriter Exercise of Secondary Offering Option\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/sthucovdis251.png?width=791&format=png&auto=webp&s=421f6eddc136c24ce93d6502134b9a046b0bf9bd](https://preview.redd.it/sthucovdis251.png?width=791&format=png&auto=webp&s=421f6eddc136c24ce93d6502134b9a046b0bf9bd)\n\nOn Monday, Purple \"announced that the underwriters of its previously announced underwritten secondary public offering have exercised in full their option to purchase an additional 1,618,405 shares of its Class A common stock\".\n\nThis was fully expected as the Underwriters got the option to buy 1.6M shares at only $10.50 as a result of running the book on the secondary offering.   Remember, that this offering was just founders selling shares, so it was non-dilutionary, as is this exercise.\n\nThe underwriters are in the business of making transactions occur, not determining whether to invest in the company itself, so my hypothesis on the trading behavior today and unexpected volume (blue arrow on chart) is that the underwriters are just cashing in their shares they got.\n\n***This artificially depresses the price, but creates a great buying opportunity today/tomorrow.***   Volume was just over a million shares today, which is much higher than the last week or so of volume by far.\n\nIf you go look at a 6-month chart, you will notice that 12/17/2019 (first red arrow on chart) was the very beginning of a nice run up (green arrow) after the last secondary offering for PRPL . This was also the date of the last exercise notice and the last time the downward pressure was relieved on the stock that comes from a secondary offering.\n\nMonday, with the announcement of the exercise (second red arrow on chart), today with the cashing in of shares, and likely tomorrow with remaining shares being exited also ***represents the end of significant downward pressure on the stock during the secondary offering period.\u200b***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm going to reiterate my $19 price target by 8/12 earnings and that the stock should be trading at $20-$24 right now. ***Today and tomorrow represent a great entry point if you are looking for one.*** I'm expecting the run up of 1-4% per day to continue until we reach the price range mentioned earlier.\u200b\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy apologies for being a day late on this call out, but life has been busy.\n\nI'm long 521,400 PRPLW warrants, 301 shares of PRPL, 30x 15c 6/19 and 10x 15c 10/16. Do you own due diligence and this isn't investment advice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:  I snuck my chart in.  =)", "created_utc": 1591230863.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gw6irb/looking_for_an_entry_for_prpl_its_right_now/", "is_self": true}
