Poor people)", "selftext": "https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/05/27/sofi-ceo-anthony-noto-40percent-of-trading-on-platform-is-through-fractional-shares.html\n\nSo Sofi apparently has an investment platform that started within the last year. Looks like those pop-up more than hotcakes these days, and they are noticing major increases in New account openings.\n\nOne thing I've notice is that millenials are falling for the old fractional share scam that will make you as much money as holding two shares of McDonald's will after 2 years. That is ZERO.\n\nLet this be a lesson, if you can't afford stocks Yolo on options. You can't by two shares of msft and aple, so now your going to get 1/10th a share of Apple, msft, up, and fb??\n\nWhat's that after gains 50 cent? That guy hasnt been relevant for years.\n\nIm also going to assume that Samsung Money is going to be the \"debit card\" for Sofis robinhood-esque \"money management\" account.\n\nYou know Samsung, that company zero Sofi users can afford. Or even have the option of buying as it's not approved.\n\nHeck, Sofi doesn't even have options trading what is this treachery???", "created_utc": 1590673194.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gs6ghk/sofi_ceo_says_investor_accounts_doubled_and_40_of/", "is_self": true}
