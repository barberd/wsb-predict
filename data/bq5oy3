{"id": "bq5oy3", "title": "Beyond Meat - Financials and their expanding future (Food for thought)", "selftext": "Beyond Meat (BYND) kicked their IPO off at 4.2B with 9.6m shares priced at $46. Shares have soared %162 percent since release, ending at $87.66 05/17/2019.\n\nCurrently, some 70 percent of the company\u2019s revenues are generated by its flagship Beyond Burger patties. The company also sells imitation sausages and vegan ground beef. In 2018, some $50 million of Beyond Meat\u2019s revenues came from retail sales, including at Amazon.com Inc\u2019s Whole Foods Market and Kroger Co supermarkets, while some $37 million was generated at restaurants.\n\nBeyond Meat plans to expand to Europe and Asia in 2020. Currently, in Europe, meatless patties and sausage isn't a hype right now. I imagine sales and distribution to Europe would take a hit since adoption isn't as aggressive as the US.   \nNestle has already taken a stance in Europe, Germany, Netherlands, and Switzerland with its meat-free burger under Garden Gourmet. Nestle has its products in over 1,500 facilities, including McDonald's, which has monopolized the fast food industry.   \n\n\nBeyond Meat faces a ton of competition with Nestle in the lead of the market. It is operating in a highly competitive environment. The company is competing with other plant-based protein makers, including Boca Foods, Field Roast Grain Meat Co., Gardein, Impossible Foods, Lightlife, Morningstar Farms, and Tofurky. But it also views traditional meat companies as rivals, including such giants as Cargill, Hormel Foods Corp., JBS, Tyson Foods Inc. and WH Group , the owner of Smithfield.  \n\n\nWith companies that Beyond Meat is in connection with, there are no written contracts. Meaning that their products can end or change at any time, affecting sales drastically.   \nPeople have to realize, too, that they've been promoting their product with discounts (as any business would to expand) with $3 discount on a $6.29 burger. Pricing on this product at Target, Whole Foods, etc is $7.29 for 2 patties, while a standard 4 patty set is accessible for $4-5 at a Walmart.   \nDemand is a strong factor, and with this product, I believe the hype will slow down. They've made a good entrance into this industry, but a 5.2b market cap and shares priced at $87.66, I believe this is overpriced and a short-term high. 5% of Americans are vegetarians in the US. That alone creates a huge impact on Beyond Meat. Demand and a \"secret ingredient\" has to be there for a company to succeed. And in this case, demand is low and an \"Oh wow! This is really good!\" isn't there.  \n\n\nI'm a skeptic on this company. What do you think?  \n\n\n[https://quotes.wsj.com/BYND/financials/annual/income-statement](https://quotes.wsj.com/BYND/financials/annual/income-statement)  \n[https://www.bizjournals.com/bizwomen/news/latest-news/2019/01/nestl-carls-jr-add-plant-based-patties-to-burger.html?page=all](https://www.bizjournals.com/bizwomen/news/latest-news/2019/01/nestl-carls-jr-add-plant-based-patties-to-burger.html?page=all)  \n[https://www.foodingredientsfirst.com/news/beyond-meat-eyes-european-foodservice-entry-as-ipo-rumors-intensify.html](https://www.foodingredientsfirst.com/news/beyond-meat-eyes-european-foodservice-entry-as-ipo-rumors-intensify.html)", "created_utc": 1558196148, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bq5oy3/beyond_meat_financials_and_their_expanding_future/", "is_self": true}
