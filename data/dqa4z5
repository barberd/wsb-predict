{"id": "dqa4z5", "title": "Blizzcon 2019 Announcements so far (and needless rambling)", "selftext": "Since I don't see a thread by anyone else here it is.\nBlizzard announced Overwatch 2, a new wow expansion, diablo iv and a new Hearthstone gamemode (who cares about that one).\n\nNow let's look at what the after market has to say about this. That's right, completely flat so far.\n\nSeeing as ATVI already has some big boy releases in the mobile market with King and the new CoD mobile, we just have to wait and see how profitable they are gunna be.\n\nQ3 results are expected to be on Nov 7th. This year we have seen WoW classic and uhhhh, that's basically it. Seeing as MW just got released that won't be in Q3 results either.\n\nOverall I'm gunna guess that Q3 won't be anything special but that guidance will be raised with the new incoming releases. Since they've sucked off China recently Diablo immortals probably won't run into any problems on release in China.\n\nIf you came here actually looking for something useful, sorry about that.
