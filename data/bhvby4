{"id": "bhvby4", "title": "My top picks for this week", "selftext": "I'm wathcing a few stocks this week based on my idea of pre earning runup. All my picks are going to be based on not playing earnings instead, the run up prior to it.\n\n1: $SHOP I believe that shopify will do a run up based on its last earnings report where it traded from 160 to 175 in a little over a week. I firmly believe that a similar, if not a better up run up will happen prior to this weeks earnings over around 7-9 dollars a share.\n\n2: $AMT: AMT's averaged a 10 dollar move the 3 days prior to its last few earnings and I believe its gonna move at least 5 to 6 dollars prior to earnings. \n\n3: $MA moved an average of 8 dollars in the week prior to its last 3 earnings. I think it's going to out perform this and move 9 dollars and continue to move upward after earnings.\n\nI'm no way responsible if I'm wrong.
