{"id": "eh69md", "title": "My PoFo few weeks out", "selftext": "I want to share this. Maybe get good feedback.\n\nMacro:\n\nFed pumping into the repo... Zoltan(not in the fucking movie, retards) has a point, but I think its bullish for the market sp index in short term because the dollar will be cheaper and foreign exposure and physical gold, unfortunately the ETF is audited by a bunch of crooks ($HSBC ?), so do your own DoublingDown.\n\nStonks, which is why I am here:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUNIT:\n\nBackground:\n\nWindstream is a shitty internet provider somewhere in bumfuck east coast. Fucking hillbillies can't get Xfinity, but neither the State nor County won't let them fail cause its da law. Anyway Windstream gets smart and over leveraged, gets their dick slapped by spinning off a physical assets REIT which is UNITI. UNITI's only income (basically) is Windstream (who got dick-slapped). So, Windstream be like \"we broke, bitch!' UNITI be like pay us! Law says UNITI is right and the guy that slapped the Windstream around like a ho says they be right too. Judge(not Judy) in December says get \"yo shit togetha', Windstream!\"\n\nTarget : April, above $9, under $16\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAIMT:\n\nBackground: \n\nThis is a BioTech company with the only viable peanut allergy drug in near future. If you check the stats your mind will be blown. I really think on this one stock is better than options. Initial reception maybe cautious, but shit will skyrocket when it catches on in the market. Pipeline for eggs is in the works. Balance sheet is clean.... at least for a Bio-tech.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGold:\n\nGLD, or any leveraged derivative at least in short term, I don't really trust these when shit really hits the fan see Macro. Personally, I buy physical. I also store engine blocks in my front yard, they provide an excellent cover during a shootout with the government when they come for my riches.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNotable mentions:\n\nFIT: Share holder meeting is on Jan 3rd, its basically unanimous. 6 months out max to government approval, 20% return. It would be a large loss in fees to back out for Alphabet. Use Kelly or some other random stat to justify allocation on this one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n.... and of course: BBY\n\n/deleted/", "created_utc": 1577628390, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eh69md/my_pofo_few_weeks_out/", "is_self": true}
