I believe analysts are very retarded and they're missing very basic stuff, focusing on shenanigans. Here are my thoughts. This is a serious DD for once, but I'm sure if I posted it on r/investing, I would get immediately downvoted to the ground (they are such retards, Jesus). \n\nPart of my DD is very subjective, but I feel subjectivity plays an important part. If you are always perfectly objective, then you agree with the market's current price and everything is justified, and you're never going to make any money.\n\n**I'll start with the fundamentals, then technicals.**\n\n**Fundamentals:**\n\n**-Right now, Tesla is the only company I can imagine being a 20-bagger.** There are others of course, but I can't identify them. I have a high risk tolerance and have told myself for two years that if Tesla dipped I would go all in. So I'm very happy about the current drop, especially since the dip is not really justified (just a bunch of analysts snowballing into lowering their PTs)\n\n**-Industry isn't destiny.** First of all, worst case scenario Tesla is a profitable auto company, worth $50B. But keep in mind people didn't believe in Apple, because they were selling hardware. Which isn't the whole story: iOs, Mac Os, etc. are 50% of the product. A mac without Mac Os is essentially a well-designed PC. I'm not even going to mention how valuable iOs is. Just because you buy the hardware (a mac, an iPhone...) doesn't mean you don't buy the OS: it's included in the price. Which is different than PCs for which you buy the hardware + windows.\n\nPeople don't get that Tesla is the same: the software is 50% of the product. Actually, even more, since you can literally control, tweak, improve, fix everything through software. And I'm not even talking about autopilot: for example, teslas can now detect issues and immediately order parts themselves to be delivered to the local repair center.\n\nThere's more: Teslas can now also detect issues in the making, while the car still works, and have a checking appointment scheduled in order to check the issue, BEFORE the car breaks down. Can you imagine how much people would pay to have a car that never unexpectedly breaks down?\n\nAnd that's just one example of things you can do with software.\n\n**-Design:** the design is so superior. Yeah some people don't like it, just like Apple's design and design choices. They still make a shitton of money. Tesla's design is just next level.\n\n**-Data:** not even going to expand on the value of the data collected by cars and all the purposes it could serve.\n\n**-I find that in the past, everything I've been obsessed with has turned into incredibly profitable businesses.** I found myself obsessed with Tesla since the model 3. I have no idea why. But this was even before I started looking at the stock.\n\n**-Brand value and advertising:** unbelievable how good the brand is. How everyone knows it with zero advertising. I'm a high school teacher in france, in the middle of NOWHERE, and the other day I saw a student wearing a tesla hoodie. It's the cool thing now. The next generation will be the Tesla generation.\n\n**-On a personal level, I really don't care much for cars.** I thought all I needed is AC and cruise control basically. I try to invest all my money and a car is just an expense. I bought mine for 7,000 euro, great car. Great design, looks decent. Reliable, low fuel usage (74 MPG). I couldn't be happier with it, and yet I know I will buy a model 3 at some point. I will hate myself for spending that much and I would never have considered, in my life, spending over 10,000 euro for a car. Yeah.\n\n**-Oil keeps rising, and ICE cars are going to be banned.** In Strasbourg, in France where I'm from, diesel will be banned from the city as soon as 2024. Electric is the future, better for quality of driving and quality of life. Which means that of course, there will still be ICE cars for some time, and the shift will be gradual and never 100%, but the room for growth in this market is enormous.\n\n**-The demand issues are a joke.** Here in France, I have yet to see a single model 3. I don't know if demand will be an issue in the future, but for now there is still huge room for expansion.\n\n**-The bankruptcy concerns are also a joke.** I would be much more concerned if we were in a deep recession.\n\n**-The financials are bad,** but first, they have had profitable quarters. Moreover, I believe the dilution will be worth it over the long term. So yeah right now it doesn't seem shareholder-friendly but the value creation is so intense that it will still be positive. I will add that I was extremely skeptical on Tesla for years. I then realized the potential.\n\n**-Obviously, a DCF approach doesn't work.** I've tried. So indeed, there is a part of belief in this, and it is indeed a risky play, there's no denying it. But just look at the growth and rising revenue, coupled with all the positive things I mentioned. Add to that the relatively low bankruptcy probability. There is a considerable chance it will work out.\n\n**-To expand on my previous point, for cases like these, sometimes the story is more important than the current financials.** I know it sounds like bubble talk but consider this: the market has no idea how to value Tesla, and that's normal because no one has an idea how to properly value it, because it's impossible. If you focus on the story, it is obvious that what they have achieved and what they will achieve will be worth a whole lot. If you approach this like Mr. Market, then you will miss it. Let me add that my risk tolerance is high, and I'm perfectly fine losing money. In fact I would kick myself much more for missing an opportunity than staying on the side out of fear.\n\n**-Competition is a joke.** Auto manufacturers in general are not agile enough. They make cars based on the ICE model (see the Bolt for example). And, again, let's talk about software: their software is absolute crap. The user interface is, but also and more importantly what's behind it. No other manufacturer is even able to make over the air updates....\nYeah some people hate Apple and prefer Android. That's fine, Apple is still a trillion dollar company with a small market share.\n\n**-Of course, there are a million of possibilities and uses that come out of this software approach.** When they bought the original iPhone, people had no idea all the uses it could generate now. We are starting to see a couple things like sentry mode, or autopilot, or summon, but there will be many more. The software approach makes everything possible. I have a macbook pro from 2013, this thing is SO MUCH BETTER on the current Mac Os than the one it was shipped with in 2013.\n\n\nThats all I can think of from the top of my head but I'm sure there are other things. Will add them later if I think about it.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Now let's talk about the short term and technicals, and why I have been and will keep averaging down:**\n\n-I don't believe it will dip below $150, or at least not much lower. Despite the recent negativity, plenty of people are still hyped beyond belief.\n\n-The more Tesla dips, the more likely it is someone will try to buy them out, possibly aggressively. If this occurs and I haven't averaged down, I'm fucked if the buyout price is lower than my average cost. No way of recuperating the difference. Many people, especially on r/investing, laugh at the possibility of Tesla being bought out. That's retarded. Although it would indeed be a nightmare to manage the company, many giants right now don't know how to make good use of their cash and some CEOs would die for a growth opportunity like that. If Tesla dipped to $20b valuation or less, even with all the liabilities it would be very, VERY cheap especially if you could add the financial firepower of a huge company. So not extremely likely, but I wouldn't dismiss that possibility.\n\n-Frankly it just seems unrealistic for Tesla to be valued at $20B or less. Not with the current outlook at least. If there's a recession, sure, but then everything's going to shit, not just TSLA.", "created_utc": 1559384028, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bvjb9j/the_big_picture_for_tesla_what_many_people_dont/", "is_self": true}
