{"id": "hbpgge", "title": "AMC theaters reopening mid July", "selftext": "Just got an email announcing they are reopening 90% of their theaters on 7/15 and plan to open the rest by the end of July. There has been a lot of speculation about their financials and possibly bankruptcy, but the email indicates that they are strong financially and in no risk after raising $500 million in new investments. They\u2019ve been floating between $5 and $6 the last month and slowly climbing for the last 3. The 1 year high of $12 was last August in the middle of the summer blockbuster season, which is a far cry from the 5 year of $35. \n\nAs we\u2019ve seen across the country, nobody is being rational about social distancing so I\u2019m not so sure people avoid theaters once they open. With a lot of movie releases being pushed back I don\u2019t know how much steam they can pick up in the short term. Calls are pretty cheap premiums right now, but does anyone else think the stock has any life in it this summer?", "created_utc": 1592522756.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hbpgge/amc_theaters_reopening_mid_july/", "is_self": true}
