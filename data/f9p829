What are some things redditors as a whole love and/or hate?\n\nWe love our free speech and endless amounts of free tiddies (and dicks if ur a mod) and we also love to hate on fortnite.\n\nSo what does this have to do with stonks u ask? What single company holds a large portion in epic games and has invested in reddit? TCEHY. What\u2019s that? U newbies want DD? In a shitpost? I\u2019ll give u some.\n\nStonks go up. We make tendies. We use trendies to lay off the fortnite devs. Happy redditors buy coins to gild us for our hard work. We boost Reddit\u2019s revenue. We make more tendies.\n\nTL:DR Hostile takeover of Tencent to delete fornite, redditors buy coins to give us platinum, revenue boosts significantly, we retire on space yachts with Ricky Branson.", "created_utc": 1582699563, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9p829/ok_kids_i_think_i_might_be_on_to_something/", "is_self": true}
