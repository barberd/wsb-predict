Well lunar analytics is very simple. \n\nFull moon = sell\n\nNew Moon = buy\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn August 23rd, we saw a super moon, in the new moon phase. Clear bull rally that predicted what is going on currently. I will not be surprised if we hit spy 302 tomorrow. However I think as we approach the full moon, it shall be time to buy puts on S&amp;P500. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSeriously look up full moon vs New moon. It's a very good predictor.", "created_utc": 1567732256, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d09plf/lunar_ta_inside/", "is_self": true}
