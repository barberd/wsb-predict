{"id": "fkvdd4", "title": "[DD] Beth Bath & Beyond $BBBY is in deep trouble", "selftext": "Let me ask you something, what do you get when you add together: an already failing business with a target audience over 35 yo, mixed in with several weeks/months of lockdown quarantine, and sprikled with a recession.\n\nWell... you get Beth Bath & Beyond. I dont think I even know where to start.\n\nThe company has been posting terrible results in the last quarters. Showing 8% decline in Net sales consecutively. Which is crazy.\n\n[Latest 10-Q Form](https://preview.redd.it/0spash9t8hn41.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=941a7e42b4bb3a8e7937dee5ccb81feee7526917)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Previous 10-Q Form](https://preview.redd.it/cbgvlbpe9hn41.png?width=778&format=png&auto=webp&s=2af88047f0506d629065278f2aec3d5ee0075203)\n\nThis is specially bad considering they were already in a steep decline\n\nAs of 2019 third quarter, the company has posted losses for about $38M (bout 30 cents a share) Which is also pretty bad for a $1.7B company\n\nAlso, for the past year they started doing deep share buybacks. So cash situation is also bad.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tqfkq325ahn41.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=40f1cf4452cbd4dcd15c898dfe8bd71b1d30bd04\n\nThe company decided to remove the 2019 Financial guidelines (which is basically saying they're not going to meet them), and deployed a \"new strategy\" for 2020. They did this in early January before they could possible be aware of the beervirus so I'm assuming here that the plan is about to change.\n\nFinally, debt. Oh yes. There is debt. At the end of 2019, the company announced lay-offs and some store/sections closings. As for November 2019, the D/E ratio was 2. Yes, TWO. Meaning 2 thirds of the company is due as obligation in the next 6 years (moreso in 2020/2021 with leasing and shit)\n\nWhen it comes down to it, do you see them evolving in the next two quarters into profitability? If they don't do it by then, they'll need to merge.\n\nPuts are quite cheap still, so don't go too OTM because not sure how much room left this company has to fall. Could they go to 0? Maybe I'm crazy but I don't see people changing house appliances (at least the ones that do are not doing it in BBBY)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: $BBBY Puts $4.50 4/9-4/17.", "created_utc": 1584559302.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkvdd4/dd_beth_bath_beyond_bbby_is_in_deep_trouble/", "is_self": true}
