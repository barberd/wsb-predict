Their revenue is still 70% based on selling their overpriced coat hangers, oops I mean stationary bikes. Their subscription model is a looong way away from even maintaining their revenue stream, let alone leading to growth.\n\n2. Based on a price tag of $3000, I estimate they sold 50,000 of these bikes in Q3 2019 alone, and 25,000 in Q2 2019. Good news? No, because that means there's at least 75,000, and certainly way more, of these useless bikes taking up space in North America. There aren't that many households that can or want to set $3000 on fire. Bike sales are done, especially considering there was a big inventory buildup in Q3 2019. Their only hope is subscriber revenue.\n\n3. They have 1m subscribers right now. Since only 30% of their revenue comes from monthly subscription, that subscriber figure has to 3.5x for the current revenue stream to be maintained. That means 3.5m subscribers. That\u2019s going to be tough, because\u2026\n\n4. There\u2019s a fuckton of competition for the \u201cNeTFliX oF gYM eXPerieNCe\u201d market. There are even a gazillion free Youtube channels for this shit.\n\n5. Even if they achieve 3.5x subscriber growth, their gross profit on subscription revenue is hardly any better than their bike business, so they are not going to be profitable.\n\n6. No foreign growth is anticipated, because Asia and Europe live in cramped apartments with barely any space to stand, and their city planning is not actually retarded so people actually walk to places and get reasonable exercise.\n\n7. Based on anecdotal evidence up here in Snow Mexico, nobody wants this thing, and sales efforts are anemic. People most able to splurge $3000 on a bike are the people most averse to looking like a chump, which is now the brand image of PTON.", "created_utc": 1575582244, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e6o6y6/bearish_on_pton_7_reasons/", "is_self": true}
