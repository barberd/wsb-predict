{"id": "etupb5", "title": "Shorting the South African Rand", "selftext": "So as we know China  is dealing with the outbreak of the Corona virus, which although can\u2019t be good for GDP,  there material resources and economy they will be able to get through it. This may not be true however for the countries that have there economies tied to the Belt and Road initiative created through China. Most of these countries have the economies directly tied to the creation of Chinese funded public works and stimulus trade through the exportation of raw materials for consumer electronics and technology. If the Chinese economy suffers enough (as they\u2019ve already shut-down 12 economically powerful cities) they may pull these funds out of South Africa and other countries to help the cope with the epidemic. Which would untimely devalue these African and Asian countries currencies as there largest trade partner would be \u201cbleeding\u201d. I feel that there may be a large chance that shorting the Rand will result in a lot of money.", "created_utc": 1579977999, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/etupb5/shorting_the_south_african_rand/", "is_self": true}
