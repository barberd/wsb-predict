My buddy invited me to hang out with 2 strippers but their friend coupled with our extra chromosomes cockblocked us so we\u2019re hanging out alone in the parking lot with no ubers in area. There are 2 Tesla\u2019s in the parking lot of the line dancing bar in the middle of nowhere we ended up at. Now this could be a coincidence, but all of the ashtrays at the bar are also red. There are 2 ashtrays outside, and two Tesla\u2019s. Both symbols of the company. Now if we multiply these by 100 we get 400. Could it be that Elon is sending me a message that TSLA will hit 400 by 11/1? All in calls.
