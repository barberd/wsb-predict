IV is high but they are making double and triple their normal daily rates storing oil. This applies to most tankers.\n\n*Executive Decision: Nordic American Tankers\nFor his first \"Executive Decision\" segment, Cramer spoke with Herbjorn Hansson, chairman and CEO of Nordic American Tankers  (NAT) - Get Report, the oil tanker company with a 9.2% yield. \nHansson said that this is the strongest oil market he's seen in his lifetime and Nordic American is \"making a lot of money.\" He reminded viewers that Nordic American doesn't speculate on the price of oil, they merely transport it where it needs to go. But with so much volatility in the oil market and historically low crude prices, many oil companies are using tankers to store oil until they can get better prices. \nHansson said that Nordic American's fleet is being rented by all of the biggest oil companies for rates of $70,000 per day. That's helped them pay down debt and dramatically improve their balance sheet. Hansson expected to be debt-free in the near future.*\n\nDHT $9c 10/16\nTNK $22.5c 6/19", "created_utc": 1587774343.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7jzfx/nat_ceo_making_a_lot_of_money/", "is_self": true}
