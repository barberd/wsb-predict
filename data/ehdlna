I figured i'd do some quick DD/financials on Bed Bath and Beyond. See below for the bullet points.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, BBBY has had a 51% return in the last year. However, it's 5yr chart is horrendous, and are we really shocked? Let's get serious: BBBY is becoming more and more irrelevant to consumers, particularly when you can go to $WMT, $TGT, Ikea, $AMZN etc, etc to do whatever you need to furnish your own dumpster fire.\n\nIt should also not come as a surprise then, that the short interest on the stock is up about 64% in the last 12m, with the \"day's to cover\" period also increasing.\n\nIn terms of financials, it may *seem like* a mixed bag.\n\nRevenue is slightly down while the COGS is unchanged/up 0.2%, making gross profit margin drop 8%. When you include the increase in OpEx/SG&amp;A, operating income has dropped an impressive 44% in the last year - $761m down to $423m. EBITDA has a similar outcome, down 29% in the last year, and thus EPS dropping 133% ($3.04/sh to -$1.02/sh).\n\nThe income statement figures seem to paint a grim picture.\n\nCash flow figures seem to paint a different picture. Operating cash flow is up 7%, primarily  from large increases in changes in working capital (-$124m to $283m), +$100m in \"other working capital\". Interesting to note that their operating cash flow increase was dampened by their $104m in deferred taxes payable.\n\nIn terms of investment activities, there was $50m less in investments in PPE, but an additional $440m purchase of investments, alongside the sale/maturity of $539m in investments. Note, this is NOT purchasing/issuing stock of BBBY. \n\nFinancing activities are interesting. Dividend payments have been increasing, but the 2019 financials show almost half the amount of common stock was repurchased. As a result of increased operating cash flow, less capital expenditure, free cash flow increased a solid 22%.\n\nNote that these figures are the 2/8/2019 and 2/28/2018 figures as comparison, NOT the TTM. the TTM figures are especially grim, particularly for net income. Inventory quadruples. the TTM free cash flow is less than half of the 2/28/2019 figure ($593m vs TTM of $266m)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat are your thoughts here? I feel the thesis for a short position is justified in the financials and outlook of the company; never mind its continued irrelevance. However, what concerns me is that if I were to go short, and they post a better than pessimistic earnings, there may be a decent short squeeze. Analysts see a continued slide, but if it doesn't, may be a sizable pop.\n\nUltimately, i would probably short shares few days prior, then sell a $14 put as a 'covered put' position in the weekly to get assigned at a nice profit.\n\nBBBY:\n\n \\- 1yr return: +51%\n\n \\- 5yr return: -78%\n\n \\- Short Interest up 64% to 58.8M shares short over 12m\n\n \\- 1yr revenue change: -3%\n\n \\- 1yr EPS change: -133% ($3.04 to -$1.02)\n\n \\- 1yr CoGS change: +0.2%\n\n \\- 1yr Gross Profit change: -8%\n\n \\- 1yr Operating income change: -44% ($761m to $423m)\n\n \\- 1yr EBITDA change: -29%\n\n \\- 1yr Net Income change: -132% \n\n \\- 1yr Operating Cash flow change: +7%\n\n \\- 1yr Investing activity change: -24% (note: 2019 had $539m in sale of investments to affect this; purchases of investments increased nearly 2.5x)\n\n \\- 1yr Free cash flow change: 22%", "created_utc": 1577662900, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ehdlna/some_bbby_dd_before_20200108_amc_earnings/", "is_self": true}
