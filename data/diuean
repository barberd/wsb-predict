The most actively traded contract is the October 18th 50.00 call as volume is 3,003 versus open interest of 450, so we know that this primarily represents new positioning. The activity on this contract mostly consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought at various prices, including a 1,347 block that was bought for $0.90 when the bid/ask spread was $0.60 x $1.25, which suggests bullish intent.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAlso seeing some heavy call activity (\\~7:1 over puts) is **Morgan Stanley Inc.

Volume on this contract is 29,854 (vs. open interest of 203) which mostly consisted of a two 13.43K blocks that were bought (around the same time) at the ask price of $0.25.

(COTY - $0.02 to $10.36)** which is primarily being driven by activity on the November 15th 11.00 put. Volume on this contract is 5,077 (vs. open interest of 4,389), which mostly consisted of a 4,607 block that was bought for $1.09 when the bid/ask spread was $1.04 x $1.10. We know this block is a new position given the open interest figure and we can assume the intent is bearish in nature since the trade took place above the midpoint of the bid/ask spread. Note: COTY is scheduled to report fiscal Q1 earnings on November 6th before the market open.\n\n**Baker Hughes Co. (BHGE - $0.03 to $22.27):** Puts are outpacing calls roughly 80:1 which is predominately due to a couple of large blocks that traded on the November 19.00 put (volume is 4,605 vs. open interest of 40) \u2013 a 1,720 block was bought at the ask price of $0.15 and (around the same time a 2,580 block traded for $0.10, directly in the middle of the $0.05 x $0.15 bid/ask spread.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**Volume Signals** \n\n**Floor &amp; D\u00e9cor Holdings Inc.
