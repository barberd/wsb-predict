{"id": "fd2eko", "title": "UPDATE: Yesterday I said I lost -400% a day. That's because Robinhood is fucking retarded and has an open position of short 200 shares of $SPY while I have no money for that and can't even see the position.", "selftext": "I made this post yesterday: https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fcn4dj/i_lost_400_in_one_day_without_any_open_positions/\n\nHere's how my account looks today: https://imgur.com/a/7j1bsM4\n\nI was trying to figure out what the fuck happened. How it was fucking down all day since 9:30 AM EST on top of them being retarded as usual did not help out. I had 2 different put spreads go ITM on Friday 2/28.\n\n8 spreads of SPY $310p/$309p and also 4 spreads of $298p/$297p. \n\nRobinhood assigned me to buy 800 shares of SPY at $310 for a total of $248,000 and then shorted 800 shares at $309 for a total of $247,194.43. \n\nPerfect. That's how Credit Spreads are supposed to work, they are defined risk and your max loss is your collateral, when both legs are ITM they are supposed to be exercised and assigned against each other to cancel out.\n\nNow my 2/28 $298p/$297p spread is where they fucked up. \nAs you can see here in these two screenshots: https://imgur.com/a/ytgMp7O\n\nI had FOUR PUT SPREADS. For some fucking reason they let 2 $298p contracts expire worthless and voided the assignment of buying 400 SPY shares which would've been a totla of $119,200 as you can see.\n\nInstead, they fucking exercised the $297 put and SHORTED 400 shares of $SPY at $297 for a total of $118,797.32 and then fucking assigned the $298 put for me to buy ONLY 200 shares of SPY for a total of $59,600.\n\nThis makes absolutely no fucking sense. I don't know why they allowed me to fucking buy 200 shares while shorting 400 shares. \n\nI now have an open fucking position of -200 shares of SPY at $297 I guess and I can't see it anywhere in my positions or nothing to do anything about it.\n\nI emailed them multiple times and explained what they did wrong and told them the math of it and  when I finally got a response it was some fucking automated bot shit telling me I should either \"sell shares, exercise, or deposit money\" to \"stop the deficit\" and told me to visit the help center for information. There shouldn't be a fucking deficit in the first place if they paired up the right amount of shares.\n\n$SPY cratered itself at the end of the day and I got some of my money back, instead of -$2570 or whatever it's -$1 now as you can see in the first screenshot, this proves that I do indeed have an open unmatched short position and they are retarded.\n\nI keep emailing them and even DM'ed them but still no responses. I am clearly not responsible for any losses or any supposed \"margin call\" because they don't know how to do their fucking job.\n\nAll of this shit should've cleared Monday anyways. \n\nI guess now even if I lose a lot of money I could sue them and bring this evidence to court because the math is very correct and their mistake is blatant. \n\nFuck you Robinhood, fucking scam of a company running out of a wooden shed in Mongolia.\n\nEdit: **Just called FINRA and explained the situation. They said I can make a complaint and when I asked about the time it'd take they said they've been getting too many complaints about Robinhood. They said any investigation will now take a minimum of around 3 months with all these complaints. Guy on the phone also sounded very very depressed I assume from all the bullshit going on and all the people calling. He gave me the Robinhood number 650-940-2700 and I told him I already called them and it said to email them. He just sighed and didn't even have any words to say**\n\nEdit 2: \n#Too long didn't fucking read Robinhood bought 200 SPY shares and shorted 400 SPY shares which means I have a naked short for -200 shares until they fucking close it. I could owe an infinite amount of money if SPY goes to like $320\n\n#You've got to be fucking kidding me https://imgur.com/a/zjpljKU\n\n#FUCK YOU ROBINHOOD! FUCK YOU CITADEL!
