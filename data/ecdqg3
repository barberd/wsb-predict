{"id": "ecdqg3", "title": "New Unlimited Leverage Glitch Using the Federal Reserve", "selftext": "Okay guys, tread lightly because they may patch this one. Apparently there's this thing called \"repo\" where you can get margin from the Federal Reserve or a G-SIB like JPMorgan. Basically you just need to have treasuries as collateral and the dealer will offer you margin anywhere from overnight to one month at a really low interest rate in exchange for offering up your treasury bonds temporarily.\n\nHere's what you do: use your treasuries to get margin from the Fed, then turn around and immediately buy even more treasuries. This glitches out the system, which now thinks that you have even more collateral! You can use this to keep taking out even more leverage, and buying even more treasuries, until you are leveraged to your personal risk tolerance. Some people will say this could make you run afoul of Basel III regs and capital constraints, but they don't know what they're talking about. Now you have $30 billion in investable capital that you can YOLO into SPY $420c's or whatever. All you have to do is make enough to pay off the \\~1.5% interest and you're in the clear - if not, just delete your account.\n\nThe best part is that as long as you assume that the Fed will eventually restart full-on QE, you can accumulate as many treasury coupons as you want with zero risk - you're just front-running them and eventually they'll buy them back from you for big gainz! The only real risk you run is if you accumulate enough capital that you become a G-SIB, the party's over and you have to become a commercial bank.\n\n**tl;dr: literally cannot go tits up - suck it Robinhood risk management**", "created_utc": 1576681351, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ecdqg3/new_unlimited_leverage_glitch_using_the_federal/", "is_self": true}
