{"id": "c7g6zs", "title": "What does Dish network want with $40B of 5G spectrum?", "selftext": "Dish has been struggling for awhile now with declining TV subscribers and an abysmal streaming platform that has only 2.4 million subscribers.  Meanwhile, over the last 11 years, the company has been slowly accruing a treasure trove of expensive wireless spectrum that it isn't using.\n\nAccording to the company's [May 03 10-Q filing](https://dish.gcs-web.com/static-files/f03c25b6-0f91-4d9d-bc4c-f60ae0d1bcd6), the company has spent $11B over the last decade acquiring wireless spectrum licenses, and a further $10B in licenses bought through \"non-controlling investments\".\n\nDue to the US government's push to roll out 5G, the FCC has imposed build-out requirements on spectrum distributed in the 700MHz band.  Spectrum is broken up into chunks which are auctioned to wireless companies under the expectation that these companies invest the money required to actually build out a network in this bandwidth.\n\nIn 2012, after two small satellite phone companies went bankrupt, Dish purchased their assets.  These assets included a chunk of spectrum that the US Government had given the companies for free in an effort to grow the satellite phone market.  DISH lobbied the government to expand this spectrum to allow for terrestrial use, under the agreement that it would begin rolling out its own network as a competitor to the major telecommunications providers.\n\nIn 2015, a DISH subsidiary made a $10B \"non-controlling\" investment in Northstar Spectrum and SNR Wireless.  Both companies bid at an FCC auction for AWS-3 spectrum and received a $3B (25%) discount due to their size, with the obligation that both companies meet the build-out requirements.  After the FCC uncovered that these companies were tied to DISH, the companies had $3B of spectrum (equivalent to their discount) revoked and DISH was forced to pay a $515M fine.  DISH is actively [appealing this decision](https://www.fiercewireless.com/iot/dish-works-to-rescue-3-3b-spectrum-discount-aws-3-licenses) back at the FCC to try and prove that it never controlled these entities in an attempt to try and win back their revoked spectrum.\n\nThe FCC granted DISH all of these licenses to use spectrum with the expectation that DISH build out massive mobile broadband. So far, DISH has come up short on these build-out requirements, leading to speculation that is sitting on these bands, hoping to resell it when 5G bandwidth gets hot.  Due to its failure to meet recent critical deadlines, its 700E and AWS-4 bandwidth deadlines were moved forward by one year, requiring 70% coverage in their respective areas by March 7, 2020.  Its 10MHz build-out deadline was moved up to April of 2022.\n\nIn response, the company says it plans to spend $1B to build out a 5G network \"focused on supporting narrowband Internet of Things\", of which the first phase is anticipated to be completed in March 2020.  However, they initially promised that this spectrum would be used for mobile broadband. DISH claims they plan to upgrade the network to support broadband another 2 years later in 2022, or 13 years after they first started buying this bandwidth.  A failure to meet these deadlines will result in the revocation of licenses, depending on the extent at which the network was built.  If DISH only builds out 10% of the network, the FCC may revoke its license in the other 90%.\n\nDISH currently holds $\\~40B of spectrum assets, with $15B of debt and $2B of cash with which to build out a network and meet the FCC's requirements.  [It has more mid-band spectrum than Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint](https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/25-charts-spectrum-ownership-united-states) \\-- second only to AT&amp;T -- with no network to use it.  Analysts are hugely skeptical of DISH's ability to build out the infrastructure in time to meet the deadline.  There is also a growing concern that the spectrum assets aren't worth as much as Ergen was betting.\n\nAlong comes Sprint and T-Mobile.\n\nThe recent merger proposal of Sprint and T-Mobile draws a lot of concern over antitrust issues.  In an effort to appease the Justice Department, the two companies have agreed to sell a portion of their shared assets, including Sprint's own Boost Mobile and some spectrum.  The top bidder so far to the tune of $6 Billion: [DISH Network](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-18/dish-is-said-to-near-6-billion-deal-for-t-mobile-sprint-assets).  The Justice Department is looking on this purchase favorably, as it sees DISH as the best opportunity for a 4th carrier in the US, simply due to the huge amount of unused spectrum it's squatting on. Publicly, DISH hopes to finally put its spectrum to use through Sprint and T-Mobile's own network via Boost, effectively using the $6B to buy him more time to build out a network -- or squat on it some more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Super biased further reading](https://makespectrumgreatagain.com/#_ftn15)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have no position in Dish, but I think this is an interesting story to follow.", "created_utc": 1561910783, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c7g6zs/what_does_dish_network_want_with_40b_of_5g/", "is_self": true}
