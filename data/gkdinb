Following this logic\n\n1. SRNE announced this cure two days ago.  Since then no expert has stepped forward and validated the results\n2. Trump  would have embraced this fully if there was significant information  validating their cocktail.  Cure found Go Merica,  Economy saved....  Here's a blank check to SRNE\n3. The cocktail may indeed be effective; however, there may be significant impediments in a massive distribution.\n\nHere's some additional research aligning to another GILD look we've got a cure play.\n\n1. The antibody, one of \"hundreds\"   it screened, blocks the coronavirus' spike proteins from attaching to    ACE2, a receptor on the surface of healthy cells that serves as a    \"doorknob\" to open the cell to infection.\n2. The   company is partnering with NY-based Mount Sinai to develop an   antibody  cocktail, Covi-Shield, comprised of three different  antibodies,   including STI-1499, for prophylactic use. It says it can  produce up to   200K doses per month and is looking to produce \"tens of  millions\" to   meet demand.\n3. Reuters reported on the Mt Sinai partnership 8 days ago. [https://www.reuters.com/companies/SRNE.A](https://www.reuters.com/companies/SRNE.A)\n4. SNRE's feedback on the results [https://investors.sorrentotherapeutics.com/node/11241/pdf](https://investors.sorrentotherapeutics.com/node/11241/pdf)\n5. No peer reviews have been provided... doesn't disqualify the results... just so many questions.\n\nIf the antibody is so effective by itself, then why do you need three different Antibodies?\n\nWhere is the scientific paper showing full recovery on patients within four days?\n\nFor that matter where are the patients you cured?\n\nToo many questions coming up.\n\nAnd  FOX NEWS is pumping it...   Might as well buy calls while we have the  next GILD run.   Can't wait for Trump to push this one on the market.", "created_utc": 1589563843.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gkdinb/srne_sorrento_therapeutics_the_next_gild_pump_and/", "is_self": true}
