Today ER were bad BUT they rocketed anyway +4%. The TA astrologists think it is going to the moon even though DB are collapsing...\n\nI hedged the bet buying some call options and now my position is that I'm short 3500 stocks (about 28k Euro). I could cover something with some calls I have bought, but then I'd lose all the options value.\n\nWould it be a good idea writing sell options around my break even price (way out the money)? If the price goes up no one will execute them (some profit). If price goes down they will execute  so I cover my position.\n\nThinking now, I could do this much better, but then it'd be less entertaining.
