That doesn't happen,\u201d Powell said. \n\nPowell added that while the most direct relief for U.S. households and businesses will come from a $2-trillion stimulus bill passed by the Senate early Thursday, \u201cthe Federal Reserve is working hard to support you now and our policies will be very important when the recovery does come to make that recovery as strong as possible.\u201d\n\nPowell's comments come hours after the Senate approved a massive economic rescue package early Thursday morning after weeks of bipartisan negotiations and several last-minute threats.\n\nThe bill includes provisions for direct payments to Americans making less than $100,000 each, forgivable loans for small businesses intended to prevent layoffs and bankruptcies, aid for industries devastated by the outbreak, and more than $400 billion to backstop Fed lending facilities opened over the past month to stabilize financial markets.\n\nThe Fed since March 3 has slashed its baseline interest rate range to 0 to 0.25 percent, begun purchasing more than $700 billion in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, and established programs where financial firms can receive loans in exchange for corporate bonds, commercial debt, and short-term municipal bonds.", "created_utc": 1585225216.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpakap/powell_federal_reserve_will_not_run_out_of/", "is_self": true}
