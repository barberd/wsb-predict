{"id": "doecpn", "title": "Consensus", "selftext": "Have you ever stumbled upon a crypto reddit around jan-18, post crash? It felt like suddenly stumbling upon a religion. And the belief on that sub was that Bitcoin will still make everyone millionaires. Big posts explaining in smart words why this will happen were all the rage. I'm sure you know other subreddits where consensus and defending the consensus seems like the sole purpose of it, even when everything around is disproving it. Like /r/wallstreetbets in Q4-18, when every dip was supposed to be the last, and red days were not even scary because all of that was supposed to be over soon.\n\nOut of those two subreddits, only /r/wallstreeetbets made some damage. That's because you don't realise you're part of the cult when you're part of this kind of cult. To improve my decisions, I found it important to step back a bit, and start probing rather than participating. Biggest money makers on this sub are ones who can recognise when they, themselves start to get a bit too excited about the next obvious market move. And the feeling of being one of the few who can call it with such confidence. It's so TEMPTING to be the guy who called the top at 3040 before the fed, loaded up on puts and got 500% gains. That's when STEP BACK light should be blinking.\n\nThe good news for bulls is that /r/wsb is still plenty bearish. Yes we've done a lot over last three sessions 2980 to 3040. But people just can't help themselves, just look at the daily thread. Yes there might be a bit of a correction pre-fed. But overall I'd say even calls bought at the highs today are safe. (I'm excluding hardcore FDs which are fucking delicious crystal meth of the financial markets - but if you do that, and you don't assume straight away that this money is lost, you have no respect for your own intelligence). \n\nFed is gonna cut by the way, but it doesn't matter because that's what market expects anyway. No-cut is a dumb motherfucking scenario that you'd have to be a total imbecile to even entertain. \n\nAs long as things are good with China, we rally.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR - buy calls, 2 weeks out, 50% now, 50% after fed. Or just 4 weeks out and forget the fed.", "created_utc": 1572292852, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/doecpn/consensus/", "is_self": true}
