Have you met your unholy incestual child from that time WSB had a bukkake with both our favorite children, TSLA and \ud83c\udf08 \ud83d\udc3b . That\u2019s right, meet your bastard son (or is it grandson?): TSLA Puts.  \n\n**The play**\n\nAny OTM strike, 5/15 Puts on TSLA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Rationale**\n\nHighly risk asymmetric bet, TSLA has a lot more downside, and very limited upside. \n\nI can see TSLA falling to pre Fall 2019 melt up levels of $350 or even lower. \n\nQ1 results will be reported late April and will be shockingly bad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Thesis**\n\n**1. Tesla business model exposed to virus shocks and oil shocks.**\n\nLet\u2019s run down Tesla\u2019s core business operations and assess how fucked they are. (F for respect)\n\na) Tesla has a giga factory in Shanghai and supply chain in China. Remember how Tesla faced manufacturing hell in a stable business environment? You really think they are going to deliver when there are actual real life supply chain disruptions? F\n\nb) Tesla sells luxury cars. What kind of normie is buying cars, never mind luxury cars in a recession? F\n\nc) Tesla sells cars to China. A quick google search shows that China has been facing an auto recession for the past 2 years, beer bat flue sure as hell isn\u2019t driving demand. F\n\nd) Oil prices low. Why buy electric when oil is cheap AF? F\n\n**2. Tesla overvalued.**\n\nWSB has proved that the collective autism of its people has the power to shape reality. \n\nLook at this normie, former GM, Ford, and Chrysler executive:\n\n**\u201cAlmost a mass psychosis\u201d: Tesla's 250% stock rally makes no sense, Bob Lutz says**\n\nSource: [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/auto-bob-lutz-nobody-explain-tesla-250-percent-stock-rally-2020-2-1028905903](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/auto-bob-lutz-nobody-explain-tesla-250-percent-stock-rally-2020-2-1028905903)\n\nLittle does he know that WSB has managed to weaponize autism. \n\nIn the past 6 months before the downturn on Feb 21, TSLA up (+266%), versus SPY up (+12%). \n\nAnd since the start of the bear market, TSLA down (-40%), versus SPY down (-23%). As of March 13, 2020.\n\nSPY has touched December 2018 levels, whereas TSLA is still at its January 2020 levels. \n\nThe takeaway is that there is a long way down for TSLA to go. \n\n**3. Options are relatively cheap**\n\nConsider a 5/15 Bank of America ATM Put has Implied Volatility of 90% and a 5/15 Tesla ATM Put has Implied Volatility of 100%. The market believes that both stocks have similar volatility. Ask yourself if that makes any sense. \n\nBe bank, be too thicc to fail, whore yourself out to Daddy P, swallow $1.5 trillion capital ejaculation. Don\u2019t forget retards, banks are the first ones in line to get bailed out by Big Brother (unless you\u2019re the Lehman Brother RIP). \n\nTSLA on the other hand is a highly cyclical car manufacturer that trades like a tech stock.\n\nClearly, TSLA should be trading at a higher IV. \n\n**4. Investor Psychology** \n\nFor the most part of the last year, TSLA was trading sideways between $200 and $300, until that one fateful fall day when it reported blowout Q3 earnings that started its meteoric ascent. \n\nThis next exercise might be hard for most of you since autists don\u2019t experience empathy but try anyways.  \n\nBe a long time TSLA shareholder who owned the stock before the senseless rally. You touched yourself at night thinking about how TSLA was breaking the previous ATH every other day. It hits 900 but you stay greedy and wait for 1,000. All of a sudden while your touching yourself, \ud83c\udf08 \ud83d\udc3b jumps out the closet and \\[this part has been censored due to graphic nature\\]. You wake up the next day and you don\u2019t remember what happened, but your bum hole is really sore. TSLA has puked 40% of its value. \n\nWhat do you do now:\n\na) BTFD, like a boomer\n\nb) Do nothing, like a vegetable \n\nc) Lock in your +100% gains, and roll it into puts, like a true autist\n\nMost TSLA shareholders are still in the money even after accounting for the 40% drop. Once they realize that this beer bat flu is the real deal and start liquidating positions, TSLA will be an easy sell since they are still up +100%. This will lead to more selling and at the end of the day the only people holding TSLA are the idiots who bought in at 800. Fucking cucks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe best time to get in on this trade was last week retards. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Appendix**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tahw5rtza1n41.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&s=74ffc11c05e3c18fa0d01561e4efe553eab3f9a0\n\nCaption: TSLA down 40% from Feb 21 to Mar 13.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w71gl5v5b1n41.png?width=765&format=png&auto=webp&s=0df353bae2913fe7c87d13d326173d4bbae45c34\n\nCaption: SPY down 23% from Feb 21 to Mar 13.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1wfcbot6b1n41.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&s=871b1d7e3602b2f366d641b4df87507d3aa4ba99\n\nCaption: SPY rally up 12% in 6 months leading up to downturn.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r0y6l8w8b1n41.png?width=779&format=png&auto=webp&s=a815ac8ea98e4897431feefe55f13717a1b8a447\n\nCaption: TSLA rally up 266% in 6 months leading up to downturn.\n\n**Positions**:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dv6prci9b1n41.png?width=1121&format=png&auto=webp&s=01a70e0f89a026d69a8d622329c8c672fe6880b5", "created_utc": 1584364453.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjkr5d/tsla_puts_a_fundamental_technical_and/", "is_self": true}
