The algebra involved is literally middle school level. There are 12 year olds that can draw out the P/L graphs of the strategies we're talking about without breaking a sweat.\n\n\"But OP, plenty of people on /r/wsb are morons, at least I'm helping them!\"\n\nNo dumbass, you're not. Because understanding the basic mathematics behind a credit spread is the easy part of trading one. The hard part is *everything else*. Ya know, picking a ticker, developing an investment thesis, risk management, knowing when to take your profits/cut your losses...all that shit?\n\nIf somebody's too stupid to go to fucking Wikipedia and learn what a credit spread is, then they're *definitely* too stupid to make any money using them. So the only thing that you might be achieving is taking idiots who should be keeping their money literally anywhere else and getting them to lose it on $TSLA 410/420C or something.\n\nPlus you post here, so you're probably stupid, so you're probably gonna [get shit wrong](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cfadpo/so_you_wanna_trade_spreads/euaarq6/) anyway. Which means the morons would probably have been better served learning this shit literally anywhere else, or, again, not learning this shit at all and keeping their money under their mattress.\n\nWanna make some content that's actually useful?\n\nHow about you explain how to read a balance sheet? Or an earnings report? Or if you're a TA freak, a chart? If you're swing trading, how do you pick a ticker? How do you determine when to exit a trade? How do you do risk management?\n\nHell, even if you're determined to YOLO 100% of your account into OTM calls on some shit weed stock, you could at least explain what factors you're on the lookout for when you make that play.\n\nI don't do that shit because I don't know how to do that shit because I don't know how the fucking market works. But at least I know I don't know that, so I'm not out here losing all my money because I just learned what a credit spread was and clicked the first stock on my watchlist to open the first one that Robinhood suggested me.", "created_utc": 1563656024, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cfqr13/hey_morons_quit_wasting_space_on_the_frontpage/", "is_self": true}
