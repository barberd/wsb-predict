All are well above the current price.  Not sure what to make of it, maybe someone with more intelligence can figure this out.\n\nThink there is still more downside as the virus spreads causing nationwide lockdowns, but the downside momentum seems to be tapering off (we aren't pinning the overnight limits anymore).
