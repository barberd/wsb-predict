FOMO call at peak, put at bottom\n2. Buy at peak IV and fuck by theta\n3. Buy OTM weeklies or FDs\n4. Blindly trusting DDs\n\nAnd I'm still holding gay JNUG position.\n\nNothing I can do except starting it over after lockdown\n\n[Position and P&L](https://imgur.com/kMYdfhz)", "created_utc": 1585281926.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpqbq2/people_that_lost_large_amout_of_net_worth_whats/", "is_self": true}
