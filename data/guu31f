However, construction has picked back up and in some states, it wasn't even shut down. \n\n-HDS has beat EPS the last 11 quarters. \n\n-My company spent over 400k at HDS the past 18 month. Why? Because their prices were good and they actually sold everything whereas other supply houses only sold mainly one main item and a few other items (lumber, waterproofing, etc). \n\n-We've all seen how Home Depot and Lowes has done so far. Their earnings got shadowed by the cost of increased PPE against Covid-19. But HDS does not have that problem. Their showroom is tiny and most of their work consists of delivery to job sites and buildings. I see very minimal increase in cost for employee PPE. \n\n-A lot of construction related stocks have shot through the roof over the last few weeks (TPR, FAST, ACM).\n\n- Buy shares if you are worried and head over the /r/investing.", "created_utc": 1591048833.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/guu31f/hdsearnings_next_week_0609_0619_35_call/", "is_self": true}
