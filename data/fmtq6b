Hopefully someone can correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nPCR aka Put-Call Ratio; this is defined from Investopia as \"an indicator ratio that provides information about relative trading volumes of an underlying security's put options to its call options. The put-call ratio has long been viewed as an indicator of investor sentiment in the markets, where a large proportion of puts to calls indicates bearish sentiment, and vice versa.\"\n\nThe strategy behind PCR is when \"above 1 is considered to be an indicator of a selloff while a put-call ratio below 1 is an opportunity to buy. Some traders use the put-call ratio as a contrarian indicator, and buy when the ratio is above 1 and sell when the ratio is below that figure.\"\n\nNow look at this fucking chart below that I made from data obtained at yahoo finance.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/yQM4l34\n\nYes that is a PCR Ratio at about 15 on May 1st. The Red line is at a constant of 1. Here is another chart with volume and open interest (in %) overlay as well.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/DuGBPvH\n\nLooking at his it seems like a massive sell off is coming in may and the PCR stays consistently above 1 from 3/27 all the way until then. Correct me if I'm wrong...\n\ntldr; SPY BIG drop incoming in May\n\nEdit: I thought the witcher was a game...", "created_utc": 1584850232.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmtq6b/spy_dd/", "is_self": true}
