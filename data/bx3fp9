{"id": "bx3fp9", "title": "ES Futures and SPY analysis - 6/5/19", "selftext": "Quite a crazy move yesterday and overnight as SPY pushed above the resistance of the bearish channel. As it stands right now, we don't have confirmation to go bullish or bearish confidently at this point as we are now consolidating from yesterday's move.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, that being said, the bearish move is possibly over thus a new target is set. At this point, the target is 2870-2983 over the next few weeks. We will need to hold 2800 support before we get a move to attempt that level.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlay smart. Take profits. \n\n  \nChart -&gt;  [https://imgur.com/gallery/Yipc8Ch](https://imgur.com/gallery/Yipc8Ch)", "created_utc": 1559746249, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bx3fp9/es_futures_and_spy_analysis_6519/", "is_self": true}
