{"id": "bpjyxy", "title": "Locking in profit when selling options?", "selftext": "Apologies if this is an obvious question.\n\n\nIf I sell a covered put for a stock, the price eventually drops, but I\u2019m on the hook until either the option is exercised or expires, if I buy the same put that I sold, I should have 100% chance of profit right?\n\n\nSo for example:\n\nI sell a put for GE, expiring January 2021. I collect $400 from the premium. Sometime between now and then, the share price rises and the same option that I sold now only costs $100. If I buy that same option and the price eventually moves back ITM, I\u2019ll essentially have some profit from the out that I bought (plus 100 shares that I\u2019m forced to buy, but I can sell those). Or if the share price finished OTM, I\u2019ve made $300 profit rather than the $400 I could have made. \n\n\nIs there more to it, or am I roughly correct?", "created_utc": 1558050495, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bpjyxy/locking_in_profit_when_selling_options/", "is_self": true}
