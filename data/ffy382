{"id": "ffy382", "title": "Carnival Cruise Lines - Bankruptcy or Bounce?", "selftext": "Alright, I think I found my next play: CCL, Carnival Cruise Lines. It's currently just a few dollars shy of it's financial crisis lows. You can sell an October $20 put for $6. If CCL is trading below $20 by October then you buy the shares at an effective cost basis of $14/share. Annual dividend right now is $2/share, though that will almost certainly get cut. Either way shares at $14 is literally 20th century prices.  \n\n\nI think that even if the next few years are bad for the cruise line industry, unless there's a fundamental change in how Americans recreate, the cruise lines should come back. Boomers are retiring and they go on cruises, there are more boomers (around the world, not just USA) than any other demographic in the world, and while they are no longer in their peak spending years, they sure as shit are in their peak cruising years.  \n\n\nHere are the 4 ways this play can go:  \n\n\n1.) CCL recovers and trades above $20 by October. You make $600. (I think this is the most likely scenario)  \n\n\n2.) CCL trades lower and is below $20 by October. You buy shares at a cost basis of $14/share.  \n\n\n2a) After you buy shares, CCL continues to drop, declares bankruptcy, and goes out of business.  \n\n\n2b) After you buy shares, CCL recovers, trades above $14/share, you make money on the dividend as well as on increasing share value.  \n\n\nTL-DR; Sell Oct 2020 $20 CCL puts for $6.", "created_utc": 1583774279.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffy382/carnival_cruise_lines_bankruptcy_or_bounce/", "is_self": true}
