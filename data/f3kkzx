Then my dumbass buys more options cuz \u201cthey\u2019re on sale\u201d and continue to lose money. Yes it\u2019s my fault, I know. I was caught up in the moment. All I\u2019m asking is for ideas on how to get back to being positive or atleast break even. DOES NOT HAVE TO BE MICROSOFT OPTIONS. After I make profit or breakeven, I\u2019m gonna sell and take a step back and reevaluate what I\u2019m doing. Tbh I think I just invested at the wrong time. Who woulda thought bezos bitch ass would cause the stock to go down.\nTL;DR Need ideas to get out of a $200 hole so I can sell and take a break", "created_utc": 1581643604, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3kkzx/im_trying_to_dig_out_of_a_200_hole/", "is_self": true}
