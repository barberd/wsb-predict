{"id": "byq16z", "title": "Back at it boys", "selftext": "So I downloaded Robinhood and played around here, played around there, met you lovely group of lads lost a good portion of what I started with. \n\nWell, finally I had enough, I said, \u201ctman, it\u2019s time to start trading for real, get rid of robinhood, pay your commissions, maybe chart out some those crazy options strategies before you buy, and grow up... maybe learn a thing or two\u201d so I cashed out of robinhood, put some money over at TD, put some money over at my home town bank Ally Invest, and I\u2019ve done fairly well, and have only made gains. I actually have a solid exit strategy on something I effectively yolo\u2019d... a good old Iron Condor on VOO. \n\nWith the extra money I have been saving that I have been giving to you guys or whoever buys/sells the options I have been working with, combined with a promotion at work (plus I\u2019m traveling now, so a huge dollar increase) I have been on a spending spree. \n\nToday I said.. you know what... I\u2019m finally doing it. I\u2019m getting the god damn Apple Watch, and you know what I find? Robinhood got a Watch app? \n\nI got a 401k I contribute the maximum to, I max my IRA out yearly. I give Ally and their investment team a couple percent and a piece of my paycheck. \n\nFuck the nonsense, fuck all this safe trading, I\u2019m going back to robinhood man, exit strategy? Who gives a fuck.. graph something? Nope.. DD? Fuck it. , let\u2019s start buying calls on robins top losers list... all from my god damn wrist.", "created_utc": 1560119393, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/byq16z/back_at_it_boys/", "is_self": true}
