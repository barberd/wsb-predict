My goal is to hold them long term and harvest premiums via Covered Call so that I can offset part of my losses if the market tanks further or even stay the same. \n\nWhat do I call as juicy? That has mainly to do with the IV of a stock. AAPL calls have more premium in them than MSFT. TSLA calls have more premiums in them than both AAPL and MSFT. \n\nI\u2019ve been doing rinse and repeat for the last one year on AAPL, ROKU, AMD and SMH via the same covered call. I can\u2019t thank my intermediate knowledge of Options enough that I know this strategy. Even with this gigantic broad market drop, my portfolio isn\u2019t down as much as those individual stocks. I\u2019m much better now as compared to a simple buy and hold portfolio that can only hope for the market to recover in another 1-2 years. If nothing else, covered call is generating me enough money from my portfolio in a month that I can buy some of the other long term stocks like UBER and add them to my wheel portfolio of stocks I don\u2019t mind owning long term. \n\nI\u2019ve been asked before what do you do with your short call when the market rallies? I roll the call out in time (as far out as it takes) for more premium and hang on to my shares. \n\nSo I wanted to ask for other stocks like these that have long term potential and are here to stay. Unfortunately it\u2019ll take long time to generate enough cash buy expensive stocks like TSLA. So I\u2019m eyeing on cheaper ones.\n\n- Today I bought 100 shares of Boeing as well and sold a weekly covered call for $700 (not arguing if the pains for BA are over, just thought it\u2019s a bargain at this price). \n- UBER is the next one in my mind. \n- SQ is another one", "created_utc": 1584497589.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkhvcb/my_experience_with_covered_call_and_looking_for/", "is_self": true}
