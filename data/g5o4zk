{"id": "g5o4zk", "title": "USO -> Gone by End of May or Ban", "selftext": "I'm tired of this... It has to stop. USO is completely broken. If I were cheating, I'd say that USO is already gone. They changed their distribution of futures contracts, and they no longer \"semi-accurately\" track spot oil prices. TastyTrade had a video in youtube which is short, explains the fund and contango, and should be mandatory watching before Robinhood lets you yolo your life savings on such a shit fund. After today, and their near capitulation, I wanted to put it out there for all the WSB community, that the time has come. USO->0. \n\n1. We have never had a situation like this. Enormous supply, demand gone + landlocked distribution = pay someone to take this shit off my hands \n2. Negative oil prices, and not in some tar sands field in Canada, present a new risk that was not properly planned for - USO will liquidate long before that, but the bottom just got moved down 40$ and that's scary. \n3. Retail investors screaming to get in. Volume is making the issues much worse. As volume of the fund has exploded over the past weeks, they have grown and grown in % of Futures contracts owned. Rolling forward their futures contracts is massive, disruptive, and expensive. \n4. The fund is dislocated from its NAV price, and that might only grow worse over the next weeks. No new shares are being issued right now, so Everytime some CNBCer wants a piece of USO, Pressure builds.\n\nIf you are thinking of buying shares of USO, get the hell out of here. If you think there will be a short squeeze in the next days or week term? Try and time it, be my guest. But this fund has been picking up steam downhill for a while, and the time has come that it's over. Do the math, buy FD puts, and watch it burn.", "created_utc": 1587504568.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5o4zk/uso_gone_by_end_of_may_or_ban/", "is_self": true}
