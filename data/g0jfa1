{"id": "g0jfa1", "title": "The Biggest Short: Eurodollars", "selftext": "Alright, listen up autists. I'm going to give you the play of a lifetime here: Eurodollar puts\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst of all, if you only have a RH account, don't bother wasting your time reading this, you can't trade eurodollars on RH. Any other serious broker should work. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Quick intro\n\nIf you don't know what Eurodollars are, look it up first, eg. the [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurodollar) page to get an ELI5. The main thing to understand is that Eurodollars have little to do with euros or exchange rates, and everything to do with INTEREST rates, specifically the 3-month USD LIBOR rate. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe futures contracts are priced on a 0-100 scale (mostly, could go over 100 with negative rates for example), with the price being 100 - LIBOR3M. So, if LIBOR is say 1%, price of the futures contract would be 100-1 = 99. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# THE PLAY: \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe current LIBOR3M rate is 1.21888% (see [this page](https://www.global-rates.com/interest-rates/libor/american-dollar/usd-libor-interest-rate-3-months.aspx) for the current rates) as of April 09. That would imply a Eurodollar settlement at 98.78112. However, the pricing on the May front-month options /GEM0 is at 99.485, which implies a rate of 0.515% for the LIBOR in May. **NOT GONNA HAPPEN!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, what you want to buy are the May 15 puts on the June 2020 futures. Unlike regular stonk options, Eurodollar FOPs come in **2500x multipliers**. The price on the May 15 99p is $0.0050, which means 1 contract will cost you $12.5 + commisions, so $1000 will buy you about 80 contracts. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# How much can you make you ask?  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, if the LIBOR3M remains flat at 1.21888%, you'll make (99 - (100 - 1.21888)) \\* 2500 \\* NUM\\_CONTRACTS. So, for $1000 = 80 contracts = $43,776\n\nIf the LIBOR moves back to last week's high, 1.45%, you'll make $90,000 per $1k. \n\nAnd if the LIBOR moves to over 2%, like I expect it to, you'll make $200,000 or more. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe beauty in this play is that it works for bulls and bears alike. If you're bearish => shit's fucked => LIBOR loans become more risky => higher LIBOR. If you're bullish & everything goes back to ATH => higher LIBOR, either through inflationary expectations or higher rate expectations. If you think everything gonna stay flat, you still make 43x.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRemember that this is not investment advice and you should do your own DD before following some retard on the internet. That said, I'm willing to answer whatever questions you guys have, just post a comment. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Buy Eurodollar (ticker /GE) May 15 / June puts at either 99 for $0.0050 or 98.875 for $0.0025.", "created_utc": 1586786232.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0jfa1/the_biggest_short_eurodollars/", "is_self": true}
