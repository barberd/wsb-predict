That is insane, but it isn't AMD's first rodeo with a bubble. In about this same time a year ago we saw AMD do the same shit. \n\nAMD's products have evolved for the better but, they are still far behind NVidia in the GPU market. And despite Intel's inability to produce a commercially viable 7mm chip, it still favorable among consumers in the aggregate. AMD's pockets are not lined to the likes of NVidia and intel and investors will start to realize that, in order for AMD to command a $40 price tag(198P/E ratio); AMD will need to transcend its earnings(well past what they're earning now), and despite its progress it's not quite there yet. AMD needs time and a fair share price to grow as a company in the long term.\n\nAs much as I want to spin the wheel with AMD, I don't see this party going on for too long.\n\nI'm open to discussion, tell me why i'm wrong.", "created_utc": 1573887333, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dx3jx5/shitty_amd_dd_40_hard_cap_then_down_to/", "is_self": true}
