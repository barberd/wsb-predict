I fact checked and went in.\n\nSo they get FDA approval, the after market on Friday goes crazy up because of it. Then Monday it shits the bed back down. I guess it was already priced in? I'm being told Nestle is likely to buy them out, and to still hold the opinion (I don' t have weak hands so this wasn't an issue). \n\nBut it's lost like 66% so far.
