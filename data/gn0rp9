They sell products that aid in drug discovery and other materials science applications by predicting how molecules, including proteins and potential drug candidates, will interact. [From their website](https://www.schrodinger.com/platform):\n\n>*Our physics-based computational platform integrates differentiated solutions for predictive modeling, data analytics, and collaboration to enable rapid\u00a0exploration of\u00a0chemical space.*  \n>  \n>*Our platform is deployed by industry leaders worldwide for drug discovery, as well as for materials science in fields as diverse as aerospace, energy, semiconductors, and\u00a0electronics displays. The platform powers our own drug discovery efforts, from target identification to hit discovery to lead optimization. It also drives our research collaborations to develop novel*[ ](https://www.schrodinger.com/node/407371)*medicines for critical public health needs.*  \n>  \n>*With more than 150 Ph.D. scientists on our team, we invest heavily in R&D. We\u2019ve published over 400 peer-reviewed papers that demonstrate the strength of our physics-based approaches, and we\u2019re continually pushing the limits of computer modeling.*\n\nAs for the drug discovery space, see this slide from their investor presentation:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xca34tmpzmz41.png?width=1938&format=png&auto=webp&s=a497606be049b11371f99274d597e5682f1c57ce\n\n**HOW DO THEY MAKE MONEY**\n\nThis isn't some abstract *one day* somebody *might* use it company. [They claim all of the top 20 pharma companies as customers](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/cro/big-pharma-partner-schrodinger-wants-a-100-million-ipo) (as of a quote from 2018), and they have many many more customers.\n\nThere are two ways that they make money. The first is the standard annual payments for licenses to use the software. The second is from their collaborative programs. Each is different, but Schrodinger can get research fees, milestone payments, or future royalties from the various agreements.\n\nCheck out these two slides from their investor presentation:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0qxyji090nz41.png?width=1938&format=png&auto=webp&s=88fab621ebec5f2742bdf83200e365dee43467d2\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ft8tkias1nz41.png?width=1892&format=png&auto=webp&s=01261a478114b9ba71b1a2631920923594b25b5c\n\nThis is awesome - SDGR gets paid for software use, they (usually) have no/minimal risk with developing these programs, yet they get milestone payouts and/or royalties as they succeed.\n\nYou can read their Q1 earnings results [here](https://ir.schrodinger.com/news-releases/news-release-details/schrodinger-reports-first-quarter-2020-financial-results-and). I want to highlight their balance sheet - they are debt free and have significant YOY growth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**DRUG DISCOVERY PROGRAM**\n\nI do want to comment on their rapidly growing R&D expenses. This is expected and has been noted by management before. As they get closer to filing INDs and initiating clinical trials for their various internally managed programs, costs will grow. They have five wholly owned drug candidates, and they plan to start IND-enabling studies for at least one of the drugs (MALT1 inhibitor) in the first half of 2021.\n\nIn the near term, their partner Morphic Therapeutics recently announced their on track for the IND for their IBD drug candidate collaboration mid-year. I suspect others are going to face similar timelines, and this could set SDGR up well to have a slew of advancing drug candidate collaborations in 2021 and 2022. Furthermore, I believe the true value of this company will become unlocked as these programs advance and potential approvals are within sight for 3, 4, 5, or more of these collaborations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**VALUE**\n\nWhen I saw that SDGR had an IPO, I was immediately excited. I used their software at a prior job, and I had my eye on this company for a while. This company has no debt, significant cash on hand, is very rapidly growing, and has a viable business model (unlike 99% of these shit buzzword tech companies that pay $3 to get $2 revenue).\n\nFull disclosure I am long SDGR with calls and stock. I have no intention of selling any time soon, but I will commit to not selling within 1 week of this post.", "created_utc": 1589933922.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gn0rp9/schrodinger_sdgr_computational_drug_discovery/", "is_self": true}
