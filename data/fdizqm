But we might not get that high which mean biting the bullet at 1.90-2.00.\n\nKeep an eye on LK as it spikes. Earnings is coming up on Mar 11th. We will go with 20th because the 11th is not announced and firm. The last earnings report was up to Sept 30th. Thus Q4 coming up will report on Oct-Dec. They will have a loss per the norm. But just imagine guidance for Q1 (Jan through Mar)! It will be a disaster. Even today stores are not back to normal. Restaurants are closed. Take out is the norm for what is open. The news around LK has been very quiet the last 2 weeks giving fomo a chance to form. SBUX said things are getting back to normal which helped the fomo.\n\nWe have a short report:  [https://twitter.com/muddywatersre/status/1223274746017722371](https://twitter.com/muddywatersre/status/1223274746017722371) Now I do not know how accurate it is but it never helps even if only bits and pieces are true. Some sketchy crap in there from many different angles.\n\nShort interest sits at 46.4% as of 2/15. Quite often short sellers do a lot more research then longs. I don't need to mention the gone death flu is still causing some chaos. Raw coffee prices are spiking and sit above $1.20 a lb. Previously they could count on sub $1 pricing quite often during 2019.\n\nThe recent rise is probably traders wanting to cause a short squeeze before the big crash coming. Naturally they swill switch to shorting it once they are done. Because who in the duck is paying 40 plus right now? \n\nI have no position at the moment but I am watching carefully for a slow rise up. I need a rise in SP price to offset some of that IV. Price target is below 35 after Mar 11th.  Looking for a 20% drop. I normally let option prices come to me to give me an edge.", "created_utc": 1583353019, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fdizqm/get_lucky_with_lks_bad_luck_due_to_the_777_444/", "is_self": true}
