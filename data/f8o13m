{"id": "f8o13m", "title": "The subprime mortgage trading that caused the Great Recession was the greatest Wall Street Bet of modern times.", "selftext": "For any of you fellow autists out of the loop, the great crash of '08 was actually caused by lenders giving out loans to anybody that could breathe to buy houses, starting in the early 2000s. Aka, subprime mortgages. But the lenders went full retard and sold the mortgages to bull gang investment banks like Lehman Brothers and CIT Group. Investors who got burned by the dot com bubble of the early 2000s needed a replacement in their portfolio and started eating that shit right up. For a good while, everybody was getting massive tendies and everybody was happy. But the feds saw all this and were like \"hol up, this is just a bubble\", and started raising interest rates on all the mortgages in the hope that it would stop this degeneracy.\n\nNaturally, the \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b homeowners couldn't make their monthly payments anymore and started defaulting on their loans. This meant that the bulls got the rug pulled out from under them and saw red, and everybody knows what happens when bulls see red. They foreclosed on the bears and kicked them out into the streets. \n\nThe banks that held the mortgages were now beginning to realize that they played themselves and had basically gave free money away to the original lenders. The lenders no longer had the money to give out more loans. By 2008, the economy was in complete freefall. The effects were felt around the entire fucking world. The stock market took a shit. Everybody started selling to limit their losses (except holders of WMT). Millions of people lost their jobs and over 10,000 suicides have been linked to the Great Recession.\n\nMillennials with student loan debt have been a prime candidate for lenders to offer non-prime loans to, sparking concerns that financial institutions have failed to learn or are ignoring the lessons from a decade ago. Classic WSB fuckery. \ud83d\udc02", "created_utc": 1582531085, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f8o13m/the_subprime_mortgage_trading_that_caused_the/", "is_self": true}
