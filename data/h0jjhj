They are the largest provider of genetic sequencing tools and solutions for genetic analysis. They are the big player in the industry (near monopoly-like) and it was announced that they have received emergency authorization use for their COVIDSeq test for COVID-19:\n\nSource: [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200609005872/en/Illumina-Receives-FDA-Emergency-Authorization-Sequencing-Based-COVID-19](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200609005872/en/Illumina-Receives-FDA-Emergency-Authorization-Sequencing-Based-COVID-19)\n\nAs the country switches from lock-down to re-opening, the need for testing will go through the roof. Illumina tends to not get too much attention from finance publications and analysts other than up/down-grades, and they have as of yet been totally left off of the typical CORONA-pharma plays list. The recovery has outpaced SPY, but not by a crazy amount and not close to some of the outperformers we have seen recently.\n\nThe fundamentals of the company are solid, the price is definitely expensive but in this crazy market does that even matter?  Cash flow and earnings steadily growing year over year, great balance sheet, and great positioning withing the industry.\n\nI have been in Illumina as a long-term hold for over a year and see no reason to sell. I will buy more on a large dip if that ever comes.\n\nEdit: Earnings are scheduled for late July, so pick expiry's around that time if playing options. It looks like Robinhood only has a 7/24 expiry or a September expiry. I would think strikes of 380 and 400.\n\nEdit: removed the retarded part about \u201cpartnering\u201d with FDA.", "created_utc": 1591821182.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h0jjhj/illumina_ilmn_next_covid19corona_play_genetic/", "is_self": true}
