Oddly, it's trading at \\~500% premium over net asset value (stonk at $131 versus $22 NAV). Graysclae has a couple other US-traded issues ($GBTC and $ETCG, that track bitcoin and eterum classic, respectively). They trade at NAV premiums too, but nowhere near the nosebleed valuation that the thinly traded, heavily manipulated $ETHE does. I've been following ETHE for awhile, and the question for discussion is, **how can this thing continue to be worth 6X cash?** I mean, the trust literally holds nothing but Ethereum; exactly 0.09404 ethereum ($239 \\* 0.09404 = $22.57) for every share of $ETHE ($131).\n\nThis is irrational exuberance on crack.", "created_utc": 1591032250.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/guoqum/this_is_truly_nuts_ethe_500_premium_over_nav/", "is_self": true}
