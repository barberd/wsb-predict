I run a company and manage several investments, but they\u2019re not tied directly to any exchange.  Always thought about day trading, but never had the right opportunity until this giant bear cave opened up.\n\nAnyways, I\u2019m looking for suggestions of stocks that use alternative functions.  I\u2019m loving TVIX and UVXY.  They\u2019re little chaos barometers and they make me gush.  \n\nDoes anyone have suggestions for toys that are based on other market statistics besides cap and IV?", "created_utc": 1585882738.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fu0ddh/suggestions_for_stocks_that_use_metrics_other/", "is_self": true}
