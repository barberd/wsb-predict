But, I forgot it takes days for \ud83c\udf08 RH to settle and let me have my money. So I go to Webull (big mistake) and set up a ACH transfer and get a \ud83c\udf08 RH style instant deposit. First of all, and this goes without saying, fuck \ud83c\udf08 RH. Second, fuck webull too. Their quotes are delayed 15 min unless you pay for some shit PLUS their instant deposit was fucked and said I don\u2019t have enough buying power to put in a position when I clearly do according to the account dashboard. \n\nThen I remember there\u2019s cash in \ud83c\udf08 RH and it\u2019s seems to be working less gay than usual....\n\nSPY 3/11 $311c bitch", "created_utc": 1583276938, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fd3dkq/ive_made_my_most_autistic_move_yet/", "is_self": true}
