{"id": "ctmef9", "title": "BBY calls", "selftext": "After I horribly messed up and lost a lot of money with home depot, I was thinking about putting puts on BBY.\n\nThen I realized that pretty much everything to do with BBY and its whole industry is up.\n\nEvery single retail store giant seems to be booming exceptionally well in their earnings.\n\nSo, BBY calls.  Just because everything seems to have done well and I cannot see how BBY would be the exception.\n\nI'll be buying them nice and early at a $75 strike.\n\nGood luck.  Technically this is DD, since the financial statements of Walmart, Home Depot, Lowes, Roku, Nvidia, DI, TGT and more did well.\n\nI figure if roku did well, it means TV sales are up significantly.  If Nvidia is up, computer sales are up.\n\nBest buy is basically a computer/TV salesman with a bunch of overpriced shit that people still buy.\n\nTLDR:  BBY CALLS @ $75 - Pick your own expiration you animal.", "created_utc": 1566418635, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ctmef9/bby_calls/", "is_self": true}
