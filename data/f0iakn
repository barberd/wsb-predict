Which is why I double downed on my bearish positions today.\n\nOk onto the real DD.\n\nEd Hyman's team has China's GDP pegged at [0% for Q1 of 2020] https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/07/chinas-gdp-growth-this-quarter-will-be-0percent-according-to-top-economist-ed-hyman.html\n\nAccording the CNBC's latest live [blog](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/07/coronavirus-latest-updates.html) Norwegian Cruise Lines and Royale Carribean have banned Chinese nationals from all of their ships and Honda has suspended all operations in Wuhan through Feb. 13th.\n\n[Shanghai is a ghost town](https://news.yahoo.com/coronavirus-puts-shanghai-coma-154246392.html) despite not being on mandatory lockdown. There's actually a great dark pun in this article that I caught:\n\n&gt; And few ***bat*** an eye any more at pausing for the ubiquitous temperature reading\n\nAnd also a PSA from a China Gov't social media:\n\n&gt; \"You cannot disinfect yourself by standing out in the sun\"\n\nSo the storm rages on and the WHO admits they know [virtually nothing](https://www.usnews.com/news/world-report/articles/2020-02-06/who-coronavirus-source-severity-still-unknown) about the virus and that there is still no known cure.\n\n&gt; WHO officials said they don't know the source of the virus and that a treatment doesn't yet exist, despite some\u00a0reports claiming otherwise. They also don't fully understand how severe it is or how it is transmitted.\n\nBut everything's fine, the Chinese Gov't has this [completely under control](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3049606/coronavirus-doctors-death-becomes-catalyst-freedom-speech)\n\n&gt; \u201cThe news of his [Li\u2019s] death will be very carefully managed and downplayed as much as possible. [Chinese President Xi Jinping] would not allow it to be used like the death of Hu Yaobang was in 1989.\u201d\n\nOh yes, we wouldn't want another Tienamin Square incident. So of course:\n\n&gt; \u201c[Xi] will double down and see the need to tighten control even further. The last thing he will allow is for him to appear weak.\u201d\n\nAnd finally the 34 year old whistle blowing doctor who tried to warn people about the virus last month as and was [reprimanded by police](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3049489/coronavirus-outpouring-grief-and-anger-after-death-whistle) is now dead.\n\nSo there you have it.
