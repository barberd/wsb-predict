{"id": "bdzfv1", "title": "Salvaging a bull put spread", "selftext": "So my bull put spread that expires this week on ATVI (sold 50 $48 puts, bought 50 $47 puts for .43 credit) went tits up. The only way I can think of salvaging this is selling the $47 puts and holding the $48 naked puts in hopes that they will be worth less before expiry. All that needs to happen is for ATVI to bounce .57 cents and I can break even, but of course if it drops 50 cents I\u2019ll be negative 2500, and -5k if it drops a dollar. My question is will robinhood allow me to hold the naked put? I\u2019ll have enough collateral cash after selling the 47 puts but as soon as it moves in the other direction slightly, I\u2019ll be at a negative balance. Any suggestions?", "created_utc": 1555449963, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bdzfv1/salvaging_a_bull_put_spread/", "is_self": true}
