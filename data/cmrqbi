{"id": "cmrqbi", "title": "My thoughts on AMD", "selftext": "Throughout the past year, I have been researching computer parts to build my own PC, and I\u2019d say around just half a year ago, PC building subreddits and people in general recommended both AMD and INTC cpus for building a PC. Each had their pros and cons. However since the release of the new line of AMD CPUs, Id say for 95% or more of PC builds, people are recommending AMD cpus. In addition, they are gaining traction in the medium/high end gpu market. Before the release of their Ryzen 5700 gpu line, their medium/high end gpus were kind of a joke and people stuck with Nvidia. Now, AMDs top gpu (5700 XT) is a competitor with the 2070 super card and AMD in the CPU AND GPU market offers same or better performance compared to Intel and Nvidia at a MUCH better price. Especially seen in the CPU market.", "created_utc": 1565103900, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cmrqbi/my_thoughts_on_amd/", "is_self": true}
