I bought a bunch of 2/21 $20 $SPCE calls at a strike of 1.15 with my papermoney account and then they exploded, and it seems SPCE just can't be stopped so I finally put some real skin in the game and bought the exact same call with real money. Immediately it plummeted 10%.\n\nI'm holding because weakhands are for pussies but I realized I don't know how this really works. Is this option going to go up in value as SPCE approaches 20 no matter what or is there some other weird shit that's affecting it, like the strike price. Besides the Greeks of course.\n\nI'm an autistic retard don't @ me", "created_utc": 1579629955, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eryge8/lurker_who_finally_jumped_in_on_spce_need/", "is_self": true}
