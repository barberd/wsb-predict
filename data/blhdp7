They admit to me on e-mail that they have had problems with linux systems. I use Arch Linux.\n\n- IBKR - this morning, before the markets opened, I placed a market buy order on TSLA using their paper trading system. The whole day went by and the market order wasn't fulfilled. This doesn't exactly give me confidence in IBKR, so I won't be opening a real account with them. Their paper trading system was also extremely buggy and error prone.\n\n- RH - It was almost impossible to place multi-leg options and even more difficult to cancel or change option orders that had already been placed. So I canceled my account with them about two months ago.\n\nAny other deep discount brokers whose systems work with Linux?", "created_utc": 1557175254, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/blhdp7/discount_brokers_whose_systems_work_with_linux/", "is_self": true}
