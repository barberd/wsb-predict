Limited Edition Steelbooks for Bumblebee literally sold out (though that released April 2).\n&gt; \n&gt; Last Q and full year was down due to supply issues in the wake of Toys R Us, which doesn't seem to be a problem anymore, but the estimates don't reflect the strength of their rebound and efforts with Amazon and Ebay in particular.\n&gt; \n&gt; Magic the Gathering has been one of their bigger growth places for years, and they've been pouring in money for that in the last few years, and by all measures it's paying off very well.\n&gt; \n&gt; Frozen 2 at year end, but this quarter's results are going to blow away expectations.\n&gt; \n&gt; If that doesn't convince you, listen to the Power Rangers remix, which should hype you up for the earnings announcement: http://rangercommand.com/news-mmpr-theme-remix-dj-white-shadow/\n&gt; \n&gt; TL;DR, my gut said so. Buy buy buy.\n&gt; \n&gt;If you listen to the conference calls, they said that Magic Arena is doing very well, even converting players into paper players (something like driving a 20% growth in paper, rather than any cannibalization of their paper playerbase), and that's one of their bigger/riskier investments in the last few years. Nerf seems to be their biggest liability, but with the unexpectedly good reception of Bumblebee and Captain Marvel, I'm expecting an earnings beat and strong guidance going forward.\n&gt; \n&gt; #If it goes to shit, buy the fucking dip because Frozen 2 is coming.\n&gt; \n&gt; One of the more looming long-term criticisms of Hasbro is that its success is somewhat dependent on the success of Disney and Marvel films. However, the influence of Frozen was absolutely absurd: something like 50% growth company-wide in their girls toys department, even though HAS was YEARS late to the party? This time, HAS is in it from the beginning, and they've been in charge of Marvel toys for the entire MCU.\n\n&gt; WotC, which is in charge of D&amp;D and Magic, has been experiencing a shitload of growth and getting a bunch of investments, including bigger marketing pushes and various video games... in part because of a company-wide \"digital first\" effort, but also in part to reduce this external dependence. Magic products have only recently started being sold on Amazon, and a number of premium products sold very well in the last quarter. In their conference calls, they said that Magic's digital side had record-breaking performance thanks to Arena (which is kind of a meaningless comparison), but store numbers are somewhat widely reported to be higher as well. I think that the success of that side will be unexpectedly high.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, Bumblebee clothes were fucking everywhere for a while.\n\nWhy did I pick those strikes? No fucking reason.
