Here are your pre-market movers & news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[Today's Top Headlines for Tuesday, April 7th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/07/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-april-7-2020.html)\n\n*****\n\n> * Dow futures were pointing to an over 700-point gain at Tuesday\u2019s open a day after President Donald Trump expressed hope about research for treatment of the coronavirus. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged more than 1,600 points, or 7.7%, to start the week as data showed signs of new U.S. cases slowing. However, it\u2019s too early to determine whether that\u2019s a trend. The S&P 500 jumped 7% on Monday. The Nasdaq rose 7.3%, bringing the index out of a bear market. But the Dow and S&P 500 remained in bear market territory \u2014 declines of at least 20% from 52-week highs. All three stock indexes hit all-time highs in February before states issued stay-at-home orders to fight the spread of the virus and the economy ground to a halt.\n\n*****\n\n> * Trump, at Monday evening\u2019s White House coronavirus briefing, said, \u201cThere\u2019s tremendous light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d The president said 10 therapeutics are in active trials and some are looking \u201cincredibly successful.\u201d Fifteen other potential treatments are \u201cadvancing rapidly\u201d toward clinical trials, he added. Trump also said, \u201cStay inside and let\u2019s win this and let\u2019s get our country [back] as soon as we can. I think it\u2019s going to be sooner than people think. Things are going really well.\u201d However, at the same briefing, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said the world may never get back to what it considered \u201cnormal\u201d before the coronavirus emerged from Wuhan, China in December.\n\n*****\n\n> * A warning in late January from White House trade advisor Peter Navarro about the potential severity of the coronavirus in America came as the president was publicly playing down the risks. According to The New York Times, Navarro wrote in memos that the outbreak could cost the U.S. trillions of dollars and put millions of Americans at risk of infection or death. Navarro is a leading hardliner in trade talks with China. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said another $1 trillion is needed, beyond the just-passed $2.2 trillion effort. The California Democrat wants another round of direct payments to Americans and more money for companies to keep making payroll. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said in recent days that health care should top the list, signaling his intent to get to work on a new bill.\n\n*****\n\n> * World leaders are rallying around U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, wishing him a speedy recovery from the coronavirus. On Monday evening, he was admitted to the intensive care unit at St. Thomas\u2019 Hospital in London after his symptoms worsened. Trump sent his best wishes, saying: \u201cAll Americans are praying for him, he\u2019s a friend of mine, he\u2019s a great gentleman and a great leader.\u201d Johnson announced on March 27 that he tested positive for the coronavirus. He was said to be suffering from \u201cmild symptoms,\u201d but he was hospitalized Sunday evening and moved to the ICU a day later. Johnson\u2019s medical team said the prime minister was conscious and not on a ventilator. Johnson had asked Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to carry on the prime minister\u2019s duties \u201cwhere necessary.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n> * Britain\u2019s over 52,000 coronavirus cases are among the top 10 nations with the most infections, according to Johns Hopkins University data. However, with 5,385 deaths, the U.K.\u2019s mortality rate was over 10%, second only to Italy\u2019s 12.5% death rate. Italy has the third most infections in the world at over 132,500 but the most deaths at 16,523. The U.S. has the most cases with more than 368,000. The death toll America rose to 10,993. New York state has the most U.S. cases, over 131,800, and the nation\u2019s most deaths, 4,758S. Global cases topped nearly 1.36 million with 75,944 deaths and over 265,500 recoveries.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](http://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/NmSSvD9.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NyybhRp.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/PWPjWxA.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/mrxih7p.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/CiSjNJD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*($SMPL $CONN $GBX $LEVI $ANGO $RPM $SGH $LNN $MSM $SJR $WDFC $NTIC $EXFO $CAAP $SLP $TLGT)*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/R9DSwjk.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*()*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\nN/A.\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/zuGtqSt.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ydPENYP.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/7hPwNQF.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/xCYyII9.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hsetB9l.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/F9VUitN.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/cMJ0wYy.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS:\n\n* AKER\n* XOM\n* SDOW\n* UGAZ\n* IMMU\n* DAL\n* T\n* CCL\n* APA\n* SPXS\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/07/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-kraft-heinz-3m-slack-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Exxon Mobil** \u2013 Exxon Mobil said it was cutting 2020 capital expenditures by 30% and cash operating expenses by 15%, with the moves designed to put it in the strongest possible position when the energy markets improve.\n\n> #**STOCK SYMBOL:** XOM\n\n> * [CLICK HERE FOR CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=XOM&ty=c&ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&p=d&s=l)\n\n> ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LIVE STOCK QUOTE!](http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/XOM)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Slack Technologies** \u2013 The workplace messaging service increased the size of its planned convertible debt offering to $750 million from its originally planned $600 million.
