Picked up one put for BYND with strike of $87 on 11/1. I saw some money was made today on my end due to the massacre which was once BYND value. Now I don\u2019t know what to do with the put. Do you sell the put itself, do you have to purchase the 100 shares? How do I know when is the best time to sell?
