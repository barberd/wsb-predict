Call flow everywhere, orders sliding in at 4:00-4:15, etc.  Today was different.  Today SPY struggled with $304-305.   It stop hunted to $299.47.  Call flow dried up; even when SPY was \"discounted\" at $299.  Nobody really took advantage of that.\n\nTheory:  there are no buyers left at these levels.  We may gap up to 309-310 early in the week.  But I think it will be a different story by the end of next week and continue a downward trend for part of June.\n\nNot saying be a bear, not saying be a bull, just saying to be wise and notice when things get quiet.  Trade with the flow of the market.", "created_utc": 1590785509.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gt12a8/iwm_qqq_spx_spy_option_flow_522_vs_529/", "is_self": true}
