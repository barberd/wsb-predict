This has knock-on effects on cash flow, maintenance, loans/mortgages, etc.\n\nIn the coming months since people are getting laid off and people in the states essentially don't have much savings or social security net, people will start to get evicted (Long process, no cash for AVB) and people will start to become late on their payments.   \n\n\n1. AVB hasn't fallen, people haven't started to bet against real estate rental\n2. Overbloated P/E, Huge amount of Debt 7.4 Billion in debt, Current Ratio 0.5 (Look up how low current ratio companies do in bear markets)\n3. Cash flow problem coming up, people will start delaying payments\n4. The government may step in, but don't expect everyones rent to get paid\n5. All their apartment complexes are located in Hot Zones atm... They are fucked \n   1. As of January 31, 2020, the company owned 79,636 apartment units, all of which were in New England, the New York City metropolitan area, the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, Seattle, and California. It is the 3rd largest owner of apartments in the United States\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFree Tendies you damn autists.", "created_utc": 1584640404.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fledt5/avalonbay_communities_dd/", "is_self": true}
