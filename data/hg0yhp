The supply of money has some effect, but not in the way most people think.\n\nWe live in a modern age where most dollars are never printed. They are added to bank accounts on computers when people get payed for work. Then they are moved to other places when people pay for things. Digital dollars are always being created and destroyed in this system. They are not each attached to some note printed in a treasury, or some ounce of gold in Fort Knox. interest is earned, stock value created and lost, trades made and currencies converted without paper or precious metal ever being involved.\n\nThe dollar is no longer a physical thing that can be contained and controlled. The federal reserve can apply the brakes to dollar creation by manipulating lending, but it does not control the supply by printing actual dollars.\n\nMany people who talk about \u2018fiat currency\u2019 a lot. Fiat currency is currency that is not backed by some commodity, like gold, silver or bushels of corn. \n\nThey\u2019ll go on about how nation\u2019s economies were destroyed by printing endless amounts of fiat currency, making each bank note printed worth less, until all of the notes out there became worthless. They are absolutely correct and will give you examples from the past where this was true.\n\nHowever, that horse left the barn decades ago.\n\nThe US Federal Reserve banks no longer create most of the actual dollars in circulation.\n\nWhen Apple stock goes from $26 per share to $126 per share, nobody prints extra dollars to represent that wealth created, but now it exists. The stock exchanges don\u2019t say, well we have to drop the price of IBM and Microsoft to make up for the gains at Apple.\n\nIt is not a zero sum game.\n\nWe have gone well beyond the quaint ideas of gold standards and fiat currency. However, gold standards were never standard either. The value of gold depended on, in part, supply and demand (just like fiat currencies do) and in part of fear, greed, emotions and so on. If people had little fear and were comfortable the price of gold is stable or reduces (regardless of supply). When people are fearful and insecure, the price of gold rises (regardless of supply).\n\nSo the post-fiat, non-gold-standard US dollar is based on the same variables that the value of gold has always been based on, it is just that the USA is in control of the variables. If the US is doing well, the dollar is strong, regardless of how much money gets dumped on the market. Of course, if the USA screws up its economy, then the dollar does poorly.\n\nThe economic crises in the 1970\u2019s and 1980\u2019s were happening when the first world countries were going through the transition from commodity based currencies to fiat to post-fiat currencies.\n\nI\u2019m sure economists have a name for whatever it is we call this post-fiat based currency. To many people it seems like phony money, but the value of gold was just as phony and made up as the value of currency is today.\n\nIts money. Its not real, its just something we have made up.", "created_utc": 1593145532.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hg0yhp/why_jpows_money_printer_wont_cause_hyperinflation/", "is_self": true}
