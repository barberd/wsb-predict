{"id": "fvjtra", "title": "Follow up on MAR DD", "selftext": "Hey, just a follow up on the indebtness analysis of MAR. \nNow down 15% since the DD.\n\nIt looks like pretty much everything I said happened, except it seems like the bank has waived the affirmative covenant as they let MAR withdraw 100% from their revolver.\n\n\n\u00ab\u00a0Marriott International Inc. (NASDAQ: MAR) said Friday it is borrowing $2 billion from an existing credit facility to increase its cash holdings and \u201cpreserve financial flexibility\u201d in the face of market uncertainty created by the coronavirus pandemic, according to Securities and Exchange Commission documents. The Bethesda hotel giant said it is maxing out its $4.5 million credit facility with its latest borrowing. As of March 17, the company had taken out $2.5 billion for the primary purpose of paying back matured promissory notes.\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\nSo what next? Well MAR is banking on the fact that the 2B extra cash withdrew will be enough to weather the storm. It also looks like they had either longer term paper reissuance or they replaced their balance with notes or had cash on hand.\n\n\nNow I guess the question is now that it dropped 15% is the DD priced in?\n\nThat is actually a really good question SP dropped 5% while MAR moved 3X, so part of the movement of MAR can be attributed to overall market sentiment, but at least a bit of the movement should be due to them drawing 100% of the revolver.\n\nMAR essentially has no money left they can borrow without significantly more expensive debt and being leveraged to the tits. We should be asking ourselves two questions. \n\nHow long can MAR survive with 2B$, and once market starts recovering, what return will be expected from the hotel industry. These two questions alone should help you define term and action plan for MAR. \n\nQ1 report will give a very clear indication of question #1, but will be priced in quickly.\n\nEnjoy the tendies.\n\nTLDR; how long do you think MAR can last with 2B$, barely any revenue, and reduced cost of doing business.", "created_utc": 1586115496.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fvjtra/follow_up_on_mar_dd/", "is_self": true}
