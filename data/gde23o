They're selling you seats in cars they don't own and that's all they do. But, they are not gonna crash due to earnings and here's why.\n\nThey're gonna hype up their \"essentials delivery\" business a ton. They're going to give it great guidance for Q2. Share price will either remain the same or even rise a bit after earnings.\n\nNote that this is a load of horseshit. Next earnings will be a shitshow because they're way too late to the game in the delivery space.\n\nMy overall price target for Lyft is <$18. Next earnings will be a shitshow. This earnings will be ok. Price drop will happen before earnings.
