Or that everybody will start buying cars or long term goods when their future is still uncertain. Lifting the lockdown orders does not mean restarting the economy. It is a fallacy to believe that. \n- a lot of bankruptcies and personal defaults are due to happen. I cannot believe that everybody has enough resources to survive a few months, especially in a world which is based on JIT (just in time) Think about the oil industry, especially shale oil, airlines, deep indebted companies, etc. \n- GDP, Q2, Q3 and Q4 are f$&@ed for sure for almost every f&$ing country/company on this flat \ud83c\udf0f \n\nIt is true that, like in every other recession/crisis that some will make good lots of \ud83d\udcb0, but this refers to a very small portion of companies. \n\nAm I retarded? (I presume the answer is yes, but please spare me)\nWhat am I missin\u2019?\n\nEDIT: I don\u2019t think the stock market will crash, or at least I don\u2019t expect a sudden fall. The big bad news aren\u2019t that likely to occur.
