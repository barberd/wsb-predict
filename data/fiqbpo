Could not find parking yesterday. No paper products in stock says a sign at the entrance. \n\nThey also ran out of airborne and any vitamin c supplements. First time I have seen empty racks in Costco. I mean two entire aisles were empty. No TP or kitchen towels. No rice bags. \n\nMajor companies have issued work from home. But traffic on the freeway is still decent which means people are still going to work. \n\nMost schools are closed and many are closing. \n\nPeople are still shopping and roaming around without much precautions. My friend who is a doctor said that people are not taking this serious and are not staying indoors.\n\nAirports are still very lax about people entering. They rely on honor system for people to set quarantine of they are sick. This is the biggest BS and this has helped Covid spread fast in the community. \n\nAlso heard people not being tested though they have fever and cough. Unless the condition is serious they are not tested. Check the numbers in Santa Clara. \n\nSanta Clara county is having a higher ratio of cases hospitalized to cases reported. Also they have a high ratio of community spread to total cases. \nhttps://www.ktvu.com/news/bay-area-announces-more-coronavirus-cases-and-new-protective-orders\n\nI think the virus is spreading real bad and we are not testing enough to contain it. \n\nAlso people who are sick are still working. Yesterday saw a grocery store clerk wearing a mask and then coughing and she ran away from the check stand and then another person took over. \n\nNot sure how many have to work because they have low income and have to work no matter what to meet ends meet. \n\nI don\u2019t know why people are in denial. I see people still shake hands and hug in public places.\n\nTL DR: stay safe, stay indoors and brace for a higher ratio of number of critical cases to number of total cases reported in the US.", "created_utc": 1584222959.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fiqbpo/sf_area_resident_update/", "is_self": true}
