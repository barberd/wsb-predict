If you consider just working days between then and now there have been 29 of them.\n\nIf your full time job was working for your wife's boyfriend and he made you walk non-stop for 8 hours straight every single weekday trying to outrun the stack of $100 bills the Fed has printed since then you would have only walked 719.2 miles (assuming average walking pace of 3.1mph which is generous for you, fatty, and you know it). In the same time period the Printed stack would be 1,308 miles long. Almost twice as far your cuck ass made it and it was your FULL TIME JOB TO WALK.\n\nEven if your wife's boyfriend really cracked the whip and made you walk seven days a week you STILL would have only walked 967.2 miles. \n\nFuck that's a lot of printing.", "created_utc": 1586574443.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fyv9l9/the_stack_of_100_bills_the_fed_has_printed_since/", "is_self": true}
