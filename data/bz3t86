Been watching an ascending trend on the daily with a breakout point around 7.25-7.30 to the upside where we just closed the day. Feels bullish to me if we breakout on tomorrow's open.

I'm aware I can get screwed if there is a retracement.", "created_utc": 1560203275, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bz3t86/what_do_you_guys_think_about_vslr/", "is_self": true}
