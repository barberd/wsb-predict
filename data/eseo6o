As nostalgia courses through his brain, hard seltzer courses through his veins; Becky moans\nlouder, reaching back in euphoria.\n\nSummer 2020 is coming\n\nThis year, there will be competition in the hard seltzer game.  Budweiser, which already owns Bon &amp; Viv (way better flavors than White Claw), [is set to announce a Bud Light Seltzer during the Super Bowl](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/21/hard-seltzer-is-here-to-stay-says-ceo-of-bud-lights-parent.html).  This will give them a seltzer product at three different price points:  Bon &amp; Viv will compete with the Claw,\nBud Light Seltz for the middle class/college kids, and Natty Light Seltzer for the poors.  With so many new options and memories attached to Bud, Chad is bound to give these new \noptions a shot.\n\n[Chart](https://imgur.com/iYpw4MG) is beaten down but showing a support level at $78, next stop being $65.
