{"id": "ghh7qk", "title": "Hey WSB, WTF is logistics?", "selftext": "Good evening autists,\n\nI've decided to make this post in order to give you all insight of what I see as a underexamined area of weakness (especially in this sub) and I believe is a possible harbinger of what lies ahead, which is the logistics industry. There are many moving parts and niches in the industry and most businesses rely on logistics services to support their operations (from the supply of raw materials, moving product from manufacturer to distribution center, clearing freight through customs, storage, or delivering final products to stores or customer's door). There are steamship lines (SSLs), airlines (ALs), freight forwarders, customs brokers, truckers, distribution centers, warehouses and they all participate to assist companies who import their products to different markets get them there as fast as possible (unless you're an SSL) at the lowest cost. \n\nThese services have allowed products to be made more cheaply internationally due to low labor/material costs, mainly, which in turn allows markets to buy them cheaper. For the US, this is critical because it doesn't really manufacture much anymore as it's moved on from a manufacturing economy to a more service based economy over a handful of decades (trade deficit for March increased to $44.4 billion difference in imports over exports  [https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/data/index.html](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/data/index.html) ).\n\n[We're on a downtrend due to trade war, which is good, but $44 bil on 3month avg is basically impossible to make up for in any kind of short-term basis.](https://preview.redd.it/f99u5orvnux41.png?width=842&format=png&auto=webp&s=82af082de1b528ddaf21556aa80d9a1e920a7980)\n\nWith this change from a manufacturing economy to a more service based economy, basic logistics services have seen steady growth for multiple decades. In general, when an industry is in its infancy, you have many small players (usually) and over time they consolidate. Well, this is similar to what's happened in the SSL sector of the logistics industry and this is where I'll start.\n\n**SSLs** \n\nYou can do your own research, or just take my word for it, but SSL alliances have picked up  starting the last decade or more ('08 recession put upward pressure on this) as record losses were prominent for almost all carriers due to over-supply and reducing demand. This fact then pushed them into rate wars (SSLs undercutting freight rates to push out competition). Rate wars then forced alliances among the SSLs. Larger players forming pacts with similar larger players in order to wipe out the smaller players, which in turn has forced the smaller players to build pacts in order to fight back. If you're wondering how this isn't an antitrust issue, it has been brought up and investigated by the DOJ though I'm not going full on into the weeds on that but basically, \"Antitrust investigators believe that due to a history of legally having the ability to discuss pricing under antitrust immunity, the industry lacks a disciplined culture and is therefore susceptible to illegal activity. For example, the DOJ regularly issues a statement raising concerns after the FMC allows a shipping alliance or major vessel-sharing agreement (VSA) to take effect\" \\* [https://www.joc.com/maritime-news/container-lines/us-antitrust-probe-container-shipping-ends\\_20190226.html](https://www.joc.com/maritime-news/container-lines/us-antitrust-probe-container-shipping-ends_20190226.html) (think OPEC-ish). With the formation of these pacts came investment in new containerships at a record pace. It was a race to see who could buy the largest ship in order to save cost through economies of scale and crush the competition on the highest traffic lanes globally (i.e. major import lanes like Shanghai to Los Angeles or Shanghai to Rotterdam). The first major player to fall was Korean SSL Hanjin just over 4 years ago. At the moment, we only have 3 alliances that control\\~80% of the capacity of ocean cargo transported globally. The breakdown of alliances is below ([https://www.morethanshipping.com/the-impact-of-the-container-shipping-alliances/](https://www.morethanshipping.com/the-impact-of-the-container-shipping-alliances/) ).\n\n[Pick your poison](https://preview.redd.it/am4yjxez5vx41.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e44651fa904fb9387bee8970113dbd80ef24896)\n\nHowever, unfettered competition remains within these main trades regardless of the alliances made. It is tantamount to a war of attrition and that is going to be devastating in the current environment. See below recent reports on SSLs.\n\nAn April 8th article in WSJ ( [https://www.wsj.com/articles/container-ship-operators-idle-ships-in-droves-on-falling-trade-demand-11586359002](https://www.wsj.com/articles/container-ship-operators-idle-ships-in-droves-on-falling-trade-demand-11586359002) ) stated the below points\n\n*  Container ship operators have idled a record 13% (OP Note: this easily beats the '08 recession) of their capacity over the past month as carriers at the foundation of global supply chains buckle down while restrictions under the coronavirus pandemic batter trade demand. \n*  Alphaliner, based in Paris, said more than 250 scheduled sailings will be canceled in the second quarter alone, with up to a third of capacity taken out in some trade routes. The biggest cutbacks so far have hit the world\u2019s main trade lanes, the Asia-Europe and trans-Pacific routes.\n*  Ship brokers say giant ships that move more than 20,000 containers each now are less than half full. \n* Sailing cancellations grew from 45 to 212 over the past week, according to Copenhagen-based consulting firm Sea-Intelligence. The \u201cblanked\u201d sailings are stretching into June, indicating operators expect the traditional peak shipping season, when retailers restock goods ahead of an expected buildup in consumer spending in the fall, will be muted this year by the lockdowns extending across economies world-wide.\n*  France\u2019s CMA CGM SA, the world\u2019s fourth-largest container line by capacity, said this week it is idling 15 ships because retailers are pulling back orders over falling demand from European and American consumers. \n*  The decision to idle, or \u201clay up,\u201d ships is a difficult option for owners, as the vessels continue to generate costs without offsetting income.  There are two ways to idle ships. In a \u201cwarm layup\u201d vessels are anchored and staffed, ready to go relatively quickly when demand resumes. This means saving on operating costs such as fuel but continuing to pay crew salaries and insurance fees and make charter payments.  In a \u201ccold layup\u201d a skeleton crew is kept on board for general maintenance but most of the ship\u2019s systems are shut down. Returning the ship to service can cost millions of dollars and requires extensive testing to certify that the ship is safe to sail. \n\nA May 4th article in WSJ ( [https://www.wsj.com/articles/some-shipping-lines-may-not-survive-downturn-hapag-lloyd-chief-says-11588612964](https://www.wsj.com/articles/some-shipping-lines-may-not-survive-downturn-hapag-lloyd-chief-says-11588612964) )  stated the below points.\n\n*  Some container shipping companies may collapse if the global trade downturn stemming from coronavirus lockdowns extends to the end of the year or beyond.\n*  The shipping lines that handle the biggest share of the world\u2019s international trade in retail and manufactured goods have canceled up to a quarter of their sailings since late February amid extensive lockdowns and collapsing demand in the U.S. and Europe.\n*  The world\u2019s top 10 liner companies, which collectively handle more than three-quarters of the world\u2019s oceangoing container trade, are looking at steep losses from the falling business.\n*  Germany\u2019s Hapag-Lloyd, the world\u2019s fifth-largest container line by capacity, according to industry data group Alphaliner, has canceled about 15% of its scheduled sailings on major ocean trade routes, including Asia-Europe and trans-Pacific operations.\n*  Some carriers are trying to preserve cash by taking longer trips around Africa instead of crossing the Suez Canal, saving on canal toll costs that can reach around $500,000 for a single big ship. With fuel prices sliding under the crash in oil prices, the cost of the longer sailing makes sense. (OP Note: This increases lead times for buyers and further disrupts company's supply chains)\n*  Hapag-Lloyd has thousands of land-based employees working from home and has frozen management salaries and returned leased ships to charterers. It is not looking at layoffs for now. But the carrier is pushing back an order of six megaships that move more than 20,000 containers each, to add to the six it already operates. Those megaships are the big losers with volumes crashing since many are sailing half full, giving up the benefits operators gain from the ships\u2019 economies of scale. \n\nKnowing the above, see a Feb 28th report ( [https://splash247.com/liner-bankruptcy-potential-at-highest-levels-recorded/](https://splash247.com/liner-bankruptcy-potential-at-highest-levels-recorded/) ) stating the below points.\n\n* The collective Altman Z score of the 14 container shipping companies that publish their financials deteriorated markedly in the 12 months ending September 30, 2019, falling to 1.16 from 1.35 in all of 2018 and thereby signifying a rising probability of bankruptcy.\n* \"IMO 2020 was already going to make this a year of huge disruption for the entire maritime industry,\" said Marc Lampieri, a managing director in the transportation and infrastructure practice at AlixPartners. \"Throw in the coronavirus, the recent deterioration of some key financial measures and whatever other unforeseen disruptions lie ahead, and it's clear that preparing for the worst may be the best way to avoid the worst.\"\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with the Z score formula it is a calculation that predicts the probability that a firm will go into bankruptcy within two years. Anything below a score of 1.8 is considered  a \"very high\" risk of bankruptcy.\n\nSo, if this industry sector was reduced to a 1.16 Z score for the 12 months ending Sept 2019 (5   \nSSLs produced a scores of less than 1 and all were under the 1.8 level), it's probably a safe bet this score has not gone up since. If more SSLs were to go bankrupt, this would further constrain capacity to even fewer SSLs who are already trying to minimize port calls and slow down how fast ships cycle through their scheduled port calls (their \"string\"), causing backlogs that in turn send freight rates higher. Part of the reason they do this is because of the headhaul vs. backhaul issue that occurs on many vessel strings (i.e. lots of freight moving from a ship's origin to particular destinations, but not from the destinations back to the ships origin or future port calls) causing them to issue \"blank sailings\" for some ports, which is their notice that the port will be skipped by a particular vessel. This causes many problems with equipment (container) availability and can further distort freight rates and cause backlogs. If they can only make money going one way, they're losing money more often than not. Furthermore, inactive containership capacity through 2020 is projected to move even higher, increasing the recent record statistic for the sector. Below articles for support.\n\nApril 8th article ([https://shippingwatch.com/carriers/Container/article12067889.ece](https://shippingwatch.com/carriers/Container/article12067889.ece)) stating the below points.\n\n*  The large scale sailing cancellations could push the inactive container ship fleet to over 3 Mteu in the coming weeks in the worst capacity crisis that the container shipping industry has ever seen.\n*  Several routes with usually large capacity will be fully canceled in the second quarter, including 2M's major AE-2/Swan service, where 12 ships of 23,000 teu sail between Asia and North Europe. \"No market segment will be spared, with capacity cuts announced across almost all key routes,\" writes the firm. \n\nAn article dated May 1st ( [https://theloadstar.com/europe-asia-ocean-rates-hit-new-heights-as-exporters-fight-for-what-space-remains/](https://theloadstar.com/europe-asia-ocean-rates-hit-new-heights-as-exporters-fight-for-what-space-remains/)) via the Loadstar provides an example of how capacity and rates can fluctuate and go haywire relatively quickly. Summary below.\n\n* Normally freight from Asia to Northern Europe is the headhaul (large volume) and the backhaul is NE to Asia (lower volume). However, due to lockdowns happening at different times in Asia vs Europe, this volume has fluctuated highly. Freight rates for NE to Asia in Jan were $500 for a 40' GP (40 ft. general purpose container), as China was in lockdown and demand was poor and space was plentiful. However, now that Europe is in lockdown and Asia is up and running, demand has spiked on the NE to Asia backhaul (as China lifted out of lockdown) and space is basically non-existent and has forced the rate for a 40' GP from a low of $500 in January to $2000 now in May. This is due to the fact that SSLs reverted to blank sailings for NE ports as demand in Europe dropped due to beervirus and caused freight rates to fall from Asia origins. They've been able to steady the rates at Asia origins at the cost of backlogs and rate spikes at backhaul ports.\n\nFor SSLs, the game is complicated and tricky while margins are razor thin and the coronavirus exacerbates this. They're trying to manage rates, whether or not to park vessels and how they should do that, which ports do they skip to save money, and how to keep cash flow (as most of them are very much in debt). Their actions then affect shippers and buyers worldwide and it becomes very difficult to manage costs through out global supply chains. When things are this uncertain, for all parties in logistics, sometimes it's like trying to catch a falling knife when moving cargo. If shippers/buyers time it right they can avoid extra costs but if they are trying to ship at the wrong time they're going to feel the pain in the form of high freight rates, delays (which increase storage/demurrage costs), and chargebacks from shipper's/buyer's customer who receive cargo late (depending on terms and conditions of their contracts).\n\n**SSL TL;DR** - Steamship lines have been broken for a while but beervirus has potential to be the catalyst to push many over the edge into insolvency.  In order to stabilize freight rates, SSLs have been parking container ships at a record pace with capacity projected to shrink by more than 3 million TEU (20' container equivalent), which has never happened before. The more SSLs revert to parking vessels in order to stabilize freight rates, the closer it pushes them to bankruptcy (a double edge sword, if you will) and in turn the more companies will pay to move freight in the future. Even if no SSLs go bankrupt, companies will be paying more to move freight regardless due to virus disruption.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ALs** \n\nThere has been much already addressed and available about the ALs and I'm just going to assume you're more aware of their history as compared to the SSLs, so I'll make this section short and only provide the details most of you might not get if you're not really involved with logistics.\n\nAn article published on May 4th ([https://www.stattimes.com/news/global-air-cargo-capacity-down-by-29-seabury-reports/](https://www.stattimes.com/news/global-air-cargo-capacity-down-by-29-seabury-reports/) ) stated the below points (w/ visuals).\n\n[You already knew this but ALs getting hammered due to passenger decline related to beervirus. That in turn has affected the flow and capacity of airfreight](https://preview.redd.it/tgsdn8iv8wx41.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=0cdcab91dab8360dd06677254d631cfc14fb4e35)\n\n[Passenger aircraft belly capacity reached an all time low at the beginning of April. It has rebounded slightly, but forecasts shows capacity will not be returning to normal in 2020](https://preview.redd.it/szx2tdeo9wx41.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4bbb75fe907b9a5306cb5aec00a85fd22b1db5f)\n\n* Global air cargo capacity is -29% on a YOY basis. (OP Note: A 23% increase in capacity was seen the week of April 22nd-28th for passenger belly aircraft, which is heartening, but considering capacity dropped well over 80%, this recent gain would only constitute \\~ 4.5% return to previously normal capacity seen at the beginning of February)\n* US- Europe lanes have have had the largest impact so far, but disturbances have been felt on every lane globally and the Europe/Africa, Europe/South America routes are still seeing capacity constraints between 60% and 88%.\n\nSo, matching the economic data we've seen recently, airline capacity data is abysmal.\n\nAnother article release today by the NY Times also states the dire circumstances ALs face currently ([https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/10/business/airlines-coronavirus-bleak-future.html?auth=link-dismiss-google1tap](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/10/business/airlines-coronavirus-bleak-future.html?auth=link-dismiss-google1tap)).  This article isn't particularly logistics focused, but it provides insight into the passenger side of ALs, which is where they make a majority of their revenue. I've added important points below.\n\n* Passenger traffic is down about 94% and half the industry's  6,215 planes are parked at major airports and desert airstrips.\n*  To get through the next few months, airlines successfully lobbied for a huge federal rescue. But half of that money was intended to cover payroll and that will run out by the end of September. \n*  Desperate to preserve cash, the airlines have also aggressively discouraged customers from seeking refunds, offering vouchers for future travel instead...(and) the industry trade group Airlines for America, said that refunding all tickets could lead to bankruptcy.\n*  Payrolls have largely been spared the ax, for now, because Congress set aside $25 billion to pay workers through September as long as airlines refrain from imposing furloughs or pay cuts. But some airlines have already tested those limits, and executives have signaled that layoffs will come when those protections expire. \n*  Most industry analysts and executives expect years to pass before airlines fly as many passengers as they did before the pandemic. Even then, a rebound may come in fits and starts, propelled by medical advancements, an economic rebound and shifts in the public\u2019s tolerance for risk. \n*  Take China, for example. The number of domestic flights there started to recover in mid-February, but plateaued in early March at just over 40 percent of levels before the outbreak, according to the International Air Transport Association, a global industry group. (OP Note: The gain back to 40% could be attributed to the large backlog left from China lockdown and Lunar New Year holiday at the beginning of Feb)\n*  The airlines are triaging. Even as they slim down to preserve cash, they are finding ways to make what little money they can. Many have put otherwise unneeded planes to use transporting cargo, including medical supplies, taking advantage of a spike in freight prices. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ALs TL;DR** \\-  With beervirus, passenger belly space has shrunk to unprecedented levels, causing air freight rates to increase by 5 or 6 times their normal costs on many lanes as planes are parked. Companies are forced to pay through the nose for air freight when cargo critical to their operations is needed due to SSL capacity constraints and the extended lead times across all modes of transportation. Companies trying to utilize air cargo will be paying higher costs indefinitely as air capacity doesn't look to return to normal within 2020.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast, I'd like to move on to look at US inventories and US consumer spending as they are the major catalyst when it comes to freight demand. Using US census data, summarized in the below table (this is preliminary data, so not reflecting recent update today but breakdown takes this into account) , [tradingeconomics.com](https://tradingeconomics.com) ( [https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/wholesale-inventories](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/wholesale-inventories) ) provides this breakdown of Us inventories:  \"Wholesale inventories in the US fell 0.8 percent month-over-month in March of 2020, less than an initial estimate of a 1 percent drop. Still, it is the biggest decline in inventories since September of 2011. Stocks of nondurable goods slumped 2.7 percent (vs \u20132.6 percent in the preliminary estimate), while durable goods inventories edged up 0.5 percent (vs 0.1 percent in the preliminary release). Year-on-year, wholesale inventories were down 1.7 percent in March.\"\n\n[ https:\\/\\/www.census.gov\\/econ\\/indicators\\/tab2adv.pdf ](https://preview.redd.it/xqkngw0riux41.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a4f2530dd3b08734851ee0e28de42412e959d56)\n\nTypically, high inventory points  to economic slowdown, while a low reading points to stronger growth. However, this generality is not true in the current environment. We're seeing inventories lower due to supply shocks presented by the beervirus but at the same time we're seeing major demand shocks so we have this peculiar instance where inventories have fallen the most in over a decade, but still did not fall as much as expected. \n\nNow look at consumer spending ( [https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/consumer-spending](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/consumer-spending) ). \n\n[Splash Mountain](https://preview.redd.it/g0o5kqy3x1y41.png?width=884&format=png&auto=webp&s=e36b82352914d5edb18afe064381b41e2ca9184d)\n\nAnd now with [tradingeconomics.com](https://tradingeconomics.com) forecast.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/657ykdocy1y41.png?width=875&format=png&auto=webp&s=76997dad3a5c80c6fe82186241cf690bf94f7cf6\n\nI argue that this shows supply is catching up to demand, as we can see that consumer spending has fallen off a cliff and is projected to fall further.\n\nSo, you might be wondering, what does all of this means and what am I getting at?\n\nWithin logistics there is a phenomenon that occurs when supply and demand are not managed and become dislocated. This is called the Bullwhip Effect. With the turmoil associated around major players in the logistics industry (SSLs & ALs) and general uncertainty in regards to the the economic outlook, we can expect increased costs associated with inventory, if companies have too much inventory (which is looking like the lesser of two evils IMO depending on the situation), or increased cost in freight spend, if companies don't have enough inventory (which, considering the wild swings in rates, could be devastating in cost). Either way, the point is cost. Costs are going to go up to move all the consumer goods we have been accustomed to buying so cheapy over the last decades of the expansion of the global market place that was supported by the expansion of capacity in global SSLs and ALs. That is why I'm not buying the deflation narrative that is being passed around currently and supported by the FED. Logistics services have been widely overlooked as a major contributor to the deflation in CPI we've seen over the last decade or so, as this coincides with the  alliances created in SSLs and rate wars that ensued. We will see consumer prices increase and inflation will return whether the economy rebound quickly or not. I am short gold, silver, and select precious metal equities, long on global risk assets until this mess can be sorted out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR -**  Logistics services have expanded with globalization and have become key players in keeping companies operating smoothly. SSLs have been creating alliances over the last decade, which caused rate wars (lowering freight costs). Due to beervirus, SSLs and ALs are severely hampered and are parking assets at a record pace, severely reducing capacity that is extremely difficult to expand in any kind of short-term basis. The disruption to supply chains will cause bullwhip effects across supply chains worldwide. This will raise prices for most goods with certainty.
