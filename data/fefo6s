With coronavirus coming to America, what better way to celebrate than with classic American entertainment: guns?\n\nAmerican Outdoor Brands Corp (formerly Smith & Wesson) is down 30% today after earnings. I'm using this as an opportunity to load up on cheap calls before everyone jumps on the bandwagon when this name is mentioned on CNBC or in some Bloomberg article.\n\nFor AOBC, the options are thin and the stock is moving fast so I'm not recommending anyone touch this. So far today I've purchased a small amount of the (all March expiration) 6.5's, 7's, and 8's.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKHC - Kraft has went a little under the radar for some reason, even with names like Campbell's and General Mills making nice moves. Yesterday there was a purchase of 20K OOM calls expiring 3/20, that went through just before the market closed.\n\nTo play this I'm buying the 26 strike March calls, but if you're really feeling dumb you can get the 27's for half the price.\n\nEdit: positions: http://imgur.com/a/529TA6w", "created_utc": 1583511118.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fefo6s/my_next_virus_plays_khc_aobc/", "is_self": true}
