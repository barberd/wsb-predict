I don't think he has any clue what this company even does.  Watch the interview on CNBC its embarrassing.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gL-bzYrt6tw&amp;t=86s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gL-bzYrt6tw&amp;t=86s) \n* Tech is legacy, people are moving away from Hadoop Distribution and cloud vendors are eating their lunch. Don't take my word for it, have a look at what the employees are saying on Glassdoor after the merger with competitor Hortonworks. \n* New products are being hyped but won't save them.\n* Company has never turned a profit, and I don't expect it to turn a profit in the near future. \n* Smart insiders have got out and are leaving you and Mr Icahn with a steaming bag of shit. \n* Talend looks like an interesting long against Cloudera as a short as they are winning a significant amount of new   \nenterprise business in the cloud.\n\nI expect this stock to trend back down to $5 a share.", "created_utc": 1576010830, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e8wg04/short_cloudera_cldr_dd/", "is_self": true}
