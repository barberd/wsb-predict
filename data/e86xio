Even with my margin included, they need me to deposit money to cover the 100 spy shares I am now the proud owner of. What's weird is my account balance doesnt reflect the spy shares, but their gain in value affected my p/l for friday, so i'm fucking confused. Messaged support but i'm definitely going to sell the shares at open and see wtf happens lol", "created_utc": 1575877676, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e86xio/robinhood_exercised_a_call_option_without_me/", "is_self": true}
