While we will get a bounce what normally happens after emergency fed action like this (with 2008-09 to look at) is we immediately have confidence in it and that confidence slowly diminishes over the next week or two so my bet is if we don\u2019t have a lower low this week we will by the following Monday. \n\nThey are literally doing this (the press conference at the end of trading Friday, this cut right before the open Monday) to inflate markets and what we need to realize is that those levels are artificially created and are bound to crash with even the smallest amount of bad news while we are in store for massive amounts of bad news. \n\nBe patient bears and maybe play a short dated call or two. Make your 100% and get out. Use that to short some more. \n\nThis is why you don\u2019t want to risk it all on those weeklies. \n\nHolding\nDis 4/17 $85put\nAapl 4/17 $140put\nMrna 4/17 $15 put\nBac 5/15 $13\nBAC 4/17 $15\nC 4/17 $35\nFb 4/17 $120 and $125\nCrm 4/17 $115\nSQ 4/17 $40\nDis 3/27 $80\n\nBuying Monday\nVxx 4/17 calls\nSpy 5/15 puts \nQqq 5/15 puts\nNflx  4/17puts\n\nHolding $1000 bucks to buy puts or calls at 3:55\nCalls (3/27)to be sold immediately the following day and 5/15 puts.", "created_utc": 1584309893.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fj9gpy/unprecedented_move_by_the_fed_and_other_central/", "is_self": true}
