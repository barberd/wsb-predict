Uber's fundamentals haven't changed overnight.  They're still the favorite for long term market domination and ownership.  \n\nThey faced solid support at $40 for weeks (which is still below IPO price), and the recent dip is just beer virus panic.  As a supply constrained company, they'll stand to benefit from a recession (they get to pay drivers less because theres more demand for work), and demand is largely a function of price. \n\nAnyway, 0.50c $40 3/20 calls looking mighty cheap right now.", "created_utc": 1582661576, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9gc6x/uber_on_deep_discount_today/", "is_self": true}
