{"id": "f9b4zo", "title": "A Bulls Wet Coronavirus Dream", "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring this time of crisis where the bat soups aids virus is running rampant through china and the market is finally recognizing the near catastrophic result of the shutdown of one of the worlds largest producers of consumer goods, because the big guys here in america like to take advantage of the cheap labor overseas. The market\u2019s been tanking the last couple days, it seems like nothing was green, hopefully the next few days will be a different story but who knows when it will recover. \n\nThe other day I heard an international student at my university talking about how his sister was using online programs to take her courses for highschool. This got me thinking, what if there were companies in china who\u2019s business model naturally solves a problem created by the virus like the lack of attendance  at schools? Online education, **schools in China have been put on indefinite shutdown since the 17th**. Below I\u2019ve linked an article where they interview a young student who talks about her use of online education tools to continue her normal daily activity.\n\nhttp://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-02/17/c\\_138792006.htm \n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/19/coronavirus-chinas-after-school-programs-to-shut-down-or-move-online.html\n\nThis huge demand for education creates one of few areas in the market that remain green. Universities use their own programs to teach online courses but the k-12 grades are much more likely to use similar or the same programs to teach their students.  The one that I\u2019ve been looking at is **GSX Techedu ($GSX).**\n\nhttp://gsx.investorroom.com\n\n\u201cGSX Techedu Inc. (NYSE: GSX) (\u201cGSX Techedu\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) is a technology-driven education company and a leading online K-12 large-class after-school tutoring service provider in China. GSX Techedu offers K-12 courses covering all primary and secondary grades as well as foreign language, professional and interest courses. GSX Techedu adopts an online live large-class format to deliver its courses, which the Company believes is the most effective and scalable model to disseminate scarce high-quality teaching resources to aspiring students in China\u201d\n\n**The Q4 earnings for 2019 were expected to be $0.09 EPS, what they actually got was $0.70. These earnings came out on Feb 18th.**\n\n\\-**Quarterly Results:**\n\n*  Net Revenues up by 412.9% Year-Over-Year\n*  Net Income up by 658.7% Year-Over-Year\n*  Non-GAAP net income up by 616.7% Year-Over-Year\n*  Cash, cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments totaled up by 1,056.7% Year-Over-  Year\n\n\\-**Fiscal Year Results:**\n\n*  Net Revenues up by 432.3%\n*  Net Income up by 1,050.3%\n*  Non-GAAP net income up by 1,020.7%\n\nI believe this is also a safe longer play as well, even if the coronavirus is finally stopped by some miracle, which it wont be, this period of time in china will normalize online education as a daily tool. There are several companies like this but GSX is the one that I think has the most potential to really take off in the coming weeks based on the earnings report. If anyone has any ideas about other companies with similar potential I would love to hear some more real big brain autist logic to try and make us back our money we\u2019ve lost. \n\n[My position is 3/20 $60c](https://imgur.com/pQKIzHw) (got fucked by robinhood on the premium), I don\u2019t have the money to get any safer options so I gotta put it on this one, I lost all of my $SPCE tendies I made on my first options trade and am starting from the bottom again, if you can afford it I\u2019d go with the $50c of the same date.\n\n**TL;DR: Bat soup means kids need to go online to learn, $GSX 3/20 60/55c.**", "created_utc": 1582641330, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9b4zo/a_bulls_wet_coronavirus_dream/", "is_self": true}
