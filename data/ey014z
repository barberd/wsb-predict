Fishers. People who in the most retarded of their pedigree test their bullshit, sounding retarded but legitimate in their positions are really just testing. A form of deception \u2014 an assessment to address their actual trade.\n\n2.) Faux Traders. Those who boast of positions and profits without such evident. As they say in the casino: a \u201cwinner\u201d never discusses his losses. Conceive if the LV strip had a Reddit Forum. \n\n3.) Raiders. Passive readers of computers who ping the sentiment of the retail option investor. I imagine with 800k users some quant at Goldman already has you all figured out. Think about it. Does a sheep really know when it\u2019s being sheared? \n\n4.) The dog. Most likely coming off his coke high he\u2019s paying 7% interest on, the dog occasionally comes up with a legitimate idea, but otherwise, we find his posts disturbing as if it\u2019s come down to his last play or arson. \n\n5.) The Canadian/Bernie Bro. Those who have access to the US stock market and fall under the EST time zone. These people seem cool and collected, that no matter how they trade, they can still wait in line 5 months for that free MRI. By the time we hear back from them, they\u2019ve already left like a cool breeze. Cancer didn\u2019t wait. \n\n6.) Loopy. Those who get their trading news aggregated by the same algorithms that track them on their FB, Twitter, etc. engage in what\u2019s called a \u201cfeedback loop\u201d.  Is it YOU who\u2019s being traded?\n\n7.) Retail me not. Those who work at one of hundreds of Walmart\u2019s or Amazon fulfillment plants with Yacht intentions. As if a $800 customized option will save you from pissing in a can on the job. As the Lady Gaga says \u201cKeep following your dreams\u201d.\n\n9.) The world traveler. Think you can turn your 10k fortune into 80k with a swing of a virus? Think again. Central Banks beat you to the punch. JPow still has his finger on the button but you can\u2019t trade from a contamination zone. Pleb.\n\n10.) The indignant worshiper. Trump might as well live in your head rent free. You own the MAGA hat for metaphysical encouragement. It may do something for your portfolio. Until the show started \u2014 you had no idea. The Twitter was just a ruse. You FOUND that spot nobody saw. SPY does a little for you, but you never get off the ground. The idolatry took precedent over the portfolio.", "created_utc": 1580697826, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ey014z/wsb_a_proper_roast/", "is_self": true}
