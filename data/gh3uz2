Oil still has large moves in the near future, but, who cares which way it goes? Straddles on SCO. NFA, just what I am doing with my personnel trump bucks.***\n\nIf you look at my post from last weekend, you will see 6 points that I am following currently. 1 point is the June expiration of WTI oil. I don't have time to update everything this weekend, maybe I will this week. The background framework is all coming from Macrovoices, and their slidedeck is linked here: https://www.macrovoices.com/guest-content/list-guest-publications/3670-bigpicture-trading-chart-book-may-7-2020/file\n\n***Background:*** The massive drop in demand for oil (shutdown for CV) caused a glut due to the time required for an industry to react (to finally make a costly shut-in decision). The May WTI oil contract went negative in April due to a limited volume of speculative traders who remained in the market until just before expiration, and who found themselves with no free (re: non-reserved) storage. Negative prices ensued. This negative pricing was one of many signals to oil producers that they must shut in. A resolution was also needed to assist with the short term excess oil, which resulted in tankers being called on for floating storage -> limited supply = price skyrocketed. \n\n***What happens next depends on your view on the data, which you can review on your own. Two conclusions:***\n\n***A. Oil Bulls:*** We have shut in enough wells, have limited oil build, increased usage + near-term further increased usage is coming. This means, floating storage is no longer as in demand as it once was, and tankers, even having a great quarter or two or four (if they got booked out for the next 6-18 months) will not scream higher. The short term economics become less important compared to the long term trend in tankers, which was not great. Massive dividends this year? This signals the company has nowhere they would invest which would bring a greater benefit to investors. Even in a depression / lockdown environment, do we really think oil demand will stay -30 to -40% below average 2019 usage? And if so, do we really think oil producers wouldn't / won't shut in their wells, rather than sell into a market with such depressed pricing? Oil prices will go higher due to the resolution of the short-term issues stemming from the initial response to the corona virus + the Russian and Saudi oil tiff. Speculators have been limited from the leading month contracts by their brokers, reducing the risk of a large price shift at expiration. USO has been neutered and isn't acting as a roll-over whale anymore. \n\n***B. Oil Bears:*** We are seeing misleading indicators and we still have a major problem approaching. Oil producers did not react quick enough to the market signal, and we have a glut of oil still flowing into Cushing, OK. Oil tankers as floating storage are still needed and will be for the forseeable future. The rate of flows into Cushing is not continuing at the previous elevated pace, due to an approach to working capacity limiting the rate of fill + alternative storage being sought. Producers cannot shut-in their wells due to bankruptcy concerns, and the government has already intervened by signaling they will bail out the industry. If the government is bailing them out, the risk has just decreased massively, leading to a push to continue producing, rather than shutting off the money supply. Further, since many of these producers have already sold their oil before they pull it out of the ground, they are not incentivized to solve the storage issue. The oil is the problem of the trader at the other end of the contract. The Texas Railroad Commission has not acted to reduce production, which may have helped pricing elevate. Additionally, the companies weighing a V-shaped recovery, meaning the demand increases they see right now will only keep going up, are completely wrong. No faith in the Trump administration + CV = further lockdown, or, consumer behavior is changed so greatly, that oil demand will never catch up to 2019 levels.\n\nThe moves I am examining is SCO (Inverse oil ETF), for both perspectives. Here are a few plays:\n\n***A. Oil Bull***\n\n1. Low Risk - SCO Call Credit Spreads - Now, low risk is all relative, but a nice credit spread (When IV is as high as it is ~150) would benefit from a further regression to the mean (~50) + oil price continuing to recover. If we wind up in a low-movement situation, you still collect premium on theta decay.\n\n2. Medium Risk - SCO Put Debit Spreads - Same idea as above, but with greater max returns. You are now fighting IV, but, there is still a long way left for SCO to drop if oil climbs back to 30, 40, 50. \n\n3. JTTT Risk - Far OTM FD Puts on the notion that the economy will restart quicker than we can produce (it takes a long time to bring capacity back after you shut it off). This skyrocketing in oil prices would mean a cratering of SCO.\n\n\n***B. Oil Bear:***\n\n1. Low Risk - SCO Shares - averaging into a position starting Monday and going through Wednesday, expecting fireworks during the June WTI contract expiration. Taking profits as early as Friday 15th / Monday 18th depending on movement. May hold through the next several weeks if it seems we will lockdown again. If there is limited movement, exiting as appropriate.:\n\n2. Medium Risk - looking at another drop in oil going through the contract expiration and / or news of further lockdown (bzw. further near term demand reduction). Call Debit Spreads.\n\n3. JTTT Risk - Far OTM FD Calls on the notion that the economy is fucked and demand will remain low on further lockdowns + oil producers have not reduced production enough, and a contract expiration event will lead to negative prices again. \n\n***C. Playing Volatility:***\n\n1. Looking back two months (March) we see an IV spike due to the Saudi / Russia Oil Crisis. Looking back one month, we see the May WTI contract expiration (IV went to 400). We can build out a straddle, if we think the market is going to come to make a big move at some point soon.\n\nSCO is not super high volume on options, but there is enough reactivity to pricing changes of oil that I find this ETF worth creating plays for. Remember this when you look at strange dates + strikes -> Don't build something out that looks amazing on a calculator, only to find yourself stuck. Find expiration dates with higher volume, and round strike prices to ensure someone out there will buy it from you once you've juiced it.", "created_utc": 1589125802.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gh3uz2/oil_tankers_and_turmoil_upcoming_events_and/", "is_self": true}
