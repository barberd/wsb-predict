{"id": "gndfi4", "title": "The Passive-Investing Bubble and Why You Should Short This Pump", "selftext": "I believe that the rally we're seeing now and what many economists and hedge fund managers have flagged as insane implied valuations is a direct result of the 'passive-investing bubble' that several prominent traders, including Michael Burry, have called out recently. With institutional and retail investors considering ETFs and Index Funds safe-haven assets, they can pump massive amounts of capital into all equities at once without actually evaluating the underlying long-term viability of companies contained/indexed against them. In fact, active management has [generally outperformed](https://www.hartfordfunds.com/dam/en/docs/pub/whitepapers/WP287.pdf) passive during recessions. And this lack of price discovery is especially dangerous right now--because stocks of companies that will probably file for bankruptcy by the end of the year are experiencing rallies back to bull-market valuations. \n\nAnd there will be more and more bankruptcies. Corporate-debt-to-GDP will make an all-time high this quarter that will probably never be achieved again. Household debt won't be far behind. And while the Fed might be able to solve short-term liquidity issues, it's not going to be enough to keep companies afloat who never see pre-covid revenues again. Junk bond defaults are expected to climb as high as 10%-15%.\\*\n\n**Corporate Debt / GDP**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/geyqpocdmxz41.png?width=1796&format=png&auto=webp&s=aea4e467779184266d8399a08f31a9035282b5d0\n\nThe passive-investing issue is exacerbated now (more than in, say, 2008) because companies with the largest market capitalizations are also those best poised to benefit from the further digitalization of American life. Sure, Amazon, Google and Apple might actually come out of this as winners, even with a multi-year drop in average consumer spending due to massive unemployment and necessities-only shopping, because shifts in consumer behavior can inflate the value of their offerings. But that's not a rising tide that should be lifting all boats. Some of these boats are absolutely going to sink. And soon. \n\nBut how soon is impossible to tell, though I do believe that the economic reality will eventually catch up with the market. My best guess is that we're approaching the bear-market-rally top this week. Previous crashes have typically run back up to touch the 200-day moving average\\*\\*, which right now sits at about SPY 299. And while we're making new swing highs right now, it's apparent from the past three weeks of bouncing between 280-295 (and the incredibly low volume on many of the green days) that this buying pressure is reaching exhaustion. And as institutional investors start to second-guess the valuations and dump assets, retail will be in a bigger hurry than ever to follow suit. \n\n\\*The bond market presumably accounts for this with higher yields, though today they are nowhere near the heights of prior recessions, so I'm a little skeptical they're accounting for the number of fallen angels likely in the next 12 months\n\n\\*\\*I know, I know. TA is bullshit. I agree, but reaching long-term moving averages are important milestones because they reflect the mindset that 'everything is fine and will continue to be.' I don't think investors are really at that level of optimism yet. They certainly weren't during previous crashes. \n\nSPY 6/19 270p", "created_utc": 1589988595.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gndfi4/the_passiveinvesting_bubble_and_why_you_should/", "is_self": true}
