{"id": "cminat", "title": "Mastercard calls spiking up 600%", "selftext": "I bought a ton of calls on MA with 9/20 exp. I sold all but 3 last Friday. The three that didn't close are $325 strikes.\n\nThat said I have no clue what is going on with these calls. Forget the fact I couldn't close them out when they were worth a shit, but now they are oddly worth waayy more. No volatility spikes, but multiple times today and even last week these have momentarily spiked with the stock constantly dropping. \n\nMA is currently sitting around 255, with 33% VI and these options are up 160%. The most they've hit on multiple occassions was 600%. I'm totally confused on what is driving this.\n\nAnyone want to throw me a bone and explain why my pee brain doesn't understand this?", "created_utc": 1565047124, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cminat/mastercard_calls_spiking_up_600/", "is_self": true}
