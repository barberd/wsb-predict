It seems to me that AMD SP has stalled out lately... I know they have a large 7nm product line launch middle of Q2, but even so, I have lost hope of stock hitting $50 (or higher) any time in the near future. The all time high of AMD was $44 and that would equal $660,000 today. Now if I were to sell part of those shares to purchase 1,000,000 XRP, every $1 XRP goes up would equal $1,000,000. The all time high of XRP was $3.92 so that would have equaled $3,920,000 today. Thoughts?
