But today there is some real news. The only remaining cloud on the stock price has cleared today: The share dilution. The public offering is done. Shares have already been diluted. It is a done deal. Offering price was 9.50. Turns out we had been going through the the dilution the past week.\n\n[http://finance.yahoo.com/news/pg-e-said-raise-5-014354042.html?soc\\_src=community&soc\\_trk=ma](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/pg-e-said-raise-5-014354042.html?soc_src=community&soc_trk=ma)\n\nFor shareholders, this is most likely the bottom. There will not be selling pressure anymore to keep the price in the 9-11 band. After July 1st, institutions held on the sidelines due to the bankruptcy will start to come in. It can only go up from here. Expect some modest spike tomorrow.\n\nFuture wild fire liabilities up to 20B will be a non-issue from now on. PG&E is now eligible for the wildfire(or wild life) insurance fund of California. No more selling pressure. The dilution is done deal. Debt raising is done. Bankruptcy exit is all but a certainty. The time to get in before the institutions is now.\n\nTLDR Buy PCG shares. Do not buy calls. Do not take the market risk on this. Too many people got burned by calls on this.", "created_utc": 1593144853.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hg0sys/pcg_10th_time_is_the_charm/", "is_self": true}
