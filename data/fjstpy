Doubled down and went all in on CCL RCL DAL UAL AAL DIS and BA puts. Biggest gain was \\~10k last Thursday from BA. Never thought being a \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b would pay off as it has. Pulled an r/investing after close today and took out 2k to YOLO the rest. Tomorrow all in on SPY $69p 3/20.", "created_utc": 1584394228.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjstpy/26k_over_the_past_month_thanks_to_the_fellow/", "is_self": true}
