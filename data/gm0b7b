{"id": "gm0b7b", "title": "McDiesel and my thoughts.", "selftext": "$MCD, daddy orange's lunch lady and the sower of intestinal discomfort across the globe. \n\nStill yet to recover from its post COVID-19 drop trading around the $170 range yielding 2.85% dividend per year. Essentially the leader in fast food, McDonald's has faired exceptionally well in international markets due to its ability to adjust dining options/menu composition in order to match local markets tastes. Furthermore, domestically speaking $MCD has been cognizant of the rise of Chic-Fil-A and American's increasing consumption of chicken and decreasing consumption of beef, leading to its decision to focus and invest heavily on upgrading/transitioning its domestic menu have more of a focus on chicken in the future.\n\nRecent large scale acquisitions: One was that of an Israeli marketing technology firm by the name of Dynamic Yield Ltd. Essentially this company focuses on ways to use real time data in order to drive sales. In regard to $MCD this could be used to actively change the digital menu board due to varying stimuli such as changes in temperature or weather trends or even individual sales at a specific location or region.\n\nThe most recent acquisition, however, was that of Apprente, another tech company focused on AI speech technology. Here the idea is pretty obvious in that McDonalds is hoping to use this tech in regard to their drive through business model, ultimately cutting labor costs and/or increasing efficiency. \n\nThis brings me to one of the biggest points of this post. Ultimately I believe McDonald's foray into tech is a sign of why it's an industry leader. Just as it discovered in the early days of fast food the necessity of the franchise model, or how in the early day of American fast food restaurants expanding globally it was McDonalds who first realized that changing the menu to address local tastes was key, it will also be McDonalds who is the first fast food restaurant to leverage AI and tech to drive up its sales in an ever competitive market.\n\n Recent company turmoil was caused by firing of their CEO who was banging a work colleague. This initially had a negative effect on share value, but the stock has since stabilized and the new blood hired may be able to address problems the former CEO was ignorant of. Competition in the fast food industry is notoriously cut throat, however$MCD has faired well in the burger/sandwich field with the incompetencies of both Wendy's and Burger King to sizable take market share away from Mcdonalds. Furthermore, the fast casual sector with the likes of 5-Guys and Shakeshack is slowly dying off as people begin to realize the absurdity of paying $12 bucks for a shit bomb greasy burger.\n\nThe main threat to $MCD comes from the success of Chic-Fil-A, however McDonalds benifits from Chic-Fil-A's refusal to go public, significantly limiting their access to capital and thus slowing their expansion. All while McDonalds seeks to solidify their exposure the the US fast food chicken market.\n\nSo, why am I saying this? Ultimately, during the crazy COVID-19 times in combination with $MCD's recent price decline from $220 to $170 now is the chance to buy an industry leaders stock at a fairly signifigant discount. Considering the consistant gains in equity valuation $MCD has experienced over the entirety of its lifetime this could be a convenient play for this market environment. If you are worried of a future drop in equity prices from COVID-19, $MCD is known to fair well over long bear term bear markets, just look at its performance during -08. If you believe the bull trend will continue but want something that is not priced in/over priced, $MCD could also be seen as a good choice as it has yet to recover much in terms of equity price since the initial COVID-19 drop. This all while boasting a signifigant 2.85% dividend yield that is considered one of the safest in the industry. Ultimately this would be a good equity to consider for a long term hold, essentially a position that you can use to tell yourself that the options trading you do is justified as you have a sound investment portfolio unlike most.\n\nTL:DR \n\nGet Fucked", "created_utc": 1589803971.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gm0b7b/mcdiesel_and_my_thoughts/", "is_self": true}
