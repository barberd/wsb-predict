As we approached 4, TQQQ jumps over 107 and closes at 107.02. Phew, I collect the premium right? Well if you would\u2019ve thought that you\u2019re fucking wrong. \n\nFucking TD Ameritrade decides to wait 30 minutes, the stock drops to like 106.80, and they fucking assign me. I\u2019m in Mexico and it\u2019s impossible to get through to anyone so I have to wait until I\u2019m back in the states Sunday night o figure this shit out.\n\nI wake up this morning to an email about a margin call and find that I have 200 fucking thousand dollars worth of TQQQ that I have to sit on over the weekend with 30 margin call messages. \n\nWhat\u2019s even worse? The price is now at 106.50 and Americans are dying from the Modelo cold. So, will TD Ameritrade freak out and sell this for me before open on Monday? I\u2019m positive it\u2019ll be at like 105 by then so I\u2019m going to get fucked hard. Can I bitch to anyone?
