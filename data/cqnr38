{"id": "cqnr38", "title": "All in for tendies time, DD inside", "selftext": "Ok look here you fags, I've been tracking the market via quarter flips for the past few hours. My system is 2 coin flips each time I need to make a move... And here's my system: if 2 heads buy calls, if 2 tails buy puts, if 1 each do nothing because it's a 50/50 chance and I don't do risk, I win. I win so much it hurts. AAAAND it's time TO. MAKE. A. MOVE. Tariff man is at it again. WHICH MEANS... I busted out my trusty quarter.\n\nSo far I've been wrong about 8/10 times I've tried my method. And I just fucking flipped two tails.  \n\n\nDo you know what that fucking means you autistic fucks? DO YOU, it means that if you have two brain cells to run together and a few grand laying around it's time to all in on the market.  there's an 80% chance that I'm wrong, and if you do that rounding shit they supposedly taught in school. I wouldn't know because I was too busy fucking your mom and eating her tendies.\n\nIT MEANS 80%=100%\n\nSOOOOOOO . There's a 100% chance if you go all in on calls on AMD (little know fact but and stands for A MONEY making DEVICE, just the retards on wall street forgot the other M) you make FREE MONEY.\n\nLITERALLY CAN'T GO TITS UP.\n\n\nThank me later, I'll see you in Cancun on my private yacht.", "created_utc": 1565862959, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cqnr38/all_in_for_tendies_time_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
