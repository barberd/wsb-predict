If we can compromise one of the programmers over at Robinhood we can make some serious tendies.\n\nYou know that horizontal line on the Robinhood charts? Well after 5 years I just learned that represents yesterday's closing price. All we have to do is get a programmer to change that variable from \"yesterday\\_close\" to \"tomorrow\\_close\", and BAM! we know exactly where the stock is going.\n\nStealth tendies for at least a year before CNBC notices. Do any of you fine gentlemen know a Robinhood programmer? I'm sure we could make it worth his while ;)", "created_utc": 1573746934, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dwbe62/changing_the_robinhood_code/", "is_self": true}
