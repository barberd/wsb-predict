Turkey got kicked out of its supply chain because they wanted to buy Rooskie S-400 air defenses. In the process, it also threw a wrench in the works for the overall F-35 supply chain. \n\nBut now, it looks like Turkey might be coming back in. \n\nAlso, if Turkey manages to buy the F-35 again *and* gets to operate it alongside the S-400, it means the Russians will get extensive data about the F-35, its stealth features, and a bunch of other shit that they couldn't even dream of getting. \n\nAnd you can bet they'll sell that shit to their buddies in China. \n\nWhich means Lockheed will likely have to go back to the drawing board for a ton of other features, which means more money from Uncle Sam, which means tendies for you warmongering autists.\n\nObligatory: sir this is a Wendy's", "created_utc": 1570742561, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dg4s27/buy_calls_on_lmt_lindsey_graham_just_admitted_he/", "is_self": true}
