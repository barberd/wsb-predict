{"id": "g7z3qq", "title": "The dumpster fire that is Wingstop", "selftext": "**Idea**: Shorts and Puts on WING\n\n**Background**: Wingstop is a franchise based chicken wing fast food restaurant with 1253 domestic stores and 160 international stores. They only have 32 company owned stores which means reduced overhead cost and more reliance on the franchise segment of the company. Their revenue for franchisees in 2019 was 144.22M and their company stores was 55.45M. Profits for Franchise being 33.68M and company stores being only 9.2M. Current market cap is $3.37B and is currently trading at new all time highs at $114.40.\n\n**Financials**:\n\nThey are currently flexing a PE ratio of 165.18 which implies Wing has more growth potential than Amzn with its PE ratio of 104.71. Though their revenue has been increasing annually with\n\n133.32M in 2017\n\n153.18M in 2018\n\n199.68M in 2019\n\nWhile revenue has been steadily increasing, their net has been steadily declining due to the growing interest expense due to their new loans. 5M in interest expense in 2017, 10M in 2018 and 17M in 2019.\n\nNet 23.94M 2017\n\nNet 21.72M 2018\n\nNet 20.48M 2019\n\nWing has one of the worse balance sheets I have ever seen for a company valued above 1B dollars. Their current assets for 2019 was only 30.19M and their total assets only added up to 173.91M which counts 99.34M of intangible assets 50.19M of that was considered Net Goodwill which we all know isn't really an asset. Here's the disgusting part tho they recently took on a 300M dollar loan which matures in 2023. Increasing their total liabilities to 383.34M which is more than double their current assets which factor in 99.34M of intangible assets. Without the intangible assets being counted Wing would only have 74.57M in total assets which is more than 5 times less than their liabilities. This is the definition of being leveraged to the tits.\n\n**April 7th 8-K report**:\n\nWingstop had an open letter to their investors, I am just going to quote notable points\n\n\" we implemented a restaurant team member compensation incentive extending through April 30, 2020 that could provide as much as an additional $150 to full-time team members each week\" - Increased overhead but granted not by much.\n\n\" Off-premise dining has historically been one of our differentiators and the Wingstop team is humbled by the trust our guests have placed in us as we continue to serve during this challenging time. Our business was well-positioned for the transition to 100% off-premise dining that has resulted from COVID-19. Carry-out and delivery represented approximately 80% of our sales mix before COVID-19, and our digital sales mix was just over 40% leading into COVID-19 \"\n\n**Preliminary Estimated First Quarter 2020 Sales (UNAUDITED)**\n\nDec 29 2019 - Jan 25 2020-\n\nDomestic Same Stores Sales +Grew 11.5%\n\nCompany Owned Restaurant Same Store Sales Grew +6.1%\n\nJan 26-Feb 22\n\n\\+10%\n\n\\+5.2%\n\nFeb 23-Mar 28\n\n\\+8.6%\n\n\\+7.0%\n\nSo obviously this is fairly bullish news as they are actually managing to see some growth during the pandemic. The numbers might signal great fundamental growth until you realize the numbers they are flexing are the total amount of chicken wings sold but most of the company's money doesn't even come from sales but in actuality its the fees and royalties they charge their franchisees. I have read through their 10k and financial data trying to see how much of their revenue is based solely on Royalty revenue (Wingstop charges its franchisees 5-6% of each store's total sales) December 28th 2019 only 75M of the 200M revenue came from royalty revenue (which includes the 160 international stores, 11% of their stores, that are expected to take a massive hit in the coming quarters) So to summarize this growth that the CEO keeps bringing up affects less than half of their revenue so I do not expect a crazy revenue growth that the market and CEO is hyping up.\n\n**Revenue Breakdown** \\-\n\nRoyalty revenue, franchise fees and other- 44.2%\n\nAdvertising fees and related income 28%\n\nCompany owned restaurant sales - 27.8%\n\nAlso apparently there is an \"increased supply of chicken breast meat needed to support grocery stores where volumes have escalated, which has resulted in excess supply of jumbo chicken wings which is in turn creating a deflationary wing price\" which should also help them out in the short term, but admittedly I doubt this is significantly impactful as the cost of chicken wings was already dirt cheap compared to the markup.\n\nWhile domestically they have been seeing modest growth, \" Temporary closures in international operations have been necessary and, in some cases, mandated. Most of our international restaurants enjoy a robust dine-in business, generally driven by their locations, including malls and high-density gathering areas.\" International stores being about 11% of their stores and with a majority of them being closed down for an unknown period of time we can assume a decrease in international revenue of at least 6-7% depending on the actual number of closed stores, which would theoretically negate the growth we are seeing domestically.\n\nLiquidity - \"With uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 events, and as a cautionary measure, the Company borrowed $16 million under its outstanding variable funding notes to improve its cash position, providing the Company with an unrestricted cash balance of approximately $31 million at the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2020 compared to $12.8 million as of December 28, 2019.\"\n\nAfter completely depeleting most of their available credit lines due to the 300M loan they took our recently they were only able to gather $31M in cash for a company valued at $3.37B.\n\n**Growth Strategy**:\n\nThe overall strategy for wingstop is to expand as much as possible pushing hard to open more stores. This is the only reason revenue have been growing, due to the increasing number of new stores being opened up each year. If Covid-19 were to significantly impact their growth strategy then we will see revenues flatten or decline and the CEO has already acknowledged concerns over their growth strategy in the coming quarters \" we expect a near-term impact to our development pipeline as a result of availability of construction, permitting, and inspections resources in this current environment.\" Wingstop franchises are essentially small businesses which we all know will be taking a huge hit in the upcoming future and I do not believe Wingstop will be able to meet the growth expectations it is currently being valued at.\n\n**Insider Trading:**\n\nThis is hardly concrete DD but my approach is get all the possible info you can out so you can start to put together the puzzle easier. On March 5th Charles Robert Morrison - Chairman, President and CEO sold 35,125 shares of WING at $81.20 close to 3 million in value, and on the 9th he sold another 1,000 shares at $75.64. There were 0 shares bought from insiders in the past 12 months. The total insider transaction in the past 6 months were -35.15%. The company executives aren't even bullish on their own company.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWingstop was overvalued pre corona and now even more overvalued with corona. This is purely subjective and speculative but I do not expect enough consumers to be rushing to buy wings to justify the recent rally and valuation. Regardless if we open up or not, I have a hard time believing the first restaurant you'll want to go to is Wingstop.", "created_utc": 1587841052.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7z3qq/the_dumpster_fire_that_is_wingstop/", "is_self": true}
