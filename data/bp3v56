I will have about two months of nothing before I start my full time job. I would like to dip my toes into the robin hood options life, but I was looking for guidance on how to get started when the time comes. Can anybody suggest books on options trading or other strategies? I feel I am competent with reading financial statements, but what else goes into doing DD and how can I get some of those sweet tendies I read about in here? \n\nLastly, would $1000 be a realistic amount to begin trading with? I have money elsewhere, but I would only be comfortable with using this amount for options trading. Is this too small of an amount to play around with to actually flip it into profit? \n\n\nRegards,\nAn aspiring autist", "created_utc": 1557955766, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bp3v56/becoming_an_autist/", "is_self": true}
