Those are mostly boomers and older with plenty of wealth tied up in property. By fall that property will be up for sale. All at once, all over the country.

Joe-Schmoe who just saw half his savings go up in flames in the stock market? The only buyers are the cash-gang, those who wait at whatever bankruptcy-bottom-prices makes sense to them in order to make a killing of off the misery.\n\nWhat happens to interest rates?
