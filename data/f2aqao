That bitch is at ~$8 a share and some $10 calls in August cost $.34\n\nMy technical analysis is that $8+$2=$10 and I have roughly six months to get to that shit. How the FUCK can this piece of shit stock not go up by a couple dollars in the upcoming months. Also, they just did a deal with Tmobility or whatever the fuck that is, at least I think. Honestly, I forgot. I barely read the article but I think they did idk. Some fucking nerd can confirm this for me. I\u2019m mostly making that assumption off of some headline RH gave me that involved Sprint and the mobility bullshit that made $S shoot up by 70%.\n\nThe point is though, using simple PEMDAS, we can calculate that 8+2=10. We only need to at least hope it raises to $3 to cover our asses. Let\u2019s hope this shit company delivers some much needed tendies\n\nAnd to the retards that keep saying \u201cbuy puts lol\u201d literally no one knows what the fuck you\u2019re talking about.
