The stock is up 8% in Friday morning trading.\n\n\u201cUber is the global ridesharing leader and is becoming the global food delivery leader,\u201d wrote Mahaney, who said that Uber remains his top pick in the large-cap internet universe. He cut his price target on the stock to $59 from $64 while maintaining an outperform rating, but he still sees more than 50% upside for the shares with the reduced target.\n\nIn [**the latest quarterly numbers that came out Thursday afternoon**](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/uber-stock-turns-higher-on-narrower-than-expected-loss-2020-02-06), Mahaney liked that Uber\u2019s ride-hailing business saw improvements as the ride hailing industry as a whole becomes more \u201crational,\u201d meaning that players have limited their attempts to undercut one another with the sorts of pricing and big discounts that had at one time suggested the business might be a race to the bottom. Mahaney saw encouraging signs in Uber\u2019s pricing moves and talk about service segmentation.\n\nWhile Uber\u2019s 2020 revenue forecast came up a bit shy of the Wall Street consensus, the company projected a lower loss than analysts were expecting, giving signs of hope on a key metric that had been [**fueling unease for Uber investors**](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/uber-leaves-tantalizing-clues-about-ride-hailing-profits-but-stock-takes-a-hit-2019-08-09) since the company came public last May.\n\nUber\u2019s commentary around its outlook drew cheers from Bernstein\u2019s Mark Shmulik, who was encouraged that the company gave better disclosures. \u201cThe transparency from management was welcome, ambitious, and hammered home a message of profitable growth,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNow, all Uber needs to do is go an execute against these goalposts.\u201d\n\nShmulik acknowledged that there seems to be a \u201cwar\u201d going on between profitability and growth at Uber as the company manages the trade-offs.\n\n\u201cUber\u2019s guidance on the bottom-line was positive, and arguably necessary to build credibility with investors,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAt the same time, it seems to be coming at the expense of growth. With management conviction high on this strategy, and belief low-hanging fruit is there, all that\u2019s left is to go deliver.\u201d\n\nShmulik kept his outperform rating and $40 target price on the shares.\n\nUber got an upgrade from MKM Partners analyst Rohit Kulkarni, who said he sees \u201clight at the end of this tunnel\u201d given that has lately been valued by investors \u201cas if it is going out of business\u201d whereas now the company is sounding more serious about its profit goals.\n\n\u201cOver the past couple of quarters, Uber\u2019s incremental margins on Rides revenue upside have been &gt;70%, largely responsible for this acceleration in pathway to profitability,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe think this trendline is sustainable near-term, with potential for further upside if food delivery companies start acting like good stalwarts of capital.\u201d\n\nSusquehanna\u2019s Shyam Patil said that Uber seems to be \u201cmaking progress\u201d on profitability goals, but he\u2019s not ready to jump on the bull train just yet.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/uber-is-ready-to-join-the-fang-camp-analyst-says-after-earnings-2020-02-07](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/uber-is-ready-to-join-the-fang-camp-analyst-says-after-earnings-2020-02-07)", "created_utc": 1581091066, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f0ce4i/uber_is_ready_to_join_the_fang_camp_analyst_says/", "is_self": true}
