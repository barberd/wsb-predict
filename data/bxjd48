{"id": "bxjd48", "title": "My Second Options Buy Was ASuccess", "selftext": "You may know me by my previous post \"My First Substantial Options Buy Was A Success\" I gained about 4k (Would be closer to 8k if I held until today, but I've learned to not be greedy, so I'm a lot quicker to take profits than I used to be, and I'm totally fine with that). \n\nOnly just recently gotten into options. I'm liking them but I realize the bigger risk so only plan to use them in some situations. And I'll probably never do any same week or same day option plays like I see on here sometimes. I'll probably stick to 4 weeks minimum. \n\nAnyway yesterday I was still slightly below my day trader 25k limit  at previous close and was cash only with only $500 buying power. I was relieved to mostly be out of the market honestly to give myself a break (you guys probably know the feeling). But being the autist I am and since I'm addicted I wanted to try to find the opportunity for the highest return with low money. \n\nI settled on AMD calls for 3 weeks out. I could only buy 3 contracts. Woke up today and they got a gain of 60%. That's so far my highest gain percentage wise ever (the 4k I got was only about 30% gain). So it kinda sucks it's on so little money, but a gain is a gain. And honestly the AMD thing was a total gamble, something I don't normally do. And wouldn't have done with more than maybe 2-3k). It could have gone either way and has already banged its head on 30 price then dropped like 5 times. So nothing to say it wouldn't again, but I just felt its time had come because market sentiment has changed a bit this week.\n\nThis was a small time bet, something you usually won't see out of me. I was just limited that day. It's back to high rolling on Friday. I'm eyeing buying stocks in ADBE, TWLO (if it drops to high 120s), maybe a small position in JPM, I'm eyeing EA also but only if it drops to 92s. But my big bet that I might play next after analyzing my usual stocks is NFLX. I'm thinking some calls 4 weeks out at about 370 strike. I expect this to reach over 380 by then.", "created_utc": 1559841698, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bxjd48/my_second_options_buy_was_asuccess/", "is_self": true}
