{"id": "ekwwoz", "title": "Germany is killing autism", "selftext": "Germany, the country full of people who think work is superior to mindless gambling, but then wonder why their pensions are so small, essentially kills what this sub stands for. How, you ask?\n\nWell, our beloved Minister of Finance Olaf Scholz (who proudly admitted all his private money sits in a 0% interest bank account because everything else would be far too risky) really is determined to kill off trading. After he got backlash for his ideas to abolish the capital gains tax (to tax financial gains under the almost always higher personal income tax) and introduce a 0.2% tax on stock transactions (yes, just stocks, not derivatives, because he is dumb), now actually managed to slip something into a law that no one seemed to notice.\n\nActive from 2021, the maximum loss from derivatives you can deduct from your taxes will be 10.000 EUR. I know, I know, taxes and shit is too complicated fo you guys here. So I will give you an example.\n\nSuppose its January 2019, TSLA is at 300$, and you bought 420$ TSLA Calls expiring in August for 50.000 EUR, because you believe in mighty Elon and he surely won't fail you. Except he does, and as a true bagholder you clinch to the sunken ship until it hits the ground, and all your money is gone. You post your losses here and everyone calls you a True Hero, so you can somehow live with it, but you swear you will never gamble like this again. Except two months later with TSLA at 220$ you do it anyway and throw the 10.000 EUR you have left at Calls again. You watch the stock rise and rise and rightfully think you are the goddamn smartest person to ever have existed on earth. You cash out and celebrate that you came back and now have 70.000 EUR. \n\nNow its tax season and you expect to pay 25% capital gains tax on your gains, which surely should be 0.25\\*(-50.000+60.000) = 2.500. So instead of 60.000 EUR you now have 67.500 EUR, paid 2500 EUR in taxes and everyone is happy, right?\n\nExcept with this law change the losses you can deduct per year are now kept at 10.000 EUR. That means you pay 0.25\\*(-10.000+60.000) = 12.500 EUR in taxes and are left with...57.500 EUR? Less than you started with? You are telling me I just risked 60.000 EUR to make 10.000 EUR and then the taxes I have to pay on that are bigger than my gains?\n\nYep, thats entirely correct.", "created_utc": 1578330400, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ekwwoz/germany_is_killing_autism/", "is_self": true}
