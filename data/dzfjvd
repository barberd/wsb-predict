{"id": "dzfjvd", "title": "CMG vs DPZ", "selftext": "It's all time epic stoner battle food battle. Chipotle and Dominos Pizza.  \nChipotle's tremendous revenue growth rate (13.9%) has garnered a significant premium versus other competitors in the quick serve industry. - DPZ (4.7%)  \nDominoes Pizza is one competitor that has shows eerily similar financial profile compared to Chipotle. Similar EBITDA, FCF, and more efficient management ratios. EPS DPZ: 9.06x, CMG: 12.93x. CMG is currently trading at a roughly 56 P/E compared to DPZ's 30 P/E.  \n\n\nGranted this has not taken into consider any traditional retail food service metrics.... but....  \nEither two things will happen as a result of these discrepancies... CMG's revenue and earnings will slow due to improper management or overreaching to maintain such a staggering growth rate or.... DPZ will continue to lose market share due to CMG's new delivery offerings and perceived healthier food offerings.", "created_utc": 1574319876, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dzfjvd/cmg_vs_dpz/", "is_self": true}
