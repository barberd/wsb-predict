Shit, they even *look* like snakeoil salesmen. Or a circus act. \n\n*Here ye here ye, we have the AMAZING TWIN BROTHERS who look like persian warlords. They have access to the spirits and they will tell you how to make money. Just make sure you buy what they recommend or you will be stuck a poor peasant!*", "created_utc": 1566493093, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cu085r/the_najarian_brothers_aka_the_barnum_brothers/", "is_self": true}
