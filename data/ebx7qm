{"id": "ebx7qm", "title": "EEM Corporate Action (and why Robinhood still sucks)", "selftext": "I had $44p Jan20 contracts on EEM.  Woke up to a note from RH that a) my GTC order had been canceled and b) that my \" EEM options were recently adjusted due to a special action on their underlying equity.\"  The adjustment is that my strike was moved down to $43.73 (?!) and the contract is currently untradable\\*.  So I went to iShares to see if I could figure out what's up, and there is a big flag at the top of the EEM page that says \"***Notice Regarding Special Distributions:*** *On Dec. 13, 2019, iShares announced special distributions related to income received from non-recurring corporate actions that will be paid on Dec.16, 2019. This fund\u2019s special distribution is related to Naspers Ltd.\u2019s spinoff of Prosus NV.\"* So that seems like it's the sort of thing that I probably should've gotten a notice about, right...?  Well, yeah.  It's Robinhood.  \n\nSo I dug a little deeper, and yes indeed, it went ex-dividend yesterday, and will pay out $0.93 on Dec-20.  What I can't wrap my head around is why my strike got marked down to $43.73.  And sure enough, if you look at the chain, all of the options are at weird strikes now (ending in .73 or .23).  So every ITM put contract lost $27 in intrinsic, and every ITM call contract gained $27 intrinsic, right? \n\nAnyone ever seen this before and/or can anyone explain to me the logic of this? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*contract is now tradable at it's new lower strike as of about 10:30 EST.", "created_utc": 1576596519, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ebx7qm/eem_corporate_action_and_why_robinhood_still_sucks/", "is_self": true}
