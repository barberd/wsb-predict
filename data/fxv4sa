Many of you feel that something is rigged in the general economy.  Our wages have been stagnant since the 70's.  We exported all the good jobs.  This whole last decade of gains have just been debt games and derivatives.  Our whole economy is a crazy jenga game of interlocking debt, mortgaged to infinity at zero percent interest rates.\n\nOur whole retirement system and whole standard of life has been tied to the stock market.  All the 401K's, etc.  Everything has been pegged to the market.  THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT ALLOW IT TO FAIL.  If the stock market fails, the government fails.  People rioting in the street and stuff.  Their back is to the wall.  They must kick this can further down the road or else they implode.\n\nSo the Fed MUST print all the money to keep the market from collapsing.  They must cover all the record bad debts.  They must.  The problem isn't the Corona Virus.  The problem is the debt  bubble we've built up over the last decade of zero percent interest.  A record level of debt across all sectors, consumer, corporate and government.  \n\nThe Fed must print money and they must continue to print money for a long time.  The Fed balance sheet will be $14T and the national debt will be $30T before we start to level out.  Knowing this, how do you make money?  Make the Fed printer your friend.  Buy leap calls on gold mining stocks.  GOLD, AUY, NEM, AEM, KL.... whatever.... GDX, GDXJ..... but buy then for Jan 2022.  This will take a long time to play out.  Don't go for the leveraged etf's.  They decay.  You don't want to hold them long term.  \n\nIn Fed Printer We Trust.\n\nAlso, look up the London Gold Pool.  The people who print the money also manipulate the price of gold to suppress it.  Sometimes, people demand physical gold and this manipulation breaks down.  Then the price of gold spikes hard.  Pray for that to happen again and cash in on it.", "created_utc": 1586448506.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxv4sa/buy_leap_calls_on_gold_mining_stocks/", "is_self": true}
