{"id": "f11gbi", "title": "New to options and I can't understand how this could possibly work", "selftext": "So according to optionsprofitcalculator.com which according to alot of people is pretty accurate, if I buy 5/15 PLT calls I can sell them for profit whenever PLT stock is at 13.17 or above. It's at 15.04 currently so this has to bullshit but I can't figure out why. The calculations seem accurate (sell '5/15 22.50' calls at 0.77 per option for $77-$72 entry cost ($5 profit) even though the stock literally dropped 13%. Is there something I'm not understanding/taking into account? Also what's stopping me from closing an option as soon as the stock goes up?", "created_utc": 1581212237, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f11gbi/new_to_options_and_i_cant_understand_how_this/", "is_self": true}
