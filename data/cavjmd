Yeah, I know the \u201cbad bank\u201d fails,  but [these](https://www.forbes.com/sites/francescoppola/2015/03/02/what-do-you-do-when-a-bad-bank-fails/#7c30f24c55ee) are not really banks and they don\u2019t really \u201cfail\u201d.  They do what they were created to do - sell off assets.  Meanwhile, if history is any guide, assuming markets believe depositors will be protected (the alternative being a run), the good bank survives (Mellon, Citi, BOA).  Fuck, it turns out this is totally a thing in Europe and good banks have survived for years in places like Sweden, Germany, Spain, France, Austria, the Baltics and the UK.  That\u2019s some new shit I learned today.  Except for the Baltics part.  I just copied that.  I don\u2019t know what that is.\n\nSo here\u2019s my point:  DB has been openly fucked up for, like, ever.  They have had plenty of time to fail or be let failed and yet they have never managed to successfully fail.  So why all the hate today?  Banks are confusing to me, but how does this not end well?", "created_utc": 1562644073, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cavjmd/good_bad_banks/", "is_self": true}
