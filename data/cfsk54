{"id": "cfsk54", "title": "$125/month investment for potential $2,000,000 gains?", "selftext": "Last night, I was taking a hot shower and had some shower thoughts, and got this breakthrough idea which might be able to help me offset -$56k losses that have occurred to me in the past few years since 2012. (Not my fault. You know that the market has been difficult for past 7 years).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRight after the shower, I started looking at the term-life insurance products and their rates and learned that life insurances are surprisingly cheap. Did you know that it only costs around $50\\~60/month to get a 30-year term life insurance of $1 million?  Yes, you heard it right. $1,000,000 for only $50/month. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't stop my research there, and I adjusted a few input criteria to increase my potential profit, and I was able to get the rate of $125/month for 30-year term life insurance for $2 million. I suspect that the rate is probably very good because I am not a tobacco user, I don't drink, and am very healthy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, using $125/month and $2,000,000 return as a basis, I decided to calculate a few exit options to get potential profit %.\n\nFor example, if I die right after I pay for the first-month payment of $125, I will get $2,000,000 in return. That would be whooping  16000+ times (aka 1600000%) return on investments. \n\nIf I die after 20 years of investment, ($30000 payments total over 20 years), I will get $2,000,000 and that is still 60+ times return on investment. \n\nBelow is the table for those of you who are data-oriented investors&amp;strategists.\n\n|When I die in|Payments made|Profit|Profit %|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1 month|$125|$2,000,000|1600000%|\n|12 months (1 year)|$1500|$2,000,000|133333%|\n|240 months (20 years)|$30000|$2,000,000|6666%|\n|300 months (25 years)|$37500|$2,000,000|5333%|\n\nSo, in terms of profit %, dying after 25 years of payment is not that bad and is still great... but dying as soon as possible, preferably only after a month of payment will maximize the profit %.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce I get $2M in return, I can pay off my car loans &amp; CC debts, subscribe to Netflix/HBO/Hulu at the same time, and most importantly, I don't have to deal with banks rejecting my mortgage applications any more due to my low income. I will be able to buy a house with 100% offer. \n\nI am thinking of owning one in southern California and one in Asia, so I have already shifted my research time more on learning good house interiors &amp; DIY home improvements, and less on stock markets. \n\nAlso, I will no longer need to pay rents after I buy the house which is just a free side benefit that comes with becoming a homeowner. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere might be some tax implications for $2M earnings which I haven't researched yet, but I think it won't be a problem so much since I will have so much money in my hand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am thinking of closing my brokerage account soon, and start investing using this strategy. I usually spend around $2000+ dollars on executing trades alone per year (My brokerage charges you \\~$5 per trade). So I should not have a problem paying for $125/month if I use this strategy. I still have plenty of credits left in my CCs and can probably ask my family members to co-sign loans for monthly insurance payments, although I don't think that will be necessary.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis strategy is kinda fail-proof and you can't go tits up, because life insurance companies that I researched for the quote above have ratings above A+, (for those of you who don't know, company ratings are very important factor in life insurance domain, and companies with A or higher ratings don't usually go south, and have been there for more than 50\\~100+ years), so I don't have to worry about them going down, where typical biotech companies disappear overnight, and many companies have short lifespan.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThoughts? Questions? If you want to follow my strategy and have questions, let me know!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*P.S. By the way, I am talking about term-life insurance here, not the whole-life insurance which is way too expensive and nonsense. (They cost like $1000\\~$1200/month), so I don't think they are worth it. I don't even see much difference between those two either.*", "created_utc": 1563666276, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cfsk54/125month_investment_for_potential_2000000_gains/", "is_self": true}
