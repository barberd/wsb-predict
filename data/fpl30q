It means pregnant women will be giving birth at home. But why does this fucking matter?\n\nWell as you can see by my username, this is my area of expertise. McKesson is a HUGE supplier of scalpels used specifically for circumcision.\n\nSince people will be giving birth in their homes like they do in the fuckin jungle, circumcisions will be on a sharp decline.\n\nIt means McKesson will be fucked with all these extra scalpels and no foreskin around to be removed.\n\nThis is where I, the smegmatrader, will get to go to tendie town as there will be a sharp excess of available smegma for my research purposes. \n\nFeel free to come to tendie town with me.\n\n5/1 $100P", "created_utc": 1585261484.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpl30q/puts_on_mckesson_mck_technical_analysis_inside/", "is_self": true}
