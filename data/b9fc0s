{"id": "b9fc0s", "title": "BTFD?", "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\nI am just curious. What is the overall opinion about US equities at their current levels? 3 years ago, people were laughing when somebody mentioned Dow 25k. Does technical or fundamental analysis actually work? We are quite close to the ATH on all US indexes. When you compare hard/soft data from September and now, the difference is huge. I am starting to believe that the only way to analyze the market is to take into consideration a few things:\n\nModern money mechanics , debt=money and money=debt. The only way to keep Capitalism alive is through money creation, that is clear.\n\nSo, if you`re betting against the US economy, you are virtually betting that Capitalism will vanish.\n\n\nThis boggles me a lot. People thought 2009 was the end. From the current point of view, 2009 was the best time to buy. Now, I believe a drop is what follows, but could there be a chance for DOW at 30k?  \n\n", "created_utc": 1554397164, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b9fc0s/btfd/", "is_self": true}
