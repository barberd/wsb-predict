Oil prices plummet? Nope, another Green Day for NRGU. \n\nDon\u2019t hold ETF\u2019s or in this case, ETN\u2019s for long yada yada yada. But is the risk worth more than the reward?\n\nYa see, NRGU tracks the top 10 companies in the energy/ oil sector and claims to provide 3x leveraged returns. Some of these companies include:\nXOM\nOXY\nMPC\nCVX\nAnd a few more.\n\nWith a 52w high of $55.19 I can\u2019t help but to want to yolo on this ETN. \n\nWhat\u2019re your thoughts? Am I as dumb as my fifth grade teacher told me I\u2019d always be or am I on to something?\n\nOh, and stop wasting your damn money on USO.", "created_utc": 1588101367.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9tirn/nrgu_incompetent_or_genius/", "is_self": true}
