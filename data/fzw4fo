I hope you're enjoying a bright and happy Easter morning wherever you are. It's espresso hour at Casa de Fuzzy, and what better way to spend it than shouting into the r/wallstreetbets void. My followers got this one last night after automod spiked it here but I'm trying again this morning. \n\nToday is going to be an uncharacteristically short post but I think it's an important one. I have noticed a lot of misinformation floating around the sub on the topic of Fed's so-called junk bond purchases. Normally I'm happy to let you dummies flail around in the dark but I've spent a fair chunk of time over the last two days going over the [term sheet](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/monetary20200409a2.pdf) and frankly the number of you who are not just getting it wrong but getting it flat-earth / anti-vax / Epstein killed himself / u/pokimane shouldn't be a mod level of wrong is starting to reach critical mass, so I'm going to step in.\n\nSo. Here is a *Fun! With Finance: With Fuzzy* breakdown of what the term sheet actually permits the Fed to do. Disclaimer: This is a term sheet only, not a definitive agreement - the reality may change and honestly with this administration it probably will, but this is what we have to go on for now, so it will have to do. Ready? Here we go.  Questions permitted in the comments as always.\n\n1. The Fed **is not** authorizing the blanket purchase of junk debt (HY cash bonds) - it is authorizing the purchase of select HY ETFs. So sorry, little autist, but whatever shit company leveraged to the tits with bond debt you've got calls on probably won't be getting a short term cash injection.\n2. However, the Fed **is** authorizing the purchase of bonds from eligible investment grade issuers **or** issuers who were investment grade as of 3/22 but are no longer - key names here are $F, $OCC, $M, $CLR and $WES. Obviously the reason for this is $F. Many commenters [in my post on $F](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqk15o/fallen_angels_shitty_cars_worse_debt_and_what_it/) speculated on how the Fed might bail them out so well done to those of you who played along at home.\n3. The Fed **will** purchase these eligible bonds at FMV - not at a discount.\n4. The Fed will **not** purchase shares in HY ETFs that are trading above the NAV (net asset value) of the components of the relevant fund. This goes hand in hand with the subcap on ETF investment mentioned below to indicate that ETFs are not the priority here. $HYG will bounce a little, but not a lot.\n5. The Fed purchase of HY bonds or HY ETFS is subject to several caps and limitations - (i) 20% of a HY ETF's oustanding shares (ii) 10% of an eligible issuer's outstanding bonds and (iii) 1.5% of the total facility size per individual issuer.\n6. No banks or financial institutions are eligible for the program.\n\nThere you have it. What does this mean? My take is that the total commitment of the facility **as of today** is less than 1% of the US HY debt market (it obviously could grow significantly). Your faithful correspondent thinks that as of right now, this is a targeted strike on particular entities to avoid the need for politically sensitive terms like 'bailout'.\n\nCovenant breakdowns for $LULU and $LYV and an EBITDA primer drop on r/wallstreetbets this week.", "created_utc": 1586695581.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fzw4fo/fuzzys_fed_facts_a_short_mythbuster_about_jpows/", "is_self": true}
