All the companies, redfin, opendoor, Ibuyhomes, etc... that buy peoples homes are going to cause a huge housing market crash.\n\nFirst Stage:\n\nIn the mortgage business, we are seeing interest rates actually going up right now. But we are also not going to be able to provide loans to any new buyers or anyone looking to purchase a home, THAT CANT WORK FROM HOME.  This means if you work in construction or anyone who has to be at work, you aren't gonna be able to buy a house.  This means a lack in demand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecond Stage:\n\nAll these companies that buy houses are going to realize they can no longer sell these houses for top dollar and are going to unload them like the company in Margin Call did out of fear of bankruptcy. (Lower prices quickly). They are basically bagholders\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThird Stage: \n\nMass boomer panic out of fear of 2008 crisis\n\nFourth Stage: \n\nStupid people profit on the way down, smart people profit on the way up. We buy the cheap houses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLemme know what you think of my DD and if I make you money, great.", "created_utc": 1584050729.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fholfc/massive_housing_market_crash_coming_next/", "is_self": true}
