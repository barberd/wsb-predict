{"id": "f0c1gs", "title": "Need Advice on Investing", "selftext": "So i am a student, like many others that have student debt in Canada. I am starting to pay off my outstanding debt little by little. \n\nI was told by a family member who is the VP at RBC dominian services that the best thing to do would be to pay off the debt with the minimum payment and invest another minimum payment of 500$ to a TFSA (PH&amp;N global equity fund) \n\nDo people have any experience in this equity fund? is there a good return year over year? \n\nI will be investing for 5 years, by the end of the 5th year i will be taking the money that has accumulated and pay off lump sum to my debt. \n\nLet me know what people think. I am not the best at this and would love some feedback!", "created_utc": 1581089568, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f0c1gs/need_advice_on_investing/", "is_self": true}
