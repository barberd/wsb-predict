I like those deals and have their commons/warrants. But everyone is sleeping on the best deal yet.\n\n\\#1) We know the biggest upside with SPACs lies in the potential rise of the warrants. Guess what \u2013 the biggest downside exists with warrants as well. If the deal falls through ( see [TJ Fridays SPAC deal](https://www.franchisetimes.com/news/April-2020/TGI-Fridays-SPAC-Merger-Terminated/) that disintegrated in April) the warrants become worthless.\n\n\\#2) We have yet to see financials on OPES. FMCI\u2019s deal is based on 2021 estimated EBITDA of 15.6x. GPAQ has yet to be profitable. \n\nBy way of comparison, let\u2019s take a look at the ACTT/Whole Earth Brands transaction:\n\n\\#1) The ACTT deal is going to close [by the end of June](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200616005595/en/Act-II-Global-Acquisition-Corp.-Amends-Terms). So the primary deal risk \u2013 warrants becoming worthless is essentially out of the question.  The same cannot be said for the other deals such as OPES, FMCI which are in their earlier stages of the transaction.\n\n\\#2) On June 16, the parties announced that the ACTT deal has been recut a 2nd time, and the assumed enterprise value (i.e the cost to purchase for SPAC holders) has been further reduced from $516M to $439M. Using 2020 Pro-Forma Adjusted EBITDA of $65M (Investor deck pg. 44) , that results in a Enterprise value (EV)/EBITDA multiple of 6.75x. Even more impressive is that the EV/Estimated Free Cash Flow (FCF) 2020 multiple is 7.67x. I come to this figure based on the disclosure in the investment deck that the original EV of $516M was 9.0x FCF (investor deck, page 44) which means FCF is approximately $57.33M. At an EV of $439M, that is 7.67x of FCF.\n\nSo in a down COVID year, this business are generating $57M and you only need to pay a 7.67x. Compare that to other companies in the food and beverage consumer products who have a multiple of 14.3x FCF and companies in the ingredients business trading at a multiple of 22.7x of FCF. (all on page 44).\n\n\\#3) Based on the latest deal, announced on June 16, the anticipated leverage will be 0.8x. This means that Whole Earth Brands will have a strong balance sheet and being able to grow organically and acrretively. If you know the history of the Irwin Simon, who will be the executive chairman of Whole Earth Brands \u2013 he is a deal-maker. He founded Hain Pure Foods in 1993 and grew it from stock trading at $1 in 1994 to $67 at its peak in 2015. He did that primarily by executing 55 M&A deals and acquiring the Companies that make well known products such as celestial seasons tea, almond dream and rice dream milk, terra chips and a ton of other organic and all natural products.\n\nSummary:\n\nACTT warrants have minimal risk. The Company is being sold at a cheap multiple. It is a $20 stock easily. The Chairman has experience building up companies in this space- Hain Celestial. Whole Earth has a balance sheet with minimal debt and already has several deals in the works to start acquiring companies after the merger which is expected by the end of June. \n\nWhole Earth already has established brands in the sugar replacement industry \u2013 Equal, Pure Via and Canderel.\n\nBest things about the warrants \u2013 they are good for five years. So even if it takes the Company some time to start moving, you have a time horizon of five years to see those 500% returns from the warrants.", "created_utc": 1592407555.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hatbew/does_anywhere_here_want_to_make_money_actt_now/", "is_self": true}
