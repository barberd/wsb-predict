The stock market has been my sole focus all day everyday since January of this year. This is my first vacation while being so heavily involved in the merket. I never would\u2019ve agreed to the terms but my fiance would\u2019ve just taken her boyfriend, and I hate that guy. \n\nI started outperforming him in recent months, hence the engagement (6.2k on a fucking ring and she\u2019s still fucking him when mad at me?) and now I\u2019m feeling not so well. Friday at EOD I entered the position of  100 SPY 307c 6/29 @ avg of .25 each, 2500 that came from SPY puts earlier this week. \n\nWe hit the road a little while ago and are on the way to Gatlinburg, should be there around 8 am then we are doing a few trails equaling 18 miles of hiking. Clearly I need to be around service at market open.. \n\nI was looking at the futures just now and started  thinking of possible exit plans. Should I be proactive and email my broker a delightfully worded email asap? Just laying out that this was all a big whoopsie and that my nephew when visiting last week clearly snuck into my office and tinkered with things. I also am in an investing group with 10 close friends and in total we have around 2 mil total portfolio value, should I say we will take our money elsewhere? I doubt my group would even consider doing that but even the threat could work. \n\n\nTL:DR: SPY money disappear fast, remit all personal contractual responsiblities YOLO", "created_utc": 1593409104.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hhu6b9/whats_going_to_happen/", "is_self": true}
