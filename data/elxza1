It doesn't matter if you lose dollar after dollar, you'll get the timing down eventually. Keep selling those calls, keep buying those puts, it'll come, I'm sure of it. Papa Buffet always says, \"Be greedy when others are cautious, be cautious when others are greedy.\" In light of that fact this sudden rise and the rhetoric assault of bulls is only *more* evidence of the coming recession, so double down, take out a second mortgage on the house, and tendies will surely fall like Mana from heaven. It's only a matter of time after all. Do not give up hope you brilliant autists.\n\nBEARS DO NOT READ BEYOND THIS POINT IT IS ONLY FOR BULLS\n\nBULLS.\n\nTo bulls: Be careful to shit on bears, because who do you think is on the loosing side of all those trades you do? Do you get it now? Your tendies would be meager and scrawny if it weren't for some autist who just watched *The Big Short* assured he could time the market better than billionaire hedge fund managers who employee dozens of PhDs! They keep calls coming in *cheaply* and sell them to you with a *smile* on their face, they buy the puts you sell while laughing gleefully, deepening your pockets while lessening theirs. They're *happy* to lose money to you! Give them encouragement and our tendies will grow, but with each chip you tear from their morale your costs increase and your tendies shrink. In order to make the almighty tendies, you can't let them lose hope.\n\nSigned,\n\n-An autist\n\nPS: Theta gang, keep fucking over everyone, brilliant.", "created_utc": 1578513780, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/elxza1/an_open_letter_to_bears_and_bulls/", "is_self": true}
