They decided to stop making shitbox econocars and sedans that don't sell and are focusing on their trucks, SUV's, and the Stang - all things that sell. These are also categories that foreign manufacturers are not strong in = less competition.\n\n2. Ford seems to be developing a hybrid gas-electric F150. I think this could be yuge.\n\n3. Ford has had huge success with it's Ecoboost engines, especially in their trucks. Competitors like Dodge and Chevy are not their yet with their V6/turbo offerings for light duty trucks.\n\n4. Stock has been stagnant for a long time and I think any positive news will send it to the moon. I'm hoping that optimism around the focus on profitable categories sends it to the moon.\n\n5. Some analyst rating summary on Robinhood tells me that the CEO is into cutting bureaucracy and I'm down with that.", "created_utc": 1557287607, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bm0l4t/anyone_bullish_on_ford/", "is_self": true}
