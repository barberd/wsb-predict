{"id": "gijbux", "title": "DD on exercising and fitness", "selftext": "I've been lurking in this sub for awhile and thought I should post some potentially decent ~~gambles~~ calls that I've made recently. So I'm gonna get to the point because, from what I've read, most of you don't know how to read.\n\n$FIT $9c August 21\n\n$WW $30c July 17\n\nNow for those that wanna know more and aren't blindly tossing their portfolios into calls and seeing what sticks...lets begin:\n\n(Also because I do want to bore you, I'll be putting important sentences in bold so you can read it without *actually* reading it.)\n\n**Who's seen huge groups of families out walking together or at least seen a lot more people on the street riding their bikes?**\n\nI live in a very white neighborhood so around **4:30PM you'll see a shitload of foot traffic** appear out of nowhere because everyone just got off work and wants to get some \"fresh air.\" In the early weeks of quarantine I predicted that these people would eventually get tired of their walks and find something better to do. But like all my other predictions, I was incorrect. These people have continued their walks. On top of that, I'm seeing them **outfitted with headbands and watches** now. These are the same people I've been *watching* for the past two months through my [front room window](https://youtu.be/Yzht2_41caU?t=133). I'd like to say Nike would be a good move but I'm still unsure. **I would, however, say something like FitBit**. **A lot of these middle aged people who are taking their kids on walks know they can't run miles on miles but love to see how many** ***steps*** **they're doing per day.**\n\n\"*OOOOH Timothy, honey, guess how many steps I did today?!\"*\n\nWhat tracks steps? A FitBit. My guess **is that eventually when things begin to normalize, we will see a lot of people migrate towards fitness.** According to some [schmucks that track shit](https://jamesclear.com/new-habit), **it takes around 60 days to develop a new habit**. We're nearing the 60 day mark for a lot of these state lock downs. That being said, there could potentially be loads of people with their newfound love for at-home fitness and tracking their steps, moving towards alternatives such as Weight Watchers and Planet Fitness in the coming months as things open.\n\nIf you're still not sold on FitBit for the reason that more people could potentially buy them in the future because of new habits, then at least look into what they've been doing. [FitBit's new Charge 4 has built-in GPS and other bells and whistles that could drive people towards the product.](https://cnet.com/news/fitbit-charge-4-review-gps-sleep-tracking-plus-its-pretty/) They're also paving the way for health-tracking technology and even going as far to [seek FDA clearance for AFib Detection](https://gizmodo.com/fitbit-plans-to-seek-fda-clearance-for-afib-detection-w-1843273948).\n\nI would even wager to say that Weight Watchers could move sooner than expected. Reason for this is that people are trying to [combat weight gain](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/30/health/combat-weight-gain-quarantine-coronavirus-wellness/index.html) because a lot of people are eating their quarantine snacks before they can even get home from the store. So what can these people do if they can't afford treadmills (or they're all sold out)? I believe they'll head to Weight Watchers.\n\n>With the kitchen now just steps away from many new home offices, some are worried about the \u201cquarantine 15,\u201d the extra few pounds that may be gained while being stuck at home stress-eating with no access to the local gym in an effort to help slow the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\\[[2](https://spectrumlocalnews.com/tx/san-antonio/news/2020/04/20/how-to-avoid-the--quarantine-15-)\\]\n\nFor those that got this far, thank you for being an intellectual. I\u2019m truly hoping this bet will get me out of the shitty $SAVE and $LOGI calls I made.\n\n**Sources**:\n\nPersonal Encounters - I've talked with a lot of people (coworkers, neighbors, friends etc) and they're getting into fitness. These are people that didn't work out before.\n\n**Decent Proof:**\n\n[There's people holding Zoom fitness sessions](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/05/9763639/zoom-workout)\n\n[Peloton's earnings are fat](https://www.bicycling.com/news/a32438628/peloton-revenue-membership-surge-third-quarter-2020/) because everyone's buying fitness machines. Granted these are people that need an alternative for gyms but some non-gym rats might be the cause for this as well.\n\nThere's loads of articles that are talking about self-care and bettering yourself with exercise.
