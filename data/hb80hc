{"id": "hb80hc", "title": "[Chart] Voodoo & [Options] Chains - $HD and $SPOT", "selftext": "Hey Retards,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore I begin, I would like to apologize for the long break. I have been busy with work, being quarantined, and chasing hot chicks that already have boyfriends. If you've read my posts before then you already know the deal - we like to mess with dark voodoo and chains here. I'm talking chart voodoo and options chains, of course.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOkay so on the menu today we have Home Depot ($HD) and Spotify ($SPOT). These stonks are 180's from each other and have both performed exceptionally well YTD. If you held equity in these since March you would have reaped the tendies, but lets see if we can print some tendies playing options.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's start with the American classic: **$HD**.\n\n[1 year chart](https://preview.redd.it/dojt2x7ygl551.png?width=769&format=png&auto=webp&s=947ae970619327f0f2b5efac8b14d411b72d3376)\n\n[3 month chart](https://preview.redd.it/p4qkqgp3hl551.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=67349f6df5a6781ceb0bb5d40ea3eb33efbe5dee)\n\nO.K. so take a peak at that chart. That's a bullish flag right there you autists. We have a sharp rise in price (when the market recovered from the BIG GAY) and then a tight rising trading channel. The price fell below the trend line and is now struggling to break above intermediate term resistance levels of $250.\n\nRSI is trending towards the overbought realm, and MACD is signaling a bearish trend, although it is a weak indicator. EPS in recent quarters has been between $2-$3, lets see if they can do it again.\n\nOptions chains are pricing a $15/$13 upside/downside move after ER.\n\nI'm going to watch the volume on $HD throughout the rest of the week, but my plan here is a horizontal spread:\n\nSell the 7/17 255c and buy the 8/21 255c. The front month will expire worthless - and well before earnings - as the price of $HD hovers right above resistance levels. The idea is that IV will spike as we get closer to ER and the value of the back month option will spike with it. Sell the long leg for straight profit. Gravy. Tendies.\n\nPros: Take advantage of theta, $HD is a strong player, relatively cheap cost\n\nCons: If price moves too fast in either direction I will lose\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHome Improvement wasn't your favorite T.V. show? No problem. Let's talk **$SPOT**:\n\n[YTD chart](https://preview.redd.it/ottqpuqqkl551.png?width=759&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8f9b469c17c7f8d05db94871bf682c0dc3c659b)\n\n[3 mo chart](https://preview.redd.it/od9m6fjskl551.png?width=762&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fd37100a304494a214c553ff9e51e41dc7242ef)\n\nIf you aren't a total retard then you see what I see... That's right! Another bullish flag. Coronavirus hit the world and $SPOT said to the God of Death, \"Not today.\" Honestly, if you look at that graph it really wasn't hurt too much when the market tanked.\n\nWhat is there to say about $SPOT? The technicals are a mixed signal. The chart is forecasting that the stock could moon. RSI and MACD are signaling that the stock is overbought and may flip trend.\n\nIf we forget about that, though, $SPOT has hit ATHs in 2020 with relatively high trading volume in recent weeks (especially today). $SPOT recently signed podcast deals with Joe \"have you ever smoked DMT through your asshole\" Rogan and Kim Kardashian. Spotify has stiff competition from giants like Apple, Amazon and Google.\n\nThe options chain is pricing a $11.50 movement on both sides on the 7/17 expiry. Note, this is before the ER.\n\nTo be honest, when it comes to $SPOT I like the product but I don't love the stock. My recommendation here? I'm thinking cheap FDs or really wide debit spreads:\n\n$SPOT is breaching resistance levels and possibly confirming a bullish trend. This stock could rocket. I'm going to watch price action for momentum continuation and then pick up some 7/17 220c or 230c. These are so cheap and have high volume and open interest. The 210c is more likely to hit, but I want FDs here to take advantage of the IV before earnings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR\n\n$HD horizontal spread - sell the 7/17 255c and buy the 8/21 255c.\n\n$SPOT cheap calls - get some FDs 7/17 220c or 230c\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet me know what you think.", "created_utc": 1592456345.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hb80hc/chart_voodoo_options_chains_hd_and_spot/", "is_self": true}
