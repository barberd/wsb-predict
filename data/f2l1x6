I found out today (after 4 years) that it was a mistake and it's up about 100% but I'm angry at the same time because I know I would have made a lot more money if it was Harry Potter.\n\nI've been a Harry Potter fan since childhood and I continue to believe the series will sell a lot of books and movies for many years to come. Perhaps even remakes. Also I saw the HP books have sold more than the Holy Bible itself (wow).\n\nAnyway as the title says how do I buy stocks in Harry Potter, and maybe I need to find a different broker if TD America Trade doesn't sell it?", "created_utc": 1581479640, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f2l1x6/broker_accidentally_gave_me_wrong_shares_up_100/", "is_self": true}
