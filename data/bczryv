{"id": "bczryv", "title": "PCG: \"Strike Force\" (jesus christ) Report", "selftext": "PCG has maintained its absurd trend upward since becoming bankrupt. Anyone with a bit of sense has bowed out of this piece of shit stock. Still I thought it worth looking at the material elements of the [wildfire report](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/5836795/Newsom-s-Wildfire-and-Climate-Change-Report.pdf) released April 12th that saw the stock break $20 a share and soar up to $23. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Overview:**\n-\nFirst what seems to be lost here is this report is focused on the state's problem of wildfires in general, not specifically rescuing PGE although they are undoubtedly the impetus. Undoubtedly due to [threat to other utilities from credit ratings agencies.](https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-downgrades-Edison-International-to-Baa3-and-Southern-California-Edison--PR_396014) Second, despite the stock movements, when the report does address PGE it's entirely negative. Having read the report in its entirety I have hard time believing the trades being made were based on its contents. Third there is no attribution of authorship; whatever supposed experts wrote this report they decided not to include their names or credentials (substantial portions of the document can be found in newspaper articles). In reality this is a political document, it is a public relations piece. There are no real numbers beyond spending on existing programs or costs already incurred. There are no projections on rates, risks of future wildfire costs, no estimates on costs of borrowing, and a lot of feel good platitude objectives that are incompatible e.g. impotently invoking the feds to act. There are a significant number of costly proposals with time-spans on the order of years and very few concrete funding options.\n\nThere is no news in this report. It has no hard cost calculations or proposals. It's policy considerations have already been discussed in more detail from other sources. It's also severely lacking in relevant developments. For example there is no reference to a [recent memo](https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/California-electricity-rates-could-surge-50-13757757.php) which projected rate increases of up to 50% for PGE customers to cover their current BK liabilities.\n\n**Green Energy at Odds With PGE:**\n-\nOf the five parts the second concerns green energy, which PGE is trying to give a haircut in bankruptcy court by renegotiating purchase power agreements (PPAs). The PPAs are enormously important as the market CA set up following the first PGE BK was designed around these agreements. Green energy was a risky venture then and providers need assurances they could recoup their capital costs. It gets more complicated the further you dig. Right now the state of California's [generation capacity is well beyond demand](https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-fi-electricity-capacity/), in part fueled by investing in green technologies intended to supplant traditional methods. PGE makes money by generation and transmission, as generation and consumption (rising energy efficiency) takes hits it has to fall back on transmission capacity which is where the liabilities for fire risk reside. Green energy is at odds with PGE's traditional model: put panels on your roof or buy LED light bulbs, energy efficient washing machines? Now you're not buying energy from PGE they banked on, but you still need them in case you don't have energy generation that day *and* they have to keep their now less profitable transmission infrastructure from starting fires. They have to provide energy even as their revenue is eroded. The report allegedly written by experts avoids entirely these thorny issues and related conflicts. \n\nIt is possible this could be made up by [other green initiatives](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/brattle-electrification-could-drive-600b-in-transmission-spending-by-2050/550010/), but it poses problems by how this all plays out. EVs won't be a big enough market share to offset declining residential consumption for years.\n\n**Three \"concepts\" are proposed to deal with wildfire costs/liabilities:**\n-\n1. **Concept1: Liquidity-Only Fund.** This concept would create a fund to provide liquidity for utilities to pay wildfire damage claims pending CPUC determination of Wildfires and Climate Change: California\u2019s Energy Future whether or not those claims are appropriate for cost recovery and may be coupled with modification of cost recovery standards.\n\n2. **Concept 2: Changing Strict Liability to a Fault-Based Standard.** This concept would involve modification of California\u2019s strict liability standard under inverse condemnation to one based on fault to balance the need for public improvements with private harm to individuals.\n \n3. **Concept 3: Wildfire Fund.** This concept would create a wildfire fund coupled with a revised cost recovery standard to spread the cost of catastrophic wildfires more broadly among stakeholders\n\n**Concept 2...**\n-\n is dead in the water. If the legislature was going to alter the state constitution they would have done so when crafting SB 901 for PGE to avoid BK. To enact this change would require a super majority of both chambers of the legislature *and* a ballot initiative. This will not happen this year if it could happen. It stinks to the average Californian who is already weary of their government which is why such a provision exists in the first place. More importantly PGE is bankrupt because of camp fire for which they are almost certainly negligent if not criminally so in which case inverse condemnation changes nothing. It also doesn't abate the costs of wildfires but rather removes the ability to recoup the expense from those who may be at fault. A piece of shit company like PGE causes a fire, but you can't prove negligence? Congrats you and insurance eat the cost but they pay nothing. What happens when home and property owners can't get insurance? As the report notes PGE provides utilities for 40% of the state and 25% of the state's population resides in a high risk area. People can't simply just up and move.\n\nRegardless any action won't come in time:\n\n&gt;\"Inverse condemnation is a hornet\u2019s nest. It\u2019s a tough topic especially because of the constitutional questions around it. We would need a deeper and longer conversation around reforming inverse condemnation that I don\u2019t see happening in 90 days.\"\n\n[-Assembly Utility Committee Chairmen Chris Holden.](https://www.record-bee.com/2019/04/13/newsom-team-calls-for-less-utility-liability-on-wildfire-and-ignites-a-hornets-nest/) By then fire season has already begun.\n\n**Concept 1...**\n-\n has already been adopted in SB 901 but hasn't actually been implemented because:\n\n1. It explicitly doesn't include 2018\n2. CPUC determined to implement it means the company must *first incur the cost of the liability and then apply for a rate increase to cover it.*\n\nThe strike force concept recommends a bridge loan (the fuck) to get them past this impasse. Apparently there can't be a simple approach. The obvious question is who the fuck pays for this shit? \n\nThey recommend a bridge loan fund paid for by investors (which means a stock dilution, not bullish) and rate payers, an possibly extending the DWR fund (really paid by rate payers) set up after the 2001 BK *which is still not paid off.* Their own charts show over $40B in losses for the past 2 years. Worse, if the company if found at fault, then:\n\n&gt;\"If the CPUC determines that the utility did not meet the cost recovery standard and therefore cannot recover costs in rates, then the utility would be required to repay the amounts drawn from the fund such that ratepayers would not bear the cost of such amounts.\"\n\nThat only leaves shareholders or bankruptcy. CPUC still hasn't officially determined fault for Camp Fire but pretty everyone, [including PGE](https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/02/28/pge-equipment-likely-to-be-blamed-for-starting-lethal-camp-fire-utility-says/), agrees they were at fault. This does not fix the problem of bankruptcy. The questions such a fund raise are discouraging from an equity viewpoint:\n\n&gt;* Can the fund provide sufficient liquidity to pay claims in a timely manner while allowing the CPUC to evaluate wildfires?\n&gt;* Can this concept, in combination with necessary changes in the CPUC rate recovery process, provide enough certainty to the capital markets to stabilize ratings and the perception of a utility\u2019s credit quality?\n&gt;* How durable can the liquidity fund be while the utilities address their safety deficiencies? \n&gt;* How much can we expect from this simplified solution if we don\u2019t address the factors that turn massive wildfires into massive damage claims? \n&gt;* What does this option mean for rates and affordability?\n&gt;* **What shareholder contribution, if any, would be required to capitalize the fund?**\n\n**Concept 3...**\n-\n already leaked as proposal (reinforced by statements in the report) that is [less than appealing from an equity stake.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-28/pimco-other-pg-e-creditors-said-to-pitch-35-billion-exit-plan) This seems likely to be the primary plan given this leaked news article and the language of the report. It suggest a \"voluntary\" capitalization from the utilities and a similarly voluntary subrogation agreement for insurers capping liabilities (if this is adopted I hope the wildfires are truly massive):\n\n&gt;\"This concept could accomplish each of these objectives if utility shareholders were prepared to make a substantial contribution to the fund\u2019s claims-paying resources and if insurers were willing to accept a cap on their subrogation claims (their claims for reimbursement from the utilities of the payments to their insurance policyholders). If the wildfire fund is not sufficiently capitalized and/or the other stakeholdersare not willing to compromise their claims,then the wildfire fund will be exhausted more quickly and ratepayers will be responsible for costs thereafter.\"\n\nFood for thought, the market cap of PGE topped out at about $36B (when SP was $70) which is roughly the value of current filed claims in BK. If as the report notes insurance valued (reports terms) for camp fire at $12B is paid out at 50% that only shaves $6B off the [$35-36B](https://restructuring.primeclerk.com/pge/Home-ClaimInfo) in claims filed in BK court.\n\nA significant point that is ill-addressed is the utilities have only two sources of funding:\n\n1. Rate payers\n2. Stock issuance\n\nUnless CA is gonna also stick it to the tax payers there really is no other way around this problem. There is talk of making insurers (what?) and *wildfire lawyers* (the hell?) pay \"their fair share\" for the problem. \n\nOne point never seriously addressed is what value, if any, investor owned utilities or IOUs (lol seriously). There's a throwaway line that somehow these utilities are cheaper (they're not, in fact their customers pay more on average). No commentators address this point either: What exactly is the role of a investor backed utility if it costs more and doesn't spend on needed capital? I currently suspect they're only useful in the current environment as a scapegoat for the state to short change the citizens in a way they otherwise couldn't.\n\n**There's a whole section on PGE:**\n-\nStrangely recent news which failed to move stock price was the revelation [a grand jury is looking at Camp Fire and has subpoenaed documents from PGE relating to the tower](https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/State-Grand-Jury-Issues-Subpoenas-in-Camp-Fire-Probe-508347641.html) suspected as causing the blaze. This fact moves the conversation far from strict liability/inverse condemnation, past negligence, to criminal negligence. Given the [reporting on public documents relating to PGE's maintenance of the suspected tower failure is supportive of negligence](https://www.wsj.com/articles/pg-e-delayed-safety-work-on-power-line-that-is-prime-suspect-in-california-wildfire-11551292977), criminal negligence for a company already on criminal probation is hardly far fetched. The elements for negligence are a slam dunk at this point if the tower did cause the fire:\n\n1. PGE had multiple towers of similar vintage collapse on that line in 2012.\n2. It *stated* in publicly filed documents the risk of failure was *high* but felt the risk of fire was low.\n3. The towers were rated at a 75 year lifespan but were still in operation nearing year 100\n4. It delayed, repeatedly, over years scheduled maintenance for the tower in question (as late as June 2018), including months before failure *despite the fires the previous year* (2017). \n\n^ that's negligence *at minimum.* More than likely it rises to the level of [criminal negligence.](https://www.shouselaw.com/involuntary_manslaughter.html)\n\nOther elements of this report address initiatives which were only recently added in SB 901 without even mentioning such programs are in their infancy such CPUC wildfire mitigation plan reporting elements.\n\nHow can statements such as this be good for PGE stock:\n\n&gt;\"Evaluate Any Proposals to Satisfy 2017-2018 Wildfire Claims. PG&amp;E must satisfy the claims against it from the 2017-2018 wildfires. To that end, the state should evaluate the structure and amount of any trust or other mechanism to satisfy those claims to assure victims are fully and fairly treated. In addition, the state must evaluate any plan of reorganization to assess whether provisions of that plan could disadvantage existing and future wildfire victims.\"\n\nor\n\n&gt;\"Require that PG&amp;E\u2019s Investors Contribute to a Solution. Part 3 of this report identified certain conceptual approaches to the wildfire liability framework applicable to IOUs. While PG&amp;E would be a beneficiary of any of those constructs, PG&amp;E\u2019s investors must contribute to any solution adopted by the state to address wildfire liabilities in a way that benefits consumers. Those contributions could take a variety of forms, including investing in wildfire mitigation and safety or providing funding for other solutions.\"\n\nor\n\n&gt;\"Continue Appropriate Regulatory Oversight. Although PG&amp;E is in chapter11, the CPUC also has a substantial say in the future of PG&amp;E (as it does for all IOUs). For example, the CPUC has the power to review PG&amp;E\u2019s WMP and its compliance with that plan, as well as to review PG&amp;E\u2019s safety culture assessment. The CPUC also has the authority to impose substantial penalties on PG&amp;E for failure to comply with applicable regulations. Moreover, through the rate-setting function, the CPUC may provide incentives for PG&amp;E to make prudent expenditures on, and investments in, safety. This can include actions, such as adjusting the allowed return on equity, that directly affect investors and management. The CPUC should continue to provide appropriate regulatory oversight.\"\n\nor\n\n&gt;\"Given the long history of safety failures and the critical interests at stake, the state can take no options off the table, including municipalization of all or a portion of PG&amp;E\u2019s operations; division of PG&amp;E\u2019s service territories into smaller, regional markets; refocusing PG&amp;E\u2019s operations on transmission and distribution; or reorganization of PG&amp;E as a new company structured to meet its obligations to California..\"\n\nAnd I can go on and on about what a piece of shit company PGE is, from telling their criminal probation judge they aren't compliant with state law on fire mitigation efforts and have no ability or intention to do so leading to their [dividends being suspended indefinitely](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/judge-to-oversee-pges-wildfire-safety-plans-bars-shareholder-dividends-2019-04-02) (that's great for share price right?). Or how instead of funding fire abatement adequately they paid out $4.5B in dividends for years?\n\nLesson learned, state away from institutional investors favored stocks, cause shit is fucked.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDisclaimer: I'm still shorting this shit. If I get more money I'll short it again. There's a chance I'll get the timing wrong but I think the legislature won't act quickly (it is california) and this year's wildfire become admin claims (wet spring + dry summer = kindling). Regardless same disclaimers as before: I'm short PCG, fuck this piece of shit company, and fuck the hedge funds propping up its stock.", "created_utc": 1555220917, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bczryv/pcg_strike_force_jesus_christ_report/", "is_self": true}
