He looks like he just got out of a bong-ripping competition at the local dispensary and sells extra-strength edibles to your local high school freshmen. 2 things occurred to me as I found out what this dude actually looks like:\n\n1. It's highly likely he has no idea wtf he's doing.\n2. You're a literal retard if you trust this half-baked manchild to safeguard your money.\n\nAlso, I have this sneaking suspicion his Indian partner Baiju Bhatt likely did most of the programming for the platform. But even he looks like he just spent 3 weeks straight tripping balls on a volkswagon van somewhere in middle America.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qppj6sbi82141.png?width=641&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=071762c6f5d9a34dc6f95e9c3858e5ff7c392e4b\n\nTF is up with this leadership, man?
