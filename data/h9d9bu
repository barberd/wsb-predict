You take breaks. You are almost never going to sit at the tables and gamble *100%* of the time. Why? It\u2019s exhausting.\n\nIf you\u2019re anything like me, you circle and eye the right table, striking when the opportunity feels right. Or also like me and play poker, you play the right hands and fold the ones that aren\u2019t working out. Still gambling, but strategic.\n\nIf the table sucks, you leave or change tables, take a break, cool off, etc. Many of you are getting far too emotionally married to your positions or your bias, and it will hurt you in the end. Look at what happened to bears who held on past the March lows. \n\nThis market isn\u2019t going anywhere. It\u2019s an election year and there will be volatility til 2021. Take a deep breath, it\u2019s not going anywhere.\n\nPoint of the message is this: don\u2019t rush into trades because you are anxious to constantly be in a trade. Play it more like poker, waiting for the right opportunities to play, and take breaks.. it\u2019s mentally and financially exhausting always being in a trade (options specifically).\n\nI say this to hopefully prevent someone from mistakenly ruining their account and becoming suicidal/depressed. Or even just letting trading take over their life. It\u2019s okay to take breaks.", "created_utc": 1592215097.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h9d9bu/psa_you_dont_have_to_be_in_a_trade_100_of_the_time/", "is_self": true}
