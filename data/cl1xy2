But the reason why Futura were so  \nintrigued was because, while Viagra, Cialis and other drugs have to be taken orally \u2013 meaning they reach  \nthe target area via the bloodstream and so interact with other systems in the body \u2013 GTN could be rapidly  \nabsorbed into erectile tissue through the skin. This meant that it could potentially be applied directly as part  \nof a gel or cream, with almost instantaneous results and none of the troublesome side effects associated with Viagra.  \n\n\n\u201cViagra and Cialis are quite effective drugs but 50% of people stop using them within a year,\u201d  \nsays James. \u201c60-70% of people have some degree of dissatisfaction with them.  \nThis shows there\u2019s an opportunity\u00a0if we can come to market with something that addresses  \nmany\u00a0of those\u00a0concerns.\u201d  \n\n\nOver the past decade, Futura have developed a GTN-based gel called Eroxon which appears to be capable  \nof inducing an erection in patients with mild to moderate erectile dysfunction in five to 10 minutes.  \nAlready dubbed the new Viagra by some, it seems to have the potential to be the first genuinely  \nnovel treatment\u00a0for erectile dysfunction in two decades, and Futura have even tentatively placed its  \npotential commercial **value at $1bn.**  \n\n\nAfter investors showed a renewed interest in backing novel treatments for erectile dysfunction,  \nFutura completed\u00a0a\u00a0[**clinical trial of 232 patients**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1743609517318520)\u00a0last year, and have now embarked on a final phase III  \ntrial of 1,000 patients to be\u00a0completed by the end of 2019.  \nIf this succeeds, Eroxon could become available clinically within the next\u00a0couple of years, although urologists remain cautious.  \n\n\n\u201cThe biggest question from that phase III trial will be how they compare in clinical efficacy to Viagra,\u201d  \nsays Soni. \u201cIn the past, we\u2019ve seen that it\u2019s difficult to get similar efficacy with topical administration,  \nbut at the same time, our understanding of how drugs can be absorbed through the skin into the bloodstream  \nhas massively improved.\u201d", "created_utc": 1564738919, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cl1xy2/futura_medical_plc/", "is_self": true}
