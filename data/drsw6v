The user can continue selling options in this way to artificially inflate their buying power an infinite amount of times. In the past day, on an internet trading forum known as Wallstreet Bets ([http://reddit.com/wallstreetbets](http://reddit.com/wallstreetbets)), a young trader with a 2k deposit was able to artificially inflate his buying power to over 50k and spent all that on AAPL puts, which he promptly lost. Other traders have seen the exploit as well, there is another example of a trader using over 800k buying power on margin with only a 15k deposit, and another trader recently used the same strategy to use over 1 million dollars worth of buying power. Robinhood is clearly violating Federal Regulation T, as these traders are easily trading with over 25x margin leverage, as opposed to the 2x allowed by the regulation. These exploits can be seen here respectively: \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpnzup/i\\_recorded\\_todays\\_marketopen\\_and\\_the\\_instant/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpnzup/i_recorded_todays_marketopen_and_the_instant/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/drlmxq/time\\_to\\_one\\_up\\_ctn/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/drlmxq/time_to_one_up_ctn/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/drqaro/robinhood\\_free\\_money\\_cheat\\_works\\_pretty\\_well\\_1/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/drqaro/robinhood_free_money_cheat_works_pretty_well_1/)", "created_utc": 1572921805, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/drsw6v/just_filed_complaint_to_sec_whistleblower_office/", "is_self": true}
