{"id": "ffwr5b", "title": "Options - Calls and Puts", "selftext": "Hey everyone, I've been following this autis group for a while now,  and am looking to try and take stab at this whole gay bear thing.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've only ever traded stocks and I have never messed around with options.  So far I have read about options and watched a few videos on them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am trying to understand exactly how they work.  Let's say I am buying a call for TSLA to be at $660 by Friday, March 20th and the strike price is $630.  If it only reaches $650 by Friday and I sell before the contract expires, do I still profit?  Does the price have to reach the contract price or &gt; for me to sell and profit, or will I take a loss if I sell for less then what I bought my call option for? What happens when I do sell my call option? Do I then get the option to buy the stock at that price? or do I make the profit per share based on how the stonk gained? Would I need 66k in capital to buy the contract if TSLA hit $660?\n\nAnd if the price goes inverse on me and TSLA goes to $600 by Friday do I lose the whole premium I paid for the call option?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for all the questions and if this is hard to understand, I am trying to ask questions as detailed as I can with the information I know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for any and all help.", "created_utc": 1583769237, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffwr5b/options_calls_and_puts/", "is_self": true}
