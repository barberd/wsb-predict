Long story short, on Wednesday, I realized that GILD was rising too fast and RGS (Superclips) would soon close down locations soon due to the beer virus (which they did the day after I placed da puts). Being the 'tard that I am, I placed my first 'put'. I saw a few YouTube videos and felt confident that my options would 'take me to the moon'. Please note, I don't know how to sell a put or 'exercise' the option. It's like you guys inspired me to hold a grenade, but never throw it. Yesterday morning, I was down 2k and by afternoon I pussied out and sold all options. If I had kept my options in place and followed my intuition, I'd be up by 2k at least today. At the minimum, my Aspergers kicked in yesterday and I bought in MRNA after it dropped from $34 to $26 per share and made $800 in a couple of minutes to offset my losses. Reading your posts and reading the news has kinda given me a new lease on life and something to look forward to each morning. I hope to one day take you tards to the moon in my short bus one day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL:DR - Lost 10%+ of my portfolio in a day and don't care.", "created_utc": 1584752247.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fm6h4r/you_tardsautists_make_life_worth_living/", "is_self": true}
