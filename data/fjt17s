We are adopting a short sale-related circuit breaker that, if triggered, will impose a restriction on the prices at which securities may be sold short (\u201cshort sale price test\u201d or \u201cshort sale price test restriction\u201d).  Specifically, the Rule requires that a trading center establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent the execution or display of a short sale order of a covered security at a price that is less than or equal to the current national best bid if the price of that covered security decreases by 10% or more from the covered security\u2019s closing price as determined by the listing market for the covered security as of the end of regular trading hours on the prior day.  In addition, the Rule requires that the trading center establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to impose this short sale price test restriction for the remainder of the day and the following day when a national best bid for the covered security is calculated and disseminated on a current and continuing basis by a plan processor pursuant to an effective national market system plan.  We believe it is appropriate at this time to adopt a short sale-related circuit breaker because, when triggered, it will prevent short selling, including potentially manipulative or abusive short selling, \nfrom driving down further the price of a security that has already experienced a significant intra-day price decline, and will facilitate the ability of long sellers to sell first upon such a decline.  This approach establishes a narrowly-tailored Rule that will target only those securities that are experiencing significant intra-day price declines. We believe that addressing short selling in connection with such declines in individual securities will help address erosion of investor confidence in our markets generally. \n\nTL:DR calls or cash the next two days, then more pain, although looking at the list of companies that got put on the ban list on Friday, most were down a shitload today as well, so nevermind, who the fuck knows lol", "created_utc": 1584394972.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjt17s/beware_buying_puts_on_things_that_dropped_over_10/", "is_self": true}
