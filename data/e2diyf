I just jumped into Robinhood with 2.5k in late September, I had a good opportunity with BYND and rode it down from 110-96, but my autism struck and my research was not wise.. so I inversed myself.  Nah, it dropped to 78 - AND - I held that call in ..  late October?  (My first play was actually happily riding NIO on a wave down up 400% on ;P 36$).  Lost 600 or so on BYND though.  \n\nThe story goes on.  But I\u2019ve learned much more, and although I\u2019m down 80% I noticed obviously that you see patterns at least among sectors, and some are much biglier winners than their competition.  Recently I realized retail is obviously really popping this time of year due to the holidays and a number of companies (Target, Best Buy, Dicks) did have some major moves to the moon...  (also feel like this is such a meme named series of companies that would be just obvious and clear to get in on as a Wall Street joker)\n\nAre there other times of the year where certain sectors all do well and some of course much more than others?  Or also can it be circumstantial, like how a lack of Intel chips caused revenue loss for Dell &amp; HP, and by the looks of things with AMD, Intel could possibly go down bigly as well?\n\nJust some questions and food for thought", "created_utc": 1574845913, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e2diyf/sectors_their_historical_periods_of_large_volume/", "is_self": true}
