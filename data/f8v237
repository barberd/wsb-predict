Anywho, I was holding these shades so I could sell covered calls and collect on premium. That was going all fine and dandy until my account got locked back in December, so since then I've just been waiting for my account to be opened again in order to start selling calls again. As you can see, Roku ain't been doing so hot since December, and I'm down bigly. So, during this debacle of Roku downies, I was margin called once about a month or so ago. I deposited 2500 to keep my precious shares. No biggie. Fast forward to just now and I get a notification through the app that 99 shares were sold at 112.xx, a ~4300 dollar loss. I never made this trade. I reach out to support to let them know what happened and how I think I got boned because I was never issued a margin call, and had I known, I would've deposited more to keep my shares. About a half hour after reaching out to support, I get an email from RH that says I was issued a margin call on February 21st. I was never issued this margin call. They didn't email me, they didn't push a notification through the app, and the app never indicated as such. What can I do here?", "created_utc": 1582566791, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f8v237/rh_liquadating_shares_without_giving_me_notice_of/", "is_self": true}
