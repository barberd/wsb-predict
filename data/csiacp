{"id": "csiacp", "title": "Target $TGT Bullish DD WITH Bearish Case \ud83d\udc2e \ud83d\udc3b", "selftext": "So here\u2019s an autistic reason why Target will do great. First of all the store is freaking packed with people and savings. I\u2019m a toy reseller and Target has been beating Walmart and Amazon in deals all of last quarter. Target now is trying to Put a CVS in all of their stores in order to reduce their cost in rent by leasing out part of their cost onto CVS. It\u2019s a massive advantage to have a name brand pharmacy right in your store. Plus if we look at how well Wal-Mart recently did it would be difficult to even consider puts. Targets also sometimes have Starbucks in them only furthering their profit margin. Target sitting at around $85-90 a share, by the books, in theory this stock is UNDERVALUED. It also has a buy rating by most analysts for this reason. Target has been pushed against the wall and is now throwing out hard punches at the competition. As for the bearish case there\u2019s a small chance a recession would hurt them especially if Chinese tariffs worsen, however I believe this is speculation when compared to the raw statistics of this stock. Don\u2019t expect a 10% move but a 5% move would not be surprising.\nDisclaimer: I am not LONG $TGT, make decisions on your own do research yada yada yada blah blah", "created_utc": 1566227073, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/csiacp/target_tgt_bullish_dd_with_bearish_case/", "is_self": true}
