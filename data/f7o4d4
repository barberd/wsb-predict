The RSI also has fallen to the 50's (an indicator that the  markets believe that the stock is no longer overbought). RSI has been over 70 up through this last week, so this should be a welcome indicator for those long MSFT. \n\nTypically, if MSFT were to continue to drop well below the 50 day SMA, then that would be cause for concern in the intermediate-term regarding the continued growth sustainability. Considering MSFT has been a stall ward for the Dow the last year or two, and that losses the last two weeks a have been in large part exaggerated by MSFT, its recovery should help the market rebound as well.", "created_utc": 1582348780, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7o4d4/stay_strong_followers_of_lord_nutella_msft_has/", "is_self": true}
