{"id": "czuyqn", "title": "DOMO earnings (9/5)", "selftext": "They are expected to have a $1.00 loss per share (41-42M this quarter). \n\neBay, tribune, Comcast, dell, MasterCard and target have begun using their cloud.\n\nThey only have around 20M shares, so this should imply volatility. \n\nUp with 32% year over growth. \n\nDOMO has nearly 500 enterprise customers. \n\nWith cloud predicting to be a 250B market by 2020, I think this company has a lot of room for growth. \n\nI got my hands on Fastly, cloudshare, crowdstrike holdings, and of course the monster Shopify. \n\nI think expansion for these have potential. Anybody else got thoughts on DOMO?", "created_utc": 1567651676, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/czuyqn/domo_earnings_95/", "is_self": true}
