Reported sales were $20.5 billion, 1.3% less than in the second quarter last year, but better than the FactSet consensus estimate of $20.3 billion.\"\n\nDoes anyone care to explain to my smooth brain self why shares are down 1.4% if they beat top and bottom line estimates? I mean, sure they knowingly gave cancer to thousands of innocent babies, but who among us isn't guilty of the exact same thing?", "created_utc": 1563288074, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cdxwz9/jnj_earnings_beat/", "is_self": true}
