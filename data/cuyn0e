{"id": "cuyn0e", "title": "How To Loan: The WSB Guide", "selftext": "**Step 1:** Find a P2P lending service (Upstart/Prosper)\n\n**Step 2:** Apply for a loan with the reason for the loan being ***student loan ( MOST IMPORTANT IF ITS NOT A STUDENT LOAN DO NO TAKE IT OUT)***\n\n**Step 3:** Interest rate doesn\u2019t matter but origination fee does. I know Upstart shows different interest/origination for different time frames/loans. Fuck with it a little get that origination fee ***LOW***.\n\n**Step 4:** Get approved. \n\n***Intermission:*** Once you are approved you will have to wait for the loan to hit your credit report/ receive funds. For me this happened within a week. Feel free to purchase FD's while you wait.\n\n**Step 5:** Go to SoFi.com (or any other student loan subsidization company)\n\n**Step 6:** Apply for a student loan refinancing. Make sure you select your most recent P2P lender as the party being credited. You will need your Upstart ID/Loan details when you select it from the menu. \n\n**Step 7:** Choose your interest rate/payments. SoFi lets you subsidize your student loans in different ways. For example you can get a lower monthly payment but have a higher overall interest or higher monthly payments and lower interest.\n\n**Profit:** Since SoFi is assisted as a government subsidy for student loans, they are not allowed to charge huge interest rates like Upstart for student loans. I personally took out a loan from Upstart for 22% and was able to refinance the loan right after the first payment hit my account. Now I\u2019m borrowing 20k for 10 years at 6.5% with monthly payments of $180 vs $554.\n\n***Final Notes:*** Don't be a retard with the loan, its still a loan and will have to be paid back.", "created_utc": 1566678503, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cuyn0e/how_to_loan_the_wsb_guide/", "is_self": true}
