This get together will help us plan our corporation, our location, our portfolio, and plans on how to make our new home not a piece of shit wasteland but a well designed, futuristic place where Tesla and AMD will set up shop and pay our citizens well.\n\nWe will all be required to take our medication at the door, shower before entry, and leave all ninja katanas at coat check.\n\nWe'll be doing it in Denver to use as a model of what we don't want to become. Denver is so fucking gay.\n\nI will organize the website, and sell tickets for fractional shares of FB.\n\nThe convention will be called the Denver Inquiry on the Creation of our Kingdom, or DICK.\n\nI'm not joking. Y'all seem to be playing but I'm going to make this happen.", "created_utc": 1579463187, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/er15v1/autist_convention_in_denver_to_decide_our_new_home/", "is_self": true}
