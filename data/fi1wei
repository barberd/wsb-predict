Their most important (and undeniably their main goal) is to keep the market pumped up until November.\n\nThe current admin's base, while so smart, so beautiful, great genes & best education, will eat up anything that's thrown at them. Now, understand this.\n\n\n\n**Meat**\n\nThe current drop is due to the expectation that a lot of these companies (think travel, etc) will have large negative cashflow. The shorts are pricing in worst of the worst news. What does this actual worst of the worst scenario look like?\n\n1) **Travel & Quarantines** - What this means for hospitality & Airlines: IF such a restriction is placed, which is not unlikely when the case numbers explode, these companies will be bleeding money. They'll have to pay essential staff & service their accounts payable. Now, a fucking payroll tax cut doesn't really do much for these companies, [because most non-essential staff has been asked to go on unpaid leave](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/05/coronavirus-work-travel-restrictions/). I have flight attendant friends who have not been given a schedule for over a week. They've been told to expect much more cuts & advised to be prepared. This is all public information.\n\n\n**Tl;dr**: Payroll taxes aren't killing the cashflow & are a very miniscule part of AP in large firms. Beer virus is killing them. Payroll tax cuts do jack shit.\n\n\n\n2) **Companies unable to service their debt**: This is why the Fed just pumped 1.5T into their repo. It's a whole thing, but basically thicc banks with thicc CEOs (think Jaime \"Keeps-sucking-after-you-nut Dimon) need liqiuidity to service their credit lines with shit propped up & highly levered companies such as GE (an American staple, of course). Same thing with Oil, and their 0.5T of literal junkbonds. These companies are equiavelent of WeWork now, in how much profit they have generated for their shareholders. Now, the fed will prevent these large blocks of debt from becoming toxic, but oil in itself is not the issue right now. The issue is consumption. IF people are not consuming anything during a crisis other than TP & Costco water bottles, other companies reliant on positive cashflow to stay afloat will take a big hit. Levered up companies such as AAL are exposed, very bigly, very beautifully & might eat shit.\n\n\n\n**Tl;dr**: When people aren't consuming, levered up & debt exposed companies can't service their accounts payable & may go to 0. As Johnald foretold this upon us as he had this uncle at MIT, beautiful genius, great genes, stable genius and so smart, Dr. Trump was perfect just like his perfect call and the perfect transcript. You have 15 cases and then in a couple of days those 15 cases go back to zero. Now that's pretty good.\n\n\n\n3) **Politics**: Half of the market loves the beautiful genes & perfect speeches of Johnald. The smarter half takes it at face value. This means if Johnald continues lying & obfuscating, trying to campagin during a crisis, people will lose confidence over time. If the markets keep going down & Johnald keeps putting band aids on the cancer that is Coronavirus, at some point the cancer is gonna over take the band-aids. The fed will be out of ammo & they can do jack shit to prop up the markets. They can buy assets, they can cut income tax to -20% but containment & the actual virus will not be affected.\n\n\n\n**TL;DR**\nIf a quarantine is placed in the United States, the downward trend will continue. If people are not consuming, many levered companies will be exposed to negative cash flow. If Johnald continues to hope for the best (very unlike him, don't you think) & keeps his reality TV shenanigans up, the market will lose confidence & the fed will be out of ammo.\n\n\n\nShort Positions & [my horology chart](https://i.imgur.com/sybUbTY.png)\n\n\n* $SPY 3/20 IC 225P / 230P / 250C / 255C\n* $SH 5/15 $24c $25c $26c\n* $AAL 4/17 16P, 17P\n* $SAVE 4/17 22.50P\n* $LUV 4/17 40P", "created_utc": 1584115277.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fi1wei/analysis_on_why_the_bulls_will_be_fucked_by_the/", "is_self": true}
