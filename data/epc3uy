You didn\u2019t catch $AAPL $TSLA $BYND (trash) $NFLX $AMZN $FB or $GOOG lemme introduce you to $SPCE . You see, these guys went ipo without a roadshow by buying a company that was already listed. As in, the banksters did not get a chance to fuck everyone over. \n\nCurrently trading at 15ish with a 3B valuation. This stonk easily goes 3x to less than 10B MC at 45ish. Money is free and looking for a home. Hundreds of billions are sloshing around the world looking for growth. Everyone wants to get off this death rock and Branson is selling tickets. \n\nBut like why should this be worth way way more? 50x 2021 sales of 200m gets us to a 10B MC. And these guys are worth it cause they represent the future of how things will be done. People invest in a dream and these guys are dreaming really fucking big. \n\nCompetition is good. Blue origin. SpaceX. All good. Only thing that can not happen is dead space explorers. As long as every shuttle lands in one piece there is nothing that stops this stupid stonk. \n\nI\u2019m super long and strong, and if I don\u2019t see you autists on the moon, I\u2019ll catch you on Mars. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/8bKAEQY", "created_utc": 1579138542, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/epc3uy/gather_round_all_ye_autists_for_some_spce_dd/", "is_self": true}
