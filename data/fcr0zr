This resulted in outages across many of our services, preventing customers from using our app, website, and help center.\n\nAt this time, we have restored Robinhood services.\n\nAre the funds in my account safe?\nYes, your funds are safe.\n\nWas my personal information affected?\nNo, your personal information was not affected.\n\nCan I use my Robinhood debit card?\nYes. If you have a debit card, you should have been\u2014and should still be able to\u2014use your card, but you may have had issues receiving notifications, viewing your balance, and seeing transactions in your app.\n\nHow do I use the credit for three months of Robinhood Gold?\nAs a Gold customer, we\u2019re giving you credit for three months of your subscription fee. We\u2019ve already applied the subscription credits to your account for the next three billing cycles. The monthly subscription fee will appear in your account history with the applied credits.\n\nIf you invest on margin as a part of Gold, you will still pay the additional 5% annual interest fees for your margin balances over $1,000 during these three months.\n\nIf I had options expiring on March 2, 2020, what happened to them?\nBecause of the outage, we handled your expiring positions in a slightly different manner. If your contracts were at least $0.01 in the money, your long contracts were exercised and your short contracts were likely assigned. Please reach out to us if you have additional questions.\n\nWhat if I emailed or tweeted earlier, but I still haven\u2019t gotten a response?\nOur support team is experiencing high volume and cannot respond within our usual response time. We apologize if you\u2019ve been unable to contact us during this time.\nWe\u2019ll respond to you as soon as we can and work with you directly to address your concerns.", "created_utc": 1583219843, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fcr0zr/email_i_just_got_from_robinhood_including_faq/", "is_self": true}
