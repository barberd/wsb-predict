{"id": "gbkpnu", "title": "What am I Missing?", "selftext": "So, BLDR released earnings yesterday in which they beat EPS projections by 21.43%, sales by 20million, and had organic growth of a little over 3% outside of acquisitions. Now what confuses me is that it went down today. Was this purely driven by the market?? This is the way I see it: They had equivalent EPS from Q1 2019 to now this Q1 2020. Not only did they meet/beat earnings, but these weren\u2019t adjusted earnings from the virus. BLDR has maintained and grown from quarters before the virus. So if the stock was at $28 before the crash, and is now at $17, with it beating earnings and increasing sales from the numbers posted BEFORE the virus, why is the value not $28 or higher. Essentially this earnings showed that they haven\u2019t missed a beat since the virus started. The only counter I could possibly think of is anticipation of next quarters results being low due to real estate lending companies not funding new projects, thus making the supply for BLDR\u2019s goods decrease. I have a hard time believing that the day after a 21% earnings beat, people are already trading in anticipation of the next quarters earnings. And I don\u2019t want to hear \u201cwell the 50% gain over this last week is the earnings being priced in\u201d the reason this doesn\u2019t work for me is as I mentioned above. Based off sales and book value, the company is unchanged if not better than when it was trading at $28", "created_utc": 1588348618.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gbkpnu/what_am_i_missing/", "is_self": true}
