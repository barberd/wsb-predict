That sucks is plummeting and puts are reasonable prices are hard to come by. The ZM calls I suggested are also now too expensive. Congrats if you got in at the time of my post.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMoving on. There\u2019s still a few good deals in food. I\u2019m going off my own habits here, I\u2019m a several times a week MCD and SBUX customer. After stopping in last week and observing the flow of hands from customer credit cards, to machines, straight to food products and drinks, I\u2019ve mostly sworn off eating at any fast food establishment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMCD price is rising but SBUX puts are still very reasonable. Added more of both this week.\n\nMy positions:\n\nMCD 4/3 190 @ 1.15\n\nMCD 4/9 190 @ 3.85\n\nSBUX 4/3 70 @ 0.65\n\nSBUX 4/24 70 @ 3.65", "created_utc": 1583524981.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fej8uw/following_up_on_my_previous_post_with_amazing/", "is_self": true}
