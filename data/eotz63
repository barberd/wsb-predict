{"id": "eotz63", "title": "Apples current valuation seems fair discussion", "selftext": "So in the last 20 years Apple has gone from an true innovator, basically revolutionizing life as we know it with the advent of the modern smartphone (and even iPods before it, but I was always a zune fag, so not really gonna speak on iPods, and fuck off my zune still works). The app market was a fucking gold mine where 3rd parties did the work and apple got a super lucrative cut, they were able to wave that big dick market share of phone users in front of would be app developers and basically force them to pay whatever Apple said they\u2019d pay. So by selling ridiculously expensive phones and basically bending over app developers they were able to hoard a ridiculous fucking cash stash, but it seemed they lacked direction and innovation after Steve die, and at this point they seemed to transform into a more traditional retailer, focusing on expanding market share by putting iPhones into the hands of the late adopters (ur aunts and uncles), and finally the laggards (ur moms and dads), by adding lines of more reasonably priced phones that would work in tandem with Needing a smart phone to see pics of their grandkids on facespace. The market penetration was pretty textbook, while simultaneously integrating vertically by seizing the means of production (get fucked qcom).\n\nAnd now I believe is where they pivot and expand very rapidly across the board, Apple Pay for money, Apple TV for entertainment, Apple news for well news. It\u2019s too early to see what will stick but now they seem to be back to their innovative roots. Traditionally Apple has always traded as a super super low pe relative to tech, but not far off an average consumer cyclical or retail good producer. So as Apple releases details of their new endeavors their business expands beyond phone sales and app developer extortionists, and aim for global amazon level domination (for example if Apple traded at amazon pe it would be over 1k, not saying it should and I\u2019m aware it\u2019s apples to oranges, but to prove a point of how Apple price range is putting its pe in a more fair range).\n\nAnd that giant slut dragon cash stash gives Apple the ability to very very aggressively pursue these new avenues of revenue stream while enjoying an income of phone sales and app distribution extortion fees. Personally I feel one of the most effective ways to find hidden value is to find stocks that analysts Classify incorrectly, I guess an example would be Atvi was being compared and sympathy moving along with toy makers, when in reality analysts imo hadn\u2019t realized the potential video game industry had and why it was different then hasbro. Additionally apples balance sheet seems to be as pure as the driven snow, so if a recession ever does hit, they should be able to weather it and scoop up some companies who over leveraged and are about to go under.", "created_utc": 1579046284, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eotz63/apples_current_valuation_seems_fair_discussion/", "is_self": true}
