{"id": "bc376p", "title": "Martin Shkreli Back Home in Brooklyn...Kinda", "selftext": "Feds have a sense of humor - Confirmed.  Martin gets moved back to Brooklyn (Detention Center) almost exactly one year after he was moved from it.  Why?  Several possibilities..\n\n\\---The most likely is that he will be transferred to a tougher prison but not before he first receives felony charges for the phone and running an enterprise in Federal Prison.  Fort Dix has a thriving cell phone market that Martin just ruined for staff and inmates.  Not good.  The last thing you want to be in prison is THAT guy.  Our Martin is THAT guy.\n\n\\---He ratted on staff/inmates.  Contraband comes via staff to trusted inmates who then sell them to guys like Martin.  Martin surely did not know which staff members are part of the ring (he was a newcomer who ran a blog).  So, if he ratted he did on an inmate.  That will get you moved to a facility (Southwest USA has a few of them that I know of) with rats, homosexual pedophiles, etc.  Probably the best place for someone like Martin who will only get himself into horrible trouble if he is ever in general population.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBest case scenario.  He will lose time served and the Feds will force him to serve his full-sentence (October 2023).  In return, they will drop the cell phone and running an enterprise charges.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI knew Martin was clueless when he blogged about gambling in prison.   Prison is not like the movies.  Guys who survive prison are not big dudes.  They are not rich dudes.  They are not gang members.  They are quiet dudes who keep their mouths shut.  That is who survives prison.", "created_utc": 1555006574, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bc376p/martin_shkreli_back_home_in_brooklynkinda/", "is_self": true}
