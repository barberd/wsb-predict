I am too lazy to try to entertain you fickle ricks this AM. Just listen to this glorified pill counter aka (as the IRS likes to remind me during tax time) pharmacist and make money... or you can just git!    \n\n**Why I am Bullish:**     \nThe reason I am bullish on BCRX is that the study have shown the drug to be able to work, theoretically speaking, against COVID-19. [Just peruse this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102646/).     \nNow, any pharmacist worth their salt will tell you that if Galidesivir is approved, it will outsell any of those other drugs listed with it in that study, why?    \n[**it's a fucking oral medication**, which every health institution in the world prefers over IV or IM](https://contagion.s3.amazonaws.com/_media/_thumb/HIV-AIDS-12_19-Table.png). EVERY hospital and clinic would usually have standing policy per nationals guidelines (don't have time to dig out which ones) to assess patients that are NPO (nothing by mouth) every day to see if it is okay to switch to an equivalent oral form.\n\nThis is just my perspective; [u/cpapa010 had a pretty good write up that I feel went under the radar and made me take a closer look at the company behind the drug](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghx1pw/bcrx_dd_possible_coronavirus_antiviral_and_hae/).    \n\n[The drug is gaining attention and I feel like this will get even more attention than Gild/Remdesivir](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=%2Fm%2F0121l4tk) in the [next few days and weeks](https://www.barchart.com/story/stocks/quotes/BCRX/overview/4879199/is-biocryst-pharmaceuticals-bcrx-stock-outpacing-its-medical-peers-this-year), especially after the [conference scheduled for this morning](https://www.barchart.com/story/stocks/quotes/BCRX/overview/4840588/biocryst-to-present-at-upcoming-investor-conferences).\n\nHolding BCRX 5/15 5c.     \n\n[Nuveen Asset Mgmt just bought a bunch of shares today in anticipation of the conference call today](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/BCRX/institutional-ownership/).", "created_utc": 1589452189.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gjjsfe/preliminary_results_shows_bcrxs_galidesivir_could/", "is_self": true}
