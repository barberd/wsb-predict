{"id": "bo99xn", "title": "Quick BYND DD: Let's see if the numbers are reasonable.", "selftext": "As we probably all know this company called BYND sells a veggie burger that allegedly tastes pretty good.\n\nFrankly selling a Seitan or Tofu alternative is nice, but the real cash moneyness of this stock is based on whether we think it can disrupt beef and to what extent. (If it can't, it's overvalued.) In theory a plant-based product can be produced for cheaper than real meat, and in fact, become tastier over time, since it is not constrained by things like, having to have functional proteins. Based on BYND's track record, this leads us *a priori* to anticipate an enormous potential opportunity. However the valuation is equally enormous, so we have to take a look at the numbers.\n\nIn 2019 the average American is anticipated to consume 57lb of beef. The average selling price at the slaughterhouse for beef is anticipated to be around $50 per hundredweight. Some simple math gives us a TAM of $9B in annual revenue.\n\nThat's pretty frickin' enormous compared to the current market cap of $4.5B but in all fairness it's not going to replace anywhere close to 100% of beef... yet. \n\nIn a few years if you're betting they can snag 10% of the beef market, you should be long here. If not, then you should probably not be long. (That would be a several year forward P/S of around 5, these are very rough and dirty calculations.) I don't think that's entirely unreasonable given that they are rolling out probably soon to all major chains, have a product that is both premium(in terms of the \"feel good effect\"-- which is VERY real), comparably tasty to real beef burgers, and miles ahead, at least several years ahead, of the competition.\n\nTake a company like JUUL-- very successful, very innovative, large market, valued at $28B. However, their signature product is a battery in a fucking dick stick. What BYND has done is much more technologically difficult and significant, has a larger total addressable market, but otherwise is a pretty good comparison--ie it's a healthy, premium if you like, alternative to a very old industry.\n\nThis is a race to economies of scale where BYND has a significant R&amp;D advantage. And a significant cost structure advantage over a VAST industry, called the motherfucking goddamn BEEF industry, that has been around for literally fucking thousands of years since the Sumerians first decided to keep their sacred animal in a fence so they could jerk off while looking directly into his eyes and gaining his energy.\n\nI'm not long yet, but just thinking about  this stock makes me long in a different sense. I think this is a really cool company, more DDs will have to follow since this one is very preliminary.", "created_utc": 1557781709, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bo99xn/quick_bynd_dd_lets_see_if_the_numbers_are/", "is_self": true}
