The banks are in charge of giving out the money the govt gave them. We\u2019re seeing reports of banks fucking over businesses or people who don\u2019t hold debt in their bank. Market manipulation at the hands of Gilead and the president. \n\nWhat we\u2019re going to likely see.\n\nSmall businesses are going to be left to flounder and die. The bigger players either know this or even helped coordinate it. Assets and markets are going to be cheap in the near future. Things like family restaurants are going be turned into fast food places, stuff like that. Companies that can capitalize on that, like amazon, will go straight to the moon. Private healthcare will shoot straight for Mars, right behind Elon, because public healthcare will be rammed harder than someone buying TSLA puts. Tech companies have already and will continue to make a killing off of consumer fears of being in public. \n\nWe may not see one big recession at all. Rather a bunch of smaller ones spread out over a longer period. The service and retail sectors were the first to go. Next will be manufacturers because their value comes from having made product, and it\u2019s only a matter of time before the efficiencies of these companies catch up to them and they hit the red. Housing market will be down by September as the vast majority of household do not have 6 months rent on hand. The cashflow will be dead.\n\nIt takes months for the consequences to really set in. The banks know this after 08. If they gamed the system before, they\u2019ll keep doing it so long as they think it\u2019ll make money. Short term, stonks up. Anything after July, stonks down. \n\nCurrent positions. \nSPY 300c 4/20\nABT 110c 4/24\nUNH 340c 5/15\nSPY 307.5c 5/1", "created_utc": 1587203278.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g3l0ms/heres_why_i_think_stocks_will_go_up_and_down_here/", "is_self": true}
