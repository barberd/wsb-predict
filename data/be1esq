I'm here to share a good position I opened on Monday (keep your fingers crossed for me it doesn't go tits up, cuz she ain't over yet), and lay some learnin' on y'all.\n\nI had a hunch that NFLX was going to go up after their ER tonight, so I wanted to buy some calls. I opened up the 4/18 option chain and was shocked. \"300% time value?? Ain't no way I'm paying that.\" So instead of just leaving my great hunch behind, I took advantage of those high premiums: I sold puts.\n\n**The Bull Put Spread**\n\nA bull put spread is when you sell a put and also buy a lower-strike put to cap your losses.\n\nMonday morning at open, a NFLX 352.5 put was trading for nearly $15 a share (so $1500 a contract). My broker wisely required I commit nearly $10k of my margin to sell that put, and I didn't feel like closing other positions to enter a new one. What to do? Buy a way-OTM put for $30. \ud83d\ude0eThis took the margin impact down to \\~$3K, since my losses were now capped at $6,750 rather than $35,250. Not bad for thirty bucks.\n\nI sold a 352.5/285 put spread for $1400 in total (14.30 for the 352.5 put, 0.30 for the 285 put). \n\n**Lessons**\n\n* *When premiums are high, profit from others' FOMO by writing options.* Short options won't ever blow up like everyone's DIS calls did last week, but think of how much loss porn from options is on this sub. You know who keeps all that money? Options sellers.\n* *Theta always makes money.* Stonks go up and stonks go down, but time always goes forward. Theta is constantly making you money; all you have to do is make sure that profit isn't offset too badly by a move in the underlying. Case in point: when NFLX dipped like 5% when the ER came out today, *I was still up $200*.
