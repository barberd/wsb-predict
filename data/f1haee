With many analysts concerned that disruptions to the Chinese economy will dent global growth, investors have been clinging to U.S. assets, helping the S&amp;P 500 rebound from its late-January slide and rise last week to a fresh record.\n\nAlthough major indexes and the dollar have climbed in tandem, U.S. companies including\u00a0Johnson &amp; Johnson,\u00a0Coca-Cola\u00a0Co.,\u00a0Ford Motor\u00a0Co.\u00a0and\u00a03M\u00a0Co.\u00a0have mentioned the negative effects of currency swings on earnings calls,\u00a0highlighting a possible challenge\u00a0to the longstanding bull market.
