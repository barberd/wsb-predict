Spit balling here. \n\nIf you had $100,000 laying around to invest in your early 20s and you wanted a safer bet in this cyclical economy you could just buy ~2600 shares of AT&amp;T (Last closed Friday at $37.87), collect their roughly 5.5-6% dividend, and sell weekly covered calls. \n\nQuestion about achieving maximum medium risk for sustained reinvestment income for maximum long term growth. \n\nRight now you could sell 26 contracts of 9/27 38.5 calls for .15 each, which is $390. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but if the stock goes up to 38.5 you would also collect the .87 cents on 2600 shares because its trading at $37.87 today which is $2262 + $390 = $2652, you would sacrifice your shares and have to buy at market price though obviously. However, say it goes up to $38.20, you would still collect the gain on the shares, not lose your shares and collect the premium, which you could reinvest weekly for compounded growth? \n\nIf you could collect $300 (52 weeks a year) a week in premium and a 5.5% dividend on 100k (2600 shares) the ROI assuming the stock doesn\u2019t go up or at down at all would be $5500 (dividend) + $15600 (52x$300) = $21,100 = ~21 percent? That\u2019s assuming you don\u2019t reinvest all dividends and premium as well. Your investment would double every 3.42 years.. with reinvestment of the income it produces i\u2019d assume it would lead to substantially faster doubles. In addition to any growth of the stock itself. \n\nI know T could get crushed one day or go out of business, etc, etc, but I worked for them for 3 and a half years. They\u2019re not going anywhere. They will charge with times. Randall Stephenson is a nimrod, but he will get replaced now that we got a huge player on the board who wants change. \n\nEssentially this strategy would be reducing your risk but capping possible gains if there is an outburst in price? Allowing you to constantly reduce cost basis or buy more shares in long term. \n\nEdit: obviously being careful to not get assigned shares around dividend dates.\n\nObviously you\u2019d want to diversify a little more but the same principle would apply.", "created_utc": 1569138143, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d7ndhl/safe_returns/", "is_self": true}
