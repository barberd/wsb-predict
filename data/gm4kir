{"id": "gm4kir", "title": "The Next Great Meme Stock (FMCI)", "selftext": "As a veteran of the Great Meme War and an investor in all things meme-worthy (see DEAC/DKNG, VTIQ), I am getting pretty hyped on FMCI.  They recently announced that they signed a letter of intent to bring a plant-based food company public via reverse merger ([https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/05/13/2033074/0/en/Forum-Merger-II-Corporation-Announces-Signed-Letter-of-Intent.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/05/13/2033074/0/en/Forum-Merger-II-Corporation-Announces-Signed-Letter-of-Intent.html)).\n\nWhen this letter of intent was first announced there was a lot of speculation that Impossible Foods might be the target.  Then a band of naysayers came around moaning that \"iT cAn'T PoSsIBlY bE ImPoSsIbLe, ThEy ArE tOo BiG oF a CoMpAnY fOr ThIs SpAc!!!\"\n\nWell here is the thing, they are probably right.  But it doesn't matter if the target is not Impossible.  Impossible is only the best case scenario.  The target company could be Just Inc., Before the Butcher, Follow Your Heart, Turtle Island, Oatley, etc. and this SPAC still has so much meme potential.  Right now BYND is the only pure plant-based food play to go public.  With the recent success of BYND everyone is going to want to get in on this SPAC, just like everyone wanted to get in on the \"next Tesla\" with VTIQ/NKLA.\n\n**TLDR**: I'm loading up on FMCI shares & warrants because this will become the next great meme stock when everyone wants a piece of the \"next BYND.\"", "created_utc": 1589818869.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gm4kir/the_next_great_meme_stock_fmci/", "is_self": true}
