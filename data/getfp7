Expect SPY to have a red may outside a couple bumps.\n\nOn the flip side QQQ has been doing well during SPYs slumps (and DIAs for those who have it) and analysts see QQQ out performing both by December.\n\nI had partially moved into QQQ anticipating the rally to crash at some point for SPY, and it helped reduce losses, now I'm all in taking everything out of SPY outside puts and have seen nothing but gains for QQQ.\n\nPeople are still clinging to SPY for now, for some reason, so it's not too late to switch to QQQ and for the gamblers TQQQ while they are relatively affordable, especially for options, and switch now.\n\nFed is already moving the pump level down the rally isn't happening again, SPY is now in correction.\n\nOtherwise those who are holding calls hoping for a rebound will be getting those EBT checks after your life saving go poof. ;)", "created_utc": 1588801897.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/getfp7/its_not_to_late_to_switch_from_spy_to_qqq_for/", "is_self": true}
