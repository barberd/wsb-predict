{"id": "di55hj", "title": "DCF model help Please", "selftext": " \n\nHi all\n\nTrying to create a DCF model here for an australian company. I am just wondering is it necessary to show D&amp;A expenses on an Income statment ? The reason I ask this is because on that company's annual report D&amp;A is nowhere to be found on their income statement(or maybe i couldn't reconcile them based on the line items that they have) however for me to complete my DCF model I feel like I will need to have the D&amp;A showing on the income statement so the three statement model will flow perfectly. Any thoughts ?", "created_utc": 1571130229, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/di55hj/dcf_model_help_please/", "is_self": true}
