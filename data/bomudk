{"id": "bomudk", "title": "Short tendies to make tendies??? WING", "selftext": "Wingstop stock (WING) has increased nearly 450% over the last three and a half years. The company has been successful in increasing their total number of stores yoy as well as increasing revenues. They currently sit at a $2.3 billion market cap with 2018 revenues at $153 million. 2018 net income was $21.7 million. Payments due at eoy 2019 amount to $21.5 million with an additional $345.4 million due by 2023. Current assets sit at $140 million with a total debt of $320 million. The only time the companies quick ratio has been over 1 was in 2015 from the cash boost of their ipo. Current cash and cash equivalents sits at $12.5 million. Free cash flow per share is ($5.54). Book value sits at ($7.67) a share. PE has hovered above 100 for some time now. This company seems extremely overvalued to me but the street doesn't seem to think so given the price movement. BLMN brands (arrabba's Italian Grill, Bonefish Grill, and Fleming's Prime Steakhouse &amp; Wine Bar) currently brings in $4.1 billion in revenue with an adjusted net income of $141 million. BLMN also has 236 more restaurants and 93,000 employees to WING's 416. Yet BLMN's market cap sits at only $1.86 billion. Restaurants are highly elastic and very competitive. Is there something i'm not seeing? The difficulty seems to be timing the top because the price moves irrationally. Any thoughts? \n\ndisclaimer: am retard", "created_utc": 1557859615, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bomudk/short_tendies_to_make_tendies_wing/", "is_self": true}
