At the very least dividends from their stocks could entice my Grandpa to invest in it. \n\nWhile their recent interactions with Elliot Management have been perceived as troublesome and a \u201cwin\u201d for their activist agenda they own less than 3% of shares outstanding and more or less have an immaterial effect on decisions made by the board. Great they have 1 fucking board seat now. They exit of the CEO was something that Elliot more than likely knew before hand and they are wanting to use this moment  as a PR stunt to show off their \u201cprowess.\u201d\n\nIn general AT&amp;T has been declining in price due to a misread analysis from factors like Elliot or their current debt levels; but the market has yet to fully price in the effectiveness of their strategies to spin off divisions not integral to the firm\u2019s profitability, competitive strategies and general market power.\n\nWhile they have sky high amounts of debt from the acquisition of Warner media they have been steadily paying it off and 2020 should see a drastic decrease in their overall debt levels, according to their internal reports and press releases.\n\nWhile their new challenge is a duo from both $DIS and the $S and $TMUS merger AT&amp;T has at least addressed the first issue they face with Disney: user cyclicality which is to say when GoT was running they saw a bump in subscriptions however once it ended they saw a net loss. They are however countering this with new shows set to run immediately after  block busters like GoT (I.e. GoT to Succession to Silicon Valley).\n\nAs for the merger AT&amp;T already has dominate market share and provides an all in one package between cell, land, cable and internet. While this strategy is likely to change it will only emphasize their programs such as out in California to build 5G networks for the state (literally being paid to build a massive network with bandwidth and wavelengths that rival that of AM/FM and current first responder equipment. It can pass through concrete better than current routes). The caveat to this project being first responders get priority of traffic on these airwaves in times of emergency (basically getting paid to have a PR boost with one of the first 5G networks in the US). So if an emergency happened like the wildfires they would face short term risk from mouth breathers unfamiliar with their business model or the tech; would not see the kind of effects like $PGE.\n\nWith all this being said I\u2019m a big believer in their slight pivots being made as they are not acts of desperation nor competitive actions for competitions sake (*coughs* APPLE TV+ *coughs*).\n\nWould say that calls for January 2021 or Q4 2020 could be solid plays despite their costs to enter into those contracts.\n\n(Full disclosure I own shares of AT&amp;T and want this bastard up; and I will also cite the information ASAP. Left my notes at work on their most recent statements/releases).", "created_utc": 1573892875, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dx4ams/att_to_the_moon_in_20202021_dd/", "is_self": true}
