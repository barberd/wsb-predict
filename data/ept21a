Why they are better positioned than TSLA, AAPL, GOOG is anyone's guess. \n\nThey are offering a desperation Lyft Pink play for 15% off rides and are significantly reducing driver pay as of this week -&gt; my Lyft driver today literally said 80% of drivers in Charlotte are switching to solely Uber and he's only using Lyft because no one was hailing a ride. In fact, he told me it's so bad that our trip over 12 miles he would LOSE money on, and indicated that only way it's worth is if I pay his LLC through square the shite after discount rate Lyft is charging. \n\nAlso, Lyft Pink being coupled with Chase Sapphire Reserve (along w/ other perks) to increase the cards fee to 550/yr is causing HUGE backlash with sentiment being that CSR customers will cancel. -&gt; further proving how useless this \"perk\" is that's the only way Lyft can profit by scheming a fake SAAS model w/ monthly fees that barely even reduce cost ($8 instead of $9 for a short trip)\n\nTldr: stonks always go up, but this one would need a Lyft..
