Both backed by by the reptilian overlord Bill Gates.\n\nNow that he has all the time in the world to focus on \"philanthropy\" since stepping down from his board seats, I bet there is something big in the pipeline. The U.S Army has just signed a contract with GILD to provide the experimental treatment. You can argue that it's \"PrIcEd In BrO\" but nothing is for sure in this fuck show clown world market we are seeing.\n\n21/AUG GILD 75 CALLS. \n\nBuy puts if you think they will lose the race to a vaccine or treatment.", "created_utc": 1584317338.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjbgdt/gilead_sciences_gild_and_inovio_pharmaceuticals/", "is_self": true}
