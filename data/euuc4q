The thing we get too much of? \"WAH WHY DID MY CALLS GO DOWN WHEN THE STOCK WENT UP?\"\n\nSo here's a cliff notes crash course in earnings season:\n\n**VOLATILITY MAKES OPTIONS OVERPRICED**\n\nNow for the actual explanation.\n\nMy fellow autists, I'd like you to imagine with me that the options market is a casino. Buying long calls is a sucker's game. Those people are like the idiot frat boy who spews up after either losing everything or winning big on a roulette wheel which he then promptly loses by letting it ride. Funny as shit. Not very gains porn.\n\nThe people who are buying call options weeks out? Those are the craps players. They make a few points and the dealer pushes a big pile of chips their way. They're smart but they're playing the game well even if it's rigged.\n\nTechnical analysis guys? They're blackjack players who think they can count cards but it turns out all the casinos use auto shufflers and won't go use a single shoe for anything less than $50,000 hand and even then they demand to use 8 packs.\n\nLet's talk about the one motherfucker that's making money in this situation. The casino.\n\nShort spreads. Now I know what you're thinking. What pussy shit is this autist bringing into WSB? Ban him. But I want to show you how we can have our YOLO and see more gains porn too. How? We YOLO buying power to the absolute fucking max instead of going for shitty unlimited gains.\n\nTake TSLA right now for example. Sitting around $555ish. Volatility through the fucking roof. Buying a call? Over three fucking grand for an ATM call and you won't get breakeven until $590. What kind of shit is that? If that were a bookie you'd shoot him in the kneecaps for ripping you off on odds yet every day, people take these shitty bets when the gains aren't even that great.\n\nWhat we're going to do instead is stretch that buying power. We're gonna load up our YOLO shorts. 1/31 562.5/570 short put spread @ $4.33. Somewhere around 5/8 true odds. Pays out 4/3. How much BP does it use? $750 lousy fucking bucks. You can sell 4 of these fuckers for every call you could buy. Max profit is $433. You sell four of those you're sitting on $1700 if TSLA stays above about $565. If it goes below, you're out $1200. So you've lost less money that you would with that shitty call too so you can keep playing instead of walking away from the table.\n\nYou know how much it would take the stock to move on a $3.3K call to make the same money? Over $607.\n\nIt's a risky move but we make it smart and we make +150% return on capital if we hit it big. And that's just if we sit in the 40s of probability. We can go further ITM and pick up riskier odds and much higher ROC if TSLA goes moon but even when we play shitty odds we'll still be in a better position than buying calls because we're the fucking casino and we get paid what we deserve when we hit those odds.\n\nWe can play more trades, better trades, more gains, more YOLOs, more gains porn. WSB can be great again. Fuck unlimited gains. Fuck long calls. Maxing out that buying power with as much risk as you can take is the true way to YOLO tendies.", "created_utc": 1580158850, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/euuc4q/we_need_better_yolos_i_want_to_show_you_the_way/", "is_self": true}
