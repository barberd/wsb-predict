I would be glad to answer as many questions about the industry if it would be helpful to sellside and buyside people on Reddit that are looking for honest answers. For my background, assume target undergraduate school, decent banks, and very large platform hedge funds as experience. I ran a PnL also and can talk about what works and what does not work if people care about that.\n\nTruth: I have a startup that is undergoing redesign and was hoping to use the AMA to help raise awareness for the website (it is a healthy, excellent, functioning business, not some PoS t-shirt company). Feel free to \"hit the bid\" on this AMA idea or tell me to \"stop shitting the bed\" below if this AMA seems irrelevant and not useful to people here.\n\nThis post is somewhat shitty, so I don't know the correct flair.", "created_utc": 1557955802, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bp3vdj/testing_the_waters_would_anyone_here_care_for_a/", "is_self": true}
