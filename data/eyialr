I been off this joint for a minute but at work today I overheard some millennials talking about TSLA being upper than their dads dingus. The last time I heard kids talking like that, it was when butt coin was at 19k and all of them thinking they were gonna be the next jimmy buffet.\nNow, big dingus daddy here has the 8th top post on this sub. I've been around these parts for a minute. I was here when AMD was at 13 and everyone was eating Lisa Su's big fuzz. I don't play tag.. I've been it. I'm coming out of retirement to make these chumps into my personal playmates. I've got 50 G's to yolo tomorrow on straight up TSLA calls. Here's what I'm thinking..\n\nEither\n\nJune 19th $1000 Strike (all in)\n\nMay 15 $950 Strike (all in)\n\nMar 20 $900 Strike (all in)\n\nFeb 7 $840Strike (all in)\n\nI've been selling covered calls on MU for the past year, collecting a few G's every month because I retired from the YOLO game.
