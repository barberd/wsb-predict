{"id": "g50x3h", "title": "Why I bought USO and Why did you idiots buy puts at 200% IVOL", "selftext": "Bought into USO today. Holding 100 Shares. Will never close it. My strategy for this is to sell OTM covered calls against it for the next 4 weeks and hopefully turn this into free shares that can sit in my portfolio. Vol is stupid high on these calls and puts. COLLECT when vol is high...\n\nI saw some really weird comments surrounding the oil crash. Regardless about direction - Why do you guys continue to do this\n\n\\- BUY to open contracts that sit at 200% IMPV\n\nWhen USO sits at 4$ for a month you're going to say goodbye to your premium.  The ETF is literally dirt cheap fucking short it like a man if you really have a bias. #theta\n\nWanted to share my chart for anyone into that sort of thing\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/0wkX7et](https://imgur.com/a/0wkX7et)\n\n[https://www.barrons.com/articles/brent-brodeski-steering-a-major-ria-through-a-crisis-51587135858](https://www.barrons.com/articles/brent-brodeski-steering-a-major-ria-through-a-crisis-51587135858)\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimcollins/2020/04/20/the-us-oil-etf-uso-is-the-culprit-behind-oils-massive-plunge/#35ce59fe24e8](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimcollins/2020/04/20/the-us-oil-etf-uso-is-the-culprit-behind-oils-massive-plunge/#35ce59fe24e8)\n\nEDIT:\n\nThis is not a post on direction! I just can't understand why you guys are buying PUTS at 200%... just short the fucking thing and don't deal with time decay or do combos to lock in that risk and collect premium.
