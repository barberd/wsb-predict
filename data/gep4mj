{"id": "gep4mj", "title": "The Cramer inverse tactic", "selftext": "Hello fellow autists, I had the beautiful idea to inverse all of Cramer\u2018s trades in a paper trading account to see where this would go:\n\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gefb6o/cramer_pushed_oil_shorts_prior_to_the_legendary/fpn6qkt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\n\n\nBut I\u2019m somehow stuck right now, so we have to discuss a few things/rules first:\n\n\n1. Is there a broker/trading platform that offers enough paper money of course and FREE real-time quotes? If yes, which one? If no, alternatives?\n\n\n2. What exactly is inversing? If he says to go long, buy puts and other way around? When he says \u201ebuy calls\u201c sell calls instead? Gonna need some clarification here for true inversing.\n\n\n3. Contract sizes, strike prices and expiration?\n\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your ideas on this project since i\u2019m planning to create daily posts everyday after close to see how we\u2019re doing.\n\n\ncheers", "created_utc": 1588788369.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gep4mj/the_cramer_inverse_tactic/", "is_self": true}
