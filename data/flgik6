Went right back into PUTS, prolly gonna exit tomorrow some time before the witching rally (hope it isnt this already!)\n\nTimes are in CEST, so its minus 5 hours for you guys\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/926fs1zuoon41.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=62331bb5d06e41825b9f4dea1ff11eafd5090f18", "created_utc": 1584647587.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flgik6/10k_100_in_less_than_2_hours_for_timing_the_press/", "is_self": true}
