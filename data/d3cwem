{"id": "d3cwem", "title": "Uber and Lyft\u2019s reaction to AB5", "selftext": "So AB 5 passed both the senate and the house, what\u2019s next?\n\n- it will likely be signed by the Governor as he recently wrote an Op-Ed in support. \n- Uber and Lyft still won\u2019t designate drivers as employees. A small group of drivers will file lawsuit and likely settle after a few years. Cities and the state will sue and Uber and Lyft will tie them up in court. \n- Uber, DoorDash and Lyft will likely file a ballot initiative to implement the exclusions they want. This process will go until end of 2020. \n- Uber and Lyft file lawsuit likely win a stay on the bill while ballot initiative is going through its process. \n- wouldn\u2019t be surprised by the feds somehow stepping in and superseding AB5, I just don\u2019t see how yet. \n\nBy the way:\n\n- No way does a union happen at least within the next 5 years, and not without lots of sectoral bargaining legislation passing next year (isn\u2019t going to happen). \n\nMy bet is long term, we\u2019ll see a \u201cdependent contractor\u201d status in most sectors that are dependent on immigrant labor. \n\nI\u2019ve been working in this world for a bit, would be happy to answer questions you might have, and I\u2019m interested in your perspective on how to play it. I\u2019ve lost enough money trying to guess Uber/Lyft investors reactions to news.", "created_utc": 1568316042, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d3cwem/uber_and_lyfts_reaction_to_ab5/", "is_self": true}
