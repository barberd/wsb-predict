{"id": "fi6747", "title": "I am Taiwanese, USA has fucked up this time. Everywhere in the world has already recognized virus issue and is spending effort on containing and treatment. USA now only begin to make test kit?", "selftext": "As title,\n\nThis virus shit is not easy to combat. Taiwan even had government coordinated multiple mask production line set up 2 months ago. We manufacture more mask every week than what USA had in inventory right now.\n\nThis bull shit speech is hopeless, Trump has just now moved from denial to recognition with beginning virus test. So fucking late compared to the rest of the world\u2019s virus combating effort. \n\nThere is 3 main tasks. \n1. Test\n2. Contain\n3. Cure\n\nUSA did none. And is about to start 1...\n\nMost country are doing quarantine first to all incoming individuals. Then test anyone with suspicious symptoms. \n\nNEVER BAN/CLOSE CERTAIN ROUTES of travel. (Europe Ban). This makes boarder control supper difficult. It is close to impossible to flag potential high contagious individuals if they find their way from other travel route.\n\nAs of now, they are proposing drive through test?(\uff0a\u00b4\u0434\uff40)?? \n\nThey really should take a look in Taiwan on how we perform test. It is full contained isolation between medical personnel and patient.\n\nThis stupid almighty test plan is gonna create widespread cases.\n\nWorst of all, general American are stupid as fuck to not wear mask. (Although USA will never have enough of mask for everyone daily).\n\nTL;DR; SPY PUTs next Wednesday. USA seems to be lagging the global trends. That\u2019s why market does not make sense today.\n\nIt will make sense later and dive down next week. Just like Donnie tends to be late. Our PUTs tendies will arrive later this month.", "created_utc": 1584131163.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fi6747/i_am_taiwanese_usa_has_fucked_up_this_time/", "is_self": true}
