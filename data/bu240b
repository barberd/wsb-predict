If you are reading this it means it worked. Here's the morning run down on BYND from today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBYND blackout period for analyst coverage is over. Some thought the price targets would be horrendous since the stock is super overvalued. Turns out bankers like money (who knew?) so they aren't submarining their own successful IPO.
