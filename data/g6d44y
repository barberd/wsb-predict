Now everyone was saying 4/20 had to be green but it ended up being red because the market is doing the inverse of anything logical. Therefore, it would make sense that 4/24 would also be red. However, because of the inverse rule, 4/24 will actually end up bigly green.\n\nTL:DR: 4/24 300c SPY", "created_utc": 1587602648.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6d44y/friday_424_will_100_be_a_green_day_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
