Say it with me, retard.\n\n**Being early is the same as being wrong.**\n\nFor the past three weeks I\u2019ve heard on repeat: \u201cI\u2019m not wrong, I\u2019m just early.\u201d Newsflash retard, they\u2019re the same. Especially when you buy FDs.\n\nOut of all of WSB, the people who make the most money off the impending drop won\u2019t be the TA autist SV cult bear gang (disclaimer: am one of them). It won\u2019t be the bulls chanting BRRRR as S&P rips to 4000 next week, only to have the rug ripped from under them right as the last r/all stoolie buys his first calls with mommy\u2019s allowance. It won\u2019t even be theta gang preying off tards YOLOing their life savings into 220 puts (e.g. yours truly) trying to catch that inverse rising knife, saying \u201cit can\u2019t go any higher, this has to be the top.\u201d\n\nNo. It will be **cash gang**. The buzzards who sit on the sidelines and wait, and once the downtrend and the real panic starts, HOMO into puts. Yes, the HOMOs will win. Why?\n\nBecause **being early is the same as being wrong**.  Because by the time you\u2019re right, you\u2019re still down 90% on your investment. The HOMOs will be late, but they will be buying in before you break even, with all the more buying power to do so.\n\nTL;DR: Don\u2019t be afraid to be HOMO. Better to be gay with cash than have dildos up your ass (which is pretty gay anyway).", "created_utc": 1586547212.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fymwsu/being_early_is_the_same_as_being_wrong/", "is_self": true}
