{"id": "g96289", "title": "How is the Fed fucking my puts? Read in Vinnie's voice.", "selftext": "OK fucknuggests, it's story time but before we begin, a few pointers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* There is no Technical Analysis in this post, it is all fundamentals\n* It assumes most of you fucks, like me 10 minutes ago, don't know how the Fed works\n* The title is misleading; I actually believe the major indexes are going to correct, possibly down to 1700 for the SPX and 4800 for FTSE but..here is why I might be wrong\n* This is not your average printer go Brrr meme (which actually makes me want to tear out my fucking eyeballs)\n\n**If you are a rainbow bear; why are you writing a post about it mooning to 3500?**\n\nBecause I am retarded but I am not *totally* retarded.   I have said in other posts; the best thing you can do to stretch yourself (and not your asshole) is to write.  Write down your opinions.  Write down your assumptions.  Write down your predictions.  You can revisit it months or years later to see how you developed or lost all of your rent money on TSLA calls to 1400.\n\nI am writing this post to show all of the ways I might be wrong.  I suggest you do the same.\n\n# First of all.  This is how the money works.\n\nIf you watch this video by successful autist Ray Dalio, you will see that in [credit is money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0)*.*  It is that simple.  When someone issues credit to someone else they are issuing them the license to spend money.  Now, since we have for more credit in the system than we have physical money; that normally means your simply moving credit around from balance sheets.   Your employer moves credit from their balance sheet to your bank account balance sheet and you can buy chicken tendies and then you move some of the credit to your moms balance sheet so she can afford STI treatments.\n\nTherefore, it stands to reason that **we can increase the money supply in existence by providing more credit and we can contract the money supply in existence by removing credit.**\n\nWhilst we have lots of institutions that can extend credit to someone; **only one can invent new credit**.  A Central Bank. Everyone else is constrained by various laws and stuff like that.  AMEX cannot just invent more AMEX bucks.  They need a credit line from a bank and that bank needs a credit line from another bank and so on...until, like all rivers run to the sea; we end up at a Central Bank.  The Fed. Or BoJ.  or ECB. Or BOE etc.\n\nThese banks are supposed to be independent of the Government so some retard like Trump cannot hoover a bag of wasabi snoot candy and fuck around with the money supply to ensure a second term.\n\nSupposedly.\n\n# How does a Central Bank issue credit?\n\nGreat fucking question autist.  That is the important part.\n\nThey have issued *credit* and central banks worldwide have allowed banks to relax their requirement to hold reserves of cash.  That injects money into the business world by allowing lending and borrowing to continue.  It also reduces *theoretical* risk since the models are back within tolerance.\n\nWhen the time comes they will *remove the credits* gradually without causing hyperinflation.  They do this by paying banks not to lend back into the system by holding a % of their assets at the Federal Reserve.  So they pay the banks but the banks keep the deposit at the Fed and don't pass on the liquidity to potential borrowers..gradually and sustainably.\n\n**Supposedly.**\n\nRead this fucking link if you do nothing else:   [https://www.aier.org/article/powells-new-monetary-regime/](https://www.aier.org/article/powells-new-monetary-regime/)\n\nThey FED purchase the security initially to then sell it back later. So the balance of credit-deficit merely swaps but by paying a small premium on the excesses that they hold, they can cushion the inflation or deflation of the currency.\n\nSo, they effectively give the bank liquidity and then remove that liquidity later by passing the liability back...but also provide a small premium to cushion the blow; 50% of the premium is then held on Federal Reserve books so that the market is not flooded with new money.\n\nThe FED previously reduced their balance sheet [from $4.4 trillion to $3.7 trillion](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WALCL) but it remains to be seen if they can unwind a position of this size.\n\n# What the fuck fuckity fuck does this have to do with the S&P?\n\nFirst of all, anyone that tries to tell you the S&P is rising because\n\n>***It iS MaiNLy tEch!!1!!***\n\nPunch them in the fucking balls.  Amazon is not a tech company; it is a consumer discretionary and Alphabet and Facebook are considered Communications.  But, more importantly;  **ALL indexes have risen**.  From the USA to Europe to the Far East.  **They are all rising; not just SPX**.  So, quick haymaker to the baby makers for those autists trying to say that AMZN earnings are stopping the index dropping.\n\n# So why is it rising?\n\nThe newly issued credit from Central Banks is going looking for **Return on Investment.**  That is why.  It is flowing like the salmon of Capistrano into equities because to put it anywhere else would be madness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>We got not food, we got no jobs, our pets HEADS ARE FALLING OFF!! But the Dow Jones is doing brilliantly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo to make a prediction you need to pick up your skirt, grab your fucking balls and decide whether you are an anti-American bear or a dickhead bull.  You need to decide whether; the central banks of the work truly can bridge the gap to 2021 or 2022 or whether the rising inflation and the pandemic effects will punt JPow right in the cunt.\n\nHaha joke.  JPow will be fine.  It will be the working class being dropkicked in the beef curtains.\n\nThat means the borrower of the future (home purchasers, entreprenuers etc) will have very few credit facilities available so RIP to the long-term economic growth and the prices of things go up making it even worse.\n\n# Quick Mafs\n\n**Model 1**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* 2019 SP500 earnings were $163\n* 2020, assume half of '19 earnings ($82)\n* 2021, a 50% increase from '20 ($122)\n* 2022, we recover to 2019 earnings ($163)\n* Assume an aggregate 7% cost of capital and a 2% growth rate (i.e. a 20x multiple on our 2022 earnings)\n\n*If you do all that you get a discounted* ***value of 2,800+ for the SP500.***  *Fucking tendy party for everyone. Fed has saved the day.  Trump re-elected, everyone gets a free bleach vaccine and booster shot of UV up the asshole.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Model 2**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The earnings in 2022 do recover to $163. \n* Aggregate 8% cost of capital\n* 1% growth rate, giving a multiple of about 14X.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*This would give the* ***discounted value of 1,800+ for the SP500.***   *We will all be living on fried squirrel bits and drinking Nuka cola remembering the good old days.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Anything else?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEV/Trailing 12m Sales for the S&P 500 has averaged (both mean and median) about 2.0x since 1990.\n\nIt currently stands at 2.4x, which is much closer to the all-time high of 3.0x hit during the technology bubble in 1999 than the Great Financial Crisis low of 1.2x.\n\nAlso, bond markets aren\u2019t really functional, since they are being bought by Central banks who are bid only. In relatively illiquid bond markets this has a huge impact. The USA may as well rename itself the USSA when it comes to free markets.\u00a0  \n\n\nDefensive stocks could also be seen as a haven from inflation, which seems more likely in the long run given all the stimulus out there.  \n\n\nThere is a saying that ***a good recession always finds a way of robbing people of their money.*** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# My My How the Turntables.  What else should we know?\n\n**The total assets owned by the Fed is about 10% of the total combined US equity and fixed income market caps**. That seems like enough to influence the price, but not set it.\n\n**The primary lever is the Fed\u2019s narrative for the markets, not their purchases.**\n\n# Super low interest rates and massive stimulus lead to no or negative growth\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* If companies are using 0% interest rates to take out loans and then transferring those loans to a small 1% of the populace via dividends; that bill will come due to the citizen taxpayer and/or shareholder of the future\n* If companies are taking federal or governmental aid to furlough workers but still paying dividends to shareholders? That bill will come due to the citizen taxpayer and effectively is an even more extreme form of socialising market losses; **it means that we truly can never have a correction since the top 1% will lose...**\n* Not lose the investment itself, which can rebound, but will **simply lose the yield on an investment and only for a short period of time**. **If we have reached a point where that is considered unacceptable then we truly are living in a new socialist, centrally planned world.**\n* Here is [Tesco defending their decision](https://www.ft.com/content/4719c92c-ab17-4852-92e6-533c682611f4) today of \u00a3635m in dividends...despite receiving considerable amounts of VAT, Rates and Rental relief from the UK Government (\u00a3585m)...they have done an admirable job and are profitable but this market signal and their stated *reasons* for doing so are alarming.\n\n>CEO said 'every pound we receive \\[in rates relief\\] will be invested in ensuring Tesco is able to support British shoppers...' That is tax payers paying a subsidy to a free-market company for the ability to shop...**and also...**Mr Lewis said that the **needs of savers and pension funds also needed to be considered in the debate around dividends**.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve thought long and hard about our responsibilities here\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009we are in a strong position to pay out for the benefit of those people\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL:DR**  There is no TL;DR, go fuck yourself.  There is a lot to take in so snort in small lines and try not to pull a Mia Wallace.\n\nActually there is a TL;DR.   Is there anywhere attractive to park QE money?   No, stick it in equities. \n\n**Positions**:  Short major indexes, SPX to 1700, Long VIX to 70 within 6 months", "created_utc": 1588011189.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g96289/how_is_the_fed_fucking_my_puts_read_in_vinnies/", "is_self": true}
