{"id": "cvqb5h", "title": "$SIX Yearly pump time", "selftext": "It\u2019s that time of heat again fellas. $SIX releases their annual ride reports for the upcoming year at the end of August. Following the advice of a fellow WSBetter last year I made over $6,000. He basically pointed out that going back over the five year chart of six flags they always dip in the months leading up to August, then spike at the end of the month due to the upcoming rides report and continue to rally through September and October. I followed this advice last year and it treated me well. Bought Calls back in April and a few weeks ago and they are both trending upwards each day., with SIX being up 16% over the last month.Who wants to join on this tendie train with me?", "created_utc": 1566836626, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cvqb5h/six_yearly_pump_time/", "is_self": true}
