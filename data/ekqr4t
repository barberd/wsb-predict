{"id": "ekqr4t", "title": "$SDS is the poor-man's $SPY", "selftext": "$SH is literally an ETF for $SHorting SPY - **$SPY goes down, $SH goes up.** Simple as that.\n\nThe same company runs another EFT called **$SDS**. This is, you guessed it, the SPY Double $SHort. It's just **$SH with a 2x multiplier**. Unsurprisingly, there are more options available for $SDS than $SH.\n\nBut because people suck at pricing options, **$SDS puts are way cheaper than $SPY calls**, and vice-versa. For example, as I'm writing this (2am Eastern on Jan 6 2020):\n\nJan 10 **SDS PUT** for $24.00 is $0.04. That's 3.10% OTM for **$0.04**.\n\nJan 10 **SPY CALL** for $237.5 is $0.20. That's 1.55% OTM for **$0.20**.\n\nThese two options are equivalent, but the SDS PUT is cheaper. Sure, the bid is currently $0.00, but even at the ask price of $0.08, the **$SDS PUT is less than half the cost of a regular $SPY call**.\n\nThis is true for most OTM SPY/SDS option pairs. But when either option goes ITM, **$SDS gains 2x the amount of intrinsic value, since it's a double-short of SPY**. Exercising the SDS option is better, provided there's volume, and SDS avarages 4 million shares/day. That makes up for the lower number of available contracts for SDS, especially since poor autists can't afford that many contracts in the first place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR - Too poor for SPY calls? Buy SDS puts. Too poor for SPY puts? Buy SDS calls.**", "created_utc": 1578296083, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ekqr4t/sds_is_the_poormans_spy/", "is_self": true}
