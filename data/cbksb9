{"id": "cbksb9", "title": "BYND is at Costco DD", "selftext": "Costco is now carrying Beyond Burgers. I don't see this in any press releases by either Costco or BYND. There was a vegan blog that mentioned this information (it was brought to my attention by [**relevant\\_pet\\_bug**](https://www.reddit.com/user/relevant_pet_bug)) and I called the stores to confirm it. The item # is 1338620. It is in approximately 15 stores nationwide. A store in San Diego has it for sure, 2345 Fenton Parkway, and the Costco on 1890 S University Drive in Davie, Florida has it. I don't know the other 13 stores. When I called a purchasing manager in the regional area to find out why the stores only carried a limited supply of the Beyond Burgers, he said that Costco would buy as many Beyond Burgers as they could get their hands on, but that BYND only sold a limited amount because they couldn't keep up with demand. He said that Beyond Burgers are selling really well and they are selling out in \"just a few days\". Apparently, BYND will be installing new manufacturing lines by the end of 2018 to to increase supply and supposedly they will be able to provide Costco nationwide with Beyond Burgers by next year. \n\nI asked why Costco would sell Beyond Burgers when they already sell Morning Star and Don Lee Farm's Veggie Burgers and the purchasing manager said that Beyond Burgers just taste different and customers want them. AGAIN: This man is responsible for buying items for Costco in a large region of the US and he said that they would buy as many BYND Burgers as they could, but that supply was limited and that they will stock Beyond Burgers nationwide once BYND can meet demand in early 2019. This is hugely positive news and I don't see any news reports about it or analyst reports mentioning it (please let me know if I am wrong!)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPhotos taken from other groups about it: [https://imgur.com/a/FcalTI9](https://imgur.com/a/FcalTI9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf any reporters want my sources for this story feel free to PM me. \n\nI want to thank u/[**relevant\\_pet\\_bug**](https://www.reddit.com/user/relevant_pet_bug) for pointing me in the right direction and bringing the vegan blog post, where this was first mentioned, to my attention.", "created_utc": 1562784911, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cbksb9/bynd_is_at_costco_dd/", "is_self": true}
