No mate none of the ones you are looking for to see a drop. \n\n4 and 8 EMA is my badboy and they have not crossed. (But you know, whatever MA your into. I don't judge) \n\n  \n  And only now are we even getting close to any real resistance. \n\n  \n  That fuckers going to come down, and Ill be buying me some Puts.
