Right now Netflix is undervalued and should go back up. If you wanna join me on my retarded way to get my money back I shall welcome you as my brother/sister in arm on the road of delicious tendies. If you chose to join me be careful, cause it might still go a bit down, but I expect it to be close to the bottom and get stonks either today or somewhere next week. As for anything else, you should go and research yourself and not rely on my cause I am retarded.
