I went on a trip to Nestl\u00e9 recently because I'm a student interested in their graduate program. I got lost, and ended up walking past the nearby Cargill factory and took a mental note of how close it was to Nestl\u00e9. \n\nWhile at the Nestl\u00e9 factory, I asked the person giving the tours if they get their chocolate from Cargill. She said no, and pointed out the window to where they were making Smarties and Kit-Kats - but then I was a little clearer about what I meant, and I asked where they manufacture the chocolate itself - not just where they assemble the final product. She was little less confident, but still assured me that it's made onsite... somewhere.\n\nTurns out Nestl\u00e9 and Cargill are currently being investigated for working together + turning a blind eye to child/slave labour in Ivory Coast. I'm still gunna eat their chocolate, but I think this is interesting for obvious reasons.\n\nCargill is a privately owned American Company. The Cargill family are stupid rich. Both Cargill and Nestl\u00e9 bonds are eligible for the UKs Bank of Englands Bond Buying Program - meaning that the UK can print money to loan these companies money (in a very round-about way). \n\nI have a HSBC Bank account. The overdraft fee for my account will go up to 40% soon. i.e. my bank will let me accidentally spend more money than I have, but with charge me 40% interest for the privilege. For a lot of people, this is up from 10%. I am a student, so for me, the overdraft facility is free (until it isn't) - and this free overdraft was one of the main reasons I choose HSBC when I was 18. \n\nThe UK's Bank Rate is 0.75 - below is inflation target. It's supposed to be this low to encourage other interest rates to fall which in theory would help to facilitate economic activity.", "created_utc": 1575756234, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e7kouw/ive_been_high_for_100hrs_straight_im_so_confused/", "is_self": true}
