{"id": "c6o8fw", "title": "BYND Short Interest and Borrow Rate Update", "selftext": "S3 back from vacation and posted this update: \n\nBYND short interest is $883 mm; 5.42 mm shares shorted; 46.27% of float; 132% borrow fee. Shs shorted are up +11k, +0.20%, in June as its stock price rose +56.46%. Over the past week shs shorted decreased by -162k, -2.90%, as its stock price rose +0.34%.\n\nNew Borrows are charging 100-150% today. According to S3, of stocks with more than $50m in short interest, BYND has the highest borrow rate. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5.42m shares shorted of a float of 11m. This is down slightly from a few days ago when it was 5.94m. The avg short borrow rate of 132% is up slightly from 115% on June 25th. However new borrows are getting charged 100-150%, well below the borrow rate of 250-350%. He still sees short supply as tight and this is a lender's market. From what I've been seeing when I call around, borrow rates fell from yesterday's 200% range to today around 122%. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo probably the run up this week was a mini-squeeze. A true squeeze would see the shares shorted fall by probably 10-20% on an absolute basis. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOther BYND news: Famous Dave's (DAVE) has 136 locations and they are trialing BYND in 5 of them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm still holding my August calls. I want to see what getting added to the Russell 1000 index does for the stock next week. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHave a good weekend everyone!", "created_utc": 1561748827, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c6o8fw/bynd_short_interest_and_borrow_rate_update/", "is_self": true}
