I know this sub isn\u2019t into silver the boomer play but hear me out.\n\nAG just announced a 10 million share buyback over the next year. https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/news/3552852-first-majestic-renews-stock-buyback-program-for-up-to-10m-shares\n\nNo silver bullion dealer is selling silver bullion under $17 a ounce. Check for yourself. Current silver prices are not being honored.\n\nMining stocks took the biggest beating. AG bottomed at about $4 and had a quick reversal going past 6\n\nReally looks like all mining stocks seen capitulation and starting a new phase.\n\nIf you\u2019re into indicators it had a mean reversal on a sequential 9. This can be a good bottom indicator. Dow is on one today. I\u2019m guessing this is a short term bottom for the market.", "created_utc": 1584542050.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkqg0r/ag_calls/", "is_self": true}
