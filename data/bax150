{"id": "bax150", "title": "April Fools Update: WSB mod count surpasses r/Science, puts r/ModLimit out of business, #1 on Reddit.", "selftext": "https://i.imgur.com/vC2BvCP.jpg\n\nBy law, WSB is now the best subreddit, with over 2,000 mods, we are officially the #1 subreddit by mod count.\n\n ...but we're just getting started. There's still another 80,000+ redditors to invite. \n\nWe couldn't have done this without you. Thank you to everyone who commented and upvoted the original post.\n\nA very special thank you goes out to u/The_White_Light, for writing the script to invite mods. If you see him in the comments, please give him a big thanks.\n\nI was initially doing it by hand, but after about 300, I figured that there had to be a better way that did not involve me getting carpal tunnel.\n\n---\n\n#FAQ\n\nQ: Are you really going to mod 85,000 people?\n\nA: Honestly, we were going to ban everyone who posted in that thread... but there were just so many of you.\n\n---\n\nQ: Where's my invitation!?!\n\nA: Reddit has hard limits on how moderators are invited. Specifically, there's a subreddit wide invitation limit of 100/hour, and 25 pending invitations at any one time. \n\nFor this reason, we've had to prioritize who gets invited to mod.\n\n---\n\nQ: Who gets prioritized first? \n\nA: It's based on a couple things, in order of importance:\n1. If you're subscribed to WSB\n2. Your most recent activity \n3. Count of positively rated comments/submissions on reddit.\n4. Overall karma amount\n\n---\n\nQ: I got a PM saying I was invited, but I can't accept!\n\nA: To make sure we can invite everyone, invitations expire after 15 minutes! Make sure you accept fast!\n\n---", "created_utc": 1554746785, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bax150/april_fools_update_wsb_mod_count_surpasses/", "is_self": true}
