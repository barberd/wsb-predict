{"id": "fbso81", "title": "Google trends - spot coronavirus infections before they are public", "selftext": "If you're interested in looking for where coronavirus infections may be popping up before they hit the press then you might find indications in Google Trends.\n\nTL:DR: Puts on life.\n\nMy theory is that people particular ill are going to be searching \"symptoms of coronavirus\" and that where these searches are higher than normal you're seeing, potentially, a lot more people who may have corona (or a local flu outbreak is going on). And you're going to see these trends play out well ahead of actual reporting and test results.\n\nEnter - [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=now%201-d&amp;geo=US&amp;q=symptoms%20of%20coronavirus). If you fiddle with Google Trends you can see where the search is popping up. I have set mine to past day on the timeframe, then changed the map to \"city\" and ticked the \"low search volume\" box. \n\n24 hours ago, the search results compared to the official CDC data.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v0u5a7ltm1k41.jpg?width=679&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6aa5acaa5240560a8f88a3a4d8be2c1f8f5714db\n\nI also did a comparison between searches for just \"coronavirus\" and the \"symptoms of coronavirus\" in order to try and weed out just a general high interest in the disease. This was 24 hours ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x3rvl83xm1k41.jpg?width=1144&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9e6e1894c675cbd2589da656e8d3e28aca69b96\n\nHere's searches from just now for \"symptoms of coronavirus\" over the past day.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ksbm0ht2n1k41.jpg?width=1147&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20cceaf2bb689655ed6a0cfb0ca884f2370c6e58\n\nAnd just now with the side-by side.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yzbi7un9n1k41.jpg?width=1145&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a633dc283394c1fa9c9b500bb572dc119fe4b98\n\nIf you're interested in having a look, try [trends.google.com](https://trends.google.com) yourself. When it gives you a state-by-state view you can click into a state or region and get more detail. Also, the score Google gives something is out of 100 - 100 being \"the largest number of searches in the set\" and 1 being the least. It's a relative scale, not absolute.\n\nCaveats: I'm not saying this is a *perfect* indicator but it *does* indicate outsized interest in a topic. Note how heavily the NW is represented - and sure enough, there's a lot of coronavirus news and patients there. Note how Florida was trending yesterday, and we're hearing today about testing and people being monitored and so-on.", "created_utc": 1583061120, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fbso81/google_trends_spot_coronavirus_infections_before/", "is_self": true}
