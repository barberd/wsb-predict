{"id": "euiusv", "title": "Coronavirus Market Effects Explained", "selftext": "A few of you have been asking about why this virus is affecting markets so badly so I'm gonna explain what I learned after a quick wikipedia search for econ 101.\n\nIn this world there are two types of people, Boomers and Brokers (and I'm not talking about RH here).\n\nBoomers are the ones who spend all the money and hoard all the money. They make the world go round. They keep the economy afloat. Brokers are the \"wagecucks\" living paycheck to paycheck. Basically, Brokers are the dispensable ones -- like us as we yolo on tesla and virgin galactic. \n\nNow, the problem is that this virus is targetting Boomers and not Brokers. You might be saying, \"but aren't all the chinese Brokers?\" but you'd be underestimating the vast amount of wealth that the chinese elite have built up over the past decade. I'm talking about venezuelan gold piles here. \n\nYou aren't seeing the Boomers throw their money into gold because instead they're legitimately in fear of getting rekt by mother nature. They are throwing all their money behind the search for immortality. It's china. There is a long history of the emperor searching for the key to immortality. CHinese new year? Throwback to the days of old. It's all coming full circle. Do you know what rats are good at doing? They are good at reproducing -- Thai prostitutes. Did you think it was just a coincidence that there are already 4 cases of the virus in Thailand? \n\nNow, boys, do you know what gives us the feeling of immortality? Drugs. Now, we can't go buying calls on meth here but we CAN gamble with the \"Devil's Lettuce\" if you know what I mean\n\ntl;dr $ACB CALLS BOYS THIS SHIP IS FINALLY GOING TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON!!!!", "created_utc": 1580099660, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/euiusv/coronavirus_market_effects_explained/", "is_self": true}
