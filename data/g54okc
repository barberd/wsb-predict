That leaves us with the problem of a flailing economy, high service industry unemployment and a need for a re-election.\n\nWar fixes a lot of things. Re-election of war time presidents is guaranteed. A common enemy you can see, infinite jobs and work to do means that the economy ramps up to high gear quickly. Wow - BA won a government contract for more planes, oil uncertainty makes supply chains riskier and local oil more profitable. IBM is contracted to process enemy data points and movements through DARPA funds.\n\nAll of this going on puts the pandemic, which people will be tired of talking about, on the backburner.\n\n\nSo - Where do we liberate? Two options: Iran and Venezuala. Iran 20%, Venezuela 80%.\n\nVenezuala we have the cover of one of our neighbor's being governed by a 'rogue' president and shipping drugs up through our southern border. Also fits the caravan narrative.:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuelan_presidential_crisis\n\nWe already have \"counter narco terrorism ships\" in place there:\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-52133500\n\nWho's invited to this dance? Probably Brazil:\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-brazil/brazil-pulls-diplomats-from-venezuela-embassy-idUSKBN20S2TS\n\nThis does a lot for both nations as it allows us to solidify American relations with Brazil and open them up as a trade ally, secure Venezuela's oil fields for ourselves and opens up two economies for the replacement of China's role in some of our importing. \n\nIt also means we don't step on the toes of Saudi Arabia and Russia with some nonsense in the Middle East. Less vested interests.\n\nWe have the precedent with Iran of pulling out of the nuclear deal, killing soleimani, and a strong ally in Saudi Arabia. Relations with SA are souring though, and there's a strong distaste for starting more shit in the sand.\n\nWhat are the plays? Wait for talk of 'second wave' to start in July or of drugs coming in from Venezuela to be on thew news nightly. Until then, oil tankers.
