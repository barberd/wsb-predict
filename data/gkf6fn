Anaysts at Wallstreet Bets supported this thesis because \"Trump really ain't gon do shit mis Beckie. he just loweing expectation's so dat maket go boom afterwads\". \n\nIn other news, Crude Oil WTI gained as much as 8% today because the price was too low, and Apple Stock plummeted as much as 1.5% because it was too high. \n\nThat's all for today folks, I'm Becky from Wallstreet Bets News and remember, \"Never bet against America\".", "created_utc": 1589569109.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gkf6fn/wsb_news_stock_markets_trend_slightly_higherlower/", "is_self": true}
