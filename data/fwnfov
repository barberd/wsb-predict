I know all you retards are either holding onto your puts with severe losses. There may be even some less retarded folk out there who actually have some ammo left, this post is for you. Stop buying puts on SPY and QQQ instead, buy puts in IWM. \n\nIWM has always underperformed SPY and QQQ during the good times, and always leads to the downside when the markets are crashing. The spreads are much friendlier as well for the smart folk placing their bets longer term. I'll be adding to my position as SPY goes to 278 and 293.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: IWM Nov 20 Put debit spread 115/105", "created_utc": 1586276634.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fwnfov/spyqqq_is_the_wrong_index_to_have_puts_in/", "is_self": true}
