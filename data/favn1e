{"id": "favn1e", "title": "Holding puts over the weekend?", "selftext": "Context: This morning I opened my Degiro app (European, no RH here) I saw my boring index fund down a quadrillion and got just a bit annoyed. So I said fuck it, browsed to leveraged products -&gt; short -&gt; S&amp;P 500. Until here, everything fine. Then a bunch of stuff came up to the screen, something like \"turbo\", \"limited turbo\", \"best turbo\", with a bunch of obscure letters and numbers, like SP&amp;500 SL 3100 HB 60 FN 3100. I swear to God it's the first time I hear about it and I have no fucking idea of what this turbo is and what these numbers mean, beside that is some kind of spy put option. Perfect, I bought some of it. After a couple of hours I see +5% and I sell. Nice. So I did it again with a bit more cash. I'm currently up 10% in like 3 hours. \n\nQuestion is, provided that I don't want to know what exactly I bought (no spoilers plz), should I hold it over the weekend or take profits?", "created_utc": 1582900739, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/favn1e/holding_puts_over_the_weekend/", "is_self": true}
