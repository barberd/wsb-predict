{"id": "f8kmwc", "title": "WWE Stock Calls (You Will Make Money)", "selftext": "The company was hit with a huge stock reaction to news of fired executives. However it is currently re-correcting itself. First green candlestick over the SMA line. MacD in agreement. RSI trending upward. You've got super showdown this week in Saudi Arabia on 2/27 and of course Wrestlemania the next month. In a market of complete uncertainty this is a stock that I can see easily hit the 60's and 70's over the next month. Just as long as the wrestlers traveling overseas don't come down with Coronavirus. Put in 3/20 or 4/17 calls and you will be handsomely rewarded.", "created_utc": 1582512909, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f8kmwc/wwe_stock_calls_you_will_make_money/", "is_self": true}
