{"id": "g3cb8m", "title": "-87,318.70... robinhood. What just happened?? HELP!", "selftext": "I'll start by saying I am fairly new to investing in options trading. But I did my research before investing and I accepted the risks. But WTF is this... If someone can explain what just happened, I would greatly appreciate it. I am panicking at this point... \n\nHere is my situation. I had 3 spreads that expired today (4/17/20) \n\nMSFT 147/150 call spread (Collateral 300) (I took in 160 credit; I put down 140 dollars) NVDA 212.5/217.5 call spread (Collateral 500) (I took in 258 credit; I put down 242 dollars) BA 100/105 calls (Collateral 500) (I took in 250 credit; I put down 250 dollars)\n\nThey all expired today. I should have just lost my collateral (which is 140+242+250= 632). And I had 2290.65 buying power. Now I am seeing -87,318.70 dollars in my account. \n\nI am possibly guessing this is a mistake since my history say, the orders are pending. But I wanted to get some input. I attached all the pics. If someone can please explain this, that would be great. Thank you.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/w7aY4P6](https://imgur.com/a/w7aY4P6)", "created_utc": 1587163495.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g3cb8m/8731870_robinhood_what_just_happened_help/", "is_self": true}
