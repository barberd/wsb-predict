And if they would, I do not do that thing** - (*Dwight Schrute*) and Also *Every WSB autist before reloading their broker account with funds for the 69th time after making a YOLO brokerino play thinking that they would not do it again.*\n\nI usually post stuff like this when I see retards talking about their plays in the daily threads, plays that no one should be making, **EVER**.\n\nI posted a comment in the daily thread this morning that received little attention, lot of comments suggesting I reduce my adderral/meth/coke intake and a few DMs asking me to convert it to a post. So here we are.\n\n---\n\n**TLDR**; Don't listen to me, I'm an autist who's been trading options for 5 months; Up 177% in March, Down 22% in April - stubbornly bag holding SPY 5/15 220p for a month before finally letting go (*I know*) - currently down 7% All-time. \n\n---\n\nFor what it's worth, I'm under the illusion that I have a few tips to share and hopefully help some people here because I'm fairly certain most of you dipshits are more retarded than me and don't yet realize that you're playing a losing battle. So let's begin.\n\n\n# Basics:\n\n##### 1. Closing Positions (Consistent locked gains >>>> bag holding with hopes of a 10 bagger)\n- Every morning there are a huge number of retards asking `Up Bigly on $TICKER pre-market *rocket emoji* *penis emoji* , should I sell at open or hold?` If you're one of them, I want you to do two things - \n- First, take a look at your All-time performance. For most of you, this should be enough to snap you back to reality and answer the question whether you need to lock these fucking gains for the sake of your portfolio or bag hold in hopes of a 10 bagger with a risk of being wiped out.\n- Second, remind yourself that we are in the middle of a fucking pandemic, with multiple countries possibly heading into recession, and you're trading in this absolute shit show of a market that is waiting for a single bad news to drop dead, and yeah lets not forget about a possible trade war brewing on the side.\n- Personally, I lock in gains when I'm up over 40% on a play, which in this retarded market is not hard to find and look for a re-entry with increased capital.\n- Don't be stubborn like I was and hold bad positions for too long, if you made a 2k investment on a few SPY contracts and it dips beyond 30%, either open a small hedge position or close your positions and take a one day break to reset. 1.4k capital in hand is way better than a full 2k loss.\n- It's your money, you're free to YOLO and diamond hands with dreams of catching a 10 bagger, but for the sake of your peace of mind please don't. I'm fucking sick of looking at all the loss porn from blown up accounts in our subreddit. This is coming from someone who went from +177% to -22% in three weeks. It is absolutely fucking brutal.\n\n##### 2. Gambling YOLO FDs on current market trend (Dumb fucking bulls, this one is for you)\n- I consider buying current market trend FDs (**SPY** had a +2% day and you're buying more calls --> betting in the direction of the current market trend) as a YOLO.\n- Buying more calls is a YOLO because you\u2019re purchasing inflated option contracts with a gamble that it climbs further. So be wary before placing a bet because it can be wiped off very quickly if shit hits the fan.\n- So many people don\u2019t know this but VIX(**VXX/UVXY**) calls are an amazing hedge when you YOLO into SPY calls during rallies like a retard. Surprise intra-day dumps (like the one that happened today and one day past week) will fuck with your peace of mind and force you to panic sell if you don\u2019t have insurance(VIX Calls) - having VIX calls will keep you in the game longer and they\u2019re a fuckton cheaper than SPY contracts.\n- Even worse, if the dump rolls over to the next day and you couldn't close your calls waiting for a EOD pump - your hedge will keep you solvent and might even make bank depending on how it plays out.\n\n\n##### 3. Buying FDs against current market trend (Fellow bear brothers, this one is for you)\n- As opposed to current market trend FDs, options that reverse the current market trend should never be a YOLO. You should be fucking building a position slowly that is resilient to small market movements (Newbies, this means that if the current market trend is uppies - you should be buying shorts **at least** 2 weeks or a month out so that you don't get cucked by Greeks if the rally continues for a few days).\n- Let\u2019s say SPY has been rallying for days in a row and weekly SPY puts have become dirt cheap. I know a lot of you autists will fucking YOLO into weekly puts and then bitch about how the market is fucking retarded when the rally continues and your puts end up toast.\n- It\u2019s fair to be agitated but it\u2019s better to be smart and build a monthly put position slowly averaging in depending on how the market is behaving.\n- You can be even smarter and get a few slightly OTM weekly calls (weekly calls that are +5/7$ above current stock price are dirt fucking cheap for SPY) to hedge against the loss that your PUT position will be bleeding in the long run if the rally continues and give you a decent chance to exit with a minimal loss if you feel the play is no longer aimed at a feasible strike price and allow you to roll-over to a better strike price.\n\n##### 4. Maintaining your sanity (saved the best one for last)\n- I was**(??)** a very emotional trader, the rush when you're trading naked Tesla FDs and making tendies is beyond fucking amazing. But I realized I'm becoming fucking desensitized to profits. When I went up from 150% to 177% just rinse repeating buying SPY puts I barely felt anything (market was in super fucking easy mode in March). My friends went fucking crazy and were really happy for me but I wasn't feeling anything inside, like yeah, whatever.\n- As I dropped down to -22%, I realized both profits and losses can make you desensitized. There were times where I would be thinking about the market all day, watching futures all night like a fucking degenerate and barely sleep 4hours a day except for weekends.\n- If there is one piece of advice that I really wish for you autistic fucks to pick up from this post is this: **LEARN TO FUCKING ENJOY THE GAINS YOU MAKE BEFORE YOU FUCKING YOLO IT BACK INTO THE MARKET YOU GREEDY FUCKING BASTARDS.** \ufeff \ufeff \n\n- I was up 8K during yesterdays rally. After closing my calls yesterday, for the first time, I transferred some money back in to my bank account (*holy fucking shit, can you imagine that this move also exists?*) and it felt sooooooo fucking good. Never thought of doing this when I was up bigly in March.\n\n- Also purchased a bunch of stuff that I've been wanting to buy for a long time but kept delaying because it didn't make sense to buy expensive materialistic goods during a pandemic but my brain is **OK** with me gambling on expensive option contracts? Fucking unreal.\n\n- I'm not saying buying material possessions are a gateway to happiness but I know all you dopamine whores are exactly like me. You fucks would think twice or thrice before buying a new hoodie/sneakers/expensive earphones or whatever shit you're into but will willingly fucking YOLO your gains into a new play in a heartbeat like true autists, before doing something that you enjoy with that money and end up losing it all. It's beyond fucking crazy.\n\n- **WHAT'S THE FUCKING POINT OF ALL THESE GAINS IF YOUV'E BECOME SO FUCKING INSENSITIVE AND OBSESSED WITH THE MARKET THAT YOU DON'T EVENT BOTHER ENJOYING YOUR LIFE? (SORRY LADS, SMOKING WEED AND DAY DRINKING DON'T COUNT)**\n\n---\n\n- In closing, I want to remind you guys that there is no point in being hard on yourself when you're making bad plays and getting too cocky when you're making tendies. Try to learn from bad plays, read about different options strategies, relax and fucking enjoy the tendies once in a while, that's what makes us human after-all.\n\n- Tyler Durden said it best:\n> **Man, I see in WSB the autistic and gayest men who've ever lived. I see all this potential, and I see it squandered. God damn it, an entire generation buying YOLO FDs, bag holding dumb plays without locking profits \u2013 retards with -99% portfolios. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need. We're the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our great war is a spiritual war. Our great depression is our lives. We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars, but we won't. We're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very pissed off.**\n\n--- \n\nAlright folks, sensei out. Good luck to everyone, lets get them tendies without losing ourselves in the process.\n\n---\n\nIf this post doesn't get removed, mods can I get a flair replacement?
