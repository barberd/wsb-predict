Digital advertising at Dow Jones rose 25% year over year despite the challenges we faced with ad sales later in March. This is in strikingly marked contrast to the performance of the New York Times, where digital ad revenue actually declined 8%. I should repeat those figures for the purpose of clarity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFeel like this could be a good one. Ppl need news, and WSJ is one of the GOATS. NY Post is fantastic clickbait shit. And with the biggest retail investment volume since ever, things like marketwatch and Dow Jones should bring in $$$ as well.
