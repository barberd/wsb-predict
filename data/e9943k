On RH I still see that with 21 analyst ratings it\u2019s still a 90% buy. It did drop a whopping 7% today though. I set a market sell to 30$ from my investment at $32 to minimize losses as I am all in on this bihh. Watchu guys think? Balls deep still or pull out and do the spit take (spit on they back to pretend like you came) then dip tf out to Wendy\u2019s?", "created_utc": 1576081004, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e9943k/pton_gets_5_price_target_from_asshoe/", "is_self": true}
