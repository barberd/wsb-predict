This rule applies to general aviation and commercial aviation. It\u2019s called ADS-B, and it really is going to make flying far safer. Now, being someone in the industry, I can tell you lots of companies and regular people are rushing to be compliant to remain airworthy for the 2020 deadline. Garmin is the largest manufacturer of ADS-B compliant transponders so it might be worth it to look at that stock. I don\u2019t know how to do stocks but this is big boi moves in a market I know well.
