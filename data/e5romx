{"id": "e5romx", "title": "A wallstreetbets SCP. SCP 42069", "selftext": "Item #: SCP 42069\n\nObject class: Keter\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n\nSCP 42069 is to be hooked up to and placed inside a Tesla Cyber truck. This truck is to be placed inside a climate controlled environment with temps no lower than [redacted] and an area no larger than 100 square feet. \n\nEvery Monday at 0900 eastern time SCP 42069 is to be shown the tweets from the previous president Donald Trump. These tweets must mention the trade war between the year 2018 and 2021. \n\nEvery Friday night at 1400 eastern time SCP is to be shown a photo of CNBC smokeshow Morgan Brennan. This photo will calm SCP 42069 and SCP 42069-2 instances. \n\nUnder no circumstances will the words bullish, ITM, or long aapl ever be muttered near SCP 42069. This will cause the premature summoning and awakening of SCP 42069-2. \n\nIf this occurs a metal ball bearing will be thrown at the driver window. This will put SCP into a deep \u201csleep\u201d where no activity will be seen for the next four weeks. \n\nItem description:\n\nSCP 42069 is a semi-self aware Bloomberg terminal. This particular SCP was discovered on the trading floor of the NYSE during the flash crash of 2018. It is believed to be responsible for this due to an infinite leverage glitch. How it managed to do this is still being researched, but it is believed someone installed Robinhood into this terminal. \n\nEvery morning at 0930 eastern time SCP 42069 will analyze the tweets shown to it and begin saying things like \u201cbear gang rise up\u201d, or \u201crecession incoming\u201d depending on the tweet. If the tweets are positive then it will say things like \u201cstonks only go up.\u201d\n\nEvery Wednesday around 0925 SCP 42069-2will manifest in the passenger seat. SCP 42069-2 is a male Neanderthal with what appears to be an android cellphone. This leads us to believe that SCP 42069-2 was a lower class male in his previous life.\n\nHe appears to be recording himself prior to the market open. Upon closer observation the cell phone is displaying AAPL puts with a position size of 50k, and puts 40% OTM. The app starts off green and then turns red shortly after 0930. Not a single noise comes from SCP 42069-2 except for what sounds like \u201cGUH\u201d which is uttered around 40 seconds after it manifests. \n\n\n\n\n//The End \n\nSent from an iPhone", "created_utc": 1575423724, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e5romx/a_wallstreetbets_scp_scp_42069/", "is_self": true}
