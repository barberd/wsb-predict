{"id": "fw3izn", "title": "Stocks only go one direction", "selftext": "The long term trend of the stock market is likely going to be sharply up, given that the government is controlling the market, the virus numbers are continuing to slow, and the current trend in the market.\n\nBig government is controlling the market, which is seen the Fed\u2019s utilization of its various tools. For example, JPow has unlocked unlimited QE, giving the banks all the liquidity that they need throughout this crisis. There will be no instances of banks running out of money in this crisis, which means no run on the banks. This means the banks have almost no risk and will have government backed loans added to their balance sheets. This is all augmented by the stimulus checks that will be hitting the average American\u2019s bank account in a couple weeks, compliments of big government.\n\nAll of this would be futile, except that the big picture is starting to look up. Worldwide new Covid-19 cases are down as of yesterday, from 80 to 70k. In addition, the global number of deaths has also dropped from 6k to <5k. This dataset has led to headlines coming out of Norway that the government has everything under control. Georgia has taken the symbolic step of opening up its beaches, Washington State has sent 400 ventilators back to the government, and NYC has reported a 50% reduction in hospitalizations. Furthermore, UPenn has just announced a third vaccine that is about to enter Phase 1 clinical trials. With these reports circulating the globe, as well as oil prospects looking up, there is no longer evidence that the virus will cause a longer term impact on the stock market. It may take a while for main street to catch up, but the long term picture is increasingly optimistic.\n\nAll of the above has made a powerful impact on the market\u2019s current trend. On SPY, the MA (10 close 2) is now looking up in the daily and hourly views. The RSI has risen to 56, and still has plenty of room to grow. The price action has held strong at 250, with a powerful push up to nearly 263 at the time of this writing. While previous action does not dictate future moves, there is a mountain of evidence demanding review that says these moves are the natural consequence of both natural and government-driven events. This all points to an upward action, which may see a complete recovery as early as late April.\n\nIt is difficult to draw any conclusions with a beast as unpredictable as the stock market, but it is clear that government manipulation of both the markets and the reported virus numbers have created a trend in the market that is likely to move numbers into an upswing. While these numbers may not reflect reality, it may also be time to accept that stocks go whichever direction the government wants them to go.\n\nSPY 5/1 330c", "created_utc": 1586195948.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fw3izn/stocks_only_go_one_direction/", "is_self": true}
