{"id": "h9ox7j", "title": "NAHB Housing Index Released Tomorrow - $ITB", "selftext": "TL;DR at the top because who reads:\n\n* ITB 6/19 44.5C - highly unusual options activity,  $415k bullish bet was placed here when there was no OI\n* LEN 6/19 65 C - ER is tomorrow, so this isn't really a play but a key position to ITB see below\n\nTomorrow the NAHB Index is  released at 10 AM. NAHB is essentially just the housing index and indicates the health  of the housing market. It took a major crash  back  in  Feb-April but  made a huge  bounce back in May. The report is announced monthly.  [https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/nahb-housing-market-index-218](https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/nahb-housing-market-index-218)\n\nThe expected forecast of the index is 45. I believe it will be greater than that up  to 47+,  if it hits 50 then we're going to the moon.  50 is an indicator that means the housing market is doing well (who knows if that's true, it doesn't matter b/c the market means nothing)\n\nThe last release in May was above the guidance and it broke out the morning after of 7-8%:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fah2kbtq15551.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=3df956dc0bac3c216467d608f7c4b2d336c81203\n\nWhy this play will print:\n\n* Home sales have yet to decline. If you read the news on housing, house prices have not dropped and more people are still in the market even after the virus. I know friends that just went into Escrow in California.\n* Construction and home building related businesses remained essential throughout the shutdown.\n* LEN is one of the biggest holdings in the ITB ETF - accounting for 14% of the ETF. If LEN also breaks out the earnings, then you  could expect ITB to have a huge break out. LEN is announcing ER at 11 AM.\n* EDIT: LEN released earnings, conf call is tomorrow at 11 AM: [https://investors.lennar.com/press-releases/2020/06-15-2020-213531886](https://investors.lennar.com/press-releases/2020/06-15-2020-213531886)\n   * EPS beat but slight revenue miss, average earnings. Thesis still stands in NAHB\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bk9x6v3025551.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5176312c3b6f69f21e58ae0de6412c671034790", "created_utc": 1592255218.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h9ox7j/nahb_housing_index_released_tomorrow_itb/", "is_self": true}
