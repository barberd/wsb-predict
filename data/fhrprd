Everybody is forgetting about the most important thing here, which is buying the fucking dip. There's never been so many chances before! \n\nEveryone always says, if only I'd bought into *meme* when it dipped... well now everything is dipping! You can buy a dip tomorrow, and maybe another dip the Monday after that! If you miss one dip, just buy the next one when it dips further.\n\n I'd make sure you spread out your dip buying experience though, so you can buy as many dips as possible for as long as possible. Never really understood what step 2 was supposed to be after buying dips, but apparently its a fun thing to do, and I'm pretty sure profit comes into play somewhere.\n\nTLDR; July 17 $1000 TSLA calls", "created_utc": 1584063194.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhrprd/theres_never_been_so_many_chances_to_btfd/", "is_self": true}
