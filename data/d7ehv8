Their new aero upgrade put em on pole on the most down force heavy circuit on the calendar, a race they were not expected to qualify well in. \n\nLong story short, ferrari is back after a shit start to the F1 season, must be due to AMD.\n\nBuy calls\n\nBuy extra calls if Ferrari wins tomorrow\n\nBuy extra extra calls if Ferrari 1-2 tomorrow.", "created_utc": 1569091777, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d7ehv8/amd_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
