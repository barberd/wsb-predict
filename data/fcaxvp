{"id": "fcaxvp", "title": "BTFD - are you?", "selftext": "Is it just me, or hard not to be bullish right now? In my view equities have erroneously priced in potential coronavirus economic impacts. Global markets have fallen in record (literally) fashion on vague information and fear-mongering unscrupulous headlines to say the least, with many unimpacted stocks falling much harder than directly impacted stocks which implies a significant element of panic and irrationality. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSure, China\u2019s PMIs declined to unprecedented levels even compared to the GFC. However, China will inject liquidity easing and policy rate cuts this month to mitigate the economic impact from the Coronavirus - Q2/Q3 will be relentless stimulus season with global balance sheet expansion and rate cuts. The RBA is likely to cut 50bp tomorrow. US treasuries are pricing a 50bp cut for March 17/18th. RBNZ priced to cut 25bp in March, BOJ governor Kuroda pledged to keep high liquidity conditions and BOJ just bought 105bil yen of Japanese ETFs, &amp; BOE says it will \u201ctake all needed steps to protect stability\u201d...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen markets get sold on the unknown, rather than the known, I see that as an auspicious buy opportunity for a long-term hold. Maybe investors were looking for a reason to take profit after a monster Q4 earnings season, and I don\u2019t dispute the negative impacts from supply chains disruptions and stocks should minorly correct accordingly, but indices dropping -13% in a week is insane. Stock prices reflect the next 80+ quarters of earnings, not merely limited to a lacklustre quarter ahead \u2014still, US 10 and 30 years at all-time low yields, 1.077% and 1.646%. The Fed has been transparent they want to boost inflation, and with treasuries real returns capped under 1% and heading towards negative in real terms, holding treasuries is only a defensive/preservation strategy nowadays and investors need growth. When coronavirus inevitably blows over, the world will be left with plenty of monetary and fiscal stimulus, low-interest rates near if not at 0% pa in real terms and equity valuations reflecting that. I can\u2019t see that dynamic changing long term.", "created_utc": 1583149892, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fcaxvp/btfd_are_you/", "is_self": true}
