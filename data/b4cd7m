{"id": "b4cd7m", "title": "My stock list and analysis", "selftext": "1. AMZN (Amazon) = SELL. Jeff Bezos is tone deaf to the political realities facing him. He embroils himself in controversies and doesn\u2019t get it because they\u2019re intangible and don\u2019t fit in the data. He sees Amazon as the #1 strongest brand most emulated, and then he wonders why the Fire Phone failed and why Amazon\u2019s own brands won\u2019t take off. It\u2019s because people like Amazon for their execution of convenience, but do not associate Amazon with quality or tech innovation. Amazon is a total SELL, at a certain point people aren\u2019t going to pay for Prime regardless of how much it offers if they feel they are selling out to some evil corporation.\n\n2. AAPL (Apple) = BUY. Apple focuses on the brand, and their new push toward associating their brand with privacy is only going to allow them to charge more of a premium for their products. Tim Cook is a solid CEO on the supply chain side of things, and Apple has a good tone where they don\u2019t buy overpriced companies but rather small startups and then immerse them into their plans for the next big thing. Apple is not going anywhere, and their ability to attract top talent, respect, and admiration means that Apple will continue to be a dominant player in at least the next decade.\n\n3. GOOGL (Google) = BUY. Google has figured out the key to a successful Internet app: tech talent + funding. So I like Google\u2019s model of making billions off search advertising, and then using it to fund all these different app ideas and initiatives. I think they\u2019re doing it smartly, and so many incredible things Google has brought forth have been only invaluable in making people naturally gravitate toward continue use of Google search. Especially their maps app, people take for granted how that revolutionized gps and Google gives it out, without charging a subscription like any other company would have to if it weren\u2019t being subsidized by another division like Google\u2019s advertising biz.\n\n4. WMT (Walmart) = BUY. Walmart is dominating online grocery, retail, and has a competitive wage starting at $11/hr. I\u2019ll be honest, I don\u2019t see the market appreciating how well positioned Walmart is within tech, retail, and international markets, but I do believe that in time if Walmart continues to play to their strengths of using their physical stores to allow for people to shop online then pickup without having to go inside, Walmart will continue to be the most relevant player in retail. Not only that, but Amazon is priced like a tech stock not a retail stock while Walmart is priced like a retail stock not a tech stock, which in my opinion means Amazon has nowhere to go but down and Walmart has nowhere to go but up as its value is realized.\n\n5. BRK.A (Berkshire) = SELL. Buffett outlived the age of value investing, dude can\u2019t just sit out tech stocks for so long and think he could still beat the market. I mean, I have huge respect for Buffett, Buffett\u2019s brilliance, and Buffett\u2019s philanthropy, I just see someone who does stuff like buy Oracle for one quarter and then sell because he says he doesn\u2019t want to get burned like he did with IBM, and I see someone who has outlived the era of value investing where you can\u2019t just price based on assets in a world where it is impossible to value the assets of tech.\n\n6. NFLX (Netflix) = SELL. Netflix really needs to buy a studio or two, their storytelling abilities suck, and it\u2019s a shame because they definitely have the technology and user base. And I don\u2019t think Netflix can just rely on people pitching their scripts to Netflix first, they really should have an in house team like a Pixar or something.\n\n7. TSLA (Tesla) = BUY. Elon Musk is autist extraordinaire, and it doesn\u2019t matter if he has a hissyfit with the SEC, everyone is rooting for Tesla to win, and a lot of people are putting their money where their mouths are. People have been begging for electric cars for decades, and with Silicon Valley funding it is 100% possible for a car company to come out of there, especially with a PayPal Mafia member running the show.\n\n8. MSFT (Microsoft) = BUY. Microsoft has been in the top 10 most valuable companies for the past 3 decades, and I love Satya Nadella. Microsoft continues to innovate, grow, and create a strong and solid brand people like and respect. Microsoft is a total BUY without a doubt.\n\n9. DIS (Disney) = SELL. Disney is about to get their ass handed to them in streaming, it\u2019s not as easy as buying a domain and server. They don\u2019t have the coders, they don\u2019t have the tech, and they do not have anything that will make this compete with a Netflix, except for all the brands and franchises they own. I mean, look at Hulu, that app is garbage, and if Disney couldn\u2019t get their act together on that app which they now own 60% of, what\u2019s to say they\u2019ll be able to do any better with an over the top streaming service they\u2019re creating from scratch. Bob Iger is a solid CEO who has done well by Disney, but Disney\u2019s strong suit is telling stories, not serving them, and Disney would\u2019ve made more money keep licensing their content out, including to Netflix, instead of trying to compete headon. At least that\u2019s my opinion. Also, Lucasfilm was a total write off as there clearly is nowhere to go after the original trilogy, and people are starting to get tired of safe bets like remakes and sequels, of which Disney won\u2019t stop churning out until it stops making money.\n\n10. FB (Facebook) = SELL. I totally forgot about this company until someone posted something about it today. Does anyone still use Facebook? Like regardless of the creep ceo, the invasion of privacy, and the controversies, what use does a website created for the needs of 2004 serve today. Twitter will continue to stay relevant as a replacement for establishment media and also a way for establishment media to make their own stories by analyzing tweets, Snapchat will probably stay relevant as the anti facebook with teens, and group messaging apps will be the new form of social network as people become aware of the dangers of a lack of privacy. WhatsApp and Instagram will do okay until Zuckerberg destroys them by combining them with Facebook, and all of a sudden old people and bots will mess up those two cool spaces, and by then Zuckerberg won\u2019t be able to simply buy the next big thing.\n\n", "created_utc": 1553298970, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b4cd7m/my_stock_list_and_analysis/", "is_self": true}
