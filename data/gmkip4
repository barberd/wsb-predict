{"id": "gmkip4", "title": "Hello fresh again", "selftext": "Hello fresh is a German company that sells food kits so you can cook something at home. That of cause took off when Corona hit. They gained 317% over the last year and reached an all time high of 42\u20ac a week ago. That's when long term investors took their gains which lead to the stock being worth 36.50\u20ac today. I think it's time to double down. JPMorgan estimates the value at 45-50\u20ac and Morgan Stanley recently set it from overweight to equal weight with an estimate of 42\u20ac. They report earnings on August 11th. So even if it's overvalued there's enough time to sell the profits. Literally can't go tits up.\nEdit: removed personal problems", "created_utc": 1589876395.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gmkip4/hello_fresh_again/", "is_self": true}
