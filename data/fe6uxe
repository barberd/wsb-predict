{"id": "fe6uxe", "title": "Profiting off the market in uncertain times", "selftext": "Alright, listen up you bunch of reee's. I just got banned from r/investing for trying to help these poor saps who come on there and say things like \"the market looks low and I have 50k what should I invest in\".\n\nMy suggestions were simple and reasonable for the investing sub - cash, prime money markets or bonds. What do I get? A bunch of fucks in denial about the state of affairs in the country who live in a bubble and couldn't drink water if you led them to it. Then, I get insulted and called a fear monger when I didn't even say anything else literally except the 3 suggestions for their money.\n\nWith that being said, though I'm not a MOD because I'm not gay it's time for a wise talk. Under no circumstances should anyone here be cheering the economy takes a shit or glorifying the situation. The reality is that people are getting sick, people are dying and people are scared. If you root for destruction to support your tendie gains that is fine, but do it in private because that shit is not classy and tasteless. I'm hedged, but I don't wish bad things on anyone.\n\nIf I see it, I'm calling you out for the piece of shit you are and flagging your posts. All things being equal, I hope your trades work out and you make a lot of money. Maybe you can put some of that to good use and help the people dealing with this crisis.\n\nEdit: I should have clarified. What I meant to say is if you root for death, not \"cheering the economy takes a shit\". I want your puts to print, just don't cheer death.", "created_utc": 1583462600.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fe6uxe/profiting_off_the_market_in_uncertain_times/", "is_self": true}
