The Price Is Too Damn High.\n\n1. 737-Max still not flying don\u2019t know when it will be up in the air.\n2. Airtravel is going down due to Beer Virus and it will only get worse. \n3. ME3 will start cutting traffic to Middle East due to minimize virus spread. They are big buyers of Boeing\u2019s.\n4. Airlines will start cutting options since the demand will be going down for a few quarters.\n5. Churn in management and Board of Directors.\n\nSo with that said Boeing is ripe for a major correction. In 2000, and 2008 BA corrected by more than 50%. After the correction pile in the money for the bulls. \n\nPuts on BA short and long. The options are still quite lucrative right now. Given the high stock price lot of upside if BA starts correction in earnest.", "created_utc": 1582801461, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/faahah/ba_boeing_not_crashing_yet/", "is_self": true}
