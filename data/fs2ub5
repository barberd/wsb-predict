AMA.", "selftext": "My fellow Aumericans \u2013 \n\nIt is with sorrow that I announce that today was my breaking point. The day I realized that we cannot expect to see market norms based on news in these modern times of unlimited QE and brrrs. We can't. And I won't. \n\nToday I officially paper handed my puts and rolled over into calls and common stock. Like a bitch. And I made money doing it. So fuck you. \n\nAnd here's the deal. You can do it too. You really can. Futures are up again (although the markets seem to not give a shit about futures nowadays.) \n\nI'll probably wait until this thing hits 270-275 or so and then take my tendies to cash land and wait this thing out hoping we start trending toward a retest. Until then...fuck puts. These things paid back when volatility was at an all-time high and the market was hitting CBs daily. Now we can't even catch a -4% swing to save our lives. \n\nI'll take my melt up money for now. \n\n$SPY 4/20(!) 280c / $SPY 5/1 275c", "created_utc": 1585614777.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fs2ub5/i_sold_all_my_puts_and_loaded_up_on_calls_common/", "is_self": true}
