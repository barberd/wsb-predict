{"id": "g7b9z4", "title": "BYND, TSLA and SBUX discussion", "selftext": "So I bought puts on UAL and DAL and the puts have done quite well, I'm cashing out of them for now.  \n\nI'm thinking now of getting puts on BYND, TSLA, and SBUX.  Thoughts on any of these three?\n\nBYND I believe has surged over-optimistically on the hope that it will pop in China due to being sold in SBUX there, I strongly suspect BYND will not penetrate much if the Chinese market.  \n\nTSLA because I'm frankly surprised that it hasn't seen a more significant drop considering that it sells electric cars during a time of historic lows for oil prices. \n\nSBUX because they have popped due to optimism in regards to their strategy of still serving clients despite the Coronavirus.  In addition to my uncertainty to their strategy, I struggle to believe that people will be more interested in buying fancy and expensive coffee when they have spent the last months locked indoors and possibly realizing that they can homebrew for much quicker, better quality, and cheaper coffee.", "created_utc": 1587745115.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7b9z4/bynd_tsla_and_sbux_discussion/", "is_self": true}
