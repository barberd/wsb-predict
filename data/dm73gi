Thinking of trying to recapture my losses ($36k) by rolling my 185s into 190s. 200 by 12/20 could have me at 100k off a $5k investment. 17% jump from right now but only a 7% jump from the previous all time high.\n\nAm I autistic? Good earnings could raise it 5-10% and some analyst upgrades and sector rotation back into payment growth stocks could get me there right?\n\nTell me what I\u2019m missing with Visa. Most analysts already have a price target of 200 on it and I read a DCF analysis (haven\u2019t recreated it) with Visa\u2019s growth numbers that has them valued at $189 a share. With the massive opportunity in B2B payments I could see them raising guidance if they\u2019re growing quicker than expected there (very possible).\n\nSomeone tell me what the fuck I\u2019m missing with Visa because I\u2019m down almost 90% and wondering why.", "created_utc": 1571870280, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dm73gi/visa_200_by_december/", "is_self": true}
