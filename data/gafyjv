{"id": "gafyjv", "title": "[DD] APRN (Blue Apron) down over 20% on the day, still a LONG WAY down to go.", "selftext": "Before the pandemic, Blue Apron was trading at an appropriate share price of around $2.50. After Covid-19, it became something of a meme \"OMG everyone is going to be ordering food while they are at home! Blue Apron is cheap compared to other meal delivery stocks! BUY BUY BUY!!!\"\n\nThe stock quickly went up to a mind boggling $27 per share before trading was halted, and settled somewhere between $11-$12 after it resumed in the following weeks (still way too high for this trash company).\n\nWhat all of these new buyers did not know about Blue Apron, is there is a reason the stock was so cheap compared to it's competitors. It's a very poorly run company. APRN is unable to hold on to new customers despite spending insane amounts on marketing to acquire them:\n\n**Customer count Q4 2018:** 557,000\n\n**Customer count Q1 2019:** 550,000\n\n**Customer Count Q2 2019:** 449,000\n\n**Customer Count Q3 2019:** 386,000\n\n**Customer Count Q4 2019:** 351,000\n\n**Customer Count Q1 2020:** 376,000\n\nWhile they are spending money to acquire customers, customers are leaving in droves. They tried to switch focus to just keeping their \"loyal\" customers and reduce marketing spend, but to no avail. The good news was that they were finally acquiring new customers due to the pandemic without having to spend a lot of $ to acquire them. Or so everyone thought...\n\nFast forward to the earnings call today which was a complete cluster fuck. The CEO announced that they saw a 29% uptick of demand for meal kits - awesome right? Well they were only able to fill 22% of those orders.\n\nYes that's right, when Blue Apron was given a golden opportunity to save their failing business they weren't even in a position to fill all of the orders they received. During the Q&A section of today's earning call one investor asked how much revenue was lost due to their inability to meet demand...they wouldn't give us the numbers (guess it was that bad).\n\nThere was also a funny moment on the call this morning when an investor asked how they planned to keep the current increased demand due to covid-19 going when this all dies down, especially now that most places in America outside of a few hotspots have more than peaked for new cases...the reply was a laughable explanation of how they think \"this is the new normal, and the demand will not go away\" or some bullshit like that. Their business plan amounts to hoping that the pandemic never goes away? O.k...\n\nSo what did all of this boil down to? Within the first minutes of the market opening, shares were down well over 30% with APRN being subject to a circuit breaker. The stock settled around a 24% loss for the day. I was watching the charts very closely all morning.\n\n24% plummet in a single day. \n\nSo did you miss the boat? I don't think so. This stock was trading under $3 before the coronavirus hype, and shot up only because of the pandemic. Most businesses are dealing with loss of business due to the pandemic, and this is one of the few companies that actually saw an increase in demand due to it. In a favorable environment, APRN failed spectacularly.\n\nI wouldn't buy puts as far down as $3 (even though I think it will go even below that eventually) due to the time sensitive nature of options but I think there is still more money to be made here. Morgan Stanley's price target on the stock is $6 and it's still trading well above that. \n\nLinks for research (this post is basically info from these articles mixed in with my commentary of this mornings earnings call that I listened in on):\n\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/blue-apron-shares-slide-9-premarket-after-earnings-miss-but-sees-strong-demand-for-q2-2020-04-29\n\nhttps://news.alphastreet.com/a-visual-dashboard-of-blue-aprons-aprn-q1-2020-earnings-results/\n\nhttps://www.streetinsider.com/Earnings/Blue+Apron+%28APRN%29+Misses+Q1+EPS+by+1c%2C+Sees+Q2+Revenue+Growth/16801076.html\n\nhttps://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/blue-apron-stock-price-reaction-morgan-stanley-price-target-cut-2019-6-1028307153", "created_utc": 1588188815.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gafyjv/dd_aprn_blue_apron_down_over_20_on_the_day_still/", "is_self": true}
