I saw so many comments stating \u201ccan\u2019t get worse than this\u201d\n\nIt can and it will. LYV went below 5 dollars in 09 when it had over $20 value the year before. Think it can\u2019t do it now? Lol\n\nAlso one thing I\u2019m learning about, be bold you autists. Balls deep produces more tendies. \n\nTl;dr puts LYV April or may under 35. I think shit spikes tomorrow so make a bet. \n\nAlso if GoPro goes below 2.50 try to get options at 2.50/3$ strike price for a few months out, quick flips can be made", "created_utc": 1584051962.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhoxeu/pay_attention_to_2008_stop_saying_this_cant_get/", "is_self": true}
