I barely know what i am talking about and i have posted absolutely no reference material but this is what i think is going on.** \n\nThe people who dont read into the epidemiology of Covid-19 are the real butt heads. \n\nComparing the flu to it is like comparing a pinto to a ferrari.\n\nMy heart goes out to china, they are getting effed by their government, its gut wrenching. cant even watch the leaked footage. Like the impotent pence, all i can do is pray for them. Also notice how the US isntt really reporting the effed up shit thats happening out there? Remember the NBA? Maybe China has us by the balls because they make our anti-biotics? I imagine it would take at least a year to bootstrap our own production. \n\nThe united states was greedy enough and dumb enough to give production of goods to an authoritarian government, hence they have quite a bit of leverage over us during dire times like this. as was seen when they silenced our most vocal social justice celebrities.\n\nIve asked everyone i know what they think about the virus and pretty much everybody is ignorant. They dont know how fast covid-19 spreads and how its mortality rate spreads out based on age. Some believe its just another thing that will go away like all the other ones. \n\n**Virus Spread Rate:**\n\nIn south Korea cases are doubling every 2.4 days. Pretty sure the CDC or WHO or whoever is trying to get people to not panic includes chinas bull shit numbers in their analysis. No further research was done into this, i have a full time job (probably not for long) and with that its hard to dig into everything. I rely heavily on small podcast that prove themselves to be rational, logical, and experts in their field, eye witnesses to both the market front and the virus front.  Podcasts are in link below. \n\n**Links:**\n\n*Macro Voices* \\- [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCICRehoZjq3ZtAWgRJX118A/videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCICRehoZjq3ZtAWgRJX118A/videos)\n\n*Peak Prosperity* \\- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVQC1hAYZBs&amp;t=950s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVQC1hAYZBs&amp;t=950s)\n\n**Mortality Rate:**\n\nYouth - low numbers (look it up)\n\nBoomers - 5-14% mortality rate depending on age (look it up)\n\n**Complications Percentage (Requires Hospital):**\n\n20%\n\n**My Shitty understanding of how fast the virus can spread - doubling every 2.4 days.** \n\nIf government does absolutely nothing or our behavior does not change we will have 3 million confirmed cases within 3 months. At 3 million cases we would need 600k hospital beds. US has 100,000 hospital beds total. Think 1929 run on the bank but run on the hospital that spurs pur mania. Again thats if the government does nothing and quarantines and tests are not started immediately. The US not testing people is making us more and more susceptible to a giant shit storm. \n\n**Again i can easily be wrong, im not a dr. or a specialist in anything in any way, just saying what i think and what i have heard.**", "created_utc": 1583062395, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fbsv3o/covid19_shit_storm/", "is_self": true}
