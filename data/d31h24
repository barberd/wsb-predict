Over the past 40 years, it has traded from +20%, to down -50%. \n\nAltria is currently at about -45%, making it almost the biggest discount it has traded at to Staples.\n\nThe rate at which Altria\u2019s stock has declined relative to the decline in cigarette volumes is the most outsized it has ever been on a P/E basis.\n\nAnd the dividend is 7.5%. Big ol juice and I know you fucks don\u2019t do anything but options (me included) it\u2019s a great hedge to inflation and diversifies my all SQ call portfolio.\n\nSo now Juul. The $60 billion elephant in the room. For almost 3 years straight there have been countless people and countless news articles demonizing Juul. Juul seemed like it was on the brink of extinction. The reality Juul has never been anything but a fucking moonshot. 600% to 195% sales growth at a $3.4 billion run rate.\n\nCronos has a long runway, the Juul investment was 10X the size (Juul is 15X the size in terms of market cap) and a much more present catalyst.", "created_utc": 1568255988, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d31h24/altria_trades_at_a_nearly_50_discount_to_staples/", "is_self": true}
