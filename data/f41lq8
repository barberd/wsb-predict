WAIT!?  \n\nSeriously... who comes up with these rules... they need to have some humanity.  \n\nI mean.... is Tuesday going to make me $100,000 or lose me $500?!  \n\nHow do we cope?  HELP!! Can we setup a WSB After Hours Hotline to help us in these moments of despair?", "created_utc": 1581726612, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f41lq8/what_is_the_number_to_the_wsb_after_hours_hotline/", "is_self": true}
