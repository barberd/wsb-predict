After not taking 250% gains yesterday on $RESI with the DD of insider buying on Friday, Amherst owing tons of money, and Amherst having to buy like 5m shares @ $12.50 by EOD today (which may have been small buys over the past few trading days who knows); I'm wondering is there going to be some sort of IV crush? Anyone else concerned or are we to hold these $10c 6/19 for 30 more days? Should have taken the 250% gains now wanna jump off my February 20, 2020 stock chart.", "created_utc": 1589893466.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gmo5yw/safe_get_out_plans_for_resi/", "is_self": true}
