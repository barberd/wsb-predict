This is a long post so for those of you who actually want to understand why you're taking a position and learn about a commodity, read on; for those of you who don't, fuck off.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# OVERALL TL;DR\n\nTankers will have their best earnings call in at least 5 years, if not the last decade, due to all-time-high tanker rates that began spiking towards mid-March. Rates are so high that, say, companies with clean LR2 tankers currently run a spot price of 8x the 5 year historical average and 1 single 2 month voyage is enough to be profitable on the entire year. You're looking to make bets on tanker companies that are trading below their NAV, will post strong FCF, were well positioned for the spike in prices, have large fleets, and have the right types of ships. $NAT is literally the meme-iest stock because it's actually the worst across every single one of these dimensions of any tanker company.\n\n**WHY NAT IS A MEME:**\n\nLet me draw you an analogy:\n\nWSB is a class in school, and you've all decided not to be homosexual for a day. NAT is a girl in the class.  Now that you're not homos, you all start sending NAT dick pics and showering her with attention, assuming that she is extremely high value. However, in your autistic haste, you all forgot to look around and realize that actually, there are 15 other girls in the classroom; moreover, they are all way hotter than NAT.  NAT is now overvalued and many of you are too attached to admit you had no idea what the fuck you were doing and are bagholding now.\n\n**POSITIONS:**\n\nI like EURN and STNG, but there are 10 other options you could look at.  TNK. DSSI, DHT, FRO etc; figure it out.\n\n**Lowest Risk Position Examples**\n\n* EuroNav ($EURN) $12.50C 6/15\n* Scorpio Tankers ($STNG) $23C 6/15\n\n**Moderate Risk Positions**\n\n* $EURN $12.50C 5/15\n* $STNG $25C 5/15\n\n**Higher Risk Positions**\n\n* $EURN $15C 5/15\n* $STNG $30C 5/15\n\n**Legendary Autistic Risk Positions**\n\n* $EURN $17.50C 5/15\n* $STNG $35C 5/15\n* $NAT, any calls\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# SECTION 1: Overview on Oil Demand Crisis\n\nIf you understand oil demand destruction and contango, skip ahead. However, based on the fact that people continue to pile in on USO and UCO calls and leaps under the justification of \"hurr durr oil must go up, right, so cheap\", and half of you are bagholding $NAT still, I assume 75%+ of you are retarded.\n\nMany of you still probably have no idea what's happening with oil and why it's fucked long-term. The tl;dr here is that even with OPEC+'s historical cuts, we're still drastically oversupplied. The problem with oil is it's not your meme SPY calls that are in the cloud; oil is a physical product and when you trade USO, you're trading (theoretically) on receiving delivery of oil. We are almost completely out of oil storage already.\n\nYou may ask, well [u/safuros](https://www.reddit.com/u/safuros/), if that's true, why don't we turn off the wells? Markets naturally handle supply and demand.  Oil production isn't that simple. The reason every country is sandbagging and trying to get other countries to cut oil is that there's a game theory element in play, as well as an oil well intrinsic function issue.\n\nOnce oil wells reduce their production to roughly 50-60% of output, they *cannot go any lower* without risking destroying the well, which is extraordinarily expensive to get the rights to drill on and also is like throwing out a gallon of water when you've only taken a sip. Thus, the only option to reduce further is to entirely stop production and cap the well, and then, assuming your lease on the well hasn't lapsed by the time you can re-open it, uncap it, both of which are extraordinarily expensive. Therefore, most oil companies are far, far better off continuing to produce oil at a loss, because that's still a long-term better play than turning off. Moreover, why the fuck should you be the well to turn off, if other's aren't? Add in the fact that everyone cheats on oil production cuts and the Saudis and Russians are trying to fuck each other and the US in the ass, and you've got a nice oil crisis.\n\nThis leads to the USO/UCO shit show and negative WTI price. Normally, futures holders offload their contracts to buyers who intend to actually take physical delivery as the option expiration date draws near. However, because there is no storage and no demand, none of the typical buyers actually wanted to buy, so you had a bunch of tendie seeking autists desperately trying to offload their contracts so that they wouldn't have 5 dumptrucks of oil barrels delivered to their homes and be completely fucked, such that they were willing to *pay* people (i.e. negative price) to take their contracts. As for contango, well, google it.\n\nFinally, this problem isn't going away any time soon because unless you're so truly deluded as to believe that we'll not only have a V shaped re-opening in terms of social, commercial, and consumer behavior, but that fuel consumption across airlines and cars will rebound immediately, we're on a long term path to recovery, and we're already out of supply. This is like having a clogged bathtub full of water and turning the faucet from 100% on to 50% on - you're still fucked until the faucet turns off (impossible) or the clog goes away more than enough to offset the faucet (not happening for a while). This is why experts broadly agree that [the OPEC+ cuts are meaningless](https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/4/21/opecplus-mega-deal-rendered-meaningless-by-demand-destruction) and that groups like Morgan Stanley believe [demand destruction of oil will persist until well into 2021](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Morgan-Stanley-Oil-Demand-Wont-Return-To-Normal-Until-End-2021.html).\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# SECTION 2: A brief overview of Tankers\n\nYou don't need much of a brain to understand, given the above, why tankers stand to benefit from demand destruction. However, there are many types of tankers, and it's not as obvious as hurr durr buy tankers. Each tanker type carries a different type of product, has a different size, and commands a different rate. Here is the current rates:\n\n[3 key types of tanker business models, spread across a variety of tanker variants](https://preview.redd.it/hd3q2ncaqmw41.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=fca616d8afc83afa14721af8e2e5bd1bf243fadd)\n\nAt this point I'm realizing that this post is getting way too long and i'm tired of typing it already, but do your own research on types of tankers. You can see though that tankers are commanding a stupidly high rate compared to their historical values:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q8u5q1odqmw41.jpg?width=1081&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5bc3668993ed1965a45f8c9af5a7a07f16e851b5\n\nThe current rates are so high that [one spot voyage is profitable on the entire year](https://www.tradewindsnews.com/tankers/tanker-rates-one-spot-voyage-makes-the-whole-year-in-red-hot-market/2-1-801368).\n\n>\"If an MR can get $30,000 per day on a spot voyage, it covers its costs for a year...If an LR2 gets $150,000 or $160,000 a day, it\u2019s the same...you could lay the ship up, earn zero for the next ten months, and still make a profit on the ship.\"\n\n[Guess who owns the most clean-fuel ready LR2's that are exposed to the spot price? $STNG](https://preview.redd.it/iyeeu45gqmw41.jpg?width=894&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b23175ca9c77eb406cadc5b01411c22545e72d59)\n\nNow, don't be stupid and assume that rates will hold this high all year. That said, even if rates went to $0 by mid summer, the rates for Q2 are so high such that it'd still be a higher revenue year than last year. And rates aren't going to $0...they're going to continue to stay above the historical average, just not as high as now, due to the crazy demand destruction.\n\n* **Miscellaneous point of clarification:** I see a lot of dumbasses posting about what numbers will look like if the entire fleet is booked out for, say, NAT. That's ridiculous and not how it works, so don't just go number of tankers x spot rate = revenue for year = tendies.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# SECTION 3: Why $STNG and $EURN?\n\nI really need to go fuck your wife soon, so I'm making the sections shorter and shorter. But i'll still tell you way $STNG and $EURN are good bets. First, let's start with NAV - Net Asset Value. If you don't know what this means, Google it.\n\nAs you (should) know, NAV is something you estimate and can be calculated differently based on different assumptions. Trading below NAV means the stock is underpriced as is, and that's before record earnings and guidance. By most accounts, $EURNs NAV is at least $13 currently, and $STNG is close to $30. They trade at $10 and $21, respectively, right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[$STNG isn't even at it's average price for 2019, but 2020 is objectively a better year unless a meteor blows up their fleet](https://preview.redd.it/smsydzfnqmw41.jpg?width=2001&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8b4de32295c00a853844ad5de51c44e7aeabbe0c)\n\nSecondly, fleet size and type. $STNG has one of the largest fleets in the world, and in particular, they have the most LR2 tankers. If you go back up to the graph, you'll see that clean LR2 tankers are commanding an absurd rate, spiking to as high as $250,000 for a few days and currently settled around $150-175k/day, compared to a 5-year historical value of below $25k. $EURN has a solid fleet of VLCC's which are commanding a strong rate, and EURN has good financials - most their boats are fairly new, they don't have a ton of debt.\n\nLastly, they're among the first up on the earnings block, with STNG reporting 5/6 this week and EURN reporting on 5/7. Compare that to NAT, who reports the 23rd, so theta will eat away at what remains of your atrophied testicles every day. That said, regardless of theta, STNG and EURN are really strongly positioned.\n\nI expect that earnings will be solid and likely beat, but not by a crazy amount because rates only started really jacking up in late March, and rates in early Q1 were actually pretty low. However, as many of you still don't fucking understand, **earnings don't matter nearly as much as** **guidance.** That's why you dumbfucks all complain about companies beating earnings but still tanking and then creating stupid conspiracy theories about \"MM is fucking rigging this market\". Guidance for tankers is going to be **euphoric**.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# SECTION 4: Why is $NAT a meme, and mistakes I see people making\n\nUltimately, this comes down to people angling towards the right space (tankers) but you've been too stupid to do any research. You probably do this for all your bets, because you're a fucking autist, but you should stop.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Fleet size misconception: Cramer meme'd NAT, infamously calling out that they have the largest fleet in the world. In fact, if you actually tried to verify anything you ever fucking did, you could have googled this and realized that NAT has a fleet that, just like your dick, is one of the smallest around. Moreover, they have the wrong type of boats - they primarily have Suezmax boats, which command an okay rate, but aren't close to the best boats to have right now.\n2. No investigation of NAV: NAT's NAV, by all accounts, is close to $3. They are trading at close to $6, and were nearing $8-9 at peak pump. Why the fuck on god's green earth would you buy a company with the wrong type of boats, the wrong fleet size, trading at over 2x NAV, when everyone else is around or below their NAV and has a better fleet?\n3. Massive debt and shitty assets: NAT is saddled in debt, is historically shittily managed (read their earnings report if you know how, but you probably don't know how), and all their boats are at the end of their lifetime, meaning NAT not only has horrible debt but will need to buy a shit ton of new boats very soon\n4. Stupid assumptions on revenue: We covered this earlier, but no, just because demand is high, it doesn't mean every boat is going to get booked at the spot price. Many boats are on existing contracted rates from last quarter, and the ones who are not are not all getting booked out at once.\n5. Looking at ATH as an indicator: If i see another one of you dumb fucks pointing out that NAT used to trade at $16 5 years ago, I will personally find you, tape you to a chair, and shit down your mouth. NAT has issued a shit ton more shares. You are probably the same group who thinks that USO went from $2 to $18 last week.\n\nThe ONLY justification for NAT is now that it's been memed and retail knows all about it, it will probably rise again if the other tankers do well. You can make that play, and you might even make money. Just make sure to dump that shit before earnings because they're not going to be good enough to justify the rise and there's going to be a stupid dump.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# MY POSITIONS:\n\nAs proof that I put money where my mouth is, I have \\~$20k riding in on these positions:\n\n\\- 40 $STNG 5/15 $23C\n\n\\- 200 $EURN 5/15 $12.5C\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# CONCLUSION:\n\nFuck you.
