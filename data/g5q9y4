But it seems that no one is talking about SPY falling like a rock to either a second bottom, or a completely new low.\n\nI have forecasted this for a minute  since its been setting up for days and have called this happening days in advance. I could post positions i took from today and screenshots of me telling friends spy is gonna drop this week + next week, but fuck you all youre getting is some crayon drawings as to why we fell in the first place, how you couldve seen this coming if you werent an anti-technicals autist, and where were going from here out out.\n\nbackground: i have 0 fundamental experience other than reading the shit you guys post on here, but i can guaran-fucking-tee you that the drop in the spy IS NOT a result of oil dropping you fuck. This has been setting up on TA for atleast a week if not since mid-late march and ill show you why, all you have to do is believe.\n\n1. Right off the bat you take a look at the futures (why futures? because it tells you the future you autist) and we can see that since last week, price has been forming an ascending wedge. What does this mean? It means that big players are offloading their position, forming a distribution pattern, one of such patterns is an ascending wedge which are followed by big drops in price (which we can see from today that price did indeed drop and will further).\n\n[ascending wedge + divergence](https://preview.redd.it/gxssbxpc29u41.png?width=1813&format=png&auto=webp&s=c45a399b1384dd803fc66742749d3e76f43f8008)\n\n2) in the picture above you can also see that once we broke and closed below the ascending trendline, we immediately retested it. AKA bull run is over, puts are boutta print, calls is for those who cant read between the lines.\n\nStill dont believe TA works?\n\n3) In the picture above you can also see that there is a divergence forming between the higher highs of price, and the lower highs of the MACDaddy indicator which further indicates that we are in a fucking distribution phase.\n\nStill dont believe in the power of TA?\n\nIn the picture below, we can also see that this drop is supported by price retracing to the 78.6% fib line... (no you dont draw fibs from the swing high to the swing low, thats not even how you fucking draw them). I dont particularly like fibs at all cuz i think its all horse shit and TeChNicAl aStRoloGy, but these drawings other than the fib are purely based off of price action patterns if you can read a chart. But if you do like astrology, then cool the fibs and any other 8-ball support this conclusion aswell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[fibs lining up](https://preview.redd.it/mqogtwra99u41.png?width=1826&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb3f63100d570edacbad43bb0e7a2377c423e985)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWanna know where were headed? Theres only two options. it can go up, or it can go down. But it cant go tits up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[the future](https://preview.redd.it/cgyfw6tx59u41.png?width=1810&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fdbc45fce5ae43e53e69219bdee989ddf207165)\n\nIn the picture above, were either dropping like a rock to below 220 yet again and that is unknown territory, or were dropping down to the 2529 to 2515 support range and bouncing up to 3250, then using this past weeks resistance as support at the 2900 range and then boom our economy is recovered, recession canceled.\n\nRegardless of what happens, whether you lose all your money listening to crayon drawings or listening to whoever has the most fundamental DD posts on wsb, these key levels drawn are to be respected. Big bet. screenshot this shit, im right or the market is rigged\n\noh and we had an uptick on the vix, which can only add support to my drawings.\n\nTLDR; VIX 60+, 200 spy puts go ahead shit on TA see if i care", "created_utc": 1587511913.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5q9y4/why_is_no_one_talking_about_spy_dropping_like_a/", "is_self": true}
