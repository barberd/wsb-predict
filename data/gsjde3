{"id": "gsjde3", "title": "Some Gordon DD", "selftext": "My fellow autists,\n\nOver the last week, I have grown increasingly invested in the predictions of our sage Gordon. In particular, I began wondering if what we are seeing is not exactly a prediction on the SPY change day over day.  So, I began assembling a matrix of predictions and stock movements. In this table, a prediction of down is given a value of -1, a prediction of up is given a value of 1.  For each stock, I look at the closing value with a value of 1 for up, -1 for down, and 0 for no change. Of course, further detail could be applied to implicate the magnitude of change, but it is not there yet. I picked a handful of stocks and indices semi at random to compare to SPY, UVXY, F, GE, SNAP, APHA, CRON, and AAL. What I have found is that while Gordon's predictions are correlated with the movement of SPY, they are significantly more correlated with APHA. To give an example, a correlation value of 0 would be random, and 1 would be a perfect match. Gordon's predictions since 5/13 have a SPY correlation of 0.21, and an APHA correlation of 0.81 (he was right 10/11 times). I will continue to expand the model and add further detail, but for now, I think that it is best to use the predictions for APHA options. I have attached a copy of my charts so far. Consequently, I also found that GE and AAL move even more in sync over the same timeframe with a correlation of 0.83, giving an opportunity to double down safely. Hopefully, we will soon find the stock, index, or ETF that Gordon has been signaling.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7jm3srfowl151.png?width=1512&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7cade1b7ba041b6fc34adc85b6f90ac85819096", "created_utc": 1590715872.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gsjde3/some_gordon_dd/", "is_self": true}
