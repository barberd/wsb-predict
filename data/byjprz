{"id": "byjprz", "title": "Time to enter an ANET position", "selftext": "So it seems ANET took a major hit last earning on lowered guidance. According to their earnings call and info from CML Viz \u201cone cloud titan has placed most orders on hold for Q2\u201d which means either that one customer switched to CSCO or has decided to cut back on quarterly expenditures. It seems as though the price drop was an overreaction on the lowered guidance which happened to coincide with the broader market correction in the NASDAQ. I\u2019m not sure why it\u2019s still getting pulled down, but it seems to have settled in at the 200MA. Anyhow Arista is eating into Cisco\u2019s market share and will most likely continue during the next few years as cloud services grow. I don\u2019t know if this is an options play into their next earnings or just a long play, but it seems like there is a trade here. I have no position currently but am seriously considering something for this coming week.
