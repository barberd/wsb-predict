Been watching various financial TV channels and reading articles all morning, and pretty much everyone says the same thing: there is not much upside in equities right now, and it's really hard to formulate a reasonable argument for the stock market to be up over the next months - years.\n\nSo here is the conundrum: every time the market randomly rallies, or ignores bad news, or moons on fake good news (e.g Gilead), my stance that this is a house of cards propped up by financial engineering gets even stronger. Everytime companies that are making next to no money right now take writedowns, slash guidance (or remove it altogether) and rally 5-10%, I tell myself that this can't be real. However, during that same time, my short positions are getting killed by theta and losing value on the upward moves. \n\nI have this fear that I will eventually be right - that if no one truly thinks the stock market is safe to invest in right now, it can't keep going up...but I will have lost so much money by that time & won't be able to capitalize on it. \n\nAny other bears in this exact situation where every upward move reaffirms your reason for being short but hurts your portfolio?", "created_utc": 1587395287.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g4uhb1/the_conundrum/", "is_self": true}
