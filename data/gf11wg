Double Duh. Now - time for our top 10 US e-commerce company dundie awards:\n\nAmazon (#1 in e-comm)\nWayfair (top 6 e-comm, u seen their chart lately?? I mean holy shit man)\nApple (#4 in e-comm)\nOther top 10s - Walmart Costco Target eBay Home Depot\n\nWho else?? MACYs. Yes, Macy\u2019s is in the top 10 too. Check me, it\u2019s a fact. Macy\u2019s is <$5/share, down 70% from pre covid days\n\nWhat I like: their CEO (36yr company man) is foregoing his salary, he\u2019s committed, they reach a broad spectrum of consumer, catering to higher end as well as bargain shoppers. Malls are fading but Macy\u2019s is coming out of this trim and focused. Dropping dead weight locations while keeping the winners, all while nursing that #10 TOP ONLINE ecomm website. 60% of us live within 10 miles of a store and 50% of Americans go in a Macys each year. Current mkt cap is 1.5B, that\u2019s 1/4th of last years online sales. Things are re opening, there\u2019s a vaccine in the works, good days and optimism will push this stock back up with good news\n\nCons: tough road ahead, brick and mortar sucks, will prob take an overall loss this year, some store closures bound to happen blah blah blah\n\nPrediction: the stock has passed $6 three times since the drop. Based on the way the line usually squiggles up and down, it looks to me like it probably wants to squiggle upward again. If we\u2019re at a 5 in month 5, I predict a 6 by month 6 and because a 70% drop is a BS cruise ship number, I think we\u2019ll see a 7 in month 7. Also saying that because I really like this number/month correlation prediction \n\n$6C June $7C July", "created_utc": 1588831676.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gf11wg/macys_is_a_top_10_us_ecommerce_site/", "is_self": true}
