UVXY calls in March, FVRR on the dip and a few other nicely timed bets. While I made a few K, I should be on a yacht, posting cringe IGs with Justin Beiber\u2019s ex girlfriends by now. I\u2019m a puss and never YOLO into anything, other than advice like \u201cgrow some bawls\u201d or \u201cstop being gay\u201d, can you tell me how you\u2019re able to take huge shots that expire next week? I need some inspiration from you psychopaths.\n\nThanks.", "created_utc": 1591870424.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h0wj2s/advice_to_someone_who_doesnt_have_the_bawls/", "is_self": true}
