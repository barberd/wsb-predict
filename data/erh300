{"id": "erh300", "title": "My Semicon DD", "selftext": "Hey guys Jarvi here, you may remember me from such films as \"Disaster after AMD's ER\" and \"Disaster after AMD's ER part 2\"   \n\n\nWell i hope you all are ready for part 3.\n\nCPU TALK\n\n\\--------\n\nMost cpu/graphics drivers are in fact not optimized for Nvdia/Intel contrary to popular opinion.\n\n$AMD has made the last 2 generations of APUs(ps3,ps4,, xbox1) for consoles and now they're making the next gen ones also.\n\nMost games are developed for consoles and optimized to perform well on consoles because of their custom OS; they are able to have access to the lower level hardware more efficiently than say a general purpose os like linux/windows.\n\nFor comparison, the only other manufacturer able to do this is $Apple because they make both their own hardware and software so the devices they make operate really well and smooth.\n\nSo what im driving at here is that most games are devloped with $AMD hardware in mind because most games also release on consoles, there are very few PC exclusives.\n\nAMD will use their place as an industry leader to also promote the desktop gaming environment. Zen3 CPUS(RYZEN 4000) has now been leaked showing another 30% performance improvement over Zen2(Ryzen 2000 and 3000 series) CPUs on a 7nm+ node. \n\n\\--------\n\nGPU TALK\n\n\\--------\n\nI have speculated the big navi was coming early this year because 7nm nodes at TSMC($TSM) have now been shown to have above a 90% yield rate meaning for every 100 chip produced, 90 work. Samsung and Intel fabs have much lower yeilds. leaks show that Samsung 7nm is at 30% yeilds.([https://twitter.com/chiakokhua/status/1208385778486628353?s=20](https://twitter.com/chiakokhua/status/1208385778486628353?s=20))\n\nNow we know for sure that big navi is coming and we are looking at more than 400mm\\^2 die chips. The 5700xt die size is 252mm\\^2; that means big navi has more than 2.5 times the die size as the 5700xt. Get ready for some serious performance out of AMD GPUs. Without yields being 90%+ on 7nm this would not be possible.\n\n\\--------------\n\nFAB HOUSE TALK\n\n\\--------------\n\nSo now Apple, ARM, AMD, Nvidia, and now recently reveled Intel(for their dGPU - [https://adoredtv.com/exclusive-intel-second-generation-dg2-gpu-to-use-tsmcs-7nm-node/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=ios\\_app](https://adoredtv.com/exclusive-intel-second-generation-dg2-gpu-to-use-tsmcs-7nm-node/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)) are using $TSM's fab. TSM is fully booked for their 7nm process and now Apple is booking them for their 5nm node. AMD and TSM have a monopoly on their respective markets right now.\n\nMy hot take is $70+ for TSM([https://www.tradingview.com/x/PnNWs2oW/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/PnNWs2oW/)) and $80+ for AMD( [https://www.tradingview.com/x/2rdtOCur/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/2rdtOCur/)) by 4/17/20.\n\nI linked my sources but for any of the other bullshit I said, just take my word for it, I'm a computer engineer and I'm totally a valid source.", "created_utc": 1579544091, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/erh300/my_semicon_dd/", "is_self": true}
