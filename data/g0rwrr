Because if the day is not trending then it should reverse and usually it does and even goes further then the point it started from(breaks VWAP). And most days are not trending.\nWhy 1:1. Because it's hard to time the top. If you buy somewhere you think is the top.then you can easily miss and will need to sell at a loss. If you wait for confirmation of a reversal it's already too late because it's market open and everything is flying quickly + options prices are definately not suited for buying a breakout because expectation of a break out or reversal makes prices higher.\nThe best think is to catch a falling knife with options or at least wait for a pull back but never to buy when it goes your direction.\n\nFor better win rate you could even increase a risk. A stop loss here is only for not losing everything when a trending day comes.\n\nAlso I see that after 1,2 trending days there are 3,4 days of consolidation where this strategy would work best.\n\nUsing ATR to know if it has gone far enough from VWAP to buy.\n\nAnyone tried it?", "created_utc": 1586812837.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0rwrr/11_risk_reward_intraday_strategies_not_scalping/", "is_self": true}
