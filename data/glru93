Pelley is the interviewer\n\nJpow- \u201cThe big thing we have to avoid during that period is a second wave of the virus. But if we do, then the economy can continue to recover.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThere is almost definitely going to be a second wave. \n\n\n\n\n\nJpow continues-\u201cWe'll see GDP move back up after the very low numbers of this quarter. We'll see unemployment come down. But I think though it'll be a while before we really feel, well recovered.\u201d\n\n\n\nPELLEY: But the shrinkage of GDP in the second quarter, what numbers are you looking at?\n\nPOWELL: \u201c.... You know, could easily be in the twenties or thirties.\u201d\n\n\nPELLEY: If the economy reopens and the infection rate surges, what then?\n\n\nPOWELL: \u201cWell, the risk would be that you would have to reintroduce, the government would have to reintroduce, the social distancing measures. And that you would have another downturn. And that would be bad for confidence. So that's a risk we really want to avoid. And I think we can avoid.\u00a0\n\nIt comes down to people needing to be careful about their behavior because, you know, the virus hasn't gone away. It's still out there. And if -- the reason that cases have gone down and are declining is because people have been in their homes and not in their businesses and not out among crowds.\n\n--if we start, if we go back without observing the right protective measures, then it's possible, the experts say, that we would have a second wave. And that would be very damaging to have to reintroduce the measures and slow the economy down again. That would be quite damaging to the economy and also to public confidence.\u201d\n\nPELLEY: How important, in your view, is it to avoid that?\n\n\nPOWELL: \u201cIt's very important to avoid that. Very important.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nLater\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPELLEY: As we discussed earlier in the interview, the pandemic has illuminated some of the disparities in our economy. And I wonder what you would like to see on the back end of this, when we begin to repair the damage?\n\n\n\nJpow- ..\u201dYou know, at the Fed, we will do everything we can to get the economy back in expansion mode, and to keep it there for a long period of time. I don't want to think though that we'll take years and years to get back to a place where we have a tight labor market, and that's what it takes to really get opportunities to less advantaged communities, low- and moderate-income communities.\u201d\n\n\n\nkey words \u201cwouldnt want to think\u201d.\n\nHere are the final words for the interview\n\n\n\n\n\nPELLEY: Finally, what metrics are you looking at here hour by hour, day to day, to divine what the future is going to be?\n\nPOWELL: \u201cYou know, at the moment, the thing that matters more than anything else is the medical metrics, frankly. It's the spread of the virus. It's all the things associated with that. Of course, we're also looking at the employment data.\n\n\nBut in a sense, the real-time economic data that we're seeing is just a function of how successful the social distancing measures are. So the data we'll see for this quarter, which ends in June, will be very, very bad. There'll be a, you know, big decline in economic activity, big increase in unemployment. But in a sense, those are a byproduct. So what we're really looking at is getting the medical data, which is not what we usually look at, taken care of so that the economic data can start to recover. And that we think can happen as soon as the third quarter.\u201d\n\nPELLEY: Do you have a direct connection to the CDC? Where does this information come to you from?\n\n\nPOWELL: \u201cYou know, we don't have people on staff here who have made their living doing that. But of course we've had lots and lots of contact with experts, both at the staff level and I've talked to a number of experts in the area on an ongoing basis. So we do check in with the real experts, and get their best thinking. But they will tell you that there's a lot of uncertainty about this.\u201d\n\n\n\nDoesnt sound good to me ladies and gents\n\n\nEdit: i posted this mostly after seeing all the jpow shits money posts and green monday!!
