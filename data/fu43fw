From what I can tell, America is still up and running. I mean, I'm sitting at home playing league with my friends all day. A couple are recent grads working from home (I'm a neet Robinhood trader). I still order takeout and live my life and all this time..... 6 MILLION PEOPLE ARE UNEMPLOYED.\n\nIt seems to me companies will never go back to their pre covid-19 ways. Lots of people will just continue to work from home after this is over. But I fear lots of jobs will never come back.
