While having SP500 at 3000 would be very helpful for avoiding those bad things, I believe there is no need for that. My reasons are below:\n\n1. All the vulnerable and \"systematically important\" institutions like the airlines, Boeing already got their capital raises and bailout packages. They will still be in tough spots but at this point they will make it for at least the next 3-6 months, and they will keep many people on their payroll still.\n\n2. Banks have very healthy balance sheet after 2008 and Basel III, and they directly benefit the most from all the alphabet soup facilities the Feds put up.\n\n3. Otherwise most companies already took opportunities to sell bonds and notes to beef up their balance sheet for an extended downturn.\n\n4. Oil is another story but everyone already written them off nor can the Feds really do anything about them without outright bailing them out since there's no more room to store any. If anything this is an opportunity to purge some of the misallocated capital that's politically feasible to reallocate.\n\n5. Don't see another case of Ronin Capital which got liquidated presumably because they were massively short vol with VIX being so elevated for the past 2 weeks. Presumably all the firms out there have adjusted their positions to avoid getting margin called when the market goes down by 20%. Similarly with risk parity funds which has deleveraged as well.\n\nIf the data and guidance from earning calls are bad, then market will go down and the Feds won't like it. Because data and guidance are lagging, the stock market and the real economy can become disconnected on the order of weeks to months. Which is what I believe the past few weeks has been.\n\nHowever, at this point the Fed has done much more than what anyone expected. The focus is definitely on the economic data, and to a lesser extent guidance, which the Feds and even Congress and the executive can hardly do anything about. I doubt MSFT, NFLX and TSLA will be able to carry this market on their own, and my feeling is that positive surprises from them are more \"priced in\" than the negative ones right now.\n\nMy price predictions is IWM to 100 and SPY 2400 by July. I also see VIX spiking to 50 sometime then.\n\nI recommend picking up options few months out on days where IV/VIX are low, and gamma scalp them when prices of the underlying moves, even if you don't entirely delta hedge.\n\nAlso, to long term bears out there, with 30 year Treasury zero coupon rates at 1.5%, which is 50bp below the 2% symmetric inflation target the Fed has, I think SPY is priced very reasonably even around 2800 unless you think we will see long term negative EPS growth after inflation.\n\nNotable positions IWM put June 31 $110, July 17 Put $108, 12k in TZA, 4.5k in SPXU. Which ends up being about 60k notional short equity exposure.", "created_utc": 1586959014.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1se39/spy_retesting_the_bottom_in_an_orderly_fashion_is/", "is_self": true}
