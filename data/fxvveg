Sell your puts on the next red day.\n\n**Credentials:** Started options trading with 25K back in Oct 2019. Made small gains then moderate losses. Then hit big with TSLA in February, pulled out 5K, then hit big again from SPY puts from the initial market crash. My account ATH was 52.5K (47.5K+5K withdrew). I'm currently still positive from my initial investment, but barely.\n\n**Here's my current skin in the game:**\n\n[portfolio](https://preview.redd.it/z9atagf0jtr41.jpg?width=830&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db541db8667f4d8a7ea8290f3d99283f97db8a11)\n\nSo after getting repeatedly fucked by JPOWs BRRR, and after seeing all of the fundamentals just get completely ignored by the markets (record employment, more rona deaths, closed companies make no money, etc), I've decided I need to change my gameplan because the MarKets CaN rEMaIn irRAtionAl lONgER ThAN YoU CaN Say sOlvent and I refuse to be one of the diamond handers who loses their entire portfolio for some WSB loss porn karma.\n\nAll of us 5/15 put holders are sweating. Hard. Like this is literally me, right now:\n\n[actual photo of me in this moment](https://preview.redd.it/rnfh9dscjtr41.jpg?width=479&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=32251b8b6049c1b8772e24a4f703c6517e50769e)\n\nAnd this is also me, from a different angle:\n\n[another actual photo](https://i.redd.it/to6809ifjtr41.gif)\n\nAnyway, here are my thoughts with my new gameplan for tendies, but also with a DISCLAIMER so DYODD (*Do Your Own Due Diligence*, I'm fucking coining this):\n\n# DISCLAIMER:\n\n[I might be retarded](https://preview.redd.it/v16n0k88jtr41.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a601376019e08522e9f49b62fb02bb755a676385)\n\nSo why are the markets acting this way? Why do we keep getting worse and worse news about the economy and the coronavirus, yet stonks still go up. Why are we sitting at 2019 levels of SPX?\n\n**The Initial Market Reaction to Corona:**\n\nWell we need to take a look at just a couple months back to see. The US markets were late to the game when it came to reacting to the coronavirus. Remember when we all saw [the avalanche coming from China](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-23/china-expands-travel-limits-who-says-virus-remains-local-crisis) in December/January? We saw an entire country, one of the largest economies in the world, SHUT DOWN and people were being welded inside their homes and yet, our markets continued to rise. We thought the coronavirus had become \"priced in.\" It wasn't until weeks later when the virus made a hotspot in Italy, and the first cases popped in the US, did we start to take it seriously. That was late February. So it took around 2 months after we learned about the virus before it finally affected the market. Remember this fact for later...\n\nSo what changed during that time to make the markets react? After all, the virus hadn't changed. It was still just as lethal, just as infectious. Well, it was because the world was in denial about the virus coming to our doorstep. We all knew we were going to have company staying over for weeks and we didn't decide to clean the house until they rang the doorbell. And when they rang the doorbell, they actually used an axe to bang through the door because we didn't wanna let them in.\n\n[\\\\\"Don't come in, I haven't cleaned the bathroom yet!\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/60msmr3xjtr41.jpg?width=641&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f27b8efb4cf0daecd45070bbabb34384f10a4653)\n\nThe initial crashes and circuit breakers was the manifestation of our scrambling last minute. It was all panic selling due to uncertainty about the virus AND uncertainty about the economic backbone holding us up. I'm not an economist, nor am I an expert on all the flaws in our economy, but I've read a lot of DD that basically said our economy has been propped up on fake bullshit for decades and at some point, someone's gotta take the pain. It just so happens that the people in charge decide to kick the can down the road and let the future generations deal with it...every. single. fucking. time.\n\nAnd Trump of all people is definitely trying to do this. What the fuck does INFINITE QE mean? It means fake monopoly money that people won't realize is fake until the NEXT recession pops. Who knows when that'll be! Will we get ANOTHER 11 year big dick bull run before we see the cracks breaking again? I don't know! And neither do you!\n\n[\\\\\"Gape my asshole, JPOW!\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/tnb6czqgltr41.jpg?width=531&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1278205b2fa6bae95e1db5d7c98fcfe7b3f22f72)\n\n**The Future of SPY:**\n\nI am convinced that we will retest the bottom before we return to a full blown bull market. But what events do we need to see before that happens? At this point, the market has \"priced in\" all the possible carnage from Rona. Cases and death numbers are not affecting anything and it seems ANY good news is enough to make it a green day.\n\nSo that means we need economic indicators to put the direction of the market. Unemployment seems to be \"priced in,\" every non-essential company losing profits is still somehow rising with the market (DIS closed all of their parks and 80% of their revenue but [surges after surprise D+ subscriber data](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/disneys-stock-surges-to-give-the-dow-a-near-40-point-boost-after-surprise-disney-subscriber-data-2020-04-09)), and the oil crisis seems to be awaiting the next bit of news before we react.\n\nSo what can possibly make the markets go down? Remember earlier when I said to remember that the markets were late to react to the Rona? My theory is that we HAVEN'T fully priced in the unemployment and negative balance sheets yet. Like the initial Rona news, these things haven't made their way to our doorstep.\n\nUnemployment hasn't been priced in because we haven't had millions of people default on their loans, mortgages, etc. We haven't seen poor people in food lines on a national scale (in some places this has popped up, but it's not ubiquitous yet). Homelessness hasn't hit a breaking point. There aren't any riots \\[yet\\] and **people still have hope**.\n\n[Fuck you Obi-Wan!](https://preview.redd.it/gvug8ehxmtr41.jpg?width=454&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=13c5a844ca449eefaa40b616c72b2af4ed6cdf97)\n\nEarnings season is coming up in the next weeks and this is where we will get a taste of the carnage. Keep in mind that early Q1, there were only supply disruptions, but demand was still steady. Quarantines didn't start until March in most places so these earnings numbers may appear rosier than we initially thought. What does that mean? More green dildos to fuck you.\n\nI don't think the markets will fully price in the effects of the economic recession until Q2 earnings, which won't happen until mid-September.\n\n**So what now?**\n\nI was up over 100% gains when the market hit bottom over 2 weeks ago. Like you, I put a shit ton of those profits into more SPY puts.\n\nBUT...\n\nI am now convinced that JPOWs Infinite QE will wipe my 5/15 puts to zero and going negative from my initial $25K is past my personal risk tolerance. My plan is to sell on the next red day, take the loss and learn my lesson. While I ice my sore asshole, I will be cash gang because theta and vega keep fucking these options and playing any sort of longer dated position is simply foolish under these current conditions. I might day-trade and follow the advice of u/settanitti who advises [daytrading for a bunch of +3%](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxdovm/wanna_make_some_money_read_this/) instead of praying for a big FD. It looks like doing day-by-day plays will be better for both my wallet and my sanity.\n\nLesson learned, Fed. Lesson learned. But still a fuck, flaming fuck you goes out to the Trump Administration for fucking my generation even more.\n\nThank you for coming to my TEDTalk and good luck with making tendies.", "created_utc": 1586450888.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxvveg/for_all_of_you_may_and_june_spy_put_holders/", "is_self": true}
