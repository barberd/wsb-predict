{"id": "e63uk4", "title": "Shitty Credit Options?", "selftext": "GUH I just looked up my credit score for the first time - it's apparently like 550. I'm pretty sure that's pretty bad but I don't know why because I've never had a credit card. Anyways, I wanted to apply for a credit card maybe a loan; however, that seems to be out of the question now.  \n\n\nThis brings me to my discussion. If I'm already in such a shitty spot credit wise( as far as I know ), and I'm sufficiently leveraged to live day to day with plenty of cash, secure income, and a robinhood account waiting for approval which will probably be worth millions by EOY - would it be worth just finding any loan that will give me something? I found one that was (lmfao I don't know credit but listen to this) 199% fixed APR for a 2,000 loan, monthly minimum payment of $430 for 10 months.  \n\n\nIf declaring bankruptcy doesn't change much from my shitty credit score, am I wrong for just saying haha hehe, taking a few other loans on for free loot then bailing on it all? If not I'm thinking about defaulting on the aforementioned offer just because fuck them that's an insane scam aimed at 18 year olds.  \n\n\nLet me know, also \"unrelated\" please list lottery ticket ideas for some options to keep this a healthy discussion. Thanks team!
