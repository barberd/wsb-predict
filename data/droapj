It gives DIS a P/E ratio of around 23 whereas AAPL not only has a lower PE (20) but also has higher growth prospects making it a better investment than DIS.\n\nMark my words- AAPL will outperform DIS.", "created_utc": 1572901995, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/droapj/prediction_dis_will_matchbeat_earnings_and_still/", "is_self": true}
