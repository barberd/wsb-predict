I should have sold this morning for some decent gains. I rolled the last 2k of that into SPY 7/17 290p.\n\nI decided to yolo another 2k at close into 7/17 CHMA 10c.\n\nI\u2019m also sitting on 7/17 DGLY 5c. I\u2019m currently down 5k on those and down to my last 1k. I might as well hold those until expiration.\n\nIm either going to make everything back by 7/17, or lose most of my account and retire from this before I totally blow my account up. \n\nGood luck to all of you beautiful people and godspeed fellas!", "created_utc": 1593149607.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hg1tf3/fuck_it/", "is_self": true}
