{"id": "e213ba", "title": "HP vs Dell ? Both after hours earnings. Both companies have huge swing potential", "selftext": "Since the MSFT expiration on their windows 10 happened recently, I can see companies upgrading PCs to become more compatible with new operating software. The three largest PC makers are Lenovo, HP and and Dell by order. \n\nI am bullish on them but some risks pose. As I mentioned in a previous post, HP is more of a gamble.  Digitization is making printers less needed so there should be a decline, that is priced in. I think they might beat this earnings or have good news to show. Rejecting  Xerox's $22 per share takeover bid as too low makes me believe they think the shareholders will back them.\n\nWith that said, business investment is down overall across the board. Dell is exposed to cloud market segment which is stagnant overall as seen by CISCO's latest report.  \n\nMy theory is quite  undeveloped. I would appreciate some insight.", "created_utc": 1574788815, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e213ba/hp_vs_dell_both_after_hours_earnings_both/", "is_self": true}
