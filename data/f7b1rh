Why Silver? Well if the economy goes up that is good for silver for starters. Care to guess what will drive up the silver market? ELECTRIC CARS. That\u2019s right all those $100 car deposits Papa Musk received will be used to buy all silver Tesla cars will need. Seriously though, silver and clean energy are already married and are going to have baby cars with solar panels for years to come. Demand for silver is only going up exponentially. There isn\u2019t debate on that funny enough. But if you are an idiot you can try to argue that with yourself. If economy tanks, interest rates go to zero and that is a HUGE win for all precious metals.\n\nHere is the real DD on AG, it has in the past few weeks been lagging industry peers like PAAS, yet that isn\u2019t exactly common looking at it historically. WHY has it lagged? Earnings weren\u2019t astronomically great (great compared to 2018 though). But I did my research, the company has gone through major cost-cutting ventures of closing big old mines, while at the same time being at the forefront of the technology used for mining. In the second half of 2019, they installed the two first-ever High-Intensity Grinding Mill in Latin America making the recoveries go from 88% percent to 96% \u2026that means an extra 600,000 to 800,000 ounces of silver for free for this year, so if you do the stupid math with silver currently trading at $18.5 that\u2019s an extra $14,800,000 in revenue. They also have another 2 of these High-Tech Grinding Mills on the process of being installed as of now. So more free money\n\nLooking back why did it go up nearly 100% these past few months? Besides AG improving their margins from 2018-2019\u2026 Silver went from $14 to $18. To them, that meant an extra $100,000,000 which went into improving their bottom line and funding into new technology. A similar price move with their new structure should create a monster Tendies opportunity. Even autists can look at a chart of SLV and know which direction silver price is going in the very-near-immediate-short-term-future. Couple the fact is AG produced a record of 25.6 million ounces in 2019 and is in line to break the record again in 2020 according to management.\n\nBUT why should you trust Management? The CEO: Keith Neumeyer was freaking voted CEO of the year by industry investors during the BMO Global Metals &amp; Mining conference a couple of months back. I ask you this: You think the people\u2019s choice CEO in the mining industry is fucking it up compared to his other Mining CEO peers? This thing is about to take off. I own about $37,800 in stock shares and $2,685 in OTM Options with July and January strikes.\n\nDo what you wish with this info.
