{"id": "dwvigs", "title": "The Fed is blowing a bubble. I am bearboi. I don't like it. But what else can they even do?", "selftext": "We are in full on bubble mode right now, \"melting up\" in spite of any bad/negative news because the Fed has gone tits up on even the smallest bit of hawkishness. Every dip in major indexes this year has been met with some sort of coaching from jaypow and friends reminding the market that they will cut, or restart QE, whatever it takes to \"extend the expansion.\"\n\nTo a *sophisticated* WSB trader like myself this seems farcical. No different in terms of execution than when NBEV says \"hey we're doing CBD drank\" and rockets themselves to the moon. Only difference is the Fed is able to ACTUALLY print/run all stonks up, and it isn't a temporary pump and dump. It's a pump in perpetuity. Inflation be damned (and that line is what set off this most recent breakout).\n\nI understand the bearboi state of mind. This is a bubble, and they are inflating it. There are consequences. But what would the alternative even be? 12/18 showed any return to balance sheet normalcy would erase all stonk gains from 2010 onwards. Stopping the printer now guarantees a true slowdown. I feel like to be a true condescending bear I need to be able to say what the Fed *should* be doing, not just what they're doing wrong...what say you, autists?\n\nNo more cuts until a true slowdown? No not-QE? How do you unwind this level of intervention? Or should I just accept the Fed is going to lose control, spark aggressive inflation, shit the bed on the entire economy and usher in a socialist post-Trump world?\n\nTLDR:\nreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee", "created_utc": 1573845723, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dwvigs/the_fed_is_blowing_a_bubble_i_am_bearboi_i_dont/", "is_self": true}
