{"id": "hc0tu4", "title": "[DD] Ride HOG into the fucking ground on Monday", "selftext": "Listen up retards because I have the play of the week for you: **HOG puts.**\n\n*Disclaimer: I may be autistic but I'm not your fucking rain-man, do your own DD, this isn't financial advice it's gambling.*\n\n#The play\n\nIn case you didn't know, everyone's least favourite boomercycle manufacturer is finally getting the boot from the S&P 500 on June 19th after market close.\n\nsource: https://www.jsonline.com/story/money/2020/06/15/milwaukee-based-harley-davidson-removed-s-p-500/3194719001/\n\nI don't need to tell you why HOG is garbage, you've read all the posts by now and you know that they're zombie boomer shit. Loud bikes, way too expensive, no one has jobs and all their customers are dead now from batsoup flu. **DOG SHIT.** What's new about this play is that we now get to play the rebalancing between the huge S&P500 funds and their relatively small S&P400 counterparts.\n\n**Big ETF indexes are rebalancing on June 22nd.**\n\nsource: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-09/state-street-delays-shaking-up-world-s-biggest-etf-on-volatility\n\nThis means that on June 22nd your biggest ETFs and passive funds are going to dump HOG like the hot garbage it is. We're talking capital outflow from HOG heavier and wetter than your wife's panties when her boyfriend rolls up on his Ducati.\n\nLet's take alook at the total HOG holdings of the top S&P 500 ETFS and mutual funds (VFINX, VOO, FXAIX, SPY, IVV and SWPPX). **The total number of HOG shares owned by these whales is \u224814.2 M shares. Average daily volume for HOG is 4.6M, that's 3.2x avg volume which has to be dumped because robot says sell.**\n\nYou say:\n\n*Wait a minute Mr. Thicc, won't all those shares be picked up by the mid-cap ETFs when HOG moves into the midcap S&P 400?*\n\nI say:\n\nFirst of all that's Dr. Thicc to you, and second of all no they won't because mid-cap ETFs are little virgin $10B funds next to the $500B Chad funds that are the S&P 500 ETFS. Limpdick S&P400 doesn't have the market cap to absorb all of the outflow from big-dick VOO and SPY. They're smaller because retail investors don't want to put their 401ks in loser mid-caps when they can invest in the FAGMAN S&P 500.\n\nAdding up some of the larger S&P400 midcap funds (MDY, IJH, VO, WIR, IJK, IJJ, SPMD) you get \u2248$122.8B in AUM. **HOG's $3.9 B market cap divided through the $1.63T market cap of the S&P400 means it'll capture 0.23% of those funds, so that rolls up to around \u224811.7M shares leaving a deficit of 2.5M shares that the big boys have to sell, but the mid-cap ETFs can't eat up.** For those of you still counting that's half of the average daily volume that will need to be sold at a discount.\n\nWhat does this mean for you? It means short-dated HOG puts will print on June 22nd when the indexes rebalance by dumping HOG shares and pumping the IV through the roof. And once that happens you can bet your last Adderal that the Marketwatch and CNBC robo-writers will be there to keep the pain going with their negative sentiment \"HOG Shares Down On Exit From S&P500\" headlines.\n\nDogshit company, garbage bikes, and they're about to get personally buttfucked by Vanguard and BlackRock.\n\nHOG 6/26 22.5p and HOG 6/26 23.5 p are the plays, grab a plate, clench your ass over the weekend, and join me for the HOG roast on Monday.\n\n\n**TL:DR** Big dick S&P500 ETFs have to dump HOG on June 22 when it gets demoted. Limpdick S&P400 ETFs can't absorb the capacity, so buy HOG 6/26 23.5p and HOG 6/26 22.5p and make it rain tendies of boomer tears.", "created_utc": 1592573869.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hc0tu4/dd_ride_hog_into_the_fucking_ground_on_monday/", "is_self": true}
