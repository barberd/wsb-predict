{"id": "gde0bb", "title": "Aggressive/Unusual Options Flow for today", "selftext": "Here is the options data for today, these orders i found the most aggressive and unusual with repeating orders for several tickers most of it being short term. Watch the OI tomorrow and see if these contracts go into OI or not.\n\nHere - [https://imgur.com/a/0vUE3Qj](https://imgur.com/a/0vUE3Qj)\n\nAAL for this friday looking really aggressive, that is to be expected though since Buffet pooed on them and all airlines over the weekend. The IV is really high especially for friday, but that's not stopping the orders from coming in on and above the ask in sweep/block trades.\n\nDisney has modest bearish orders, for the 15th. I see these having more potential as it gives more time than AAL and not too much OTM.\n\nServiceNow calls, unsure what that is but seeing calls with OTM aggression for this and next week needing a big move.\n\nAlso all these orders volume of the contracts exceeded the OI so it's most likely not closing positions.  Either buy to open orders or sell to open orders and  based on the aggressiveness of the orders one can infer its buy to open.  Some of these may be hedges and some most likely not.\n\nDon't just  enter YOLO's in  positions based on this data alone in most cases.  Use    technicals/fundamentals/options data/market feelings all combined instead of just 1 of these. Use protection like spreads if you worry about losing what u put in and be smart, understand the risks of   putting $ into weekly expiry's, consider a longer expiry.  Learn IV AND IV CRUSH!\n\nWe are in uncertain times so do proper DD.", "created_utc": 1588607349.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gde0bb/aggressiveunusual_options_flow_for_today/", "is_self": true}
