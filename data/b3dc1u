Seems like a good short bet, HLF is basically a MLM and gravity always catches up to those.  \nAckman made a big point to short this several years ago, pissed off some people in the process and they crushed him on it.

Maybe jig is up and Ackman's time has come?", "created_utc": 1553095540, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b3dc1u/time_to_short_hlf/", "is_self": true}
