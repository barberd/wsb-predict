Yes I know they are paying off suppliers and gathering resources to fight the beer flu but does this not at least make sense?\n\nI\u2019m talking way OTM puts. Not just OTM but like a fish out of water move. \n\nLMT 220p 4/17 can be bought for .01 so why not just through like 20-30 down for contracts and worst case you lose 20-30 bucks and if you can afford that you have a lot more issues to take care of than buy anything right now but best case the market drops next week and you at least will put some gains into the portfolio to wager on more SPY phoots. \n\nThis would not be my most autistic move but will definitely fight for one of the top spots \n\nTDLR:LMT 220p 4/17", "created_utc": 1585337433.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fq3thc/call_me_whatever_you_want_but_be_more_original/", "is_self": true}
