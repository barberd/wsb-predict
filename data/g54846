My question is, I have a Put that expires 4/24. I looked into selling it today but RH warned me that it would create another 90 day buy restriction. So what will happen on 4/24? Will RH auto sell it for me..? Will I have the same penalty no matter what? I really fucked myself here.", "created_utc": 1587426500.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g54846/rh_pattern_day_trader_question/", "is_self": true}
