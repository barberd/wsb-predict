People aren't spending money which means they have more money in the bank. So you fire up Robinhood because you think you're hot shit(and you are, literally). You dump that 15-20% you're saving each month into HRTZ and NKLA and AAL, because for some reason you like more shit. Eventually the lockdown ends, your wife asks you to pay for her date with her bf. You try to take the money out but guess what, so does everybody else. Market go down.\n\nYou might say, what about 15% unemployment? Well, most of those 15% never had the capital to make a dent in the market anyway. It's a kangaroo market because millennials are getting blue balls from cash in the bank.", "created_utc": 1592728100.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hd3e0r/why_i_think_the_market_is_going_up_and_wont/", "is_self": true}
