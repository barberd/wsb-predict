{"id": "fwdiy9", "title": "Insight into the CoVid data that nobody is talking about.", "selftext": "These are my claims from looking at the virus data myself:\n\n1. The number of new cases US-wide is indeed plateauing. But don't get too bull happy. To be clear, this means that **the \\*rate\\* of new cases will no longer increase as we have seen**. This is a consequence of social distancing put in place \\~13 March (24 days ago). Following the incubation period (4-12 range, mean 5) and duration of symptoms (10-14 days), this makes sense. Lombardi, Italy, began practicing social distancing around 28 Feb and the data shows that they also flattened the \\*rate\\* of new cases by March 18 (22 days).\n2. **There is a medium-pace and steady descent in new cases once the rate plateaus**. Not groundbreaking, but at what rate does it descend? In Lombardi from 20 March to 06 April (17 days), the number of new cases per day dropped steadily from zero (plateau) to \\~60%, specifically from \\~2400 to \\~1080 new cases per day. On a NY/US timeline, this means that the number of new cases per day will drop in NY from \\~20,000 (the current plateau) to \\~8,000/day and in the US from \\~30,000 to \\~12,000. In total cases that translates to \\~250,000 in NY and \\~800,000 in the US on 23 April. Bookmark this shit. My estimate 2 weeks ago was that the US would get between 400,000-700,000 cases. My estimate was too low.\n3. Ahead I am going to explain what is probably the most important phenomena that virtually everyone overlooks when interpreting that virus data. **Number of new tests must be considered to interpret something credible from number of new cases**. **Hence, the steep drop of new cases that occurred over Sat, 04 April and Sun, 05 April was largely due to the coinciding drop in new tests.** Sites such as Johns Hopkins and World-meters do not include new tests, so autists and non-autists alike are  wrongly led to believe that the number of new cases nosedived.  I argue that it is because the number of new tests plummeted, not \\*necessarily\\* the number of new cases. The inverse is also true.  (To the naysayers, positivity rate is 45% in NY, so it follows that more people would test positive if more tests were readily available, and vice versa.)\n\nWhy is this significant? This is big, so stay with me. The number of reported new cases dropped from 23,101 to 18,659 from last Saturday to Sunday. That\u2019s a 23% drop. Everyone looking at that leans optimistic and the bull parade is initiated. But-- \\*There was concurrently a 19% drop in new tests. On Sunday night Trump tweets \u201clight at the end of the tunnel\u201d. The market rallies Monday morning 7%. **New tests are not properly being accounted for by the general audience to follow the new cases trend line.** The statisticians who know this are not explaining the nuances to the general public. Have you noticed how no statistical expert has declared an apex or plateau?\n\nStill don\u2019t buy it? The exact same scenario happened a weekend ago. There was a 15% drop in new tests from Sat-Sun and the market rallied 4% on Monday morning. The weekend before that? There actually wasn\u2019t a significant drop in new tests; there was an increase over the weekend as US testing was ramping up. On Monday the market responded red. No new test reduction = no new case reduction = no green Monday.\n\nMy guess is that there is a logistic factor occurring over Saturday and Sunday to explain the drop in new tests over the weekend.\n\nFurther evidence--. Remember on March 24th when Trump said on the White House lawn that the country would be open in Easter. There was a 23% reduction in newly reported tests that day (and, of course, a -16% reduction in newly reported cases).\n\nLast point then I have my final and practical takeaway. When the number of new tests/new cases drop, it shoots up the day and/or two. On Tuesday, March 31 new tests in NY increased 33% from the previous day. The SPY closed lower that Tuesday (-1.5%) and Wednesday (-4.3%) . Two days after trumps Easter comment, on March 26th, new tests day over day increased 53%. The Spy responded by dropping -3.6%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFollow the logic with me:\n\n1. The SPY is corresponding to the number of new cases.\n2. The number of new cases is corresponding to the number of new tests.\n3. The number of new tests slumps occasionally ( I've observed a pattern of weekend slumping).\n4. So, tests slump = cases slump = SPY moons\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Corollary:\n\n5) New tests revert to the mean after a slump, effectively bouncing back\n\n6) Following (2) from above, daily new cases rise on a relative basis\n\n7) SPY bleeds, because tests rally = cases rally = SPY diggs\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBulls should play 1-4, bears play 5-7. Specifically, that means\n\nBULL ACTION-- Load up on longs when the number of new tests shoots substantially above the mean because a drop in new tests/cases is likely 1-2 days ahead. Since weekends are days with lower new tests, Friday at 3pm works (assuming no bombshell news is reported over the weekend).\n\nBEAR ACTION-- Short the market when the news tests drops, like right now, on Monday 4/6\n\n&#x200B;\n\nData source:[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/e/2PACX-1vRwAqp96T9sYYq2-i7Tj0pvTf6XVHjDSMIKBdZHXiCGGdNC0ypEU9NbngS8mxea55JuCFuua1MUeOj5/pubhtml#](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/e/2PACX-1vRwAqp96T9sYYq2-i7Tj0pvTf6XVHjDSMIKBdZHXiCGGdNC0ypEU9NbngS8mxea55JuCFuua1MUeOj5/pubhtml#)", "created_utc": 1586231581.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fwdiy9/insight_into_the_covid_data_that_nobody_is/", "is_self": true}
