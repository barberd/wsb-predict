We had carnivals this weekend and new cases appeared in literally all the 3 biggest cities of the country (Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao). Just think about what could happen in the next couple months.\n\nImagine a weekend. We already get frustrated and the only thing we do is jerk off.

Gonna have to unclench my asshole so I can keep eating tendies when all this shit ends.\n\n\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b", "created_utc": 1582795816, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fa9m8x/spain_infected_turning_gay/", "is_self": true}
