Incubation period of up to 27 days with viral load strongest 3-5 days after infection (ie, can be highly contagious before showing symptoms).  R0 2.2 on the low end and possibly as high as 6.6 (ie, we're fucked).\n2. More than 20% of cases are \"severe\" requiring a hospital.  But considering point 1, after spreading through a community undetected for weeks and then suddenly revealing itself once hundreds or even thousands are already sick will quickly overwhelm the 50 (on a good day in the middle of flu season) open hospital beds in your city which means that 20% severe become a de facto CFR of 20% \n3. There is no vaccine coming; don't be an idiot.  SARS and MERS have been \"top priority\" for vaccine research for nearly a decade.  And it won't \"go away in summer like the flu\".  If this shit can handle summer in Singapore its gonna laugh at northern summers; this will be active and present for years.\n4. Japan health officials confirming yesterday that you can get this shit more than once.  GILD is only a treatment (for when you're on deaths door) and will not prevent you from getting it; or getting it again.\n5. If China taught us anything with their draconian quarantine measures (and fucking martial law to enforce said measures) it's that you can't contain this; who knows if domestic flights will even be open for non essential travel once this shit hits peak.\n\n**tdlr:** Nobody will be making travel plans soon and Expedia is fucked.  Companies are already cancelling work travel and families are already cancelling existing vacations. EXPE Q1 earnings (4/30) will be desperate and Q2  (7/23) will be downright hilarious.  EXPE is going to zero; ride those puts to glory just make sure you don't get caught by the rescue buyout in Q3 ;) \n\nAlong that same vein, TMCS is fucked too.", "created_utc": 1582836739, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/faiq53/expe_is_going_to_0_dd_on_twitter/", "is_self": true}
