However, I believe that we might be staring straight into the face of a major sellout so I doubled down on gold explorers.\n\nThe funny thing is that I'm doing all of this with TD Ameritrade commission-free ETFs, so I have to hold all of these assets for at least a full month before selling unless I wanna get hit with a juicy 16$ fee.\n\nDid I do the right thing or am I straight up retarded?", "created_utc": 1569947690, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dbvyf5/incoming_bear_party_this_week_or_what/", "is_self": true}
