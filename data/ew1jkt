{"id": "ew1jkt", "title": "Volatility Buildup In Chinese Market", "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nHere's a series post about making some serious cash. \n\n***What's Happening?***\n\nThe Wu-flu epidemic is far from cresting. The Chinese markets are closed and will be closed through Monday. The reason the markets are closed for this extended period of time is to avoid market volatility and prevent the Chinese market from crashing.\n\nWhat is happening is the opposite, at least where volatility is concerned. It is building up and will pop when and if the markets open this coming Monday.\n\nI am encouraging everyone to get in on this. Even if it's a small pop, it will be a pop. If it's a big one, then we clean up and everyone has a good day except the artistic inverters.\n\n***What's The Play?***\n\nBuy puts on FXI. That's the play. Play it how you like it. I'm already in and waiting to hopefully make some nice tendies come Monday. I would consider buying them a little bit out in the case that the Market gets an even further delayed opening.\n\nCredit to u/Leaky_Buns for the play. He's been saying it all over the sub for the past few days and I think he is correct.\n\n***Where's The Proof?***\n\n*Taiwan and Hong Kong Markets Take a Hit*\n\nThe Taiwanese and Hong Kong markets both opened this week to about -6% and -3% respectively after their return from the lunar holidays.\n\nThey are both continuing to drop. They are heavily reliant on the Chinese economy and should be a good indicator of what will happen once Chinese markets open. \n\n*Increased Infection Rate*\n\nThere's also the fact that the rate of infection is not slowing. Look at this graph from Johns Hopkins University and you'll see the number of reported infections has been increasing exponentially and will likely continue to do so.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/OMMZHON\n\n*Businesses Staying Closed*\n\n&gt; Hubei authorities announced late Wednesday that businesses are **not to resume work till midnight on Feb. 13.**\n\n&gt; This week, Shanghai, Beijing, Chongqing, Anhui, Fujian, Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang announced that businesses are **not to resume work till midnight on Feb. 9.**\n\nExcerpt taken from the CNBC Live Updates page linked below.\n\n*Viral Infection Not Contained*\n\n&gt; \"But the disease has spread far and wide inside China and, with extensive worldwide travel by its citizens, especially during the celebration of the Lunar New Year\"\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/health/china-coronavirus-outbreak.html\n\n*Months Until Vaccination Trials Begin*\n\n&gt; Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the N.I.H., who oversees Dr. Graham\u2019s team, said he expected the vaccine research to move quickly.\n\n&gt; \u201cIf we don\u2019t run into any unforeseen obstacles, we\u2019ll be able to get a Phase 1 trial going within the next three months, which will be record speed,\u201d he said, referring to early human trials that test for safety.\n\n&gt; With each new outbreak, scientists typically have to start from scratch. After the SARS outbreak in 2003, it took researchers about 20 months from the release of the viral genome to get a vaccine ready for human trials. By the time an epidemic caused by the Zika virus occurred in 2015, researchers had brought the timeline down to six months. Now, they hope the joint efforts will cut that time in half.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/health/coronavirus-vaccine.html\n\nThe virus is not under control.\n\n***Interactive Virus Map from Johns Hopkins University***\n\nThis is a handy tool to use to track the viral data on a cool interactive map. It is sometimes a few hours behind, but you can get a near perfect sense of the aggregated medical data available.\n\nCredit to u/hello-world-foo-bar for posting on the sub a few days ago.\n\nhttps://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\n\n***CNBC Coronavirus Live Updates - Bejing Time***\n\nCheck here for live updates from CNBC in Beijing time.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/30/coronavirus-live-updates-china-says-death-toll-rises.html\n\nLet's make it rain boys! \n\nBig sloppy tendie-scented kisses, LiquidityMan\n\n**TL;DR - Buy FXI puts**", "created_utc": 1580368288, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ew1jkt/volatility_buildup_in_chinese_market/", "is_self": true}
