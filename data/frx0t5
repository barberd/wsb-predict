I am genuinely, **full heartedly convinced** that this is actually the bottom. This market is so rigged.\n\nIf anything, by purchasing calls I am doing all you flamboyant bears a huge favor. You should thank me for this sacrifice. The more bears we convert, the greater sacrifice and higher likelihood they come out with a profit.\n\nI am doing this for the **greater good** because my puts are only down 50%, while some of you are down 80%+. It only makes sense that I should be the one to make the sacrifice.\n\nKDP 4/17 $26c, FIT 8/21 $8c\n\nEDIT: listen here, tards. buy calls, be bullish, MOON MOON MOON, *reeeeeeeeeeeee*.
