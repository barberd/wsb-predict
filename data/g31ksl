One day it will all implode and we\u2019ll be all fucked but rest assured it\u2019s not on this one.\n\nSo how do we profit from this? We make the most retarded bet possible - An electric car manufacturer reaching ATH after ER in the worst quarter in the history of the stock market amidst a world pandemic where everyone is scared shitless meanwhile oil is at multiple years lows. \n\nWe\u2019ll confuse the shit out of those HF bots by buying far otm calls where all they\u2019ll see is big bets on this retarded investment thesis.\n\nPS - I\u2019m in TSLA 1150C 4/24 because even more retarded is for TLSA to reach ATH before ER.\nPS2 - Either that or I can\u2019t read a fucking date so take that as you wish", "created_utc": 1587128544.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g31ksl/tsla_to_1200_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
