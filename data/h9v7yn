Blue line is the US daily COVID case count (depicted as 7-day average to minimize fluctuations). Yellow line is the daily case count (7-day avg) in the US minus five states that had the strongest first wave in March/April: NY, NJ, MA, PA, IL.\n\nNow since yall are a buncha retards, I'll make it simple for you: COVID is still spreading fast and bigly in the US excluding those five states... even faster over the last 3-4 days which I presume is due to the recent riots.. It's only a matter of time before we are at 30k+ cases/day, and some restrictions are put back in place. Last Thursday was just a taste of what's to come. A lot of red dildo days are ahead of us.\n\nPosition: spy 230p 9/19\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f9qxe0xqs6551.png?width=684&format=png&auto=webp&s=16baa9367a0e5dcc90cb289d30edaf272cc90b7e", "created_utc": 1592276585.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h9v7yn/proof_that_covid_is_going_to_the_moon_buy_putz/", "is_self": true}
