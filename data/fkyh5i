State Prices and Global Thermonuclear War: Or why the market didn't crash until recently**\n\nWe invest because we believe the future will be different than the present. We believe that some things will be more (or less) valuable in the future than they are today. Our job as investors is, to the best of our ability 1) determine what all the possible futures look like 2) how likely each of them is 3) how valuable the asset of interest is in each possible future and 4) how we should personally discount for the relative risk of each particular asset and each particular future, and for the time value of money (money in the future is worth less to us than money in our pockets right now).\n\nFUCK!!!!!! No wonder we'd rather just P&D Tesla!!!!\n\nNow hold up boys and girls there's something deep hidden in this model. Let's call each possible future world a **state** and assume just one period of time between the present and the future. We're here in the present state, and there are a number of different future states at some indeterminate time later (doesn't matter for this discussion). Here's the rule: **no multiverses!** When \"the future\" arrives, we are in only one particular state out of all the possible states. (Now of course states could share characteristics, but two states that were identical = one state, and one state that exactly shares the characteristics of two other future states A and B is, for this discussion, its own individual state C.)\n\nGot it?\n\nLet's say there are 3 future states of the world 10 years from now:\n\n1. 30% chance: Super-awesome economic, technological and cultural blossoming!!!! Stocks go WAY up, bonds do nothing.\n2. 50% chance: Malaise where technological growth stops, low economic growth, increasing healthcare costs as people get older (eek! sound familiar?). Stocks go slightly down, bonds go up somewhat but hey we get to clip our coupons each month.\n3. 20% chance: Global thermonuclear war.\n\nIn each of these three states, assets have different projected values. The value TODAY of each asset is directly related to both the chances of each of the 3 future states occurring and the projected values of the assets in each of those states, averaged over all possible states by all investors. This is a **model of reality** that is designed to **communicate some important truths**. For you fellow finance nerds or lapsed ones like me, you will know where I'm going with this, but **state** **pricing** lies at the heart of the Nobel Prize winning Black-Scholes options pricing formula.\n\nThink of the three possible future states above as spots where investors also allocate their money **today.** Remember, there are only three states of the world\u2014you've got no other choice. For each state, you'll decide how much of your total wealth you want to allocate, and in what particular assets.\n\nFor instance\u2014if you believe (1) is more likely, you will be biased to putting more money in stocks today. If you think (2) is going to happen FOR SURE, and you are a huge risk taker, maybe you'll put all of your money in bonds and none in stocks.\n\nWhat about state (3)? There's a 1% chance of global thermonuclear war. Will you be alive? Will the government be around? Will markets even exist? Will you even be able to collect on your investment?\n\nFrom [*The Optimistic Thought Experiment*](https://www.hoover.org/research/optimistic-thought-experiment) by Peter Thiel (2008):\n\n>More generally, apocalyptic thinking appears to have no place in the world of money. For if the doomsday predictions are fulfilled and the world does come to an end, then all the money in the world \u2014 even if it be in the form of gold coins or pieces of silver, stored in a locked chest in the most remote corner of the planet \u2014 would prove of no value, because there would be nothing left to buy or sell. Apocalyptic investors will miss great opportunities if there is no apocalypse, but ultimately they will end up with nothing when the apocalypse arrives. Heads or tails, they lose.In a narrow sense, it seems rational for investors to remain encamped at the altar of the efficient market \u2014 and just tend their own small gardens without wondering about the health of the world. A mutual fund manager might not benefit from reflecting about the danger of thermonuclear war, since in that future world there would be no mutual funds and no mutual fund managers left. Because it is not profitable to think about one \u2019s death, it is more useful to act as though one will live forever.\n\n**Conclusion: There are states of the world which are effectively NOT INVESTABLE AT ALL.**\n\nOK Joshua. Now let's say Russia, China, and USA announce initiation of arms control measures, and they are effective! Everyone follows. Instead of 30,000 warheads, 10 countries end up with 3 each. We develop Pooranium-236, an engineered bacteria that converts all fissible uranium into the smoothest, sexiest compost that ever existed. So no more additional nukes ever. AMAZING! Great news!\n\nBut what happens to state (3)? If the risk of a civilization destroying global thermonuclear war goes to zero, but in its place we've got a 10% chance of non-extinction nuclear war where 50 medium yield nukes are dropped. Which would be really really bad, but (let's say) not likely to destroy the world or take the economy offline forever...what then?\n\nThe number of **investable states just went from 2 to 3, and one of them is super bad**. In fact, in this state, you just want to be all-in gold, crypto, and farmland. So your portfolio of stocks and bonds would be at most 0, and more likely a short.\n\n**CRITICAL INSIGHT**: **The world just got better, the chance of civilization's sure death went from 20% to 0%, but the markets dumped on the news**.\n\nIf you substitute the coronavirus for (3), let's think about one of the various scenarios that could describe what happened from the time the virus was discovered:\n\n* (3) = 1% chance of some global pandemic pre Wuhan. Gonna be bad, so let's go short. We don't know what it looks like, don't know how governments will respond, never happened in globalized world before, etc. etc. It is an unknown unknown, but I'm informed enough and want to be prepared unlike all those ETF index fund sheep. It is an investable state, and the allocation of total investable dollars will be net short.\n* Wuhan happens. OK it's here. OK fuck it's really bad (=oh there is a big chance it's going to be super bad), I am a trader/investor so I am sophisticated, understand exponential growth, and know this could upend society, and myself and my entire family could die. (3) = 10% and is now much more likely to skew **non-investable because it's a total catastrophe and I'm dead.**\n* Funds devoted to a future state that goes from investable to non-investable **must go somewhere, and they have to go to the other 2 investable states!** Now we are in a complex \"3-body problem\". It will depend on the relative prices of assets and their expected values in the remaining two states\u2014but in the aggregate, there is now more money devoted to both\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n* \\*\\*CRITICAL INSIGHT: If allocation to stocks are already net long in the two remaining states (\\*\\*or say bonds too expensive relative to go up much more) **then extinction-level bad news, if priced in early, does not necessarily push markets down, and may even push them up.**\n* Corollary: if an intermediate outcome pops up because let's say China has seemed to get the virus under control **then** just like in the nuclear war example, a **virus related state becomes investable again**, and you'll want to be net short in that state. Then markets dump.\n\n*As an exercise, consider an alternative scenario based on where we are right now, under the assumption that seems to be common that \"we will get through this, but it will be tough\". What happens if the virus mutates, and it turns out that nope there now is a really big chance we're all gonna be wiped out?*\n\n**II. State prices**\n\nBack to a revision of our original model that doesn't include non-investable states for simplicity. There are three states of the world:\n\n1. 30% chance: Super-awesome economic, technological and cultural blossoming!!!! Stocks go WAY up, bonds do nothing.\n2. 50% chance: Malaise where technological growth stops, low economic growth, increasing healthcare costs as people get older (eek! sound familiar?). Stocks go slightly down, bonds go up somewhat but hey we get to clip our coupons each month.\n3. 20% chance: Coronavirus that's pretty bad but it is recoverable.\n\nIn finance, we assume the presence of a completely risk free asset (US gov't bond). A bond will pay $1 in each of those three states, no matter what (since you know you'll get your money back for sure). Whatever a bond that pays $1 at \"the future\" time currently costs is how we derive \"time value of money\" or the risk-free interest rate. For all you linear algebra nerds, think of the payoff vector of a bond in our model as \\[1,1,1\\] representing the three states of the world.\n\nNow let's consider the other two other assets in this world. A stock, and (here we go!) ORANGE JUICE. In each state, a stock has a different expected return, because it will be more or less valuable depending on how the future ends up. Same goes for OJ. Let's say a stock trading at $1 today is worth $2 in state (1), $0.80 in (2) and $0.40 in state (3). Now this is very important. Normally if you have 3 future states of the world, each with some chance of occurring and a projected value of an asset in that state, you just take the expected value (including a discount for time, and for the fact that you're taking some risk) and you get a price.\n\n**Here we are doing something different**. We are taking the prices of the 3 assets **today,** and under the no-arbitrage condition (\"there's no free lunch\" = you can't make more money than the risk free rate by taking no risk) **trying to find a price we would pay TODAY for $1 in each future state alone.** This is called the **state price.** A decent introduction with the math involved can be found in any finance book (for a real first-principles based textbook by a very clear and well-respected professor, I highly recommend \"Investment Science\" by Luenberger) or [the first part of these lecture notes](http://www.cambridge.org/ve/download_file/789332/).\n\nWe won't go through the math involved, but the point to remember is that if you add up the state prices of each state (represented by the payoff vectors \\[1 0 0\\], \\[0 1 0\\], \\[0 0 1\\]), you get the price of the bond because you are guaranteed to have $1 in the future. And, to restate the last paragraph, if you add up the state price \\* the payoff of each asset in each state, summed over all the states, you **get the current price of the asset.**\n\nSo let's take the state prices as given and think about what happens when \"things change\".\n\nLet's say the state prices we have derived are:\n\n1. $0.20\n2. $0.60\n3. $0.10\n\n(Remember, it has to add up to the price of a bond, which will be less than $1 if the bond pays $1 guaranteed in the future).\n\nWhat happens to the state price of (3) when the chance of it occurring goes from 20% to 90% **and it is still investable**. Remember, all you are trying to figure out is how much you would pay for $1 in that state, today.\n\n**It has to go up**, and the state prices of the other two states have to go down, **because they MUST sum to the price of the bond.**\n\n\\*\\*(\\*\\*Why does it have to go up? Think about it in the limit. Let's say it goes to 99%. There is a 99% chance state (3) will occur. How much do you pay for $1 in that state if it is a near certainty? A lot more than you would if the state had a 20% chance of occurring\u2014no matter what that state looks like, **as long as it is investible.** In fact, you might even pay ABOVE $1 in certain cases, because depending on the alternatives, you think you can pick up assets on the cheap and so $1 in that state is lots more valuable on a relative basis than in other states.)\n\nAnd since the price of any asset must equal the state prices x the value of the payoff in each state, the asset prices must change, in ways that depend on their relative values **and** (**CRITICAL INSIGHT)** **how their payoffs in each state were impacted** by the same change in the world that changed the chance of state (3) being the real future.\n\n**III. The hedge: \"20 Questions\" for discussion**\n\n1. When people walk into the grocery store and are sick, or they are scared about getting sick and want to build up their immunity, which fruits and vegetables become, **on the margin,** more likely to catch their eye?\n2. How often (when was the last time?) and how frequently do you personally buy frozen orange juice in a can or the OJ (from concentrate) in a bottle/carton? What about the rest of the country? What implications does that have given your answer to Q1 for baseline demand in states (1) and (2) vs state (3).\n3. How attractive is concentrate vs fresh in times of supply chain disruption?\n4. How much of the total retail cost of OJ would you estimate the raw concentrate represents? What does that imply about the relationship between the price change at the producer level and the price change at consumer level and its effect on consumer demand?\n5. What sort of juices do they serve in hospitals and what is the relative distribution between fresh and concentrate? When someone is in the hospital for 2 weeks, how does their juice consumption change vs if they were at home for 2 weeks?\n6. What percent of the FCOJ supply is grown in Brazil? How does that geographic concentration compare to other tradable commodities? What is your assessment of the US-Brazil shipping supply chain in all (3) of the states?\n7. Where does one take delivery of a purchase made via futures contract? What does that imply if supply cannot suddenly reach those locations?\n8. What sort of functions characterize the parameters and scenarios above (in a \"hand-wavey\") and the relationships between them. E.g.: Is Brazilian transportation cost/breakdown a linear function of the different states? Of the price? A linear function between the changes in state (3) probability? What does the demand curve for FROZEN OJ look like in relation to the availability of fresh citrus or fresh squeezed juice? Etc.\n9. Does citrus have other beneficial compounds besides Vitamin C that may affect immunity? How many people know this right now, and how might that change?\n10. If the same thing that increases the CHANCE of (3) occurring (which also increases the state price) ALSO increases the projected value of OJ in that state INDEPENDENTLY, what implications does this have for the current price of OJ given the above discussion?\n11. What classes of functions might characterize price given your answer to Q8 and Q10? How does that compare to the types of functions that characterize price in states (1) and (2)? Why?\n12. If the functions that characterize price dynamics are different in each state, how would realized price charts look under those different classes of functions? What about the technicals and current volatility when state probabilities and payoffs change in response to new information?\n13. What is the definition of a \"hedge\" in light of the state price model and your answers to the questions above? What makes one hedge more attractive relative to another hedge? Does it matter if they need be explicitly hedging the exact same realized outcome, in the exact same way?\n14. Describe the FCOJ futures market and compare it in terms of size, volume, gross value, players. What implications does this have for marginal demand on the supply side and on the demand side? From producers, bottlers, speculators, and market makers?\n15. Define \"volatility regime\" and \"phase change\" in your own words, as it might relate to the discussion above and your answers to the questions above?\n16. What does the chart of FCOJ futures prices look like? What do you expect it to look like given the discussion above? Given your answers to Q8, Q10-11, Q15?\n17. What does the implied volatility of the options on OJ futures look like given your answer to Q16? \"Compared to what?\"\n18. How much activity/discussion is there of OJ futures online?\n19. Restate the argument being attempted in this post in your own words. How confident are you in the validity of this argument? How frequently have you seen posts like this show up on [r/wsb](https://www.reddit.com/r/wsb/)? What might my motivation be?\n20. If all of the above is true, and the implications are extremely positive for the price of FCOJ, then why hasn't the price of FCOJ futures yet reflected that? What about the futures options?", "created_utc": 1584570117.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkyh5i/coronahedge_1_state_prices_nuclear_war_and_frozen/", "is_self": true}
