Happy Disney+ Day!\n\nDisney popped an ***incredible*** ***1.22%*** at the time of writing this, and it's trading at a **bargain** of **\\~138.41** right now (a **bargain** considering this is the next NFLX and it's gonna be $500 or even **$10,000 per share by 2020**).\n\nBut I noticed there's some... resistance, like in Disney's Star Wars.\n\nIt hasn't been able to break 140, and it's not trading at 150 like the hedge fund managers on Yahoo! Finance told me it would be trading at today, which is pretty surprising considering today was the launch day for something no one saw coming.\n\nSo I started to wonder... was Disney+ priced in?\n\nAnd then I did my DD. \n\nMy Disney Duediligence.\n\nAnd I zoomed out of my Google chart from \"5 Days\" to \"YTD\"\n\n...and I nearly died.\n\nDisney traded at this price nearly **7 months ago**.\n\nSo I started to analyze the company, starting with the Disney princesses.\n\nDisney... princess?\n\nd i s n e y p r i n c e s s\n\nRearrange the letters...\n\np r i c e d  i n... yesss'n?\n\n**It's fucking priced in.** It's always been priced in.\n\nBut I'm posting this before the trading day ends so you can inverse me.\n\n11/13 $150 calls, hurry!", "created_utc": 1573591505, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dvg1fl/disney_permanently_priced_in/", "is_self": true}
