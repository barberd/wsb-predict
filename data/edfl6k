You know how they say if you give a monkey a typewriter it would eventually Shakespeare? I\u2019m that monkey, but instead of a typewriter, it\u2019s Robinhood, and instead of writing Shakespeare, I\u2019m lookin to gain some tendies, even though there\u2019s probably zero chances of that happening with the retarded deal I just made. \n\nTSLA is going through the roof, we all know this. So I\u2019m pretty sure I just bought a call saying it will hit $475 by December 27. Do I know that\u2019s what I bought for a fact? Hell no, but it cost 14 dollars so fuck it, right?\n\nWhen purchasing I got that cute lil message saying \u201cnobody in the market iss stupid enough to buy this option\u201d, (it was worded nicer not to trigger my autism).\n\nSo could someone explain to me what the hell I just bought?
