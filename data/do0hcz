I think we are going to have a rally in global stocks that will be led by Chinese stocks.  Gold will probably stagnate because of capital outflows out of safe havens such as treasuries and other sovereign bonds.  I don't think gold will just collapse though.  Shorting gold is not recommended, but being long gold while risk assets are rising is a wasted opportunity.  Isn't freaky that stock markets can bottom in October and make everyone extremely bearish?  Look at the beginning of October when the markets gapped down bigtime and rallied back.  It's almost the same as October 1998 and October 2011.", "created_utc": 1572216816, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/do0hcz/market_message_from_stockchartscom/", "is_self": true}
