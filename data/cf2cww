Well steady hands and I held through earnings. Well here\u2019s my question, I have an exam tomorrow that will be taking place during market open. I\u2019m trying to determine what these are currently valued at. Before close 138 (2.07) and 138 (1.66). As we all know it shot to 140+ AH. Can anyone help me out here? Should I just place a market order to sell at the open, sell stop, sell limit? \n\nMany thanks in advance, guys. Best of luck on learning and getting those portfolio gains.", "created_utc": 1563506400, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cf2cww/msft_tendies/", "is_self": true}
