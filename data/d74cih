Now I am usually happy about these wins regardless of missing out, however, I tend to double it all up on some stupid ass retarded bullshit FD WHICH ENDS UP WINNING, and I don\u2019t close because the profit wasn\u2019t a big hit like before. \n\nWhy is that $100, $200 never good enough? \n\nMy goal is to make at least $100/day (which is far less than I have been consistently getting). What can I do to stick to my winning strategy and not fuck around with all of the earnings? \nEvery time my account goes from $3k to $400, I end up making a damn good play with Open the following day, bringing me back up to size. \n\nDo I aim for that win, then shut myself out of the trading world for the rest of the day?  \nDo I withdraw all of the earnings and keep my account under $500?  \n\nI feel if I cut myself out of the trading world during the day, I wouldn\u2019t be as knowledgeable of how specific stocks are performing and know their proper ranges, etc. which I feel is what guides me to the wins.  \n\nI\u2019ll probably end up deleting this, but posting here may help solidify the need to take action.\n\n\n\nA recent example: I purchased 75x MSFT 9/20 $142c last week, watched them deteriorate to .04 each, tried to sell them 3 times above market at close and then said fuck it I\u2019ll hold. Then MSFT does the buy back, I collect just over $4k.  \nWhile the stock was still moving I purchased 100 MSFT 9/20 $144c @ .12 with the intention of just collecting $200. Watched it climb up to .18 ($600) and then held on and watched them expire today.
