The difficult issue I have in this strategy is sorting out those that are hedges vs speculations or digging through to find the directional weight of the straddle/strangle. \n\nWhat\u2019s your scanning strategy?\n\nAlso, any thoughts thoughts on how to identify my problem areas?", "created_utc": 1587770723.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7j1a8/options_scanning_my_strategy_inside/", "is_self": true}
