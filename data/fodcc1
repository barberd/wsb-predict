You can\u2019t create films on your laptop from home. The new movie from them bombed which eats directly into their bottom line. Their cruise line has come to a halt. And the only thing they are generating revenue on is their online streaming and their online store. \n\nWhen the public can be public again, how many of those people are going to go running to Disney? There will be a fear of large social interactions for at least a year into the fall because parents don\u2019t want to risk the lives of their kids at fuggin Disney world.
