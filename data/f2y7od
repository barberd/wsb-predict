Messaging is severely under-monetized", "selftext": " \n\nTo me, when Facebook talks about turning Messenger, and Whatsapp into a \"Privacy Focused Social Network\" I hear 2 things:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) We're going to develop a lot of features. Features that expand room for ad inventory, make the apps more valuable to people, and increase lock in to make it more complicated to \"just switch\" to another messaging platform.\n\n2) Once that's done, we'll finally be ready to make money from the 2 billion users on Whatsapp, and 1.5 Billion users on Messenger. (They've had these two platforms drastically under-monetized)\n\nThey've thrown a lot around about payments, and commerce (which is also a big opportunity)...but my thoughts are mainly on ads.\n\nSnapchat is an example of a privacy focused social network, with a \"stories\" feature. In 2019 Snap had a $8.29 average revenue per user. Let's say, (that despite Facebook having the superior ad-platform, better ad-targeting, etc) Facebook monetizes Snapchat-like features at a $2.00 ARPU, and doesn't develop any further features. Let's also assume that half of the people that use Messenger also have Whatsapp accounts, so 2.6 billion unique monetized users on their messaging apps.\n\n**That's almost 21 billion in revenue, or 29.5% of current FB revenues.** That said I'd expect a slow roll out, as Facebook prioritizes user experience over monetizing. Zuck did say that they will begin rolling out \"some features\" over the next 6 months, but it's a long term project.. I'd guess the vision will be complete within 5 years though.", "created_utc": 1581541984, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f2y7od/my_shower_thoughts_on_facebook_turning_messenger/", "is_self": true}
