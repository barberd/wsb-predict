You think you're smarter than 99% of all the other schmucks that have tried to short $TSLA and got their teeth kicked in. Ok champ let's give it a shot.  \n\nTSLA is in the middle of a massive parabolic short squeeze. Strongest we've seen in a while, but we've seen moves like this before.  \n\n$TSLA is 108% above its 200 day moving average. Seems like a lot, but we saw over 150% during the run in 2013. If we were to see 150% above the 200 day, that would put $TSLA at 700.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e78j4kzh8dc41.jpg?width=1777&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef73114d3708bba5ffe07982151a8878b06a5c0e\n\nProblem with shorting here, is that you have earnings up on deck in about a week. That means puts are \"expensive\" (calls are too). So here's one way to play it.\n\nSell to Open $TSLA 31Jan20 475 Put \n\nBuy to Open $TSLA 21Feb20 475 Put \n\nCurrently going for 5.70\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wqq6sr7p8dc41.png?width=1607&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3b0d638b44873328c35cecf32d19c5740d0af1d\n\nYou're basically selling the options that have earnings, and buying options further out in time. If TSLA goes to 1,000 then you're out premium paid. If TSLA goes sub 470 you start getting bullish\n\n470 coincides with the rising 20 day moving average. The stock was there on Jan 8th.\n\nWhat this does is it allows you to finance the cost of owning the Feb 470 put. Into the end of the month you \\*should\\* be able to close the 31Jan put for cheap-ish. Then you've got a downside lotto ticket.\n\nThe 31Jan20 470 put has an IV of around 78%, so there is the risk of your back month premium getting crushed. That doesn't seem as likely because of the actual vol in $TSLA, premiums should hold up well post earnings.\n\n**Disclaimer: you'll probably get your teeth kicked in on any short play because we're still on the frontside of the parabolic run.** \n\n**But if you want to be a degenerate gambler and try to fade a parabolic stock through earnings, this is one of the least-bad ways to trade it.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCredit: [@stevenplace](https://twitter.com/stevenplace)", "created_utc": 1579714954, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/esfdjh/the_least_dumbass_way_to_short_tsla/", "is_self": true}
