After the upcoming failure of my 1/17 TSM calls my account will be at just around $900. I will be using this money for a final yolo: all in on TSM 4/17 $65 calls. \n\nWhy you ask? Because April 17th is my birthday. I've learned that TSM is a great company, but they're not a \"moon on earnings\" company. After yesterday's ER I expect to see a very slow melt upwards towards ~$70 - will it make it by April? I don't know, but I do know that stocks only go up.\n\nMods if this works out I'd like the flair \"Birthday Boy\" and if it doesn't you can ban me :(", "created_utc": 1579247877, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/epxg5h/tsm_the_reckoning/", "is_self": true}
