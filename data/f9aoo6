{"id": "f9aoo6", "title": "Some DD on Arlo Technologies (ARLO)", "selftext": "Arlo Technologies (ARLO) just announced their latest earnings and they beat on revenue and EPS and guided higher for this year with some positive outlooks:  \n[Arlo Reports Fourth Quarter 2019 and Full Year 2019 Results](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/17788501-arlo-reports-fourth-quarter-2019-and-full-year-2019-results).\n  \nThey also noted that revenues from their subscription service is climbing and should continue tick upwards as the trail period ends on their new cameras (video doorbell, Arlo Ultra, Floodlight, etc.).\nThese products were recently introduced and are already coming in with top picks/reviews (some even rated it better than Nest\u2019s products). They also just integrated with HomeKit which is a big complaint of Nest products.  \n  \nThe big part that a lot of people missed on their conference call is that **they now have the same amount of cash on hand as their total market cap**. They also brought in over $100 million more in revenue in 2019 than their total market cap. This truly is an unloved stock.  \nWhile there isn't huge short interest (around 4%), this stock has been down for quite awhile and there isn't a ton of stock float (about 70 million). A smaller amount of stock float at it's low price can cause this to run-up pretty fast especially if calls are getting sold more and the sellers are buying shares to cover the calls they sold.  \n  \nLook for some lower IV call options (some have massive bid/ask spreads) and hold while this stock continues to rise and you\u2019ll thank me later.", "created_utc": 1582639306, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9aoo6/some_dd_on_arlo_technologies_arlo/", "is_self": true}
