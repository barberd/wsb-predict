{"id": "g28q33", "title": "Why I think President Trump will be able to open the country based on his schedule.", "selftext": "Just some quick thoughts I wanted to bounce off fellow WSBers  \n\n\n* my political analysis is this, trump wants/needs to re-open the economy to ensure re-election\n* theres a sizable segment of population who want to get back to work and make money, including many businesses (donors to both repubs and dems)\n* red governors and red states are probably more keen at the moment\n* blue governors are playing cautious so if anything goes wrong they blame Trump but also they dont want to lose independents and purple republicans if they maintain this lockdown and kill their own prosperity\n* Blue Governors will be playing politics for max benefit, maybe secure extra federal funding and goodies to play along\n* if Cuomo wanna run for pres he cant go in as a governor of one of few locked down states and have New York become even poorer than West Virginia\n* mark my words, they will raise a stink about having to reopen (possibly early, but who really knows)\n* Governors and politicans will all want take credit for successful reopening , after all Congress is also up for election  in November.\n*  if shit goes south and there is a 2nd wave blame trump\n*  no lose situation for Washington and the States\n* max risk for trump but he has no choice\n* second wave probably land in late june if it happens and switch to puts\n\nAdditional point I just thought of: Trump doesn't care if a governor resists, his base will be satisfied he gave the order to open and it's not his fault the states are resisting.  \n\n\nWhat to buy?  In my opinion Abbott.  Trump always promotes their testing machines, and consensus is that we need more testing to ensure a safe reopening of the country.  Abbott has high throughput machines for mass RNA testing to confirm diagnosis, 15 minute rapid test for things like local clinics and hospitals and even corporations, and just announced a Antibody serology test which everyone is touting as a way to find out who can safely work.  They are current selling every testing supply they can produce and are working hard to ramp it up.\n\nABT C 15MAY20 90.00", "created_utc": 1587014327.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g28q33/why_i_think_president_trump_will_be_able_to_open/", "is_self": true}
