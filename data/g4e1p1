{"id": "g4e1p1", "title": "Real Reason For Why The PPP (Small Business Loan Program) Is Rigged.", "selftext": "This reason is very simple, and why places like Ruth's Steakhouse can get millions in loans.\n\nLet's take a big bank, for example, Bank Of America. They have millions of accounts, but only a limited amount of bankers to process the requests for these loans. How do these bankers get paid? Commission. \n\nWho gives them the most commission? The multi-million dollar \"small business\" loans that will for sure, 100%, be able to pay back the loan not the small mom and pop stores that make up America and stand for the American dream. \n\nThe definition of a small business is under 500 employees, you could be making 50 million a year, have no need for a loan, and still get approved a free forgivable loan from the government, while thousands of REAL small businesses get screwed.\n\nDon't trust people to do what is in each others best interest, trust them to do what's in their nature. Human nature is selfish, and greedy. \n\nEventually, this price will be paid and it won't be pretty.\n\nBanks and Bankers will be to blame again, but don't worry they will be the first to get bailed out.", "created_utc": 1587325547.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g4e1p1/real_reason_for_why_the_ppp_small_business_loan/", "is_self": true}
