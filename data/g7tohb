I get that DEAC is essentially = ~40mm shares converted 1:1 with DKNG class A but in addition the section adds:\n\n\u201c186,831,051 shares of New DraftKings Class A common stock are issued to the DK Equityholders applying a 0.3546 exchange ratio, and 393,954,594 shares of New DraftKings Class B common stock are issued to Jason Robins, 40,861,997 DraftKings Class A common stock are issued to the SBT Sellers, applying a 1,001.5 exchange ratio there will be an aggregate of 313,077,942 shares of New DraftKings Class A\u201d\n\nBloomberg shows 313mm as the equity float with a $6bn market cap, is that correct? It seems like there is a ton of dilution not being accounted for based on the current share price. From the articles I\u2019ve read about the merger announced in December, initial valuations were at $3.3bn, so not fully understanding the huge increase.\n\nAppreciate any input/thoughts!", "created_utc": 1587822051.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7tohb/can_anyone_explain_draftkings_beneficial/", "is_self": true}
