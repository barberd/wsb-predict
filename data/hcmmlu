{"id": "hcmmlu", "title": "Robyn Denholm - or why $TSLA doesn't give a damn about your opinion.", "selftext": "Doing some research on why the shareholders meeting might be pushed back and/or asking for Robyn to be voted out as Tesla chair she seems to be the lynchpin.\n\nShort DD - Elon is off the rails and she's his guide rails, but because no one will insure their board members (because of Elon), he's covering \"a policy\". A couple of people also think Elon is getting paid wayyy too much.\n\nMy opinion - she's been chair since Nov 2018 (when share price was ~350.00). $TSLA closed at $991.90 on Friday.\n\nTheir argument is she is supposed to protect the company from depending on the CEO to cover their board insurance/manage salaries.\n\nThis has to be THE dumbest vote ever.\n\nCan you imagine seeing the success and rise in share price and saying \"we don't like it\".Elon has a plan and he's executing on it. This train doesn't slow down, and FFS imagine when Boring, SpaceX, Neuralink, or Starlink IPO. Imagine opening prices at $250 a share with $250Bln valuations. You don't get there paying someone $10Mln a year either (his shares are worth $1.6Bln currently).\n\nHe's $20Bln away from hitting his next trache.\n\nIf anything Elon has unlocked a cheat code we'll see more and more CEOs turn to. Where your CEO is tied to stock price outside of paydays. More boards will do this and it'll become the standard. Glass Lewis and ISS can get fucked.\n\nDisclaimer: I own no shares in $TSLA this is just a discussion.", "created_utc": 1592661155.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hcmmlu/robyn_denholm_or_why_tsla_doesnt_give_a_damn/", "is_self": true}
