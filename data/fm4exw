I live in Orlando and go to Disney all the time, love it, spend way to much money there on all their festivals. Been investing around the market for the downturn and had some Disney puts I made money on along the way. Got out of Disney when I was only getting marginal tendies instead of the massive windfalls everyone else was getting.\n\nAs I look around at all the companies, trying to figure out a play that doesn't seem insane, like shorting a company that's already down 80%, I keep coming back to Disney. Even after today's 10% drop, Disney is only down 40%, it should be down 60% plus.\n\nPriced in is what we are all fighting. Right now I don't think Disney is priced in for parks being closed all summer. Disney is currently closed until April 1st and there is no way they are opening back up in 11 days as every day we are getting exponential increases in infections. Unless there is some vaccine coming, I believe this is going to be brutal.\n\nDisney Revenue Streams:\n\nCruises - See Carnival ($CCL) for how thats going. (down 76%)\n\nResorts - See Hilton ($HLT down 45%) Marriott($MAR down 50%)\n\nParks - See Seaworld/Busch Gardens ($SEAS down 70%) Six Flags ($SIX - down 75%)\n\nMovies / Disney + / Misc IP - Hard to directly compare because Netflix isnt in the same boat, but for the sake of argument lets just imagine not as hard hit, maybe even profitable.\n\nAt this point Disney has massive upkeep costs on the parks, cruise liners, and resort properties along with all the staff for each, while taking in zero income. Disney also wont be able to profit from any of these for the near foreseeable future and cant risk staff turnover so has to keep burning cash on employees.\n\nThen we have long term impact on Disney and what mass unemployment does to the country. Depending what aid package may or may not get passed, nobody will have the money to go to Disney. Everyone who lost everything in their 401k wont be taking any loans and will be in hoard mode.\n\nTLDR\n\nPuts on Disney until 5/1, strike of 65.
