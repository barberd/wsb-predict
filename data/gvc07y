You've just worked hard to finish page 8 of the coloring book your wife's boyfriend bought you for Christmas last year. You deserve a break. Before nap time, you open RH only to see a 4x gilded post circle-jerking over the 10-bagger earnings play they've been milking over the last week. You stare, blank faced at the post. Your brain faintly remembers the ticker from months ago when your friend told you the company would blow up during the beer virus. The rage builds even as the half-eaten crayon hanging out of the side of your mouth wets with drool. A single syllable _guhhhh_ releases from your mouth as you realize the tendies could have been yours if only your feeble brain had processed enough TLDRs to fool you into buying a call\n\n\n# If this sounds like you, I've built something to help you out next time you need someone to hold your hand while you confidently swipe up on some OTM weeklies\n\n**[/u/WSBStockTickerBot](https://www.reddit.com/user/WSBStockTickerBot) scans [/r/wsb](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/ \"WSB\")'s new posts and will notify you when DD is being posted about tickers you're interested in**\n\n## How to use\n**EASY>>** [CLICK HERE TO SUBSCRIBE TO ALL DD FOR A TICKER(S)!](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=WSBStockTickerBot&subject=Subcribe%20Me&message=You%27ll%20be%20subscribed%20to%20%24MSFT%20and%20%24AAPL%20as%20an%20example%0AType%20more%20tickers%20anywhere%20and%2For%20erase%20the%20line%20above%20if%20you%20don%27t%20want%20those) **<<EASY**\n\n**EASY>>** [CLICK HERE TO SUBSCRIBE TO ALL DD FOR ALL TICKERS!](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=WSBStockTickerBot&subject=Subcribe%20Me&message=ALL%20DD) **<<EASY**\n\nOr...\n\n* Send [/u/WSBStockTickerBot](https://www.reddit.com/user/WSBStockTickerBot) a message or comment on something it's posted (this this post) with a ticker or tickers. **Chat is not supported by Reddit for bots please make sure you send a DM or respond to a [/u/WSBStockTickerBot](https://www.reddit.com/user/WSBStockTickerBot) comment**\n  * Example: `$AAPL $UCO` will subscribe you to the `$AAPL` and `$UCO` tickers\n* Use a message with stop at the beginning to be unsubscribed from specific tickers\n  * Example: `STOP $AAPL`\n* Use `STOP ALL` to unsubscribe from the \"ALL DD\" feed\n\n## A couple things to know\n* If you subscribed to an individual ticker you'll be notified of new posts with the `DD` flair for that ticker\n* If you subscribed to the \"ALL DD\" feed, you'll be notified of all new `DD` flaired posts \n\n## Need some help\n* Currently, the bot can be rate-limited when making posts. If you can give the bot some orange arrows would help. I'd like to have the bot post on rising DD-flaired posts with the tickers it finds in them to help other people find and use it\n* If you find any issues or have a suggestion or feature you'd like to see, send a message to [/u/WSBTickerBotHandler](https://www.reddit.com/user/WSBTickerBotHandler) or open an issue/PR here https://github.com/WsbTickerBotHandler/WSB-Ticker-Bot\n* Stopping your \"ALL DD\" subscription will not stop individual tickers you've subscribed to separately\n\nEDIT: IF some of you subscribed to the ALL DD feed and received an error message saying your request couldn't be interpreted, I fixed the issue and you'll be subscribed.\n\nEDIT: Receiving a lot of subscriptions, the bot can only crunch through so many requests at a time. You should receive a confirmation within 15 minutes\n\nEDIT: This blew up a bit. Turns out it's hard to notify hundreds or thousands of people about each new DD post as soon as it's up. Keep subscribing, I'm working on making sure everyone gets notifications but it might take a bit.
