Easy fucking tendies!!\n\nCall to put volume ratio today was about 22. Upward pressure. \n\nBest part is though, there's some merger talk in the works... that's where the insane fucking tendies come in. Sell deep out of the money calls for a couple bucks, or just don't sell them at all. Fuck, at this point, you might just want to buy the fucking calls, catch the full force of this upward swing so you don't feel like a jackass when you're standing there with your $200 from the movement and $5 from selling shitty calls with your dick in your hand while the underlying equity is rushing past the 40's like a horny college student trying to fuck your mom and working his way into the 50's, oh god, he's getting into the 60's now, what the hell are we doing with a fucking closed position 30 points ago!!\n\nPoint is, if you sell the 34 covered calls buy the 35 for a dog shit price so you don't miss out on the real tendies.", "created_utc": 1571976842, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dms3s1/15_tendies_guaranteed_probably_more/", "is_self": true}
