I called yesterday that today would be one of the largest days ever of money leaving the markets and this action essentially proves I was right. The fucked thing here is that the FED will now be loading up its balance sheet with debt for companies that are no longer operating, and the government will be paying unemployment to its former staff all while the company is looking for massive bailouts... now they have to bail them out putting more good money after bad to protect their investment. \n\nIf things don\u2019t get vaccined up quick, shit is going to fucking implode on Government. The fed and gov are holding the bag on this one.", "created_utc": 1584979579.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fnmgk9/fed_actions_are_indicating_just_how_broken_the/", "is_self": true}
