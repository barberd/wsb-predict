{"id": "g2eioo", "title": "Another theory: Waiting for the drop to reveal itself, AKA the Anti-Burry approach", "selftext": "Another  viewpoint:  We (bears) are all expecting another big leg down, but we  can't seem to time it.  The Michael Burry \"I may be early, but I'm not  wrong\" approach is bleeding us (some faster than others).  So, how to  time it?\n\nMy theory is that the  tide is still moving upward, and I refuse to fight it.  Until the tide  turns downward, I'm not looking to short.  After the down trend is  confirmed, I still am not shorting.  I will wait for an overbought  situation during the downtrend, and THEN short.  Yeah, I won't get in at  the absolute top, but I don't care.  I just want to be on the train  going in the right direction, even if I do get on at a later stop.\n\nBig  picture - MMs had no liquidity on the first big drop, and were largely  unable to move things to their advantage.  Enter the printer, and now  they have liquidity.  Notice how the DIX moved right after JPow did his  thing?  The MMs have two primary objectives here: to get themselves from  gamma negative to gamma positve; and to squeeze the ever loving fuck  out of everyone, both long and short.  Ladies and gentlemen, they have  done both.  The max pain for Wednesday was 277, and for this Friday, 276.   Guess where we will end up this week?  After that mess, they will have  squeezed everything out, and be gamma positive.  There is then (at least  until the next monthlies come due on 5/15) a chance for things to react  as they should.\n\nI'm watching the  SPY D1 trend, and it shows signs of weakening, but has not yet turned  over.  It may not show a confirmed turnover until we hit 260ish, at  which point most of my gay bear friends will jump on board, which will  be EXACTLY the wrong time.  Piling on with dumb money at the end of a  move guarantees you will be whipsawed.  After we finally turn over on  the daily, I will be looking for an overbought situation on the H2 to  enter.\n\nWhat I think will happen:  down to 265ish, bounce to 275ish, down to 260ish, bounce to 266ish, down  to 245-247, bounce to 255ish, then the big one, maybe 235 or so.  Take  these numbers lightly, THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE.  My plan is to  short at the bounces, providing things are overbought (in a downtrend).   The market will tell us where those numbers are, we need to be  adaptable to the math.  My numbers may be waaaaay off, but the concept  is the same: wait for bearish confirmation, then short the overbought  bounces.\n\nThis strategy requires  PATIENCE.  This is not for the adrenaline junkie, this is a position  trade, meant to be held for weeks.  We need to have the discipline to  wait for the best entry point, FOMO be damned.\n\nIn  the meantime, I am day trading based on the M30 momentum, looking for  overbought or oversold opportunities on the M5. Calls Tuesday, + 7.2%,  puts Wednesday - .5%.  Same concept applied to smaller time frames.\n\nFeel  free to comment, please be nice.  If you disagree with me, that's fine,  just be civil and don't call each other names.  Let's all go make some  money!  (but be patient...)\n\nTL;DR - Wait for bearish confirmation on SPY D1 (MACD), then look for overbought on H2, (W%R) then short.  No positions currently, day trading same concept on M30/M5.  Happy now, you guys with the attention span of a gnat?", "created_utc": 1587042281.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2eioo/another_theory_waiting_for_the_drop_to_reveal/", "is_self": true}
