Good afternoon and happy Saturday to all of you on this subreddit. I hope everyone made out pretty nicely in the market last week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead! :)\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 25th, 2019.\n\n# **Dow drops more than 450 points, S&amp;P 500 posts worst day since January amid global growth worries  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/22/stock-market-wall-street-in-focus-as-growth-concerns-persist.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks tumbled on Friday as global growth fears and the Federal Reserve's more cautious economic forecast sparked investor angst into the weekend.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank to its session lows heading into the close and finished down 460.19 points at 25,502.32. Bank stocks led the decline thanks to a sharp pullback in long-term Treasury yields. The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.9 percent to 2,800.71, its biggest one-day drop since Jan. 3. The Nasdaq Composite declined 2.5 percent to 7,642.67 as shares of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Alphabet and Apple all closed lower.\n*****\n&gt; \"There's a host of worries out there and those worries continue to mount,\" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities. \"The fear of recession is increasing.\"\n*****\n&gt; \"As a result, we have a market that is rethinking some of the optimism that was priced in.\"\n*****\n&gt; Sending bank stocks lower was an inversion of the so-called yield curve. The spread between the 3-month Treasury bill yield and the 10-year note rate turned negative for the first time since 2007, thus inverting the curve. An inverted yield curve occurs when short-term rates surpass their longer-term counterparts, putting a damper bank lending profits. An inverted curve is also considered a recession indicator.\n*****\n&gt; Citigroup fell more than 4 percent. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank of America all declined at least 2.9 percent.\n*****\n&gt; Friday's moves come after Fed surprised investors by adopting a sharp dovish stance on Wednesday, projecting no further interest rate hikes this year and ending its balance sheet roll-off. Though investors often dislike higher borrowing costs and rate hikes, the motivation for the central bank's restraint rekindled worries of a GDP growth slowdown. The Fed justified its more temperate outlook by cutting its U.S. economic growth outlook for 2019.\n*****\n&gt; \"Maybe one should think about the global economy and not pin everything on the Fed,\" Jeffrey Gundlach, CEO of Doubleline Capital, told CNBC's Scott Wapner. \"Except the Fed should operate in consideration of global conditions too.\"\n*****\n&gt; Friday saw more weak economic data from around the world that stoked those fears.\n*****\n&gt; IHS Markit said manufacturing activity in Germany dropped to its lowest level in more than six years in March. In France, manufacturing and services slowed down to their lowest levels in three months and two months, respectively. For the euro zone as a whole, manufacturing fell to its lowest level since April 2013. These data sent the German 10-year bund yield briefly into negative territory, its lowest level since 2016.\n*****\n&gt; \"The indicators are stacking up to suggest that this is not a 2021 phenomenon, that we could actually see the possibility of a recession starting maybe later this year,\" Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, told CNBC's \"Closing Bell.\"\n*****\n&gt; Nike also weighed on the market throughout Friday's session. The athletic apparel company's stock fell 6.6 percent on the back of weak quarterly sales growth in North America. Boeing shares dropped 2.8 percent after Indonesian airline Garuda canceled a $6 billion order for 49 Boeing 737 Max jets.\n*****\n&gt; Despite the decline on Friday, stocks were still up sharply for the year. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are up 11.7 percent and 15.2 percent, respectively. The Dow, meanwhile, has rallied 9.2 percent.\n*****\n&gt; \"Let's not lose sight of the fact that we've had a nice rally over the last couple of weeks,\" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. \"Today is not a great day, but after a strong week or two you tend to get a bit of a sell-off.\"\n*****\n&gt; \"Now, should you be cautious? Absolutely, because the slowdown worldwide is something people need to be cautious about.\"\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/T4YLFyJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/XJzqF0N.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/idNVc1V.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/PVyE2Pn.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q7yuITr.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/EjtkGE5.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bkYI0Ax.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/j9FKS2U.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AfXOr7N.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/aAfcanW.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/Q4ufdYK.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/mHFDero.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Watch Out For End of March/Q1 Weakness\n\n&gt; March markets have been rather turbulent in recent years with weakness historically later in the month, taking some mean end-of-quarter hits as fund managers often partake in quarterly window dressing and portfolio restructuring. After the big gains we logged in January and February choppy market action is not surprising, especially with the backdrop of the ongoing China trade and Brexit deal delays and what appears to be the end of the Fed tightening cycle for now. Boeing\u2019s woes and U.S. political infighting have not helped either.\n\n&gt; But as you can see in the chart of the recent history of typical March trading patterns with 2019 performance overlaid in dotted lines, action so far this month has not been all that unusual. With that in mind we are ever leery of another end-of-March hit.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0b1f074cf798ba5aaa823db11c688c8b/tumblr_inline_poonqi2PvV1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# April Almanac: DJIA\u2019s Best Month\n\n&gt; April marks the end of our \u201cBest Six Months\u201d for DJIA and the S&amp;P 500. On April 1st, we will begin looking for our seasonal MACD sell signal and corresponding early signs of seasonal weakness. Even in historically strong pre-election years the \u201cWorst Six Months\u201d have been lackluster on average. \n\n&gt; April 1999 was the first month to gain 1000 DJIA points. However, from 2000 to 2005, \u201cTax\u201d month was hit, declining in four of six years. Since 2006, April has been up thirteen years in a row with an average gain of 2.3% to reclaim its position as the best DJIA month since 1950. April is third best for S&amp;P and fourth best for NASDAQ (since 1971).\n\n&gt; The first half of April used to outperform the second half, but since 1994 that has no longer been the case. The effect of April 15 Tax Deadline appears to be diminished with numerous bullish days present on either side of the day. Traders and investors are clearly focused on first quarter earnings and guidance during April. Exceptional Q1 earnings and positive surprises tend to be anticipated with stocks and the market moving up in advance of the announcements and consolidating or correcting afterwards.\n\n&gt; Typical pre-election year strength does bolster April\u2019s performance since 1950. April is DJIA\u2019s best month in pre-election years (+4.0%), second best for S&amp;P 500 (+3.5%) and third best for NASDAQ (+3.5%). Small caps measured by the Russell 2000 also perform well with gains (+2.8%) in seven of ten pre-election year April\u2019s since 1979.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d1d20027899e760b8265b907733e5b3b/tumblr_inline_poqkokIT8B1spdppr_400.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Russell Falls Apart\n\n&gt; While the rest of the market was rallying and holding up, the Russell has been struggling for close to a month now. After peaking above its 50-DMA back on 2/25, the Russell has had a hard time holding onto any gains lately. Earlier this week it made a lower high when the rest of the market was making higher highs, and to close out the week, it declined 3.6% for its worst day of 2019, making a lower low. Not a pretty chart at all.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/032219-Ruh-Roh.png))**\n\n&gt; The Russell\u2019s underperformance can really be seen in the ratio of the Nasdaq to the Russell 2000. This week, the ratio between the two really become unglued, topping 5 for the first time since February 2001.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/032219-Ratio-20-years.png))**\n\n&gt; On a longer-term basis, the only time the Nasdaq has been outperforming the Russell 2000 by such a wide margin was during the period from November 1998 through February 2001. And if you think the ratio is extreme now, during that period it got as high as 8.64 on March 28, 2000. In order for the ratio to get to that sort of extreme now, the Nasdaq would need to top 13,000 (assuming the Russell remained at the same level).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/032219-Ratio-20-years.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Yield Curve, Yield Curve, Yield Curve\n\n&gt; If you are anything else besides the yield curve today, the market doesn\u2019t care. After inverting for the first time since 2007 earlier today, the spread between the yields on the 10-year and 3-month US Treasuries has sucked up all the oxygen in the room as investors, traders, and their algos fret over the ominous economic signal that an inverted yield curve historically implies. Who cares whether the onset of a recession usually comes several months or even a couple of years after the curve first inverts; investors are using this as an excuse to take profits, and take profits is what they\u2019re doing.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/032219-YCa.png))**\n\n&gt; Just to illustrate how captivating the yield curve has been to the equity market, check out an intraday chart of S&amp;P 500 futures versus the yield curve since very early this morning. Moves in the yield curve are clearly leading equities. When the curve started flattening early this morning, equities started heading south with the pace of selling accelerating when the curve inverted. Then, as the curve made its intraday low right after noon, the low in equities followed less than 40 minutes later. It\u2019s like the school playground, where the yield curve is the \u2018cool kid\u2019 and equities are the followers.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/032219-YC-SP-500.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Stocks Feeling Sensitive\n\n&gt; Investors are wondering what the right number is for the market as stocks leg lower on bad global data to close the week. Without taking a view on what the \u201cright\u201d price for the S&amp;P 500 is, below we show a way to organize thinking about valuation in the short-term. In the table below we show a range of EPS growth rates relative to 2018 and a range of multiples on the resulting EPS numbers. The result is where the S&amp;P 500 should trade given hypothetical earnings and how those are valued. For example, if you estimate EPS will fall 2% in both 2019 and 2020, and you value those EPS at a multiple of 15.0x, the S&amp;P 500 is almost 700 points above where it should be! Alternatively, if you think EPS will be stable but should be valued at a relatively aggressive 19.0x, the S&amp;P 500 should be trading near 3100. In the grid below, we\u2019ve highlighted ~2800 values (roughly where the S&amp;P 500 sits right now) to show the implicit EPS growth and multiple assumptions embedded in the price. Again, we don\u2019t know the \u201cright\u201d combination of multiples and EPS growth, but if you\u2019re extremely beared up with the Friday drop or think stocks are set to surge thanks to a dovish Fed, this analysis can help you see what sort of assumptions would need to play out for that to happen.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/032219-Sensitivity2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Fed on Reserve\n\n&gt; The Federal Reserve (Fed) has doubled down on its patient stance. Policymakers signaled a complete pause in policy at the conclusion of the Fed\u2019s March meeting, with a nod to a slowing pace of growth and global uncertainty.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Fed voting members projected (via the latest \u201cdot plot\u201d) unchanged to slightly lower interest rates this year, with one more rate hike in 2020 or later to lift the long-term rate to 2.75%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DOT-Plot-Aligns-with-a-Federal-Reserve-U-Turn.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Policymakers also lowered their gross domestic product growth projections to 2.1% for 2019 and 1.9% for 2020, while Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged that global weakness could be a notable headwind to the U.S. economy.\n\n&gt; Still, Powell conveyed significant faith in U.S. economic fundamentals, noting in his press conference that \u201cit\u2019s a great time to be patient,\u201d as the labor market remains strong, confidence has improved back to encouraging levels, and the outlook remains positive.\n\n&gt; \u201cPowell and the Fed delivered a balanced message to U.S. investors, indicating that the lack of clarity warrants a patient stance,\u201d said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cWe side with the Fed here in thinking that underlying economic conditions remain solid, with evidence of a slowdown at the beginning of this year from near-term temporary headwinds.\u201d\n\n&gt; Powell hinted that interest rates are in the \u201cbroad range\u201d of neutral, or the point where policy is neither accommodative nor restrictive to output. That doesn\u2019t mean that rates have hit a short-term ceiling, though. We wouldn\u2019t be surprised if stabilizing U.S. growth and higher inflation lead to a rate hike in the second half of 2019. The Fed\u2019s current projections give few indications of that happening, likely because of policymakers\u2019 hesitance to pass judgment on the U.S. economy amid mixed signals from data. Because of this, we expect the Fed to carefully communicate any change in stance to investors.\n\n&gt; The Fed also announced it would start reducing the pace of its balance-sheet runoff in May, and end the runoff entirely in September. Powell reiterated that interest rate changes are the Fed\u2019s primary policy tool, but a larger balance sheet could help buoy risk assets and capital investments.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for March 22nd, 2019** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqNabw-V4Mc))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 3.24.19 - Yield Curve Inversion, Germany, Mueller Report** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNO25tigOaI))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$CRON** \n&gt; * **$NBEV** \n&gt; * **$LULU** \n&gt; * **$BB** \n&gt; * **$FIVE** \n&gt; * **$WGO** \n&gt; * **$RH** \n&gt; * **$RHT** \n&gt; * **$AEYE** \n&gt; * **$PAYX** \n&gt; * **$YRD** \n&gt; * **$CCL** \n&gt; * **$ICLK** \n&gt; * **$MDWD** \n&gt; * **$KMX** \n&gt; * **$ARCO** \n&gt; * **$ACN** \n&gt; * **$INFO** \n&gt; * **$LEN** \n&gt; * **$ORN** \n&gt; * **$HOME** \n&gt; * **$OLLI** \n&gt; * **$MKC** \n&gt; * **$AKAO** \n&gt; * **$SCVL** \n&gt; * **$SNX** \n&gt; * **$TITN** \n&gt; * **$FDS** \n&gt; * **$CONN** \n&gt; * **$NEOG** \n&gt; * **$SGH** \n&gt; * **$ONTX** \n&gt; * **$HYRE** \n&gt; * **$SCWX** \n&gt; * **$PVH** \n&gt; * **$EVLV** \n&gt; * **$LIFE** \n&gt; * **$SNES** \n&gt; * **$BOXL** \n&gt; * **$UNF** \n&gt; * **$EAST**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/AfXOr7N.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/i8snno3.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/sZrTWAU.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.25.19 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZeIoFGE.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.25.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cz7AZYP.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.26.19 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cprDRID.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.26.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8eD2rmu.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.27.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Qepi43B.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.27.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3CAi10L.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.28.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/bTFq8fj.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.28.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/chPbSdl.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.29.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qpstXGb.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.29.19 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Cronos Group Inc. $19.23 \n&gt; **Cronos Group Inc.
