It starts with determining where I stand versus the crowd and then helps me pick strikes. I use some examples within the post in SNAP, less bullish than the crowd, more bullish YOLO, and \"the bulls and bears are both nuts\" and where to set strikes in calls, spreads, and even figuring out the realistic risk in buying stock for a quick move. Excerpt here, more below..\n\nTL;DR  \nThe expected move is to options trades what the point spread is to a football bet. You wouldn't place a bet on a football game blind, without knowing who was favored and by how much.\n\n  \nDeeper  \nExpected move (or implied move) is what the options market is pricing as the consensus potential move of a stock, in either direction, over a period of time. It is derived directly from options pricing and is a practical expression of implied volatility.\n\nIf implied volatility increases (based on net buying demand for calls and puts) the expected move increases. If implied volatility decreases (based on net selling of calls and puts) the expected move decreases.\n\nThe expected move is direct, and actionable expression of uncertainty. If a stock is about to report earnings, or about to announce trial results of a new drug, there is increased uncertainty of how the stock will react. Once that event passes, the expected move decreases, reflecting expectations of more certainty.\n\n  \nHow to use this\n\nAside from the immediate insight of actually seeing when options are pricing big moves, how else can I use the expected move? The expected move is the point at which at the money straddles breakeven. In other words, it is the line at which options are either overpriced, or underpriced, just like the point spread in a football game. If you are buying options and looking for a move higher, you need it to not just move higher, but a certain magnitude higher. Just as if you bet even money on the Ravens as favorites to beat the Steelers, you need the Ravens to win by a certain amount, not just win.\n\nThe expected move should be incorporated into all new trades (including stock) to assess risk/reward and specifically in options trades, to help with strike selection.\n\nThe entire post here including examples in SNAP and charts: [https://www.optionseye.com/eye-on-education-expected-moves-for/](https://www.optionseye.com/eye-on-education-expected-moves-for/)", "created_utc": 1590766626.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gsv6qk/making_trades_less_dumb_calls_spreads_even_stock/", "is_self": true}
