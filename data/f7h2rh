The stock only has to go up 11 cents to break even for $12 2/28.\n\nCEO Larry Culp is a genius.\n\nLastly, and most important, stonks go up Monday through Wednesday, and go down Thursday and Friday. So obviously GE is going way up start of next week. \n\n$12 2/28 and 3/6 calls, literally can't go tits up.", "created_utc": 1582316768, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7h2rh/ge_calls_in_the_next_2_weeks/", "is_self": true}
