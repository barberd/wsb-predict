{"id": "gq4e0l", "title": "Taxes and SPY vs SPX, IWM vs RUT, QQQ vs NDX. PLEASE STOP WASTING MONEY", "selftext": "OK LISTEN UP, YOU ARE ALL DOING IT WRONG.\n\nI feel sad when I see how excited you are about your option gains on SPY, knowing that you made a great trade, but did it with the wrong instrument, and are **paying a bunch of taxes you don't need to pay**. **If only you had used SPX or XSP, you'd owe something like 5-7% less tax**\n\nThe reason is that index options (SPX/XSP, NDX, RUT, etc), commodity and stock index futures, and futures options of those are all section 1256 contracts:\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/section-1256-contract.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/section-1256-contract.asp)\n\nWhy does this matter? **IT MATTERS BECAUSE YOU PAY LESS TAXES ON SECTION 1256 CONTRACTS!**\n\nA gain or loss on a 1256 contract is taxed at 60% long-term capital gains, and 40% short-term capital gains, whether or not you hold it a day or a second or 5 years. I know that almost none of you hold your positions more than a month, so this basically means you get to be introduced to this thing called 'long term capital gains'.\n\nHere's an example - Suppose for a moment you make $75k a year, so your tax rates are pretty average. You get your stimulus check and after spending $200 on booze, you promptly put $1k into spy calls for the end of this week, or 10 contracts at $1. They print and you make $10k in profits. Congratulations, you are an options investing genius!\n\nIf you do this with 10x SPY calls, you then pay a federal tax rate of 22%. If you do this with 1x SPX (or 10x XSP, which is the mini version) call though, you pay 40% STCG (22% rate) and 60% LTCG rate (15%). This gives you a blended rate of 17.8%. In other words:\n\nWith SPY, you owe $2200 in tax to the federal government.\n\nWith SPX or XSP, you only owe $1780 in tax. So, by doing SPX/XSP instead, you save $420 - which is a really special number to many of us. Also, a single contract of SPX is going to have cheaper commissions than 10 of SPY usually. You likely pay similar commission in 10xXSP as you do with 10xSPY.\n\nThe total after-tax % benefit is of course higher if you are in a place with state income tax - this just models a 0 tax state.\n\nIf you somehow LOSE money (seldom happens), you are generating long-term capital losses, which first apply against long-term gains. This can be bad if you had long term capital gains from something, but you can plan around this, so that it's infrequent and doesn't matter. Also, you can still apply long-term losses against short-term gains once you run out of long-term losses. And let's face it, most of you never generate long-term gains if you are on this sub and are trading SPY puts. The main place you'd be in danger with losses is if you were using these as hedges, and then wracked up long-term losses that go against future long-term gains. But, if you were generating a pile of short-term gains, it doesn't matter.\n\nA few other things to think about:\n\n1. Most futures options have more hours of access and are 22.75/5 generally, so if news happens, you can respond - though liquidity often sucks outside cash market hours. Index options vary on hours, but the S&amp;P ones overlap a lot of the pre-market and the first 15 minutes of the post market. \n2. Index options and futures options both are larger than the ETF equivalents - index options about 10x the size, and futures options on the primaries about 5x the size. Fortunately, SPX has a mini version that is the same size as SPY which is XSP. For the other indices, for those of you with RH accounts, this may be insurmountable, and you'd need to stick to XSP.\n3. The index options I mentioned next-day cash settle. This is nice sometimes, as you don't get end-of-day liquidated to avoid a physical settlement beyond your account margin, and prevents \"Robinhood ate my homework\" stories. Futures options generally settle to futures, so they have the same issue.\n4. If you file as a 'trader' on your taxes, which allows you to do things like deduct your college tuition to True Trading Group if you did that for some reason, you won't be able to use this benefit as all trades become just straight up income or loss against income.\n5. Be careful on liquidity. SPY liquidity is great. SPX is pretty good. NDX and Rut? Be careful. Es - so-so, nq - bad, rty - bad. You have to be patient and walk up the spread slowly, or take prices where someone is offering a good deal, if you play the ones with worse liquidity.\n6. These count as a 'realize' at the end of the year. Just an FYI. So, if you buy 5000 SPX calls now, and we are at 4500 at the end of the year, you'll owe a tax bill even if you don't sell them. This can be real bad if they then plummet January second, because you'll still owe the taxes, and won't be able to apply the new losses against those gains. You'll need to make some gain to get the tax money back. So, be careful with that.\n7. SPY dividends can make it annoying to trade on the days it pays out, while SPX has continual dividends from all companies backed in. This can help you avoid trading errors.\n8. The index and futures options have quarterly, monthly and weekly mwf versions. The quarterlies for the futures have weird settlement rules and blow up in the morning instead of close. Trade with caution. I don\u2019t recall the index products having the issue but you\u2019d want to check if it was expiring soon. \n9. Never buy these with market orders. It\u2019s dumb on any option but you will get absolutely destroyed on the less liquid versions of these. You must carefully use limit orders to buy, starting near the posted bid, after you confirm that bid isn\u2019t bogus. \n10. These tend to be European options - settlement are end only - not American options. As such they are implicitly worth a bit less because you can\u2019t exercise whenever. This will show up as them being seemingly a tiny bit cheaper. But it\u2019s fair pricing. This also means you don\u2019t get assigned on those that are European if short until they close. Which is nice! \n\n**Cheat sheet of useful indices:**\nNote - RH does not carry the index options presently. I have no idea why. They may carry the futures options products which are smaller increments than the full sized indices - waiting to hear from someone on RH. Will update when I do. \n\n10xSPY ---&gt; 1xSPX (index), 2xES (future).  [doublemctwist1260](https://www.reddit.com/user/doublemctwist1260/) adds that XSP is the same value as SPY but has 1256 status, so is a tax efficient alternative to SPY - 1 SPY = 1 XSP. NOTE - XSP is also an S&amp;P 500 etf on the Toronto stock exchange - you want XSP the index not the stock/etf. \n\n41xQQQ ---&gt; 1xNDX (index), 5xNQ (future)\n\n10xIWM ---&gt; 1xRUT (index), 2xRTY (future)\n\nThere are futures on VDEV and EEM, which are MXEA and MXEF respectively. Their option markets are bad, but the futures themselves have good liquidity during cash market hours. There are a ton of commodity futures and futures options, oil being the most noteworthy.  Gold has a variety of futures, but GC is pretty easy to access. I think that's on CBOE? And of course, VIX has all of these, though VIX options have large ticks and I hate them. But, VIX options do get this treatment, while some vol etf does not.\n\nHope this helps...
