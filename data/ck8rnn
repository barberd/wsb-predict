{"id": "ck8rnn", "title": "Tip: sometimes you can get an amazing fill by shooting high right at opening bell.", "selftext": "Ive seen the advice to wait 30 minutes before buying or selling options. From my experience though if you try to get a fill right at open you can sometimes get a bargain. I usually trade vertical spreads and will hold some through earnings. Today for example I put a sell limit order in for AMD at $15 for the 33.5 to 34 spread and for a brief second it spiked for a fill at $18. Its around $0.02 where it belongs now. This happens more often than you would think. On a winner you can sometimes get the full length of the spread even when it really isnt locked down yet. I havent started trying this yet for opening new positions but I imagine some insane bargains are there if you try. Just a tip for all of you degenerates out there, a lot can happen in those first 5 minutes but after that the opportunity is usually gone.", "created_utc": 1564581064, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ck8rnn/tip_sometimes_you_can_get_an_amazing_fill_by/", "is_self": true}
