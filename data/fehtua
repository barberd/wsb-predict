{"id": "fehtua", "title": "DD: Virgin Galactic Hiring commercial pilots for late Spring start", "selftext": "Not a monumental move, but definitely an indication of forward movement.\n\nGeorge Whitesides tweeted out a job application for two new pilots for Virgin Galactic with a neat little video. Looked at the JD, got some potentially juicy info/confirmation bias for y'all:  \n\n\n&gt;***Successful applicants will ideally start work in late spring/early summer 2020 and will be based at Spaceport America in New Mexico, working as part of the WhiteKnightTwo and SpaceShipTwo spaceflight system. Some work will also take place from time to time at Mojave, CA as well as at other locations.***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***After the start of commercial operations, the role will change from testing and developing the spaceflight system to regularly flying spaceflight missions, and supporting customer hospitality and training.***\n\nThat all said, looks like they're gearing up to ramp their test flight program, and presumably begin commercial operations shortly thereafter.\n\nAssuming the pilots are paid very well, and that they wouldn't be hiring more if there wasn't an anticipated need to scale up.\n\nShit looks like it's getting real boys. \n\n\\---\n\nTweet: [https://twitter.com/gtwhitesides/status/1235990963819962368](https://twitter.com/gtwhitesides/status/1235990963819962368)\n\nJob Description: [https://careers-virgingalactic.icims.com/jobs/5810/pilot/job?mobile=false&amp;width=1408&amp;height=500&amp;bga=true&amp;needsRedirect=false&amp;jan1offset=-480&amp;jun1offset=-420](https://careers-virgingalactic.icims.com/jobs/5810/pilot/job?mobile=false&amp;width=1408&amp;height=500&amp;bga=true&amp;needsRedirect=false&amp;jan1offset=-480&amp;jun1offset=-420)", "created_utc": 1583519499, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fehtua/dd_virgin_galactic_hiring_commercial_pilots_for/", "is_self": true}
