It's causing people to quarantine and has thus resulted in a significant drop in hotel, casino, airline, and restaurant stocks with expected increases in unemployment. \n\nUNH's main insurance biz makes money by taking money from people and hoping not to pay for them to go to hospitals. With an expected increase in rates of doctor visits, hospitalizations, and ICU admissions, UNH is going to be paying through the nose for their customers. Add in spike in unemployment, we're talking decreased revenues in the future.  \n\nSo spike in costs + decreased revenues = heavy drop in earnings\n\nThe other sectors are already at or near 5 year lows while this big boy is at 1 year low and $100 above 5 year lows. I only see it tanking here but tell me why I'm wrong cause I could be. \n\nTL;DR  UNH 04/17 $200 puts", "created_utc": 1584643018.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flf4d7/biggest_short_left_unh/", "is_self": true}
