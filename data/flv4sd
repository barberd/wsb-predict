If you are holding 3/20 expy anything as a put, my heart goes out to you.  \n\nIf you are holding a put past past today.... hang tight, clench your butthole, and don't, I REPEAT, DO NOT panic sell.  The market is tired, the market is depressed, the market is fatigued from all the red and negative.  The witching hour is upon us, and the market will run green very briefly.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBUT.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs more news comes out, as unemployment hits, and as more states issue shelter-in-place (California, e.g.) this bounce will reverse again.  Play the trends, look at some 30+ day out puts towards EOD depending on how meteoric this bounce is.  If your equity is already locked into longer puts, just hold tight and wait it out.  This is not forever, this is only today.  One last time... DON'T PANIC SELL.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGE $7p 3/27  GPRO $3p 3/27   F $5.5p 3/27   BAC $14p 4/3  GM  $17p 4/9", "created_utc": 1584711351.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flv4sd/hold_on_tight_folks/", "is_self": true}
