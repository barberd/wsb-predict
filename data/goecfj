{"id": "goecfj", "title": "Order DD : Revenge of the Triple Profit", "selftext": "Prelude :: WSB has been looking for a new profit for months, TA analysis keeps showing drop after drop but they never come. If u haven't noticed MM has already made first move...\n\nA couple weeks ago we had the first profit, a shrimp that managed to be wrong just as often as this sub at predicting market movement. This shrimp is just a shell game - MM has made their second move.\n\nThen we move onto the GECKO. Noticing a pattern? THe first time we became enthralled by VS posts we all learned about the gecko and how accurate his predictions were. Then the gecko correctly guessed the market 7 times in a row. NOtcing a pattern yet? VS was basically the first gecko and he correctly called some scary moves in the market. MM has made their 3rd move\n\nTHEIR 3RD move on the TRIPLE TOP!!!\n\nGecko is wrong and now the sub is ready to accept anything. In comes the greatest DD of all time, man's best friend. He calls the market right once, on a red day, when all of this sub is already paper handing left and right and looking for any excuse to dump their calls. At market close DOG once more provides DD and says that tomorrow will be RED. MM has made their 4D move (DD + DD)\n\nNow future's are read, China trade war is brewing, DOG has predicted down AND we have a 3x witching 3 day weekend. By all means tomorrow should be a down day right? We're going to open down something like 1.5% and it's going to look like a massive sell off right? Anyone who goes into tomorrow with 300C is going to sell them (Actually this is where this theory breaks down because we're gonna baghold those no matter what but someone's prolly gonna sell theirs).\n\nTomorrow will be the biggest green day we've had in weeks\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0k98ydghj9051.png?width=2386&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b0ebfdd5e410e6426a1cd25a58306bea7b7b10a", "created_utc": 1590130296.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/goecfj/order_dd_revenge_of_the_triple_profit/", "is_self": true}
