{"id": "fims86", "title": "DONT POKE THE BEAR ( Short Crude)", "selftext": "As much as we all love the equity market there is many tendies to be made in futures( or options on futures for the broke). This is setting up to be a pretty obvious trade to me that has paid and will keep paying. \n\nTLDR \n\nPut Ratio condor 3:4 May 20th crude futures , April 16th puts , B 24.5 S 26  S 31 B 33\n\nAs of writing trade returns $4900 on $1600 \n\nThe DD \n\nMarch 5th - The genius leader of opec decides to move forward without Russia\u2019s approval on production cuts . I would like to thank CNN for making me so up to date on the leader of Russia\u2019s personality quirks , but this was clearly a slap in the face and would no doubt piss Vlad off. Enter shorts. Complete collapse the next day when Russia , to everyone\u2019s surprise (wtf?) , doesn\u2019t play ball. The issue is exacerbated by MBS taking a similar stance with not giving a fuck if oil hits the floor. \n\nMarch 13- a week into the tension , no retest of the $27 bottom yet. The bullish momentum is not there. The call market is much thinner than the puts which holds more weight in the futures/ commodities markets since they are derivatives of derivatives. We end the day with our fearless leaders misguided efforts , including showing our poker hand with the \u201c fill the tanks\u201d line. \n\nHere\u2019s the catch. We can take all the storage tanks we have , multiply by 50 , and it wouldn\u2019t be a drop in the bucket to the Putin MBS combo. Add in the additional travel bans over the weekend  to reduce demand , and you have 2 reckless people acting on emotion who have been more or less disrespected from multiple fronts and now have trump openly taking about about how we plan to take advantage of them. \n\nI don\u2019t see them playing ball. They have the resources to take the crude price as low as they please and hold it there for some time before it gets to painful. And we all know how it goes with the allah Akbar mentality , they may have a shit eating grin with $10 barrels. Someone needs to win this fight and there is several powerful Chess moves left on the board to this losers game. \n\nThe TRADE\n\nGunna go full autist here , because I do see a floor given the nature of commodities it makes sense to me to cap the upside to lower cost. \n\n3:4 Ratio PUT condor \n\n/CLK0 ( May 20 Light crude futures)\n\nBuy to open 3 April 16 24.5 PUT \nSell to open 3 April 16 26 PUT\n\nSell to open 4 April 16 31 PUT\nBuy to open 4 April 16 33 PUT \n\nthis with be entered at a $1630 debit and will return $4900 on expiration if crude is above $26 and below $31. Many points to take considerable profit early at a very wide price range and entered with positive theta. Also your still at a point of profit at expiration all the way down to $20 a barrelI, risk is to the upside but at a debit. I have open contracts on both the April and May futures and will roll the April\u2019s to form the above position tomorrow at 5 pm.
