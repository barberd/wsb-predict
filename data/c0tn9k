Now I live in Toronto Canada and boi oh boi the hype is \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\n\nThe biggest winner are the two baddies of the Canadian telecom industry, Rogers ($RCI) and Bell ($BCE). Rogers media owns Sportsnet and Bell owns TSN which both have the rights to show the NBA Finals in Canada. Why is that important? Well, the first record set in Canada was Game 2. It had 4.3 million Canadians watching. Shit got real fast. By Game 5, the NBA finals were the most watched broadcast in Canadian history. 13.4 million people, roughly 1 in 3 Canadians watched Game 5. Together, 22 million out of 37 million Canadians, have at least watched the finals once\n\n\nNow let's the peak viewers for Rogers and Bell. Rogers's Sportsnet peak viewership was 6.4 million (about 1 in 6 Canadians we're watching the finals on Sportsnet) and it was during Game 5. Bell's TSN had a peak viewership of 7.7 million during Game 6 (about 1 in 5 Canadians). Remember those are peaks, there have always and millions of people watching at any time during Game 1-6.\n\nThese guys made alot of money with subscriptions and advertisements. Rogers' Q2 earnings release date is July 17, 2019. Bell's Q2 earnings release date is August 1, 2019. Calls on both.\n\n\nUber, ABinbev and Pizza Pizza have all benefit too", "created_utc": 1560574605, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c0tn9k/the_real_winners_of_the_nba_finals/", "is_self": true}
