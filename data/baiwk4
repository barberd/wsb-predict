{"id": "baiwk4", "title": "The high school ETF", "selftext": "I think I\u2019m gonna name it $HSCHOOL, here are the holdings below:\n\n$MO- If you didn\u2019t know, Altria recently acquired a minority stake in JUUL, which is the most popular Vape. You should see high school bathrooms, people only go in there to vape. \n\nAAPL- The IPhone, it\u2019s the standard phone for high school kids. Also, AirPods have become a big thing in high school. \n\nLULU and NKE- Lululemon, the most popular clothing for girls, and Nike, another very popular clothing brand for both guys and girls. Most clothing logos you will see in high school are one of these two. \n\nSNE and MSFT- This is purely for PS and Xbox, the two consoles that dominate the market. Every guy in high school has one or the other. \n\nNFLX- Another entertainment company. Every single kid has Netflix. \n\nFB and SNAP- No kid uses Facebook, but facebooks owns Instagram, which every single high school student has. Every high school  student uses Snapchat as well, in class, at home, everywhere. People think that Instagram is taking Snapchat\u2019s marketshare, but in reality, they both serve different purposes, and are used by every kid in high school. Btw.. Instagram now has way more ads than usual, an ad every 3 posts. Not saying 100% that they\u2019ll beat earnings next quarter, but watch FB on the 24th. \n\nBUD, TLRY, and CGC- Basically any weed/alcohol company. At parties and basically every weekend, many high school students smoke weed and drink beers. \n\nThat concludes the $HSCHOOL ETF. I\u2019m happy to hear any suggestions for stocks to add.
