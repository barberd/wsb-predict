Look, if we have access to it and think that we understand the severity and how serious everything could be then the powerful and wealthy had that information long before. \n\nNow I still think that the market is going to tank and we're going to enter a deep recession or depression, but it is my feeling that the rally we have been seeing will dramatically stop when everything reopens. This will be because markets can't price in how society will react to this issue and therefore need to wait until data is collected on our behavior which can only occur after people have started shopping again. At that point investors will be able to see where and how many people go to shop, and the number of workers needed for that demand, how their behavior and psychology has changed, and, therefore, where to invest. Only once markets open can demand be accurately reassessed. Right now all they can react to is Covid which is priced in, Oil, Printer go BRRRRRRR, and other government bailouts which are great for stocks. \n\nmarkets know that all of the unemployment and bad things that are being reported in the news are just because of all of the quarenteening and Covid-19, it won't be until after we reopen that the real bad news of the economy will hit and I believe it will hit hard. I hope that I'm wrong, I'm sure I will be roasted and proven so but if not: $SPY 200p 6/19", "created_utc": 1586796054.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0mjcv/markets_wont_tank_until_after_business_as_usual/", "is_self": true}
