Given the extraordinary number  of applications received recently, as well as the expectation that  claims will continue to increase over the coming weeks, the Legislature  should anticipate that the first week of benefit payments will take much  longer than 21 days. Similar delays occurred during the Great  Recession. On March\u00a024, the state Labor and Workforce Development Agency  [directed](https://www.labor.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/2020-03-20-JS-letter-to-SH-re-UI-_-final-signed.pdf)  EDD to begin immediately paying claims for UI benefits prior to making a  final eligibility determination. A similar directive was issued during  the Great Recession and helped to ease, but not eliminate, payment  delays. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCalifornia EDD's claim handling infrastructure is built with gum and paperclips and they know it. They could barely handle the existing number of claims they had *before* this shitstorm happened. The 90s-era systems are totally overwhelmed by the number of applicants.\n\nThis is just in CA. I'm sure most states are in similar situations.\n\nA lot of people applying for unemployment aren't going to see their money as soon as they'd hoped. People trying to survive on meager savings = consumer demand will collapse even harder than it already has. I expect to hear about a small wave of late mortgages / rents / car payments this month and then a fucking tsunami of delinquencies in May that won't ease up until state unemployment insurance finally starts catching up.\n\nTL:DR - huge chunks of the population are going to miss payments because most people have like $3 in savings, consumer demand will collapse and banks will get fucked by delinquencies.\n\nMy positions: GE $6p 6/19, GE $5p 9/18, UUP $30c 9/18", "created_utc": 1585852232.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ftroic/california_edd_expecting_significant_delays_to/", "is_self": true}
