{"id": "fs5oz4", "title": "Can you imagine being a bear?", "selftext": "Worst pandemic in a century.  Supply chains in a completely globalized world grinding to a halt.  Retail shut for 3-12 months.  10-20% unemployment is all but guaranteed.  Half the F500 has withdrawn or revised guidance.   Uncertainty whether a virus is the end of times, or will just decimate boomers.  Average AR aging has gone from 38 to 53 days (and climbing).  International shipments at less than one third capacity.   Manhattan is emptied in a way that you wouldn't believe if it was in a movie:  You can walk down 42nd street at noon on a weekday and see two people.  Subway at rush hour mostly empty.  We've had the greatest run on guns and ammo and non-perishable food in the history of the United States  (before most of the gun shops were forcibly closed for quarantine).  Medical supplies will almost certainly run out, leaving salvageable people drowning in their own breath and dying preventable deaths due to those shortages (as has happened in Wuhan, Italy, Spain and Iran).   The airlines have and will continue to shutter.  High level government officials, C-suite executives and others of high rank are dying.  People aren't allowed to gather in groups of more than 2.\n\nNow imagine being a bear.  All that is true... but you're still down.\n\nEven if you bought back your shorts or sold your puts at the very bottom, you're only even for the past 6-12 months.  You're still down every other day for the past 10 years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI respect you guys.  I like money too much to bear.", "created_utc": 1585625968.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fs5oz4/can_you_imagine_being_a_bear/", "is_self": true}
