{"id": "gssm6a", "title": "Opportunities in Formula One (NASDAQ:FWONK)", "selftext": "Fomrula One is a company that sells the rights to broadcast and held the F1 motor races. 2019 was a hot year for the stock (+43%) since the new owners (Liberty Media, CEO Chase Carey) have managed to grow the global audience and populatity of the sport thanks to a lot of social media marketing and engagement.\n\nThe 2020 recession came and the stock plummeted to -55% from its ATH beacuse thanks to the beer virus the races cannot be held. It recovered more than half the dip since the general stock market rally and since they are planning to start the F1 season in July.\n\nHowever today it could drop significantly since today a coulple of news stories have dropped:\n\n* Reanult (EPA:RNO) has announced massive layoffs and that could have implications since they are in a lot of debt,  they could look to let go their F1 team they own based in Enstone\n* Williams (ETR:WGF1) has announced huge losses for 2019 and is looking to sell the F1 team or raise capital, otherwise they won't survive\n* McLaren has also announced layoffs recently\n* There is uncertainty over the long term commitment of Mercedes in the sport\n\nThese fact could result in the stock dropping massively today, and I think it's a very good opportunity to buy since imo these issues will be solved and the teams will be bought if they don't make it. And the teams will have life easier anyway in the coming years (starting from 2021) thanks to the implementation of cost cutting mesures in the sport as a whole. In addition, new sporting regulations should result in better racing and keep the interest for the sport very high, as it has already catched a very good momentum. So with iron hands, this stock held for the next 5 years could be a banger, or even in the medium term.\n\nOnly negative I can see is that the August earnings will probably be very bad and generaly they are in a lot of debt right now (DEBt to EBITDA right now: 88.6 GUH ... but the median is mostly like 11). Price/book is only 1.46 though ... What do you think? Short term bear, long term bull?", "created_utc": 1590757356.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gssm6a/opportunities_in_formula_one_nasdaqfwonk/", "is_self": true}
