Trump has already showed he is trigger happy with the shit that went down in Iran earlier this year. Potential WW3 remember? Trump ejaculates every night knowing he has nuclear launch codes and the strongest military might on the planet. What I'm getting at is he doesn't only want to be known to make a big booming economy. He wants go down as a fucking WAR HERO. Second term Trump full scale invasion in China absolute world war 3. No one is going to vote alzheimer Biden don't worry its already locked in. All trump needed was a catalyst and this Covid-19 gives him that. I'd imagine him trying to instate some type of restitution China has to pay to all American Citizens or something along those lines. Of course China will tell him to fuck off, but Trump will continue to press. Guarantee first shot will be from Trump after that absolute war. Depending on the time table invest in all potential war profiteers. \n\n* $ATK - Ammo \n* $BA - (buy calls now imo) noway trump will let $BA fall they are number 2 in defense contracts they will be producing war planes and stealth bombers and other aerial stuff)\n* $GD - Tanks\n* $LLL - Sonar and shit\n* $LMT - More aerial shit\n* $NOC - Aerial shit\n* $NOC - Bombs for the planes\n* $UTX - Attack Choppers\n* $BAX - Bio Chemical Warfare \n* $VXGN - Vaccines just incase we bio chem bomb our own peeps\n* $BLK - Blackwater - mercenary group extremely dangerous but good buy\n\nOne potential security to look at during this time is $TSLA.
