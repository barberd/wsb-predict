{"id": "h95r8c", "title": "6/14/2020 Weekly Wrap-up and What to Expect", "selftext": "This past week the S&P 500 experienced its biggest daily drop in nearly two months - what happened? A combination of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's pessimistic view of the economy and worry around a second COVID wave / lockdown put significant pressure on the markets. Are these concerns valid? Here are the details:\n\n1. **On Wednesday, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell laid out a prolonged picture of economic recovery after COVID.** While Powell stated interest rates will remain near zero and promised continued financial support, he projected a lengthy economic recovery. Powell expects average unemployment of \\~10% during the last three months of the year vs. unemployment of 13.3% today. Furthermore, he expects GDP to contract by 5 - 10% this year. These estimates mean the expected monthly decreases in unemployment rates will be less than the 1.3% decrease we saw in May and unemployment to decrease at a slower rate while reopening ramps up.\n2. **As states reopen, 21 states saw an increase in average daily new cases.**[ ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-economy-worst-of-coronavirus-shutdowns-may-be-over-11590408000)21 states saw an increase in COVID cases as they have begun reopening. Furthermore, hospitalizations have begun to rise in at least 9 states. However, COVID death are still declining steadily. We'll need to keep a close eye on whether the nation is able to continue this steady decline in COVID deaths following this recent increase in case counts. Continued decrease in COVID deaths will mean we are handling the new cases earlier and better.\n3. **Economic recovery continues steadily with unemployment claims reports decreasing and consumer price index (CPI) improving.** This week, we saw signs of economic recovery as unemployment claims reports decreased by 335K, from 1.8M to 1.5M. Furthermore, CPI decreased by only 0.1% in May compared to 0.8% in April; if we look over the past 12 months, the CPI actually increased by 0.1%. Both indicators suggest the slowing of the economic contraction due to COVID. Furthermore, the CPI improvement indicates the Fed's current policy is working; generally, CPI decreases dramatically during recessions as consumers curtail their spending.\n\n**WX Capital is maintaining its position in the market.** Powell's pessimistic economic sentiment and the rise in COVID cases are unfortunate, but not alarming. Looking ahead, we will be keeping a close eye on unemployment rates and COVID death rates, and gauging the market's reaction. As of now, May's increase in employment and the general trend in decreasing COVID deaths are promising signs of economic recovery.
