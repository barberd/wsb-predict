I've seen some ridiculuous trades that made me wonder if there was any thought to it at all. What I've found is that most of you have some sort of reason for each position,  as convoluted as it may be. Some of you post your yolo positions with DD, but it's lost in the midst of shitposts. Do any of you actually document your positions to reflect on later?\n\nI used to document my trades in a notebook along with related metadata (current events, social sentiment, exit point,  DD, etc) and found that it helps me open less irrational positions.  I've since built an app that allows me to do this and was wondering if anyone else would benefit from this.  \n\nIf there's enough interest,  I'd be open to making it public,  and perhaps throwing in functionality to share positions and DD with others.  I'd love to see an RSS feed filled with real-time trades, each backed by their own half-baked rational. I'm envisioning the love child of r/wsb + StockTwits + RH.
