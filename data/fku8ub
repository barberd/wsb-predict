{"id": "fku8ub", "title": "Puts on WWE", "selftext": "WWE has only fallen 30% in the last month.  While that is already pretty significant, consider that it has been already on a downward trend for a whole year.  On top of that, Wrestlemania will be run without a live crowd.  Now on top of that fact that they will lose out on all sales from tickets, who is going to want to watch this without a live crowd?  Part of what makes this popular is the atmosphere and it will be the lamest atmosphere ever.  If you look at other companies with live events they have been hit harder than WWE even though they have been in an upwards trend.   WWE should not be above $30, and when people see the poor ratings from Wrestlemania the stock is bound to tank.  This is still a great opportunity for puts in a market where it is increasingly challenging to find a good deal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR:  WWE 35p 4/17", "created_utc": 1584555407.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fku8ub/puts_on_wwe/", "is_self": true}
