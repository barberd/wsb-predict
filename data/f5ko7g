{"id": "f5ko7g", "title": "Do you like signing contracts with a pen? No? Then look at $DOCU", "selftext": "Don't you hate it when you have to print 30 pages of a contract for your clients and then have to ask them to sign and initial all over it with a pen that runs out of ink, then you gotta scan all of those 30 pages and store it back in your company database? Oh you want to amend it because someone forgot something? Gotta repeat all of the above steps, with no tracking or anything. DocuSign literally solves all of that, it literally can't go tits up. If it went tits up all of your workplaces would return to the dark ages of manual contract management. I see no reason to not look into some 2/21 YOLOs (please hide from theta gang by thurs) or some safe March calls. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDD: My company uses it natively for agreements, if yours has any salt it probably does too.
