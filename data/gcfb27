Lyft has nothing. It's literally ridesharing.  \n  \n-Q1 2019 earnings were 739.87M, Q4 2019 was 984.25M. Estimate for Q1 2020? 905.73M LMAO.   \n  \n-This POS was at $15.54 in March, now its back up to $29.48??   \n  \n-They literally have no path to profitability.  \n  \n-Earnings on 5/6. They're gonna miss so fucking hard its a joke.   \n  \n-I honestly don't think it's priced in cause if it was this shit would be trading sub $10. Q2 will be even worse.  \n  \n-TLDR; LYFT 25P 5/15", "created_utc": 1588458553.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gcfb27/goodnight_lyft/", "is_self": true}
