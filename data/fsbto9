{"id": "fsbto9", "title": "The Ballad of Big Dick Vick: Onions, Futures, and the American Dream", "selftext": "Hello, idiots\n\nIt's me, Fuzzy. Today, we're taking a short break from your regularly scheduled educational programming to talk about futures contracts, the very first meme stock, and, more importantly, the **original** autist icon. No, it's not about u/jartek putting up [the big black monolith for you to hoot at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9woRJ7-mD7Y) in 2012. We're turning back the clock for some storytime about why you can trade futures on just about anything in America - other than onions (or receipts on box office returns, but that's a whole other fucking story).  Don't worry, you screeching nerds in the back; I'll explain what futures are along the way.\n\n\"Why should I give a shit, Fuzzy?\". Because (i) a little history of markets is good to have in your back pocket (ii) you probably don't know what a futures contract is, so this might do you some good and (iii) we're all fucking bored in quarantine and it's not like either of us have anything better to do. You really think I'd be doing this shit if Opening Day wasn't cancelled and half my clients weren't going fucking tits up like u/controlthenarrative? (seriously - you haven't lived 'til you've seen a CFO 'guh'). Plus, it's a great anecdote to spin the next time the cute barista mixing your decaf rainbow-spinkle frap with extra syrup looks bored enough to listen to you for more than five seconds (or, you know, tell it to your wife's boyfriend, your body pillow - YMMV). I'd actually been saving the full version for u/pokimane. It's that good. But, I'm bored, and I feel sufficiently generous to share it with you now. If you don't care, you can go back to beating your meat to your RH tickers. I can't tell you what to do.\n\nLet's get started.\n\n**Futures For Dummies**\n\nBefore I explain how all this works, a little history. Like many great ideas - sushi, Nintendo, used lingerie vending machines - futures originated with the Japs. Some smartass farmers in Osaka in the 1700s started trading rice on credit months in advance of the harvest in order (I assume) to hedge against some rogue samurai coming to take their shit. I don't know, I'm not a fucking historian. Anyway. This idea took off pretty fucking fast once people realized they could use this to both protect against losses and project future prices / demand for the shit they made and soon our tea-drinking cousins in Ye Olde England were doing it for whatever they make there - wool and Wensleydale? Who cares. And then it blew up in Chicago of all places (I guess because there are lots of farmers in the Midwest), and the Mercantile Exchange was born. Shoutout to the Second City (more than just the home of a [murder hotel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._H._Holmes) and shitty [baseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs) [teams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox)). Today you can trade futures in just about anything but the roots (and most important contracts) are still in commodities.\n\nAnyway. So what is a futures contract, exactly? It's basically like an option contract with a couple of extra features. Like an option, a futures contract is a derivative - an instrument the value of which is **derived** (hence, derivative) from the  price of an underlying asset. As we all hopefully know, options give you a \\*right\\* - but not an obligation - to buy or sell particular shit at a particular price on a particular date. Futures, on the other hand, \\*oblige\\* each party to the contract to deliver the goods or cash on the settlement date (depends on the exchange you're trading at - some allow for cash settlement, some don't). What does this mean for the individual trader? Consider the purchase of a naked put/call option. Your potential loss is limited to the premium you paid for each contract in the first place. You buy up front, and you either print tendies or you hold the bag depending on which way the price of the equity moves - red lines or green lines. You don't need to pony anything up on the expiration date if you don't want to.\n\nFutures expose you to a \\*much greater\\* risk (and reward) than options because you're signing up to deliver X product at $Y no matter what happens to the price of X product in the meantime. See, futures are highly leveraged. Instead of paying RH the $0.01 to buy a $SEAS death put against Ol' Fuzzy's advice, the broker asks you to put up a certain percentage of the contract up front and bear the risk and rewards of the fluctuations yourself over the life of the contract. You only pay a small portion of the price up front - whatever the broker determines is appropriate. It could be 10x or 20x (even 25 or 30x for really weird assets) less than the actual value of the contract. The value of your contract is then marked-to-market on an hourly, daily or weekly basis depending on the asset (this means that the price is adjusted based on the actual value of the underlying asset). As the price of the commodity (say, corn or whatever) fluctuates, your account gets debited or credited with the movement depending on your position on the contract. If it moves in the wrong direction, you need to post additional margin. If it moves in the right direction, you get a credit. You can either hold the contract 'til expiration and cash-settle, settle for the quantity of the actual shit you agreed to buy, or you can create a synthetic settlement early by opening an inverse position and netting the profits. It's up to you.\n\nThere's a whole lot more technical shit that goes into it that I'm not going to bother with here. I'm sure some nerd or JV trader will start acting smart in the comments and I'll be forced to flex my mind muscles on you and explain it in more detail. But I'll save that for later because that's not why we're here tonight. We're here to talk about.......\n\n**The Ballad of Big Dick Vick (Or: Why You Can't Trade Onion Futures Anymore)**\n\nImagine you're some podunk fucking farmer in the 1940s. You know what sucks? Your life. Mildred ain't putting out after your fifth kid died of consumption and everyone you know is either starving to death in the Dust Bowl because shit won't grow (shoutout [James 'OG' Agee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_Us_Now_Praise_Famous_Men)) or they're dead fighting Nazis in France. What could possibly get you through the day? Onions. They're cheap, easy to grow, and you can tie 'em on your belt (befitting the style of the time). Onions were so important to the economy at this point in American history that they became the most heavily traded commodity in the country. In fact, onion contracts made up 25% of daily futures volume at the Mercantile Exchange. Truly, they were the meme stock of their time. Amazing, right? Anyway.\n\nEnter Vincent W. Kosuga - Big Dick Vick to his friends (\\*may not be a real nickname). Like many of you autists, Vick was fucking poor. He had a failing celery farm and a fat wife, and that was about it. He was also a certified fucking maniac who always carried a gun and flew a home-made plane in his spare time. He was a character and a shitty farmer. But the man had a dream. A dream to make fuck-you money and give it to the Pope (seriously - the 50s were a wild time). So Vick heard about some fucking autist who'd made his fortune trading wheat futures and he figured 'well shit, I can do that'. Spoiler alert: he fucking couldn't. He nearly bankrupted himself - he got so poor that he couldn't even afford to grow celery anymore and all the seeds he could afford to buy were... onions. Yep. Onions.\n\nThis was Vick's lightbulb moment. A shitload of onions were grown in his neck of the woods, but in these pre-internet days, there was a time lag between the knowledge of available volume and the market's price, because the market was a long way away from the onions. So he and a pal called Sam (who owned the local grocery store and vegetable supplier) realized by travelling to Chicago themselves, they could use their insider knowledge of onion supply to bet big or short on the prices with an advantage over most other traders. They got pretty fucking rich pretty fucking fast doing this. But for Big Dick Vick, it wasn't enough. The man didn't just want to get rich anymore. He wanted to be the Onion King. So in the fall of 1955, Vick and Sam used their winnings to buy up virtually every long onions future available on the market, and demanded physical settlement, not cash. So far, so simple right. The hook? They **also** bought every short contract. Normally, this would be a recipe for playing yourself. With natural market forces and/or cash settlement, at best you net off with a small profit. But when you control the entire supply of the commodity? You can flood the market and crash the price, and make a fucking killing. And that's exactly what they did. There were fucking onions everywhere in Chicago. They started dumping them in the Chicago River but that clogged it up so they just let them rot in the street. If you've been to Chicago, you know what I'm talking about and that I'm not throwing any shade on your fine town, but it takes a lot to make Chicago smell worse than it already does - and the onions fucking did it. Onions, for a brief time, were literally worth less than the bags they came wrapped in. You could buy 50lbs of onions for a dime. People estimate Big Dick Vick made nearly $100 million off this trade - which was big fucking money in the 50's. But more importantly, Big Dick Vick pulled a big short 50 years before Margot Robbie got wet explaining to you (incorrectly) how CDOs work. I don't know how else to explain this to you - it's the only time in the *history of capitalism* that one man ever successfully cornered a commodity market. Shoutout BDV.\n\nNaturally, the government didn't like this. Neither did other onion farmers - considering Vick bankrupted most of them. They lobbied Congress who set up a Senate Committee into Big Dick Vick's onion monopoly. So what did BDV do? He told a Senate Committee hearing that \"if it's against the law to make money, I'm guilty\". Other than that, he denied all responsibility, and they couldn't do anything about it - he hadn't broken any laws. He cucked the government and all of his competitors in one fell swoop. He cashed his profits, moved home and opened a restaurant called *The Jolly Onion*. He wound up donating most of his cash to the Catholic Church, and he got his wish of meeting the Pope (he actually met three of them over the course of his life). In the meantime, the government didn't want to get cucked by him again, so they passed the [Onion Futures Act](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/7/13-1) \\- which specifically outlaws trading onion futures, and still exists in law today.\n\n**TL;DR** \\- long $ONIONS, short $GOVT, veggie printer goes grrrrrrow.", "created_utc": 1585656711.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fsbto9/the_ballad_of_big_dick_vick_onions_futures_and/", "is_self": true}
