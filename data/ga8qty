{"id": "ga8qty", "title": "Get ready for puts on GILD", "selftext": "EDIT: Alright GILD fell back to earth - NIAID might be putting some more details their [placebo controlled study](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04280705). That could be more legit and that MIGHT moon. I might do calls.\n\n[Here's what I said about GILD a bit of a while ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g8y4jt/daily_discussion_thread_for_april_27_2020/forcpua/)\n\nThe upcoming trial was non-placebo controlled - this thing was very unlikely to look bad, and the market has shown it will eat up any positive garbage (see past GILD leak, INO, MESO, etc.)\n\nOnce we look into the trial data, we'll realize it doesn't show that much. And once some actual placebo control trials come out in May, we'll see that remdesivir actually has a pretty limited role in treatment of coronavirus and is not the panacea that can move trillions in the market. \n\nRemdesivir's role in treatment is likely only early on in high risk patients. There is almost certainly an overreaction right now.\n\nEDIT:\n\nThat said, I don't think placebo controlled trials for REM are coming till May. So might take a bit. I might go cash gang or just keep buying weekly calls...we'll see how fast the market reacts. GI\n\nIt's already dumping a bit pre market. Hope I can still sell my calls....\n\n>Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) today announced topline results from the open-label, Phase 3 SIMPLE trial evaluating 5-day and 10-day dosing durations of the investigational antiviral remdesivir in hospitalized patients with severe manifestations of COVID-19 disease. The study demonstrated that patients receiving a 10-day treatment course of remdesivir achieved similar improvement in clinical status compared with those taking a 5-day treatment course (Odds Ratio: 0.75 [95% CI 0.51 \u2013 1.12] on Day 14). No new safety signals were identified with remdesivir across either treatment group. Gilead plans to submit the full data for publication in a peer-reviewed journal in the coming weeks.\n\nAll the study says is that a 10 day and 5 day regimen are similar....ok.\n\n>In this study, the time to clinical improvement for 50 percent of patients was 10 days in the 5-day treatment group and 11 days in the 10-day treatment group. More than half of patients in both treatment groups were discharged from the hospital by Day 14 (5-day: 60.0%, n=120/200 vs.10-day: 52.3% n=103/197; p=0.14). At Day 14, 64.5 percent (n=129/200) of patients in the 5-day treatment group and 53.8 percent (n=106/197) of patients in the 10-day treatment group achieved clinical recovery.\n\nFor non-severe patients?....really not particularly amazing.\n\nIt does say that mortality outside of Italy was <10% - potentially justifiable statement, but we know from the Chinese trial that was halted (lack of patients, but n>200) that it showed no difference vs. placebo. Basically we don't know that much more than we knew a few weeks back.\n\nhttps://www.gilead.com/news-and-press/press-room/press-releases/2020/4/gilead-announces-results-from-phase-3-trial-of-investigational-antiviral-remdesivir-in-patients-with-severe-covid-19", "created_utc": 1588164219.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ga8qty/get_ready_for_puts_on_gild/", "is_self": true}
