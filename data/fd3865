Options with 3 or less days are undergoing some nice actions. I wonder if the RH problems contributing to things. I would see an option bid 32 cents then quickly flash 2 bucks etc. getting fills then waiting closing out etc.. 120 to 300 dollars per scalp. Its a bit of work but averaging 800-1240 dollars a day. Eventually things will calm down. Fills are fast. Not every trade is profitable but I like to cut losses quick and I get out when things get dicey and get in again when new opportunities come up. As long as wins are greater then losses all is good.\n\nHopefully the next few days we keep this up.", "created_utc": 1583276323, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fd3865/who_is_taking_both_sides_of_spy_scalping_options/", "is_self": true}
