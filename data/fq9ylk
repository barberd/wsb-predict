{"id": "fq9ylk", "title": "Call someone this weekend", "selftext": "I know we will all be dreaming of sweet fresh blood on Monday so our puts can print (if you bought calls, please wear your helmet outdoors for the safety of others), but don't forget about that person you've meant to call for while... those people you haven't spoken to before the outbreak and especially those people that live alone. It's been about 1-2 weeks for most people in the US and longer for other parts of the world to be on somewhat of a lockdown.....people will handle this differently. Call your mom, call your wife's boyfriend's ex husband, that friend from college, someone. You'll feel better, you'll make them feel better, but also find out what's happening in their area and do your own research. Find out what companies are doing, who's getting laid off, who's still working etc.\n\nI originally was going write this as a DD post, but we all know this.....hospitals are fucked. I just called my cousin, who I haven't spoken to in a while, as he works at Long Beach Memorial Hospital (that's Los Angeles for our fuzzy foreigners). But, he obviously said, \"Shits getting fucking crazy as hell.\" They are running out of everything, vents, gloves, nurses are putting on old N95s then putting an old hospital mask over it. An entire floor converted to Covid-19 and it's already full. LA is about 1-2 weeks away from NY and most hospitals in LA are already stuggling. Then he drives around and beaches and parks are full to the max; some people are taking is seriously, but most people aren't giving a shit. But we all know this.....we aren't flatting the curve enough, hospitals are fucked, people will die, puts will print...so I thought I'd bring up something else here.\n\nMaybe don't check futures till Sunday, close pornhub for 30 min and give someone a call this weekend.... check in with them, make sure they are alright, and see what's happening in their area.\n\nSPY 4/24 220p & 200p", "created_utc": 1585356686.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fq9ylk/call_someone_this_weekend/", "is_self": true}
