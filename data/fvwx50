Certainly, many knew they could afford it but went ahead anyways. The banks loaned out to practically everyone, sold their mortgage backed securities to investors then jacked themselves to the tits on credit default swaps. The banks were the main villain in the housing crisis.\n\nThe interesting contrast is that 12 years after the crash, not only are the banks helping, they frankly are the go-between for the Fed and the average Joe. While the banks were the arson\u2019s only 2008, they are going to be the fire fighters going in to save individuals via water houses and protective equipment courtesy the treasury and the Fed. Between loan forbearance, commitment to retaining employees, and granting these small business loans via Uncle Sam, they are going to stand on the right side of when all of this concludes.  \n\nI think it creates an interesting dynamic from a reputation standpoint. $BAC already has their small business loan program up and running, and JPM is not far behind. It is also interesting that you could make the argument these were some of the strongest banks in 2008 because they both did their part to bailout smaller banks (Merrill Lynch and Washington Mutual respectively). Maybe they see this as their chance of gaining back some favor with Americans, and knowing that the Fed has their back if this time they run into liquidity problems not from recklessness, but quite literally saving people\u2019s businesses. \n\nPositions wise: I like $JPM more than BAC but that\u2019s a personal preference. \n\nJamie \ud83d\udc8e is \ud83d\udc02 gang and he will lead the way.", "created_utc": 1586171535.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fvwx50/jamie_dimon_has_joined_the_bull_gang_cnbc_jamie/", "is_self": true}
