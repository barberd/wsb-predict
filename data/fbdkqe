I\u2019m starting to wonder if going forward it makes sense to buy Puts on PLNT before the CDC acknowledges the \ud83c\udf7a\ud83e\udda0 as a pandemic. I\u2019d have to imagine fitness clubs would be breeding grounds for this kind of thing. I could see PLNT falling even more over the next few weeks as more reports come out about Americans who don\u2019t know where they came in contact with the virus. On the flip side, I could see taking a Call position on PTON as more people opt to stay home.
