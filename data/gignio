{"id": "gignio", "title": "Two big earnings plays for maximum tendies, RCL and PLT", "selftext": "#Wow this looks like a lot of words, why should I bother?\n\nLast week I introduced you guys to [SDC](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gf9cr0/your_next_earning_play_for_big_gains_sdc_tldr/), a stock that profited call holders upwards of 500%. The week before I told you about my [MTCH play](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9na5t/why_mtch_will_be_your_next_1000_play/) which was an easy and predictable win. Even before that, I've made good calls on earning plays throughout Q1 (snap calls, twtr puts, etc). With a pretty decent track record, I wanted to discuess what I think are my next big movers (in the uppies direction) for earnings next week. \n\n#Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL)\n\nThe first is [RCL, they're releasing earnings 8am on May 20th](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/rcl). Now why would I bother with a cruise line?.. Well all know the coronavirus pandemic has hammered the cruise industry, which shuttered operations in mid-March after a series of outbreaks at sea. The thing is, investors will be looking for any signs of life as the economy starts opening back up. They\u2019ll be trading for future value, not the fact that the company has made no money recently. Consider all the people who haven't been out in MONTHS that are now [itching to fucking get on a cruise](https://www.tmz.com/2020/05/09/carnival-bookings-spike-increase-cruises-resuming-august/). If you're not interested in this one because you think it's a risky play, just skip over to the PLT DD I've written down below. The thing is, shares have good support at the $37 price level since its lows post-covid. Sailings are supposed to [resume June 12 with CDC approval.](https://www.royalcaribbean.com/cruise-ships/itinerary-updates). \n\nIn addition to this, there were [talks of bond offerings back in April](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-23/royal-caribbean-in-talks-for-more-financing-to-ride-out-shutdown?sref=DWzi38c2) with no subsequent announcement, so that\u2019s good. The potential for this offering would provide for an easy pop in price. Also, [they've been put on a debt holiday granted by Germany](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-24/snubbed-in-u-s-rescue-cruise-lines-get-relief-from-germany). For those who don't know, this 12-month debt holiday is meant to provide hundreds of millions in additional liquidity between now and April 2021. With liquidity being tight, [operating expenses have overall been reduced](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/royal-caribbean-group-provides-business-update-301055738.html) and will most likely stay reduced for the most part as this will result in a faster 'bounce-back' and higher profits for the future. [If all of that wasn't enough, they've even patented a covid19 face mask for cruise ship purposes only, and we all know they're gonna sell fucking *millions* of those](https://thepointsguy.com/news/royal-caribbean-cruise-seaface-mask/).\n\nThe stock is up over the last month but is down over the last 7 days, making it a prime candidate to ride up towards earnings as its share price was over $41 just days ago. Any positive market news unrelated to the industry the stock should follow with some gains as well. It's important to know that they\u2019ve been through the worst of it already. All the numbers are known. They aren\u2019t at risk of going under right now. They have enough liquidity to weather the rest of the year without needing to issue debt. Reminder, this is not a long term play. It\u2019s an earnings play. And for that reason I'm eyeing the 5/22 exp. $38. Premiums are high with ATM contracts, so you can go for OTM too. \n\n#Plantronics Inc. (PLT)\n\nOkay, so PLT needs an actual intro. Plantronics is an American electronics company producing audio communications equipment for business and consumers. Its products support unified communications, mobile use, gaming and music. [Their earnings is on May 21, 4:05pm.](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/plt). This company is is similar to [HEAR](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/hear) a stock that rose from $6 to $11.50 in anticipation for earnings, was overbought and then had some pullback afterwards. Also note the rise that [LOGI is enjoying right now and has been for the last week](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/logi). This is why I'm telling you about these earning plays in advance, so we can play on the run-up, rather than buy high IV contracts the day before earnings and have the potential to lose our money. Regardless, [here's some juicy numbers on why I think they'll beat earnings.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/poly-provides-business-update-301040748.html). The tl;dr is that they've raised guidance to the top end of guidance from the previous earnings release and could possibly blow past that. In addition to this they suspended their quarterly dividend which shows some good faith when it comes to maintaining their liquidity (and saves them $25m/yr) and deferred any debt repayments until Q1 2021 (comes from their 8-K filed on 4/15). [The current consensus on the target price for PLT shares between all analysts is $18.00 per share](https://dbtnews.com/2020/05/11/plantronics-inc-plt-is-currently-13-06-below-its-200-period-moving-avg-what-dose-this-mean/) as of May 11th. \n\nThere were some supply chain disruptions (facility shutdowns) in Mexico due to covid19 that were supposed to be closed 4/14 through 4/30, so they should be back online now. As of right now they have $226m in liquidity so no risks of financial trouble at the moment. All in all, a good solid earnings about to come from them and should see a nice run up to earnings and even maybe a pop the day after. $15c 6/19 is the recommended play. Because June 19th is pretty far away these contracts have a sweet delta and low theta those of us who are getting in early enough before IV crush kills our play.\n\n**tldr:** Covid19 is clearing up for cruise stocks, RCL would be a good buy right now as their fundamentals are solid. As for PLT, it will go up before earnings similarly to HEAR and LOGI. \n\n**tldr of the tldr:** RCL 37c, PLT 15c", "created_utc": 1589306736.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gignio/two_big_earnings_plays_for_maximum_tendies_rcl/", "is_self": true}
