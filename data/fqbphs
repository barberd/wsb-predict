However I've been paying a lot of attention to the PhD epidemiologists and MDs here in Seattle, and I thought I'd share a few things they've linked.\n\nSo UW Medical Center has been on top of this shit since the very beginning.  They have a highly-esteemed epidemiology program, and most of their predictions have come true so far.  I trust them; the only reason Seattle isn't an absolute catastrophe like NYC is because of UW Med Center and Fred Hutch sounding the alarm early, and everyone here listening to them (unlike the rest of the country...).\n\nThey released a new tool using epidemiology models, attempting to predict peak resource use:\n\nhttps://covid19.healthdata.org/projections\n\nThis tool is really useul and morbidly fascinating, it provides a ton of information.\n\nNote that this isn't predicting # of infections, it's focusing on hospitalizations and deaths.  Why? Well as everyone in this sub knows, the data we have on # of infections is both noisy and likely inaccurate due to lack of testing.  Building models on inaccurate data generally doesn't end well.  But hospitalizations and deaths are a pretty good indicator of how bad things are going to get, and they aren't affected by test shortages as much. And the lack of hospital beds and ventilators is why we shut down the economy in the first place (thus most useful for trading IMO). \n\nSome takeaways after playing with this tool:\n\n* They predict we'll need 231k beds, 35k ICU beds, and 19k ventilators nationwide\n* They predict a shortage of ~50k beds, ~15k ICU beds, and ~19k ventilators nationwide\n* They predict 80k people will die nationwide (yikes)\n* This is a *model*, and like all models, there is still a lot of uncertainty as to what will actually happen IRL.  The real world is more complex.  Thus, the model includes *confidence intervals*. For those too dumb to know what that means, it means the numbers I wrote above are expected values, but it could be a lot better or a lot worse based on the data we have right now.  Just like weather models, as time moves on, these confidence intervals should start to get smaller and smaller, reflecting increasing certainty.\n  * The number of beds needed could range between 118k to 465k.  If it's on the higher end, then we'll have a MUCH higher hospital bed shortage. If it's on the lower end, we might get out of this without a ton of people dying.\n   * **Do NOT bitch at scientists in three weeks if the expected value is not precise.  Only bitch at them if it's outside of these confidence intervals.**  (Even then, they're doing the best they can, so maybe just be nice?)\n* Peak resource usage (based on predicted # of hospitalizations) **will be on April 14 for the country**.  If the true values end up in the middle or upper end of the confidence interval, we can expect people to start dying in the ER lobby or at home a few days before this. Maybe base your trading decisions around this date. \n  * You can also drill into this data by state, which shows that NY is absolutely fucked, and the South isn't looking great either. **NY's peak resource date is also projected to come earlier than the rest of the country (April 6)**, so keep that in mind. \n* The model is based on the current orders from state governments (school's being closed, non-essential-businesses being closed, and stay-at-home orders).  If state governments add more restrictions (like travel bans) or lift restrictions, this model's predictions will change.\n  * **THE CURVE ONLY STAYS FLAT IF THESE ORDERS ARE KEPT IN PLACE.** Even after April, if these orders are lifted you can expect the curve to go back up again.  Maybe heat will slow it down, but that's unclear, and the summer won't last forever anyway.\n\nThe big question I have is, how much of this priced in?  Who the fuck knows.  News out of NYC is already bleak, so maybe that part is priced in.  I don't think the market realizes how bad it's gonna hit the rest of the country though.  I'm also sure boomers are not paying attention to this UW Med Center tool, considering they've ignored everything UW Med has said so far.  \n\nHere are my positions.  I'm still holding puts from last week, which have fucked me, and doubled down this week. I'm a bit worried about my 4/24 puts cause of theta and the IV crush, but I'm thinking the others will be fine. \n\nDIS $80p 4/24\n\nSPY $220p 4/24\n\nDIS $80p 5/1\n\nDIS $80p 6/19\n\nMandatory \"don't fucking dance\".  I'm still hoping that the lower bound of the confidence interval comes true.
