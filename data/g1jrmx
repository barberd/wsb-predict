If y'all listened to me yesterday for Alteryx you could have made a pretty penny but the real dollars are to be made closer to earnings in early May, no worries if you missed that play, we'll see some ups and down between now and then.\n\n**What's your Gay DD?**\n\nSo here comes the diarrhea that I'm going to squirt into your collective mouths about the next play. And you've heard it a million times before. Good ole' TSLA. What do I have to say that hasn't been said before? Market Cap that would make Enron blush? Meme stock owned by retards on RH who buy the first stock they think about while blowing loads to Elon? Played out.\n\nNo, this is a lot more boring than that. We're going into some stupid numbers, with actual facts and assumptions. Shitty and gross I know.\n\nEarnings are next week on Wednesday, and no I don't care about the people who claim earnings won't matter because of the economic climate or that TSLA exists on a plane on existence that surpasses the need for regular financial reporting. When your stock is on some sort of retard strength rampage, a good old earnings miss if sweet sedative flowing into your bloodstream. This isn't going to help the people that shorted a long time ago, Tesla has way too much Cash and some decent cash flow to really be a Going Concern here, they are fine.\n\nBut 750$ fine? No way. I see us at least going back to 550-500. The Puts are cheaper than they may seem.\n\n**Can I see the details behind your shitty DD?**\n\nMaybe. I have this all together in some sort of really shitty excel file, feel free to DM for it. But we're going to play this by text.\n\nA) Check their delivery numbers for Q1 (already out and crazily enough, this news didn't do anything to share price. Why? Because investors do not have the IQ required to interpolate the delivery numbers into implied marginal profitability numbers when real EPS goes out next week. )\n\n[https://ir.tesla.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tesla-q1-2019-vehicle-production-deliveries](https://ir.tesla.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tesla-q1-2019-vehicle-production-deliveries)\n\n88,000 vehicles delivered, nearly 22k less than Q4 2020 (110K), (the one that kicked everything off). That's the play everyone, thanks for reading, I'll catch you at the Sandals in Aruba.\n\n**My shit's all gay and I talk kind of retarded**\n\nNo my guy, that's not the play. Check the split. YoY from Q1 2019, they have failed to budge the numbers of their truly profitable vehicles they sold (they sold 12k X/S Models a year ago as well).  All of their growth has come from selling an extra 6,000 Model 3 (Maybe a few Y? they claimed to start delivering in March but this can't be a material balance) in this Quarter Year over Year. As I type this, I cannot believe I'm talking about $120B Market Cap Company, my DD is about what literally them selling a few thousand cars. Either way, they are not growing the segment that is driving profits. At all.\n\nYour kids are going to be watching documentaries at school on the Tesla Bubble as investors realize just how high the market cap is given that both their top line and bottom line growth are likely done. (Not even taking into account we're entering a fucking recession where people don't buy cars, and oil is free, thus diminishing the push for actually electric vehicles).\n\n**Plenty of others have called the Top for Tesla, what makes this different?**\n\nI can guarantee two things,: Tesla will remain in business a long time. They have tons of Cash, and Debt that is more than manageable given their cash flows. Their cars are desirable by some and are status symbols. Elon has thrust the electric car into the mainstream, delivered on his promise to sell a 30kish electric car, and forced the rest of the industry adapt. Tesla really is a great success story. They worked their asses off for this.\n\nAnd here's the other half of the promise. By 2022 shares will sit around 200 or so, probably less. (much less). GM, considered a flaming pile of dogshit by almost any standard, just wrapped up selling about 600,000 vehicles, and it was a baaad quarter. For them at least. Last FY they made $6 Billion in clean profit and gave all of it away in the form of buybacks and dividends. GM may be a pile of shit but they know how to sell cars (trucks and SUV's actually but that's another story) and make money while doing so, at least while shit kickers can still borrow to buy silverados n shit.\n\nTesla has been able to spin their narrative absolutely perfectly. They already thought of my argument, people will claim that they also have revenue in the energy or whatever the fuck. It represented 6% of their fucking revenue. Please.\n\n**Oh boy this turned into more of some pyscho rant than DD**\n\nIt sure did. Buy LEAP puts in 2022 or if you're feeling cool, 4/24. If you believe that missed earnings can move the needle, do it. If not, LEAP. I'm much more confident about the earnings miss than the reaction to it. Again I can provide the shitty ass Excel, your call. Their non automotive revenue is super flat and predictable, so is SG&A and R&D, and even their margins, the huge drop in X/S model sales leaves a huge hole to bring Revenue down to what I see to be $5.5 Billion for Q1, my EPS Target is -.40.", "created_utc": 1586919753.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1jrmx/tsla_dd_453291/", "is_self": true}
