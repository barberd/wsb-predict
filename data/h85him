I put all my winnings from AAL into LATAM and just after buying it, It goes up 20% with the help of my autism. The next day I see the charts not updating, so I assume its a glitch (at this point 100% retardation has occurred) I find it has been delisted and I've lost 35%. Which would make sense since it filed chapter 11 (110% retard) Are delisted stocks likely to relist or have I been fucked on 2nd big trade?", "created_utc": 1592046152.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h85him/first_retard_play/", "is_self": true}
