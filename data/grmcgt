These guys are EXTREMELY intelligent businessmen and to say they are passionate about cars is an understatement.  Toto has been running the Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 team and Lawrence freaking bought a team so his son could play racing car driver.\n\nDBX SUV is coming out soon.  Everyone loves SUVs, even $200k ones.  We now have 8yr 0% interest loans, so errrrbody gonna get one.\n\nEV supercars are in the works.  \n\nJames Bond film due out and you know it will have plenty of eye candy.....cars and women.  \n\nIt\u2019s going to take some time to turn it around, so don\u2019t expect quick gains right away.", "created_utc": 1590595157.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/grmcgt/light_dd_aston_martin/", "is_self": true}
