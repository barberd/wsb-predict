Play this however you want.\n\nStitch fix is on a tear over the last year beating eps every quarter. Earnings to be reported June 8. Anal-ysts are expecting super low eps due to people reducing their discretionary spending. I call bullshit on this for two reasons. 1. It's a solid $BECKY (See: LULU) stock play with millions of women sitting at home with nothing to do but shop online. SFIX clothes are generally on the affordable end of the spectrum and high quality. 2. Current clients are too dumb or too lazy to cancel their current subscription. I know from experience when my wife signed me up and we tried to cancel only to receive a \"personally curated\" box of clothes in the mail the next month.\n\nMy price target $33 after earnings.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention that them laying off 1400 workers in California to hire 2000 workers sonewhere it doesn't cost $76 to get an avocado toast and a kombucha margarita will also play well.", "created_utc": 1591206051.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gvyifa/sfix_2530_612_debit_call_spread/", "is_self": true}
