As a contrarian pessimist, I can say that you guys get the cake.\n\nBut in the back of my mind, I'm thinking, \"How's the VIX? Been a while since I've seen that thing make the news.\" And it's hovering around 13.50. Just broke 1 year low. The contrarian pessimist in me says, \"Surely this is it! The next bad tweet will send this skyrocketing!\" But I don't know when, and I don't feel like letting theta destroy my dignity while I wait. If there's one thing I have learned, it's that the stock market likes to grow slowly over time with short, dramatic selloffs occasionally decorating the charts for the sake of variety. So here's my plan.\n\nVIX ATH in the last crash was above 50. ATL was Sep 2017 at about 9.50. We're at 13.50 right now. Bull or bear, I think we can all agree that this has been a LONG bull run. With the end of every bull market, one can expect high volatility. On top of that, Q4 is usually a volatile quarter because of end of year accounting. Companies need to get rid of any short term losses they may be holding for tax purposes. So here we are, late bull cycle, Q4, trade war, and VIX hovering around ATL. \n\nI can't say when, because the market can be irrational longer than I can be solvent. I don't feel like letting options destroy my capital waiting for the market to agree with me. But holding a leveraged volatility fund? At this point it just seems stupid not to do it.\n\nIn the short term, the market will display irrational exuberance before the bubble bursts. My trading money is still going with the trend to buy SPY calls as long as the market is blissfully happy. But of the $40 range between $10 and $50 in which the VIX has ALWAYS traded, we're in the bottom 10% of that very consistent tunnel. And with a leveraged fund like TVIX, that could turn into astronomical returns the next time Mr. Market forgets to take his meds.", "created_utc": 1571198185, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dijr5a/short_term_spy_calls_long_term_vix_buys/", "is_self": true}
