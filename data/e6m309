{"id": "e6m309", "title": "$ABUS Potential Buyout", "selftext": " Today, I am presenting the official WSB lottery play. After calling $ARWR at $28 a STRONG buy I am going to be discussing my next big play. I believe that Arbutus Biopharma $ABUS will get bought out after their phase 1 trials in January-March. \n\nWhat is Abus? \n\nThey are a one drug company that is focusing on the hepatitis B infection, a disease of the lvier caused by HBV. Worldwide, there are about 250million with hepatitis B infection and an estimated 1 million each year die from complications of HBV. This is a major market with lots of potential money. \n\nWhy ABUS?\n\nABUS only has a market cap of around 126 million, extremely undervalued compared to the other 3 companies developing HBV drugs. Of the 4 HBV drugs in trials, 3 are partnered. ARWR has a licensing deal with Janssen receiving $250 million cash and up to $3.5B in milestones. Roche\u2019s partnership with Dicerna paid $200 million upfront with up to $1.47B in milestones. Finally, ALNY received an undisclosed upfront payment with up to $1B in milestones. With these valuations we can assume ABUS will get a similar deal equivalent to around $8-$10 in reflecting share price. \n\nWhat are the catalysts?\n\nABUS is releasing their phase 1 trials sometime between January and March, around the same time all the other companies got partnered. Based off the previous data, a large investor holding over 2.4million shares has said that the data is looking better than ARWR\u2019s.\n\nThe play\n\nJune 19, 2020 calls $5 strike price are only around 0.15 to 0.20. If the buyout occurs around $8.50 then a $750 investment will net $25,000.", "created_utc": 1575573776, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e6m309/abus_potential_buyout/", "is_self": true}
