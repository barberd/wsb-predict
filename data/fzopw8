{"id": "fzopw8", "title": "BBRRRRR-BLUFFF here's why the money printer is a huge bluff", "selftext": "Investors are worried that the fed will start printing money to buy stonks. They would need to print $100 Trillion to prevent a collapase. OR they would need to manipulate investors into buying/holding $100 Trillion in stonks. IF they print it will cause hyper inflation and destroy the US dollar and the stonk market with it. That's why its a bluff. They are banking on if they buy some debt and lower interest rates, would think \"oh damn they serious, they dont throw $2 trillion and then another $2 trillion, they wont mind buying $100 trillion\" and you idiots are so easily manipulated into think OMG THE MONEY PRINTINGER GONNA GO INFINATE. Telling you they don't care vs actually printing infiate money are two different things.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRight now all they said is they will do Infinate QE, but they know if it restores confidence in the market (and it has cus stonks gone up), they won't have to. The bluff is a **confidence scheme.** They did this in 1929.
