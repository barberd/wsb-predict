Months ago I find /r/wsb amongst the middenheap of trolly subs that were heralded long ago. You were the /r/trp of /r/personalfinance\n\nChads swinging huge, hollow candlestick dicks and spinning TSLA, AMD, and FB plates like they were your bitches. Hell, some of you even made money off of meme weed stocks.\n\nThen Virgin /u/Achaidas strolls in with his slouching P&L and weak, papery hands. I had nothing and desired less.\n\nThen I deposited my first $10 into RH in an attempt to mimic the Gods Who Walked Among Men. I lost it in a penny stock. Then I deposited $70 and tried to \u201cplay the market\u201d whatever the fuck that meant and make money off of AMD. The next day INTEL released a better chip or some shit.\n\nSo here I am today, -46.2820% and finally, FINALLY, my 4/20 SPY $300c is climbing those bars like a champ. My penniless ass is finding euphoria in between the margins of pennies.\n\n$244.49! So much ask volume!\n$245.82! Look at that spread\n$247.27! We\u2019re breaking $250 and shooting to $300 baby!\n\n249.23.... 249.23.... hold.... $248.34... it\u2019ll rise again... $247.82... maybe it\u2019s just a delay in my free wagecuck ticker...\n\n+33% return... +23% return... -13%.... -25% return...\n\nWell there goes my $70 dollars I guess I\u2019ll just make another deposit tomorrow.\n\nI\u2019m a wageslave.
