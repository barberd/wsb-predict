{"id": "brjjla", "title": "I get better prices with market orders, why use limit orders?", "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been trying my hand at intra-day day trading, usually on pull backs on stocks with 9 to 20 dollars share price. At least 200K volume. I don't hold long, typically 1 to 30 minutes. I do 6 to 8 trades per day, anywhere between 20K to 40K dollar orders. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I place a market order (using TD Ameritrade) on a stock with a 9.86/9.87 bid and ask, and, for example 4000 share size, I will typically get a price between 9.86 and 9.87. So, I might get a 9.866 purchase price. Yes, sometimes I will see slippage, the market maker might give a partial fill at 9.87 and then more at 9.875, but not on the vast majority of the market orders.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4000 x .0033 = 13.2 dollars.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI essentially just paid for the commissions with those fractions of cents. If I had placed a limit order for 9.87, I would guarantee the price, but I would lose out on the fractional cents that paid for the trade. I'm just not seeing enough slippage to force me to use limit orders.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe math works the same on the sell. I rarely sell at the bid: it's usually between the bid and the ask.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, why use limit orders?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is your experience with other brokers? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can only assume with a no commission service like RobinHood you might not get this \"preferentially\" pricing.", "created_utc": 1558493880, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/brjjla/i_get_better_prices_with_market_orders_why_use/", "is_self": true}
