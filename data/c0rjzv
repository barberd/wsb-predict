{"id": "c0rjzv", "title": "Account Balance Negative and No idea why", "selftext": "Sorry this will be a long post but I have no idea why balance is negative. I recently got an internship and thought I would invest my pay checks. So as of Friday last week I had $1400 dollars in my account and I decided to options trade (risky I know). Up till that point I had stocks in Micron and Microsoft and Baba\n\nI bought a Disney Put Spread and a Netflix Iron Condor.\n\nThe netflix iron condor was worth $242 claiming a maximum loss of $358\n\nand the Disney was worth $29 . Both Expire on 6/14 (today)\n\nOn Monday I deposited another $1450 dollars into my account and upgraded to gold.\n\nI was asked If I wanted to use margin and I thought why not. I also saw that you cannot use MARGIN to purchase options. I didn't think i would use the margin but it wouldnt hurt to have the option is what I thought.\n\nToday I decided to buy a Call Credit Spread of BYND for $474 expiring in November and a baba put credit spread worth $127\n\nMy netflix option was a total sham and I lost the $358 dollars but made the disney option spread of $29\n\nMy account closed the day at 4:00 pm with a value of $1590 dollars.\n\nI check an hour later and I have -$-6868.08 AND -$-16,000 in buying power\n\nIt says that the options that expired today are still pending but I have no idea anymore whats going on. WHY THE FUCK DOES IT SAY $5800 dollars of margin used when I hadn't used any?? Did I make a mistake somewhere? Someone please explain to me what is going on. I have included screenshots but if anymore information is needed to help clarify this and explain to me what is happening feel free to ask I will be staring at this mess for a long time. Thank you any help or clarification is appreciated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/2v9gfjo74f431.png\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/sesnubf54f431.png\n\n \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/5tyuak094f431.png\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/g01wsada4f431.png\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/tb9pzadc4f431.png", "created_utc": 1560559955, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c0rjzv/account_balance_negative_and_no_idea_why/", "is_self": true}
