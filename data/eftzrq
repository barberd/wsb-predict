{"id": "eftzrq", "title": "AMD Calls", "selftext": "AMD has been rallying up the past couple weeks. This past week the stock has jumped up a dollar at market open everyday. I predict it will do the same today and Friday.  AMD is also the supplier of the next gen console, Xbox series x and the ps5, and current gen GPU\u2019s and CPU\u2019s. Going off the current gen numbers there has been 100 million ps4\u2019s sold. So there\u2019s big profit potential for AMD in the gaming market. Not to mention they\u2019ve been coming out with increasingly more affordable gpu and cpus to compete with intel. AMD will for sure hit $100 in 2020.", "created_utc": 1577356507, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eftzrq/amd_calls/", "is_self": true}
