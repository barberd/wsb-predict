{"id": "fjm5nt", "title": "So I've been farming puts as hard as anyone, but dint forget that stonks only go up. 5G explosion when this blows over.", "selftext": "It's time to start thinking about what we do with our sweet sweet tendies when this gravy train ends. Been averaging down on NOK and ERIC LEAPS since January, I'd advise the Autistsic hordes to follow. This is literally the only long position I'm concerned enough about to average down. I really think this is *THE* play.\n\nNOK recently set a record for transfer rates. \n\nThese seem to be the lead candidates the US administration and EU are looking at to combat Huawei/China in the 5g space. \n\nThere's a TON of protectionism in this market, because of cyber-security concerns, including rumours of encouraging/subsidizing an American company to buyout Nokia. \n\n5g infrastructure is pretty much set and in place, of which Nokia has the lions share of the US and Ericcson has a lot in Europe.\n\n But hardware doesn't make the money, LISCENSING does. And that should start rolling in soon, even ATT finally admitted their 5g is fake and the REAL 5g is coming now with the new gen of devices. \n\nFor these reasons these are your best 2 bets to get in on this. Samsung is also a good play, but the cost is higher. Cisco is a shit play and an incompetent company who will find a way to miss out on this. UNLESS they buyout NOK (see above,) in which case NOK is still the better play.\n\n[positions](https://imgur.com/a/1Q5X94a)", "created_utc": 1584370322.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjm5nt/so_ive_been_farming_puts_as_hard_as_anyone_but/", "is_self": true}
