IMO the user interface takes a little longer to get used to, but once you have it down it is much more user friendly.\n\nIf there is interest I will do another video that showcases more of the Apps features.\n\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSWCOCrPAks&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSWCOCrPAks&amp;feature=youtu.be) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCheers,\n\nA fellow AUTIST who is still holding MSFT 200C 3/20", "created_utc": 1583192990, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fcli87/quick_video_of_how_to_buy_options_on_think_or/", "is_self": true}
