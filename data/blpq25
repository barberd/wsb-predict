My native language is not English, I'm Chinese, there must be some mistakes in such long content, but I will try my best. Of course, If someone can help, it will be better . I promise the following are completely true. for those who are interested in this and who know the Chinese Language, you can go to the platform sites or portal sites to verify what I said. China's p2p industry is the only industry that can legally fraud.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy purpose is spreading it, cuz I was surprised that I can't find the detailed pertinent information on google or bing.\n\n.thousands of platforms crashed.nearly 10 million people are involved in it, but events are not that simple. I hope there are any mainstream media or Finance media (CNN\u3001BBC\u3001Bloomberg\u3001MarketWatch...etc.) release news regarding it, or can anyone contact? I have tried to do this, but it all failed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor decades, there are numerous non-governmental organizations attracted non-official funds with high yields in China, most of them are Ponzi schemes. but with China's first online P2P platform PPdai established, there are many non-governmental organizations with the purpose of fraud had moved on the internet.there are at least 7000 platforms existed in a few years. according to collapse last year, To be sure,90%+ percent of them are scams.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn recent years, everyone can establish a P2P platform in China if they want to,it's as simple as starting a company.everyone can makes use of Ponzi scheme method(because of bonds are not independent for better experience) to through the early phase,and absconded with the funds or withhold funds(using for offset bad debts or paying interest which is extracted when lending) before investment funds are no longer increasing,all you need to do is disguise it well.\n\neven though a few of them are not fraud platforms,  they also to be experimental platforms, inexperienced.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe P2P industry is viewed as the virtual currency by Chinese gov.once a scam crashes, the victims will be treated as the accomplices.\n\nThe demonstration, communicate on communication tools, complaining on the web, all of these are not allowed for social stability. even suicide should also be suicide silently.\n\nOtherwise, you'll be caught on a bus. the QQ Group(likes MSN Group) you stay will be banned.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is the experience of investing in a scam P2P Platform?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nImagine you're watching \"Game of Thrones\" on HBO, there is a P2P Platform(3 years old) AD at the end of the movie. (or Fintech Board on Amazon...or browsing the web somewhere...etc.)\n\nYou are interested in it, you checked the reputation of that platform on several portal sites, it looks fine, apparently, they are advertising everywhere although the ranking is not high.\n\nthe platform does not promise that the funds are secured. but there were platforms listed on the stock market in P2P industry, they have been operating safely for several years, from the high rate of return to the current low rate of return since a few years ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou finally decided to invest in it, it's a financial product on the platform which automatically invests various independent projects for a fixed term.that makes a lot of lending projects are including it.\n\nEverything is fine. after all, it works like a Ponzi scheme, the bad debts have never been exposed, although the rate of return is high but you think they'll balance it well, otherwise how dare it advertising? (even if the bad debt rate is disclosed, it's fake.)\n\nAs time goes by, your investment amount is increasing.but one day, some investors are claiming that they can't get the funds back when financial products are expired.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou asked the customer service department for this.they promised that funds will be paid back after a few days or weeks.\n\nMeanwhile, you have checked the projects that automatically chosen by financial product, these projects have never been released on the platform.\n\nWhy does this happen? these projects(matching subprime borrowers, each 1000-4000 CNY only) have a higher NPL(non-performing loans) ratio without a mature automatic risk control system.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are signs that the quite a few of borrowers have never repaid, which means the investors just participated in an experiment probably, or it's just a scam entirely even if it has been in operation for 3 years.\n\nMore than that, tens of millions CNY of investment projects have been found among the projects.which be suspected of investing in real estate, even unfinished deserted building, even the funds have not been invested in real estate.\n\nSoon there are close to all of the projects(under the financial products) are expired, the platform completely withholds recovered [funds.in](https://funds.in) the early phase, you can provide evidence by contact borrowers to force they payback the investment funds, but not lasting long.\n\nThe investors call the police, call the economic crime investigator, but without effect. The founder claims that all projects are real.everything is legal.we are collecting debts, you have to wait for [it.at](https://it.at) the same time, customer service staff are leaving.\n\nAfter a month, they are forced to develop the creditor's rights transfer system which makes investors be able to purchase or sell creditor's rights. for a platform that unable to cover non-performing loans, in fact, it's platform buying creditor's rights, the investors have to suffer huge losses.\n\nUntil now, you discovered that the positive comments regarding the platform are posted by employees they hired. the funds also invest in shareholder's companies. What is this doing? It's too late.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, all investments must be returned to investors as much as possible, but for a dead P2P platform in China P2P industry, they have already gained profits when lending. the non-performing loans or bad debts are only [left.to](https://left.to) continue the business is no longer generate profits. In this case, why not keep the funds of investors to themselves as much as possible in a lawless industry? That's what they think.\n\nWhether lending freely with a purpose of fraudulence or experimental, the beneficiaries of the platform would rather bribe local regulator to maximize profits, and harvesting investors by creditor's rights trading system at a low cost.due to there is no rule stipulate P2P Platform can't lend the funds to borrowers as presents in the law.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nActually, above all of these that's what happened to me.the name of the platform is \u9322\u76c6\u7db2(\u9322\u76c6 = MoneyPot), the founder is Huaqiang Liang(\u6881\u83ef\u5f37), he established a wine cup brand called \"Athena Goddess\"(\u96c5\u5178\u5a1c\u5973\u795e) whose operating on Tmall(belong to Alibaba),and he is operating a water plant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMoneyPot(\u9322\u76c6\u7db2) Team Introduction\n\n[https://tieba.baidu.com/p/4124109533?red\\_tag=3371759047&amp;qq-pf-to=pcqq.c2c&amp;traceid=](https://tieba.baidu.com/p/4124109533?red_tag=3371759047&amp;qq-pf-to=pcqq.c2c&amp;traceid=)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe founder Huaqiang Liang in the speech(fintech) have mentioned his own company in a video (\u8fde\u4f60\u8ba2\u6c34 [www.lianni.com](https://www.lianni.com),barreled water(claimed to be high grade)delivery service,whose meaning the funds have been invest in shareholder's companies.\n\n[https://www.657k.com/ss-%E5%B2%91%E6%BA%AA%E6%B1%87%E6%B4%8B%E6%A2%81%E5%8D%8E%E5%BC%BA/v-XMjc4ODI3MjIzMg==.html](https://www.657k.com/ss-%E5%B2%91%E6%BA%AA%E6%B1%87%E6%B4%8B%E6%A2%81%E5%8D%8E%E5%BC%BA/v-XMjc4ODI3MjIzMg==.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](qifa5rnn0sw21)\n\nPlatform withholds the funds for a year, even so, they are still advertising on portal site - \u8cb8\u7f85\u76e4 (Compass of Lending)\n\n[https://www.p2peye.com/thread-2233923-1-1.html?highlight=](https://www.p2peye.com/thread-2233923-1-1.html?highlight=)\n\n[https://ibb.co/7tqk33W](https://ibb.co/7tqk33W)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Hey, We are still working!\" Customer service staff replies that due to there is a bug in the system, so no funds can be paid .make fun of investors!\n\n[https://ibb.co/9cY0498](https://ibb.co/9cY0498)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCollection with Violent  - Moneypot (in the QQ official group, posted by Moneypot employees by after Platform withholds the funds)\n\n[https://ibb.co/jHS3f1n](https://ibb.co/jHS3f1n)\n\n[https://ibb.co/dL5sbtb](https://ibb.co/dL5sbtb)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![video](jk7dssyo0sw21)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![video](65zfd0ip0sw21)\n\nI was surprised.
