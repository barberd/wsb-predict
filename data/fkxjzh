It said commercial storage in Shandong ports\u2014which are connected by pipeline to Wuhan, the virus\u2019s epicenter\u2014are about 65% full, a record level. In that region, the number of barrels stored onshore has risen 18% to 142 million since the beginning of the year, said Geoffrey Craig, an analyst at satellite-data consultancy Ursa Space Systems.*\n\n[Source: WSJ - Ships Turn Into Floating Storage Units for Oil and Gas as Chinese Buyers Back Out](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ships-turn-into-floating-storage-units-for-oil-and-gas-as-chinese-buyers-back-out-11583339047)\n\nAs long as fuel demand remains low or the price war continues, both onshore and offshore storage facilities will be forced to raise prices in response to the increased global supply of crude. This has already begun.\n\n>*A flood of oil from Saudi Arabia and rival producers is expected to enter the market next month, adding to a surplus of oil that could overwhelm global storage. As markets struggle to find places to stockpile excess crude, \u201cthe prospect of single-figure prices\u2026is now pretty inevitable in the coming months,\u201d London-based consultancy FGE Energy said in a recent note.*  \n>  \n>*Some operators are increasingly turning to midsize oil transport ships, called Suezmaxes, to store oil.* ***But the costs have increased sixfold to $330,000 a day since the beginning of the month****, making such an option increasingly less attractive.*\n\n[Source: WSJ - Overloaded Storage Facilities Likely to Mean Even Lower Oil Prices](https://www.wsj.com/articles/overloaded-storage-facilities-likely-to-mean-even-lower-oil-prices-11584548816)\n\nWhen the metric fuckton of oil that Russia and SA have been producing tanker storage will become a sellers market and tanking/transport corporations will profit bigly.
