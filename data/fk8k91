Share prices jumped when this was announced March 2nd.\n\n**SINCE THEN**, Nokia has signed partnerships with Intel and Marvell to continue investing in their 5G infrastructure. It's looking like our man Pekka is prioritizing Nokia as an infrastructure company, and going after the big contracts. \n\nThis article points out the promising elements of Nokia's push for more 5g contracts - [https://www.lightreading.com/5g/ericsson-huawei-and-nokias-5g-wins-are-no-big-deal/a/d-id/757677](https://www.lightreading.com/5g/ericsson-huawei-and-nokias-5g-wins-are-no-big-deal/a/d-id/757677)\n\n>A far more useful measure would be a regular quarterly update on market share. Under pressure to scotch concern about its 5G competitiveness, Nokia included one in its last earnings report and promised updates in subsequent financials. In the fourth quarter of 2019, it claimed 27% of the 4G and 5G RAN market outside China, where its reluctance to be as transparent suggests it is struggling. While a number that includes the world's biggest mobile infrastructure market would obviously be even more helpful, neither Ericsson nor Huawei provides anything close. Nokia also indicated that it expects to maintain its 27% share outside China this year.  \n>  \n>A market share statistic is not the only new metric recently championed by the Finnish vendor. Henceforth, it has promised to show details of what it calls the \"weighted 5G win rate.\" The idea is to demonstrate its success at converting 4G customers to 5G and securing entirely new 5G business. A figure of 100% would imply contract numbers are unchanged: Either no customers have defected, or any losses have been offset by new deals. At the end of 2019, Nokia's win rate was more than 100% outside China and in the mid-90% range including China.\n\nThe fact that they are being more transparent than their rivals is a positive signal. A 100%+ win rate outside China means they are signing **NET NEW** contracts.\n\n**BUT WAIT -** they also just announced today they upgraded their IoT network to be on 5g - [https://venturebeat.com/2020/03/17/nokia-adds-5g-to-worldwide-iot-network-lets-carriers-test-new-sensors/](https://venturebeat.com/2020/03/17/nokia-adds-5g-to-worldwide-iot-network-lets-carriers-test-new-sensors/)\n\n**BUT WAIT EVEN MORE -** in the new James Bond movie, he will be using a Nokia phone - [https://www.gsmarena.com/screengrabs\\_from\\_new\\_bond\\_trailer\\_show\\_the\\_nokia\\_82\\_5g-news-41859.php](https://www.gsmarena.com/screengrabs_from_new_bond_trailer_show_the_nokia_82_5g-news-41859.php)\n\n**TL;DR Nokia is poised to solidify its position as a strong 5G vendor in 2020.** \n\n**NOK 1/15/21 $5c, $7c, $10c**", "created_utc": 1584463836.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fk8k91/nok_dd/", "is_self": true}
