I had some blood on my seat and I had to change my pants and shove some cotton up my ass. I thought I might have anal cancer, but it was worst. I checked my robinhood and it all made sense.  The common cold was spreading in China and I got ass fucked by SPY. Put credit spread got closed automatically that expired today by robinhood, so a big fuck you to RH for that.
