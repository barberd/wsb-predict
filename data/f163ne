I didn't even think about it. But, because of you fucking autistic gamblers, I'm free, I'm as clean as a toddler's butt before their uncle pays a visit. \n\nBecause or this subreddit I've realized there's so much more to life than My Little Pony, such as gambling. My life's a lot better now because of you guys. Thank you, from a former MLP addict, YOU guys helped me. I've already lost 6,000 dollars this week to gambling, cause I've seen people on this sub do it, I thought to myself why not. No more 4am My Little Pony marathons, only 4am money losing to gambling. I was such an addict, thank you, you fucking autistic pricks.", "created_utc": 1581237993, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f163ne/this_sub_helped_me_off_my_mlp_addiction_thank_you/", "is_self": true}
