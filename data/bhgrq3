{"id": "bhgrq3", "title": "The fiscal stimulus is going to lose its effect on the economy this year.", "selftext": "While it\u2019s potentially impressive for the U.S. economy to grow 2.4% in Q1 given the global slowdown, it\u2019s not that impressive if you include the effect of the fiscal stimulus. As you can see from the chart below, the effect of the fiscal stimulus is highest in Q4 2018 and Q1 2019. It is projected to help Q1 GDP growth by over 0.5%.\n\nThis effect is expected to wane to close to 0% by Q1 2020. Hopefully, the ECRI leading index is right about the economy having a cyclical upturn at the start of 2020 because it will need to, to prevent a drop off due to the stimulus\u2019 effect ending. Historically, we might look back at the timing of the fiscal stimulus as lucky because it helped prevent this slowdown from getting worse and turning into a recession. \n\n[Fiscal stimulus](https://i.imgur.com/e1Ftf5H.jpg)\n\n[US Fiscal Stimulus Declines While Stocks Rally](https://upfina.com/us-fiscal-stimulus-declines-while-stocks-rally/)", "created_utc": 1556243285, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bhgrq3/the_fiscal_stimulus_is_going_to_lose_its_effect/", "is_self": true}
