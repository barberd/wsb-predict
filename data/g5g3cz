Apparently TD\u2019s backend system is all fucky from yesterday\u2019s negative prices and their margin requirements for these futures and options is going through their system as N/A. \n\nThis scared the fuck out of me at first and honestly I don\u2019t know if having to trade like this for the time being is worth the potential returns from this play. This play is a huge gamble and I will be letting it ride hoping for a huge oversupply of oil again, but not being able to trade normally sucks. Anyone looking to make a similar trades, be aware of the drawbacks (aside from probably losing all your money on the trade itself lol)\n\nTD is aware of the issue and are working to fix it ASAP apparently. \n\nPs. I tried to buy the put last night at .30 and would currently be up like 400 percent but instead had to call and enter this morning for a much higher price. I thought this was a problem on my end but apparently it\u2019s on their end.", "created_utc": 1587478909.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5g3cz/a_warning_to_any_td_clients_trading_cl/", "is_self": true}
