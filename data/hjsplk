With 0 explanation. I'm trying to contact support, but I'm getting the whole (COVID response time-delayed) 3-5 days bullshit. Here's proof of my account value\n\nTo prove my account was $17k:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/65IeQb5](https://imgur.com/a/65IeQb5)\n\nIt's not exactly $17k, but this is the earliest pic of my balance.\n\nHere's the thing I DID initiate a transfer 2 days ago to TD Ameritrade, but not only was that 2 days ago I spoke to TD Ameritrade and they said they haven't heard anything on Robinhoods end?? I had 2-factor authentication and got no text message last night of someone requesting my code, so the possibility of being hacked isn't really there. I know I owed them $280 but I already deposited that to lift my prior restriction.\n\nI'm just scared I'm 20 years old and nearly $17k is just wiped from my account, with no explanation or prior notice. Robinhood doesn't even have a call center so I have to wait through this gut-wrenching week/ possibly weeks till I hear a response back. They better hurry, I got bills to pay for.\n\nIf anyone has had any experience like this please reach out...", "created_utc": 1593675542.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hjsplk/17k_completely_wiped_from_account_no_explaination/", "is_self": true}
