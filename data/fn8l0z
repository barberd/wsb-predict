{"id": "fn8l0z", "title": "A Market Liquidity Theory of the Current Financial Crisis", "selftext": "This is going to be a long post and analysis that I have written as much to get my thoughts in order as much to post on here for any feedback or criticism.\n\nEssentially, like many on here, I do not believe that the current situation is a temporary down-turn, but a full blown financial crisis. We have already been hit with the initial shock of this crisis, so the question becomes: what comes next? Helping us understand what is fundamentally happening in the market will aid in making intelligent future predictions and investments. That leads to the question: what exactly is happening in the market right now? What caused us to suddenly drive off a cliff? And is there any way we can save it? Unlikely many here, I do not believe that COVID-19 is the actual underlying crisis. In my opinion, our economy was basically the end stages of a Jenga game, and COVID-19 is just the swift breeze knocking the whole thing over.\n\nAs I started looking for the next big market move, I started to wonder who was going to feel the most pain in these markets. Some reading led me to the thought that what we were seeing in the markets was a liquidity issue, and that companies with poor credit ratings will be most affected. I posted about this a couple of days ago, and several others came to the same conclusion as me. [1](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flvrgr/bond_market_implosion_incoming_how_to_short/) [2](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmhz1p/the_great_unwinding_why_wsb_will_keep_losing/) [3](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhaofo/short_investment_grade_bonds_lqd_impending/). There are other obliviously other problems in the market at the moment, but this analysis will focus on this problem in particular.\n\nI now strongly believe that this hypothesis was correct, even if my initial reasoning and analysis was flawed. I outline a theory, followed by some supporting evidence, and finally some speculation. Finally, I don't think the Fed understands the actual problem the market is facing right now, nor does it have the tools to deal with it.\n\nThere are three prerequisites here: repos, collateral transformation, and rehypothecated collateral\n\n/u/Variation-Separate has already written an excellent technical analysis, and explains repos in part I. I will assume you have already read that section. [2](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmhz1p/the_great_unwinding_why_wsb_will_keep_losing/)\n\nThe basic idea behind collateral transforms is this: Your company needs some short-term liquid cash. In order for someone to give you this cash, you need collateral. You only have risky assets (such as junk bonds), but no one will accept them as collateral precisely because they are risky. Everyone in the market wants a secure asset (such as a Treasury). Instead of giving up, you go out and find someone who will loan you their Treasury and accept your junk bonds as collateral. You then use that Treasury to obtain the cash you need. This process can be repeated among many parties in order to create a \"collateral chain\".\n\nFinally, we have rehypothecated collateral: Someone comes to you and wants to borrow an assets for a short period of time (such as a stock). They give you another asset (such as cash) as collateral in exchange for the stock. You know the borrower won't be back to collect this collateral for a while, so you invest that collateral to make money off of it in the meantime.\n\nAs /u/Variation-Separate explains, there have been problems in the repo market recently, and the Fed has acted as the believe appropriate. However, this is not the first time the Fed has run into this problem . In fact, we had a problem a problem in the repo market just in Sept 2019 and [\"Not only did the spike in the repo rate come as a surprise to the New York Fed, but they also haven't been able to normalize it as quickly as they thought they could\"](https://www.pionline.com/markets/repo-blowup-was-fueled-big-banks-hedge-funds-bis). Finally, let's consider that even though the fed has offered to pump massive amounts of liquidity into the market, [banks aren't taking it and are quickly repaying that which they do take](https://www.newser.com/story/288474/the-fed-is-lending-1t-a-day.html).\n\nWhat exactly is going on then? The Fed tries to pump liquidity into the economy, and nothing happens. The reason for this is that the Fed knows that it doesn't understand the underlying problem in the market, and knows that is powerless to stop it. The Fed is trying to unleash every tool in its toolbox on the hope that if it just throws enough money into the market, *eventually* the problem will go away.\n\nSo what is the root problem? Essentially, liquidity. More specifically, collateral transformations and rehypothecated collateral. In fact, this has been written about extensively: [4](https://www.forbes.com/sites/caitlinlong/2019/09/25/the-real-story-of-the-repo-market-meltdown-and-what-it-means-for-bitcoin/#60f02f667caa) [5](https://alhambrapartners.com/2018/11/20/2018-the-collateral-case/), with Snider in particular making a strong case that today's crisis fits the analysis of the collateral markets that he provided in 2018: [6](https://alhambrapartners.com/2020/03/20/fire-jay-powell-immediately-the-overwhelming-proof-for-the-collateral-case/)\n\nHow are collateral transformations and rehypothecated collateral affecting liquidity in the markets? There are numerous ways, but let's start with 2:\n\nLet's say someone gives you cash as collateral, and you rehypothecate it as described in the example. However, instead of putting the cash in a safe asset, knowing you have to repay it, you put it in a very risky, high-yield asset such as a junk bond or MBS. Things go wrong, you lose your money and can't pay back your end of the repo. This is exactly what AIG did during the 2008 crisis. [7](https://www.realclearmarkets.com/articles/2018/07/27/in_capitalism_failure_isnt_rewarded_and_repeated_103366.html)\n\nNow let's say you engage in a long chain of collateral transformations. You start with a really risk assets, trade that for a sligtly less risky asset, trade that for a moderately risky asset, etc, until you eventually get a pristine asset. Now anyone along that chain can rehypothecate their collateral into some risky investment, causing a huge number of problems. Not to mention that if you, for some reason, can't fulfill your end of the repo, you screw a whole chain of people who have traded with you.\n\nNow, if we are in a strong market, these problems won't arise too often. But what happens if, say, a virus comes out of now where causing wide-spread economic disruptions? Now, maybe those risky investments that would have paid out more often than not aren't pay out at all, causing systemic problems.\n\nNow let's add a couple of things that exacerbate this problem even further:\n\nThese chains get so complicated that no one even knows who owns which assets anymore [4](https://www.forbes.com/sites/caitlinlong/2019/09/25/the-real-story-of-the-repo-market-meltdown-and-what-it-means-for-bitcoin/#60f02f667caa)\n\nWhen these chains collateral transformations start to fail, people may become less willing to take the risk of engaging in them [5](https://alhambrapartners.com/2018/11/20/2018-the-collateral-case/)\n\nAll of this caused heavy regulation on the exchange of collateral by primary lenders after the 2008 crisis. This has pushed these transactions into dark markets where we don't really understand what is going on. Here is my hypothesis, heavily taken from Snider's analysis:\n\nCorporations have become heavily reliant on short-term lending for liquidity. However, most of them don't have pristine assets to exchange for cash, or DisneyBucks to float them through hard times. So what to do? You engage in collateral transformations: keep exchanging your junk assets until you get the pristine assets you need to get liquid cash. A bunch of corporations do this over and over again, and eventually they really don't have a clear of idea of what assets they really own.\n\nFurther, in these collateral chains they are rehypothecating collateral to make a quick buck. All is well, until this virus comes along. Suddenly, corporations are losing their collateral in these risky investments. Further, they need cash. The first thing they do is try to transform their collateral for short term liquidity. However, a bunch of people have just lost their money playing this game and don't want to play anymore, so it becomes more difficult and expensive for the companies to engage in these collateral transformations. The assets they have are worth less, so they have to sell other assets to compensate. However, everyone is doing this at the same time, devaluing the assets. Devaluation of assets makes it even more expensive to engage in collateral exchanges, and the cycle continues. Finally, when these companies take account of their actual assets, after all of these complicated exchanges, they realize they don't actually own what they think they own, creating additional panic when they are already in crisis mode. This causes huge turmoil, and the markets fall off a cliff.\n\nIf this theory is correct, what will we see next? Whether the markets will go up or down is dependent on too many factors to predict. However, I do have some speculation. First let's categorize corporations as follows:\n\n**Type I: Safe**\n\nLarge banking institutions\n\nLarge P-1/A-1/F1+ Companies\n\nCompanies with huge cash reserves\n\n**Type II: Possibly Safe**\n\nSmall businesses\n\n\"Essential\" business (i.e., Boeing)\n\n**Type III: Doomed**\n\nBusiness with >500 employees, no large cash reserves, not P-1/A-1/F1+\n\nThe self-employed\n\nType I businesses will certainly weather the storm. If they don't have the direct support of the Fed, they have large cash reserves on hand. If they don't have large cash reserves on hand, they have the credit rating to make use of corporate paper. They can find the short term funding needed to make it through this.\n\nType II businesses may be safe depending on the government response. I am currently underwhelmed by the \"support\" for small business in the stimulus bill, but there seems to at least be talk about this so maybe things will change. \"Essential\" businesses may receive a bailout to get them through tough times.\n\nType III businesses are completely screwed, no one seems to know they are even there. They won't qualify for support as \"small businesses\", and they have no way of obtaining liquid assets in this market. In particular, the larger businesses don't have the pristine assets to obtain liquidity in these markets, they are dependent on collateral transforms.\n\nI won't predict whether the markets will go up or down this week, next, etc. But I will speculate this: I think the calm we saw in the markets was an actual calm. I think there was panic as businesses tried to obtain liquidity. They now believe they have the liquidity to make it through the near future, and are satisfied. There could be fire-sales in the near term for other reasons, but I don't think short-term liquidity will be the cause. However, most corporations don't speculate very hard when it comes to the future: they listen to the \"experts\". And these \"experts\" in government and the financials have been predicting doom and gloom for the next couple weeks, but that things will \"bounce back\" afterward. This is flatly false. As this becomes more apparent to these companies, I think we'll see another run on the market.\n\nParticularly, it will be the large Type III business that will be the most vulnerable. They won't have any government stimulus support, and they won't have access to their normal modes of obtain cash. The last panic in the markets pushed bond yields so high that issuing new bonds will be completely out of the question. For them, it will be like a game of chess where your 4 moves away from being mated no matter what you do. Many of them will decide that bankruptcy is the best option in front of them.\n\nCan the Fed prevent this? I don't think so. The Fed has the ability to soak up P-1/A-1/F1+, but they can only do this through the banks. But the banks aren't the ones in trouble this time, its the market itself. I have not read anything that leads me to believe that the Fed would be able to purchase junk assets from non- P-1/A-1/F1+ corporations without an act of Congress, and Congress is too slow and incompetent to see this problem coming or fix it in time. The Colosseum will be protected as Rome burns around it.\n\nSorry for any typos, poor wording.
