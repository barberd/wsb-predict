Just wondering what you fucking poor retards thought about my recent plays. I wrote 20 puts on ACB because why not, dilutive share practices should hurt me buying 2000 shares at a dollar cost average of 2.75 right? I also invest into 400 shares of YOLO, because some retard recommended it because it\u2019s actively managed, and i thought it sounded cool. Guys am i fucked or will the devils lettuce ever pay out for me, in it for about 10k total.", "created_utc": 1574810448, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e26ltn/time_to_buy_weed_companies/", "is_self": true}
