{"id": "fsqolv", "title": "WTF is up with APRN - opportunity or am I retarded?", "selftext": "So, APRN was on the verge of bankruptcy and trading at like $2, then on news of \"Hurr everyone is staying at home\", it skyrocketed to $24 and is now chilling at $12.\n\nIt's closest competitor only went up +80% (which is still insane, but sure - money wants to move). My completely adequate DD was that I've tried APRN and it seemed like a god damn waste of money because I could just order-in for that price, and if I knew how to cook I'd be buying my own groceries instead of paying +70% mark up. No way a bunch of unemployed people are going to start a APRN subscription (long $RICE and $BEANS).\n\nBeing the \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b I am, I sold some calls to take advantage of the upcoming volatility crush, and also bought some puts to form a synthetic short (since ToS didn't have any shares to lend me to short).\n\nA day later [some 'tard immediately exercised all my options](https://media2.giphy.com/media/G8ebH5TOE3pde/source.gif) thus assigning me and also forcing me to pay fucking commission to get him his shares (wtf m8).\n\nSo now I'm sitting here bagholding half of a synthetic short position, half actual shorts (which I don't even know the carrying cost for but yolo). Diamond hands somethingsomething this market better get rational faster than my upcoming insolvency hearing.\n\nPOS pos: 4/17 $4 P, short 4/17 $4C", "created_utc": 1585707509.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fsqolv/wtf_is_up_with_aprn_opportunity_or_am_i_retarded/", "is_self": true}
