Only way I\u2019m gonna learn is if I get punched in the mouth a few times and lose my last few brain cells.\n\nSaw some news about the Air Force plane getting shot down so I was like alright let me try trading the news. LMT, LHX, RTN.. I picked LMT.\n\nGot in when the price was like $433. Bought 10 weekly calls with a strike price of $445 (meant to do 1 contract but TDA distracts ReeRee\u2019s like me with their flashing green and red lights) So I was like alright cool I\u2019m in.\n\nPulled the trigger and P/L said I was up $30. Well I wanted to paint some green as I don\u2019t remember the last time I won a trade just to say I won my first options trade ever.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nThe P/L said I was up $30. Why the fucckkk when I sold did it say I lost $120?!? Did I have to wait until the price was $455 by Jan 31st to break even? \n\nOptions calculator dot com hoed me", "created_utc": 1580159788, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/euukio/why_did_i_lose_on_this_trade/", "is_self": true}
