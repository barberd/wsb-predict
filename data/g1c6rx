Bold headline to grab your attention**\n\nSome  generic garbage about well known investment theories over multiple  decades.  How are they relevant to a 2 week hail mary prediction?   They're not, but it gives the illusion I know what I'm talking about.\n\nHere is a [bullish article](https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/stonks-meme-boglehead-investing) that I'm sure no one will take the time to read, but due to mob mentality, bulls will instantly jerk off to it.  \n\n**II. Technical analysis**\n\nSpecific fortune telling miracle that proves astrology controls the stock market at this point. (Who cares about numbers, as long as they are green, which they all are!)  Doesn't matter if our drill pierces the heavens, stonks will keep going up!  No matter what you say, or what evidence you provide proving stonks fluctuate, bulls gonna charge.  \n\nAlso, I filled in some color pages within the lines.  \n\n**III. Some other useless garbage about other markets**\\*\n\nMention  commodities, including precious metals, perhaps treasuries to make  oneself seem knowledgeable.  More thoughts on what COULD happen versus  what will really happen.\n\n**TLDR:  this is a foolproof prediction that I saw on** [**fool.com**](https://fool.com) and **will gain me a cult following if  I'm right and I'll just try again on a new account if I'm wrong. God I  love reddit and this sub.**\n\nEdit:   The rally from below 2200 to present levels was perfectly predictable,  if you looked at fundamentals and technicals.  No fucking way I'll say  anything of the sort **BEFORE** the fact but I'm pretending to be a timeless sage in hindsight.  Also, up we go.  \n\nThese  are interesting levels that I'm keeping an eye on: 2500, 2700, 2950.   What does it mean and what tradeable insight are to be gained from these  numbers? lol fuck if I know.  Also there is a possibility of a rally to  2880 but I'm looking for an initial fall to 2760 this week perhaps  maybe.\n\nEdit 2: [Proof of incoming 4000.](https://imgur.com/a/NclXR10)", "created_utc": 1586892768.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1c6rx/the_great_expanse_why_sp_will_go_over_4000_within/", "is_self": true}
