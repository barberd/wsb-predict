{"id": "gn7b9r", "title": "Huya DD = We busted through all the MAs super rare Golden Retard mode unlocked tomorrow only", "selftext": "What a time to be alive.  We are probably busting through all the DMAs and stuff.  I don't totally understand them anyhow and in a way I bet a lot of those statistics are busted now because corona.\n\nTomorrow is a white swan event I'd like to call the \"Golden Retard\" We have a great company, moving up earnings, a hot IP, a weird market and lots of retail investor activity. Nearly 24 months of suppressed growth and we are standing on an army of bag holders that are currently sliding into my DM's with excitement. It will never get any better than this........ Get on board. The more waves we hit this thing with the more money we all make.\n\nInteresting Put Activity\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Who could it be?](https://preview.redd.it/6s733tjveuz41.png?width=576&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc9b8454db7c6686a5da44f6ecfd5870d598dd29)\n\nMaybe someone can shed some light?  Someone who already has shares? Trying to profit off of their attempt to trip up the weak hands?\n\nMaybe it's something else.  Just curious \n\n[Illustration of the Carnage](https://preview.redd.it/qawticl9huz41.png?width=1016&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f2cec573979e45bb2481fb6cf777841efdebdba)\n\nWe came out hard and started scrapping against the ceiling of the sell wall.  Sell ceiling IDK what the nomenclature is.  I like to imagine you are going through a tunnel with stalactites of stocks for sale.  As you get higher and higher tunneling up this cavern,  stalactites of red candles fall to the ground as you scrape them off the ceiling. \n\nI feel like most of those red candles on the ground came from limit sells set a long time ago.   The two big ones seem like they might have thought behind them.  IDK these are just my impressions.\n\nI'm guessing most of these shares were from sell limit orders set some time ago and we are just scrapping up the stragglers.  We went hard in the paint until about 2:30pm thats when whomever bought those puts dropped their load.  Their goal being to derail us or maybe shake up weak hands and buy back the options that are on their way to tendie town.  IDK maybe someone else has some thoughts or poke holes in mine.\n\nWe are standing on a mountain of bag holders. HAHAHAHAHA Lot's of them. They keep sliding into my DMs. EXCITED I appreciate it. Thank You for your service.\n\nLET'S GET THIS BREAD BROTHERS  \n\nThe weak hands are long gone.  All that is left is the true believers, the lazy and the set it and forget it types.  \n\nIDK how this thing is gonna play out but here are my thoughts. Our best move and our advantage is our energy and the power of the golden retard......\n\nThe goal of this DD is to forecast out the next trading day.  Beyond that it is going to be out of our hands as the cat will be out of the bag and bigger money is gonna have to get in if they want in or even can. hahahahaha         Let's talk money\n\n[I think a good illustration of the amplitude of our energy](https://preview.redd.it/a48mmf3xmuz41.png?width=1376&format=png&auto=webp&s=02602d965a021436ff3bb7a3277ee5cab5e1e29e)\n\nWe are pushing through resistance but that resistance is thin and weak.  We are also going to wake up old bag holders.  ALL YOU GUYS WHO DMed ME, Double down if you got the funds. I'll give my thoughts on where you should be in the TL/DR\n\nI want to beat the TWLO Gap up which has some similar characteristics.  They had really steep energy going into their earnings week.  Out energy isn't as big YET but we are getting similar strength from the army of bag holders we are standing on top of.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE\n\nI think the other thing TWLO had going for it was the people in the know who were in that space.  The kind of people who who knew about that early are the kind of guys who get paid fat stacks.  EARNERS \n\nThe bag holders DMng me are mostly video game dudes.  Some look to get paid so we might have an earner advantage baked in there.\n\nTWLO types are probably the high end of retail stock buyers.  Add in non retail money  that was waiting to see how earnings were and viola BIG GAP UP\n\nI believe the amount of available liquid shares will contribute to our ability to resurrect this stinger.\n\nThe mirror image of the amplitude I pointed to in the image above corresponds to a $32 stock price.\n\n[This is the way](https://preview.redd.it/c4mlf9yuyuz41.jpg?width=1009&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=49947db759a7a870469aa14babb3f28865abe0f3)\n\nWe can also go higher if more people join the gang. I was already thinking 32 before the obviously genius Mr329 gave his excellent analysis..... hahahahaha\n\nI think we should make $32 the goal with anything above $30 we are happy with and anything above $32 is C.R.E.A.M.\n\nWe are in a once in a lifetime position.\n\nTomorrow \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e's are on sale the more we get the more we all make.\n\nBefore I address the plan here are some bulletins.\n\n[FUD](https://preview.redd.it/nzv1dudctuz41.jpg?width=1073&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8c1e02c5fc4f0df810f79f80a68462e0cfe4a4d1)\n\nThis is called FUD.  It's pussy shit designed to shake pussies. The Senate \\*MAY\\* vote on something that \\*COULD\\* is all you need to know.  You should know this stuff.  What you shouldn't do is pay that much attention to it.\n\nThey COULD do a lot of things.  What they don't usually do like almost never is mess with the money and they only talk about it for show.  DON'T GET OFF TRACK.  DO NOT LOSE FOCUS.\n\nPart 2.  MARKET CAP.  What I believe is the situation is we are trying to gain access to 67 million shares of class A stock traded on the NYSE exchange.  I believe other parties own class B.  If someone can shed more light on this please do.  I am sure within 24 hours we can have an answer.  For the next 24 hours it is not important as I am skeptical that we will be able to carry the football far enough before we have to sit down and do the math.  EVEN IF WE DO CARRY THE FOOTBALL TOO FAR if you got in ANYWHERE yesterday and we create an overvalued situation by Thursday that's one of those things you call a good problem.\n\nThis shit is on sale.  We don't need to figure out the actual value and won't really even know until Wednesday night.  Right now all we need to operate under is all gas no brakes.  Just because we have the free space to work within to get to $32 doesn't mean we can do it.  \n\nRight now I am operating under the assumption that the 67million A's shares are 50% of the equity and further talk in this DD by me makes those assumptions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[One of many](https://preview.redd.it/bfndfvv51vz41.png?width=287&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0c685b0641beacfa4c13bd77b3aca3cc886594)\n\nLet's talk energy and velocity\n\nI emailed all my plays to my cousins and friends last week as I do on occasion and they like to follow sometimes.  Got two replies back this afternoon from a cousin and a friend.  Both had been watching today and were excited as they were already in.  Asked them what they bought and I commented to both of them I thought they'd go in more. Both said they were interested and wanted to see earnings before they went in more (\\*with bigger amounts\\*) I've also had that same sentiment expressed to me in DM's and posts.   We are in an awesome position.\n\n1. Standing on a mountain of bag holders\n2. Busted trough the weak and thin ceiling above us. \n3. We are already popping up on more of those velocity trader notifications AND we are gonna get randos that just buy whatever has earnings after market. \n4. Already have people that have planted a position and are waiting to plant more\n\nConcerns\n\n1. Whomever sold us all those options and or whomever tried to knock us off the horse yesterday. (If my assumptions on that are even right\n2. Sustaining and managing our bulldozer as we get these \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\n3.  I think the only resistance we are going to get is long programmed sell orders that we chew through as we move our way up. \n4. We might get hit with red dildos.  BUY THE FUCKING DIP RETARDS \n\nThe metric I am going to build around is volume. I'd like to see least 9.7 million in volume.  ANYTHING HIGHER IS GREAT.  I am setting the guidance to over $30 with a prediction of $32 and a grand slam at $47\n\nHOW DOES THAT HAPPEN?  Well it's very simple. We have one day to get those \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8ewe have an open market with which to rip in.  All we need is rippers. You want some\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e's it's simple. BUY TICKETS TO DIAMOND TOWN in the form of Huya Class A Shares.\n\nI see 3 plays\n\n\ud83d\udc8eis 10%= putting 10% of your portfolio in diamonds\n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e is 20% = putting 20% of your portfolio in diamonds\n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e is 30% = You should understand now.\n\nI'm level \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e.  I  know money when I see it and I'm the type of guy who would want to build my portfolio around 3 fat rocks. \n\nWe want any and all throughput outside of our purview but if we just keep buying up these diamonds all day long and keep this thing chugging steady THIS IS THE WAY\n\n# 1.Commit to a diamond level.\n\n50% of said level = spend as you want to. Opening bell, Dips, Lunch Hour, As you sell positions, dribble it out through the day. Doesn't matter.\n\n50% of said level = I'd  shake things up, spend around dips. I like Lunch hour. I'd just shake things up\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf this thing stays on the march until 2:30pm I'm confident that velocity and inertia will keep this thing going and even if it sags or dips we will have already won. The farther we keep this check mark going the more we all get paid.\n\nAll you got to do is buy some diamonds.  Once the world is paying attention price discovery will set things where they need to be.\n\nI'm building my whole portfolio around whatever I have and will not cash out much.  I might get a new to me truck I'm thinking a Tacoma and putting an Aluminum flatbed on it but you do you..  This thing is going to rocket over the next 7 months and two earnings periods and Q2 is going to crush Q1.  I'm holding for all that easy climb that Huya should have already had.  Sorry about those Trump tweets Huya.\n\nTL/DR\n\nToday we build the platform with which we will gap up from.\n\nPick your Gang Level\n\n10% \ud83d\udc8e20%\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e30%\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\n\nThis corresponds to the percentage of your portfolio you are putting in Huya.  \n\n50% of your diamond level you buy whenever you want. \n\n50% i'd mix things up and do something different than your normal patterns.\n\nGoal is 9.7 million shares of volume. ANYTHING MORE IS GREAT. Price Target over $30 but the sky is the limit. We don't want parabolas.  If things start to heat up back off. All of us should be in a position that we will get tendies. The goal is to maximize said tendies and build positions in this company for our portfolios. If you want to buy more that's welcome as well.  \n\nTELL FRIENDS, FAMILY, COWORKERS.  Spread the word.  The more people involved the better it is for all of us.  I don't know what sort of energy we can throw at this thing but we want to give it everything we have. Yesterday was the last day that Huya traded under some important line (Someone sent me the drawings)  We only go up from here.  Congrats on being lucky enough to get in at the end of this journey instead of a lot of my the bag holders who DMed me saying they were waiting for this day.\n\nTL/DR of the TL/DR\n\nToday Important = high stock price =sets baseline for price discovery after earnings. \n\nBuy shares retard and hold until Thursday or longer.  Do whats best for your portfolio. Sell said shares or sit on them. AMERICA\n\nI'm going to bed. All the other pertinent stuff we can figure out after we get this bread\n\nSPREAD THE WORD DO YOU PART\n\nTHIS IS THE WAY\n\nCommit to the cause below.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a5fn70zlivz41.jpg?width=680&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0664745144938dbec617c6429c33536dfad69110", "created_utc": 1589961946.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gn7b9r/huya_dd_we_busted_through_all_the_mas_super_rare/", "is_self": true}
