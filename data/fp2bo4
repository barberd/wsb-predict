My grandpa-in-law is 84 and we just got a call from his ER doc in MD that he is in military style lockdown and presumably won\u2019t make it through the night.\n\nImagine you get a call that someone you love is dead to rights and you cannot say goodbye.\n\nReally, stop and think about it.\n\nI\u2019ve just started my WSB journey in the end if feb and I\u2019m up a little over $25k. I\u2019d give literally all of it back to be able to hav my wife and I say goodbye, because this man is dead to rights.\n\nThere is a cost to everything. A lot of you won\u2019t understand it at all. Some of you will understand it when someone you love dies. It is entirely possible, especially now.\n\nJust don\u2019t fucking dance, whatever side of the line you\u2019re walking on:\n\nTl;dr: fuck you, SPY 185p 4/10, and fuck you, don\u2019t feel good about it you fucking pussies.", "created_utc": 1585184898.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fp2bo4/dont_fucking_dance/", "is_self": true}
