I got stuck in some dumb meeting and wasn\u2019t able to check for the last few hours of the market. It closed around $650. But then dropped to around 640 after hours. I had no idea what would happen, but it went through.  What do we think will happen Monday morning? Did I make a few extra bucks and be able to buy back without a loss, or is the rocket ship still going first thing? Maybe I sell puts below 647.5 and hope for a bit of pullback or flat until new news. But also short squeeze. Yell me what to do.", "created_utc": 1580615558, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/exih1c/did_i_get_lucky_or_will_i_have_regrets_monday/", "is_self": true}
