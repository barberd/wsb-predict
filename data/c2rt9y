{"id": "c2rt9y", "title": "Question about Futures Contracts", "selftext": "So I read somewhere that it is possible to take delivery of the underlying commodity of a futures contract, but that you will need to pay the exchange to store it for you if you do not sell it right away, yada yada yada. Anyways, my question is, is this true, and if it is does it only apply to some commodities, or everything? For instance, could I actually go collect my 250 pounds of uranium ( see [here](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/other/uranium_contract_specifications.html) ) from the CME, or is collecting something like that, shall we say, *frowned upon*?", "created_utc": 1561007152, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c2rt9y/question_about_futures_contracts/", "is_self": true}
