I did some research and found out that the fed can print on average about 10,000 $100 bills per second TOPS. \n\nSo if we take $6,000,000,000,000 and we divide that by $100, the 10,000 printed per a second, and we know that there are 31,557,600 seconds in a year, this gives us just about 19 years to get to $6 trillion.\n\nFor all you autists out there that\u2019s 2 BULL AND BEAR RUNS BEFORE THE FED CAN PRINT THE STIMULUS PACKAGE. \n\nAll I\u2019m saying is that we can\u2019t rely on this cash hitting pockets. \ud83d\udc3b\ud83c\udf08 SPY $69 p 4/20 is our best bet.", "created_utc": 1585113025.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/foknl4/the_only_time_i_will_ever_use_my_math_degree_for/", "is_self": true}
