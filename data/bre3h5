I Just wanted to self flagellate myself like the albino monk from the DaVinci Code today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I still own calls and the short rates are still climbing. Calling around I've found short borrow rates between 43% and 74% which is up from 37-54% yesterday and end of last week. IB told me they now have zero available shares to short. Short interest should be out by end of the month and \"earnings\" (if we can call them that) are out June 6th. Hence I own the August calls.
