{"id": "e4xvg5", "title": "COSTCO CHINA DD", "selftext": "Alright autists, \n\nSo when you guys were fighting with fat smelly slobs from the dregs of society at your local Wal Mart of Best Buy, I was spending Black Friday fighting vicious little grannies at the Costco in Shanghai (check the EXIF). This is a full album of 69 images of what I saw, but here are the deets. \n\n[https://imgur.com/a/RacVoIn](https://imgur.com/a/RacVoIn)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. It fucking looks like AMERICA. Go it, it's the exact same layout as every store in the ring of 6 Costcos around my house\n2. There were even Indians there. And you know how much Indians love good deals\n3. EVERYONE HAD A FULL CART. No car to carry it home? No problem, there was a direct bus line and it was packed with people hauling shit CHINESE STYLE\n4. The pizza. Oh my god the pizza. You don't know how SHIT pizza in China is. Even though I'll give them a pass on the Hawaiian and pineapples on pizza (actually FUCK YOU I LOVE PINEAPPLES ON PIZZA), the taste is exactly the same down to the feeling of the dough\n5. The supervisor is ASIAN AMERICAN from CALIFORNIA. He's pretty smart, and his badge said he started 2017. BUT HE'S ASIAN YO. HE'S LIKE IM YO QUANT MR. SAM COSTCO\n6. Yo the real important DD is this. The things are Costco are not cheap by US or Chinese standards. Costco in the US usually earns a 5-10% markup, but things in China are essentially double the cost of what they are in the US (look at the album). This can't be just due to import duties, because a lot of the goods sold are actually made in China. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, calls on COST, sell puts, do put credits. Whatever it is, COST is going to the moon.", "created_utc": 1575286605, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e4xvg5/costco_china_dd/", "is_self": true}
