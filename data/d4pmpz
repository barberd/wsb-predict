McDonald\u2019s has been flying high all of August and you can predict that they will easily recover back to $220 price within a month. My plan is to buy calls for October 25th two days after  release earnings (which McDonald\u2019s has been killing btw) and then I\u2019m gonna sell right before because McDonald\u2019s is huge everyone gets hyped before earnings and price usually soars with big companies before they release earnings. \n\nWhat do you think?", "created_utc": 1568577566, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d4pmpz/mcdonalds_dd/", "is_self": true}
