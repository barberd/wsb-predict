{"id": "g9na5t", "title": "Why $MTCH will be your next 1000% play", "selftext": "Everyone's trying to play earnings for Q1 and we've seen some great wins and losses so far. The problem is that people tend to buy calls on a stock that has a positive earnings report already priced in and end up losing. An example of a stock that had their ER already is [Dominos](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/dpz). Their price was going up slowly already up until a major sell off after their [very positive earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/dominos-pizza-earnings-q1-2020-dominos-stock/) report. An example of a stock that's currently going through this is [Twitter](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/twtr), as it's price has ramped up 15% in the last week already in anticipation and will most likely fall after earnings in two days (get puts btw). \n\nThe key is to find the 'golden egg' of earnings, a stock with earnings that are far enough out and not priced in yet. A company that has actually benefited from the covid19 lockdown in unexpected ways. Ideally, you want to buy calls on a stock that people in general *do not* think will go up, so that any beat earnings would not be priced in. And you'll want to get into this stock over a week before the report. Take [snapchat](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/snap) for example. Nobody expected it to go up after earnings, this is reflected in it's price a week before the earnings report, falling 10% between April 14th and April 21st. And then when earnings came, boom, 30% up and call holders profited. All of WSB was stunned. \n\nSo I made the call on Snap on the daily discussion thread before it mooned and now I'm here with my next call. Because the earnings graphic for May 4-8 isn't out yet, I made my own [rough one](https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g957ph/since_the_week_of_may_4th_to_8th_earnings_graphic/) on MS paint and scrolled through all of them to see what would be a good buy. And I think I found my golden egg. Match or MTCH is an online dating company with web sites serving over 50 countries. A lot of people think they're just match.com but they also own OkCupid, PlentyOfFish, Tinder, and Hinge. They pretty much have the monopoly on dating apps. With the covid19 lockdown happening in the states and around the world, people are on their devices trying to socially connect while maintaining physical distancing. *This* is why snapchat soared last week. We can look at statements from Chief Executive Officer Shar Dubey that mentioned clear \"increases in engagement\" among their platforms reporting an increase in the number of conversations that people are having, along with the length of these conversations, which are up anywhere from 10-30% since the outbreaks started in many countries.\n\nNote how I'm making this post a full week before MTCH's earnings on the 5th? I've noticed time and time again that it's always better to do an earnings play earlier rather than later because the price generally runs up beforehand. We're trying to buy in *before* the run up. MTCH is now trading at $78-79 down over 4% from yesterday's high of $82.60. This dip makes it *the perfect time* to buy as I don't think you'll get a better price before earnings next week. The pre-covid peak was $92, and remember, covid19 is *helping* the dating platforms, so I do expect a best case scenario of it getting back up to this value. That would mean a 15% increase. [I'm not into the meme lines, but here's some TA](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/MTCH/ycpr8F4h-Making-Love-Over-Video-Chat-Looks-Bullish/) for those who crave it. These indicate a strong buy signal for literally all of last week. \n\nIf that wasn't enough, Match has also changed it's platforms in the wake of the lockdown to make it more desirable. Just like how facebook introduced videochat, their website introduced 1:1 video chat. Match is also making dating advice more available to its users and launched a special \u201cDating while Distancing\u201d service that includes free access to dating experts. I'll be making another DD post on a completely different earnings play later this week. It's not as simple as printing out the sheet and throwing a dart at it. If you do your research, we'll all make tendies. :) \n\n**tldr;** MTCH 80c 5/15", "created_utc": 1588080884.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9na5t/why_mtch_will_be_your_next_1000_play/", "is_self": true}
