{"id": "go9fxv", "title": "Don't lose gains because of PDT", "selftext": "You have 2 options. Cash account = no PDT. PDT is only when trading on margin. Enough said there. Your second option is easy. Leg into a spread and lock in your gains. Ride out to expiration and you could make even more if it moves in your direction. Example\n\nDisney is trading at 100 dollars today (not really but using easy numbers). You decide to buy a Disney call for 105 strike for 1.55. Disney MOONS to 115. For easy numbers sake your Disney call is now worth 8.00 and the Disney 106 strike is worth 7.45. If you SELL a Disney 106 for 7.45 you just locked in $630 on your gains. If Disney continues to go up your 106 will get assigned, you will execute your 105 to cover it netting you 100 more dollars. So now you just made $730. If Disney drops to 0 after you open the spread you will still have your 7.45 you sold your call for.\n\nPDT does no restrict you from locking in gains. I open spreads sometimes to lock in 25 or 30 dollar gains and let them ride to protect my profit, and leave the potential for more.", "created_utc": 1590109250.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/go9fxv/dont_lose_gains_because_of_pdt/", "is_self": true}
