{"id": "fp9ff7", "title": "The Fall of Oil, and how YOU can make Tendies", "selftext": "Before I start, I'm not a trend-identifying veteran like other autists here. I simply see infer the price direction of a certain commodity when all sources tell me to think so. The certain commodity I'm referring to is **crude oil.**\n\nNow I don't know if you autists have been noticing lately but there's not much use for oil with the beer virus running rampant. Especially since we're all trapped in our wife's boyfriend's basement. Take a look at these nicely color-coded piecharts that even you can understand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[United States Oil Usage](https://preview.redd.it/7rlwhsimpzo41.jpg?width=220&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ab274715d783b13200dace37970b251d2c3fb2cd)\n\n[Consumption of Crude Oil by Country](https://preview.redd.it/c1df8xvzpzo41.png?width=455&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc39951446938d70a7c8e85c7c2aee9b77de03a3)\n\nYou know what happens when America is screwed, and Transportation is screwed? **Oil goes tits up.**\n\nNow add that to the fact that we already have commonplace news of a Saudi-Russian oil war and the talks falling through. After April 1st, well let's hear from Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak who said that **from April 1 neither OPEC nor non-OPEC countries have any restrictions on production.** [https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-saudi-oil-output/saudi-arabia-to-hike-oil-output-above-10-million-bpd-in-april-after-opec-deal-collapse-idUKKBN20V0B0](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-saudi-oil-output/saudi-arabia-to-hike-oil-output-above-10-million-bpd-in-april-after-opec-deal-collapse-idUKKBN20V0B0)\n\nI think you can get what he's hinting at here (oil armageddon). Saudi is ramping up production like invasive rabbits but sources say Russia can handle a price drop better than Saudi. There's also articles like this [https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonconstable/2020/03/24/oil-prices-could-plunge-to-10-a-barrel-swamp-storage-capacity-report-says/#3e8d6ef435ac](https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonconstable/2020/03/24/oil-prices-could-plunge-to-10-a-barrel-swamp-storage-capacity-report-says/#3e8d6ef435ac) that say oil will drop to $10.\n\nThere's a few ways you can profit off of this:\n\n**1. ETFS**\n\nBuy **$DWT (3x inv GSCI Crude index)**/short **$UWT (3x GSCI)**. These don't have options, but they aren't pussy either.\n\nWant to trade options?\n\nPuts on **$USO** and **$XLE.** This is riskier cause it's more affected by Donnie Pump but I can't imagine it going up over the next month.\n\n**2. Oil Stocks**\n\nIdk literally any oil company that can't support itself with less than $20 a barrel (everyone). Watch out for bailouts.\n\n**Tl;dr: Puts on OIL expiring late/April or Buy DWT**\n\n**Ex: $XOM 30p 5/1**\n\nIf I'm missing something and all of this is priced in please say something down below. I want to say this is a DD but with how volatile the market's been it can easily be a shitpost. Just be careful as always when trading this commodity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: UWT and DWT are closing sometime around April 3rd [https://www.etf.com/sections/features-and-news/bloodbath-leveraged-etfs?nopaging=1](https://www.etf.com/sections/features-and-news/bloodbath-leveraged-etfs?nopaging=1) So don't mess with those.", "created_utc": 1585219531.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fp9ff7/the_fall_of_oil_and_how_you_can_make_tendies/", "is_self": true}
