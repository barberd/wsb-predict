But more importantly, there\u2019s a severe disconnect between the markets and what I\u2019ll call the \u2018smart money\u2019.  Retail always gets euphoric and FOMO and even when the majority of people who are long KNOW this is ridiculous and temporary, they can\u2019t resist the FOMO, decide it doesn\u2019t have to make sense and just start pouring in.  Believing that \u2018the Fed\u2019 really can control the market, directly buy equity ETFS/stocks and prevent a crash.  They actually believe it\u2019s completely safe.  They have been trained repeatedly, over and over, to buy any and every dip in the markets.  So much so, that when IT really happens, they\u2019ll never believe it and start buying and chasing to average down.\n\nNow I\u2019ve said repeatedly for quite some time now, that I openly acknowledge we are without doubt in a bullish phase of this BEAR market bounce, and that I even have believed we could run up to the 3130ish area on the S&P.  We\u2019re getting close to all time highs on the Nasdaq that maybe it goes for new highs and S&P 3130?  But I believe these markets are on extremely thin ice and could cave at any point.  I believe the upside is limited and the downside is massive, which could come into play at any time...and most won\u2019t have time to get out or even think that they should!\n\nThis market is grinding up because of these retail buyers and day traders, not institutional buyers/sellers, just keep buying every week with their unemployment checks and stimulus checks and any money they can find.  that is why volume is relatively light, it only small time retail buyers pumping all their money into the fake markets so that the big players can rob them blind.  Why are there record amounts of money sitting in money market accounts?  Why does Warren Buffet not see anything worth buying?  Why is Mark Cuban and countless other filthy rich people sitting in cash?  Do you think a bunch of White Dog Trump pumpers know better than the financial elite and insiders?  Do you think they are worried that they are missing the boat?  We are at all time high valuations on stocks during one of the worst economic and social disasters in modern history with it being far from over and no idea how bad it will get", "created_utc": 1591115277.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gvah7b/an_interesting_title/", "is_self": true}
