{"id": "fadw8m", "title": "$LIT ETF?", "selftext": "Been trying to find some cheaper ETFs and came across the Global X Lithium &amp; Battery Tech ETF ($LIT) trading @ $28.55 as of now with some significant holdings in Tesla, Samsung, LG, Panasonic, etc. [https://www.zacks.com/funds/etf/LIT/holding](https://www.zacks.com/funds/etf/LIT/holding) It's 6 month low is \\~$22.5 and 6 month high is \\~$33.5, so I think that there might be some reasonable room for further drop. \n\nTSLA's been dropping like a rock, and the ETF has a lot of exposure to Asian stocks where Corona's hitting hardest. My hunch is battery stocks might be pretty affected by this, especially if it hits pandemic classification.
