We post a lot of yolos around here which is great and all but we don't really have much in terms of track records besides the yearly leaderboard thread. By tracking our trades we can give people reputation scores and learn who's really killing it. Initially the bot will be limited to $1000 a week so everyone starts off on the same foot. \n\nThe options chain data it uses is from a free api right now so it's delayed by an hour or so I think.
