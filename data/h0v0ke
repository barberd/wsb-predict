To quote my hero, *\"I'm not trying to make friends, just trying to make some money\"*   \n   \nThis past week I've observed the protestors and instagram woke blokes start to sing a new tune when it comes to social change: defund the police. It seems like Biden and the other slimy centrists are halfway embracing the idea. With the vote happening in Minneapolis to fully defund their police department there's enough momentum politically. I have been watching how FOX news has been covering this topic (fear mongering + strawman arguments) and I'm convinced that *WHITE AMERICA* is scared shitless.

Therefore my assumption is bullish.   \n   \nLooking at the FBI data for gun checks in 2020- there's a clear upward trajectory this year and 2016-2019 featured 100m new legal gun owners. Lots of new people shopping for a pistol, the cheapest and easiest.     \n\nMy closing statement is simple: we all already know guns are going nowhere in American society.    \n      \n      \n**TL;DR**    SWBI 18c 6/19", "created_utc": 1591863136.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h0v0ke/swbi_dd_be_a_bad_person/", "is_self": true}
