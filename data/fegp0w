It is confirmed once the asset's price falls below a support level\u00a0 equal to the low between the two prior highs.\n\nDo you think that with today's numbers, we might be facing a double top on SP500 and therefore be headed to a much bigger fall?", "created_utc": 1583515132, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fegp0w/double_top_on_sp500/", "is_self": true}
