AYX - You need to be buying May calls, last week if possible.\n\n**What do they do? Why should I buy them?**\n\nFuck you, you're some idiot on reddit, you don't understand their business model and you don't need to to buy calls and it has never stopped you before. They are B2B SaaS. They sell data analytics software that is easy to implement for anyone. Very cool. (Mark my words they will out earn ZM and they are a fraction of the Market Cap right now).\n\n**Why now? What do you know that everyone else doesn't?**\n\nYou're already late to the party, they didn't revise earnings and that silence spoke volumes. They are way up this week. You already missed the boat.\n\n**What is the point of this post then?**\n\nWhat they didn't price in was that they will beat earnings. By a lot.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AYX/analysis/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AYX/analysis/)\n\nThe \"high\" is a 6 cent per share loss. This is lunacy.\n\n**Why are the analysts full of shit?**\n\nThe analysts are not full of shit. They are just glossing over how a general reduction of business will impact the earnings based on revenue recognition standards (especially after ASC 842 was adopted).\n\nTheir revenue growth is in hyperdrive growth, whatever, doesn't even especially matter either. What matters is that they are a subscription based revenue model, their revenue isn't project based, or even sales. It's people paying for Licenses. They have a 140% revenue retention rate. People not only renew year after year, they buy more. They buy more because they can replace old (very expensive and senior) IT personnel with desks with these tools and lower paid scrub to do the same work.\n\n**What's the bottom line?**\n\nQ4 EPS = .64 cents a share (beat analysts .29).\n\nQ1 proj (high) EPS = -.06\n\nThe reporting will be as **March 31, 2020 when earnings are announced in early May.** The argument that from the beginning of the panic (late Feb) that somehow customers that have been happy enough to year after year increase subscriptions for AYX software support then to suddenly cancel (and therefore halt revenue) for data infrastructure to slice a solid 100MM of revenue in that timeframe is just crazy. Honestly, if would be surprised if revenue didn't at least stay flat as of reporting for Q1 2020 ---> Q4 2019. Budgets don't get trimmed that quickly for data support. Not for Alteryx's customers.\n\nYou can either believe the analysts that somehow a ton of companies decided to cancel their data analytics suites in a month fast enough to also cut into the Q1 growth that had probably been underway (Q1 is when company budgets are approved, this is when new vendors often get to start providing services and therefore can begin to collect revenue).  Or that they will beat what is quite honestly low \"expert\" predictions that will likely drive them beyond their previous highs given how the implication would be that their business model can still grow in this environment.\n\nNow Past Q1? Who knows. But yeah May call on AYX, FDs probably shouldn't extend past 150.\n\nEdit: 5/15  150C  - 5/15 120C - Need to offload SPY 6/15 279P to buy more AYX Calls but I still believe in my lil guy.\n\nEDIT 2: missed a decimal up there (fairly significant one) - 0.06 EPS. Regardless, I expect them to beat the earnings by a lot, I just don't see them posting a loss with their margins as they stand.", "created_utc": 1586829168.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0wkff/alteryx_inc_this_is_some_pretty_guaranteed_money/", "is_self": true}
