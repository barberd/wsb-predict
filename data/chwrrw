{"id": "chwrrw", "title": "Tickers to look out for: $BABA, $CRM, $VAR", "selftext": "Instead of throwing your money way on FDs maybe think longer term and invest in these companies. \n\nAlibaba($BABA): I know there is a massive trade war going on and bla bla bla. But amongst all the shitty Chinese companies, the one with the most potential is this one. It\u2019s kinda undervalued at this moment and trading way below the lowest Analyst estimates. They ARE the Chinese e-commerce company. The market is massive there and they are also expanding to other countries. They also have a sorta successful cloud business. Knowing the Chinese government, they\u2019ll make it very hard for Amazon and Microsoft to succeed in the cloud business there. If I\u2019m not mistaken they also own a massive stake in the Alipay company. Their earnings are coming out pretty soon. Maybe play the hype or go long term. \n\nSalesforce($CRM): This company has been punished for too long for buying Tableau in a sort of bloated price. But they\u2019re still doing pretty well. They are the leaders in their business and trading well below the analyst estimates. They also recently expanded in China partnering with, well, Alibaba. I feel like there is a long term potential in the company. And so far they barely have any Chinese exposure, if you are afraid of the trade war shit. \n\n\nVarian($VAR): Came our with their earnings yesterday and the stock tanked afterwards. They grew in almost all categories and beat the estimates. So I guess it was because of profit taking by long term investors who invested around the December lows. They are the number one radiation oncology machine provider in the US and expanding to developing economies. It\u2019s a safe bet for long term and probably for short term too. Cancer is not going anywhere especially in developing countries like China and there is a lot of potential there.", "created_utc": 1564106246, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/chwrrw/tickers_to_look_out_for_baba_crm_var/", "is_self": true}
