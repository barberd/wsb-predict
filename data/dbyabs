{"id": "dbyabs", "title": "Options market 10/1/19", "selftext": "Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research\n\nToday\u2019s Bullish Activity\n\nMoving higher this morning is McCormick &amp; Company Inc. (MKC + $11.38 to $167.68) after the spice maker reported Q3 earnings of $1.46 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.17 beat) on revenue that rose 0.8% year-over-year to $1.33B (below the $1.34B expected). The company raised full-year 2019 EPS guidance to a range of $5.30-5.35 (from a prior view of $5.20-5.30B), which the company is attributing to a projected adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 20%. Calls are slightly outnumbering puts with the October 18th 170.00 call being the most actively traded contract (volume is 995).   \n\nAlso trading to the upside is ULTA Beauty Inc. (ULTA + $13.30 to $263.95) following news that global superstar and fashion icon Jennifer Lopez will launch her new perfume (Promise) exclusively at ULTA salons in the United States. Shares of ULTA are trading at a one-month high this morning. Calls are outnumbering puts roughly 2:1 with the October 4th 270.00 call topping the most actives list (volume is 2,035).\n\nLastly, several stocks are trading to the upside on analyst upgrades/price target increases:\n\nAcadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ACAD + $0.98 to $36.97): RBC Capital Markets initiated coverage on the biopharmaceutical company with an \u201cOutperform\u201d rating and put a $60.00 price target on the stock; calls are outnumbering puts roughly 5:2 with the December 20th 50.00 call seeing the most action from traders (volume is 250).  \nAnalog Devices Inc. (ADI + $1.11 to $112.84): KeyBanc Capital Markets upgraded the chipmaker to \u201cOverweight\u201d from \u201cSector-Weight\u201d and put a $130.00 price target on the stock; calls are outnumbering puts roughly 3:2 but the January 2020 95.00 put is the most actively traded contract (volume is 287).\nNational Vision Holdings Inc. (EYE + $0.71 to $24.79): Bank of America/Merrill Lynch upgraded the optical retailer to \u201cBuy\u201d from \u201cNeutral\u201d; option volume is relatively light with the January 2020 20.00 call being the most actively traded contract (volume is 6).  \nVMware Inc. (VMW + $3.96 to $154.02): Wells Fargo upgraded the enterprise software maker to \u201cOutperform\u201d from \u201cMarket Perform\u201d and hiked their price target to $180.00 from $140.00, citing optimism over the release of VMware Tanzu along with benefits of recent acquisitions (Bitname, Heptio and Pivotal Software); call volume is dominating (~8:1 over puts) with the October 11th 152.50 call being the most actively traded contract (volume is 1,717).\n \n\nNew 52-week highs (57 new highs today): Asbury Automotive Group Inc. (ABG - $0.49 to $101.84), Jack-In-The-Box Inc. (JACK + $1.11 to $92.23), Proofpoint Inc. (PFPT + $2.91 to $131.96), Ross Stores Inc. (ROST + $0.74 to $110.59)\n\nNotable Call Activity\n\nSome unusual call activity (~7:1 over puts) is being seen in Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI - $0.28 to $52.64) as all of the top 10 most actively traded contracts are calls. Option traders were primarily targeting the October 11th 55.00 call as volume is 19,630 versus open interest of 251, so we know that this primarily represents new positioning. The bulk of the activity on this contract consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought at the ask price of $0.47, including a 3,800 block that was bought at the ask price of $0.47, which suggests bullish intent. Note: Earlier this morning Activision announced that Call of Duty: Mobile is now available in all countries and regions where Google Play and App Store are supported with the exception of Mainland China, Vietnam, and Belgium.   \n\nMasco Corp. (MAS + $0.70 to $42.38): Calls are outpacing puts roughly 16:1 which is primarily being driven by activity on the October 18th 44.00 call. Volume on this contract is 5,192 (vs. open interest of 1,490) which mostly consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought at the ask price of $0.55, including a 2,500 block that was bought at the ask price of $0.55 (suggesting bullish intent).  \n\nToday\u2019s Bearish Activity \n\nMoving lower this morning is McDonald\u2019s Corp. (MCD - $5.44 to $209.27) after J.P. Morgan analyst John Ivankoe lowered his third quarter comparable same-store sales expectation to up 5% from up 6% (vs. the +5.5% consensus estimate). However, Ivankoe reiterated his \u201cOverweight\u201d rating and $230.00 price target on the stock and acknowledged the company\u2019s \u201cotherwise solid underlying fundamentals\u201d. Calls and puts are trading roughly even with the October 4th 207.50 put seeing the most action from traders (volume is 1,039).\n\nAlso trading to the downside is Canadian National Railway Inc. (CNI - $2.16 to $87.70) after Stephens downgraded the Canadian railroad operator to \u201cEqual-Weight\u201d and lowered their price target to $97.00 from $100.00. Stephens\u2019 analyst Justin Long cited recent volume underperformance, a \u201ctough\u201d Q4 volume comparison and a more mature model that could make significant cost cuts more difficult. Today\u2019s ~2.5% drop puts CNI below its 200-day Simple Moving Average (currently $88.60) for the first time since February. Puts are outnumbering calls nearly 2:1 with the January 2020 80.00 put leading the way (volume is 50).    \n\n \n\nNew 52-week lows (47 new lows today): Biomarin Pharmaceuticals Inc. (BMRN - $1.47 to $65.93), Canopy Growth Corp. (CGC - $0.97 to $21.96), E-Trade Financial Corp. (ETFC - $7.77 to $35.91), TD Ameritrade Inc. (AMTD - $10.05 to $36.65)\n\nNotable Put Activity\n\nSome unusual put activity (~8:1 over calls) is being seen in the SPDR Select Sector Utilities ETF (XLU - $0.34 to $64.40) which is primarily being driven by some block activity out on the December 20th expiration:\n\n61.00 put (open interest is 21,525) \u2013 A15K block was bought for $0.76 and (separately) a 4,910 block was bought at the ask price of $0.72\n58.00 put (open interest is 5,344) \u2013 A15K block was sold at the bid price of $0.35 and (separately) a 4,910 block was sold at the bid price of $0.33\nThe two blocks on each contract (15K &amp; 4,910) were coded as spread trades, but we don\u2019t know whether this was a roll-up (from the 58.00 to the 61.00 strike price) or a 61.00/58.00 bear put spread(s).\n\nVipshop Holdings Ltd. (VIPS + $0.01 to $8.93): Puts are outpacing calls ~18:1 which is primarily being driven by a 20K block that was bought at the ask price of $0.30 (open interest is 45,071). It\u2019s likely that this is a new position given the open interest figure but we can\u2019t be sure given the open interest figure.\n\nVolume Signals     \n\nApple Inc. (AAPL + $1.55 to $225.50): Apple is no stranger to heavy option volume but 3 out of the top 4 most actively traded option contracts across the board today are AAPL calls that expire at the end of this week as the stock makes a push towards all-time highs (intraday high today is $228.22 vs. all-time high of $233.47):\n\n232.50 call \u2013 option volume is 49,653 vs. open interest of 4,463\n230.00 call \u2013 option volume is 40,019 vs. open interest of 15,190\n227.50 call \u2013 option volume is 34,619 vs. open interest of 16,401\nHalliburton Company (HAL - $0.17 to $18.68): Option volume is running at roughly 5x the daily average of 11,342 contracts which is primarily being driven by activity on the November 15th 20.00 call (the #1 most actively traded option contract on the board today). Volume on this contract is 55,327 versus open interest of 7,684, so we know that this primarily represents new positioning. The majority of the activity on this contract consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought at various times at the ask prices of $0.83, $0.84 and $0.85 which suggests bullish intent.\n\nPG&amp;E Corp. (PCG - $0.06 to $9.94): A 6,725 block was bought on the October 18th 11.00 call at the ask price of $0.72 (open interest of 770). We know this block is a new position given the open interest figure and we can assume the intent is bullish in nature since the trade took place at the ask price.\n\nGauging Volatility\n\nThe CBOE Volatility Index (VIX + 1.65 to 17.89) has been on both sides of the unchanged line today (intraday range is 15.79-18.38) as equity markets are firmly lower around the mid-day mark today (DJI - 260, SPX - 25, COMPX - 54). VIX option volume has been tepid today at 156,502 contracts (#8 on the top 10 most actives list) and the activity has been call-biased (the volume put/call ratio is currently 0.60). The most actively traded contract is the October 16th 20.00 call as volume is 13,245 versus open interest of 159,708.", "created_utc": 1569957616, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dbyabs/options_market_10119/", "is_self": true}
