{"id": "e4o2vo", "title": "How to MAXIMISE tendies this upcoming tax season.", "selftext": "Alright boys I made a post a couple months back about this but in autist theory but I have now done actual research about how you can get possible free tendies from your taxes. \n\nThis is the basic idea if you are within 3000$ of a lower tax bracket this is for you. You can lose that 3000$ and write it off on your taxes as capital losses and it will move you to a lower tax bracket and that 3000$ was basicly a free yolo. \n\nHere\u2019s an example Let\u2019s say you are poor student autist like me and make 14,000$ this year the cutoff not to pay 1400$ in the 10% tax bracket is 12,000. INSTEAD OF PAYING YOUR HARD EARNED TENDIES TO THE GOVERNMENT you simply yolo 2,000$ on FDs. \n\nNow you\u2019ve got two scenarios, the more likely one is that you being the autist that you are lose it all but instead of losing 2000$ you write that sucker off on ur taxes and since ur income is now only 12000$ you don\u2019t pay that higher tax bracket and that 2000$ yolo was only 600$.   But let\u2019s say you\u2019ve been watching all of haupts fantastic dd posts, blocked and dodged gay mods posts and made the yolo and that 2000$ turns to 10k well free tendies bois u give your 10% of now 22000$ to the government and walk away with optimized tendies. This cannot go tits up and as always up free shkreli and mods are gay.\n\nTldr: get free money by yoloing your taxes", "created_utc": 1575235728, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e4o2vo/how_to_maximise_tendies_this_upcoming_tax_season/", "is_self": true}
