No help from r/options, so bringing it to the bad-boys of the street.", "selftext": "First, as a disclaimer, I am very much autistic- the first time I demonstrated this was by losing $2k in a couple of hours due to not actually even knowing what an option is. The second time, I had all my assets liquidated at shit prices because of a margin call caused by a transfer my bank blocked (another concept I didn't understand, as I wasn't using 'real' margin).\n\nAnyway, my real question which may SEEM to be a ban-worthy, obnoxious risk aversion is the following: I had recently sold an AMD iron butterfly, but as AMD began inching towards my lower breakeven at alarming speeds, I decided to 'condorize' the butterfly, by closing and reopening the lower leg in a single RH transaction at a pair of lower strikes. This was a net debit, so while my position was immediately 'profitable' after the adjustment, my feeling was that I should subtract the cost of the adjustment from any profitability ultimately realized from the butterfly-hybrid. Does this strategy make sense? When should it be used? What are the implications on probability of profit/risk/etc. Thanks, and also please let me know if anyone has the date when the market will crash - I have a brilliant play with puts in mind that I'll trade for all your TSLA shares (do people even buy stock here?).", "created_utc": 1561261334, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c3yqij/condorizing_an_iron_butterfly_is_this_even_a/", "is_self": true}
