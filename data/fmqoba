We all think this beer virus is causing the market to crash, but remember when people were saying \"recession\" like 2 months ago?\n\nYes, beer virus is black swan.  This is a recession, but not the one we expected.  BUT, beer virus isn't the only thing making this market dive.  There other things market investors are still worried about and one of them is oil (pretty sure USA is biggest producer of crude oil over Russia and Saudi Arabia).\n\nMy Prediction:\n\nOil prices jump Monday (I looked at like one chart and saw that the drop Friday didn't take out the lows from earlier this week) and that will cause the market to have an unexpected lil dead cat bounce for oil.  The market will follow and the market will be green Monday before continuing to e fall the rest of the week.  \n\nWhy am I confident in my prediction?  Because I was fucking stupid enough to buy apple calls during their stupid fucking slide EOD Friday.   I'm currently all in AAPL $260c 3/27.  Fuck me.  I'm simply trying to give myself just a little hope so that I can sleep at night (on the couch while Chad fucks my wife).", "created_utc": 1584837886.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmqoba/lets_talk_about_oil/", "is_self": true}
