There are death crosses.. evening stars.. fucking doji's and 2 bearish medium sized hyper mauve candles to the left of the right sun god along with JPOW's left nut hanging from a lamppost near the Canal.. but what **NO ONE** is taking into account is the fact that the printers have a 3 day rest period this weekend..  They will be raring to go come Monday and will be vigorously pumping by 7AM EST with pent up green goo coursing through their turbines..
