{"id": "fesyc9", "title": "OPK to be the next IVO?", "selftext": "OPKO Health inc. on March 5th announced that next week they will offer COVID-19 test kits and have been working with the HHS, CDC, and FDA to make, \"testing available as soon as possible.\" \n\nOn top of this, BioReference Laboratories, a company of OPKO, has an article speaking of how on March 4th V.P. Mike Pence and members of the White House\u2019s Coronavirus Task Force held a meeting to discuss the coronavirus outbreak and among the people attending the meeting was BioReference\u2019s Executive Chairman, Jon R. Cohen, M.D. \n\nThe stock the past 5 years has been on a steady decline with a sharp starting March 3rd but has since been hesitant to increase again so drastically.\n\nThough when it comes to the financials of the company things don't look as great as I feel they should. In the 4th quarter of 2019, they suffered a net loss accompanied by increased overall expenses. BUT to add to the COVID-19 test kit hype, they also have a net increase of total prescriptions as well as plans to release data concerning a growth hormone treatment on March 28th.\n\nAre these signs of a potential win? What are all of your thoughts?\n\nSide Note: Phil Frost, the CEO and Chairman of PHKO is also on the board of directors of Cocrystal Pharma, a company that has received patent rights from the Kansas State University Research Foundation to push into preclinical development for their Coronavirus program. Is this a win as well?\n\n \n\n [OPKO Health's BioReference Laboratories to Introduce Coronavirus Disease](https://www.opko.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/378/opko-healths-bioreference-laboratories-to-introduce) \n\n [BioReference Laboratories Article on COVID-19](https://www.bioreference.com/physicians/coronavirus/) \n\n [OPKO Health Reports 2019 Fourth Quarter Business Highlights and Financial Results](https://www.opko.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/377/opko-health-reports-2019-fourth-quarter-business-highlights)", "created_utc": 1583573422.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fesyc9/opk_to_be_the_next_ivo/", "is_self": true}
