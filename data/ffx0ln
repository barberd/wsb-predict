I mean, this is some crazy shit today, right?  Can we really go that much lower, and if so, how?  Lemme tell you.\n\nGod is going to punish America for our hubris.  \n\nThe first drop came when no one took corona seriously and pushed the market to an ATH.  That was just the greedy, stupid money disappearing.  Now we've realized that this shit is serious, and that the world economy is already fucked.  Okay, but here in the USA we're still good right?  So maybe the market hangs here for a few days, the S&P even sniffs $2,950 again, but that wholeee time corona has been spreading here for weeks.  We haven't learned from China, who had to shut down an 11 million person city to stop the spread of the virus.  We didn't learn from Italy, even though after a spiraling death rate they saw shutting down 16 million people as the best option available to them.  Instead, our leader, a man with the complexion and brain of a cheesepuff, is tweeting out comparisons to the flu's effect, an illness we know, understand, and can effectively treat.  The virus is spreading, and when we see our infection curve go exponential, multiple major population centers across the country will be dealing with overwhelmed healthcare systems and shuttered businesses.  \n\nGet ready for this shit.", "created_utc": 1583770220.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffx0ln/how_to_join_me_in_gainzville/", "is_self": true}
