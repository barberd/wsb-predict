{"id": "hircxs", "title": "Former bear accepts bullish evidence and buys fuck-ton of calls", "selftext": "I've been bearish for a long time, and I still am in the super long-term because I think there must be an insolvency crisis down the line. However, I think SPY will be at 420 by end of summer. Below are some of the main bullish points of evidence:\n\n1. Although the fed has slowed their rate of printing, there is still (and will continue to be) lots of liquidity in the bond/equity market. A hard sell off would face lots of resistance, so don't expect a big crash anytime soon, and then the following day expect the perma-bulls to buy up everything on sale.\n\n2. All the printing brought asset price inflation (rather than CPI inflation), so stock prices will continue to increase.\n\n3. Government bought a lot of corporate bonds, so their valuations should be higher than it is currently.  PE ratio and other formal equity valuation techniques don't mean shit anymore because of this reason. Instead, we need to take an earnings yield perspective on companies and compare them to real (10yr) bond yields, which currently suggests stock prices should be higher. \n\n4. As for unemployment, the ratio of temporary unemployed to permanent unemployed is 9. Most of the unemployed will get their jobs back, and in the meanwhile they still have government supported income so consumer confidence is still high... aka when we reopen people will spend their money... most likely.\n\n5. Banks got a bunch of money from gov as part of stimulus, they are indeed investing that money back into real economy (by giving people loans for businesses/mortgages/auto loans...). People originally thought that they are trying to avoid lending due to the risky environment, but that's not true. So the money multiplier is in action and the banks should eventually be able to pay back the government. This point is really important.\n\n6. This situation is nothing like anything we've seen in history for a number of reasons. So trading it like \"well in 1930s the rally went on for 6 months before the crash blah blah\" is a very quick way to lose all your money. This situation is unprecedented.\n\n7. It's election year, gov will go HAM with stimulus all summer long. Even if there's a second wave/another lock-down in some parts of US etc., I think we would STILL see asset prices be inflated.\n\nAnother note is that this market does not give a fuck about bad news. Today Fauci said we could see 100k new cases/day at this rate, and it barely moved markets... probably because investors know that the fed will keep printing and force up the stock market to the moon. On the other hand, when there's good news investors cum all over their BT and smash the buy button.\n\nI gathered this evidence from the GOAT Juliette Declercq \n\nTL;DR : SPY 395c 9/18", "created_utc": 1593536631.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hircxs/former_bear_accepts_bullish_evidence_and_buys/", "is_self": true}
