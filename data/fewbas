Consumers are panicking and literally emptying shelves of goods. Almost Every thread on WSB and Coronavirus are about people stocking up on canned goods, toilet paper, bleach, etc. this reminds me of a country going to war... people pull forward their spending in preparation for a shortage. But what if the shortage doesn\u2019t come? What if China is already going back to work? Conversely, what if a shortage DOES come? Prices rise and companies make more product. In my mind this might be a win/win for consumer retail stocks like Amazon/Costco/WMT. Costco\u2019s comps were up double digits for the first time in years. Amazon is sold out of a ton of items, WMT is the same way. \n\nFed just cut 50 bps. VIX is at 50, highest level since depths of financial crisis, stimulus is on the way, bond futures up above 4% in one day, which only happened in March 2009, after crash in 1987 and Oct 1982- all huge bottoms in stocks. \n\nIn South Korea, fatality rate is 0.6% because they actually are testing people- so essentially a bad version of the flu, but not world ending. Vaccine being developed, clinical trials for drug treatment by GILD going well... \n\nAnd the people that are perishing (unfortunate and terribly sad) are the elderly- which could ease up city and state pension obligations. (I know- a terrible thought- but my job is to analyze what might happen). \n\nI\u2019m actually really bullish after laying out my thoughts in this post.
