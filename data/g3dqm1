I heard that they are run by a bald wizard and are already up hundreds of dollars since you should be making this play,\" but then my other self was like \"Yeah but have you gone a single day in the last 60 days without making a retarded options purchase?\" And then my other self was like \"You're right, considering that I bought an additional 200 Spy puts at $245 that expire today for no reason.\"\n\nAfter about an hour of this I woke up on the floor and saw that I had already purchased 2 Amazon calls but unlike all my other stupid plays they dont expire to...get this...OCTOBER 16th so less stupid than usual. I am already up .04% or $10, but if my past performance is indicative of my future performance STAY AWAY FROM AMAZON. For all that is holy and unholy, who would sit by and watch Amazon go up day after day to all time highs so fast that Jeff Bezos traveled back through time only to buy calls as the steam starts to run out? This guy, that's who. Don't be me or one of my selves. \n\npositions: AMZN $2700 10/6 for $24.8k", "created_utc": 1587168515.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g3dqm1/stay_away_from_amzn_i_just_bought_2_calls/", "is_self": true}
