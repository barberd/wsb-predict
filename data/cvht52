{"id": "cvht52", "title": "Elizabeth Warren DD", "selftext": "Watched her at the rally today in Seattle. Unfortunately she didn't talk much about China and her preferred method (and to what degree) to pressure them as POTUS. \n\nSeattle is pretty gay and female and those folks seemed to turn out in force. The had to relocate to a larger venue laast minute just to accommodate everyone. I really think the demographics should be on her side to win big in the primary for cities like Seattle (which would give her the win in Washington), which I'm sure will also be true for all the big west coast cities which may be able to carry the election. I expect she will do well enough in middle american as an Oklahoman and her somewhat folky sensibility. \n\nSo anyway, it seems like she should safely capture the woman vote (west coast big cities) and be a more centrist alternative to meme candidates like Bernie while throwing out socialist enough sounding policies (that are impossible to pass through congress) to take some progressive votes. So I'm bullish that she wins the primaries based on what I saw today. \n\nOk who cares. How do I YOLO off of this? \n\nWell, her policies are geared towards a lot of fiscal overhaul and regulation, but I believe she is academic and connected enough to not fuck up the markets just for the sake of it (which can't be said for the other candidates...). I would be very short term bearish on how her winning the general election would affect the markets, for two big reasons. \n\n1. The biggest reason is her plan to invoke antitrust on the big tech giants- Amazon, Google, Facebook, etc. She is serious about this, and has the ability to do this from her position as chief executive. This will likely be short term bearish due to the disruption, but could end up giving investors more efficient opportunities to invest in the component pieces of these companies and may be medium/long term bullish. It also may help boost American tech by introducing more competition. I think these positives will not outweigh the initial negatives in terms of what is being priced in, so there should be a chance to bet that anti-trust is bullish. \n\n2. Her wealth tax of 2 cents on the dollar for Americans worth over 50 mil should have a huge effect on the market, since all this money is likely already invested so it is coming straight out of the market. She seems serious about it, and all her financial plans are directly in her academic expertise so I have no doubt she will pursue it to the degree she can.  I don't know how likely this is to be implemented without the help of congress, maybe impossible, so take this with a grain of salt. Any chance it *could* happen should spook investors upon her election, due to even a slight possibility we could see this devastating drawdown. \n\nTL;DR\n\nI am bullish that Warren has the coalition to win the primary based on her strong showing in a major west coast city. \n\nBetting that Warren will win primary: \n*If polls show her down or competitive before primaries (her win is not priced in), if her competitor is Biden position yourself bearish (SPY puts), if her competitor is Bernie position yourself bullish (SPY calls).\n\nBetting that Warren will win general election:\nIf the election outcome is uncertain, bet bearish past election day. Additionally, you can buy long dated calls after election day if you are bullish that her policies may end up not being implemented, or having a positive effect on corporate growth. \n\n-\n\nNote that I am retarded, and am not responsible for you devastating losses as a result of this advice. I am also not betting on this personally but will probably adjust my \"disgustingly overweight on semi-conductors\" portfolio to be less BTFO by these outcomes.", "created_utc": 1566785310, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cvht52/elizabeth_warren_dd/", "is_self": true}
