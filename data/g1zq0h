ABSOLUTE DISCIPLINE\n    Only buy / sell on predetermined rules (technical or fundamental). Have a checklist to check against the conditions in the market. ONLY enter the market after irreducible minimums\n\n2. FLEXIBILITY\n  Talking about flexibility , you should have in mind that facts in the market sometimes changes and that should align well with your mind. For example never STUBBORNLY HOLD ONTO A LOSING POSITION. That is why I advocate for a fixed stop loss. You should always look forward to the amount you will be losing rather than the one you will win. Rem HOPE IS FOR THE HOPELESS IN THE MARKET, Never hold a losing position with hopes.\n\n3. HARDWORK\n  Yes,  you have probably heard that Fx is an easy way of making millions out of the market. Now more than ever Forex could be the most challenging and cumbersome field. Remember there is no free lunch, you should spend timeless time studying and analyzing charts. Take your time in practicing demo so as to device your own strategy based on your personality. Remember to keep records, I personally use EDGEWonk, it is a good software. You can create a flashcard for that matter.\n\n4. BE PATIENT AND THINK LONG TERM\n    I need not to emphasize on this. But you should learn the magic of compounding. \n\n5.THINK INDEPENDENTLY\nThere is nothing like market gurus. No one knows where the market will go next. \n  Market is based on random emotions of investors. The emotions are basically two; fear and greed and this random motions was well captured by wave theorists , wykloft and Elliot. Therefore most of the time it is advised that you be opposite of the masses. \n\n6. RISK MANAGEMENT AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n    Always risk 1% of your account. Before you enter a trade ensure you use the position calculator tool, it is an utility tool that helps in choosing the perfect lot size.\n\n7. TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND LEARN FROM MISTAKES\n    Never blame the market , learn from your mistakes for you to become a professional trader. \n\n8.  NEVER ATTEMPT TO PREDICT THE MARKET\n   Any attempt to predict the market leads to bad performance.\nJust follow your rules and stick to the game plan\n\n\nGuys that is all I had today . I have been trading for the past 5 yrs and I have learnt that for you to be in the market and profitable it takes your psychology. How you control your emotions. You see consistency is all that matters in this game. And with consistency comes long-term profitability. \n\nHappy 'piping' and may the market be with you . :)", "created_utc": 1586981497.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1zq0h/trading_psychology_master_this_and_you_will_be/", "is_self": true}
