{"id": "cx27x1", "title": "Advice for a living meme?", "selftext": "So I got started with options trading last week with roughly 15k that I\u2019d been using to trade stocks. By Friday at market open, my account was at 54k, from a combination of Target, BJs, and CRM calls. So basically, I was WSB last week. \n\nAfter selling my target calls too early, I held onto CRM. Long story short, I sold those for an eventual loss yesterday. I lost my shirt on Best Buy earnings, and after taking my principal + 1500 out of Robinhood, I\u2019m left with about 8,000, which is sunk into whatever you\u2019d like to call my Best Buy calls, work day calls, and long term Grocery outlet calls. \n\nDisappointed in myself would be an understatement, I\u2019m 22 and I never could have imagined making money like I did last week. Now I\u2019m trying to figure out how to deal with the downside of this shit. I know it could be worse, I could\u2019ve dipped into my principal, and I still have nice gains for a week, but today has been devastating. How do people handle lost tendies? \n\nTldr; 3.5x 15k on TGT BJs CRM in one week, down to 23k, I am the WSB meme, need mindset advice", "created_utc": 1567091501, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cx27x1/advice_for_a_living_meme/", "is_self": true}
