They will take a loss, but possibly could spin directTV to dish for some sort of merger acquisition, allowing them to free up a ton of debt. With their ability to expand on their television services, for people who are cable cutting, packages that can have cable/internet bundles or unlimited data, I feel as if AT&T can explode. \n\nThoughts?\n\nIt could go up, it could go down, but can it make us money so we can all have a good ok\u2019 fashioned sex party?", "created_utc": 1590005555.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gniwm8/att_hbo_service_and_trying_to_dish_directtv/", "is_self": true}
