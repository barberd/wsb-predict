{"id": "g2dhot", "title": "Nothing new here. Stop whining.", "selftext": "The last three weeks this sub has been crying about how nothing makes sense and that they are losing money because the market should be going down on bad news. Must be the Fed. It's the Fed. Fuck JPow.\n\nI'm going to guess that 99% of you are new to trading. Do yourself a favor and go watch some investing/trading videos or read a book. One of the first things you learn is that the market does not make sense. The old adage \"the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent\" wasn't coined last week. Yes, the market goes up on bad news and down on good news. That's how it works. That's how it has always worked. That's why people have been losing their shirts for 100 years in this game.\n\nIf you want to make money consistently and not get wiped out, learn TA. I'll wait for you to stop laughing. Done? OK, now shut up and listen. No one is here to make money 40 years down the road. We want our money now. And if stocks don't move according to the news then all you really have left is TA. But you all think it's bunk because you don't understand it. You don't get that TA is not about predicting moves with 100% accuracy. It's about predicting moves more often than not and, more importantly, to trade in and out at the right times to mitigate losses and maximize gains. You can lose 9/10 times and still come out on top if the 10th time gives you more than all your losses combined. That's the point of TA - to win overall, not on every trade.\n\nSo pay attention to the news but don't depend on it. Stop YOLO'ing because that will break you faster than it will make you. And trade smart. The market is a casino if you treat it like one but it's a way to make a living if you treat it like a job.\n\nAh, hahahahaha... who am I kidding?
