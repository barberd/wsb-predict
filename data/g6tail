Now, it seems like it may have its possibility, especially because there is a clinical trial happening on it right now.\n\nHere are also some related news articles on it.\n\n [http://www.rfi.fr/en/science-and-technology/20200422-is-it-possible-the-bcg-vaccine-protect-against-the-new-coronavirus](http://www.rfi.fr/en/science-and-technology/20200422-is-it-possible-the-bcg-vaccine-protect-against-the-new-coronavirus) \n\n [https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/doctor-note-coronavirus-tuberculosis-vaccine-200421084403521.html](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/doctor-note-coronavirus-tuberculosis-vaccine-200421084403521.html) \n\n [https://www.yahoo.com/news/coronavirus-could-pandemic-controlled-using-082739096.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/coronavirus-could-pandemic-controlled-using-082739096.html) \n\n [https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/04/21/oral-polio-vaccine-has-potential-treat-coronavirus-column/5162859002/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/04/21/oral-polio-vaccine-has-potential-treat-coronavirus-column/5162859002/) \n\n*note, some of these argue against it, and I recommend reading them. Also this is not saying that this is a cure, this is just saying that it is highly possible this has an effect.*\n\n**TL;DR Spy 350c 5/2**\n\n**I flaired as DD because this will maybe make you think longer before buying puts. Also there is not one company that owns BCG, but many biotech companies have rights to it.**", "created_utc": 1587670641.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6tail/bcg_the_vaccine_for_tuberculosis_may_have/", "is_self": true}
