{"id": "glhcvh", "title": "D-Day Week For Tankers", "selftext": "Alright you SICK fucks. If you\u2019re like me and diamond handing Tanker calls and Stonks pre-dip and averaged down in the dip then bravo to all the retards like me and you alike \ud83d\udc4f \ud83d\udc4f \n\nThis is the week that if we don\u2019t see positive momentum in the tanker sector then you better be long or gone because we are in for a rough ride on a limp dick sideways.\n\nHere\u2019s the factors:\n\n1) The Mother fucking Oil Futures Bill is due - okay so those retards in April surely learned their lesson and won\u2019t be gambling on holding the futures bag up until delivery day right!? Their mom said they won\u2019t let them store another 1000 barrels in her basement again and really wish they would get a real job. These fucks definitely learned their lesson.\n\n2) OPEC+ Production reduction junction- oh yeah these oil leveraged fucks are cutting production. You know what they aren\u2019t cutting? Their fucking exports and who loves exports? Tanker bro\u2019s do\n\n3) VLCC Spot Rates - Spot rate speculation has been the main factor in stocks going down 2H is pessimistic from a market perspective. However while LR/Afra rates have been going down VLCC rates have held a strong floor for 56k. THAT IS STILL MORE THAN DOIBLE THE INDUSTRY AVERAGE RATE. So what companies are benefiting from that? $DHT $EURN $FRO\n\n4) NAT Earnings Call - I don\u2019t even know what to think of this shit show but if for some reason they do well and all those FOMO fuckers come back we may see another short squeeze and if that happens then take your tendies and GET THE FUCK OUT. Unless you\u2019re long dong Johnson on Q2-4 like me.\n\n5) EURN Holders are voting on May 20th to approve a 10% buyback\n\nEdit 6) Oh yeah 20% of the world fleet will be stuck storing oil at sea for quite some time. This will lower the supply of ships available to transport oil. Which will help bolster the spot rates and increase Tanker revenue again.\n\nTLDR; A LOT OF SHIT IS GOING DOWN THIS WEEK FOR TANKERS YOU FUCKERS. PARTY BOAT IS LEAVING PORT MONDAY AT OPEN.\n\nMissionary Positions:\n\nDHT 170 Shares\nDHT $9c 10/16\n\nEURN $12.5c 6/19\n\nTNK $22.5c 6/19\n\nSTNG $22c 6/19", "created_utc": 1589729602.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/glhcvh/dday_week_for_tankers/", "is_self": true}
