{"id": "fkgdjx", "title": "F Puts", "selftext": "Good evening fellow \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b, in case you haven\u2019t heard, Ford puts are having a huge blowout sale right now. They\u2019re shutting down their plant so those tendies are gonna come in QUICK. For only $80 a pop, you can get your 4/17 puts that have a break even price of only 70 cents below what it is right now. For reference, F was 70 cents above its current level only last Friday. Get em and get em QUICK!\n\nEDIT: SOME plants, not all their plants.", "created_utc": 1584491466.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkgdjx/f_puts/", "is_self": true}
