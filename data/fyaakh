From the person assisting the sick in the hospitals to the person working in the stores. No one honestly gives a shit that they're working being exposed to the virus. All of the essential employees know this. \n\nI understand the media likes to pretend that people are thankful but lets be honest. No one here has probably treated any grocery clerk or any essential any better than they usually don't.  That's fine because this world is cruel and thankless. But I'm tired of the media pretending like people are thankful when they aren't. Just look at how unjustly the FED has bailed out wallstreet and has allowed failing companies to get by. Look how at these same companies will get rid of loyal employees in order to save pennies. You don't have to pretend you give a shit about essential employees. Just compensate them with hazard pay.\n\nWHAT YOU CAME FOR, THE BEARS WILL RISE AGAIN.\n UNEMPLOYMENT THROUGH ESSENTIAL EMPLOYEES\n\nYou make $600/ week if not more collecting unemployment where I live. $18.50/hr working 40 hours a week is $604 after taxes. Majority of Americans do not make more than $18.50 an hour. I'm sure a lot of you degenerate gamblers can confirm this. You can also file for unemployment due to COVID-19 related reasons and the reasoning can be ambiguous. My friends have been quitting there jobs and claiming that they have family at home/worried about catching the virus/ or finding any reason they can muster AND IT HAS WORKED.\nWith that being said, if most Americans make less than $18.50/hour. Why not stay home and collect unemployment? With all of the FEDs inflation the initial pay you're recieving is not worth the squeeze anyways. The $7.50 you were making as a store clerk isn't worth it. And essential employees are starting to realize this.\n\nConclusion?\nThe FED will have to either pump more money and reward essential employees. Or the unemployment rate will rise because essential employees will riot.\nWith that being said, I've seen many friends and family tale advantage of this loophole and have quit their essential employment and are now collecting unemployment while making more chilling at home.\n\nUnemployment will rise and this theory hasn't been priced in. READY YOUR MID-LATE APRIL PUTS\n\nEdit: HOW DO I FIX MY TITLE I MEANT UNEMPLOYMENT WILL RISE.
