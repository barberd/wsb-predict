{"id": "gk4lp6", "title": "Strangle Tendies out of SPY", "selftext": "Afer consistently losing money, I found a simple Tendie printing formula. The reason I'm sharing is so that you Rain Men can help me refine for maximum printing capacity:  \n\nHere's the DD:  \n\nSince February 20th, the price of SPY has consistently swung either upwards or downwards at least $2.50 from the opening price, 58 out of the last 60 trading days. (the other 2 of 60 days swung $2.02 and $1.86 from the opening price).  \n\nStrategy:  \n\n*1. Every day at the Open, buy a Strangle two strikes away from the Opening price - I always wait a minute or two from the opening bell so that pricing normalizes a little. If, for example, Spy opens at or near $285, buy a $283P and a 287C. Adjust accordingly.  \n\n*2. Immediately after purhcase, set a sell order for your strangle at 1.05X your total purchase. If your Strangle cost $4, set a close order at $4.20 (I set mine at 1.075X but I don't want you to lose too many Tendies in the event the pattern breaks). Once your position sells, don't look at the chart again because you will hate yourself for not having diamond hands.  \n\n*3. If your strangle doesn't sell, make sure to close out the position before the end of the day so that the Greeks don't fuck you.  \n\n*4. Rinse and repeat.  \n\nNow, how do we improve on this? Are there other stocks with this same pattern? I haven't looked at the 3X ETF's or other meme stocks but I imagine there's a better play.", "created_utc": 1589527757.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gk4lp6/strangle_tendies_out_of_spy/", "is_self": true}
