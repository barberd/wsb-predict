Ad revenue is 90% of their business, so that's why investors freaked. This was a one time event that imo is an easy fix for the short-term.

So these two companies are basically worth the same to investors as it stands right now. \n\nIf you ask me Twitter more strongly reflects a company like FB than it does Snapchat. And FB currently trades  at a P/e ratio around 31. Twitter's p/e is around half that at 14. \n\nI love using Snapchat but their business model is trash, everything they do gets copied by other platforms i/e Instagram stories. They're not a news outlet or a place to find information like twitter, monetizing off lens filters is a joke. \n\nTwitter to $40.
