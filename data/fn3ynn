TLDR: BHVN - Biohaven Pharma is a solid buy at this discount. PT of $50 by Q4 2020. Dunno about options, I'm not nearly autistic enough to buy options on speculative pharma companies. Post is missing some images my article has, too lazy to put them in on reddit. You can look shit up yourselves on their deck and website if you want to do more DD than all the shit I wrote for you.\n\nBiohaven Pharmaceuticals (BHVN) has had quite the volatile 2020 fueled by both positive and negative announcements. I have been watching the company for the past year, but hadn't found an optimal time to enter. The recent market downturn has done just that, provided a great entry point for investors to really capitalize on the future of Biohaven.\u00a0\n\nRecent Breakthroughs\n\n**Verdiperstat**\n\nThe FDA recently granted Biohaven both [Orphan Drug designation](https://www.biohavenpharma.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/02-19-2019) and\u00a0fast track status for Verdiperstat, a myeloperoxidase (MPO) inhibitor, for the treatment of multiple system atrophy (MSA). The FDA has officially acknowledged the high unmet medical need for people suffering with MSA. The Fast Track designation may help accelerate the development of verdiperstat as the first treatment aimed at slowing progression of this devastating disease.\u00a0Verdiperstat is a potential brain-penetrant, irreversible inhibitor of myeloperoxidase, an enzyme that acts as a key driver of pathological oxidative stress and inflammation in the brain. A phase 3, multinational clinical trial is currently ongoing to evaluate the efficacy of verdiperstat in MSA patients. So far, in approximately 250 patients that have been dosed, the drug has been well tolerated and safe while demonstrating target engagement through lowering blood MPO activity. Reducing blood MPO activity in turn reduces neuralinflammation in patients (specifically with parkinsons). [In the Phase IIa trial](https://www.biohavenpharma.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/02-19-2019) of\u00a012 weeks of treatment, placebo-treated patients worsened by 4.6 points (SE=1.1, n=17) on the Unified MSA Rating Scale, while verdiperstat-treated patients worsened by 3.7 points (SE= 1.2, n=17) at the 300mg twice-daily dose and by 2.6 points (SE=1.4, n=18) at the 600mg twice-daily dose. Roughly [0.6 out of 100,000 people (roughly 1900 cases per year)](https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/multiple-system-atrophy/) are diagnosed with MSA annually making this disease a rare and low occurring disease that has no viable treatment options that target MSA directly. Licensed from AstraZeneca ([AZNCF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AZNCF)), verdiperstat's current Phase IIa trial is set to last until Q4 2020 where the company will evaluate the 52-week data.\u00a0\n\n**NURTEC ODT**\n\nThe largest and most recent news was the FDA approval of\u00a0NURTEC ODT (rimegepant) for the acute treatment of migraine in adults.\u00a0The single\u00a0oral dose of NURTEC ODT 75 mg can provide fast pain relief and return patients to normal function within one hour, and deliver sustained efficacy that lasts up to 48 hours for many patients. Uniquely, the pill disperses immediately in patients mouths without the need to swallow pills presenting convenient ingestion for many individuals that have difficulty with pills. CEO of Biohaven, Dr. Vlad Coric commented,\n\n>\"Millions of people suffering from migraine are often not satisfied with their current acute treatment, at times having to make significant tradeoffs because of troublesome side effects and reduced ability to function. NURTEC ODT is an important new oral acute treatment for migraine that offers patients the potential to quickly reduce and eliminate pain and get back to their lives.\"\u00a0\n\nNURTEC ODT functions through blocking CGRP receptors, treating a root cause of migraine. NURTEC ODT is not an opioid or narcotic, does not have addiction potential and is not scheduled as a controlled substance by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. The drug is extremely well tolerated with nausea as the most common adverse effect that only 2% of patients experienced.\n\n[The FDA approval of NURTEC ODT is based on results from the pivotal Phase III clinical trial and the long-term](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2020/212728s000lbl.pdf), open-label safety study. In the Phase III trial, NURTEC ODT achieved statistical significance on the regulatory co-primary endpoints of pain freedom and freedom from most bothersome symptom (MBS) at two hours post dose compared to placebo. NURTEC ODT also demonstrated statistical superiority at one hour for pain relief (reduction of moderate or severe pain to no pain or mild pain) and return to normal function. The benefits of pain freedom, pain relief, return to normal function and freedom from MBS were sustained up to 48 hours for many patients. Importantly, these benefits were seen with only a single dose of NURTEC ODT. Eighty-six percent of patients treated with NURTEC ODT did not require rescue medication (e.g. NSAIDS, acetaminophen) within 24 hours post dose. The long-term safety study assessed the safety and tolerability of rimegepant with multiple doses used over up to one year. The study evaluated 1,798 patients, who used rimegepant 75 mg as needed to treat migraine attacks, up to one dose per day. The study included 1,131 patients who were exposed to rimegepant for at least six months, and 863 who were exposed for at least one year, all of whom treated an average of at least two migraine attacks per month.\u00a0\n\nAs Biohaven's first FDA approved drug, the company has a pretty robust go to market strategy that involves a [\"Surround Sound\" approach](https://www.biohavenpharma.com/sites/default/files/BIOHAVEN%20Investor%20Presentation%20Cowen%204March.pdf). They plan on targeting both Healthcare practitioner programs as well as peers through consistent engagement and education on the true benefits of NURTEC ODT. The company is embracing a social first mindset among the heavy scrutiny surrounding opioid and pharmaceutical markets. With this in mind, they are engaging in a 6 month implementation program to launch a payer program for CGRP migraine prevention class while engaging major insurance carriers such as Cigna, Anthem, Aetna and many more. Below lays out the true benefits of NURTEC ODT to the patient population.\n\nMizuho analyst Vamil Divan commented prior to approval that estimates for rimegepant scale to approximately $1 billion in sales by 2030, for its use in acute migraine treatment.\n\nRecent Downfalls\n\nQ4 missed earnings, reporting a GAAP EPS of -$2.85 compared to the projected -$1.93 consensus. The miss was attributed to several large factors I will lay out below but the big hit is hard to swallow despite having many favorable events on the horizon for the company.\n\nThe major factor contributing to decline in share price outside of the Corona Virus activity is the failure of troriluzole\u00a0[Phase III clinical trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03829241?lead=biohaven&phase=2&draw=2&rank=2) evaluating troriluzole as monotherapy in patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) failed to sufficiently separate from placebo on the primary endpoint of total HAM-A score at week 8.\u00a0The company will terminate development for monotherapy use in GAD. Several studies in other diseases and with different dosing approaches are in process.\u00a0It hurst to see a study in Phase III be discontinued. That is years of hard work and money down the drain to start fresh. With NURTEC ODT being approved shortly after this announcement, we should see the events balance out with the NURTEC ODT news slightly outweighing the effects of troriluzole.\u00a0\u00a0Additionally troriluzole will be continued through several other avenues. Earlier this year, troriluzole dosed at 280mg successfully advanced past an interim futility analysis in its pivotal Phase II/III trial in Alzheimer's disease study performed after 100 subjects completed 6 months of treatment. Completion of the troriluzole in Alzheimer's Disease trial is expected in 4Q 2020, and topline data is anticipated from the troriluzole adjunctive therapy obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) trial in 2Q 2020 and from the troriluzole in SCA trial in 2021.\u00a0There is light at the end of the tunnel for the drug candidate with different indications.\u00a0\n\nFinances\n\nThe company's recently reported earnings missed pretty significantly. Biohaven was hit with a massive registration fee exceeding $100 million as well as filing fees for NURTEC ODT NDA and commercialization preparation. As expenses pile up around the go to market with NURTEC ODT, we expect to see high expenses the first few quarters following the approval with leveling off as build out is finalized and revenues begin to be generated.\u00a0The Company reported a net loss attributable to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $528.8 million, or $10.91 per share, compared to $240.9 million, or $6.15 per share for the same period in 2018.\n\nRaised Gross Proceeds of Approximately $287.5 million in secondary offering \u2013 In January 2020, Biohaven closed an underwritten public offering of 4,830,917 common shares at a price to the public of $51.75 per share and in February 2020, the underwriter exercised its option and purchased an additional 724,637 shares; gross proceeds from the offering were approximately $287.5 million, adding to cash as of December 31, 2019, of $316.7 million, excluding $1.0 million of restricted cash.\n\nConclusion\n\nFDA approval, strong cash position and positive forward looking growth is going to drive Biohaven to new highs. The company will use its flagship product NURTEC ODT to gain market share in the acute migraine space while developing their late stage pipeline towards NDA filing and FDA approvals. With several Phase II/III clinical trials ongoing and data results projected towards the 2H 2020, Biohaven is at an optimal buying level. The stock currently sits under $30 a share, massively oversold from the failure of troriluzole Phase III study and recent Corona Virus market activity. While it is hard to call a bottom on any market, sub $30 is a rare price level for this stock. When you take into account the late stage pipeline and projected revenues from NURTEC ODT it is hard to pass up. The company has seen both FDA approval and trial failure leading to discontinuing a Phase III study in 2020 already. With such a busy 1Q, Biohaven is shaping up to have a bullish 2H 2020.\n\n**Upcoming Milestones:**\n\nBiohaven expects to reach significant pipeline milestones with its CGRP receptor antagonists, glutamate modulators and myeloperoxidase inhibitors in 2020.\n\nThe Company expects to:\n\n* Report Phase 2/3 topline data for troriluzole in OCD in the second quarter of 2020.\n* Report Phase 2/3 topline data from ongoing trial evaluating troriluzole in Alzheimer's disease around the end of 2020.\n* Complete enrollment in Phase 3 trial of troriluzole in Spinocerebellar Ataxia in the second quarter of 2020.\n* Continue enrolling patients in Phase 2 proof of concept trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of rimegepant in patients with treatment refractory trigeminal neuralgia.\n* Continue enrolling patients in Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of MSA, a rare, rapidly progressive and fatal neuroinflammatory disease with no cure or effective treatments.\n* Conduct ongoing non-clinical studies defined under the scientific research agreement with University of Connecticut to support the advancement of UC1MT, a therapeutic antibody targeting extracellular metallothionein.", "created_utc": 1584900190.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fn3ynn/dd_biohaven_pharma_strong_buy_50_pt_by_4q_2020/", "is_self": true}
