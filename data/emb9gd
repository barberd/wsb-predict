With phase 1 of the trade deal set to be signed next wednesday, let's take a look at all of the concessions that FREEDOM has taken from the communist sumbitches.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The tariffs, which were put into place for the sole reason of bringing china to the table, will be either cancelled or repealed (i.e. a return to the pre-trade-war status quo)\n* China will increase their purchase of US farm goods, which they had lowered solely as a response to the tariffs designed to bring them to the table, back up to the level they were at before the tariffs (i.e. a return to the pre-trade-war status quo)\n* China pledges not to devalue the yuan, which is a pledge they have been statutorily required to make in every trade deal they've entered since joining the WTO in 2001 (i.e. literally no change)\n* China agrees to \"better protect\" the IP of American businesses, which they have been statutorily required to protect (for every nation doing business in their borders) since their joining the WTO in 2001 (i.e. literally no change)\n* Though trump has claimed he will travel to Beijing personally to kick off negotiations for phase 2, Chinese representatives have repeatedly warned that there will be no phase 2 unless they are happy with the implementation of phase 1\n\nI for one am glad that it only took 2 years of bickering for the fucksticks in charge to turn both countries around a full 360 degrees.
