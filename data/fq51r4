They are currently seeking for a credit line but the country already said they are gonna use their 1.5 billions cash reserve to give people some money and buy medicaments, etc. Their total assets it\u2019s 4 millions and  700k I\u2019m cash and they are paying their employees for this month and the month of April even when not working.
