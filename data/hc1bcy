{"id": "hc1bcy", "title": "It's Burger Time", "selftext": "This summer has been all about SPAC's such as VTIQ/NKLA and FMCI. While a lot of us reaped some rewards I say we're not done yet. The somewhat unexplored company I have found is called BurgerFi which will be acquired under a blank check (OPES). BurgerFI specialized in fresh meat and burgers akin to Shake Shack. BurgerFi is currently in 2 countries and 23 states with the merger they shall expand into the States, manifest Destiny like eh? The sales as well as the revenue has been growing positively every year since its conception 9 years ago.\n\nHere are some positives to note from BurgerFi:\n\nThey have partnered with REEF kitchens so as to expand their services into tech based areas.\n\nBurgerFi plans on opening 3 \"Ghost Kitchens\", which are delivery only operations and one of them is going to be in Miami.\n\nBurgerFi will enter big cities such as Seattle, Houston, Nashville and Minneapolis by the end of 2020.\n\nBurgerFi will merge with the blank check (OPES) by the end of the month and bless us with their beautiful tendies. THIS IS A GROWTH AND EXPANSIONARY STOCK. It literally cannot go tits up.\n\nCurrently the stock is at 17.95.\n\nTL;DR: Burgers and Tendies for all with OPES!", "created_utc": 1592575689.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hc1bcy/its_burger_time/", "is_self": true}
