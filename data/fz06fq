{"id": "fz06fq", "title": "Another grey swan: US Debt Downgrades", "selftext": "TLDR: Regular Americans are becoming pissed over the BRRRRRR which will most likely not trickle down. [This top post is true](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fyt6mm/for_everyone_who_wants_to_understand_what_the_fed/) (the BRRRR is only filling in a liquidity gap, and funds will start realizing the costs of a sudden stop = lower everything). It's only a matter of time before the CRAs decide to drop the rating again.\n\nPositions: Last time the US sov rating was dropped, equities dropped. Beyond any belief, US Treasuries were bid up. Looking to play this again through long Treasuries or IG bonds since the Fed is buying them anyways, and they are a risk-off hedge. (/ZN futures, GOVT, TLT, LQD). [The next rating review should be July.](https://www.standardandpoors.com/en_US/delegate/getPDF?articleId=2368297&type=COMMENTS&subType=REGULATORY)\n\n\\-----\n\nWait... I remember this from 2011. This fast moving zombie of markets have gone through the early years of the recession in about a month. 2007 with overvalued assets was Jan, 2008/2009 was Feb to mid-March, 2010 with coordinated rescues was March, 2010 when declining financial markets started to take its toll on main street was also late March, and 2011/12 with sovereign debt downgrades (US, GR, IT etc) is probably going to be the month of April.\n\nIf you take a look at all the commentary to why the [US debt rating was dropped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_government_credit-rating_downgrades) in 2011 and outlooks remained negative up to now, it's because of 2 main reasons.\n\n1. Rising income inequality (lol like the rating agencies really care about poors)\n2. Inability to service the debt (no shit)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Based on the scientific study of reading [reddit posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxw3uz/why_should_any_american_company_ever_act/), it seems like regular Americans are pissed about the bailout which mainly went to corporate. I mean, the money should eventually trickle down, and this move actually saves investors including everyone with a retirement account, but poor people without savings make the biggest noise. Just look at what an unemployed artist did about a century ago.\n2. This is the big one. Debt in normal times is supposedly serviced by government revenue, which in large parts are taxes. In the US, most of this [comes in the form of income, payroll and corporate taxes](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/policy-basics-where-do-federal-tax-revenues-come-from). What happens when large parts of the economy are shut down? Surprise! No income and no corporate profits, which means there is no tax liability. This is why the Fed has been directly monetizing the debt by buying Treasuries as soon as they're written.\n\nThe CRAs have been downgrading corporates right and left these last weeks, so they're not afraid of making enemies. It's only a matter of time before big daddy America joins the crowd. [Take a look at CDS] (http://www.worldgovernmentbonds.com/cds-historical-data/united-states/5-years/)\n\nThe bloated balance sheet of the Fed will probably not be rolled off. It will reduce if the Fed decides to sell their holdings (unlikely if we learned from Japan in the last 20 years). The treasury, upon finding this everlasting fountain, will most likely continue rolling the debt forward. Rolling forward, in autistic terms, is doing a ponzi.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what to do in this case? As long as the US Dollar remains as the dominant world currency, liquidity still equals dollars. From what happened in 2011, [equity markets dropped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_2011_stock_markets_fall) after the announcement. Against what most people thought, US Treasuries were still bid up as people flocked to a risk-off asset. In 2020, we have to recognized runaway inflation might be a problem (higher yields = lower price). However, trying to short bonds in the face of this would be trying to fight against the [Time Person of the Year 2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxu37i/2020_time_person_of_the_year/).", "created_utc": 1586593881.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fz06fq/another_grey_swan_us_debt_downgrades/", "is_self": true}
