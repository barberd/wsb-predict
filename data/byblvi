The beauty of this play is that there is zero risk. Uranium is in a huge bear market and is about to explode in the next year or 2. All these stocks are at their lows and have zero downside. Go look at the max charts on all of them, they are identical. When this shit pops, its gonna rocket right past uranus. If Trump mandates a quota on US uranium, UUUU, URG, and UEC will take off. If he doesnt, they will stay right where they are. But, as soon as the spot price comes back up, you're gonna see a big spike anyways. Production is being cut and a supply shortfall is incoming. Look up Mike Alkin on youtube for further info, he knows his shit. So, 232 deadline is July 14th but nobody long really cares. This will, however get the ball rolling on increasing spot prices and the upcoming bull run. I own 5000 of each stock listed as well as a shit ton of CCJ and CCJ 20 dollar strike leaps for next year. Go look at the charts, i doubt we see 2007 levels but the spike that occured after that is very possible. Also like DNN as a possible buyout play and a couple others in the mining sector but those are more of a lotto play. Only a couple big dogs in this sector", "created_utc": 1560022221, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/byblvi/if_you_liked_chernobyl_youll_love_this/", "is_self": true}
