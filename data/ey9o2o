{"id": "ey9o2o", "title": "The REAL Reason Stonks Only Go Up", "selftext": "So as we\u2019ve all seen, the stock market literally cannot go down. I was down 50k last week, before I switched to only buying calls. Now I\u2019m only down 30k! \n\nBut this got me thinking, why does every dip get bought? Why does the market only know one direction (UP)? Why do puts die in hell and calls go to heaven? \n\nIt\u2019s simple: Let\u2019s say you could buy derivatives based on derivatives. So you can buy calls or puts on calls or puts. \n\nWell if you buy calls on calls, you GAIN money when calls go UP. But if you buy puts on puts, you LOSE money when puts go UP. So as you can see, Calls^2 is worth more than Puts^2. Therefore, Calls are worth more than Puts. \n\nEat shit, bears.", "created_utc": 1580747580, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ey9o2o/the_real_reason_stonks_only_go_up/", "is_self": true}
