{"id": "elwx6y", "title": "Can\u2019t we all just get along?", "selftext": "Bear here. Full disclosure, I don\u2019t know when the market will go down. I don\u2019t know how much higher it will go before it does go down, or how much it will go down, when it goes down. I\u2019m not trying to time the market, for I do not possess the power to do so. \n\nMy question is this: Why the hostility these days? This sub is for demonstrating retardedness, not taunting the other side each time SPY moves 50 basis points in the direction your \u201cgang\u201d thinks it will go. We are united in our autism, and that is too frequently forgotten these days.\n\nThe reason I\u2019m not bullish on the market at the moment is that *i don\u2019t have to be*. I\u2019ve enjoyed this run up with you all to this point, have plenty of assets, and if the market goes up another 10-20% and I miss out, I\u2019ll still have a great life. My paychecks will keep rolling in, and I\u2019ll be able to buy all the applesauce and Go-Gurt I\u2019ll ever need. When the market eventually goes to shit and we all lose our jobs, I will then turn to my TVIX proceeds to replenish my equity exposure and refrigerator. \n\nBe safe, guys. Stocks do go down. As a 32 year old dinosaur I was hit with this reality very early on in my investing career.
