{"id": "g6cj2m", "title": "Stock Thread 2.0", "selftext": "Alright retards, I got some good feedback on my last stock thread and the plays worked out well, so I wanted to share some other stock picks that I have been either recently entering or considering entering. If you're here to debate whether or not SPY will go up tomorrow, you have come to the wrong place.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n$BA - [https://imgur.com/a/3cqSVEl](https://imgur.com/a/3cqSVEl)\n\nAfter coiling in a wedge for the past few weeks, BA has gotten EXTREMELY tight with volume that keeps coming in. This consolidation has to go somewhere, so I'm expecting an explosive move in the next 3-5 days. I bought straddles yesterday, and since It broke below the wedge trend and then found resistance on the same line ([https://imgur.com/a/S0eRRad](https://imgur.com/a/S0eRRad)) I sold my calls and am holding my puts for tomorrow. They also just cut 10% of their employees which came out around 30 minutes before the closing bell. I would recommend put-heavy straddles for this one since whichever way it goes, it's gonna go big.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n$EAT - [https://imgur.com/a/OnXp0Zk](https://imgur.com/a/OnXp0Zk)\n\nAfter the big drop, this one has been showing a lot of strength in its current trend. I really love this one as the volume has been continuing to come in, My PT for this one is $20-$22.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n$ZM - [https://imgur.com/a/F1rnAKB](https://imgur.com/a/F1rnAKB)\n\nThis one got a huge rally from the hype of working from home, but they have had several problems that have led to their userbase completely disappearing. Two of my family members are teachers whose school district banned ZM due to security problems and have been using the INFINITE FREE alternatives. I think this hype train will soon die, but I like mid-long term puts for this one. If it breaks the high of last peak, sell and wait.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n$SNAP - [https://imgur.com/a/DPywDWa](https://imgur.com/a/DPywDWa)\n\nWith the RSI going straight up in 1 day, I'm going to add some puts either tomorrow or the following day, as I think it could still have some juice left in it. Let's face it - this company is fucking horrendous, and the only reason they beat earnings was due to the fact that nobody has anything else to do with their free time while locked inside. I'm not going to get greedy here, so I'll likely buy 1 month out puts with strike price \\~$16.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReminder: I am not a financial advisor. I have a degree in both marketing and finance but I trade stocks for personal income, not for my profession. Don't be a retard and buy everything you see on this subreddit, these are just some suggestions that I personally am trying to play. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso - too lazy for a write up right now but I love GLD here for calls.", "created_utc": 1587600405.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6cj2m/stock_thread_20/", "is_self": true}
