I know I can\u2019t recover shit now as I\u2019ve lost too much. You know, my dad used to say that trading is easy, it's like riding a bike. Well my fellow brothers, trading is like riding a bike. Except the bear gang is on fire, the economy is on fire, Robinhood is on fire, and my poor bastard of a wallet is on fire. Everything is on fire and shit went to hell. Then last night, I had a revelation. My autism slapped me as hard as an Asian mom when there is a C on the report card. \n\nI'm gonna go all out in one final YOLO. That means balls deep in TESLA calls. That means mega AMD puts. That means fucking NVIDA puts. That means doing a Mickey wipe on DIS calls. I\u2019m gonna take on all the mother fucking analysts as this shit will explode. For better or worst I\u2019ll \u201cblow up like c-4 when it\u2019s 3 \u2013 3 at the free throw\u201d. I\u2019m gonna cash every single penny of my boozs money (annual fund) for this \u201cstrategic\u201d yolo. Whether this goes down in flames or launch to the sky, I\u2019m going down as a shitty investor. If I lose it all, I will be a man and be bestow the honor to be sober the rest of the year. If I make it all, I\u2019ll start dumping DDs or memes every Saturday when I\u2019m drunk.", "created_utc": 1560795353, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c1r03n/yolo_like_there_is_no_tomorrow/", "is_self": true}
