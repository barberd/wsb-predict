{"id": "fdxl7d", "title": "FNKO YOLO", "selftext": "FNKO took a major dip earlier this year due to weak holiday sales because their main product is a stupid fucking bobblehead. With this, they still trade below peers in terms of P/S .46 compared to Hasbro at 2.32 and P/FCF 6.36 compared to 59.95 for Hasbro. They have also shown major EPS growth this past year. They also have low debt in their capital structure. They have low insider ownership but they have 91% institutional ownership. They also have a super high Float Short rate, so there could be a short squeeze if they have positive earnings. This is not professional investment advice. I'd like to flair this as DD but my wife's boyfriend thinks it is more of a yolo.", "created_utc": 1583425087, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fdxl7d/fnko_yolo/", "is_self": true}
