Once on the cruise, doctors are advising their patients to seek out any sick Italians and French them on the mouth. The cruise will 100% be extended to at least 14 days most likely 25. Once the patient is sick the cruise line will quarantine them, feed them and treat them until cured. Cruise lines are also the only ones that have Corona test kits in the  US. This is a much better plan for patience instead of going to the hospital or the ER where they have no test kits and will 100% let you die, and then bill $8,000 to your loved ones.\n\nSo there you have it retards, bookings are about to go 10,000% up. NCL, RCL, CCL, LMNOP are going GREEN baby!", "created_utc": 1583720856.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffnpax/retards_if_tomorrow_youre_going_short_on_rcl_ncl/", "is_self": true}
