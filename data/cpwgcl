Byrne has released the following statement:\n\n\u201cSara Carter has published two articles relating the following claims of mine:\n\n1. Starting in 2015 I (operating under the belief that I was helping legitimate law enforcement efforts) assisted in what are now known as the \u2018Clinton Investigation\u2019 and the \u2018Russian Investigation\u2019 (in fact, I am the notorious \u2018missing Chapter 1\u2019 of the Russian investigation). It was the third time in my life I helped the Men in Black: the first was when my friend Brian Williams [**was murdered**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=3Xwu5hJBSsprtam-B5GhExkEJ3cufjybl4BYjQ72aJkWaEW5D4Eeh6M6S5wJwt5muMTMsmebDYAQZYFdV4FfGjDgqoMcJ_AHzkRTHOBKeFR6e0WG9GS7dE9Cp2DEmRLv), and the second was when I helped the M.I.B.

Unfortunately, this third time turned out to be less about law enforcement and more about political espionage conducted against Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump (and to a lesser degree, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz).\n2. In July 2018 I put the pieces together. I immediately (last July) came forward to a Congressman and\u00a0a senior military officer, to the Department of Justice this April, and (upon my Omaha Rabbi reminding me of my duty as a citizen late this June) to a small set of journalists this summer. Ms. Carter was among them. Her two stories are accurate.\n\nHaving confirmed Ms. Carter\u2019s two articles, I have fulfilled those citizenship obligations of which my Rabbi reminded me. I will speak no more on the subject. Instead, having lived in places lacking Rule of Law and having witnessed the consequences of its absence, I plan on sitting back and watching the United States Department of Justice ***re-***establish Rule of Law in our country.\u201d", "created_utc": 1565717659, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cpwgcl/ostk_down_15_after_ceo_patrick_byrne_acknowledges/", "is_self": true}
