{"id": "bmtjth", "title": "Advice", "selftext": "So I have lost 50% of my portfolio over the last three weeks or so. This is also around when I discovered this autistic subreddit and option trading. Had one big win on INTC over night and got hooked. I don\u2019t even see a point of going back to buying and selling stocks. I was making small but consistent profits over 8 weeks, only about $400 on my 4.3k account. Option trading just has bigger moves and is more exciting than seeing pussy profits. \n\nAs I have hit this bump I decided to sell everything till this trade deal news is finalized since I lost a majority of my money this week. I have realized that I trade of emotions and FOMO on shit based on nothing but the posts on this sub. I started looking more into technical analysis. MACD, RSI, support and resistance levels, candle stick patterns. I know many people see technical analysis as complete bullshit. However, I believe it\u2019s a much better tool than trading off emotion.  This loss is a wake up call that inspired me to keep learning more and to start making rational decisions and if I\u2019m not in the mindset for that just sit on cash. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to YOLO on SPY 300 or MU 90 calls or some dumb shit like that, already seeing as it hasn\u2019t worked out. I do enjoy the autistic culture of this sub but it\u2019s time for me to get real. \n\nAny advice from anyone who has made it to the deep end of their portfolio and back? \n\nI appreciate it and thank you for taking the time to read/respond. Now let\u2019s get fucking rich boys.", "created_utc": 1557460144, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bmtjth/advice/", "is_self": true}
