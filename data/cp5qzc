{"id": "cp5qzc", "title": "Power Boss Earnings Play ( VFF )", "selftext": "Village Farms ( VFF ) is a produce/marijuana company who is reporting earnings tomorrow 5pm after close. I could write a page of DD but all you need to know is they are only valued at a small fraction ( 662 Million US ) compared to the rest.. and they are growing massive quantities of high quality Cannabis. They are currently on a uptrend and if the report is taken well it will most likely break ATHighs. They have many catalyst because of their US operations with hemp production and they still haven\u2019t announced any type of major partnerships. I think this is a High risk play but it is one of the safest in the sector. They have more room to grow then too fall. Take this as a pump or however you want too take it but I\u2019m just offering my opinion/advice. I\u2019ve been following for over a year and think it\u2019s a good short term play but even a more solid long term play. If tomorrow they shit the bed then I will try and add more whenever it bottoms out. You got companies like ACB and CGC valued in the billions and can\u2019t even turn a profit or come even close. VFF has already turned a profit with PureSunFarms and they will continue too. The share count is very small so this thing could rocket. That is all.", "created_utc": 1565574718, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cp5qzc/power_boss_earnings_play_vff/", "is_self": true}
