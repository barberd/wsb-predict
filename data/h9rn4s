To achieve a measly 0.3% SPY pump from Friday's close they had to devalue the dollar by 0.75% IN ONE DAY !\n\nWhat does that mean in retard terms ? \n\nSay that my autist niece is having a birthday party tomorrow, so this morning I called her favourite le frog baker in Paris to order some baguettes.\n\nMe : Monsiour Le Frog, 100 Baguettes please for tomorrow\n\nLe Frog : Oui Mr Bucks, that'll be 100 american dollars.\n\nMe : no problem froggy,put it in my AMEX.\n\nThen in the afternoon, the autistic niece told me she'll be having an extra 100 guests. Damn, 12 years old got a lot of social live going on nowdays.\n\nBack on the phone with Paris.\n\nMe : Froggy, add another 100 USD order for tomorrow.\n\nLe Frog : Oui Mr Bucks,  99 baguettes it is.\n\nMe : Whut ? It was for 100 baguette this morning\n\nLe Frog : Ah Mr Bucks, your le american dollar have fallen into the dumpster since this morning, so one Benjamin can only get you 99 baguettes now.\n\nMe : !@#$% !@#$\n\nI'm sure even retards can understand why this is not sustainable, pretty soon we won't be able to afford baguettes !\n\nSo in retard terms to get your SPY 350C to print the FED need to devalue the USD by 30% (NOT A GOOD THING)", "created_utc": 1592264147.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h9rn4s/hewooo_retards_carebear_here_warning_you_about/", "is_self": true}
