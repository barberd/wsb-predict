Last night an employee from the Marshall Space Flight Center tested positive for COVID-19. Reporting here from Huntsville, AL. Butt wipe? Gone. Disinfectant? Gone. Sugar? Gone. Vegetable oil? Gone. Lunch meat? 3/4 gone. Beans? 3/4 gone. Instant rice/noodles/hamburger helper? Gone. Jarred spaghetti sauce that these inbred fucks like more than homemade shit? Gone. Canned soups? 3/4 gone. Meat and fresh produce is still a go. And thanks for taking the diapers and baby wipes my 13 month old uses you stupid fucks. The customers at two different grocery stores in major parts of town are bipolar. Stocking up or not giving a shit. Either way it\u2019s all gone. At least my retarded ass will eat fresh meats and produce while I wait for my GE $5 3/20 & F $4.5 3/20 & EWI $15 6/19 puts to print next week. \n\nTL;DR  AINT NOBODY GUNNA FUCK MY SISTER BUT ME.", "created_utc": 1584207648.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fim6ix/my_state_made_the_final_4/", "is_self": true}
