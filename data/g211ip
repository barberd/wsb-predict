Thats cool, but stop buying puts that expire this week thinking the market is going to go down faster than your mom when she sees a horses erection. Get rid of your RH account and fuck off with the PTD bullshit. Get TOS, make sure your shit is set up with a cash account and stop locking yourself into positions that you dont want to hold overnight. \n\nToday - Spy opens down, cool, spy isnt going straight to the core of the earth. Buy spy call. Watch spy go up a little bit (todays mark for me was 278) then sell. Now buy spy put, cry as it reaches 279.5 but hold because its going to go down before expiration date, sell EOD for proffit. Stop yoloing your whole account looking for 198473682763658239% returns and bitching about how irrational the market is. Right now is almost as easy to trade as the circuit breaker days. Rinse and repeat. I promise you making 80 to 400 tendies a day is better than most of you retards are doing now. If you are one of those big rollers making sweet sweet tendies... good for you, this doesnt apply to you.", "created_utc": 1586985691.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g211ip/strategy_that_has_been_working_for_me/", "is_self": true}
