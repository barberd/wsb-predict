VG was formed from a one-shot vehicle that was designed to win the X-prize in 2004 by going into space. The haven't reached space (100km) since then.\n\nAlso, reports on the 2014 crash that killed a pilot indicate that they have a serious problem with their engineering culture. Most of the engineering talent came from Scaled Composites, where they would design prototypes or demo vehicles. Apparently this engineering mindset of prototype design has followed through to their production vehicles, where they will find and solve problems *as they come up*, rather than having detailed procedures for testing and troubleshooting.\n\nGiven the fact that SpaceShipTwo has been in development for well over a decade with still no paying customers flying (the first flights have been months away for a decade now), it's pretty hard to believe that they'll develop an *orbital* launch platform anytime soon, especially considering there are similar launch vehicles for similar prices already.", "created_utc": 1580144316, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/euqmtn/some_real_dd_for_spce_xpost_from_comment_in/", "is_self": true}
