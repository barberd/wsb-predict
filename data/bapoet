{"id": "bapoet", "title": "Urban Trade Breakdowns: The Hunt Brothers go to Washington", "selftext": "In physics there is a concept known as quantum entanglement, whereby two particles are bound together by some fucking mystery force such that, even if both particles are light-years apart from one another, if you fuck with one particle, the other particle gets equally fucked.  Einstein referred to this phenomena as \u201cspooky action at a distance\u201d.\u00a0 But as spooky as that may seem, you don\u2019t need to be no particle physicist to see this.  Our shit is entangled as fuck, especially when it comes to money and politics.  And here\u2019s an example of what can happen when we lose sight of the physical laws of money and politics.\n\nThis story starts with a dude by the name of HL Hunt.  Now right there you should be thinking, this must be one bad motherfucker.  He had two letters for a name. Fuck. But trust me, this dude is right up there with Livermore in the annals of American yolo aristocracy.  So much so that back in the day, even OG oil baller titans like Ghetty spoke reverently of the dude.\n\nHL was born in 1889 in fuck-knows-where Illinois. He was home-schooled but a math prodigy and he was burning through college algebra by the fourth grade.  As a teenager, he gets bored with shit at home and heads off on some kinda old-school American walkabout to figure his shit out. After drifting for a while, at the age of 23, Hunt hustles his way into a gig running a cotton plantation in Arkansas.  But in 1912, the plantation gets flooded and destroyed, and HL is left a suitcase and $100.  So he does the responsible thing: he goes to New Orleans to gamble.\u00a0 \n\nNow, Hunt always loved to gamble.\u00a0 As a kid, he would take a bet whenever he could and he used to sit in on local make-shift poker games, busting out hard-ass dust bowl men 4x his age.\u00a0 And when he felt good about a bet, he went all-in.\u00a0He didn\u2019t know another way.  Because back then, in pre safe-space human resource America, if you left the shit still breathing, there was always another game. But what made HL special was that when he won, he took care of the people around him.  He was principled and shot straight and endeared trust.  People liked him.  And when you when you have virtuous shit like that going for you, people tell you all kinds of useful secrets.\n\nSo in New Orleans HL gambles his $100 into more than $100,000.  And being who he is, some friendly motherfucker tips him off to the fact that in Texas, ranchers are bitching about all this all this oil bubbling up through the dirt and fucking up their pastures.  So HL goes to El Dorado, Texas and spends his winnings buying his first oil rights.\n\nAnd it turns out, that was a good idea.  And when the shit starts paying, he yolos the fuck out of his profits, buying oil rights far and wide.  And by the time of his death in 1974, HL owned majority rights to pretty much the entire East Texas Oil fields, at the time the largest known oil reserves in the world.  And he becomes rich as fuck.\n\nBut like all of us, HL had his issues. As a hard-ass self-made driller of shit, HL was hugely distrustful of the Federal government, with all their ivy leagues and committees and newspaper opinion pages.  What the fuck do they drill for in DC?  And as he got older, he became conspiratorial, believing the world was moving against him and he instilled in his two oldest boys, Nelson Bunker and and Lamar, a belief that to keep ahead of the men in the shadows, you gotta build real wealth, on shit like metal and crops and oil.\n\nSo all this is happening in the early 1970\u2019s in America, which, except for punk rock, was a fucking shitty decade.\u00a0 The post-war boom had long since fizzled and the US dollar was just not getting a lot of likes.  And after years of listening to all this kinda shit at the dinner table, the Hunt boys read the newspapers and see an oil crises and Vietnam and war in the middle-east and start to think, fuck, maybe he has a point.  Inflation (some ancient shit you may have read about) was like 14% and they had Nixon back in Washington saying shit like America no longer needs to back our money with gold.  That shit is old school.  We can just financial engineer our way out of this. Trust me. \n\nSo in the early 70\u2019s, because it was illegal in the US to invest in gold, the hunt brothers, all HL Texas paranoid and shit, decide to go all-in on the next best thing, the Litecoin of shiny metals: silver.\n\nAnd they bought the fuck out of the shit.  But the thing is, times change.  The younger Hunts, after a few years getting to know commodity markets and once almost cornering soy beans, they realize: buying and storing tons of metal is expensive and unnecessary in this day and age.  Let\u2019s just buy futures.  \n\nAnd so they go all billionaire ape shit in the public commodity markets buying silver.  And for a while, that seemed smart as fuck because prices went through the fucking roof.  In 1970 when the hunt\u2019s started buying silver, the spot price was $5/oz.\u00a0 By 1979, the price was $55/oz. For a while there, for every dollar increase in the price of silver the Hunts realized a paper profit of $100m.  Fuck.\n\nBy 1979, the Hunt brothers came to own physical bullion and futures contracts equivalent to 77% of the world\u2019s silver.\u00a0\n\nBut it turns out silver isn\u2019t just shiny metal billionaire eye candy.  It\u2019s also a raw material needed to make shit like film and transistors, and the makers of that shit employed a lot of voters.  And so you see where this is going.  Shit is entangled.  When spooky shit happens in Texas, it disturbs all kinds of quantum particles in Washington.  And because entanglement is a two way street, Washington responds. In February, 1980, the new Federal Reserve Chair, Paul Volker, gets with the big exchanges and together they introduce new rules that capped the size of future exposure to 3m ounces (the Hunts had over 40m).\u00a0 Traders had a month to become compliant.\u00a0 Additionally, the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) suspended any new sliver future contracts.\n\nAnd here\u2019s what happened next: in March, 1980, in what became known as \u201cSilver Tuesday\u201d, silver drops to $10.80/oz.\u00a0 Even with bunkers full of the shit, the paper losses on futures negate the Hunt\u2019s bullion holdings and the Hunt brothers are fucked.\n\nBill Gates once observed that \u201cprivate money can take risks in a way that government money often isn\u2019t willing to\u201d.\u00a0 Which is 100% true right up to the point that your ass gets dragged before congress to explain the shit to the rule-makers.  The shit is entangled.  And that\u2019s some quantum money shit you gotta be careful fucking around with.\n", "created_utc": 1554699939, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bapoet/urban_trade_breakdowns_the_hunt_brothers_go_to/", "is_self": true}
