This is going to slow down the constant inflow of big money causing the bid orders to fill raising stocks. \n\n2) 1 Quarter was very good and stocks will struggle to match the previous quarters earnings and gains. We came out of a huge \u201cscare\u201d and now we are heading to all time highs? \ud83d\ude02 \n\n3) Earnings will be coming soon, last earnings most stocks went up on small beats. For example Apple up after a guidance cut and a 0% beat. Look out for more guidance cuts like intel, amd, or amazon. \n\n4) Good News Priced In: stocks have already priced in \u201ctrade talks going well\u201d and \u201ctrade deal close\u201d tweets. Interest rates are already low and the Fed couldn\u2019t b more dovish. All of this good \u201cnews\u201d and now stocks are approaching ATHs. Well did anybody hear about huge layoffs spiked 35%? \n\n5) Global Growth slowing: Look at the Bond markets. The global economy is slowing such as China. (Old news) Germany is having troubles and other countries.\n\n1) Good News: Donald Trump and PPT really don\u2019t want the stock market to drop, so they do everything they can to boost the stock market.  \n\nWhat do you think? \n\n", "created_utc": 1554571525, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ba6ogg/bears_get_ready/", "is_self": true}
