{"id": "giesb5", "title": "$UNFI Short action pushing undervalued stock", "selftext": "Up 20% as I write this...\n\n**Short interest is 19%** (9.6 million shares on 54 million outstanding and \\~1.9 million average volume) which is likely leading to the squeeze we are seeing now but it has great potential long term. \n\nUNFI is the largest publicly-traded grocery distributor in the states. A couple of years ago they had some massive missteps. Chief among them was, in an effort to reduce their reliance on Whole Foods/Amazon, they acquired Supervalue at a crazy price and taking on billions of debt, this acquisition meant they picked up a lot of new clients and reduced Amazons share of their business from 50% to less than 25%. Within a year Wall Street responded to their continuous misses in earnings and they dropped in value over 80%. Their market value going from being in the tens of billions to less than half a billion. \n\nFast-forward a couple of years and things have started to get better (they had their first positive earnings report just a couple months ago!), they\u2019ve created an OK debt repayment plan and started shedding parts of the Supervalue acquisition they do not need. Then they stumble into Covid19 and are now printing money. \n\nThey did incredibly well during the first wave peak of the pandemic, an update in mid- March reporting weeks of Thanksgiving/Christmas level sales. Assuming that continued through March and most of April that is a huge boost for them, with more likely to come if a 2nd wave hits. There is positive sentiment that their June earnings report may be as good if not better than their last positive one. \n\nAs part of their Supervalu acquisition they picked up a ton of grocery stores, they shed some but still had over 80 at last check. During the pandemic while other companies were reducing hours UNFI decided to make most locations **open 24 hours**!\n\n With all that said I hesitated and sold my May 15 $12.50 calls (23 of them) for .15 on Monday....fuck. If I had held I could have sold for \\~$2.70 each today. (-$6,000)\n\nCurrently I am still **holding [June $12.50 Calls \\(15 of them\\)](https://imgur.com/a/jFyyeow) and nearly 1,500 in shares** (this stock used to be worth in the 70s under better times). I plan to exit half of my options if the share price exceeds $20. \n\nSome people have said this would make a good acquisition by Amazon to control the supply chain. In the short term I disagree as UNFI still seems to disorganized for Amazon to take on the mountain of work still needing to be done.\n\nPS- Forget to add that the CEOs partipcation in BMO Capital Markets Hosts Virtual 15th Annual Farm to Market Conference tommorow is also affecting the price. People are hoping he speaks to increased sales over the last two months due to Covid19.", "created_utc": 1589301585.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/giesb5/unfi_short_action_pushing_undervalued_stock/", "is_self": true}
