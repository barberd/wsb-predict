I put on my best pair of denim shorts and asked my mom for a $10 raise on my allowance. She gave me $5, which is enough for the 4 for 4 meal at Wendy\u2019s. \n\nI go to pick Su up but she\u2019s running late. No problem. A women of her caliber can take an extra 5. I put on some more deodorant on my hands because they are soaking wet at this poin. I wonder if Su likes Bowling for Soup. Goddammit what am I, an idiot? OF COURSE she likes Bowling for Soup, she\u2019s perfect. \n\nFuck! It\u2019s been an hour and no Su! Even worse, the gas on my moms car is running low and Wendy\u2019s is gonna close soon. Shit! Maybe if I send her another text... although I sent like 5 already. Ok, just relax designeddeception. Everyone at camp autism said this was 100% and those tards wouldn\u2019t lie to you, they\u2019re the smartest people you know. \n\nOh shit. She stood me up. Su baby! Why? Well I\u2019m still all hot and bothered thinking about some SU juice so I start to wank it but I forget about the deodorant I put on my sweaty hands and now my pp burns. \n\nAnyways, totally got laid, lost my allowance refilling moms car, burned pp... 10/10.", "created_utc": 1578435571, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/elitdq/i_took_lisa_su_out_last_night/", "is_self": true}
