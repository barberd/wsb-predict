{"id": "gs704a", "title": "Next COVID-19 stock: BUD", "selftext": "I'm still working from home, and will be for at least a couple more months - likely through the end of the year. Many other software companies in my area have told their employees to expect to work from home through the end of the year.\n\nYou know what my boss talks about when we chat? Beer. Know what my team does once a week? Virtual social hour, featuring beer. My beer consumption has gone up now that I'm working from home. My boss says his has too. Forbes says off-premise beer sales are up 11.8%: https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrisfurnari/2020/04/30/are-americans-drinking-their-way-through-the-coronavirus-pandemic/#8c586063195c \n\nSo, BUD had some troubles due to hipsters wanting expensive craft beer. To some degree that's still a problem, but I see it shifting for two reasons. One, the craft beer obsession is partly an image thing. Sure, they taste neat, but it also makes you look sophisticated or something. If you are alone at home, who cares? Save the fancy beer for special occasions and drink more swill. Secondly, worries about the economy have people trying to save money. You think all those millions of unemployed people are suddenly sober? Nah, they're just drinking cheap stuff. There's already been a shift towards cheaper alcohol: https://www.just-drinks.com/news/consumers-abandon-alcohol-purchases-as-household-budgets-shrink-research_id130957.aspx\n\nMeanwhile, NASCAR is running races again. You think their fans are drinking IPA's? Restaurants are opening. I have friends and coworkers who will go out to a restaurant with friends, order an appetizer (see, we ordered food! We're just doing restaurant things!), then just buy beers. This hints that the lost sales from bars being closed probably aren't hurting the company as much as they should.\n\nAnyway, I'm kind of a pussy so I have BUD 09/18 $70C. That's a long time line, but it also is after their next earnings date. The stock has already started to move and if I had more free cash I'd buy 06/26 $50C.\n\n[Edit: I don't care much for magic crayons, but BUD does seem to have built strong support. That said, it crashed back in Feb/Mar along with everything else, and it hasn't recovered yet like the rest of the market has. Am I wrong to expect a correction rally? What am I missing?]", "created_utc": 1590675191.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gs704a/next_covid19_stock_bud/", "is_self": true}
