{"id": "h9wui3", "title": "Bond Downgrades", "selftext": "Did some digging and found a few companies with pretty awful financials that have had bonds downgraded recently.  Wanted some thoughts on what you think this could mean for the stock price, whether the Fed buying bonds would affect the stock price, etc.  \n\nAZUL:  On 6/2, Azul Airlines was downgraded to Caa1 from B1 by Moody\u2019s.  Moody\u2019s also downgraded $400M senior unsecured notes issued to Caa2 from B2. (274.5%) EPS this Y, negative profit and operating margins.  \n\nF:  On 3/25, Ford was downgraded to Ba2 from Ba1 by Moody\u2019s.  The ratings were placed under review for further downgrade.  Ford has a notoriously bad balance sheet, with high d/e levels, negative operating and profit margins, and negative ROA, negative ROE, and a sub 1% ROI.  I definitely think they\u2019re a candidate to have their bonds bought by the Fed.", "created_utc": 1592282827.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h9wui3/bond_downgrades/", "is_self": true}
