I didn't expect so much pork in the stimulus after what happened after 2009.\n\nUnless testing for covid 19 goes through the roof and people realize we are in some serious shit then I'm going to bail out.\n\nI believe that shelter in place came way too late, and I think the stimulus bill is going to out weight the impacts of CV this week.\n\nWe likely won't start seeing huge numbers of deaths until next month and maybe ICUs full before the end of next month. That's when the real panic will hit. That is not priced in, but it doesn't help my positions.\n\nI'm interested if anyone sees a way to hedge this position ex post facto rather than just bailing.\n\nHistory:\n\nStarted trading March 3rd. Posted my first couple of wins here $4k and $10k) in spite of morons along me for investing advise in PMs.\n\nI'm a fucking retard gambling with money from my high cash flow. Stop asking me for advice because I'm going to lose a shit load here...\n\nYOLO\n\nEdit: people wanted my full positions\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/ITP9vRG.png", "created_utc": 1585003355.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fntnxl/156k_vxx_60c_327/", "is_self": true}
