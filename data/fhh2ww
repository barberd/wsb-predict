{"id": "fhh2ww", "title": "Wtf is a VIRT", "selftext": "So yesterday I came across a post on here hailing how VIRT will be this magic tendie machine and if I put my faith in it I will own a racetrack by 10am. At least that\u2019s all I got out of it. So of course I threw some money at it cuz autists do what they\u2019re told. Went up like 80%, sweet, racetrack here I come. However today VIRT seems to have fallen off a fucking cliff. Now it\u2019s just bouncing around like a dead cat some kid threw off the roof of his stepdads trailer. Can somebody explain just what the fuck VIRT is? Preferably with like pretty pictures or something.", "created_utc": 1584022940.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhh2ww/wtf_is_a_virt/", "is_self": true}
