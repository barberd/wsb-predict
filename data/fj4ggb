I know a lot of us autists here use RH so maybe someone could explain how this is possible.\n\nInstant deposit accounts without margin are open to potentially unlimited losses. Not in the traditional sense like if you sell a naked call.  (Also I'm using the word unlimited very loosely you will see exactly what I mean if you keep reading)\n\n\\-\n\nExample:  \n\nSay you deposit $500 using instant deposit on robinhood. Margin is turned off because the terms of the agreement set forth by FINRA,  NYSE, and the Federal Reserve Board say 2k is the minimum cash needed for margin accounts.  \n\nYou take that $500 and use it all to do a debit spread. What is your possible max loss? 500?\n\nWrong,  so very very wrong. If your short leg gets exercised and the long can not be closed in time. RH will then turn margin on in your account (even though you do not meet the 2k minimum requirement) and charge you whatever the loss was from the time the short leg got  exercised to when they are able to close the long leg. \n\nThis happening is why literally every other broker requires margin to do any spreads.\n\nMeaning you are potentially open to way more then $500 in losses on a $500 \"cash\" account. \n\n\\-\n\nWhat about when something like this happens to an account with more then the 2k minimum required you may ask. Wouldn't it be ok for them to turn margin on for that account and cover the loss? \n\nHell no, because, there was no maintenance margin since you didn't use margin to buy the spread. Which is also another FINRA requirement. You used your own 2k so robinhood disregards the maintanace. \n\nThis means you have a debit spread on an account with $0 in it because you used all the cash to buy the spread. If it goes sideways like the example above robinhood will turn the margin on and charge you whatever the loss was. How the absolute fuck does that work?\n\n\"Once an investor buys a security on margin, the maintenance margin goes into  effect with FINRA requiring that at least 25% of the total market value  of the securities be in the account at all times. Still, many brokers  can require more as stipulated in the margin agreement.\n\nIf  the equity in a margin account falls below the maintenance margin, the  broker issues a margin call,\u00a0which requires that the investor deposit  more cash into the margin account bring the level of funds up to the  maintenance margin or liquidate securities in order to fulfill the  maintenance amount. The broker reserves the right to sell the securities  in a margin account, sometimes without consulting the investor, to meet  the maintenance margin.\"\n\nThey are  letting you do this spread without the maintenance or Minimum cash requirements to even get margin. How the is this legal? I have been seeing a steady stream of posts in multiple  different subs about people being screwed over by this and having no  idea how their $200 account now owes 15k in margin and so on.\n\nCan anyone please explain maybe I am missing something major and this is just a shit post i dunno", "created_utc": 1584291651.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fj4ggb/we_know_rh_is_sketchy_but_how_is_this_legal_at_all/", "is_self": true}
