Yes, the Asian countries are freaking killing it with their coronavirus containment while the Western countries are getting wrecked. This isn't just because of time lag, Italy and Korea had their cluster explosions at the same time and right now Korea is down to 84 and Italy is at 3526 with almost an 8% death rate. Asia has better testing, better tracking, more and earlier quarantines, a less YOLO populace who were wearing surgical masks for fashion even before COVID19, and preparedness from previous experience with SARS. If this trend continues, Asia will successfully wipe out corona while it ravages the Western economies for months to come, and they'll be the ones banning travel from the West to prevent re-infection.\n\nWhile puts have been printing money and probably will continue to do so for at least a couple more weeks, at some point sentiment will turn and those holding them will get wiped out. To prevent this from happening, I think it is a good idea to hedge positions with calls on Asian countries who will see their economies rebound due to successful coronavirus containment. If the timing is right, the hedge itself can actually make tendies if Asia stocks go up while Western stocks go down.\n\nWould not recommend buying a broad Asia ETF because these tend to be massively overweight Japan. Instead it's probably a better idea to buy individual ETF call options: MCHI (China), EWY (South Korea), EWS (Singapore), INDA (India), EWJ (Japan)", "created_utc": 1584481033.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkdmcj/hedge_your_spy_puts_with_asia_etf_calls/", "is_self": true}
