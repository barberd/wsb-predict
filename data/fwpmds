Well the other half of comments scoff at bears for thinking rona is bigger than it actually is and that's becoming true, things are improving slowly with social distancing.\n\nSo to my point, if the market is rational because the  downward driver of rona is lessening, shouldn't these retracement TA's have some validity to them? The TA is based off real numbers and real trends, and if rona is rational and not the entirely unpredictable occurance bears want it to be, shouldn't the retracements be on schedule? \n\nI'm failing to see how bulls see this activity as perfectly reasonable and yet all analytical approaches to the data fall flat.\n\nSPY 220p 5/15", "created_utc": 1586283628.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fwpmds/tas_are_still_rational_for_the_same_reason_the/", "is_self": true}
