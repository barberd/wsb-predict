{"id": "fcgut8", "title": "RobinHOLD - Class Action Tendies", "selftext": "Ok retards, Robinhold has fucked us into having DIAMOND HANDS and holding our positions while their IT staff is busy jerking each other off and not fixing the problem. \n\nAs a result of Robinhold\u2019s rampant homosexuality, we all have lost, or potentially lost, hella tendies. \n\nSo here\u2019s my proposal: a class action lawsuit. \n\nSince u/WSBGod loves us so much and has too many tendies to count, I\u2019m sure he\u2019d bankroll a legal team to sue Robinhold to recuperate our lost gainz. Unlike the infinite money glitch, us autists aren\u2019t at fault this time and instead can place the entirety of the fault on Robinhold. \n\nWith enough support, this LITERALLY CANNOT GO TITS UP. This is the type of exploit u/1ORNYMAN dreamed of. \n\nRetards rise up! See you boys in court.", "created_utc": 1583175130, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fcgut8/robinhold_class_action_tendies/", "is_self": true}
