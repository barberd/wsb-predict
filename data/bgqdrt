They know infinitely more than I do, and  has way more experience. I can totally be wrong about virtually everything, so if anything inverse everything I say. Actually don't do that, in case I'm accidentally correct. Believe me, my username checks out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd also like to state that entries and exists are everything. \"2 elite traders can go $LONG and $SHORT on the same stock and still make profits\" - paraphrased Alexander Elder. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\##Don't do anything based on what I say. I'm serious. Please Don't. \n\nThis only exists because I can't find a decent trading journal. Especially one that would remind me to check whether or not I was right. I plan on developing the application (unless one of you guys want to do it, Not like I give a fuck.) after I finish up my finals and stuff. This is a pretty decent replacement in the meantime. \n\nOkay So let's do this. \n\n\\##Current State of Markets \n\nTo be honest, there are only a few things that i think \\_really\\_ matters right now. \n\nSo, firstly, the S&amp;P 500 has reached it all time highest  of $2,933.68. Same goes for the NASDAQ Index.  \n\nThe US is currently attempting to stop all countries from purchasing oil from Iran- with China being the only one that's still doing so. The deal was set a while back and countries had been given an amount of time to determine an alternative. \n\nWe are currently in Earnings Season's and the defense sector has won out quite a bit. The health sector is being influenced by our hopeful socialist candidate. $UNH was a fantastic play these last few days. \n\nThis is not important, but it proves you guys suck: $SNAP beat ER. So yeah. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\##Technical Analysis and Stock Picks\n\n\\*\\*$SPY- (Bullish Uptrend)\\*\\*\n\nSo obviously it's returning back to it's previous highs and intends on holding above it. The volume didn't break even the average, so I not very confident in it. It hasn't consolidated yet, so there is a potential for tomorrow to be a red day (not 100% on this). Since $SPY is riding the 6 and 12 day EMAs, it's pretty solid trend. The lack of consolidation and the fact that the RSI has crossed into overbought (keep in mind, stocks and ETFs are capable of continuing above 70% for a while- but we usually see a pullback. So its possible to expect that tomorrow. \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/5x2bp0iks4u21.png\n\nThis isn't any particular pattern as far as I am aware, but I've definitely seen this happen a few times with stocks before and it acts as an ascending wedge. \\*It could fall back.\\*\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/sxvdnm0as4u21.png\n\n\\*\\*$AAPL- (Bullish)\\*\\*\n\nI called the bull run on Apple around March 20th and i still see it happening.\n\nApple has ER in about a week, and a shit ton of ground to cover. Many stocks have to recover back before the Q4 bear run. Including $AMZN and this boi. This stock definitely feels like it can potentially rise back to around $230, If the ER is solid it'll probably be the catalyst that we need push up past the $210 resistance. \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/suesyhqjv4u21.png\n\nThe cross on the RSI, isn't necessarily the cause for concern, but we should anticipate that we'll lose some momentum which is why you don't \\*BUY FDs ON SWINGS.\\* \n\n I swung this for a few days and made a decent percentage with minimal downside. It works (mostly). I'll probably get in and out through the rest of the week. \n\n\\*UNH- Bullish\\* \n\nThis stock is a paint point for me because I was in a Puts play in it when it was about $1.50. I pussied out and watched this bastard climb it's way to $11.00. But its a good play. It's recovering from a major market over reaction to the ER and the Bernie Sanders Medicare-for-all. \n\nI really like the options on this stock and they are powerful on solid moves. \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/zhplvkalx4u21.png\n\n\n\n The DMI+ is pushing upward while the - is downward with a stronger ADX. With the MACD is also recovering. And the Weekly bottom candle is (kind of) a Doji. With this week being a confirmation- thus far. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/tz5gsf1205u21.png\n\nI'd wait for it to break 232. It may try to fill a gap up to 234, which isnt that big, but gives it an official bull trend which is a good thing for calls as it'll break the 12 day EMA.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Amazon (AMZN)- Bullish \\*\\* \n\nI definitely think I could confidently $LONG this stock up to 2000. It's just how $AMZN moves sometimes. May see some resistance around 1967. And probably 1950 since that's just how it does things. \n\nNot going to bother with a chart here. \n\nI am concerned though, because I've been seeing a bearish divergence so It may reverese sometime soon, pretty strongly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Boeing (BA) -sidways until it crosses 384\\*\\* \n\nTheir ER is tomorrow morning. So basically I anticipate that they won't be down on revenue because the MAX 8 weren't discontinued till the end of the quarter. HOWEVER, we will definitely see them lowering their guidance for obvious reasons.\n\nSo the open gap from a bit ago has some room to fill. We have a support level at $363. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/v5ayc3y125u21.png\n\nIf the ER has a bullish sentiment behind it- then you can anticipate a large move. Probably to 378 or 380, depending on the open.  \n\nVolume Drop-off is because of ER so expect some interesting volatility tomorrow. (I can't really speak to how much, yet) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\##I'm tired as fuck and have other shit to do now, so I'll just post the rest of my notes and update this later. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*ROKU\\*\\* \n\n on the weekly is a double top, reaching its bottom, as well as on the daily a major break through a major support . \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*JNJ\\*\\*\n\nGood guidance in ER but a strong 140 resistance. (this note is from quite a bit ago.) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*QCOM\\*\\*\n\n (also from about a week ago after the lawsuit ended) \n\nInsane Move, Outlook on this should be put side\n\n(STRONG) 76.5 Level, Most recent Highest High, High Vol Break Down for Trade\n\n(IDK) 81.23 Level, Got it in the last 5 Years, Was previous High at that Time, Pre-market seems to hit that Level\n\n(IDK) 78.38 Level, Bottom of that range from this level to 81.23, could act as \"support\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\##Final Notes: \n\nI did notice that most if not all of my plays are $LONG. This is either because I'm wrong, or the market it bullish, idiot. But seriously, some of these have intraday shorts that you'll want be on the look out for if you scalp at all. Otherwise, wait for confirmation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome of these plays can be weighted by the whole market or sector depending on how everything goes. If you see $SPY jump up $10 or some bullshit like that, expect the same for most of the tech stocks. We're at a very interesting point in the market in my opinion and at this point it's anyone's game. We could continue to rally or all of the newbies entering the market will get mega-fucked and time will tell. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI haven't entirely determined how I'll format these, but i will probably try to keep it up because if I don't I'll have an autistic fit and just buy a bunch of Macy's calls.", "created_utc": 1556080505, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bgqdrt/technical_analysis_and_stock_picks_april_23_2019/", "is_self": true}
