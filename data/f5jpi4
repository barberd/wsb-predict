{"id": "f5jpi4", "title": "Spotify Network Effect", "selftext": "Listen up Spotify is here to stay. Its network effect is massive at this point. Look at Facebook, realistically, it's a POS service, but everyone uses it because they need it for something. I would delete my Facebook if I didn't need it for group projects and other shit for school. Even beyond that, they've still got me by the balls with Instagram. Don't see that going away anytime soon, everyone is addicted to the dopamine from likes and comments and shit, guys be looking at all these model igs, sliding into dms, these insta hoes are using it to move their fashion products and shit, people selling drugs on IG, fake jays, darts that fell of a truck, you name it. Anyway what does this have to do with Spotify? The fucking network effect. Everyone is using spotify, they already have their playlists on there, their friends playlists, the recommendations are in a whole nother ball park compared to other streaming services. I look at the fundamentals and they are garbage. Shit ROC, over inflated market cap for a company that still loses money even though it has a huge chunk of the market. \n\nThen I remember:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSTONKS ONLY GO UP\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNumbers don't fucking mean anything in this market. They poured money into advertisement to get to a dominant position in the market. Now they can forget about wasting money on advertisement, increase margins and once they break a profit this shit is going to the moon. Plus coronavirus immunity since people will sit at home all day and listen to fucking Spotify. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong story short, buy LEAPs on this shit, don't try to guess what the fuck is happening in the short term you'll get burned. Patience is how you make money, so don't buy contracts expiring tomorrow if you're gonna cry about it like a little bitch and call a fucking -0.5% dip the great fucking depression.", "created_utc": 1581989811, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f5jpi4/spotify_network_effect/", "is_self": true}
