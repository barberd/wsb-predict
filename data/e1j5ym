Spend atleast 24 hours total reading this sub, and have never laughed that good so much in a long time.\n\nThought why would you ever waste your money. However slowly i got infected with the WSB spirit.   \nI then figured that since i am only 22 and 1400 is peanuts compared to what you tards have wasted, i should give it a shot.\n\nI also reasoned that if i buy options i might waste it all in one strike so that it hurts so much that i will never do it again.\n\nThis i combined with my disgust for all the TSLA fanboy suckers and the release of the trashcan, and there you go for my full retard otm 29/9 expiration TESLA Puts. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy did i just do that.  \nIt was like i did it automatically.
