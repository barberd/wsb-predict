Buying $Rope because almost all their gains from the last 4 years have been erased.\n\nThose bulls have hands like shredded cheese from catching all those knives. And don't even get me started on the retards who bought calls and held for more than a day.\n\nYeah, you have people freaking out, but the virus has barely impacted the US.  \nSome increased unemployment, but most states have people working normally. Economy more or less still functioning.\n\nNow look at motherfucking Europe.  \nLast week basically all their shit was open, flights running, borders open.  \nNow most countries have closed their borders, limited flights, shut down any non-essential businesses, and imposed a policy of self isolation on the populace.  \nInfections skyrockets. Deaths skyrockets.  \nAnd apparently, this isn't even the peak for Europe, which is due in a week or two.\n\nMy final point, and TL:DR  \nDon't expect any crazy drops like $DIS 40, or DJ 10K. Aint gonna happen.  \nBut no way are we at the bottom.\n\nFine, you cucks want more Tickers and Strike?  \nI'm pretty cautious and prefer to go for sure things, rather than 10 baggers.  \nApril 17th Puts:  \n$DIS 80 (Fuck you mouse, I'll see you burn.)  \n$SPY 210  \n$BA 90  \n$IMAX 8.  \n$DAX 7800  \n$VOW3 80", "created_utc": 1584640957.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flejm0/want_to_know_how_bad_things_can_get_in_a_single/", "is_self": true}
