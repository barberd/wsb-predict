{"id": "fspzt8", "title": "Only 10% of equity trading volume comes from discretionary traders", "selftext": "According to JPMorgan (from about 3 years ago) only 10% of of trading volume is from discretionary equity traders. About 50% of volume or so comes from high-frequency trading and a large chunk comes from passively managed funds and ETFs. Basically my conclusion is we're all fucked because the market doesn't reflect prices that aggregate investor opinions anymore. It's just bots doing whatever the fuck they do. You'd think all the bad news last week and this week would cause the market to go down, but nope, it's up. I get that the Fed is propping up the market, I'm not saying there's not other factors, and the market has always been irrational. But don't believe the market is based on investor sentiment anymore. It is a long-term random walk with a drift dictated by algo trading and passively managed funds.\n\nAlso yes I was a gay bear last week, got my ass clapped, and am now just selling premium since vol is so high", "created_utc": 1585704899.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fspzt8/only_10_of_equity_trading_volume_comes_from/", "is_self": true}
