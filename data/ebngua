{"id": "ebngua", "title": "$HUYA and $DOYU, e-sports plays that aren't really worth it", "selftext": "**HUYA and DOYU**\n\n**Price:** 17.38\n\nMost of you know about HUYA (as well as DOYU).  It's a live-streaming service which focuses on e-sports.  There has been some diversification in its business strategy this year into other non e-sports related content as well but they haven't taken off as much.\n\nHUYA also launched into global markets starting with South America (Brazil).  The service though is not called HUYA and instead called NimoTV.  The reaction to this has been quite lackluster.  If you go to https://www.nimo.tv, you will see hardly any users watching at all hours of the day (usually between 0-10 viewers per stream).  This tells me that their global strategy is FAILING.\n\nAs for the HUYA service itself (which is only in China), they do have a decent amount of users.  They claim over 100 million MAU (monthly active users).  This is compared to Twitch which boasts 15 million DAILY active users.  HUYA also pays an obscene amount of money to retain popular streamers on multi-year contracts.  HUYA makes money mainly from viewers buying \"gifts\" for streamers (and HUYA takes a small cut).\n\nThe threat here isn't Twitch, or tariffs, or even the companies financials (which are actually fantastic).  It's actually all from the local Chinese competition (most American idiots here on WSB or North America don't know anything about China and only read what they can from SEC filings which is retarded).  If you had actually lived in China day-to-day, you would know that HUYA (and also DOYU) are sub-tier e-sports streaming platforms in terms of active users.  The real monster competition (which most autistic Americans don't know about) is a little (actually, huge) service called Kuaishou.  They claim DAILY active users of... wait for it... 200 MILLION.  That destroys the Made-in-USA Twitch and the Made-in-China HUYA and DOYU numbers.\n\nIn addition to this competition which clearly trumps HUYA and DOYU, Kuaishou is also currently in pre-IPO stages (with planned IPO in 2020).  They already have... wait for it... $25 BILLION in pre-IPO valuation.  That is more than your American autistic IPOs of SDC, PTON, DDOG, and NET COMBINED.  And in that $25 BILLION IPO lies an investment by Tencent holdings themselves of at LEAST $2 BILLION which is more than what they invested in HUYA and DOYU COMBINED (yes, Tencent invested in all 3 streaming services and holds nearly a double digit percentage stake in all 3).\n\nTencent is also combining their HUYA and DOYU investments into a single umbrella investment to keep the shareholders of Kuaishou \"happy\".  You obviously don't want to invest in a company as well as its competitors from a professional standpoint as that would be a conflict of interest.\n\nThis tells me that Tencent is likely going to either WRITE OFF their HUYA and DOYU failed investments or merge them into a single company.  You can see from the share price to date that it's pretty much a flop.  Both companies have 0 catalyst as Kuaishou has pretty much taken almost all their customers (all that's left in HUYA and DOYU are streamers that are bound to multi-year contracts as well as their otaku fat-fuck autistic fans).\n\nPrice target for HUYA, $9 and $DOYU, $4.  Those would be more reasonable targets given their likely loss of customers over the next year by Kuaishou.  Also, there is other competition like Bilibili (as well as 3 other major ones in China that no one outside of China has heard of) which I won't get into but those are other reasons that HUYA and DOYU stand NO CHANCE. \n\nRemember, just because you only know of HUYA and DOYU as THE streaming platforms in China doesn't mean you're right.  You don't live in China and not everything there makes it to North America so you autists aren't going to be privy to what's actually going on there.  And what's going on there right now in the streaming scene is that HUYA and DOYU are shit-tier streaming services being overtaken by Kuaishou and others.\n\nPS: If you feel attacked by this DD, then you're obviously long either HUYA and DOYU and deserve to lose money like an autistic fag.", "created_utc": 1576540410, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ebngua/huya_and_doyu_esports_plays_that_arent_really/", "is_self": true}
