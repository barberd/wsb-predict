TL;DR- Auto plants shut down for a few months and will take a few more to get back up and running and actually get cars sent to dealers. This is absolutely fucking new car sales as we don't actually have the units to sell to people. \n\nWhen auto manufacturers ceased production at their factories, those vehicles actually stopped showing up at showrooms. I work BDC/sales at a large corporate Japanese manufacturer, and we are starting to really get hurt by this shutdown. Even with the pandemic, people are buying cars right now, we just had a really good May, and we are seeing massive traffic this month. Unfortunately, I am running out of units to sell to these people. I am losing sales due to the fact that I both don't have enough units, and I don't have the right ones. From what I am hearing, other manufacturers are having the same issues, and it is even worse with domestics. Look at used car auctions right now, prices are up 15-20% in the last couple of months as dealers try to make up for the lack of new units coming in.\n\nBasically manufacturers are double fucked by this because even though market confidence is coming back, they can't give buyers new units, and they are losing these buyers to the used market. \n\nLinks because fuck people that don't use sources\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2020/06/05/cars/car-dealerships-low-inventories/index.html\n\nhttps://www.cars.com/articles/as-new-car-inventory-shrinks-whats-left-on-dealer-lots-to-buy-422507/\n\nhttps://www.toledoblade.com/business/automotive/2020/06/10/Cars-selling-but-inventories-depleted/stories/20200609113\n\nI hold no short positions in the auto market right now, but if I did F 7/10 6P", "created_utc": 1591860666.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h0ui64/dd_from_the_auto_lot/", "is_self": true}
