Investing only in ETFs, DCA and keeping it calm. You can't win. This market is such a joke and all fundamentals and DD are out the window. You need to be an insider or just gamble to make money. Nothing is rational P/E? Cash? Overhead? Debts? Brrrr? Nothing matters. It is just pure luck. \n\nPeople just don't care, they forget about forest fires, hurricanes, riots, virus etc. Seriously if a bomb detonates tomorrow SPY will go to 400 because there will be so much rebuilding to be done. If all rivers go dry then SPY goes to 500 because Nestle will be selling bottled water for 100 a pop. \n\nI learnt my lesson. I will never again time the market.", "created_utc": 1591365718.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gx54sz/gay_bear_throwing_the_towel/", "is_self": true}
