The only problem was that I didn't have a sound strategy. \n\nFast forward to Sunday, January 12th. I was hungover as fuck and needed some food. I drove to my local McDonald's and asked for the best thing on the menu - the bacon, egg &amp; cheese biscuit. The teller then relays to me that they were out of biscuits that morning. That told me 3 things: \n\n1. Americans are still fat as shit and that's not changing any time soon. We have no problem consuming copious amounts of calories in the morning. Product demand = solid.\n2. If my sample size of 1 is correct, that means that this is happening elsewhere. Lots of orders going to corporate demanding more biscuit inventory. Jobs = created.\n3. I now needed to order something else - probably something more expensive to compensate for the loss and disappointment I was feeling. Just like that they sucked more money out of me. Profit = maximized.\n\nI left the parking lot with the hunch that McDonald's is a subtle juggernaut from a business fundamentals perspective. Ever since that day I have yolo'd a size-able portion of my biweekly paycheck into $MCD after checking biscuit availability at various locations. So far it's can't-lose as MCD is up around 6% on the year. Corona virus has had no(!!!) impact this far. \n\nDo with this information what you will. Felt like I had to share it here with people who will actually fucking listen.
