{"id": "fln4k5", "title": "OHI", "selftext": "OHI is a senior living REIT that paid a 14.9% dividend last quarter. Idk jack shit about senior living but that dividend makes no sense without major risk. Someone is majorly bullish on this - Stock is up 50% today only, but still down 49% over last month. Senior living will not do well with all the old folks dying, sad to say. Earnings on may 5 should be a bloodbath.  \n\n\nIf you want some gey dd:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/91mn7t/omega\\_healthcare\\_investors\\_ohi/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/91mn7t/omega_healthcare_investors_ohi/)   \n\n\ntldr OHI 6/19 12p", "created_utc": 1584671722.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fln4k5/ohi/", "is_self": true}
