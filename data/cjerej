{"id": "cjerej", "title": "(DD)Why The Cheesecake Factory $CAKE is due for a 30% + haircut this upcoming earnings.", "selftext": "\nAfter successfully calling the biggest drop in Facebook history last year and [turning 1k into 20k](https://i.imgur.com/6TKgwjF.jpg) I have been researching popular companies trying to find ones that are due for a huge haircut, and after making a visit to the Cheesecake factory and seeing almost nobody there in a very popular location it peaked my interest to dig deeper and do some more research. Here is what I found.\n\n\n\nSales: Unless your name is Chipotle, all restaurants in the sector have been declining, take a look at what happened with Dave and Buster's $PLAY A very similar market cap along with an identical user clientele dropped 20% on earnings. Over the past 10 years sales have been stagnant.\n\n\nDebt: As of January 2019 cheesecake factory has 571m of assets on 743m of liabilities.\n\n\nEPS: while not a big deal for a lot of companies $cake has had a negative return on equity for a very long time and investors have gave them a pass but in today's market this continued EPS loss I believe will catch up with them.\n\n\nPlanned acquisitions: The Cheesecake Factory\u00a0is looking to acquire the North Italia casual chain from Fox Restaurants during the second half of 2019. I believe they will make this announcement with this earnings release. Acquisitions are never a good look for a company, not being able to increase core  revenues and overpaying for a small niche chain will make investors run for the hills. Also they announced during the 1st quarter that they lost 1.5m in their initial funding round for high start-up costs for North Italia expect these to increase\n\n\nNew accounting standards: I believe something fishy is going on over at the Cheesecake factory in regards to how they account for their operating leases. $CAKE does not account for leases in its invested capital calculation, which explains why the company claims it earned a\u00a014% ROIC\u00a0in 2018 when  it really earned an 8% ROIC. Companies will soon be required to account for operating leases on the balance sheet. When that new rule comes into effect, $CAKE will have to make a choice: Either change its calculation to ignore lease assets on the balance sheet or admit that it is not as profitable as it has claimed.\n\nAlso to add a personal anecdote, I went there with my family to a very nice location and it was practically empty. I don't see how they are making money at all with increased food and\n labor costs. A 2b dollar valuation is way overvalued for 24m of revenue.\n\n[financials chart](https://i.imgur.com/0gTytqI.jpg)", "created_utc": 1564422813, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cjerej/ddwhy_the_cheesecake_factory_cake_is_due_for_a_30/", "is_self": true}
