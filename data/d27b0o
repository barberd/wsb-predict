{"id": "d27b0o", "title": "Morning Briefing (9/10/2019)", "selftext": "# Little movement in front of big events\n\nThe S&amp;P 500 futures trade six points, or 0.2%, below fair value after a flat day yesterday. Some consolidation appears to be taking shape after a recent stretch of gains, while the market awaits some key events later this week.\n\nFor the moment, the narrative in the market's mind is that U.S. consumer spending could continue to support growth and that trade tensions with China may not escalate before their trade talks in October. China's Premier Li Kegiang reportedly repeated Beijing's willingness to make trade progress.\n\nAt the same time, the market is holding steady in front of an ECB policy decision on Thursday and the Retail Sales Report for August on Friday, which could alter the market's assumptions about growth. Today, though, many investors will tune in to\u00a0**Apple's**\u00a0(**AAPL** 213.73, -0.44, -0.2%) annual product event at 1:00 p.m. ET, where it is expected to unveil its latest iPhone.\u00a0\n\nIn economic data, investors will receive the JOLTS - Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey for July at 10:00 a.m. ET. The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August declined to 103.1 from 104.7 in July.\n\nU.S. Treasuries are slightly lower, nudging yields higher. The 2-yr yield is up two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is up two basis points to 1.64%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.2% to 98.45. WTI crude is up 1.0% to $58.42/bbl, which could continue to benefit the oil-sensitive energy stocks that have bounced back this month.\u00a0\n\nIn U.S. Corporate news:\n\n* **Apple**\u00a0(AAPL 213.73, -0.44): -0.2% ahead of its annual Special Event at 1:00 p.m. ET.\u00a0\n* **Wendy's**\u00a0(WEN 20.00, -1.95): -8.9% after lowering its earnings guidance to reflect costs incurred to launch a breakfast menu in 2020.\u00a0\n* **Ford Motor** (F 9.19, -0.35): -3.7% after Moody's downgraded its senior unsecured rating to Ba1, or \"junk rating,\" from Baa3.\u00a0\n\nReviewing overnight developments:\n\n* Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region ended Tuesday on a mixed note.\u00a0Japan's Nikkei +0.4%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng UNCH, China's Shanghai Composite -0.1%, India's Sensex Closed for Moharram, South Korea's Kospi +0.6%, Australia's ASX All Ordinaries -0.5%.\n   * In economic data:\n      * China's August CPI +0.7% m/m (expected 0.5%; last 0.4%); +2.8% yr/yr (expected 2.6%; last 2.8%).
