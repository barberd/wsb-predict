{"id": "fw5xrj", "title": "Precision, Recall and Survivorship Bias: Why you should be more skeptical of those who correctly predicted crashes", "selftext": "In data science, two of the most popular metrics to assess accuracy are precision and recall\n\nWhen making a prediction regarding the outcome of a binary event (let's say market crash), there are four possibilities:\n\nTrue positive - Market crash is predicted, Market crash happens\n\nFalse positive - Market crash is predicted, Market crash does NOT happen\n\nTrue negative - Market crash is NOT predicted, Market crash does NOT happen\n\nFalse negative - Market crash is NOT predicted, Market crash happens\n\n**Precision** is the fraction of true positives to the total number of positives: **out of all the market crashes predicted, how many of those actually came to pass?**\n\n**Recall** is the fraction of true positives to the total number of crashes (true positive plus false negative): **out of all the market crashes that happened, how many were predicted beforehand?**\n\nThe way a lot of people gauge accuracy is simply by looking at recall.  They seem the market crashes, and then look to see who predicted it in advance.  The problem is that it is fairly easy to achieve a recall rate of 100%: simply make somewhat vague predictions of market crashes and collapse constantly, and whenever one happens, you will be among the ones that \"predicted\" it.  Just looking at recall doesn't mean jack shit without also looking at precision: what percentage of market crash predictions actually came true?  \n\nThis is very similar to the problem of survivorship bias: **Doom and gloom predictions that come true are far more visible than the many, many others that were wrong.**  You cannot judge someone's accuracy without looking at the complete list of their predictions in addition to knowing all the times that the market has crashed.\n\nThe result is that someone makes a prediction, gets it right, and people who then blindly follow that person's advice because they judge accuracy solely on recall and ignores precision, is led to the slaughter.  **For example, how do you see the full exhaustive list of predictions made by someone whose reddit account is only 3 weeks old?  YOU CAN'T!**", "created_utc": 1586203597.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fw5xrj/precision_recall_and_survivorship_bias_why_you/", "is_self": true}
