The first image shows me trying to guess the top of the market writing calls on some stocks/spy like I said last week (screenshot was after already I closed the spy calls for a 1.5k loss). The second shows me perfectly timing the top of PINS by writing puts when it was $21.70. I was fine being assigned on Pinterest at the beginning of the week (especially with everyone bored at home) but the CEO could not have made the earnings call any more depressing. I took the loss in a panic just to watch it rise all week. Hopefully I don\u2019t forget this lesson. My account is still up huge for the year but this week was definitely a kick in the nuts.\n\nThis market is officially trading on hard more. Let me know what options you are writing this week. \n\nEveryone loves loss porn: https://i.imgur.com/kmzKIRf.png https://i.imgur.com/SFfiJMp.png \n\nTotal loss is 6k, which includes all the profit for the week.", "created_utc": 1589126594.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gh43m1/weekly_theta_gang_thread/", "is_self": true}
