Do some superficial anaylsis a few days before earnings , maybe one hour but no more than the average Joe.\n\nA good recent example of this is Amazon. Everyone is at home ordering online, should be a huge revenue increase, this is simple and most people will agree. Then bet AGAINST this simple analysis.\n\n\nBasically I have found the more obvious and popular something is the more like it is to fail so just bet against it every time and over time you will be sure to be ahead. The reason you don't want to do more anaylsis than the average Joe is that they are only spending a small amount of time themselves so you want to replicate this and bet against the herd.", "created_utc": 1588796426.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gerpdu/this_trading_tactic_will_save_you_years_of/", "is_self": true}
