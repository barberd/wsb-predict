{"id": "fn5mhs", "title": "A lesson in EM", "selftext": "Take this post however you want but this is mainly a lesson for those who still think the sky is falling.\n\nQuick background:\n1. I studied Emergency management\n2. Extensive FEMA training in disaster response\n3. I\u2019ve had a hand in managing over 15 natural and man made disasters (think hurricanes, tornados, Ebola outbreak)\n\nFEMA FOR DUMMIES:\n\n\tAnyone who has been watching the news has seen that Trump has been talking with FEMA on how to help stop the spread of Corona Virus. Most of FEMA\u2019s fame comes from their natural disaster response (or lack thereof). One of FEMA\u2019s greatest abilities is planning, and when I say they plan for everything I mean EVERYTHING. The key to disaster response is to have a plan BEFORE disaster happens. These emergency response plans are written down, reviewed, and tested over and over. Emergency managers do this because they know that when shit hits the fan people panic and if there is already a plan for when shit starts going sideways then its easier to calm down and overcome the problem. Besides FEMA and the FAA the Federal government is very inefficient and about as fast as old people fuckin. After 9/11 FEMA really kicked their ass into high gear and designed a management system that can be scaled to any size and type event, I personally know a local emergency manager who used this system to plan and coordinate his daughters wedding, the same system that helps local, state, and federal governments respond to disaster such as super storm Sandy and hurricane Katrina, its that\u2019s flexible and efficient. These systems are called the [Incident Command System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incident_Command_System) and [National Incident Management System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Incident_Management_System) and are used to respond to any disaster anywhere at anytime. Fun fact: some of you might already know this but [the IRS even has a plan for collecting taxes after a nuclear war.](https://dcdirtylaundry.com/yes-the-irs-has-an-emergency-apocalypse-plan-to-collect-taxes/)\n\n\tNow everyone thinks that trump is in charge and he\u2019s the one running this show, and on paper he is. However William Brockmann Long is really the HMFIC running this show. Billy is the one who is fundamentally in charge of making sure the United States has a plan to respond to any type of disaster. Trump might be the one saying \u201cI\u2019m doing X about Y\u201d but really its FEMA who is calling the shots and advising the president, Trump is just pulling the trigger. So no matter how much of a babbling ape headed buffoon you think trump is its doesn\u2019t matter because there is a whole team of level headed people behind him who\u2019s one and only job is to manage emergencies.\n\nHOW THIS RELATES TO THE ECONOMY:\n\n\t\tRemember when I said FEMA is efficient as Fuck? Well most companies on the SPX are big enough to understand that large scale disasters have the ability to extremely fuck up their business. That\u2019s why most large corporations have emergency disaster plans, much like FEMA\u2019s, written down in advance incase anything happens. Walmart has an entire [Emergency Operations Center](https://www.ecu.edu/cs-cas/hazards/upload/Walmart-Resliency_052316_v2.pdf) that runs 25/8 and its main job is to be on the look out and respond to emergencies that directly impact their company. Most major companies have departments like this model after NIMS and ICS. Here are some examples: [Disney emergency manager job posting](https://jobs.livecareer.com/l/crisis-management-planning-program-manager-disney-cac507473de325204963b6fc39139e51), [PPT presentation on Boeing\u2019s emergency management system](https://ndiastorage.blob.core.usgovcloudapi.net/ndia/2009/DIBCIP/Komendat.pdf), and [Amazon job posting for Emergency Management Director ](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/pm-emergency-response-and-business-continuity-at-amazon-1509562192)\n\n\tSo while investors might not have \u201cpriced in\u201d the effects of this global disaster I can guarantee you almost every company on the SPX did, and they have a plan to overcome it. We already are seeing news articles about car companies repurposing their factories to make ventilators and cruise companies offering their ships to help house patients. While the general public might not have had a plan for a fast sweeping indiscriminate plague sized case of beer aids, I am willing to bet my entire life savings (<$50,000) on the fact that every major company out there has a binder on a shelf somewhere with a section in it detailing how the company should respond to a pandemic in order to mitigate any negative effects.\n\n\tSo while the investors might not have priced in the beer aids and stock fell like a fat bitch during an earthquake, most companies are well ahead of the curve. Majority of you will hate to hear this, but were close to the bottom. Give it one month and everything will be very close to being back to normal. Sure GDP might fall and a few smaller companies that weren\u2019t prepared for a disaster will go under but in one months time there will be no reason for stock prices to continue to be falling.\n\nTL;DR: FEMA, DIS, WMT, et al. have priced in beer aids. Stonks only go up until they don\u2019t, and the IRS will still taxes those gains after a nuke.\n\nPOS: SPY 3/23 $231/$232c, UUP 3/27 $28c DAL 4/17 $35c, CCL 4/17 $42.5c, F 6/19 $4p, TAK 7/17 $22.5c, GM 1/21 $47c", "created_utc": 1584905719.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fn5mhs/a_lesson_in_em/", "is_self": true}
