In the process of changing their CEO they will be without one for like 3 weeks which shouldn\u2019t have a huge impact but still... also they won\u2019t be bought by Constellation because they apparently also use WSB and don\u2019t have the cash. Thinking put db spreads for 12/20 or just puts for early next year... what are your thoughts?", "created_utc": 1576066232, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e96b34/5_min_dd_on_cgc/", "is_self": true}
