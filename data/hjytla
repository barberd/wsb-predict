{"id": "hjytla", "title": "Need help - YOLO back to my all time high a month ago after a devastating trade, keep my wife", "selftext": "I'm going to start with the TL:DR because most of you are on the spectrum. My wife said she'd leave her boyfriend if I showed her 300K in the bank. A month ago I got close and I told her I just had one more play left and she could kiss Daryl goodbye for good.\n\nWell, because I'm one of you I damn near yolo'd Linda's get home fund away. My phone is low on minutes but we talked last night and she said she's giving me until the end of July to get my shit together, otherwise Daryl's van is full of gas and she says they are going away for good. I can't stand the thought of having to raise our cool cats and kittens alone.\n\n\n[LOSS: The last 30 days I've been looking for a good deal on $ROPE\n](https://i.imgur.com/C8YXbFp.png)\n\nI've actually had a good year and was really looking forward to Linda moving back in and us rekindling our love. **Big wins** have been HAL 1/15/21 12.5C, HAL 1/15/21 15C, ALK 1/15/21 50C, DIS 10/16/20 110C, OAS 1/15/21 1C. Others trades were TSLA, BA, MRO, TAP, RCL, PCG, CRM, MGM, LUV, TPC, MRNA, BUD, XOM, PAGP, PAA, MPLX (sorta tanker gang), F. **Biggest realized losers** have been BLMN, DIS, RH and CVNA.\n\n[Proof. Linda, please come home. I'll do better](https://i.imgur.com/8tKgCGC.png)\n\n    PCG 1/15/21 13C -20K\n    PCG 1/15/21 15C -19K\n    PCG 1/15/21 10C -3K\n    (Also hold USFD, MRO, XOM, HAL, MGM, BUD)\n\n[Proof of current holdings](https://i.imgur.com/FflSkHQ.png)\n\n\n***So - here comes my plea***. And I legit will donate $1 from every $100 earned from suggestions on this post to https://www.autismspeaks.org/. If we can get Linda back, not only will I be a happy man I'll be donating $1000 to further the study of WSB members.\n\nWhat are your 30 day YOLOs to help be bounce from $200k to $300k? I'm only interested in options, selling puts, and other cool shit. GTFO with your stocks. Prefer large caps to penny stocks. Convince me to \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c  hold on to my PCG plays.\n\nPlease post your plays below. I'll do my own DD and will tag you if/when I enter or exit a trade. Donations to https://www.autismspeaks.org/ at the end of July.\n\nTL:DR I should have inversed myself and instead I zagged when I should have zigged. Things were looking good but god damn I belong here and instead of holding on to my winnings I doubled down and quadrupled down on PCG as it was falling.", "created_utc": 1593702852.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hjytla/need_help_yolo_back_to_my_all_time_high_a_month/", "is_self": true}
