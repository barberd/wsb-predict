On the contrary, this is fucking amazing. \n\nSeriously, its amazing how autistic you guys all are and its contagious.\n\nI just wintessed someone go into a loss of $50,000 using a glitch which gave him infinite leverage. And then shortly after, the damn owners of the app used made a post almost threatening to ban you if you use this, AND IT GETS FUCKING BETTER, the mods motherfucking ban the cunts from the sub entirely. \n\nThen shortly after that again some dude finds a glitch to litterally gain infinite money from the same motherfuckers.\n\n/wsb you truly are one autistic amazing bunch and i can only every dream of being and autist of the same magnitude you guys are. Thanks, thats my two minutes.", "created_utc": 1575331757, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e586vi/one_month_of_wsb/", "is_self": true}
