Idk something about the ten's of millions of dollars that option writers will have to pay out if it squeezes just seems off to me. As fun as it seems to dream about the unconfirmed drink announcement and the stock skyrocketing to $5 or $6, there's a lot of money on the other side of that trade.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm thinking about doing a calendar spread short the $3c 1/17/20 for $0.06 credit and long $2.5 1/24/20 for $0.16 debit. Max loss = $10, max gain on 1/17/20 = $50, if the stock squeezes magically the week after max gain on 1/24/20 = theoretically unlimited but most likely will be at the most a couple hundred.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThoughts? Feels like I should just YOLO it because if they do actually announce it the stock will go nuts.", "created_utc": 1577377700, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/efxf1d/beware_acbs_max_pain_3c_1172020/", "is_self": true}
