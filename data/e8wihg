These can be derived from your own personal clairvoyance or from first-hand research conducted in the astral plane.\n\n**NO TECHNICAL ANALYSIS ALLOWED IN THIS THREAD**. TA is nothing but hocus pocus bullshit and everyone knows it. Also I'm flairing this post as DD so let's keep this discussion serious and keep the memes to a minimum.\n\nHere's my play of the day (currently awaiting approval of Level 5 options trading). It's a delta neutral quarter-covered call on Tesla. This consists of a long-expiration far out of the money short call (Jan '22 @ $600) and long 25 shares of underlying stock. The P&amp;L chart closely resembles a Cybertruck, which I believe is a positive omen that bodes well for this being a great play. https://i.imgur.com/mlU5z42.png\n\nIf TSLA hits $420ish by April '20, then I will add another 25 shares to the position. As Tesla continues to rise I will continue to add shares until the position is completely covered.\n\nMy max profit price target is $600. This will result in $6.25k profit from the original 25 shares, $2.6k in profit from the sold call, an estimated $4.5k profit from the $420 rebalancing, and an additional estimated $5k profit from further added shares, resulting in a total profit of $18k+. \n\nBased on my research, I believe this is a surefire tits-down play all the way.", "created_utc": 1576011122, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e8wihg/stock_option_bets_based_on_signs_omens_hunches/", "is_self": true}
