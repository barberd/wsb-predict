I just had my broker(interactive brokers) once again liquidate an ITM call position I wanted to keep almost an hour before the market close, leading to $30k of lost potential profits.\n\nYears ago when I was with E-Trade their risk management team would always call me and let me put a hold on liquidating ITM options on the day of expiration. They would trust me to do this by myself even though one time I didn't and the options auto-exercised and gave my account an enormous leveraged position. If they weren't such a shit broker I'd still be with them.\n\nWhat other brokers are similarly retarded like E-Trade? Don't say RH because they actually liquidate fairly early on opex days.", "created_utc": 1579296569, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eq6tnn/which_broker_has_the_most_retarded_risk/", "is_self": true}
