{"id": "b6rlzs", "title": "ATVI, WTW and K DD", "selftext": "ATVI is one of the few video game stocks that hasn't bounced back from its lows. 46% down from its 52 week high, 14.5% up from its 52 week low, with the recent announcement of COD for mobile this seems like a classic buy the dip opportunity. To top it off technicals are great, bullish divergences on Rate of Change and RSI and OBV has made a higher high. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKellog is one of the few food conglomerates still trading near its 52 week low. CAG had a great run (highlight of my last DD post, sold to soon, fuck me), GIS, MDLZ, CPB, all have rebounded from lows. K is 24% down from its 52 week high, 7.2% up from its 52 week low. What interests me most is the technicals, bullish divergences across daily and weekly charts for OBV, ROC, and RSI. In my experience OBV bullish divergences are a great sign for a bounce.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso holding a WTW leap. Oprah is down $48 million, she has hundreds of millions of viewers, pretty sure she wants her $$$ back. WTW is still the #1 weight loss program worldwide and their acquisition of Nutrisystem only adds to their marketshare. Most of my faith in WTW comes from Oprah being an OG.
