{"id": "cvosxv", "title": "BNS due dilligence", "selftext": "Im looking at BNS. Canadian bank. Canada got slammed in the jobs numbers a few weeks ago. BNS has missed last couple earnings. It just entered bear market territory. Been on the decline be for weeks. Earnings are tommorow morning. There are a few 2 week strikes where breakeven is 0.4% below current price. I\u2019m not making this trade but I\u2019m offering it to you. Also BNS is one of the banks big short guy is shorting. Barely up this morning but these could be printing before we even get to earnings.\n\n090619 70.5P on the tsx.", "created_utc": 1566829654, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cvosxv/bns_due_dilligence/", "is_self": true}
