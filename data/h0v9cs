When the market goes down, TVIX goes up.  \n\n\n\n\n\nSo it looks like it's gonna be hard red today.  And all my shits trapped in calls and stocks that i need to go up.  But last time the market crashed, TVIX went to 1k.  granted it was 3x leveraged last time, and now they've downgraded to 2x.  but any big movement downwards you can ease the pain of your losses if you get some tvix early.  just remember you don't want to hold tvix for days and days and days.  it's like options.  there's a decay.  \n\n\n\n\n\nor if anyone else has any good plays for big red days....\n\n\n\n\n\n\nor if the jobs report is bad, we'll go green and you don't need to make this move....", "created_utc": 1591864365.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h0v9cs/this_is_the_play_for_red_markets/", "is_self": true}
