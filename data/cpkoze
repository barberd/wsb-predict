Before the afternoon, I had downloaded RobinHood, transferred bread, and bought options. I literally don't even know what the fuck an option is or what that means but its awesome and I love it.\n\nYou see bros, I am a turbo autistic mega retard. Absolute degenerate gambler to the Cerebral Palsy level but it's cool because I love it, right up there with hookers and blow. With that said, I feel right at home here with the rest of you fucktards, so here's a thank you to all of you and to this sub.\n\nAnyway, I placed a Call option on RVLV yesterday (I barely know wtf that even means but I think it'll go up), but I'm unable to monitor that shit consistently throughout the day. If the stock moves up to a price that I like, I want to exercise the option before the expiration date (Friday Aug, 16th). Am I able to do that on RobinHood? Basically, I want to place a limit order to sell my call options when/if they appreciate. If possible, can someone please direct me on how to do this or link me to a clear explanation? I wasn't able to find a clear explanation when I searched it and I wanna at least try and avoid making a idiopathic mistake.\n\nThank you for your time fellas, and good luck out there.", "created_utc": 1565653452, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cpkoze/new_mega_degenerate_can_i_set_a_limit_sell_order/", "is_self": true}
