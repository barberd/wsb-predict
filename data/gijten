Today actually went pretty well all things considered - I hope others had a similarly good day. Unfortunately no NVAX gains for me - but I'll take what I can get.\n\nBeing up $300 and actually being able to know those gains aren't going to disappear overnight is a pretty good feeling. I actually ran out of cash today at around 12:30 because I had put it all into the below plays and missed out on a couple things later in the day - but overall feel pretty good - especially about cutting my losses on CRM before she dived further. \n\nI did make two fuckups today - one for the better and one for the worse.\n\n1. I was trying to set up a trailing stop on TWLO, and instead accidentally made a super low limit order. Could've been up another $200 today if I didn't fuck that up - but gains are gains\n2. Was actually trying to buy more EGHT instead of VTIQ - I was going back and forth on each and did not pay attention to what was in the order tab. While it turned out well today, I need to watch that in the future.\n\nOne of the things that was recommended to me was taking profits on a more regular basis - I definitely don't disagree with the idea - I was thinking maybe taking $1k once I hit $6k - and then I would have $5k to use on a daily basis - does anyone have any thoughts on that?\n\n**The Plan:**\n\n1. Get a cash account and fund with $2000\n2. Play intra-day swing and momentum trades\n3. Cut losses early and often - wins will accumulate over losses. \n4. Take profits Regularly\n   1. Account Balance $4000 - take $2000 to cover initial investment\n   2. Account Balance $14328 - take $12328 to cover cash losses\n   3. Account balance of $6057.37 - take $4057.37 to cover equity losses  \n\n\n**Position History:** \n\nDay 2: 5/12 +29.53% - $1046.34 - $1356.57\n\n|Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|CRM 6/19 200C|\\+2|1|$263|$265|\n|EGHT 6/19 20C|\\+59|1|$191|$250|\n|TWLO 5/29 205C|\\+30|1|$370|$400|\n|VTIQ 5/15 30C|\\+224|2|$103|$215|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDay 1: 5/11 +5% - $1000.89 - $1046.34\n\n|Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|DDOG 5/15 55c|\\+54|1|$380|$434|\n|CSCO 5/15 44.5c|\\-16|2|$214|$198|\n|CHWY 5/15 39.5c|\\+12|1|$134|$146|", "created_utc": 1589315753.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gijten/day_2_512_from_down_to_up_the_road_to_1838537/", "is_self": true}
