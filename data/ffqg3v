If your individual stocks fall too quickly (beyond maximum daily allowable percentage decline) they will be subject to Limit Down rules similar to what you are seeing in the Dow, S&P and Nasdaq futures today, which have been halted temporarily.\n\nIn stocks the halts are for a maximum of 10 minutes at a time. If we have a full blown panic liquidation event, spreads will increase and liquidity will be poor. Tread with caution. DON'T GET LUL'D!!!!\n\nThe following pdf from Oppenheimer has a table that shows the maximum allowable price bands for Tier 1 (5% )and Tier 2 (10%) stocks with examples.\n\n [https://www.oppenheimer.com/\\_assets/docs/legal/limit-up-limit-down.pdf](https://www.oppenheimer.com/_assets/docs/legal/limit-up-limit-down.pdf) \n\nWhat is Limit Up-Limit Down (LULD)?\n\nOn April 5, 2011, national securities exchanges and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA) filed a proposal to establish a new \u201climit up-limit down\u201d rule to address extraordinary market volatility in U.S. equity markets. The Limit Up-Limit Down (LULD) mechanism is intended to prevent trades in National Market System (NMS) securities from occurring outside of specified price bands. The bands would be set at a percentage level above and below the average reference price of the security over the immediately preceding five-minute period. To accommodate more fundamental price moves, there would be a five-minute trading pause \u2013 similar to the pause triggered by the current single-stock circuit breakers \u2013 only if trading is unable to occur within the specified price band after 15 seconds. On May 31, 2012, the SEC approved the NMS Plan on a pilot basis.\n\n[https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/content/MarketRegulation/LULD\\_FAQ.pdf?mod=article\\_inline&mod=article\\_inline](https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/content/MarketRegulation/LULD_FAQ.pdf?mod=article_inline&mod=article_inline)", "created_utc": 1583735068.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffqg3v/for_the_luldz_information_about_limit_up_limit/", "is_self": true}
