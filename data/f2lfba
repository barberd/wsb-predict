We have some of the largest companies as customers, which can end up spending millions and millions just for our contract. Yes, millions on an audio video contractor. Anyway, every week my company publishes last weeks jobs that were sold. Well as I was looking up earning reports this week I noticed a company I recognized a few hours earlier in my company news letter. This company is Marathon Oil and they just signed a 6.6 million dollar contract with my company. So maybe last quarter was a good one? Who knows but I thought I would give you autistic people something to think about and maybe yolo all your money way on.", "created_utc": 1581481346, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f2lfba/mro_dd_for_upcoming_earnings/", "is_self": true}
