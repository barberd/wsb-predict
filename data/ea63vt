I thought to myself hey, this can only get better tomorrow. So I, a senior finance major with less than 2k to his name, hold my gains through the night.\n\nI wake up early. I\u2019m ready for more money. I make a coffee and wait for the Chinese to boot lick Trump. Market opens.\n\n\n[My call values were halved by the time a could get a sell order to go through.](https://imgur.com/adn6M3W) Guh. Oh well still made some money. This is were I\u2019m going to really shine. I [immediately buy](https://imgur.com/uSmnyqG)43.5 12/20 calls and wait.\n\n\n[I\u2019m a fucking genius](https://imgur.com/d0aate5). I just made 70 dollars. Do I care I just lost 400 bucks? Fuck no, I\u2019m a savant. Poor people disgust me. \n\nIt\u2019s time to play [both sides](https://imgur.com/nH7Nz6K). I\u2019m fucking brilliant, people are scared about the up coming news and I will profit selling just before the announcement. \n\n[Seconds later I lost 110 dollars.](https://imgur.com/PEsZoGa) I sold instantly because I don\u2019t fucking lose money. How could I ever think AMD put options could ever make money? Oh well everyone makes mistakes, even really smart and successful people, like me.\n\nBack on the call [train.](https://imgur.com/2oEJupb)\nI believe in this company and orange man. Market makers are on my side here. Minutes later [I lose 180 dollars.](https://imgur.com/5LyQmfD)\n\nThese fucking rich, bourgeois fucks at Wall Street scammed me. The 1% are all crooks! The working class carries these fraudulent bastards to there ivory towers. That\u2019s it. I am not done with you scam artists. \n\nI have a moment of clarity. Sweeping orchestral music starts to sound around me. Numbers are flying off of my Robinhood app and surround me. \n\nI am the market. I am.\n\n\nIt hits me. Who has the most to win from a tumultuous day of trade war announcements? \n\nSoy beans. SOY FUCKING BEANS!\nAnd holy fucking shit would you look at that the very first stock that appears when you google \u201csoybean stocks\u201d is none other than the esteemed archer Daniels Midland Company.\n\n\nA.... D.... M.\n\nADM.... AMD. Jesus Christ, I\u2019ve done it. Let\u2019s go all in.\n\nWith no research and no financial analysis on a low volume security I place the call order..... everything is perfect. It all\nMakes sense. Let\u2019s let it ride.\n\n\n\n[Minutes later the stock tumbles.](https://imgur.com/RxVbkjZ) \n\n\nI am now below my initial deposit. Fuck me. Fuck you.", "created_utc": 1576254251, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ea63vt/i_am_a_fucking_retarded_person_so_please_dont/", "is_self": true}
