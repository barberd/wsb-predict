{"id": "ckq3b9", "title": "SQ Earnings Thread", "selftext": "Alright fellas, Square has been on a great run this past month, up 12%~. However, SQ usually takes a shit post-earnings release. Personally, I\u2019m not playing options on this one. I just want to break down some facts and get some opinions. First off, Jack hasn\u2019t been causing any trouble lately which is a good thing. SQ hasn\u2019t received any upgrades recently that could drive the price up. I don\u2019t think an earnings beat could drive the price up alone. Call options are 2:1 to puts and a 7%~ move is expected in either direction. I know we are having a good day today, but with the market being so tentative lately I don\u2019t see SQ jumping up in price. PayPal and just Tech in general also just aren\u2019t having the best of luck lately. The previously mentioned 12% month gain leaves SQ vulnerable to profit taking. So what\u2019s everyone think? Is Square going to be break it\u2019s history of dumping at earnings and fly? Or just go limp?", "created_utc": 1564674432, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ckq3b9/sq_earnings_thread/", "is_self": true}
