{"id": "fh58l3", "title": "[Discussion/DD] $SNAP massively oversold?", "selftext": "Yeah, yeah I know\n\n\"Snap sucks you retard why are you even bullish on it\"\n\n\"who even uses that shit anymore, it's all Instagram nowadays\"\n\n\"they aren't and will never be profitable you fucking autist\"\n\nI get the criticisms, I really do. And for the most part they do have some merit. Insta/FB is without a doubt the regning king of social media and Fuckerberg has the entire world licking on his giant social media nutsack as he ejaculates everyone's personal data into the mouths of advertisers everywhere. \n\nNow, let's pretend we have more than 3 brain cells for a minute here and try to think critically about what SNAP has to offer, both upside-wise and downside-wise\n\n\n**Q4 2019 earnings**\n\nA little over a month ago, SNAP announced their ER. The market was anticipating an earnings and revenue beat on that ER, finally declaring snap to be profitable after all this time. People were buying into it like crazy as we approached the ER and analysts kept raising their price targets over and over and over. \n\nEnter ER day. SNAP announces they actually managed to post positive record profits in EPS (more than tripling what the analysts were estimating). Amazing, this is what the market was waiting for! SNAP to the moon, right? FUCKIN NOPE. They also announced that they missed on revenue estimates by a roaring 0.2%. \n\n*0.2%*\n\n**0.2%**\n\nDoesn't sound so bad right? \n\nWell the market had other ideas and the stock dropped down almost 20% over the course of the following day. \n\nSurely this is an overreaction and its bound to recover right? Again, fucking NOPE. It's literally been in freefall all the way through to today as the market was force-fed spoonfuls of bad news in quick succession. It is still yet to recover any sort of steam as I write this on 3/11/2020 (SNAP closed today at 10.80, down 9.84% on the day and down 44% from its 52 week high of 19.25 on 01/23/2020 right before the ER)\n\nFirst of all, let's address the 2 elephants in the room currently sticking their dicks in the market and what their impact would be on SNAP specifically:\n\n1. Oil price war\n\nAlthough Saudi crashing oil prices glonally has a fairly huge negative effect on the market as a whole, if we analyze individual impact, this literally shouldn't affect SNAP in any way, shape or form. The entire world's supply of oil could run out today and SNAP as a company would remain totally unaffected. \n\n2. Coronavirus\n\nNow this is where things get interesting for SNAP. The assumption people are making is that everything will be affected negatively by this virus, SNAP included. And for the vast majority of stocks, they would likely be right. Coronavirus is causing a huge supply shock, manufacturing delays, prohibiting people from going to work/school and all in all just causing a huge global economic slowdown. Not to mention its taking out the boomers who currently own the biggest % of the market and may easily decide to liquidate if they feel their life/money is threatened.\n\n*However*, let's take a closer look at how this affects SNAP on its own, shall we? \n\n\n\nIs SNAP negatively impacted by the manufacturing slowdown or the supply shock that's hitting everything right now?\n\nNope, they don't manufacture shit and couldn't care less about supplies or imports/exports from any country\n\n\n\nIs SNAP negatively impacted by the fact that people can't go to work/school for a few weeks and have to chill at home?\n\nNope, as a matter of fact, similarly to Netflix, they actually make more money when people don't have shit to do and are sitting at home scrolling through their phones or texting friends. You wanna know what else? 90% of kids in middle school/high school in the US currently use SNAP and most of them consider it their primary method of getting in contact with friends. Now, guess who's schools are about to get canceled and won't be allowed to go see their friends face to face for a while? Yep, you guessed it. SNAP's whole fucking userbase almost. Very soon a shitton of kids will have to stay at home instead of going to school or going out with friends, and they will resort to their main method of talking to their friends while that happens: SNAP.\n\nOkay, so it's basically gonna be like Netflix where people use it a lot more just cause they're stuck at home right? So they should behave similarly through this whole thing?\n\nNo motherfucker, that's the best fucking part. We're diving headfirst into a recession right now. What do people do in a recession? They save money by cutting out services they pay for but don't necessarily need (i.e. Netflix). Well, guess what service finally figured out how to make money without the users paying anything? That's right, asshole. Mother fucking SNAPCHAT. That's makes it an even more reliable hold than NFLX right now despite what the market is pricing in\n\nThe sentiment around SNAP right now is oddly similar to how Tesla was being treated a little over a year ago when people were overselling it, shitting on it, and claiming it'll never post profit and will go bankrupt. That changes this year just like Tesla changed last year. Don't miss out on this opportunity to buy in while the getting is good or you may end up begrudgingly buying it at $25/share like some of you assholes who bought Tesla at 700. \n\nIf you want additional DD and a more detailed look at their numbers lately, check this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fbzix6/bought_snap_stock_friday_1379\n\n/u/donnieisWiafu2 goes into what makes this such a solid buy in very good detail \n\nPS: for the most part this all applies applies to FB as well, but if we're talking about value investing, the value/price ratio I'm seeing in SNAP is much higher than that of FB atm. FB is currently almost 30x as big as SNAP marketcap-wise\n\n\nTL;DR:- Long SNAP - Middle/high school/college kids all about to have their schools canceled and won't be able to interact with each other for a while except through social media mainly. Vast majority of these kids are addicted to SNAP and will cause it to post record profits and revenue next Q without a doubt (they already practically did last Q). This will cause SNAP to soar. Get in while it's being pummeled right now by an irrational market.\n\n\nEDIT: OK noted, you cocksuckers only understand strike price and expirey. Buy LEAP calls for Jan 2021/2022 if you hate buying stocks or maybe like 12-14c that expire a couple months from now so it includes their next earnings report. I would highly recommend picking up a bunch of shares and holding for a couple years tho. You'll thank yourself and me later.", "created_utc": 1583963962.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fh58l3/discussiondd_snap_massively_oversold/", "is_self": true}
