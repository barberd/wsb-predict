{"id": "ger6bp", "title": "Biotech options play - Heron Therapeutics (HRTX)", "selftext": "I made this trade on April 23 and forgot to post about it, but it hasn't moved much so still plenty of time to get in. Heron Therapeutics (HRTX) is developing a drug for post-operative pain called HTX-011. HTX-011 is a patch form of 2 drugs that already have been use for a long time in bupivacaine and meloxicam. There is a strong demand for a non-opiod pain killer so the the market for this drug is huge, $1B+. Heron's prior application for approval was turned down by the FDA (in what is known as a Complete Response Letter aka CRL) in early 2019 because the FDA had concerns over the manufacturing facility for HTX-011, NOT over the safety or efficacy of the drug itself. In the interim Heron fixed whatever problem there was at the manufacturing facility and the FDA inspector gave his approval. This is from Heron's earnings report from today (May 6):\n\n**Contract Manufacturing Site for HTX-011:** In February 2020, Heron announced that the contract manufacturing site used to manufacture HTX-011 has been *reinspected by the FDA* with no Form 483 observations issued and *with a recommendation by the FDA inspector for approval of the site.* Heron has not been informed of any other manufacturing concerns.\n\nSo, Heron resubmitted its application (NDA - New Drug Approval) to the FDA and it has a PDUFA date of June 26, 2020. This is the LATEST the FDA must give its approval or denial of the drug, but it could come even earlier. From today's earnings report:\n\n**New Drug Application for HTX-011:** In September 2019, Heron resubmitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for HTX-011, an investigational agent for the management of postoperative pain. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date is June 26, 2020.\n\nThis seems like as sure a thing in biotech for approval. Of course, nothing is 100%. But this is the closest to a slam dunk I've ever seen. Heron was trading at a high of $25 in December 2019 before all the Corona concerns. At a MINIMUM I'm expecting it to get back to trading to this price once HTX-011 is approved. For a realistic maximum I'm thinking it could get back to its July 2018 high of $37. Heron is only $15.30 today. This is how I played it on April 23:\n\n**Buy (17) Sep 18 20 13.0c at 5.10. when HRTX was trading at $14.48**\n\n**Buy 100 shares of HRTX as a long term investment**\n\nI like to buy ITM options to have at least some intrinsic value. My break even is $18.10\n\nThe same option as of today (May 6) is 5.90 and the underlying share price is $15.30. Plenty of time for the stock to run once the anticipated approval comes through on June 26. I'm an MD and focus most of my time on biotech investing and I'm pretty confident in this play, but I want to emphasize again there are no sure things in biotech. The main concern is because of corona the FDA delays the PDUFA date, but I don't expect that because the only holdup was over the manufacturing facility and the FDA already reviewed the efficacy and safety of the drug in the past and had no concerns. Remeber this is only a reformulation into a patch of 2 drugs that have been in use a long time already.", "created_utc": 1588794793.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ger6bp/biotech_options_play_heron_therapeutics_hrtx/", "is_self": true}
