Being a follower of NBEV for a while (to play the pot hype) I assumed the deal was for their CBD Marley drinks. I'm sure I wasn't alone in this. \n\n  \nHowever I did some more research and it's not for their CBD drinks. It's just their healthy-alternative drink options. I can't see any justifiable way for a stock to boost 40% for healthier drinks. I think the news was delivered sketchily, and most people believe it was their CBD drinks and bought in to the hype. As anyone who has followed NBEV would know, this stock runs and dies on hype around their CBD Marley drinks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI believe the stock could still run more due to people FOMOing in and shorts covering. But this stock was already in a steady decline from the huge bubble that formed on it back in Sept '18, and everyone knows its overvalued (but we all wanted to play on the pot hype). Well this news isn't about the pot hype. It's about \"healthy drinks\". This is America, we don't care about health, goddamn it! This stock is going to crash back to $5 or below without any news on their CDB drinks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThoughts?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - NBEV is running on fake hype and I believe a nice put/short play = free tendies", "created_utc": 1554755927, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/baytwm/nbev_the_big_short_pt2/", "is_self": true}
