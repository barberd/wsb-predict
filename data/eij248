So how can you avoid throwing away your kiddies college fund to fulfil your gambling your habit? Well I'm going to try and teach y'all, autist to autist, how to make tendies like u/haput91 makes me-me's and avoid being the next u/analfarmer2. The stonks market awaits!\n\nNote:&gt;! If you think I'm wrong, fuck you. We're all autists and someone has to explain to these degenerates what a stonk is. Go watch Rick and Morty if your IQ isn't too low.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIdea 1: What the hell is this guy talking about?\n\nCalls/Buys:&gt;! A bet that the stonk will go up to a certain point !&lt;\n\nPuts/Sells&gt;!: A bet that the stonk will go down. !&lt;\n\nBulls: &gt;!Einsteins who believe stonks only go up! !&lt;\n\nBears: &gt;!Newtons who believe stonks will always go down! !&lt;\n\nThetas: &gt;!Beethovens that believe stonks will stay at the same level! !&lt;\n\nStonks: &gt;!Parts of publicly traded companies that change in value that even a BECKY could buy. !&lt;\n\nBECKY's: &gt;!Like Karens but for stonks. !&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPoint 27: Gimmi those tendies!\n\nSo how are we gonna avoid spending little Jimmies college fund? \n\nFirst of all we're gonna stop using options. Instead of Calls&amp;Puts use Buys&amp;Sells. You still feel great when you win tendies but instead of loosing 100% on an expiring call you loose 3%, meaning you can make the same mistakes again and again without taking out a third mortgage!\n\nNext? \n\nThat's literally it. All you bulls going GUH as TSLA doesn't stay at $420 would be saving so much $$$ if you just used Buys instead of Calls. Now go inverse whatever I say I'm doing and find out what leverage is for yourself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll update this post with more shitty info if you autists ask for it.", "created_utc": 1577890162, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eij248/how_to_trade_like_a_professional_stonks_autist_in/", "is_self": true}
