It's website doesn't say anything.\n\nI don't think the stock is worth buying at over $15 right now because you have no operational service yet, you only have two space taxis built, only one spaceport online and no flown customers. You're one deadly mishap away from it going to zero, with a company that's already had a deadly mishap that delayed everything five years, you might as well gamble on a biotech stock. And if they do start flying passengers this year, there's only a small number of people willing to pay the higher $250,000 \"first flights\" price. That analyst's prediction of two million rich ppl willing to pay that much is stupid and wrong, IMHO. If they can complete thousands of successful flights from several spaceports and scale the price down to $100,000 a ticket, then maybe. They're selling a suborbital hop and a glider landing, not an hours-long orbital trip.\n\nI think Virgin Orbit is where the real value is. Cost of launch is like $12 million for a small payload up to 600-something pounds. A two stage rocket launched from a modified 747 flying at high altitude blasts into orbit. The alternative is booking a SpaceX Falcon 9 for $60 million+ per launch and then splitting that cost with other small satellite operators who will launch with you, which will delay you by however many years given everyone has to agree from what launch location and what orbit to insert.\n\nCan launch from pretty much any large airport on short notice, giving SPCE a huge leg up on the dozens of competitors racing to get small commercial satellite launch vehicle to market. They're all pouring tons of money into R&amp;D and test flights because they know with hundreds of customers out there it's worth billions of new business. My only question is how good/fast is SPCE getting at manufacturing new Virgin Orbit rockets, they're going to need several just to fulfill the NASA CubeSat contract they signed.", "created_utc": 1580701568, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ey0uch/is_the_virgin_orbit_first_orbital_test_flight/", "is_self": true}
