{"id": "gk6w80", "title": "My Drunk TA May 15", "selftext": "Here's my thoughts + drunk TA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst off I am bearish I am currently holding \n\n40 July 17 200 PUTS (yea fuck off i realized i should've closed these out a long time ago).\n\nCredit Spread July 17 300/310\n\n10 July 17 280 PUTS\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore i begin\n\n1.) Do I know what im doing?  Not really, have honestly debated writing a bot that inverses my trades so if you inverse me then i feel good that i at least gave back to the community.\n\n2.) Do I think we'll re-test March lows? Not by July, Currently just trying to short the bounces to make up for my potential 40K loss on the July 17 200.\n\nSome TA:\n\n.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Some drunk TA](https://preview.redd.it/gowd740vjwy41.png?width=2618&format=png&auto=webp&s=4aa79fa478b42467ee1bd49a87ac4bf51df23768)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThings i'm watching:\n\n1.) On May 1st we broke the rising wedge. the 300 level is where there are a ton of lines (might be hard to see). I was prepared to go all in on calls if we had closed above that and just eat the loss on my 40 July 17 Puts (I bought them  March 27 and thought I was gods gift to earth with trading).\n\n2.) We broke down and then traded in a range from May 1-May12. Given how this market has been acting. ATH was and still is a realistic possibility. But we did break under that trend line at May 12 (didn't draw the Head and shoulders but a lot of youtube traders were watching that level. I entered into my 280 Puts at that level.\n\n3.) At the moment its 3:09AM and futures kind of tested that H&S trend line which makes me think we'll have more downward pressure or its just gonna get pinned due to options expiry on May 15.\n\n4.)  Will probably exit my positions at 260 level which is the next fib retracement - will start selling credit spreads against my stupid 200 put position.\n\n5.) If we break above that H&S line then ill start getting into calls.\n\n6.) If shits not interesting next week might starting going theta gang to recoup losses\n\nGot tricked:\n\n\\- Went all in calls when the fed dropped rates to 0 but the market continued to limit down (said to myself that I wasn't gonna fall for it again after shorting the beginnings of the repo operation in Oct 2019). Was able to turn shit into a credit spread and make it back.\n\n\\- Fed introduced a multi trillion spending bill, I said well if the market went down on 0% interest rates then it'll still go down, so i put most. of my winnings from shorting the crash into those puts. \n\nThings i've learned:\n\n\\- Always play both sides and don't develop a thesis cuz you're probably wrong.\n\n\\- If you start talking about how good a trader you are, or even remotely get cocky its time to inverse yourself (this strat has helped me a lot)\n\n\\- Anything can happen, as much of a bear as I am at the current moment it is still a realistic possibility that we go to ATH.\n\n\\- Im thankful for this sub as its been one of the best resources to help me with information. ideas and laughs, through the good and the bad, and as much shit that people post we're all just trying to make a bunch of money to ball out and live a better life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR cuz i've been here long enough to know people don't read long ass posts\n\nIm drunk and this sub has helped me through the good and the bad so thank you.\n\nI hope that my drunk TA and analysis helps someone (lmk if i should clean it up if it is remotely helpful or lmk where i went wrong).\n\nAccept the fact that March lows are not gonna happen during the summer (end of July)  and try to use credit spreads if you can to reduce losses (im sure im not the only one who thought they were a badass shorting the .382 fib retracement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDO NOT BUY JNUG (seriously I was up 200% after the crash and thought I was gods gift to earth and was like JNUG will make me a ton of money). Bagholding that ill September and got fucked on the spread.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntldr tldr;\n\n I want to give back to this sub and hope my drunk TA helps (lmk if i should clean it up and i'll repost)\n\nNot worried about any puts until we close above 300 - at that point we're going to ATH so you should be able to recoup any losses on puts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCheck out that low - lots of institutional buying (taken from squeeze metrics) which likely caused a short covering rally + fed stimulus (they are scaling back right now if you check out their balance sheets).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/od37t9v8swy41.png?width=1412&format=png&auto=webp&s=78034800e840ec408e9e93abf6adc47c87508a4e\n\nIm selling my S&P shares on every bounce and rolling them into high dividend stocks (based on my luck you should inverse me, just do me the courtesy of telling me you made money so I know my thesis is right).\n\nIm ridiculously drunk and this took me a really long time to write", "created_utc": 1589539867.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gk6w80/my_drunk_ta_may_15/", "is_self": true}
