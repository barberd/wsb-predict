This is not a post PRO or CON on Corona or any specific stock.  This is Harvard Medical's Corona FAQ.  (THANK YOU HARVARD) Use accordingly to make your Bull and Bear plays.  In being respectful to Harvard please use the site directly.. I've taken a few summary points for the short read.\n\n[https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/as-coronavirus-spreads-many-questions-and-some-answers-2020022719004](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/as-coronavirus-spreads-many-questions-and-some-answers-2020022719004)\n\nthe virus can spread from one person to another, most likely through  droplets of saliva or mucus carried in the air for up to six feet or so  when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through viral particles  transferred when shaking hands or sharing a drink with someone who has  the virus.\n\nAn  incubation period is the time between catching an illness and showing  symptoms of the illness. Current estimates suggest that symptoms of  COVID-19 usually appear within around five days or less in most cases,  but the range could be between one and 14 days.\n\nFever,  dry cough, trouble breathing, and sometimes pneumonia are the common  symptoms of COVID-19. There have been some reports of gastrointestinal  symptoms (nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea) before respiratory symptoms  occur, but this is largely a respiratory virus.\n\nThose who have the  virus may have no obvious symptoms (be asymptomatic) or symptoms  ranging from mild to severe. In some cases, the virus is  life-threatening or fatal.\n\nNo vaccine is available, although scientists are working on vaccines. In 2003, scientists tried to develop a vaccine to prevent [SARS](https://www.cdc.gov/sars/about/fs-sars.html) but the epidemic ended before the vaccine could enter clinical trials.\n\nCurrently  there is no specific antiviral treatment for this new coronavirus.  Treatment is therefore supportive, which means giving fluids, medicine  to reduce fever, and, in severe cases, supplemental oxygen. People who  become critically ill from COVID-19 may need a respirator to help them  breathe. Bacterial infection can complicate this viral infection.  Patients may require antibiotics in cases of bacterial pneumonia as well  as COVID-19.\n\nA  specialized test must be done to confirm that a person has COVID-19.  Most testing in the US has been performed at the CDC. However, the goal  is to send test kits to state laboratories so testing can be performed  locally.\n\nAs of  February 25, 2020, the reported confirmed cases and deaths in China  suggest the mortality rate is roughly 3%. It is important to remember  that early on in an epidemic there is a \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d phenomenon  where we overestimate more severe cases and mild or asymptomatic cases  go unrecognized, so the mortality seems higher than the reality. That  may be happening when we speak of up to 3% mortality. By contrast, SARS  had a mortality rate of around 10%; the MERS mortality rate is closer to  30% to 40%. There appear to be many more COVID-19 cases confirmed than  there were with SARS and MERS.", "created_utc": 1582911458, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/faye5a/harvard_medical_everything_you_need_to_know_about/", "is_self": true}
