ALSO NEWS FLASHES IF YOU LIVE UNDER A FKIN ROCK.", "selftext": "This week hasn't been like the preceding weeks.  It's pretty fucking lame, actually.  I've attached a snapshot of the DOW's open/close for the past 10 days.  Out of courtesy, I added in the point change so you autists can save yourself hurting your little fingers on that shitty android calculator.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[10 Day historical DOW](https://preview.redd.it/bw7fbeuay3p41.png?width=1814&format=png&auto=webp&s=351302119209edfedc434a973a21180a2bcd58f2)\n\nAs you can see, the past three days have been FUCKING GREEN.  I FUCKING HATE GREEN BECAUSE I'M AN AUTIST HOLDING PUTS WHO SAID FUCK CALLS, CALLS ARE GAY NOW WHATEVER.  Now, I have major autist FOMO and I hate myself but whatever.\n\nMoving on, the STIMULUS PACKAGE was passed this week.  Good for us artists, an extra $1200 to blow on fucking SPY puts, furthering our nation's faltering economic sentiment and downtrend.  Lovely.  Gay bears want nothing else!\n\nHighly awaited unemployment numbers were released today, some 3.3m unemployed - many of which are creating onlyfans accounts to support their prescription drug habits.\n\nThe United States has surpassed China in the number of confirmed and officially reported coronavirus cases, because we fucking win at everything!! Also notice the operative clause in that sentence \"officially reported\" because CHINA IS FUCKING LYING.  Chinese Virus, China Virus, Kung Flu, whatever the fuck you want to call it, these fuckers are lying.  No, I'm not racist.  I don't call it those names, our autist president does.\n\nNext up, rumors circulating WSBGod has died again, this time of the beervirus, abandoning his loyal cult of degenerate artists.\n\nFurthermore, a screenshot of some bigger players option purchasing today and this week, courtesy of the overpriced and only somewhat useful FlowAlgo.\n\n[Today's $SPY Option Flow](https://preview.redd.it/ifnebdbb04p41.png?width=2128&format=png&auto=webp&s=99afea0dc64a5205ea6d65a59bd7a027796c4a90)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Weekly Option flow on most traded underlyings](https://preview.redd.it/bl2oq6rc04p41.png?width=2756&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b349f3fb0e00caff918c8a5d5ce7a0dcd662fa1)\n\nSecond to last, some great \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b predictions on SPY/SPX for the coming future.  Only adding my absolute favorites.  However, I am currently seeing ZERO long position chart/TA projections on SPY/SPX on TradingView premium.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Almost blew a load after looking at this.

Welp, the autists, by majority, were wrong again - me included.\n\n[Yesterday's Poll Results](https://preview.redd.it/jwgay5mxz3p41.png?width=1328&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e1b9f5f33758b1f550ce33d2e904d918d6ca965)\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/fpn9mu)", "created_utc": 1585269463.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpn9mu/dear_bears_bulls_green_or_red_tomorrow_327_are/", "is_self": true}
