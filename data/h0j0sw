Buy Stock ABC at Price X\n2. Sell at Y = X + 2% or\n3. If Y = X - 5%, Sell ABC, Bail on loop wait for human intervention\n4. Buy Stock ABC at Price X = Y - 2%\n5. Go to step 2\n\nJust wondering if there are any robo sites out there that already do something similar so I don't have to reinvent the wheel. Ideally it would check around every half hour or more.\n\nAssumptions: Trades are Free. Don't care about Taxes. Cash available to cover settlement waiting periods. Still investigating the number of trades allowed in a day at certain broker sites etc.", "created_utc": 1591819722.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h0j0sw/auto_trading_platform/", "is_self": true}
