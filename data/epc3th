That is because Apple\u2019s  product  is not the people, unlike the vast majority of the  corporate-tech empire  that dominates the financial markets, to their  great misfortune. They  thought people could be convinced to ***underestimate their own value.***\n\nTake  Silicon Valley, home of the richest, brightest minds of the American  experience. ALL OF THEM who have new families, take the time to ensure  that their kids get as little screen time as possible, and understand  the value of humanity, and human worth.\n\nThankfully,  political narratives are in play that may have paradigm shifts in the  way markets, (as well as economies, and the philosophic underpinning  they rely on) operate in the future\n\nApple\u2019s   value, is that it has the power to not only resist the regulatory   collapse of social media, but it has the largest financial cash reserves   to re-invest back into society (for who\u2019s good?), or whatever it wants   to emerge from the ashes of the financial reawakening.\n\nIt\u2019s   the same reason why the Omaha Guru, the Wizard of Finance is so  heavily  invested in Apple, and why he also (coincidentally, I\u2019m sure)  operated  under the same financial philosophy of prioritizing great free  cash flow  reserves.\n\nApple\u2019s  value can\u2019t be  measured purely by the market. It\u2019s measured by how  resilient they\u2019re  going to be in the upcoming regulation of social  media and the markets  they\u2019ve taken over.\n\nOutcomes  that  are out of all of their hands, and in the hands of the people.  People  who are becoming increasingly aware of the dangers of social  media, and  aware of the dangers of Corporatism in politics, and the  link between  both issues.\n\nThe link is there, and people are aware, and that\u2019s that makes Apple so valuable.\n\nSo  Apple is the company to invest in, if you see a future where social  media becomes more scrutinized and regulated (it already is).\n\nRegulation  is not enough however, and people know that the mere existence of an  instrument that can be so easily exploited for tyranny should be viewed  with extreme skepticism. Particularly if it seems to mobilize dissent  against that skepticism.\n\nIf and when the next recession hits, one thing's for sure: Apple has the has statistical odds of coming out on top.", "created_utc": 1579138535, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/epc3th/my_thesis_for_why_apple_is_the_most_valuable/", "is_self": true}
