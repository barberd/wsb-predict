Look at Tesla, bagholders are able to circle-jerk each other off for years despite *negative* EPS.\n\nIf BYND drops after earnings  it won't be be as initially hard as people think. If BYND does get higher than expected EPS the collective creaming of the circle-jerk might just act as lube.", "created_utc": 1564273540, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cip65m/bynd_buyers_are_dumb_but_deep_otm_put_buyers_are/", "is_self": true}
