You call option idiots probably could make money here too but a healthy dividend payer at this rate is a totally buy. Yes, they have suffered on the short term due to some bullshit. Stubs grows, insane movie lineup for years to come. Cash flow is plenty and some of their debt is going to be ignored by the street soon. They\u2019re not selling and the biggest theatre chain is not going anywhere. Buy if you like money. Hold if you like more money this thing is going to $20 near future and you\u2019ll enjoy your dividend for years to come. \n\nLook at their 10k: http://investor.amctheatres.com/Cache/396943088.PDF?O=PDF&amp;T=&amp;Y=&amp;D=&amp;FID=396943088&amp;iid=4171292\n\nIf that bores you, go to the casino you probably will do better. \n\nTLDR: AMC is healthy and at a very low low with only upside coming. Read 10k and decide for yourself. \n\nSorry if you hold currently and this goes to $2.25 lol", "created_utc": 1560487321, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c0fy1b/buy_amc_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
