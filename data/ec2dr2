I\u2019d like to thank no one for the investment advice since my mind is my own broker. I\u2019ll be leaving this community and joining the cucks over in /r/PersonalFinance. They\u2019re telling me that my 4K will have me retired by 2169 if I put it all into SPY which sounds pretty good to me.\n\nA final thanks to PTON for saving my ass, goodbye everyone.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/o0uc1YI", "created_utc": 1576618401, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ec2dr2/buying_4k_in_spy_calls_that_never_expire/", "is_self": true}
