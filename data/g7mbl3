As much I hate to say it any person short selling this stock is an idiot. I have done crazy research on the company To the point that all I do is talk to my self about tesla. I am upset because As much as I hate the valuation of the stock when you dig deep into it Tesla this stock is fucking cheap. Tesla could report ugly number this upcoming quarter. but they got so much going on that the stock automatic will go up. ROADSTER, TESLA TRUCK, SOLAR, ROBO TAXI, SOFTWARE ETC...\nThe only negative I have seen about tesla so far is google trend is down and they have a lot of cars in stock for sale. Here is my thesis to keep it short and simple.\n\nTOYOTA+ORACLE+AMD+CUMMINS+= TESLA \n\nCall me crazy but is the truth \nTesla sell cars \nTesla build software\nTesla build chips\nTesla build trucks\n+ \nTesla robo taxi\nTesla ExonMobil  aka superchargers\nElon Musk love for tesla is like Donald trump love for stock market. \n\nI HATE TO SEE PEOPLE LOSE THERE HARD EARN MONEY. PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM TESLA SHORT SELLER.", "created_utc": 1587783883.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7mbl3/tesla_into_earnings_the_only_trend_i_see_is_up/", "is_self": true}
