I watched the movie Wolf of Wall St and after researched investing and stockbrokers and became quickly interested and downloaded the app called stash? I invested like 15 dollars and the value of my portfolio went down by like 14 cents in a couple days!?!?! I was disappointed and did some research on investing in penny stocks and that lead me to WallStBets\u2026 I investigated options trading and downloaded Robinhood. My grandma died and left her grandchildren 5k each I was going to use it for a car but I went ahead and used 2.5k for my robin hood for options I immediately turned that 2.5k into 4k over night with Appl Calls. I honestly thought I was a genius and I could become rich and bring my whole family riches and I would be the man of the family\u2026 So I told my boss I am pursuing entrepreneurship and I already made more in one day then I made in 2 weeks. I pretty much lost the rest on TSLA calls when it went up a ton and then dropped the next day because I sold. I now have 1.2k I plan to bring this back to my 2.5k and quit but I already quit my job.  \n\nAnyways the biggest problem with all of this is I woke up my parents early one morning and started talking to them like I am a genius and told them all about my investing skills and how I made over 3k in one day even though I only made 1.5k..I explained to them I was taught by Jordan Belfort\u2026They don\u2019t know I just watched the fucking movie. I\u2019m just really embarrassed because my dad was low key proud of me for a few days I even took him and my mom to a nice dinner at Olive Garden. UGH I\u2019m going to pull out and basically explain I think its to risky and I\u2019m going to take my investing strategies elsewhere. \n\nF.", "created_utc": 1581518901, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f2s9q3/so_i_quit_my_job_to_day_trade_i_dont_know_what_to/", "is_self": true}
