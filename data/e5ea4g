Options kind of scare me because I watched the \u201cwsb yolo\u201d video on YouTube where some guy got 50 grand in the hole. I don\u2019t want to be that guy.\n\n\nAnyways there\u2019s a call option that costs $1.78. The strike price is $167.50 (what\u2019s the difference between a strike price and the break even price?). It says I\u2019ll break even at 169.28. I just want to be absolutely sure the most I could possibly loose is $178 correct? I won\u2019t automatically buy 100 shares of CRM and get billed 16 grand that I don\u2019t have right? If the price goes to say $175 before the option expires I\u2019ll make ~500 dollars right?\n\nI\u2019m new to this. I prolly sound like an idiot, but I just want to be sure of what I\u2019m doing before I do it.", "created_utc": 1575362515, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e5ea4g/questions_about_a_crm_options_trade/", "is_self": true}
