{"id": "beuj6e", "title": "The SEC is losing and the media is silent...", "selftext": "Today, Elon Musk's attorney(s) and the SEC filed for an extension to continue their negotiations regarding the contempt hearing.\n\nFor those who have been brainwashed by the media leading up this contempt hearing, this is inconceivable. To those who understand that the SEC never got the control they wanted over Elon Musk in their original settlement, and totally fucked up trying to hold Elon Musk in contempt, this is expected.\n\nFirst, some facts...\n\nThe SEC wanted blood, filed for contempt, and got nothing. They are no further along than if they had called up Elon Musk's attorney(s) and asked to work out a new deal.\n\nElon Musk did not want to be held in contempt and so far, has not been held in contempt.\n\nThe SEC is NOT working with Elon Musk's attorney(s) because they want to...they were COURT ORDERED to work with his attorney(s).\n\nNow, back to the new information we got today...\n\nThe SEC was ORDERED to talk to Elon Musk's attorney(s) for 1 hour to come up with a solution. After this discussion within the 2 week time frame, they haven't come to an agreement yet.\n\nThe SEC, if they had the power in this negotiation, could have said, \"We negotiated as ordered, they refused our offers and didn't come to a new agreement, hold him in contempt now pls-k-thnx-bye\".\n\nTHEY DID NOT. Why you might ask?\n\nThe attorney(s) for Elon Musk holds ALL the cards in this negotiation and is in-charge of this entire situation. They have the high ground. If the SEC goes back to the Judge without an agreement, asking for contempt again, they will lose. If they appear to be unreasonable in ANY WAY, they will lose. If they didn't fear this outcome, they wouldn't be negotiating with Elon Musk's attorney(s) beyond the 1 hour.\n\nSo, do you want to know why the media is silent? It's because they don't want to bring attention to the fact that the SEC has totally fucked themselves...\n\nThank god (and the founders of this country) for the fucking amazing justice system in this country.\n\nDISCLOSURE: Long 500+ Shares of HELL.", "created_utc": 1555643921, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/beuj6e/the_sec_is_losing_and_the_media_is_silent/", "is_self": true}
