{"id": "g92412", "title": "DIS DD (repost) - Aronf32", "selftext": "I have received a lot of hate for this, so if you're going to hate, just leave.  If people had believed me, their portfolios would be up 40% in the hour that the market has been open.  This is not to exchange opinions, only to inform people of the financial state of Disney.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**DIS 5/15 $105 Call**\n\nHere's why I'm recommending this, if you wanna hear my backing. Walt Disney is one of the biggest companies in the world. To put this into perspective, they own ABC, Fox, FX, Disney, ESPN, Marvel, Pixar, Hulu, and a ton more. **The main things of this DD are Disney+, their upcoming EPS, and how they're undervalued during this coronavirus.** First of all, Disney+. Disney+ has been booming in numbers, before the coronavirus, and with the virus added on, it is literally exploding. Along with its other subsidiaries, Disney is one of the only companies in a better position because of this virus. Yet they lost 31% due to the virus. They should have benefitted. The beautiful thing is (my second point), their EPS is coming up on May 6th. 3 out of the 4 of Disney's EPS's over the past year have had a positive suprise, and this one will obviously have a huge one as well. Zacks estimates that they will have an EPS suprise of 14.7%, I believe it will be a lot more. And finally, combining all of this, they should really be up 30% instead of down, and this upcoming EPS will prove that, and I believe the week after their EPS will be as green as the Rockefeller Christmas tree. I'm getting excited just writing about this. This is no joke, seriously, don't know how I can be more serious, the best opportunity I have seen in my life. Trust me, and buy a new car later.\n\nMy reasoning for 5/15, is I want to not only capitalize off of the immediate response to the EPS release, but also the week after, as I believe the market will take time to realize that it made a mistake about Disney.\n\n**I picked $105 just to be super safe, but a $110 or $115 isn't a ridiculous target. I will see you guys on the moon.**", "created_utc": 1587999052.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g92412/dis_dd_repost_aronf32/", "is_self": true}
