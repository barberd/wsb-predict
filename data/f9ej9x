Today I didn't color code the calls/puts   but did color code the  companies.\n\nThese options orders  are on or above the ask. Many have the same expiry and strike. Also lots  of the orders were sweeps so these ppl were breaking down their order  to get filled faster.\n\nAlso all  these orders volume of the contracts exceeded the open interest in  multiple trades so it's most likely not closing positions. Either  buy    to  open orders or sell to open orders and based on the aggressiveness  of the orders one can infer its buy to open. Some of  these may be    hedges  and some most likely not.\n\nData is here -[https://ibb.co/6bcWXq6](https://ibb.co/6bcWXq6)\n\nThe M and Yelp orders seem unusual with the repeating orders.\n\nData is from 9:30-1:25pm or so\n\nI  will say this, don't just enter into positions based on this data     alone in most cases. Use  technicals/fundamentals/options  data-flow/market  sediment all combined  instead of just 1 of these. Use     protection like  spreads if you worry  about losing what u put in  and    be  smart,  understand the risks of putting  $ into weekly  expiry's, consider a longer expiry.", "created_utc": 1582654755, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9ej9x/aggressiveunusual_options_yelptwtrtslaamdm/", "is_self": true}
