{"id": "ct4l8f", "title": "TD Ameritrades' Customer Service is Fucking Amazing", "selftext": "I got flagged for the PDT rule and my account had a restriction put on it. Apparently TD has a one time rule where if you hit the PDT rule, you can contact support and have your account restriction lifted. Not only did they lift the restriction off of the account, I negotiated the trading fees much lower. \n\n Typically I day trade one contract at a time, as I've been getting used to live trading vs. paper and don't want to blow up my account with giant position sizing. Eventually when I develop more comfort I'll go larger on the position sizing, but see previous sentence haha. Anyways I was noticing how much the fees were eating into my P and L's, my average win is 80$ and average loss 30$ before fees, 68% win rate. After fees average win was about 65$ and average loss was about 45$. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPrevious fee on one trade- 6.95 + .75 in 6.95 + .75 out= 14.80 round trip\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCurrent fee per trade-         1.50 in 1.50 out            =  3.00 Round trip\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n14.80 is what, almost 500% more than 3.00? LOL\n\n They also told me once they see that I'm starting to do higher volume (As after 8 contracts or so, the current fee structure will be more expensive) we can re-negotiate the pricing again. So a big shout-out to TD Ameritrade, their customer service is unmatched IMO. I'm a small account size retail guy and they treated me very well.", "created_utc": 1566329240, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ct4l8f/td_ameritrades_customer_service_is_fucking_amazing/", "is_self": true}
