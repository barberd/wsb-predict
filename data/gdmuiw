I have absolutely NO INTENTION OF TRYING TO PUMP, you invest at your own discretion. I personally believe this is the beginning of another Super Bull market for tankers (See the 80\u2019s and mid 2000\u2019s for context) and have 95% of my account invested in the above 3 companies (50% calls and 50% stock). Sorry no NAT for me, more upside on the above companies. I\u2019ll keep this short and let you read the sources yourself:\n\nSKIP TO THE END FOR SOME FUN INFO ON SCORPIO PRESIDENT, ROBERT BUGBEE\n\n**Storage (1):**\n\nWe saw last week that tanker shares took a bit of a hit. Why? In volatile tanker markets, the price of the share often times mimics the daily spot prices for the various VLCC\u2019s, LR2\u2019s, etc. Now it shouldn\u2019t be completely dictated this way due to TC rates, etc., but unfortunately market sediment can drive the price more than hard data. Here is a simple recap of last week:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Tanker stocks in decline last week \\(above\\) compared to spot rates decline last week \\(below\\) ------ I realize the above is only 2 days, the whole week looked the same.](https://preview.redd.it/xo0w9hixntw41.png?width=718&format=png&auto=webp&s=df022769dac9b9902fc0d2cbc40f9eb39715c9b4)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Rates in Decline last week \\(Projected to shoot up in mid May when June contracts expire\\)](https://preview.redd.it/3imkexajotw41.jpg?width=1616&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ced85be58a75348f370f1afeafb0cfa6e872a30c)\n\nHere is a quick recap of how it happened:\n\n1. Some States prepare to partially open. The price of oil increases based on speculation of demand increase. Hence the front month oil futures contract increases, which means\u2026\u2026..\n2. Contango begins to flatten. If you don\u2019t know what this means yet it\u2019s just arbitrage, it\u2019s buying a commodity, in our case an oil contract at a cheaper price today then it will be in 3 months. Oil contract contains a thousand barrels. You buy a contract (1000 barrels) at $15/barrel the contract costs you $15,000, and you then hope to profit at a later date by selling it at $30/barrel, netting a nice profit. Do this with a few thousand contracts and you can be sitting pretty.\n3. Last week we had bad speculation as investors ran screaming after hearing news that daily spot rates decreased....... because obviously we moved away from the most insane Contango in history: remember WTI [as it went negative](https://www.macrotrends.net/1369/crude-oil-price-history-chart)? VLCC\u2019s spot rates dropped from 200k to 100k over the week, oh my gosh, SELL, SELL SELL!!! However most of these gents failed to realize that 100k is still 4x the average rate for years pass.  Yes obviously rates are going to be the highest during the period around oil contract expiration. What they don\u2019t tell you, is at the rate we are using up storage (there is some 160+ million barrels already sitting at sea and 50 million being added per week), if we enter into another Contango for the June contracts which expire on 5/19/2020 (which is looking inevitable), there are projections that daily spot rates could reach 500k/day.\n\n**Storage (2):**\n\n[Cushing](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/macro-voices/id1079172742?i=1000473204536) is building at an incredible rate and while you may see people misinterpret headlines like [this](https://www.manifoldtimes.com/news/oil-glut-set-to-halve-in-may-and-shrink-to-6-million-bpd-in-june-but-storage-cant-breathe/), the fact remains that we are still building the glut, and fast, but an estimated build of [13.6 million](https://www.manifoldtimes.com/news/oil-glut-set-to-halve-in-may-and-shrink-to-6-million-bpd-in-june-but-storage-cant-breathe/) barrels per/day is forecasted for May. If you are out drowning in a pool of oil and you begin to drown a little slower, you're not being rescued and you're not working your way out, you're still drowning buddy. This glut is not being reversed anytime soon. What many don't realize is that much of the Permian is still pumping, yes that's right, many of these companies are hedged through 2020 and will pump as long as there is a pipeline to take it. Contrary to what you might believe, a negative WTI price doesn't meant their losing their books. Oh and let's not forget Russia and SA increased oil production in April to all time highs (below). Lastly, oil works like any other free market, if the price goes up, people will sell more. Oil is not being cut while we quickly and neatly use up all the surplus and then all politely turn our wells back on at the same time. The minute oil increase in price, countries start increasing their production to maximize revenue, the glut starts to build and we go through it again. This surplus isn't being worked off in 6 months, we are talking years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zihmbkm72uw41.png?width=630&format=png&auto=webp&s=88b138aba9ab18f40eea434dac09e56ddd02c9bf\n\n**NAV**\n\nI dont have the energy for this as everything is bullish and you can't google it without seeing the undervalue. Most of the above companies are still trading below Net Asset Value (NAV), meaning if they went belly up today and had to sell all assets and turn around and pay of debt, guess what, there would still be enough left over to pay share holders more than the current stock price. STNG last week was trading at \\~75% NAV which is ludicrous. After today it's still trading below NAV and right before an earnings drop where we have seen some of the highest LR2 rates ever.\n\n**Closing (This is it!)**\n\nCheck out this interview from [Robert Bugbee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkLM6gx7E8), CEO of STNG, and watch that mad lad say at the 2019 Annual Product Shipping Forum LAST YEAR, that due to IMO 2020, STNG was going to increase in price by 50% (At about 7:45 time in the video), which it did last year, before tankers got hammered in the beginning of the year along with everyone else. Now with IMO 2020 and the Covid supply glut, I wonder what he is going to say Wednesday when earnings drop lol, my guess is stonks go into orbit. Oh and did I forget to mention, that same Mr. Bugbee bought 2 million calls on STNG in March. Granted his strike and premiums were a little more attractive lol, [HE IS ONE OF US!](http://classicvalueinvestors.com/2020/04/15/president-of-scorpio-tankers-speaking/) He is the way, do not miss this earnings and guidance forecast with STNG.\n\nTL;DR ------- You need to be in this trade, not just options, buy shares as well for some monster dividends. Yes that's right stocks, instead of Yolo'ing your entire savings away on 30% OTM Tesla puts you can make some serious cash off these tankers for the next 6 months...... Then go blow it all, but at least do one thing right before you go down in flames.\n\nDOUBLE TL;DR ------- Listen to the above interview with Robert Bugbee and keep in mind he has $millions in calls on STNG (yes he does this legally), and let that sweet bit of information rock you to sleep tonight.\n\nTRIPLE TL;DR -------- You still have not missed the boat. STNG is going to the stratosphere Wednesday and EURN on Thursday when earnings come out.\n\n**POSITIONS**\n\n[Picking up a lot more STNG tomorrow](https://preview.redd.it/qcvv0vhj3uw41.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=9cb2295eea2a809ddb98c4b4cbb9a582ec2a5a2e)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lq30j3mm3uw41.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ee5a289b484d6b22c9cae6ff9e67b92cef40f30\n\nAt the end of the day what do I know.
