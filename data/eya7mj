{"id": "eya7mj", "title": "China Class A stocks are only traded overnight", "selftext": "Its not that we fucked up buying FXI. If you came in early you still made profit. But when it comes down to the behavior we'll be seeing this week, GTFO out of FXI. \n\nThe Chinese market does not operate like the US market. Chinese trading floors classify stocks in 3 categories.\n\nA shares. Can only be traded using RMB currency. These are all your small cap, mid cap, and some large cap stocks. These stocks are the heart of China and represent Chinese health. They can only be traded by Chinese investors, and their exposure to foreign investment is highly limited.\n\nB shares. Can be traded using foreign currency. They are mostly large cap, and are traded not just on the Chinese floors, but on foreign floors as well. Think Taiwan. Think Tokyo. Think Hong Kong.\n\nH shares. Can only be traded using Hong Kong dollars and are traded on HK only.\n\nThink about it. The Chinese stock exchanges were closed for 10 days. Those are the ones that hold the investments of nationals. Those are the ones that will be having massive sell offs due to sell order build up. Last night, the SSE and A50 (tracking A shares) reached the -8% almost instantly at open. Meanwhile, the markets that trade B and H shares (HK, Taiwan, and Tokyo SE) have all been open and those companies have slowly been bleeding out with no volatility build up. \n\nI can expect overnight behavior to be consistent throughtout the week. FXI/EWT/EWH/DXJ might keep spiking up due to the CCP liquidity injections going mostly towards the companies \"too big too fail\", that is, those that are listed on Shanghai, HK, Taiwain, Tokyo markets. Meanwhile, the smaller A share companies will keep tanking overnight as Chiense investors pull out to have liquid cash. I will close all my FXI/EWT/EWH/DXJ positions and go into ASHR/CHAU/KBA, which track both A and B type shares. \n\nIf Im right, those will tank by tomorrow morning, while FXI will keep spiking up. Not worth the risk holding onto FXI at the moment. ASHR offers the same reward at much lower risk. \n\nAlso, I know this will fall on deaf ears but stop asking me about getting 3-5 DTE. Dont be retarded. Go at least 2 weeks out.\n\nSee you all in bankruptcy court.", "created_utc": 1580749756, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eya7mj/china_class_a_stocks_are_only_traded_overnight/", "is_self": true}
