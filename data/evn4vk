{"id": "evn4vk", "title": "Jokes Aside - Everyone Please Be Careful", "selftext": "I know we all joke around telling everyone there on the spectrum. However, I want to be serious for a second. I'm seeing a lot of investors jumping out of stocks with a 5 year 300% run up on 75% year over year returns, low PE, and solid profits report. Then buying into stocks that have a lot of hype around them. Please be careful about what you're investing in right now, one big reversal will cush the trendies. Buying into bubbles is an easy way to hand all your money over to institutional investors. I just want to say make sure you're researching your stock picks and have at least some understanding of the market your buying into.", "created_utc": 1580305924, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/evn4vk/jokes_aside_everyone_please_be_careful/", "is_self": true}
