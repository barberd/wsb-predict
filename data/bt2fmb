Wasn\u2019t sure if I should use DD flair.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest Chinese chipmakers is delisting from the New York Stock Exchange amid the trade war, but the company said the decision is not related to the heightened tensions between the United States and China.\nSemiconductor Manufacturing International, a Shanghai-based component manufacturer worth $5.4 billion, has notified the NYSE it will apply for the voluntary delisting of its American depositary shares, or those that trade on a U.S. exchange, the company said in a statement Friday. The last day of trading of the ADSs on the NYSE will be on or about June 13.\nThe motivation for the withdrawal is that the company's American depositary receipts listing in the U.S. sees \"low trading volume and high costs,\" Semiconductor Manufacturing told CNBC. The company's main listing is in Hong Kong.\u201d", "created_utc": 1558835331, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bt2fmb/smic_says_it_plans_to_delist_from_nyse_in_a_month/", "is_self": true}
