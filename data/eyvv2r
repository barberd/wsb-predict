I still think it\u2019s got room to run but definitely not nearly as much as it has over the past few months and possibly approaching a big correction (I\u2019m probably wrong, inverse me pls). However, through this sub I\u2019ve been seeing the same hype around SPCE as there was around TSLA months ago when it was relatively cheap. I\u2019m not missing another opportunity like TSLA so I\u2019m going to ball out on these SPCE calls. Picked up some far dated calls today (01/21) for a 30 strike and was wondering which fucking dates/strikes you tards are playing and what\u2019s the game plan going further?\n\nTL;DR strikes/expiration on SPCE calls to fuel my raging coke addiction?", "created_utc": 1580845858, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eyvv2r/spce_is_the_next_tsla/", "is_self": true}
