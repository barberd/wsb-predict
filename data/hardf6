This is one of the few stocks I\u2019ve found that hasn\u2019t ripped past it\u2019s yearly high post covid even though it involves an activity that you could do pretty much entirely through the shutdown. In fact, golf courses have been crushing it from what I\u2019ve seen because you can still practice social distancing there which has been driving even more traffic then usual because other activities were shut down. If golf courses are doing well, chances are people are buying clubs still. \n\nThe play:\nI\u2019m opening calls around 8/21 which is a couple weeks after earnings. Depending on how things go I may sell before earnings. \n\nPositions:\nELY $18C 8/21\n\n\n\n[positions ](https://ibb.co/PWHLknt)", "created_utc": 1592401404.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hardf6/callaway_a_hidden_gem/", "is_self": true}
