{"id": "cz530k", "title": "BYND borrow rate at IB is 317%", "selftext": "This is nuts. There are no shares left to borrow and the rate jumped from 78% on Friday to 317% today. Unless they gave me the wrong info, this means the short squeeze is likely to happen soon. \n\nI\u2019m using about 5% of the profits from my first BYND run-up trade on this one, so I have an incredibly high risk tolerance. I don\u2019t mind losing it if I\u2019m wrong. Please don\u2019t blindly follow me and do your own due diligence. This is not a recommendation to do anything. \n\nI own calls that range from $220-$300 with expirations from 9/20 to Nov 15th (I think those are the dates). \n\nIf you wake up with chicken nuggets in your mouth and a beautiful woman (or man) in your bed, don\u2019t fear. For you are in Elysium, and your calls are already dead! \ud83d\udc0e \u2694\ufe0f", "created_utc": 1567518361, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cz530k/bynd_borrow_rate_at_ib_is_317/", "is_self": true}
