Calls $23-28 March 20 capitalize on big volume or may options for earnings $25+**\n\n**Solar doesn't seem affected by \ud83c\udf08 \ud83d\udc3b beer virus. Sun keeps shining**\n\nThis is what I'm talking about. You see those solar panels in the rich neighborhoods? That's SunRun. It's the perfect company for middle-upper class suburban normies to feel better about their footprint and so all the housewives can tell eachother how green they are. Super foods? Nah. Kale chips? Nah. Solar panels motherfucker. This shit right here:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/TzSjcJA.png\n\nEven bestbuy is getting on board selling this shit.\n\nSunRun takes the hard part out of the equation. Their solar panels and batteries are resold Panasonic equipment. Panasonic just canceled their solar panel deal with TSLA, but they're still strong with SunRun:\n\nhttps://marketwatch.com/story/panasonic-drops-out-of-solar-panel-partnership-with-tesla-2020-02-26\n\nPanasonic knows its easier to just pump these mother fuckers out to companies like SunRun than form some \ud83c\udf08 \ud83d\udc3b partnership with Tesla.\n\nSunrun is in my area (MA) and they're booming, look at this:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/R8FuX7I.png\n\nThey're pumping out offices to sell solar panels to housewives at an extreme rate. It's already all over California. They even formed a partnership with my energy company, and our energy company gives us incentives to go with Sunrun.\n\n**Company Hiring**\n\nLet's focus on their hiring for a second. They're hiring a billion retards for their massive growth:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/AZOAtaF.png\n\n687 Listings on LinkedIn, 500 on indeed, more on their website. Anything from Software Engineers to VPs to marketers, etc.\n\nThey're in the process of expanding their company nationwide and hiring out the yahoo to do so, practically handing out jobs. One of their main issues last year was they couldn't hire enough retards to sell this shit, what kind of company can say that.\n\nOnce a housewife buys this shit, she tells all her friends and they **cuck the fuck out of their husbands to get solar panels too.** Even better SunRun is ran by an empowered super woman. Check out this article showing you how brave and strong she is:\n\nhttps://nytimes.com/2020/01/23/business/lynn-jurich-sunrun.html\n\n**Earnings**\n\nGood or bad earnings, these guys JUMP insanely on earnings news. Next earnings date is in May.\n\nQ3 2019: Beat EPS by 450%\n\nQ4 2019: Missed EPS but beat Revenue\n\nThis is normal during a hyper-growth stage, more money is being put into company spending, they're also buying back stock, opening new offices, hiring a billion people, etc. It's no worry as revenue did not miss, which is what you'd expect. Plus who the fuck buys solar panels in the winter?\n\nThey are floating **a ton of cash** for a company their size. Their assets are dank AF and show they're getting ready to POP. Don't believe the \ud83c\udf08 \ud83d\udc3bthat tried to downplay sunrun last earnings, they have already recovered, eating away all the losses.\n\n**Take a look at any neighborhood near you on Google Satellite, and you'll see just how popular solar panels are getting, its the next big thing. Buy whatever the housewives want, they control their husbands.**\n\n**Volume**\n\nThey have great volume for their size surprisingly. I haven't played the options market with them yet, but it seems like a steady amount of activity, mostly bullish. \n\n**Here is some of their option activity I've seen by major investors:**\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/N5XE59B.png\n\n**Recent off the market print @22.47 a share (current $20.22):**\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/y0SkDWy.png\n\nThat's an 18% volume print.\n\n**Competitors and Similar Companies:**\n\nSunRun is a bit unique, they don't seem to have any competition that is moving this fast, spreading to this many markets, etc. \n\n**One of their main competitors was SolarCity, and SolarCity is dead, and Tesla Solar (solarcity) just lost their Panasonic partnership.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI think SunRun is in a position to greatly grow their company, they're already expanding at a ludicrous rate, hiring as many employees as they can, and emerging in new cities, forming deals with local energy companies for incentives to the buyer, etc. I knew nothing about them until my energy company National Grid sent me information about them. They've mailed pamphlets to all their customers, and in MA we care a lot about sustainable energy (we even get to pick if we want our energy to come from renewable resources).\n\nWith the recent market activity regarding them, it seems that the major investors are waking up to this too. With the recent downside we've seen across the market, they're sitting at a very tolerable price for new investors.\n\nFor options taking into consideration the bullish major investor purchasing, I'd say any March 20 calls ($23,$24,$25,$27,$28) to capitalize on any pop and for an earnings play, you'd want May 20 ($25+). They're pretty cheap you could pick up a few yolos for 20 in tendies.\n\n**TDLR no big brain cant read post:**\n\n**$RUN**\n\n**TLDR: Company go big boom many money. wife cuck husband make him buy solar panel.
