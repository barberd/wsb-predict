Here's how this plays out.", "selftext": "The whole world is sitting on their asses, doing nothing but consuming food (and buying toilet paper and coughing and/or dying).  Brace yourself for this...\n\nThe United States is the largest exporter of food products worldwide.\n\nPeople are going to get used to not spending money because they're not making money.  They're going to get used to not buying useless garbage that is made in China.  You know what they are going to buy?  Food.  You know where they're going to buy it from?  The US.  Why?  Because that's where the food grows.\n\nThere will be a point where people are going to be buying up food as if it were toilet paper.  Take corn as an example.  You can eat it, and you can wipe your cornholes with the husks.  Whiskey comes from corn.\n\nThe problem with food is that it is perishable.  You can't store it in your garage like you can toilet paper.  When people can't find toilet paper in the stores, you can sell rolls at any price you want.  People will pay more when they are desperate.  What about food?  This is where futures come in.  When you buy a futures contract, you are buying that food right now - but you're not taking delivery of it right now.  The farmers need to grow it first.  When the time comes, you will be able to sell your food for a lot more than you paid for it.  You know what's not going to get cheaper in the coming months?  Food.\n\nZC - Corn\n\nZW - Wheat\n\nZO - Oats\n\nZR - Rice\n\nZS - Soybeans", "created_utc": 1585889243.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fu1yf2/im_from_the_futures_heres_how_this_plays_out/", "is_self": true}
