I'll admit, this idea is probably so retarded that merely by posting this I should qualify for some disability benefits or at least park in the handicapped spot. My main idea is this: if the trade talks coming this October between Mango and Big Daddy Xi blows up and tariffs are implemented or a temporary deal isn't reached, SPY should have another pullback of roughly 5-7% just like it had numerous times before when trade tensions escalated in the past, but wouldn't developments like this only raise the probability of more Fed rate cuts? Wouldn't the threat of increased economic headwinds only raise speculations of that fabled 50bp cut from our bae JPow? Shouldn't this speculation only increase bullish sentiment in the short run after the pullback? Also if tariffs are raised, shouldn't a lot of the effects on the consumer be mitigated through the depreciation of the Yuan and companies absorbing some of the increased costs in their supply chain? \n\n*goes back to snacking on crayons and chalk.", "created_utc": 1568983045, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d6uaid/trade_fears_good_for_stocks/", "is_self": true}
