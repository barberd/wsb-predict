{"id": "ffti72", "title": "Weak Hands", "selftext": "I had SPY and RCL puts that I sold last week at significant profit, but I'm fucking pissed now. I missed out on so many tendies. I had 70% ROI with my RCL puts, but would have made at least 300% ROI if I held it for an extra week. It's difficult not to be really hard on myself for being weak. I did some research and I expected the market to continue tanking, but I sold early like a weak bitch anyways. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWho else is pissed for selling puts too early? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm eager to get back in the game. Looking at DIS, OXY and DAL puts that expire in July.", "created_utc": 1583754797.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffti72/weak_hands/", "is_self": true}
