{"id": "f2bw5b", "title": "two accounts to minimize autism", "selftext": "I have a Fidelity account where I trade shares, and mutual funds. Its safe, boring, and profitable. Got bored and wanted to start trading options so I opened up a RH account and got to work. My RH account grew from $100 to $1000 back to $400 in a month. Point being options trading is fun but my god this is no one to make a living. Throw a majority of your money into shares and fiddle with options using the rest. Its kept my exposure low, my risk minimal, and the fun high. 10/10 would reccomend for all of yall making huge gains on options to throw some of it into shares. Now here come the small pp jokes.", "created_utc": 1581443129, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f2bw5b/two_accounts_to_minimize_autism/", "is_self": true}
