This is one of the forecasting tools I have in my toolbox.  The way to read these is to not so much to focus on the magnitude, but the points of trend change.  Many of these are showing weakness expected to occur until through February into early/mid March.  Based on the WuTangFlu/Beervirus this may have a good chance of being in the cards.  Good luck trading  WSB4eva", "created_utc": 1580684839, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/exx4rj/charts_for_kids_who_dont_read_good_or_do_other/", "is_self": true}
