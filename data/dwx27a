{"id": "dwx27a", "title": "AMZN Question", "selftext": "Hey guys, kind of freaking out and I would like someone to talk me down here. \n\nSo I\u2019ve been playing with options for a few months now, mainly just simple buying outs calls.  A couple of weeks ago I wanted more consistency co I started selling credit spreads with pretty minimal risk. \n\nI had a trade expire today and I want to make sure I\u2019m thinking about it correctly. Last week I opened an Amazon put credit spread where I was short the 1770 strike and long the 1767.5 so at the time my max loss would have been $250 minus the $31 in credit I received. \n\nWell amazon obviously tanked today and both options ended up way ITM. Robinhood (go figure) told me multiple times they would close the position at 3. This never happened so I tried to close it myself and it got rejected. Both contracts are expired now but Robinhood never closes the positions as was supposed to happen. \n\nWhat happens now??? \n\nThank you!!!", "created_utc": 1573852600, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dwx27a/amzn_question/", "is_self": true}
