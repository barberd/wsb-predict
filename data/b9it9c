{"id": "b9it9c", "title": "No one talking Cloud Tech?", "selftext": "Sperg stuff here - posting some cloud-tech trades/buys since I'm not seeing any posts about them. \n\nWe have an event an hour before open tomorrow called job's report. Regardless of directional opinion, job's report is very important, and if it's optimistic I'm going to aspie trade tech as tech got killed today. I buy a range of expiry's depending on the trade I'm making. Tickers &amp; PTs:\n\nZS back to 70 &amp; above\nCYBR to 120 May\nOKTA to 90 late April\nCRM 160 April 5/12 or 160 ER play\nZEN 85 April 12 or 85/90 ER play\nAYX 85 April 18 \nTTD 220 June/210 May 10 (day after ER, sell calls against this...)\nHUBS 170 May\nSHOP 200 April 12\nNOW 250 April 26 for ER\nMDB 150 May 3\nESTC 90 May/100 June\nNTNX 40 (weekly gamma scalp)\n\nI've been following these for a bit now and always trade what I know. I buy both long dated options, shares, weekly/monthlies, gamma scalp/delta neutral, and sperg FDs. I've been trading TTD AYX NTNX ZS this past two weeks &amp; will probably continue to do so. Too many tickers here to trade but all good ideas IMO. Thinking about making a bullish summer ESTC trade for after lockup expiration along with CRM OKTA NTNX. I currently own ZS CRM CYBR TTD ZEN AYX NTNX ESTC. \n\nAnyone else keeping their eyes on the tech drop today? \n\nDo your own research and make your own calls, just sharing mine. \n\n\n", "created_utc": 1554414195, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b9it9c/no_one_talking_cloud_tech/", "is_self": true}
