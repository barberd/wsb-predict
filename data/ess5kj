My question to you is why haven't you climbed aboard this rocketship? \"They have 0 profit on the books,\" \"only rich people are gonna do this, it'll never become mainstream,\" \"yeah maybe in 30 years it'll be a good stock\". Fuck all you naysayers. This bad boy is going to Saturn and beyond with or without you, so I suggest you hop on before it's too late. \n\nThe recent volume is nuts. People want in this. Short interest is 22.30%. If this moonwalk upwards continues, a small short squeeze isn't out of the question.\n\nSo again I ask you all, what the fuck are you doing? Get in this thing and go to Tendfinity and Beyond with the rest of us SPCE Cadets.", "created_utc": 1579781068, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ess5kj/yeah_yeah_yeah_another_spce_post/", "is_self": true}
