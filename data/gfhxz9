{"id": "gfhxz9", "title": "Unusual options activity on ERI (El Dorado Resorts)", "selftext": "**TLDR: I advise buying June 19 20 Calls on ERI.**\n\nOn May 6, significant, and unusual, blocks of options were traded on ERI. A deep-pocketed buyer, likely an institution, made a bullish purchase of approx. 5000 6/19 20C's at the Ask, and a sale of the same amount of 30C's near the Bid. This bullish call was despite the falling price action that day. This represents 500k shares, or approximately 5-10% of daily volume on any given day.\n\n\nWhat makes this even more unusual is the fact that the open interest on either of those options before the purchase was less than 1000 contracts, meaning this was an incredibly large buy. Moreover, none of the other casino stocks seemed to have experienced a large bullish buy like this.\n\n\nFor a quick overview of ERI: Eldorado Resorts is an American hotel and casino entertainment company founded and based in Reno, Nevada that operates 23 properties across 11 U.S. states. In 2019, they entered into a merger agreement with Caesars Entertainment for $18 billion in stock and cash. The merger is expected to be completed by the start of the summer.\n\n\nBecause ERI had to resolve anti-trust issues with the merger, they've sold off numerous properties to buyers. Most of these sales were in late 2019. Despite these sales, the casinos are bleeding cash in this climate. In particular, the largest problem is the rent issue.\n\n\nThe fact that **the trade was a vertical spread**, rather than a naked option purchase, means there is still time to get in on the trade. **For the mysterious buyer to make any money, the price must go into the mid-20s over the next 2-3 weeks.** Even with the news on Nevada taking action to reopen casinos, the stock still closed at $19.38 today.\n\n\nI expect a couple of potential catalysts to drive the price above $20 in the next few weeks:\n- ERI successfully renegotiates its lease on some of the properties for the year\n- ERI executes another favorable sale on a property, deleveraging its financial position\n- ERI gets approval to reopen its Casinos before rivals do.\n\nAs always, this is just my opinion. It is obviously risky to trade hospitality / live entertainment stocks in a pandemic like this. So do your own DD before you take any action.", "created_utc": 1588894746.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gfhxz9/unusual_options_activity_on_eri_el_dorado_resorts/", "is_self": true}
