I did this with both INO and SPY\n\n I sold a put credit spread early in the day, when the stock started peaking, I purchased my short position back for less than I sold it for, and then as the stocks dropped, I waited until my long position was higher than what I purchased it for, and then sold.\n\nRobinhood screwing me over...\nI did this with ino at 11 and 10 strike.. anfter buying back the 11 the stock eventually sunk down to 8 something and right when i went to sell the 10 put, RH froze and showed all options at .01 and then once ino went up to 9.50, all of a sudden it let me sell it ... what the actual fack\n\nAlso. I'm now forced diamond hands on some spy puts because I had 3 day trades today, please keep tanking", "created_utc": 1583792130, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fg2znu/is_this_a_strategy_anyone_uses_also_rh_screwed_me/", "is_self": true}
