Ouch. \n\nThey recently announced they will be resuming full flight capacity on July 1st. Other airlines are not doing this yet. This tells me that they have serious cash flow problems compared to the other airlines. They are a serious bankruptcy risk  in the future, and the street is slowly realizing they are more fucked than other airlines. \n\n52 week low in the next week or two.\n\nSELL SELL SELL IF YOU ROBINHOOD TARDS ARE STILL HOLDING THE STOCK. BUY PUTS!\n\n7/2 9p and 7/10 8.5p", "created_utc": 1593191304.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hgbk8q/aal_is_double_fuk/", "is_self": true}
