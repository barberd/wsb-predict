What's going up tends to go higher.\n\nHowever AMZN is still about 14% from its highs, and is a big weight in the S&amp;P. The other companies have pushed SPY this far. Some random catalyst will push AMZN to 2k+ and SPY will pump to new heights before any bubble will pop.", "created_utc": 1576439751, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eb3pri/how_to_short_the_doomsday_bubble/", "is_self": true}
