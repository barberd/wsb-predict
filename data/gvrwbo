Some notes:\n\n* You could play down to 296p, challenge is if we don't move with velocity, you'll be stuck in a position with less interest, that takes far more movement to push price, higher risk\n* I'll be playing higher, likely in the 303 to 306 range\n* I favor the 6/10 strike, as I expect all movement by Mon-Tues, and might be out by Friday.  6/12 is also an option, as is 6/8 for the high risk lotto plays.\n\n# Why\n\nI base this play on the oscillators and MACD indicators, among other TA.  Some notes:\n\n* ES 3h oscillator has pushed above 52 now for the 4th time\n* SPY 3h oscillator is also forming a 4th top, the first blew off 2.91 points, the second blew off 2.83, the third blew of 6.81, this fourth peak should exceed the third in both duration and depth\n* Playing the downside is harder, it will move quick when it does\n* Velocity can increase when we're this overbought, meaning we can pop upwards from here, 316 forms the upper range of current targets, and I expect a quick snap down of around 12 points.  I don't think we hit 316 before plunging, we could fail our 309 test and drop.  The higher we climb, the nastier the initial fall.\n* MACD has not crossed over, it's a reliable indicator, though lagging, so I try to guess ahead\n* 3h oscillator looks like it wants to flash sell, though hasn't yet.  At these levels, it's a reliable indicator, slightly less lagging than MACD, but also more prone to fakeouts\n* On ES, 1d oscillator is at highest level since Jan 24, 4h at highest since Apr 30th, 2h is oversold flashing sell, 1h flashed sell during AH and is about to have a MACD crossover\n\n[https://imgur.com/QMQYDAj](https://imgur.com/QMQYDAj)\n\n# So what to do\n\nFor now, don't do anything.  It's too early, literally and figuratively, to enter.  We've started a trend of rising overnight and selling into open.  We might do the same today.  The only way I consider entering at open is if we sell out under 3080, we're at 3091 now.  Rather I know I'm going to play this, and will be searching for an entry.  I expect to enter today, but that's not a guarantee.  \n\nIf you'd like to play along, or even just watch and laugh as my money does a vanishing act, you're welcome to.  This isn't a good day for me, numerous real life aspects pulling me away, but I will do my best.\n\nAs always, I'll be transparent about my positions, including date, contracts, average, and movement.  Will share TA I'm watching as well.  I expect an initial buy of around $1000-$2000, might double or triple position as averaging dictates.\n\n**Side note:** I don't believe this is a further leg down, this is a healthy reset to burn off steam on a strong upward climb.", "created_utc": 1591182111.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gvrwbo/the_normie_playbook_play_the_dip_part_two/", "is_self": true}
