However, I feel it's not having enough attention.", "selftext": "First of all, AMD made its comeback into the industry and kicks intel in the ass which is amazing.\n\nHowever I wanna share the AMD standpoint in term as a stock to buy so, \"imma try keep my biased ass low key.\"\n \nFirst of all, Supply&amp;demand. Semi- conductor industry all faced the problem of trading relations between countries. Intel is like the prime examples for this, it's incapablility to meet Apple's need. AMD on the another hand spread their supply over the globe, even though most of which depend on Asia. They are well prepared to meet their demands in any events of the unexpected. HERES LINKS TO COMPARE.(Straight from company Websites so no biasness) \n\n[Intel Statement On Nov20, 2019](https://newsroom.intel.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/11/intel-supply-letter-customers.pdf)\n\n[AMD Supply Chain Responsibility.](https://www.amd.com/en/corporate-responsibility/supplier)\n\nApple hate on the inconsistency when comes to supply and demand. Big companies wants stable growth and Intel is doing a poor job. Setting that aside, performance wise.... Intel is not being the best choice with apple's product. Intel is the opposite of what apple entirely strikes for. Apple absolutely care about the comfort of its own device brings. I am not a big fan of Apple but their product is delicate. Intel is currently used in Apple's Mac's and it produce way more heat than AMD threadripper3990X which is bad for performance and the user experience. *Google it yourself, too much link to compare*\n\nWith the rumours going around that Intel is gonna get dropped by Apple, chances of it happening is going up. AMD is going to be the most obvious candidate for it, better performance and being a better business partner than intel. However,  life is life so there are chances that Apple drop intel but doesn't pick AMD. So here's the possibility of Apple being capable in supplying their own chip.{Very slim, don't forget I am convincing you to support AMD} The possibility is that they are developing their own ARM processors which I say that Apple is good in R&amp;D but no fucking way they can outdo Semi conductor companies who been focusing on CPU chips since the beginning of the existence of their company. I am sure Apple can get it done if they want, but I am confident it wouldn't be anytime soon.\nIt would be a dumb idea to start R&amp;D conversion right now without any supplies, they would still pick AMD while doing their R&amp;D.\n\nImma leave some links below for you guys to read up on, if I convinced anyone. However, it's only my opinion and I don't see the fall of intel but just strongly believe the rise of AMD stock price.\n\n[ARM Processor, (No Specs details) ](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/ARM-processor)\n[Just a reference to Apple pace.
