May we canonize him as our saint \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b.\n\nEdit: Given that the contracts were probably trading at 1-5c premiums then since WTI was trading at $20, this guy would have maybe 3000x his investment. Possible $10k -> $3M at least?\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-07/somebody-just-bet-10-000-on-wti-oil-at-50-cents-a-barrel\n\n\"Can West Texas Intermediate crude fall beneath 50 cents a barrel? Someone thinks so.\n\nA trader bought 1,000 put options on the U.S. crude benchmark that would profit a buyer from WTI slumping toward almost zero value. The unlikely bet cost just $10,000.\n\nCheap at Half a Dollar\nHoldings of oil put options at $10 and below on the rise\n\nSource: Nymex, Bloomberg\n\nNOTE: Figures as of April 6\n\nWTI is down 56% this year, and some obscure corners of the U.S. market have even seen negative prices. But a drop below $1 for headline prices seems a long shot. Still, traders have been snapping up contracts that would profit from crude at phenomenally low levels. The number of put options at $10 or below has jumped in recent weeks, with more than 50,000 options now held and much of the growth within the last month.\n\nFor now, attempts by global producers to agree on output cuts are likely to ward off the possibility of oil trading in the single digits. With global consumption in freefall and crude volatility at unprecedented levels, the 50-cent trade looks more like a lottery ticket hedging against a prolonged demand collapse.\"", "created_utc": 1587429507.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g551le/they_laughed_at_him/", "is_self": true}
