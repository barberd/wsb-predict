I\u2019m your host and resident autist u/expander2. You have to be able to read to gain anything from this so that rules out about half of you. As always, this is organized from most important at the top to least important at the bottom. A TLDR, plays, and previous DD summaries will be at the bottom. My last posts still stand and hold some good info so check it out for more plays if this isn't enough for you greedy fucks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWelcome back Fuzzy, today we start with you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**LYV;** We all love when u/fuzzyblankeet makes us look like autistic cavemen in comparison to his glorious intellect. Well folks, he has done it again. His[most recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g69ccz/lyv_free_or_die_fuzzys_live_nation_breakdown/) goes through Live Nation (LYV). We get a breakdown of the company, their debt, the covenant and flexibility, and get some great takeaways. Now, fuzzy refuses to think for us because he (like a good daddy would) wants us to think for ourselves and get learned. I, however, love upvotes so I will gladly tell you smooth brained retards exactly what you can take away from fuzzy's post. Live Nation will make it through the pandemic easily. They have a spread out debt portfolio that is manageable and a shit ton of cash on hand. So you are all thinking, \u201cGreat, they are gonna be fine, no use in buying puts. Guess I'll find a different play.\u201d and you are so fucking wrong I should break your legs. THEY HAVE A LOT OF CASH. This means that once we are through this, they will continue with the same business model they have been using and buy up mid-sized venues, smaller ticketing competitors, and TOTALLY DOMINANT in their market. Companies like Ticketfly, that have no money, will go under and will be bought further consolidating the industry. Live Nation will be an even bigger company than they are now and will absolutely go up in value. What can you take away from this? LONG CALLS. I know they aren't as fun. I know you have to be patient and that sucks but in the long run, you will make money. It's like buying Facebook before they bought Instagram. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**OIL;** Next we have oil in general. Everyone knows that tankers are a great play. What most people don't know is that land based oil storage is also going to rise. There are a lot of companies that offer land based storage but these companies are low volume and cheap options plays (Low volume doesn't mean you can't make money, I'll get into it later). According [to this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6tybe/best_oil_play/), MPLX, PAA, PBFX, DKL, SHLX, CNXM, MMP, PAGP are all good bets when it comes to making money from land based storage. All most of these companies also report earnings in the beginning of May so If you want a firm expiry I would say buy calls expiring late May/ early June. Oil WILL MAKE MONEY and I will endorse this myself. I plan to buy in next week. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SBUX;**  Last, is Starbucks (SBUX). Now I don't do this often but I am going to inverse the post I am citing. Like the OP [of this post said](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g78e7a/starbucks_sbux_guaranteed_earnings_play_lock_of/), Starbucks is coming off a good year. 9% global revenue growth, 539 New Stores (6% increase over prior year), American store sales up 6%, 3% increase in average ticket, returned $1.6 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. This is all great shit. Yes, they have a lot of stores closed, but drive by one of the open ones. There are lines weaving through the parking lots ALL DAY. They do not stop taking orders as long as they are open. BECKY will have her coffee no matter if there is a pandemic or a fucking tornado. I haven't looked into their 10-K or debt structure so I can't help with that but my belief is that they will make it through this fine.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**VOLUME;** Okay last thing. JUST BECAUSE THERE IS NOT MUCH VOLUME, DOES NOT MEAN YOU CANT MAKE MONEY. When you sell a position you don\u2019t have to just hit send. Lower the price closer to the bid and it\u2019ll get sold. Let\u2019s say you buy a call for .36. This then goes up next week to being worth 1.44 however the highest bid is only 1.27. Instead of going to sell at 1.44, drop the price down to 1.35 and take the gains instead of hoping that they move the bid up. A gain of .91 to .99 is still good even if it is technically worth 1.08. Lock in what you have gained instead of being greedy. As long as there are more than 0 bids you can make money. There doesn\u2019t have to be a ton of volume. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck fuckers and tune in on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for more WSB DD Summaries!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR;**  Live Nation will be fine and will do great long term, Land based oil storage is a good bet, Starbucks will do fine, Low volume does not equal no gains.\n\n**Plays;** Long LYV calls, MPLX, PAA, PBFX, DKL, SHLX, CNXM, MMP, and PAGP calls for late May/early June, SBUX calls for late May/early June.\n\n**Previous WSB DD Summaries;**[ 4/14-4/15](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1x0y4/dd_from_414415_echostar_hasbro_yelp_and_shit_tldr/),[ 4/16-4/20](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g50ip3/dd_from_416420_dis_shop_and_bear_porn_tldr_and/), [4/21-4/22](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g68ny9/dd_from_421422_activision_tyson_square_and_gains/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDISCLAIMER; I am not personally advocating for any play that I add to this list.
