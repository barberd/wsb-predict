ALWAYS, until how, have gotten raped by the bulls.\n\nLast Friday at EOD I bought some SQQQ shares. Looks like Monday we are down again. (Yay!) I want to average in bearish bets that the Trade War won't get resolved, hence business investments won't be made, expensive supply-chain adjustments may start, and profits will decline.\n\nShould I continue to buy SQQQ or the like? Should I also buy some long expiry puts? Or should I risk a range of puts expiring in, say, 1, 6, 12, 18 months? Should I devote some effort to finding individual STONKS that by virtue of their involvement with China, or poor management, or other factors are destined to tank EVEN WORSER than the general market?\n\n If you are a bear like me, what are you planning on doing LT, not just for a day or two next week?", "created_utc": 1566775970, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cvg19m/long_term_bear_asks_has_trump_finally_screwed_the/", "is_self": true}
