There might not be another health crisis like this in China for another 2 years.\n\nThey're modernizing after all and these things may happen less and less. Buy up the fear. Capitalize on the market's depression. Cast your ethics and morals aside and be a fucking profiteer of the viral epidemic.\n\nHop of the bandwagon for Luckin Coffee (LK), NIO (NIO) and Alibaba (BABA) if you haven't already. Use your autistic powers to feel for the bottom of this viral infested market, they must be good for something right?\n\nWarm hugs and kisses,\nLiquidityMan", "created_utc": 1580107220, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/euk7rc/dont_spill_your_luckin_coffee_in_my_fucking_lap/", "is_self": true}
