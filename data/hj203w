{"id": "hj203w", "title": "U/rawtheory is a genius and I'll prove it!", "selftext": "yesterday I stumbled upon u/rawtheory 's post on the correlation between $TSLA stock performance and google search traffic for \"tesla stock.\" I figured, why not test this random theory, so I created this! An 12 month graph of TSLA stock with search traffic and the peaks of said search traffic,  defined as a local peak with <= 3 points next to it.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/hj1uvv/oc\\_google\\_search\\_traffic\\_for\\_tesla\\_stock\\_an/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/hj1uvv/oc_google_search_traffic_for_tesla_stock_an/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)\n\nInterestingly, every peak either preceded a pullback or located the valley minimum. Interesting, random, definitely stupid. Regardless, props to u/rawtheory.\n\nedit: $TSLA 900p 7/2", "created_utc": 1593572057.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hj203w/urawtheory_is_a_genius_and_ill_prove_it/", "is_self": true}
