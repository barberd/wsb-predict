I'm betting on a crash this month so some of my bias is going to be wrapped up in this, fuck u. Anything can happen in this market though, so who knows we might hit spy 420 July 12.\n\nWhy you should listen to me : June 9 I made [this video](https://vm.tiktok.com/JeXNEKL/) with some horrific, flawed math trying to prove we'd overwhelm our healthcare system 13 days later. June 22nd CA and NYC shutdown. Again fuck u the math there is flawed etc. but since that date had some significance last time around I decided to model when we'd run out of ICU capacity in CA during this surge\n\nThesis : last go around we had a declining R for several weeks before lockdown. People started WFH, large events shut down, behavior changed. At some point several months later I got inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fyqgre/itll_soon_be_apparent_that_the_us_is_going_to/?utm_source=BD&utm_medium=Search&utm_name=Bing&utm_content=PSR1) and started following that model. That model did great on the last surge. The Alamo model predicts another 70k infected in CA by Aug 2nd. We just did 7k today. This time however, R is increasing into the curve. We're opening up and in general people are giving less of a fuck. THIS IS FUCKING IMPORANT. R is going to be going up into this surge. For the purposes of my model I did not include this increase in R at all. What this means is that ICU's will actually be filled maybe a day or two before I predict, however the aftermath is going to be severely underestimated until people revise their models for the acceleration of R. Unless we significantly change behavior in the next 4 days (we won't), we'll fill the 50% of 7435 ICU beds avail for Covid by July 12. After the next 4 days we need to dramatically increase our ICU capacity to avoid hitting cap July 12. Idk how hard this is to do I'm just a gambling addict. FWIW we have 105k hospital beds in CA. Presumably because of staffing equipment etc. there's going to be a limit to how fast those can be converted to ICU.\n\nI'm not going to show my math do ur own fucking DD, the gist of what I did was used the window of 14-22 days before today's date to calculate % of infected that need to be hospitalized by tagging to current hospitalization due to Covid (went thru CA historical data [here](https://covidtracking.com/data/state/california)). Used current ICU bed usage off of that hospitalization to make a factor going forward for what capacity is going to be needed. Assumed current week over week growth (2.0 rn) stayed constant. This is going to go up because we have an increasing R. I don't know how much it's going to increase by but the gym just opened up near me 3 days ago so u can bet ur last bear tendie that R is going to keep climbing up. This means that the old models, which we're relying on, are complete fucking trash until they account for this. From what I can tell this has not been accounted for. How the fuck are we only going to hit another 70k infected by Aug 2nd when we just did 32k in the last week and we haven't even seen the effects of the last phases of reopening\n\nThere is a misinformation war going on right now and a lot of fuks are going to tear my math apart. Do it. For those of you capable of doing ur own calculations (it's not hard), do it.\n\n[Some positions](https://imgur.com/gallery/kYHFiad?s=sms) , if we crash IMO an attack vector is going to be shorting commodities since fed's backstopping bonds and doing repos, so last attack vector shorting TLT etc. etf's isn't going to be the way. Again idk if we're going to crash but those are my bets.", "created_utc": 1593070927.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hfi0uf/18_days_until_ca_icus_filled_jul_12_why_were/", "is_self": true}
