Beijing  needs the  agricultural trade because they are food dependent and need that uninterrupted. However, they are strongly opposed to a comprehensive trade reset. Beijing wants to wait-out President Trump on the more substantive issues surrounding: intellectual property rights; forced transfer of IP and manufacturing secrets; non tariff barriers including limited access to China\u2019s controlled markets; and state run company subsidies that lead to market dumping and saturation. Trump has explicitly stated that he is not interested in a partial deal.\n* **Timeline**:\n   * **Sept 3** \\- SPY closes \\~290\n   * **Sept 5**\\- SPY closes \\~297 \u2013 China attempts to stop the bleed on the trade discussions - \u201cThe talks were supposed to have resumed this month but [China\u2019s commerce ministry said](https://news.yahoo.com/us-china-resume-trade-talks-washington-october-022959228--finance.html;_ylt=AwrE19ltSHFdCRwAqAFXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTEyOWtvNGVrBGNvbG8DYmYxBHBvcwMxBHZ0aWQDQjg3MDFfMQRzZWMDc2M-) Vice Premier Liu He, Beijing\u2019s pointman on trade, agreed to October in a phone call with US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday.\u201d\n      * President Trump will not block, refute or diminish, because this Beijing sold narrative increases the U.S. stock market valuation.
