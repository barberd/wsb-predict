Got a few offers, got ghosted, picked one of the most dysfunctional of the bunch that offered to pay me more than I am worth. That could have been the end of my story, but I realized... several of these fuckers were smart enough to recognize my bullshit and NOT hire me. \n\nThat has to count for something. \n\nNow I am no skater, but I am no genius level rain man either. Middle of the road sort of retarded. \n\nI figured, if the company is competent enough to avoid hiring fuck wits like me, they must be doing some other shit right too. So I bought stock in every company I applied to that turned me down. Starting with Digital Turbine ($APPS). \n\nMy own incompetence is a tendie dowsing rod. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInvestment strategy: \n\n1.) Apply to jerbs. \n\n2.) Buy the ones who throw you out of the building.\n\n3.) Profit\n\n4.) Buy into HR software as said companies need it to handle the inevitable deluge of naruto running virgins who heard this DD on WSB.\n\n5.)  Profit twice. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLiterally cannot go tits up.", "created_utc": 1566925882, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cw7ej6/my_own_incompetence_is_a_tendie_dowsing_rod/", "is_self": true}
