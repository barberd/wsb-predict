{"id": "egm1xb", "title": "I got roughly 100% return in realized gainz this year. Hopeful for another great bull year upcoming.", "selftext": "Rough breakdown: 80% stock, 10% buying call and 10% selling call.  The 2 stocks I held were AMD (90%) and Take-Two (10%).  Both made money. The option I made money on was buying TSM call. The option I lost potential gainz (Roughly 20K if I didn\u2019t get assigned at 33.5) on was selling AMD call. I was blessed this year and will start next year with pure option, 5k at a time. Wish you all a happy new year. \n\nhttps://ibb.co/tmkXvtL", "created_utc": 1577506715, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/egm1xb/i_got_roughly_100_return_in_realized_gainz_this/", "is_self": true}
