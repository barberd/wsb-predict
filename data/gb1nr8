{"id": "gb1nr8", "title": "Tanker rates and VLCCs", "selftext": "Good day retards,\n\nFellow money loser here. Recently I've been seeing tons of retards asking to buy tanker stocks because \"fLoaTiNg StOraGE\" and \"WHERE THEY GUNNA STORE THE OIL MOFO?\"\n\nHere's my thesis.\n\n1. The main cause/reason for the spike in worldscale/freight rates today in the market is mainly due to the short term demand destruction in oil/products. Supply, however, is unable to adjust short term, causing a spike in derived demand for oil as oil producers rush to get rid of their oil as much as possible.\n2. Given time, however, supply of oil will drop. Derived demand for tankers will drop as well.\n3. The market for freight is mainly a very tight market. I.e: if there are 100 cargoes and 99 vessel positions open, freight will spike. The opposite is true; Since no owner wants to be caught dead with an idling vessel (every Owner's shop in the world out there aims for 100% time+space utilization), they will undercut each other to not be the floating vessel.\n4. Given 3, what will happen when finally all of the floating vessels discharge their oil? All the open vessel positions in the world...and no cargo to perform.\n\nGiven the above 4 points, I believe VLCC rates are in for a fall. By that extension, tanker stocks will fall. Unfortunately, I'm unable to understand if the same will happen for product tankers since the futures contracts for oil products (diesel, jet, MOGAS, etc) are not open to retail investors.\n\nData supporting: VLCCs subs have been failing, WS rates falling, WTI/Brent contango narrowing which causes the TC breakeven for floating storage to narrow.\n\nThat's my two cents. Are any charterers/traders willing to give me an opposite POV?\n\nAlso, to all the faggots reading this post. If you don't know what is Worldscale, Time Charter Earnings, vessel positions, contango, space/time utilization, idling vessel...you shouldn't be fucking touching shipping.", "created_utc": 1588272469.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gb1nr8/tanker_rates_and_vlccs/", "is_self": true}
