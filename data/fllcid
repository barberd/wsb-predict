The step was likely caused by increased testing.](https://preview.redd.it/nwu9otpbypn41.png?width=618&format=png&auto=webp&s=750e1f7fe9fe944902e69a58195dcb5ee7267e1f)\n\nPart 3: How Fucked are We? / How long will puts keep printing?\n\nMy model shows that the number of USA positive tests may peak out at over **100,000 by May** (that\u2019s more than China).  Considering that the USA is 1/4 population of China this will have significant economic effects.\n\n[https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-how-many-coronavirus-tests-per-capita-have-been-completed](https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-how-many-coronavirus-tests-per-capita-have-been-completed)\n\nThis article suggests that China is doing over 500x as much testing as the USA currently, this makes it likely that many people in the USA with the virus go undiscovered. University of Massachusetts Amherst estimated last week that less than 1/5 of current USA cases have been identified. **If this is true, multiply all my estimations by 5.**  The geezers who wrote that paper also agree with me that it will peak in May.\n\nSource:  [https://works.bepress.com/mcandrew/1/](https://works.bepress.com/mcandrew/1/)\n\nDrill Team 6 may be focused on SPY right now due to shock value in all this, but many industries will face long trickle down effects that will provide opportunities to make tendies.\n\nDiscussion/Ideas welcome in the comments\n\n**tl/dr: This shit is just the beginning**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit:\n\nI just realized I could have opened this post with \"Corona just went over 9000 and isn't even in its final form\"\n\nAlso, I actually tried multiple tweaks while making this estimation and **decided to post the one with the lowest result.** As soon as 1 week from now it may be much easier to identify how big this gets.", "created_utc": 1584664639.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fllcid/corona_virus_numbers_and_projections_in_the_usa/", "is_self": true}
