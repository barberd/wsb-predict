{"id": "g3g4ae", "title": "This Weeks News & Current Events", "selftext": "I do a write ups on news through out the week that is either market related or could influence the market. I summarize from multiple sources so if you see an error blame CNBC or WSJ. \n\n  \nThis is what happened this week.   \n \n\n04/11 - JP Morgan and other lenders are beginning to increase their mortgage borrowing requirements as they foresee a downturn in the housing market. They fear rising unemployment, sudden pay cuts, decreasing home values, in combination with social distancing guidelines will have a very negative impact and are looking to decrease their risk exposure. For the 2nd half of March, requests to delay mortgage payments increased by 1,900%. An alarming figure that even JPow might not have an answer for.\n\n04/11 - It should be a surprise to no one that the numbers are not adding up with a swift economic rebound in China. Despite posting a much improved PMI number, China's pollution data last measured on April 5th, was determined to be at its lowest point since the outbreak began in Wuhan. Chinese coal use and property sale are still well below their pre-virus numbers indicating their factories are not ramping up to full production. Mayor Bill De Blasio stated that New York schools will remain closed until next fall, although Governor Andrew Cumo said he was the only one with the power to make such a declaration. Italy has extended its lock down to May 3rd. India is extending its lock down an additional 2 weeks to the end of April, and Trump has begun to take the stance that the US economy will not reopen until it is best for public health. He is assembling a \"Opening our country\" task force to determine when the US will be able to ease restrictions due to the virus. \n\nSpain and Austria plan on allowing small non-essential businesses to reopen while the lockdown in Wuhan, China has officially ended. Although outside arrivals to china has raised concerns in Beijing and Hong Kong about spreading a second wave as they logged an additional 34 new cases, all attributed to arrivals from overseas.\n\n04/11 - Mexico over the weekend decided to play hard ball and would only make an oil cut of 100,000 barrels per day. Saudi Arabia was not happy with this and said they would only reduce their supply to 8.2 million bpd if Mexico cut their fair share too. US panicked and got on the phone with Mexico and Trump agreed that the US would cut an additional 250,000 bpd to make up for what Mexico refused to cut. OPEC agreed to cuts of 10 million bpd during May and June, then an 8 mil bpd cut from July to the end of the year, followed by a 6mil bpd cut from January 2021-2022 As of right now, it is estimated that there is a current demand loss of 20-35 million bpd while quarantines stay in affect.\n\n\\*\\*\\*UPDATE - A deal was finalized on Sunday with sources reporting that G20 countries will be cutting an additional 3.3 million barrels, in addition to the 10 million vowed by OPEC. IEA also plans to announce oil purchases on 04/13 adding to their reserve which will reduce the amount of oil on the market \\*\\*\\*\n\n04/12 - SoftBank Vision fund seems to be going through some difficulties to put it mildly. They are forecasting that 15 companies within the fund are expected to go bankrupt, while other companies they are significantly invested in such as uber, have heightened exposure to the Covid 19 pandemic. \n\nIn recent weeks, Softbank withdrew its offer to buy 3 billion dollars worth of WeWork stock due to concerns over their ability to meet various closing conditions. WeWork has now filed a lawsuit against SoftBank for withdrawing their offer. SoftBank So far has invested 14.3 Billion dollars into WeWork, their biggest investment, which by all appearances seems to be largely failing throughout the US.\n\nUber has been another strain on WeWork, since the ride sharing service has seen a 40-60% decline in rides since the pandemic began. With multiple failed IPO, upcoming bankruptcies, and 40% of their fund being exposed to transportation and logistics, SoftBanks vision fund at the least may be screwed for a while. \n\nUPDATE. On 04/13 SoftBank announced a 16.7Billion dollar write down on the value of the vision fund. This write down reflects a loss of 9.9 Billion dollars of value in the quarter ending in March, wiping out their cumulative gains of 9.5 Billion through December\n\n04/12 - Democrats and Republicans are getting ready to provide more relief to Americans through the CARES act. The Cares act initially provided 2 trillion dollars worth of relief to individuals and businesses but now Democrat and Republican leaders are saying it's not enough. New additions to the current CARES act could add more than 1 trillion in additional relief. The funding would mostly be targeted to small businesses, unemployment aid, and possibly a 2nd round of stimulus check to each household. Banks which began taking applications for small business loans last week, were quickly stretched to their limit. BofA took in over 177,000 applications requesting a total of 36.2 Billion in financing. While Wells Fargo quickly reached their cap of 10 billion they planned on giving out in small business loans. Confusion remained among small business owners about what exactly the criteria was for receiving this money, and many found themselves ineligible to file with their bank due to current guidelines. As of Wednesday the Small Business Association said it has received over 381,000 applications for small business loans totaling over $100 Billion dollars. President Trump also made statements that no additional funding would be provided for the US post office and that he would not sign off on any bill that attempted to do so. The US post office has requested 75 billion to help them maintain operations. Some fear without some sort of stimulus for the post office, they will not be able to operate through the summer in current economic conditions. \n\n04/13 - Soon, money might not even matter when we\u2019re unable to actually eat. Globally, food processing plants have seen up to a third of their workers walk off the job, or not show up at all as they fear for their safety due to Covid 19. The closing of global economies has presented unique challenges for various parts of the food industry. While demand has dropped drastically from the restaurant sector, there's been a surge in orders from grocery stores for beef and pork. Add that to the lack of workers, processing plants are struggling to keep up with demand, while various plants all around the globe have shut down temporarily due to outbreaks or significantly reduce demand within their specific sector. Smith Field food, the world largest pork processor has shut down one of their pork processing plants which accounts for 4-5% of the US production. JBUS in Colorado announced they will be shutting down their beef plant temporarily which accounts for 5% of US supply. Additional closures in the industry are anticipated. \n\nDairy has also been hit hard, as they see their demand plummet. The issue has become so bad that dairy processing plants are dumping out the milk due to oversupply. Farmers claim the issue is that cows simply can\u2019t stop producing milk on demand. So dairy supply is likely to continue outpacing demand.\n\nGlobally crop workers have stopped showing up to work, or are not being allowed to travel to work, which is leading to rotting crops. The fruit that is salvageable has nowhere to go due to a lack of shipping containers, and competitive demand for air cargo space. The lack of workers also causes concerns that we\u2019re missing our short window to plant fruit and vegetables for future harvest. \n\nTo add insult to injury, sudden layoffs and furloughs have created an unprecedented influx of mouths to feed for food banks in the US and Europe. Some food banks have reported running out of food within just hours. A problem that many think will only get worse the longer world economies remain under lockdown. \n\n 04/13 GE has made a move to replace all their short term debt with long term debt that will push the due date to 2024. The move is said to be debt neutral and will not add onto the total amount of debt that GE owes. Currently GE has $35 billion in bonds due between now and 2024. \n\n04/13 A chapter 11 bankruptcy is looking more and more likely for AMC movie theaters. On Monday 04/13 they were downgraded from neutral to sell out of fears they are running out of liquidity options and won't be able to rebound or even open after the quarantine. AMC has started taking drastic measures to keep it's doors open though the shut downs. All 600 of AMC corporate employees have been furloughed, and they have told their landlords that they will not be paying rent for the month of April. Their rent is currently 250 million per quarter. \n\n04/13 Governors of democratic states are taking lockdown easement measures into their own hands. California and Oregon have joined New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts in saying they will rely on health & economic officials to determine when to reopen their economy. This caused backlash from president Trump who tweeted out that it is ultimately the Federal government who holds the power to determine when states could begin to reopen. There has been no official date discussed on when the economy may reopen, but some governors believe that the lockdowns could extend beyond May 1st. Overall it seems to be the stance of the Democrats that everyone must be healthy before we worry about the health of the economy. Republicans have pushed for reopening the economy sooner than later while practicing social distancing fearing the longer we remain quarantined, the less likely a quick economic recovery becomes. \n\n04/14 - To kick off earnings season Wells Fargo reported revenue of 17.78billion, which was lower than the expected 19.35 Billion. WFC posted an earnings .01cents per share, which is down from an earnings of .93 cents per share from their previous quarter. Their net income also dropped a staggering 89% to $653 million for this quarter. \n\nJPMorgan reported revenue of 28.3 Billion, which was lower than the estimated 29 Billion. They also posted an earnings per share of .78 cents, well below the 1.84 estimates. \n\nBoth banks reportedly added billions to their reserves in anticipation for a high level of credit defaults from their customers and businesses. \n\n$GE, $DIS, $XOM and $WBA have all made moves in regards to securing and rolling over their credit, as fear grows that they\u2019ll run out of credit to maintain their operations. XOM issued 9.5 Billion in debt, while DIS extended their credit line by 5billion dollars. \n\nCompanies such as $F, $M, $DAL, and $GPS, have seen their Corporate bonds ratings drop to Junk bond status. Although the Fed has announced that they will be making purchases within the junk bond market. \n\nSome estimates are predicting that the airline industry could take a 300billion dollar hit this year. \n\nVaccine manufacturers are under pressure to create vaccines faster than ever before, due to the belief that the economy can\u2019t truly return back to normal until we have a vaccine. For every day the economy is shut down, it is estimated the US loses 25Billion dollars.\n\nWeWork will not be paying their Manhattan rent for this month, joining a growing list of companies who told their landlords they will not be paying rent**.** WeWork is currently the largest tenant in Manhattan paying $500 million dollars a year in rent**.** The Cheesecake factory, and AMC are other notable names who have also told landlords they will not paying rent. \n\nThis has all been seen as fantastic news to investors, and reason to be bullish. Markets have now regained about 50% of their losses from March after having their best week in decades last week, the NASDAQ is on its longest winning streak since December, and the S&P500 is trading at 35x earnings. $TSLA is back above $700, and most tech stocks are racing towards their ATHs. \n\n04/16 - The IEA, which is seen as a more neutral player in the oil industry in comparison to OPEC that provides accurate information, found that Oil demand was down by 29M BPD for the month of April. They estimate overall, oil demand will fall by approximately 9.3M BPD for the year of 2020. Under the current OPEC deal, OPEC countries will cut approx 9M bpd starting May until June, then 8M BDP for the rest of the year after that. Globally oil reserves are starting to fill up due to excess demand, and the US is forecasting their oil reserves will be full by summer. Trump is considering paying US Shale companies to cut back on production to prevent this from happening. \n\nAs of 04/16 unemployment claims have increased to 23 million, as 5M more americans filed for unemployment benefits the previous week. Economists predicted that the US would have an unemployment rate of 12% by the end of the month, while some payroll indicators predict that we may already be at 16% unemployment midway through April. \n\nThe Small Business Association has run out of 350Billion in funds approved by congress to loan to small businesses affected by the Corona Virus. The reported figures vary, but somewhere between 1.6 - 1.9M applications have been approved for loans, while over 3M applications have been submitted. The SBA says they can approve no more additional applications until congress secures more funding for the PPP (payroll protection program). Congress is in talks to add an additional 250B in funding for the program. Democrats refuse to support the current bill, and are requesting billions more in funding be added for hospitals and local governments. \n\n**\\*\\*UPDATE\\*\\*** 23% of the SBA loans went to California, New York, and Texas receiving a total of 81billion in loans. Retail, food and accomodation accounted for less than 9% of the approved loans despite being the industries hit hardest by the Corona virus. Construction firms received 13% of all loans,. \n\nAfter markets closed on Thursday, Gilead $GILD announced positive results from their clinical drug trials being conducted at The University of Chicago Hospital. Their antiviral drug Remdesivir was identified as one of few that may be effective at combating Covid-19. Out of 125 patients enrolled, 113 were classified as severe covid cases. Out of the 125 only 2 died during the trial, and \u201ca majority of the patients enrolled in the trial have already been discharged from the hospital\u201d although the exact number of patients discharged was not given. It is noteworthy that there was no placebo group included with this study. Also this drug will only work for patients already infected with covid-19 and does not act as a vaccine. \n\nThe white house has released a list of guidelines for states to follow when reopening their counties. Withdrawing from his previous stance, Trump has now said he\u2019ll leave it up to the governors to decide when their state/counties have satisfied the requirements for reopening. The guidelines suggest that \u201cRegions see a decline in documented cases over a 14 day period, ensure hospitals can treat all patients without crisis care, have a robust testing program in place and antibody testing for at risk healthcare workers.\u201d The guidelines are to be followed in 3 different phases with each phase allowing more sectors of the economy to open up while still following social distancing measures. It is still believed by many physicians and economists that the social distancing measures will have to stay in place until an actual vaccine is developed. \n\nBoeing $BA also announced after the markets closed that they will be resuming production of their commercial airplanes. The announcement by $BA in combination with $GILD clinical trials and reopening guidelines sent futures higher heading into Friday. At the time of writing this the Dow Jones is up 860 points in the futures market.   \n\n04/17 - Apple $AAPL received a downgrade this morning from Goldman Sachs from *neutral* to *sell* over concerns that iPhones sales would slump due to Corvid 19. $AMZN, $NFLX are also down by greater than 2% which seems to be weighing down on the rally everyone had hoped for, although the day is still green overall. $MRNA is up over 15% over hopes of a vaccine and federal funding, $BA is up by 13% due to revamping production of their commercial planes, and $TSLA continues to inch higher towards $800. As of midday, $TSLA is trading at $756.\n\n04/17 - The race to create a vaccine for Covid 19 is still in full effect as Moderna $MRNA is set to receive $483 Million from the federal government to accelerate the development of a vaccine. Phase one for the vaccine is already underway with patients being vaccinated in March. The additional money from the government will go towards supporting Phase 2 & 3 of development. \n\nIn the UK a million doses of a potential vaccine are already being developed, though the vaccine is still being tested in trials and has not been approved. It is estimated that production of the vaccine will be ready by September. The company developing the vaccine is putting itself at great financial risk by starting early production, because if the vaccine proves to be ineffective or is not approved then it can not be distributed to the public population. No official number was given, only that production costs tens of millions of dollars. There are currently over 70 vaccines under development with at least 5 of those already in the human trial phase.", "created_utc": 1587177974.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g3g4ae/this_weeks_news_current_events/", "is_self": true}
