I am... idea- Shorting brokerage firms CBRE or MMI", "selftext": "If anyone is familiar with what happened in June to the NYC commercial real estate market, they know there\u2019s been major panic and major drops in pricing / much lower transactions.. funds and investors are simply sitting on the side line as the new rent laws completely diminished all future upside / value - add to rent stabilized properties, which is the majority of the housing market in the 5 boroughs. \n\nI just checked and major brokerage firms such as CBRE and MMI have yet to announce Q3 results.. I personally am very familiar with NYC brokerage and there has never been such panic / drop in transactions since the recession. \n\nHowever, I have no knowledge of investing in the stock market. Those brokerage firms I mentioned are nationwide however NYC is a beast of its own and even if there are 5 major city markets for the firms, just having 1, especially NYC, take such a huge fall, should of course impact their stock pricing... yet it clearly hasn\u2019t since June...\n\nFurthermore, I believe, although I\u2019m not sure, it\u2019s always about investing against the grain... well in this case, go take a walk down NYC and ask anyone if their families with commercial real estate and where it stands.. I\u2019m talking 40% drops in values on rent stabilized buildings.. let alone buyers completely have dried up as they are waiting for cheaper and cheaper prices... (I\u2019m not talking about the residential sales market which is all you hear about in the news)... \n\nThoughts? Especially from someone very familiar with NYC brokerage as I am?", "created_utc": 1572746542, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dqu8a6/anyone_familiar_with_nyc_commercial_real_estate_i/", "is_self": true}
