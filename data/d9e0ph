{"id": "d9e0ph", "title": "Short ATVI!", "selftext": "Looks like Activision is already back to their scummy practices again and trying to squeeze their latest title that isn\u2019t even out yet - Modern Warfare. Certain game modes have been locked behind a exclusivity wall that is only available to players on the PS4. This is causing a HUGE uproar in the playerbase already and people are cancelling preorders en mass.\n\nAlso, loot boxes are confirmed in the game! Expect players to go into an angered frenzy when the game is released and ends up being pay-to-win like black ops. \n\nWe can also expect Activision to also start squeezing players in WoW Classic. Perfect time to load up on puts. This stock is gonna plummet back to low 40s or even 30s!\n\nTL;DR - A lot of people thought Activision was changing grit habits but it looks like they already relapsed to scumbag ethics.", "created_utc": 1569468089, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d9e0ph/short_atvi/", "is_self": true}
