{"id": "ci55fj", "title": "WMB - Williams Companies NESE pipeline", "selftext": "Has anyone else been following the NESE pipeline saga in NY/NJ area? Basically Williams Companies has been pushing to build the NESE pipeline (24 miles of NG pipeline to feed MH, Queens, Long Island areas). The pipeline would be located in both NJ and NY and the proposal is being pummeled by environmental groups. The permit in each state has been rejected and the DEP has also rejected the proposal over the past few months. Both governors are fairly progressive and also trying to build their following within their party. This year is an election year for some of Cuomo's buddies so the thinking is that this will be held up indefinitely until possibly after the 2020 elections. \n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/national-grid-isnt-providing-new-gas-hookups-in-new-york-11564003583](https://www.wsj.com/articles/national-grid-isnt-providing-new-gas-hookups-in-new-york-11564003583)\n\nI work around the construction industry and have heard many stories of projects being fully re-designed to eliminate the need for natural gas. This is affecting projects all through LI and Manhattan but will come into play in a major way at the 2 airports - JFK/LGA and their upcoming developments. From what I have heard from people close to the situation is that there will be no approval for a long time if ever. National Grid has advised no new gas accounts unless the pipeline is approved. There will be immense pressure on the states to approve, but I also get the feeling that Cuomo will dig his heels in to keep his status in the progressive/green new deal world.\n\nOn top of this, in last quarters earnings release, WMB stated that they expect the permit to be approved and for the construction to start in fall 2019. They also raised their net income and earnings guidance on that call and specifically called out their Northeast region as the fast growing portion of the company. \n\nTheir shares have been dropping this week but the next earnings release is on 7/31 after hours and I have a feeling a major outlook revision may be brought up. I typically stay away from NG companies due to not having too much knowledge about the sector but figured this one could be a fun one to ride Puts on through earnings to see what occurs. There is news out every couple days on the pipeline which could get interesting given the implications.", "created_utc": 1564158983, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ci55fj/wmb_williams_companies_nese_pipeline/", "is_self": true}
