Just want to get thoughts on them as a loose predictor of market direction.\n\nI've got the [1 year QQQ chart open](https://imgur.com/a/IO3jm5i). RSI at 78, OBV -81, and todays move puts us above the upper Bollinger band. Looking back on the chart we make this kind of move outside the upper or lower band fairly infrequently and the most this year was 3-4 sessions straight (december plunge) before correcting. Bollinger and RSI indicate market is currently \"expensive\" and \"overbought.\" OBV is at levels we've not seen since early October. I know high OBV normally proceeds larger directional moves but we've already had quite the move from the 169 low just 2 weeks ago...really not sure how to interpret it.\n\nGiven the info the chart gives us is it fair to believe we get some consolidation or pullback somewhere in the next \\~5 sessions?\n\nInterested to hear your thoughts.", "created_utc": 1553220979, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b3ze8o/posted_this_in_the_daily_but_got_buried_pretty/", "is_self": true}
