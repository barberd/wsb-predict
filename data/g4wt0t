{"id": "g4wt0t", "title": "SnapChat Institutional Options Play", "selftext": "Hey ya'll, I've mentioned this play a couple times in comments already but I thought I would post it for more visibility. This shit got blocked by automod like 5 times so I'm positing it as discussion instead of DD.\n\nTL,DR; SNAP 4/24C 13.5\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** As always, this is not a 100% bet, but a number of factors that lead me to believe that SNAP has a high *probability* of a gap up after earnings. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What is Unusual Options Activity:**\n\nUnusual options activity is fairly self explanatory, a flow of options that seem to be out of the ordinary. Most of the time Institutions use options as a hedge for their long or short positions, but there are a number of variables that you can use to narrow down and deduce whether or not the position was a hedge or a bet. After that, you can further deduce whether or not they were buys or sells or whether or not they were to open or to close. I can post a guide to this at a later date, but for now let's look at the trade.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Bet**\n\nOn Friday, 4/17, a MASSIVE amount of options were traded on SNAP, specifically on the 4/24 strike date. 3 8000 size blocks were traded at the exact same time, 8000 4/24 13.5C, 8000 4/24 16C, 8000 4/24 16.5C. The size of this trade represents an equity volume that is more than 10% of the volume traded that day, making this bet a very unusual one. Considering that the expiration is so close, with a lot so large, it's safe to say that this was a directional bet rather than a hedge. There was also no uptick in volume that coincided with the open. \n\nOnce we break down the bid/ask spreads, it's easy to deduce that this was a bullish debit spread, with the total debit of well over $700,000. IV is up 153% on some of these options. This means that big money is making a big bet that SNAP will kill earnings. \n\nMM's also made moves that confirms this theory. You guys are smart and can google how large option blocks affect MMs, but this buy coincided with a movement up in price in the following minutes. This is further evidence that this is a bullish trade, as MMs became short delta and bought shares to remain delta neutral and long volatility. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Fundamentals**\n\nBut all you autists are going to say: SNAP can't possibly beat earnings, revenue from ads is down bigly!\n\nI agree. Revenue is down bigly, but the one thing you fools always fuck up on is that IT'S EXPECTED. Earnings are not about results, it's about expectations and guidance. Everybody and their mother expects SNAP to have shitty earnings judging by sentiment here and on Twitter. If you want to make money, be contrarian. \n\nWhy am I on the other side of this bet? User growth; historically these tech stocks don't give a fuck about revenue during earnings. It will ignore revenue like SPY ignores bad news, because USER GROWTH is the name of the game. [SNAP said a few weeks ago the ads it does have have far more engagement, 36% more installations and 19% more swipe ups (which directly correlates to ad revenue). Not only that, video calls are up 50% and people are spending 25% more time on lenses.](https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/snapchat-sees-higher-usage-amid-covid-19-lockdowns-outlines-key-trends-of/575333/) These factors lead me to believe SNAP is going to experience a huge gap up after earnings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusions:**\n\nUnusual options activity is common and a lot of it is noise, but there are certain cases like GILD, BA, and this SNAP play that sometimes can be a tool to follow the trades of people MUCH smarter and with MUCH deeper pockets than us. These compounding number of factors make me bullish this earnings season for SNAP, but take this information and deduce draw your own conclusions from it.", "created_utc": 1587402679.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g4wt0t/snapchat_institutional_options_play/", "is_self": true}
