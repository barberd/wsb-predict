First Gilead, then Moderna, then Novavax, and Sorrento. Feels like past 2 weeks have had no news related to a vaccine. I don\u2019t expect a vaccine anytime soon but I do find it weird that there hasn\u2019t been any vaccine related news to give the market a nice bump. Any chance Donnie and JPow are saving some positive news for a red run to give the market an artificial bump?", "created_utc": 1591317682.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gwu5x8/anyone_think_its_weird_theres_been_no_vaccine/", "is_self": true}
