It literally can\u2019t go tits up.\n\nTLRY looks like the classic bubble chart, and we haven't had full capitulation yet.\n\nWith all of the short interest, I would expect any sort of bounce with volume to potentially rocket back upwards as shorts get squeezed and take profit. That being said, if you bought at any time in the last 6 months you are underwater. At some point we will reach a breaking point.  \n\nThe insider selling has also picked up recently, and if it does start to really head down, could add more fuel to the fire.\n\nI've got a 5/17 $60c/$50p strangle, hoping for some volatility/continued drop in the near term.
