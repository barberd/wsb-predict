Like seriously, what the fuck is wrong with you. \n\nI seriously hate reading about retards complaining that RH didn't do something right when you bought some short calls or short puts. YOU AREN'T USING A PROFESSIONAL BROKER. STOP.\n\nRH is good for dipping your feet in the water, really just buying naked options. Stop fucking doing more advanced shit on RH and get a real broker, like some of you are actually retarded...\n\nFFS think or swim literally accepts anybody, and they have live updates. There is IBKR, charles schawb, tastyworks, the list goes on sorry if I can't name all the brokers.\n\njust stop using robinhood if you are being serious about making money...", "created_utc": 1576939359, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/edqnbc/can_we_have_a_serious_discussion_about_people/", "is_self": true}
