{"id": "g36dam", "title": "Inflation is here to come and MMT is BS", "selftext": "Today I\u00b4ll tell you the story how Keynes outed himself as Gay, Alan Greenspan spilled some tea and why the monetary system is set up to fail !\n\n***TLDR: Puts on Monetary System, Puts on Keynes, Calls on anything that is not distributed by a government***\n\n# 1 ) How it should play out normally:\n\nIn fact we are seeing a **deflationary** shock right now. This is due to the **drop in demand**.\n\nA  good example for this are potato farmers. They produce potatos on mass  for McDonalds, BurgerKing.. you name it. These companies do not buy any  potatos right now. So the farmer has ***less demand*** but a ***big supply.*** Therefore he will **lower the prices** to get rid of his potatos and get money to fullfil his liabilities (=farmer wants to stay liquid).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe  \"real\" problem will actually occur when everything looks like recovery.  You wonder why. Printer went brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr and everything is alright. NO?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell,  let\u00b4s assume Corona is over (HAHAHAH GOOD JOKE), everything cool again and the \"normal\"  life is being started. What will happen? Everyone will spend their freshly printed Powell-Bux ($) on to all sorts of consumer products. So  we suddendly get a **high demand** for **low supply**.  But why low supply? Hmmm, because at this point the majority of the  western world is/was sitting on their ass in their homes and isn\u00b4t producing  shit for months. If you look into Economics 101, high demand on low supply means  higher prices. And as the real economy is literally being flooded with  money at this point we will see quite a huge rise in prices, which will  not go down that fast.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNaturally if you have a free market **anything** tends to deflate eventually \\[1\\] because the more efficent something gets the cheaper the cost of production.\n\n\\-\n\n# 2) Our friends from the FED\n\nAt this point people start getting out their cum-covered pictures of Jpow, Bernanke and Alan Greenspan. And they say \"Fuck you we  haven\u00b4t seen big inflation after 2008 too blablabalbal\"\n\nLet me quote our favorite mf G, Mr.Greenspan:\n\n\"We don\u00b4t have a system that is working. **We have one that moves cash around**.  We can guarantee cash benefits as far out and at whatever size you like but we **can\u00b4t guarantee purchasing power**.\n\nOh you have bad debt. We now own that debt - we just bought it off. Don\u00b4t ask where the money came from, the intern just made up some numbers in the computer.  Don\u00b4t worry.  It is completly logical and seems totally legit from economic perspective.\n\n**SIKE**\n\nThe whole system has to go bust and states, companies etc. need to get rid of their debt and they can only do that with **INFLATION** if the FED continues like that then we will go **JAPANO MODE** real fast\n\n\\-\n\n# 3) Conclusion\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is how it should play out. We will see further deflation, and the boom inflation. Or we go full Japan and get us some nice Stagflation - but that is a post for another day.\n\nYes I am telling you **Keynesian economics are bullshit**. They might work short-term because a government/central bank can keep the market afloat by BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR but not the economy and those are 2 very different things my friends\n\n.\n\nSmall imagery for you:\n\nIf the economy is a car and Keynesian Economics are an ABS. If you start to lose control (economy downie) ABS might help you to regain control(economy uppie). But if you drive down a fucking cliff (economic shock) - f\\*ck your ABS, won\u00b4t save you.\n\nI know shitty analogy but I needed to get this off my brain after trying to put something together for 10 minutes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Yeah I know, some points might be incomplete thats why I invite you to oppose my opinion and convince me otherwise.***\n\n# 4) Extra sources for you\n\nIf you are really interested in understanding why this was inevitable, Corona or not - I suggest you check out the following links to get into the whole thing:\n\n\\[1\\] - \"The Fed\\`s losing battle with deflation\":\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8lfLqnhuGs&t=25s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8lfLqnhuGs&t=25s)\n\nNote: 45 minutes - that will actually make you more clever.\n\n\\[2\\]- Hidden Secrets of Money by Mike Maloney\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyV0OfU3-FU&list=PLK8aHk5TqClBale3rjOeeQ1wdxZgtiJCA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyV0OfU3-FU&list=PLK8aHk5TqClBale3rjOeeQ1wdxZgtiJCA)\n\nNote: He is actually quite a doomer (I mean he wants you to buy gold FROM him) regarding economic systems but the theoretical foundation and research **EDIT: ... are solid**\n\n\\[3\\] - George Gammon\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJ635FXRWek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJ635FXRWek)\n\nNote: Funny guy, who explains very complex theories VERY well\n\n\\[4\\] - 90 Year cycles of the world\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEnuWv38urI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEnuWv38urI)\n\n\\-\n\n**EDIT:**\n\n\\[5\\]: Thanks to [akatheaja](https://www.reddit.com/user/akatheaja/) for this IMPORTANT piece of information\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0nERTFo-Sk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0nERTFo-Sk)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut these are still all just **possibilities -** mabye I am completly wrong and they turn the already not so \"free\" market into full socialism, no debt defaults comrade.\n\nExpect the worst, hope for the best.
