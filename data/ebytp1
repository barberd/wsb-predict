Semi DD?", "selftext": "In LUV's Oct 24 2019 Q3 ER they stated the following.\n\n\nRevenue 5.6B\n\nThat they estimate the Boeing MAX grounding cost them $435m for the nine months ended september 30 2019.\n\nIn it they say they expect Boeing  to get approval to return flying the MAX in fourth quarter 2019 and that they expect it will take ~2 months after that to get approval from the FAA.  As such it was removed from their flight schedule until February 8 2020.\n\nCurrently they have 34 grounded MAX, and were expecting 41 this year that look like they will be pushed into 2020.\n\nDue to the above, they have delayed retirement of seven 737-700 aircraft they had planned for Q4 2019, and they expect to retire 10 more during fourth quarter 2019.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------\nOthers sources/info\n------------------------------------------------\n\nSW's oldest 737-700 are from 1997 with a purchase of 63 in total.\n\n\n\nSW today says they have doubled their canceled flights -removing roughly 300 weekday flights of their peak day schedule  daily flights of 4000 through April 13th\n\n\nOne major consideration of airlines is fuel cost.  The 737-700  has a fuel efficiency per seat of 87 mpg.  While the grounded MAX have a fuel efficiency per seat  of  ~121 mpg.  That is a 39% difference.  \n\n\nMy adhd has kicked in and I forgot where I was going with this.", "created_utc": 1576603694, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ebytp1/is_now_the_time_to_short_luvsouth_west_semi_dd/", "is_self": true}
