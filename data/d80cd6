I\u2019ve looked into custodial accounts but I think only the kids can parents can open / manage that for her which is annoying cause they\u2019re both really dumb. I was also looking into a UGMA account which seems like the way to go because I\u2019ll be unable to trade derivatives. \n\nBut I don\u2019t want to keep the stock in any of my personal accounts because I have a severe gambling addiction and it will be gone before she can spell. Any ideas? \n\nTLDR; wan buy baby AMD buh how?", "created_utc": 1569205602, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d80cd6/buying_stocks_for_an_infant/", "is_self": true}
