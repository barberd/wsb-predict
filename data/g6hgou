Your American Tankers are worthless.\n\nJ Pow and the money printer - The US economy is the only one actually operating right now and every other central bank/Real Investor is holding cash making the dollar appreciate OFC he can print more. They could actually print more if they wanted to the world has a Dollar shortage.\n\nSnapchat - Looking at EPS on a tech stock means NOTHING. Yes they burn money that is their plan and guess what money is cheap right now because the fed is printing it. Their glasses are still stupid though.\n\nEDIT:\n\nNetflix - They got an increase in subscriptions but their revenue stayed the same. That's because they would report it for the next quarter like any standard accountant would.\n\nCome on guys be better. Do Better.\nhttps://imgur.com/a/yTOuHFC", "created_utc": 1587622205.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6hgou/you_guys_used_to_be_smarter/", "is_self": true}
