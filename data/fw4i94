While stocks may appear to be moving in an upward trend, reading between the headlines paints a picture too bleak for most people to consider. Virus numbers are counted incompetently at best, and fraudulently at worst. Our country\u2019s historical corporate juggernauts are burdened by unimaginable debt (thank you for pointing this out, Fuzzy), and our economy was shut down so fast, some business owners still think they will be opening up again in a few weeks.\n\nThis pandemic is a mess. Long before Bill Gates gave his infamous 2015 Ted Talk, George Bush read a book about the 1918 Spanish Flu during his presidency. It terrified him, and he used his influence to create a plan for when the next pandemic would strike. He invested billions into the project, and even did \u201cgerm games.\u201d Well, after H1N1 happened with a .2% death rate, the supplies failed to be replaced (thanks Obama) and the project was put on the back burner by both of the following presidents. As a result, we have found ourselves made into scared little bitches holed up in our houses, too scared to even go on a walk. The \u201ctests\u201d we are using today are inaccurate up to 50% of the time. When Dr. Scarf tells you that only 90% of all tests are positive, she is failing to mention that false negatives are a real problem. Now maybe this wouldn\u2019t be such a big deal, but these shitty tests are also being used around the world. And there aren\u2019t even enough of the tests to actually monitor the whole disease. It would actually be more accurate to think about the tests as a sample size of a study (positive rates / total tests) than an actual representation of how many people are infected in our country.\n\nThis brings me to the number of deaths. Did you know that France only counts a Covid-19 death if it happens in a hospital? In our own glorious country, if someone dies from a respiratory failure but failed to get tested first, they are counted as a death due to respiratory failure and not Covid-19. Now, if tests were abundant and universally produced 15 minute results, this would not be a problem. But as you may have already deduced, this is a major problem. You see, it is reasonable to conclude that while the total cases and deaths appear to be going down in all of our official records, the REAL number of cases and deaths is still increasing exponentially.\n\nIn a question: What if the datasets we have are only capable of growing linearly, while the virus is growing exponentially?\n\nYou may ask yourself, \u201cSo what if the world is fukkkk? These companies have crazy amounts of money and can get more thanks to unlimited liquidity. Recession is cancelled LOL.\u201d This is fine and all, but have you happened to read Fuzzy\u2019s posts on corporate bonds? To summarize his absolute brilliance, a lot of companies that you never think about have been issuing bonds to pay their debts. When bonds come due, they just issue more bonds to pay for it. Fast forward a decade, and you have companies like Ford, where they made just 50 million in net revenue but also just got downgraded in their lending score to junk bonds. I\u2019m not nearly smart enough to put all the pieces together, but their massive debt load with brand new higher interest rates is about to sodomize their measly remaining profits. And this is just the beginning. Less business from people staying home means more bonds and less equity. I don\u2019t have nearly enough to time to look at every company\u2019s credit agreement, but the ones I have looked at seem really sketchy. Big numbers are coming due in the next 2-3 years, but there is a tiny amount of equity left to leverage. \n\nSmall businesses are getting bent over and shown whose really the boss. As a small business owner myself, I thought the whole 10k advance loan you don\u2019t pay back (paid within 3 days of applying), and anything else up to $2 million was a bit of a stretch. And then the PPP loan where you get a massive amount of money forgiven was also announced, and that was just too good as well. But then Mnuchin went on TV and actually said point blank that people will get funded the same day they apply, starting on April 3rd. Well, you can bet your sweet gay ass they fucked this up. Not only did NOBODY get funded (search \u201cSBA\u201d on twitter and it will remind you of searching \"just laid off\") but the banks straight up rebelled. BoA didn\u2019t open applications until halfway through the day, Wells Fargo flipped the bird and said they were only going up to $10 billion in loans (and they had already hit that number), and my own personal bank didn\u2019t even let me apply until this morning. Furthermore, a LOT of people have called SBA, and they are now saying the 10k grant will be based on your number of employees, and your money won\u2019t get there for another 2-3 WEEKS. Oh yeah. This is going exactly according to plan.\n\nSo sure, the stocks are trending up right now while the retarded bulls circle jerk each other and fantasize about the \u201cV shaped recovery.\u201d Meanwhile, anyone with a warped gay mind can see the news is fake, the numbers are fake, and the real crash is imminent.\n\nSPY 6/19 220p", "created_utc": 1586199118.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fw4i94/stocks_only_go_one_direction_mr_hydes_side_of_the/", "is_self": true}
