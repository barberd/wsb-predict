It's really easy - even your wife's boyfriend could do it!\n\n1. BUY a put/call.\n2. Wait for a decent profit to show.\n3. SELL a put/call, at the same expiration, but a strike that is different while as **close** to the bought option as possible. This works best with options that are $1 apart. **Example**: Buy SPY 250p, wait for profit, sell SPY 251p.  \nThis will create what's called a 'vertical spread' - the buy/sell will balance each other out, locking in your profits no matter where the ticker goes from that point forward.\n4. Wait till next day. Greeks might affect your P/L a bit negatively or positively, but your P/L will still be roughly the same. Sell the whole spread and enjoy feeling smarter than the system.\n\nYou can also use this to 'exit' an option that has gone bad in the same day, to 'lock in' losses in the same manner so that you can't accrue more losses that day.\n\n**DISCLAIMER**: I am not an expert trader. I'm still quite new, but learned about this recently and have used it a few times with success. Fuck around with this in paper first to get a feel for it and explore any doubts you might have, or jump right in at your own risk. I also accept criticism but can't promise I'll give a fuck what you think.\n\nGood luck, autists.", "created_utc": 1586715015.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g01mwl/wall_street_hates_him_learn_how_this_autist_gets/", "is_self": true}
