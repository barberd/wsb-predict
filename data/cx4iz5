{"id": "cx4iz5", "title": "BILI Stock is a value stock with good valuations", "selftext": "BILI stock despite beating earnings experiences a dip due to forecasted expenses for the coming quarters.  Much of this is due to diversification into other industries - mobile, live broadcasting, online advertising, e-commerce, etc. Revenue will depreciate as a result but makes sense as this company is still in it's investment phases. \n\nOne of the big factor that drives me to be bullish is the user growth. More specifically ACTIVE user growth has increased 30% in the recent quarter, driving the total active user base to 110M members. On paper, these are extremely tell-tale numbers. 80% of active users are mobile based, which will grow as the mobile industry grows along + improved graphics etc. Correlation is a key things. Ran the numbers for BILI along with tech sector/graphics (AMD, NVIDIA, etc), correlation is 0.45-0.56. Those are pretty decent numbers indicating growth in these sectors result in BILI growth to some extent. Standard dev. is 4%! pretty good predictor. \n\nMore on the numbers. Trade war price should be settled in across the board and tariff increases will have little impact on the products of this company. I believe revenue resumes pretty high, actually 450% surprise on Mobile revenue and overall 50% surprise on revenue. \n\nTDLR: BILI spent a lot of money, will continue to do so for the year, but revenue should grow due to huge increases in Active Users! \n\nPT: $20 before EOY.", "created_utc": 1567102010, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cx4iz5/bili_stock_is_a_value_stock_with_good_valuations/", "is_self": true}
