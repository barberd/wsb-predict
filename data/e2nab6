This was a tactical play so he can buy low and sell high in his words \u201cstonks only go up\u201d and then release the flying version called Tesla Dragon, it\u2019s literally a collaboration between spacex and Tesla creating the first flying car and that\u2019s not all, the boring company will get in on this shit show by sectioning off and buying the air in the sky where only Tesla vehicles can fly. everyone is going to get this new update that allows the Tesla battery to propel the vehicles into the air all this coming later into December. \nDon\u2019t miss out on the trade of a lifetime.", "created_utc": 1574890657, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e2nab6/tsla_890_december_2019/", "is_self": true}
