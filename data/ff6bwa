This is reasonable for lots of companies, particularly testing like Quest and pharmaceutical companies involved in speculation around possible treatments or vaccines for the beer virus. These stocks will almost certainly go up even in the face of a downward market trend. But when you look at the larger healthcare landscape there are a lot of risk factors which are absolutely not priced in to stocks right now. I work in healthcare as a provider and clinical director, and I decided to write this after a meeting Friday where our leadership discussed the situation for us and for other healthcare companies.\n\nOur agency provides education to other healthcare providers across the country and we brought in an infection disease specialist this week to discuss the beer virus on a national webinar. We do a lot of these and they're routinely attended by 20 to 100 people. This one was attended by 1,200 people. We did some education on symptoms, testing, negative air pressure rooms, personal protective equipment (PPE) and more but we got questions which were utterly terrifying from providers across the nation. \"Where do I get a mask?\" was the most common question. *From medical providers and healthcare leaders.* This is not the question they should be asking. The healthcare system is woefully under prepared for this.\n\nLet me add another perspective; infection control across the country is terrible. There are numerous agencies that accredit healthcare agencies like hospital and primary care offices. One of the most common citations across the country is for failures in infection control. Researchers [routinely find failures to control for infection in healthcare settings.](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2683488) Misued PPE  is basically useless and providers routinely fit it incorrectly. This is why you're more likely to get an infection in a hospital than anywhere else and an inpatient hospital admission increases your risk of death *separate* from whatever brought you in there. Now add a disease that transmits easily to the mix and imagine what happens.\n\nThere's a lot of talk about supply and demand problems in the market at large; no cheap stuff coming out of China creates a supply problem while quarantines and fear can reduce the demand. But healthcare isn't immune to this either. In the event of a high rate of infection, providers will get sick as well while demand rises because more sick people need care and testing. No doctors because of 2 week quarantines or actual illness will create a supply problem (high demand/low supply). Alternatively, people with normal illnesses will not want to go into a building likely to be housing people with COVID-19 which will decrease the number of visits in our fee for service healthcare economy (adequate supply/low demand).\n\nThis is why I'm picking UNH to bet against. Not just because they may spend boat loads of money hospitalizing members with the beer virus, but also because Optum Health, their research and quality arm has bought up outpatient clinics all over the country employing more than 50,000 providers nationwide (you can find this in their most recent [10-K SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/731766/000073176620000006/unh2019123110-k.htm#sAF986A365FD253DFB7944631F39EA780)). This part of their portfolio is in for a big hit with the coming problems caused by COVID-19 and it doesn't matter whether it's only driven by fear or actual infections and deaths.\n\nAdditionally, as the nation's largest health insurer they're in for some systemic risks tied to the economy at large. While insurance companies will feel the impact of a recession later than other parts of the economy, layoffs translate directly to lost revenue. No employees, no employee health benefits. Reduced revenue from both insurance premiums and their Optum division coupled with increased costs for the members they maintain is a recipe for disaster. \n\nYou may wish to consider a longer expiration date but this is a medium term investment in an option that isn't likely to end up ITM but has a high probability to rise. While all UNH options are expensive at the moment the Puts have been falling a little bit given people's unreasonable assumptions about healthcare in general.", "created_utc": 1583636188, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ff6bwa/healthcare_risks_amidst_coronavirus/", "is_self": true}
