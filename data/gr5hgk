{"id": "gr5hgk", "title": "The Immediate Bull Case for Pager Duty $PD", "selftext": "What is Pager Duty? \n\nPager Duty is an IT Operations platform for incident response that allows companies to easily set up on-call rotations and communication protocols for engineers responsible for keeping services alive or recovering them if they do fail. You can think PagerDuty like the pavers that physicians and other practitioners wear during rotations so that they can promptly respond to issues. \n\nWhy is PD such a critical company? \n\nAs retail, education, and entertainment drastically shift online and more users rely on the Internet, strain on information systems grows. In short, there are more incidents. Pager Duty not only landed more customers during this period, but also likely saw revenue growth via its per user subscription model as more engineers have likely been added to on-call rotations. Their customers include DoorDash and Stripe, two companies benefiting heavily from the Shelter-in-place orders here in the states. \n\nThe history of the stock price?\n\nER 6/4 \n\nPager Duty is trading at $26.62, or about a $2 B valuation, or roughly half of their ATH following their IPO. They have unjustifiably continued to slide since exiting the lockup period and trade a multiple lower than other newcomers in their industry. \n\nTheir earnings report will contain more than two months of Shelter-in-Place related revenue. Meanwhile, their customers are scrambling to hire the sort of engineers that get Pager Duty accounts on the first day. Revenue will be up. \n\nPosition?\n\n$30 Call 6/19. \n\nWhat about their continued losses?\n\nThat should be considered a positive. The company is investing heavily in innovation and preparing a platform that will be resilient through a period of long-term growth.\n\nIndustry insights?\n\nPager Duty\u2019s platform offers the easiest solution to set up, and scales using a very efficient technology stack built on the Erlang Virtual Machine (based on job postings and employee skills). That\u2019s the same virtual machine that enabled WhatsApp to scale with very few engineers, and it\u2019s the same virtual machine powering Discord chat. The reliability and efficiency for concurrent connections is a margin driver long-term, even though it\u2019s hard to get started. It\u2019s that good. \n\nPager Duty\u2019s transparent pricing model and value drivers make it very appealing to people looking to call an API and keep it moving. There are no threatening legacy solutions in the space. \n\nThey also recently opened an Atlanta office, which is a hotbed for strong engineering talent from Georgia Tech. Ops and Security are Atlanta\u2019s sweet spots. \n\nCompetition?\n\nSquadCast - nobody important afaik\nVictorOps - great solution, growing, but lots of ground to gain on features, revenue, and ease-of-use. \nDIY - You could probably build something custom in-house if you have 8-10 engineers to spare, and strong knowledge of your APM infrastructure. Most companies are far too fragmented for this sort of work and would fail before running to Pager Duty, but some have built sophisticated solutions. \nTwilio - Most likely an acquisition target than a competitive player long term. They aren\u2019t built for IT Operations. \n\nCustomers?\n\nShopify, Amazon, and Zoom (see case study below):\n\nhttps://www.pagerduty.com/customer/zoom-video-communications/\n\nWhy are they down so much? Why has the market ignored them? Since web traffic has tripled, I expect incident response teams at software companies to have at least doubled. The obvious shift to cloud computing makes them more appealing, yet they can be implemented to work for on-premise environments as well. I plan to invest heavily in Pager Duty long term.
