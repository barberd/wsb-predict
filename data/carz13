{"id": "carz13", "title": "Semi long term investing, is X3 a good option?", "selftext": "Last week I finally paid off my car and zeroed out my credit card debt so I decided it is time to invest larger amounts for longer term.\n\nFor the past few years I have been playing around with the stock market, but all of it was with smaller figures (never had a portfolio above $3,000, never held a stock longer than 6 months).\n\nMy plan right is now to take X amount of every paycheck I get and simply add it to my portfolio by buying the exact same index as before. My initial plan was to pick the X3 S&amp;P and Nasdaq (SPXL and TQQQ) and just buy extra stocks every months. It sounds like it has the benefit of earning decently, while not adding thousands of dollars every months.\n\nMy main concern is that I can be seriously mistaken and that plan is actually terrible. I understand that nothing is certain, but there are risks that are unnecessary to take with long term investments, so I am trying to avoid them.\n\nWhen I say long term, I am talking about probably no more than 5 years. I will probably leave some of the money after I take it out, but the main purpose for this money is to save up for a house.\n\nAny suggestions would be highly appreciated!", "created_utc": 1562624844, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/carz13/semi_long_term_investing_is_x3_a_good_option/", "is_self": true}
