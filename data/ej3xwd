It was awesome and I felt badass. \n\nAround Dec 1st I told my gf I would stop trading since I was having sleepless nights, stress headaches, and was somewhat obsessed with this shit. I had to get back in.... and that bad karma made me lose on almost every trade and added $30,000 of real money (to get above $25k) which I lost as well and am down currently $32,000 of real money in additions to all the gains from November. \n\nHere are some highlights: \n\nLulu earnings Dec 11th: I felt it would do well on earnings and lost $22,050 on a $25,000 yolo 10 minutes after purchasing. (My first big guh moment and I f'ing KNEW not to do this) \n\nNVDA Dec 23rd: Bought $25,000 of 1/10 calls that dipped 30 minutes after buying... got weak hands... and lost $13,384. (I bought at the ATH at the time and felt it would just keep going up) \n\nAMD Dec 26th: Bought $15,000 of AMD $50 calls at $47.10 (1/3 and 1/10)... dipped immediately after buying... got weak hands a couple days ago on Dec 30th... and sold around $45.80 for a $11,800 loss. Now I see that fucker is up around $49 today and figured it might since $50 seems doable next week. Fuck me and my shitty decisions... I knew I should have held until today with CES next week but Trump bombing Iraq got me twitchy and I just wanted out. (My $3k would be worth $18k if I would have stayed in one more day) \n\nThe highlight of November was selling my $28k of DIS fd's... 2 hours prior to the stock rocketing up once subscriber numbers were released. I took a $9,000 loss instead of a $150k+ gain. I still got in afterwards and it went up $40k.... which I held until it was a $12k gain and sold. (Selling 368 contracts 2 hours before subscriber numbers came out still makes my heart want to explode) \n\nWell that's my story. Not sure why I am posting but it kinda feels therapeutic in a way to let this shit out. I haven't told anyone since 1. Most my friends wouldn't understand 2. My gf would probably be pissed I lied to her. I have $3,200 left in my restricted from purchasing Robinhood account that I am transferring over to WeBull and the funds should be there in 2 days. I am thinking with earnings this month I can turn this $3,200 around with some smart purchases instead of yolo'ing stupidly. But maybe fucking not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n [https://imgur.com/gallery/4kVnfVS](https://imgur.com/gallery/4kVnfVS)", "created_utc": 1577997747, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ej3xwd/ama_i_am_the_worlds_worst_trader_ask_me_anything/", "is_self": true}
