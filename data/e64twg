People assume the ad is implying that the husband is somehow forcing this Becky to use the bike and get in shape. Not true at all. Why is it so inconceivable that maybe she actually wanted it? She continues to broadcast her entire experience with the bike on social media, which is typical Becky behavior and not scandalous in the least. And it doesn\u2019t matter that she was not fat to begin with. That\u2019s not the point. The goal here is to build mental strength, discipline, and Instagram followers, not lose weight. Now Peloton is getting bigly exposure, and in this case the saying \u201cno bad press\u201d actually applies. This all benefits the company.\n\nOne of the criticisms of Peloton is that it is expensive. This is not necessarily true. Beckys spend more money on coffee each month than the cost to finance this bike. Beckys all around the country are just now learning of something they didn\u2019t know they wanted, and it is within their reach. \n\nIt's not just about the bike, either. Peloton used to appeal to just hardcore cyclists, but it is going mainstream. The subscription service has literally thousands of on-demand classes on running, cardio, strength, yoga, meditation, even walking. I have been a subscriber for the past six months and I have never even thought about owning the bike. I planned to cancel after the free trial but the service is so damn good. The instructors are all surprisingly encouraging and motivating, and you feel like you are part of something bigger. I have taken other workout classes, but there is something special about the Peloton people and brand. By the way, they claim to have a retention rate of 95%. \n\nNow let\u2019s talk about the stock.\n\nNo, it is not that expensive. Assuming they meet their sales estimates of 1.5B, the price to sales ratio is in the 7-8 range, which is in line with other tech companies like MSFT, AMZN, and NFLX. And yes, PTON is a tech company. \n\nRevenues are doubling every year, and this is before they have even reached the core Becky market. They have no long term debt. The CEO says they could be profitable now if they chose to slow down growth, and I actually believe him. They have no valid competitors. Yes, there are companies like Flywheel, Echelon, and SoulCycle, but they are all well behind Peloton and in no shape to become the frontrunner in this market. Go look at each of their websites and then look at Peloton\u2019s website. You\u2019ll see what I mean. \n\n2020 is going to be a massive year for Peloton. I predict sales will surge this Christmas and we will see that in their next earnings report. This is not WeWork. This is not a scam.
