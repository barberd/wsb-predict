{"id": "ffs1b2", "title": "Corona Calls: tests, vaccines, and cures", "selftext": "**tl;dr - tests (OPK, CODX, DGX, TMO, ILMN, VIVO), vaccines (INO, MRNA, MRNA, GILD, JNJ), cures (SPEX, REGN, VIR). If the patent optioned by SPEX which is a combination of SARS and MERS treatments does work, the constituent inhibitors will be needed (AFAIK,  AGN, LILLY, NVS) and antivirals will be administered no matter which inihibitor they choose (INO, MRNA, NOVAVAX, GILD, NVAX). Bad news though, most of the obscure picks here are DOWN, not up.... so maybe I should throw the whole DD away**\n\nWhile everyone is looking at puts, there are few opportunities for calls on companies that could help cure this virus. There are (at least) 3 obvious companies to buy calls on -- companies producing tests, vaccines, cures. Here's a list of the ones I can remember easily (in order of confidence/recent price moves):\n\nTests:\n\n- OPK\n- AIM\n- CODX\n- DGX\n- TMO\n- ILMN\n- HOLX\n- VIVO\n\n\nVaccines:\n\n- INO\n- MRNA\n- GILD\n- JNJ\n\nCure:\n\n- SPEX\n- REGN\n- VIR\n- ABBV\n- TAK\n\nObviously, the holy grail is the cure, but it would be foolish to put all your hope there.\n\nAll that's well and good, but here's the real juicy bit. There's a story circulating on Reddit right now (Hi chinese overlords?) [about a university in xiamen creating a 29 minute test](https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shine.cn%2Fnews%2Fnation%2F2003073683%2F). Some more searching has revealed that this tech *might* be the exact same that has been in use [in Israel](https://www.israel21c.org/israeli-company-develops-rapid-diagnostic-kit-for-covid-19/) ([short reddit discussion here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/ffpjn3/xiamen_university_steals_coronavirus_testing_idea/)). I'm too dumb to find an entity that I can buy calls on related to these but let's keep going -- because the closest I'm finding is SPEX. The [patent that SPEX executed an option on](https://patents.justia.com/patent/10434116) suggests that it is a *cure* that is based on previous SARS + MERS progress. Here's the TL;DR:\n\n> The present invention provides methods for treating a coronavirus infection. For example, treatment may be effected by administering a neurotransmitter inhibitor, a signaling kinase inhibitor, an estrogen receptor inhibitor, a DNA metabolism inhibitor or an anti-parasitic agent. Also provided are methods for treating a coronavirus infection in which an anti-viral drug also is administered during any of the described methods.\n\nThe patent is somewhat vague (and I don't understand all of it) but it works with a few steps:\n\n- administer a neurotransmitter inhibitor (chlorpromazine hydrochloride, triflupromazine hydrochloride, clomipramine hydrochloride, thiethylperazine maleate, chlorphenoxamine hydrochloride, promethazine hydrochloride, fluphenazine hydrochloride, thiothixene, fluspirilene, and benztropine mesylate)\n- administer a kinase signaling inhibitor (imatinib mesylate (Gleevec), nilotinib (Tasigna), and dasatinib)\n- administer a estrogen receptor inhibitor/anti-parasitic agent/dna metabolism inhibitor (gemcitabine hydrochloride)\n- administer an antiviral *during* the methods above (interferon, ribavirin, adefovir, tenofovir, acyclovir, brivudin, cidofovir, fomivirsen, foscarnet, ganciclovir, penciclovir, amantadine, rimantadine and zanamivir)\n\nThe way they are testing for it is that they administer 290 compounds, 33 of which activate when MERS, 102 activate for SARS, and 28 that activate when both MERS *or* SARS are present (the math doesn't add up, so not sure if a bunch of the compounds just don't activate consistently or if I misread). Read the patent for more, but basically, this cure is a mix of approaches effective on SARS/MERS.\n\nNow the question is, what company sells these? Because they're about to get a lot of orders:\n\n- <x> hydrochlorides lead me to [promethazine hydrochloride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promethazine) because it sounded familiar, and IMO it's way more widely available than the other stuff -- But all I can find are companies that *stopped* selling it -- Allergan (AGN)\n- gemcitabine hydrochloride (https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm?event=overview.process&ApplNo=020509) - LILLY\n- imatnib (https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/search.cfm?labeltype=all&query=Imatinib) -- lots of companies, but the only one I recognize is Novartis, and Mylan\n- antivirals (got lazy at this point) -- https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/01/26/5-biotech-stocks-to-watch-with-the-coronavirus-sca.aspx (lists the ones we already know, INO, MRNA, NOVAVAX, GILD, NVAX)\n\n**AND HERE IS WHERE THE D GOES SOFT**\n\nUnfortunately, all of the more obscure plays are *slightly red* right now -- I don't know if I'm ahead, or if none of this actually means anything. If anyone is a biologist/researcher in here, please help out because I spend my time touching keyboards, not pipettes. Specifically:\n\n- There have to be massive amounts of companies I'm missing, please help if you know any more (even ones I've just left out here).\n- Am I right on the idea?\n- Which companies specialize in DNA testing? The tests that Israel is doing (and supposedly xiamen just started doing) are DNA based -- I can't tell if this is the same -- but it [looks like they are](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_transcription_polymerase_chain_reaction) -- calls should maybe be also going on the biggest companies that do this kind of testing (TMO, CODX, ILMN)\n\nI am not your financial advisor, do with this information what you wish -- do your own research and please report back if you see anything juicy.\n\n[EDIT] - Added HOLX (thanks /u/fanofpotatoes)\n\n[EDIT] - Added ABBV (thanks /u/tooch_my_gooch)\n\n[EDIT] - /u/IWasRightOnce with the context on INO:\n\n> This thing is dead on arrival and this company does this every few years with literally every new disease/virus. \n> They pump up their share price by announcing a vaccine, then they do stock offering to raise cash\n\nBe ye warned -- I'm in stocks so I can afford to wait out another pump, but maybe don't buy some short expiry weekly calls on INO.\n\n[EDIT] - Added TAK (thanks /u/Y0L0_Cholo)\n\n[EDIT] - Added AIM (thanks /u/cnclardy)", "created_utc": 1583745659.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffs1b2/corona_calls_tests_vaccines_and_cures/", "is_self": true}
