A Nintendo direct is happening at 6:00 pm ET, which will [reportedly be announcing a release of Overwatch for the switch next month](https://kotaku.com/overwatch-comes-to-switch-next-month-1837868458). When Diablo 3 hit the Switch, it sold over 100k units in two days.  Overwatch is a slightly better game than D3, and more importantly it has way better porn than Diablo. Also there are many more switches on the market now than there were a year ago (\\~35k switch units sold), so this is gonna bode well for $ATVI.  \n\n\nBest of all, this is happening right when World of Warcraft classic is blowing a giant nostalgia load all over the faces of 04' teens.  They started with 6 servers, and now have way the fuck more.  [With Classic killing everyone's expectations, the stock has already taken a nice jump](https://www.barrons.com/articles/activision-blizzard-stock-buy-world-of-warfare-videogame-remaster-51567609509). WoW is the top game on Twitch right now and we still don't know exactly what the new WoW Subscriber count is, but once they release that I expect another nice little bump.  \n\n\nTL;DR  \nTauren Gang loves $ATVI", "created_utc": 1567622071, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/czoudz/calls_on_atvi_tracer_waifu_edition/", "is_self": true}
