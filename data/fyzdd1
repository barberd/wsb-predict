{"id": "fyzdd1", "title": "USA new cases are not plateauing", "selftext": "I had thought that we had peaked as this is what the White House has been saying, but this is absolutely not the case. The # of new cases is directly proportional to the number of tests administered. Last week the testing limit was about 100k daily. This week it's 150k. That's why we went from 20k-something new dailies to 30k-something. ( we also saw a spike on April 4th when 200,00 tests were conducted)  The virus is only as big as the number of tests undertaken, and no one is really calling out this basic material fact out. There are still not enough tests to gauge the scope of this. The only true indicator is the death rate which lag's about 2 weeks behind infection and I expect will start to climb dramatically over the coming weeks. \n\n[https://covidtracking.com/data/us-daily](https://covidtracking.com/data/us-daily)", "created_utc": 1586591082.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fyzdd1/usa_new_cases_are_not_plateauing/", "is_self": true}
