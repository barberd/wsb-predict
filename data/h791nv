Airlines take full deposits upfront and UAL did not start giving refunds on international travel until this week. That means that they have HUGE amounts of cash on their balance sheet that is about to be returned to customers given that they finally had to start refunding as of this week (or the DOT was going to sue them). They have officially been refunding in DROVES meaning their balance sheet for Q2 could be worse than DAL, LUV, and AAL who were refunding prior.\n2. Airlines derive their revenue by something called yield. This represents the amount of money brought in from an individual flights. The majority of this comes from the folks upfront: high net worth individuals and corporations; furthermore, the majority of profit comes from these people flying internationally. High net worth people have rented homes in Hamptons, Aspen etc and are not going on planes unless necessary (or they're flying private) and corporations won't be traveling in large numbers until mid-2021. At this point, I posit that yield is at AN ALL TIME LOW. Yield is not derived from 14% of travelers who decide to spontaneously go to LA for a $439 fare from New York in lie flat business, it's derived from the executive who needs to go to LA for an hour long meeting and spends $4300 on that same seat or the heiress who buys two of them (one for her dog).\n\ntldr: airlines had cash they need to return to consumers on their balance sheet as of Q1. think about how airlines make profit (expensive tickets which are not being sold) and consider when they will make money again (especially given that they have new debt servicing, even at free interest rates, that does not mean free on a balance sheet)", "created_utc": 1591917572.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h791nv/dd_ual_you_have_all_missed_the_point/", "is_self": true}
