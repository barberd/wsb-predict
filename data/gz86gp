Today I made close to $15k (edit: now its closer to $19k)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuring the first week of may I was looking at calls for my birthday on all of the biggest stocks (August 21). When I looked at BRK.B I noticed that the $185 call was floating around $4.00 a contract. (The shares were around $170 a share) I'm holding onto the contracts and I'll realize it on my birthday for a nice happy birthday to me giving me some nice tendies. I started my journey with $1000 and a dream. I opened my first trading account on Christmas of 2018 at the low of the crash. I put my savings that I had earned over the summer and let it grow. I quickly made a little over $2000 by the next summer. After returning to school in September I wanted to increase my trading, and turned on margin trading. I daytraded it from September to January and grew it to about $5K. And dumped it all into a put on Tesla: one $800 put and two $765 puts. It was flying up and it was about $900 a share and climbing. The put expired on 3/6. Fortunately, unfortunately, the pandemic hit and tesla crashed to about $700 when my put exercised. I held the 2 $765 puts until the expiration date and sold the $800 put on Feb. 28th for a profit of $9,920 or 358% (I'll add a pic below that I took before it was sold). I sold the two other puts on the day of expiration for $12.5K. I showed my grandpa my returns and he gave me a loan for $200k to trade. I invested back into the market at the bottom of the V recovery within 5% above the bottom. I took my tendies and the loan money and I've also been selling at the money cash covered puts. I've been wheeling the stocks that were exercised and used it to have buy-ins lower than the market was. All of the stocks that have been exercised has drove me to get about $15K in profits today alone. Since I started writing I've made $3k. Rather than YOLO-ing profits from YOLOs we should be autists here but not 100% autist. I'll put a poll as to what I should do with the profits from my Berkshire call tendies, I'll hold the contract for now probably until expiration unless the autists here have a different opinion.\n\nThank you for your support! The YOLOing knowledge I've gained from this subreddit has helped me pay off my car and part of my student loan (I didn't but I have my gains realized in cash in the account to sell cash covered puts)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Sorry for not attaching the pics I took.......thanks for pointing it out (for my privacy I hid my user and full portfolio) here they are:\n\nAlso my portfolio is 45% invested in TSLA, 10% in AMZN, 10% in Ford, 10% in MSFT, and the rest is between the other stocks I have (pic included below)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[$800 call on TSLA right before I sold it](https://preview.redd.it/4rilp40bfr351.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b661eead4017cff4321ac1af3028ea2f36d3b5c)\n\n[Here are the two $765 puts I had right before they sold](https://preview.redd.it/kimzu0h5gr351.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b06880106340f23fdb52e817078fb4227ec92d7)\n\n[Account balance, daily change, and cash in account](https://preview.redd.it/933ud3nfgr351.png?width=335&format=png&auto=webp&s=f188acfd624c4fcbf1a78eda0cbfd6e41af202a0)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Berkshire Hathaway call](https://preview.redd.it/67v1isu6lr351.png?width=951&format=png&auto=webp&s=31029249e4c9f0225b461b03ffffc7ee3f4042c0)\n\nBecause everyone is hyped over NKLA I'm proud to say I got in two weeks ago:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/txohmpjrmr351.png?width=952&format=png&auto=webp&s=907d7b2fd6830442375847bdd78d5830b32e2d77\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Here are all of the stocks I'm currently holding](https://preview.redd.it/cqo4oqwwmr351.png?width=113&format=png&auto=webp&s=e389a46ecef15a16065f4ce42fdd240fcce0b96d)\n\nAre the Autists, who said my claims were fake, happy?", "created_utc": 1591650445.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gz86gp/yoloing_my_account_into_tsla_puts_before_the/", "is_self": true}
