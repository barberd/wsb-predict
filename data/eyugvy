Monopoly on EV battery market.\n\nCurrently, there is no competitor on the market like Apple made smartphone but there is no Samsung and Android think about that.\n\nNow, everyone want to buy EV as new car and there is TSLA nothing else. TSLA monopoly on EV market. I believe TSLA will be next APPLE but much stronger and bigger it feels TSLA is APPLE in 2008 when they just announce first iPhone and smartphone is just start to become popular.\n\nIf TSLA produce 25k for model 3 everyone will buy TSLA and about 80% vehicle on road will be EV probably in a decade. In that case TSLA could hit trillion for sure.", "created_utc": 1580840732, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eyugvy/why_people_think_tsla_is_overvalued/", "is_self": true}
