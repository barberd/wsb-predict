I dont fucking know, but what I do know is that $ETSY will continue giving me tendies.\n\nWhy you ask? sit down, let me fucking tell you.\n\nWhat is ETSY? in short, its a platform where Becky makes homemade bullshit for Karen to buy.\n\nBecky may or may not get the corona splattered on her face. Either way, she'll be home. Making useless shit to sell and ship to Karen. Karen will love it. Thinking she's supporting her peer and will over pay for said useless bullshit. Fuck Karen. Fuck Becky. I dont give a Fuck. Now stand up. Walk over here.\n\nLast night they beat earnings. They got noticed (cause who the fuck cared about ETSY). Logical retards have thoughts like the above. They buy in. Analysts upgrade prices (to $64-$72). I make money.\n\nTrust me. my phone is at 100%. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zztny51qcij41.jpg?width=1242&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=845f5473c8d160223e6fc94c6ecc6938f62e1cd6", "created_utc": 1582827342, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fag9dc/yall_sleeping_on_etsy/", "is_self": true}
