Every day, as a bunch of new information comes in, model predictions get adjusted (and also model becomes better). To predict a future stock price, you must predict where that huge aggregated model is wrong today and how will it adjust with new information. Is the model wrong? Yes. Is it wrong by lot? Usually not, unless there are a bunch if black swan type of events just around the corner. Can you predict where is it wrong with you peasant level of information availability? No.\n\nBut sometimes you have more information, you just do not realize it. For example, when all 10 of your wife's boyfriends start talking about buying Teslas next year, it might be a good anecdotal evidence to buy some Tesla stock. Or if your mother is a PHD in epidemiology and she tells you in early February  that corona will fuck US up 100%.\n\nTL;DR: puts, just because.", "created_utc": 1587390092.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g4szjr/why_you_autistic_kids_can_never_reliably_predict/", "is_self": true}
