SPG Simon Property", "selftext": "As many of you retards shit talk my last DD on $WORK missed out on the tendies, I come back to give you a second chance. Reason why SPG has massive upside:\n\n1) FED is making it clear that stock can only goes up and looking at the undervalue stock names, we have SPG with actual profit last earning and good dividends while it\u2019s still in the low compare to the rest of this bubble market.\n\n2) Company bankrupts, mall is doomed? Nope, when one retail closed, another will takes its place. SPG owns real estates and collecting rents, they don\u2019t care who bankrupt and who thrive. You simply don\u2019t lose if you own real estates in this country.\n\n3) Last consumers report indicates an increase in retail spendings as many states open up and personally, the women in my household is so eager to get back to shopping at the mall and I believe mall traffic will be back sooner than we anticipate\n\nTL;DR: SPG July and August calls 75-90\nMy position: \nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/YdfhTc3\n\nMy last DD that earned me -100 karma from the gay bears : https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gzs4gx/unusual_call_volume_on_work_for_the_next_2_weeks/", "created_utc": 1592500686.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hbiwe0/back_with_another_quality_dd_spg_simon_property/", "is_self": true}
