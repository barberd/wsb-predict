{"id": "drrymj", "title": "First go at options: How did I earn 100% profit?", "selftext": "I have been doing a bit of reading about how options work and wanted to get my hands dirty with minimum risk so today I bought a put on UAA (After their crash, it was already down 16-17% by the time I bought) for 0.28 (17.50 11/08). Within a couple of hours I was up 100% on the contract and since I had decided to not be greedy and set a limit of 0.56, got sold. However, the thing I didn't understand from concepts I had learnt was, how did I make 100% profit because even though contract was ITM, I hadn't reached the breakeven point by the time it got sold. On the other hand, the Uber put (32.5 put 11/08) which I had bought on Friday was only up around 15-20% even when that was ITM at a similar level almost throughout the market hours.\n\nI guess what I am asking is, how is the contract price determined at a given point. I have screenshots of the return and price of the stocks at given point, although I should also have captured greeks as they seem to have a lot to do with the price of the contract. I was reading up on the price of an option and I found this formula on [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/pricing-options-2019-06-10](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/pricing-options-2019-06-10)\n\n**Intrinsic value + Time value + Volatility value = Price of Option**\n\nThis brings me to my next question. Based on this, my Uber put should be at least (32.5-29.35=3.15) assuming uber opens at 29.35 tomorrow irrespective of IV crush? My assumption here is that the time value hasn't changed greatly(theta is -0.09 or so) and volatility(vega=0.01 or so) won't be negative. Please correct me if I am wrong here.
