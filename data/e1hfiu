{"id": "e1hfiu", "title": "Cvm might tank or shoot up", "selftext": "Cvm has been in the business for far too long in a bad way: its Multikine therapy has been in phase 3 for basically forever, partly because the FDA has been scratching its head as to whether it is actually a safe therapy for neck and head cancer. The stock has been pumped a lot recently due to a lot of seeking alpha articles (which are written by the friends of the CEO btw). However, I noticed that there\u2019s an insane short position on this stock (22000 open interest for january puts). If cvm\u2019s phase 3 tanks (and there is a large chance that it will due to over 300 patient deaths), this stock will hit 0. \n\nNow, I also bought a 15 dollar call just in case their phase 3 absolutely rocks. Either way, I would say that this thing is either gonna rocket up or crater, so do your DD and pick a side (or both sides as I did).", "created_utc": 1574695179, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e1hfiu/cvm_might_tank_or_shoot_up/", "is_self": true}
