Oil / Gas + Return to Normalcy", "selftext": "***TLDR***: Everyone knows the numbers this quarter GDP / housing would be shot, and next are going to be even worse, but they are looking at signs of consumption for a clue as to when we will recover. Gas inventories dropped, vs. an expected build. Crude oil inventories did not grow as much as thought. GILD dropped another \"positive\" note regarding their drug. These three were enough to overcome the other negative data, today.\n\nhttps://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/\n\n Oil: As stated above, crude oil inventories were did not grow by as much as expected. Everyone has thought, oh, Cushing, OK is out of inventory, we haven't cut enough domestic production, we're going to keep building stock, run out of room, and oil is going to go negative again. Well, no, physically, there has been enough inventory there and there will continue to be, but, all this is leased out already. There are still major issues regarding oil production vs. consumption and I expect the supply chain issues with oil will build into mid May. At the moment, they are breathing a sigh of relief, and moving to the next phase.\nhttps://twitter.com/Ole_S_Hansen/status/1255505696273113089/photo/1 Edit: Corrected this point based on a comment and tweet - was not accurate at first.\n\nGas: An increase in driving can already be seen, as states have begun to reopen. What had been expected, is even with an increase in driving, refineries were still producing and would have added to stores. With this in mind, I would argue gas consumption is a major indicator of a second wave, and should be a red flag for us. Guidelines for reopening indicated 14 days of sustained decline in # new cases are needed to support reopening. No one has done this, but we're going ahead 'merica style. Big implications for a reduction in the rate of reduction in new cases (ie.: we might not \"peak\" again, but the slope away from the peak will not drop as fast as we thought) and the possibility that hot spots will flair in the mid-west and south.\n\nGILD: The market is ready to die or moon based on GILD. We saw this last week, with a crash and recovery based off a leaked report (negative) and the same thing two weeks ago (positive). The study has been beaten to death on here, go find some write ups on it for more. Today, we have good news, we are moon. Effectively, nothing has changed regarding GILD, as we knew what was released already. \n\n\nSomething has to give, but today seems to be a relief rally. Relief, that our economy won't grind to a halt tomorrow. Supply chains are OK, if damaged and slower. We have major issues building, and from a bear market case perspective, the jump in SPY is really not a bad sign. If you believe that we will have a longer recovery than the market is pricing, here is another chance to get in. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9h9np/an_indepth_look_into_the_next_few_weeks/ Here is some real DD for you to build your next month's plan off of. Lots of potential moon / crater triggers, based on how you view the market.\n\nPositions/ My General Outlook/ Crystal Ball: NFA NFA NFA: QQQ/SPY June Puts, Mid May we will see an end of the rally based on major outbreaks of CV in the mid-west, further supply disruptions to the food industry, June WTI contract expiring, continuned signs of unemployment being here to stay in the midterm.
