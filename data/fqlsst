I told them I have a win win situation backed by your boi J Pow.\n\nTake out a SBA loan for $1m. Just create a fake hedge fund and show some expenses. I think this sub would be able to do that given all the fake screenshot YOLOs that are posted. \n\nNext put that $1m into some boring as fuck company like WFC, etc. Something that will pay 7%+ in dividends so like 70k a year.  \n\nNow here is the beauty of the situation. The SBA loan is interest free for the first year aka first one is free for options yolo. After that it is a paltry 3.75% per year. \n\nYou could either pay the loan back after first year and collect a free 7% dividend. Alternatingly you could just hold the stock and collect the difference every year. \n\nGranted WFC could go lower but who gives a fuck. Just reinvest those dividends at a cheaper price until it gets back to a profit. \n\nThe kicker. Your boi J Pow would never let the banks collapse.\n\nI call this the free money to making free money approach. Aka trickle down economics. \n\nWho is in with me?", "created_utc": 1585407852.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqlsst/free_money_idea/", "is_self": true}
