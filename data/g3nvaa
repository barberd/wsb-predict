The optimism is that the FED and US government can support the economy for a few quarters and therefore it doesn't matter that 2020 earnings are a COMPLETE write off - investors are looking to 2021 earnings and trying to price those in and are optimistic we will have a quick bounce back in the economy and 2021 EPS will bounce back with it.\n\nTherefore anything that puts 2021 earnings in jeopardy could cause a massive repricing of equities to the downside, and cause risk assets to converge with 2020 earnings expectations which have continued to fall even as the rally extends upwards. There is now a HUGE divergence between 2020 earnings expectations and equity prices.\n\nLook at the divergence between 12m forward earnings expectations and the Nasdaq:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s3ix3726xkt41.png?width=1115&format=png&auto=webp&s=59df183ccd225c91b1c8d3212a9941e7d0aa91f1\n\nAnother user has also pointed out the divergence between the VIX and realized vol in the S&P, there are an awful lot of divergences in the markets because of optimism about 2021 - vol remains high now but the consensus is that there will be lower vol in the future.\n\nWe are at a point in the market now where we are beginning to reprice equities for both effective treatment of the virus (remdesivir) and re-opening of the economy. If a second wave of infections does begin - even if it's not that many infections - it could really spook investors with equity prices where they are currently. That being said, I no longer thing we will see some dramatic random \"rug-pull\" out of nowhere, I think that equities are going to reprice in a nasty way if there is any meaningful second wave. Another user also pointed out that a secondary wave could occur in another country and paint a picture for the future - which could spook investors before a second wave in the USA.\n\nFellow gay bears, I think the truth is there needs to be a real catalyst for more downside - specifically something that spooks investors about 2021 earnings expectations. List of things this could be (feel free to think of your own):\n\n1. Secondary wave(s) of infections\n2. Lockdown/mass unemployment continues for approx another 60 days which would mark the end of \"90-day grace period for credit card, mortgage and auto loan/lease payments\" - [JPM Q1 2020 earnings presentation](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/corporate/investor-relations/document/b087dc23-d2fd-4dd7-8022-c3ca70e7e46f.pdf)causing a lot of defaults. I'm assuming grace periods are similar at other major banks.\n3. Increasing bankruptcy rates of businesses causing damage to long term economic growth prospects.\n4. Firms start to be more pessimistic in their guidance about growth prospects for the next 24 months.\n5. It becomes apparent that the FED and US government no longer have the capacity to support the economy for the next 1 to 2 quarters (not very likely).\n6. Virus mutation/new strains.\n\nThink I'm going to sell all my May 15th puts and roll them into June/July.\n\nTL;DR: Investors are very optimistic about 2021 earnings - that doesn't mean they are wrong, but if there is a second wave of infections or similar catalyst its going to be ugly ... for the bulls ;) . But until that happens STONKS ONLY GO UP, MONEY PRINTER GO BRRR etc. Or I'm completely wrong and we circuit breaker on Monday, honestly who the fuck knows.  \n\n\nEdit: fixed JPM link.
