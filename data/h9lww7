(That means the state is essentially choosing the value of the stock moving forward, and has a vested interest in a positive outcome).\n* Regulators have already approved the deal. Literally good to go upon approval.\n* Every dip there has been a massive amount of dark pool movement. Some of this activity is likely from a large hedge that often bets on bankruptcies with a high success rate.\n* As a result of the latest developments, Bank of America cut its PG&E price target from $14 to $12.20, but the firm maintains a Buy rating on the stock.\n\n**The bad:**\n\n* Victims will be payed out of the next few months in shares. They will be locked for 90 days. After that timeframe it's safe to assume people will be dumping stock quickly to pull cash out leading to a likely dip over the longer term.\n* A lot of people are pump and dumping their riskier 6/19 $15c. Don\u2019t fall victim to buying these when a $12c is a much more likely jump.\n* A general dip in the economy like we just saw is still going to sting companies like PG&E.\n* No matter the outcome, this stock is extremely volatile. Don\u2019t let institutions and algo companies eat your ass by second guessing your buy.\n* There is a high wildfire risk in California throughout the next few months.\n\nI\u2019ll keep this post alive and updated with feedback from the comments, but for anyone curious **I picked up 6/19 12c and 12.5c lotos today**, and I plan on buying more before the market closes.", "created_utc": 1592245798.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h9lww7/the_pcg_dds_youve_been_reading_didnt_pull_the/", "is_self": true}
