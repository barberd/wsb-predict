{"id": "hdw4lb", "title": "Is Canon poised to fire?", "selftext": "Let me start off by saying I may be fully retarded, and have mostly no idea what I am doing. I am posting this as I currently see it as a potentially good opportunity and would like thoughts to the contrary. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter dusting my camera off today, I thought \"huh, I wonder how Canon's stocks are doing.\" I had never even thought to look into them before, but what I found seems promising. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe company typically trades comfortably within the $25-$30 range for most of the last 5 years. The lowest it hit with the Covid spike was $19 and change. Compared to most companies, this is next to nothing. Since then, it has been on a slow and steady rise. Obviously nothing has significantly changed in the company from then to now, so it would seem likely the company is still worth what it was pre lockdown, and I am sure sales will fall the next ER, but it is my assumption that is already priced in. That's why there was such a drop, because expectation was that all sales would be down for most companies between then and summer ERs. So I feel like we are at, or very close to, bottom on this thing. \n\nThis got me considering exactly how much sales might fall, and from which sectors. Sure, base consumer sales would be assumed to fall, but even the extent of that is in the air. Of course there will be a drop, but america was also handed $1200 each. Now, for many this was needed and didn't go far enough, but, for others, it was found money. Found money to go along with all of the other entertainment dollars which were going unspent. It doesn't seem too great a leap to me, to consider that the solo, isolated hobby of photography might have picked up a few new recruits. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBeyond that though, canon isn't just cameras. It is office supplies. Printers, combination printers, and webcams all became a necessity to a multitude of people as thousands and thousands of home offices opened shop. An article I found from fall of last year mentioned a lowered outlook due to a decline in these sales areas, yet the stock continued to rise. This may have had the untended consequence of breathing some like back into those areas. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom here, I wondered whether they were players in the bodycam industry. Other, barely known stocks have increased 100%+ over the last month thanks to the civil unrest. From what I found, it does seem that Canon has a dog in that race as well. It appears over the last handful of years, Canon has acquired various businesses that fit that niche. I have not done a lot of research into them yet to know how strong the plays are, but they do seem to be there. If that is the case, and those companies are half way competent in the market and jockeying for position, then this doesn't seem to be priced into Canon either as there have been no noticeable bumps similar to those experienced by other self surveillance companies. \n\nBeyond that, there is just decent press on the company like the fact they have 2 highly anticipated new cameras and 6 new lenses being announced in July. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, I decided to jump in, and from what I can discern, options seem to be cheap. There does not appear to be much IV at play, and the premiums for time appear to be very reasonable. They are a bit unstable as there is not a lot of options volume, and honestly, I am not entirely sure yet on how to assume a good price on an option exactly, but. From my layman's perspective, they seem like good value. Now, there are considerable gaps currently between many of the ask and bids. This is where my lack of knowledge leaves me in the weeds as to how much of that is too high of an ask compared to too low a bid. I went ahead and dipped my toe into a handful was able to buy a few well below ask and not too much above bid. Even ones out to September seem like a good deal. I had some bids in on those trying to get a slightly lower price, but those didn't pan out. Come Monday I will most likely raise my bid and I am sure I will get them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, that is what I am looking at. I know this isn't necessarily DD, just my observation from the most rudimentary understanding of these things. I have appreciated finding the occasional good post which led me towards something I never would have considered otherwise, so I would love some discussion from those more versed in these things as to variables I might be overlooking, things I may be under/overvaluing, and opinions or guidance on good value calls in this situation.", "created_utc": 1592845234.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hdw4lb/is_canon_poised_to_fire/", "is_self": true}
