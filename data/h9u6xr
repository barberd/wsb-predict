LITERALLY every motherfucker that lives in the suburbs is buying guns right now, flexing 2nd Amendment because they are terrified of these riots. I went to a local gun shop thats only open 2 days a week when I was out on my bike ( motorcycle) you pussies, and the owner told me hes only been busier one other time and that was in like 2012. This guy had like 12  people working there and this place is not big. He said online purchases are up like 500%, he cant even keep up with the shit. And this guy has very few \"exotics\" so the basic  shit hes selling means other people are just straight up sold out of them all over the country. Gun manufacturers are going to crush earnings. \n\nCALLS ON SMITH & WESSON for Thursday", "created_utc": 1592272901.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h9u6xr/2nd_amendment_for_tendies/", "is_self": true}
