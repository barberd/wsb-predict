But I was so tired of all of you posting fucking beautiful money shots that I decided to buy a shit load of 4.20 Feb 14 bets... bought them at .45 when TSLA seemed to be giving back its gains. But then it started moving as if I had made a 2000 call!!! The more it went up, the more my puts went up. Went from .40 to 1.67 finished at 1.25 although actually 50 bucks away from my direction at the time I bought... any suggestions? Obviously I hold cuz I\u2019m a retard and I\u2019m not here for a 400 gain, although I\u2019ve lost me ass. I\u2019m in my last bet hopes!
