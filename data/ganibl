{"id": "ganibl", "title": "Airlines Undervalued right now?", "selftext": "Am I retarded or does it seem like the airlines will make it out fine through the crisis even without the help of the governement\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnited Arlines said they from April 1st - 14th they had 200,000 passengers which is down from 6,000,00 from the same time in 2019 and with an average profit per passenger being $17.25  they made a weekly revenue of 1.75m compared to 53m which is a $50m loss on passengers alone weekly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n50m$ does sound like a lot but with this being as bad as it gets and travel pretty much to be guranteed a steady increase arn't airlines fine? Let alone the 5b+ government aid to help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso UAL has 2.7B in cash and 52B in assets and with a 50m$ weeekly loss they could last for over a year before bankruptcy (or i may be retarded).  Also their biggest expense is salaries with 12b and fuel 9B and with 96,000 employees, of which 20,000 so far decalred they are willing to go on a leave of absence and united announcing that they will roll out a leave of absence program etc surely they should be good right?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIdk made this spreadsheet in the past 20 mins just fking around so dont take it as 100% accurate \n\n [https://gyazo.com/168437036ed2a58cc881d108031950b9](https://gyazo.com/168437036ed2a58cc881d108031950b9) ", "created_utc": 1588214895.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ganibl/airlines_undervalued_right_now/", "is_self": true}
