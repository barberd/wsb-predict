The child took to the battlefields of Robinhood on 4/29 at 3am with intel that Apple and Amazon are going to win the Q1 battle! With bold intentions eating away from the flames that consume his pockets; he buys at open 3 SPY 5/1 299c and 1 AAPL 5/1 307.5c because guaranteed green dildo = unlimited tendies. \n\n    After watching his SPY calls go tits up he checks on his Apple calls, they are up +40%. Whilst in a panic wondering to sell he picks at his autist sized brain and says I\u2019m tired and falls asleep at 11am!! Wakes up at 3pm just in time for the Apple climb!! Child is now bagholding SPY calls with the Apple calls keeping his profits still on the horizon, a true diamond-hooved \ud83d\udc02. Come market close the child is hopeful in the Q1 battle with Apple and the bomb the SPY DESERVES. 4pm and DOWN GOES FRAISER!! AFTER HOURS TRADING DOWN -3%!! Apples Q1 final battle at 5pm with earnings call, listening every seconds, grasping these numbers daddy Cook is throwing at me. oh, my, tendies, Apple beats expectations!!! Sprint to Robinhood to check price, annnnd DOWN -8%!!! \n\nThe child with diamond hooves gets up and stomps his feet, forever cementing his calls until expiration. \n\nWhilst staying up late, hatching Q1 battle plans, checks the S&P 500 Futures for one last hope, just to find the price testing new lows for the day. Now whilst prepping for his premarket hour slumber, prays to the tendy gods and asks for the SPY to shove a green dildo so far up his ass he is spitting out The Feds cum until he gags and cashes out. \n\n\nWhilst the diamond hooved child sleeps the\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b finally reveals himself in the dreams. Dancing around a red candle with a wick to the ceiling but it has already been burnt. The child tries to open his robinhood account but the \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b pounces and lays his giant SPY 260p into him, shattering those beautiful, strong and robust diamond hooves into weak diamond paws. The boy wakes up in a sweat to find his portfolio up +400%, whilst celebrating his victory of the Q1 war he looks over to the corner of his room, noticing out of the corner of his eye, smiling like his mouth was broken from his jaw, the \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b. The child is still dreaming, awaiting his 5/1 expiration dating with the fear of a 1000 soldiers forever lost at sea. \n\nThe End.", "created_utc": 1588326123.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gbf4rg/diamond_hooved/", "is_self": true}
