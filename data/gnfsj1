You think because you're up 30% the last few months you are untouchable. That's exactly how people felt in 08-09'. The volume of the SPY is steadily falling. The rally for the last few months has been losing steam, GDP projections are set to be -35%, unemployment at 30%, there is a virus killing people. But money makes you blind, so I understand why you bulls are so star studded. The same thing happened to me back in march when i made 20K on the VIX, I thought it would last forever.

Have fun while you can, and don't get lost in the sauce.", "created_utc": 1589995985.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gnfsj1/irrational_exuberance/", "is_self": true}
