{"id": "fo78j9", "title": "The weekend DD was right", "selftext": "Whaddaya know. The multiple DDs this weekend were correct in calling this short rally. This is the first time I\u2019ve actually received sound investing advice from this subreddit. You degenerates are usually yolo-ing all of your hard-earned money (or parent\u2019s money) into terrible options decisions with no sound fundamentals or DD. It\u2019s a wonder that someone hasn\u2019t stepped in to stop you retards from throwing so much money away. It should be illegal to lose how much money you pea-brained shiteaters manage to shovel down the drain. \n\n\nI digress. Shoutout to u/Variation-Separate , u/scarvesandsuspenders and u/bigd0g111. Also to anyone else who called it I guess but who cares cause you didn\u2019t make a post. Thanks for the tendies big brains", "created_utc": 1585064643.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fo78j9/the_weekend_dd_was_right/", "is_self": true}
