{"id": "g0fs1d", "title": "Why the bullish case is based on a false premise", "selftext": "Now, before we get started, I am one of the cucks in here who went from 6k->100k->60k. \n\nWhile I don\u2019t want to repeat the same shit everyone else is spreading, I can\u2019t for the life of me see what the media frenzy is all about when it comes to the plateau or decrease of cases. As we stand, New York accounts for nearly 1/3 of the USA\u2019s total cases, and our daily increase also represents a similar figure. On a population basis however, New York represents about 6-7% of the United States population as a whole. \n\nNew York IS going to see its peak in the next few weeks, and New York WILL be able to begin gradually returning to work. If you think that\u2019s enough to prop the markets up, then there you have the Bull case and it\u2019s a done deal. However, we still have states like Florida, Texas, California, and more that have yet to see the worst of it or even a decline in cases. Texas, Florida, and California represent about 30% of the US population so while we may see a slight decrease in cases across America in 2 weeks, the daily case numbers will 100% spike back up when these states start peaking.\n\nHere begs the question: so how will we go about this as a country? \n\nThe answer is going to be IMO what determines where the markets go from the end of April forward. \n\nThe BULL Case:\nIf Trump reopens commerce after New York peaks, he is effectively opening everyone up to infection and saying fuck it. \n\nThe BEAR Case:\nIf he realizes we have to keep states like Florida and Texas on lockdown and disallow travel from those states to COVID hotspots, the markets will realize the impacts that are going to be incurred on business everywhere and panic selling will ensue.\n\nIn my humble autistic 19 year-old opinion, we aren\u2019t yet finished with this beast and our 30+ year resident expert doesn\u2019t think so either. We are going to either infect the whole country and devastate our healthcare system or devastate the economy, there isn\u2019t a way to take care of both. The beer flu will be here through the end of June at least and Wall Street won\u2019t be ready for the hurt. Look to places like Italy and Spain to try and catch what might be coming in the future, they will likely figure it out before we do.\n\nTLDR;\nIf you think Donnie Pump is going to elect for herd immunity: buy calls.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t autistic: buy puts.\n\n6/19 SPY $220\n\n9/18 SPY $200\n\n4/24 USO $6\n\nEdit:\nTo add on to this, even if we all went back to work tomorrow, the deleveraging has begun and it will be difficult to stop even if JPOW prints $10T which I think is very likely. If this virus is around for a while, that $10T will not be enough to fix our deflationary cycle, and we will need to reform how our economy is structured in terms of self sufficiency. This will mean shirt term pain for long term gain/sustainability as an economic system. This runs deeper than wall street, buckle up for the next few years because it\u2019s going to be bumpy.\n\nEdit 2: portfolio\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/ozquXTY", "created_utc": 1586770764.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0fs1d/why_the_bullish_case_is_based_on_a_false_premise/", "is_self": true}
