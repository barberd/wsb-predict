{"id": "e9ecj1", "title": "LULU and \"priced in\" earnings beats", "selftext": "ima keep posting this until i get an answer lmao shitty mods keep taking my stuff down\n\nHey  y'all, I got a question that's been boggling my mind for a bit now.   Are earnings based on guidance set in the previous quarter? For example,   Company A sees Q2 guidance of 1B revenue and 1.5 EPS. Does that mean   Company A's estimates for Q2 are 1B revenue and 1.5 EPS? If the answer  is no because estimates may change depending upon news that may impact   Company A's revenue and profit, then how does a company's earnings   become \"priced in\". In essence, LULU's earnings beat on revenue and EPS   estimates and their guidance was in-line; however, it's down 5% AH.   While I understand it's up about 90% YoY, shouldn't this be reflected in   their estimates? thanks guys", "created_utc": 1576103214, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e9ecj1/lulu_and_priced_in_earnings_beats/", "is_self": true}
