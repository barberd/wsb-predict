Pow fans, and bears of various sexual orientations,\n\nI'm a traveler of economies bull and bear, and have become weary of dry and stale discussions on the (de)merits of HEXO. I have come to this board for some refreshing insight.\n\nFluff aside, what is your take on HEXO ? I'm questioning my own reasoning, because I have high hopes for the company. I thought them cool from the start. And they have delivered some coolness, but nothing profit wise.\n\nThe company just amassed about 100MIL in the last month, on top of 80 MIL in cash, and 93 MIL in inventory. Market cap : 275 MIL ; ST debt : 69 MIL ; operation costs : about 25 MIL per quarter. (All figures in Eh-dollars)\n\nI think that's good stuff ; not Warren Buffets cup of tea, but enough to get me excited.\n\nWhat's your take ?
