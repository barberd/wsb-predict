Lost a decent chunk of the money I was able to save but I couldn't resist after I made 3k in one day then went on to lose 60% now. But anyway I've got all my eggs in one basket again, if GM stock maybe gains half of what it lost by end of the month? maybe middle next month? Then I can go back to being a gay degenerate. Also I'm retarded and have no idea what I'm doing but that goes without saying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLosses here [https://imgur.com/a/Bex2Ey9](https://imgur.com/a/Bex2Ey9)\n\nEdit: Position\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/1sAIISn](https://imgur.com/a/1sAIISn)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit2: Also my girlfriend's boyfriend made me go back to work today so he can spend more time with her.
