As a wannabe autist, I feel that I have come across an opportunity and wanted to share my thoughts with my fellow degenerates on a trade I'm embarking on. Feel free to shit this down. Full disclosure: if it is not obvious as your read, I am not an expert, lose with me at your own risk!\n\n**Headline:** I believe the 737 MAX crisis is being underplayed by Boeing and are about to be exposed in the market coming towards Q4 earnings on  Jan 29. \n\n**Short Background:** So everyone who reads the news (so noone on this reddit) has heard about the two 737 MAX crashes, plane groundings, etc. when it comes to Boeing. What is weird, is how well the stock of Boeing done since October 29th 2018 (1st crash ) through today. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[BA from October 2018 to today](https://preview.redd.it/uvoevd530g741.png?width=2478&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=655b08b0fc899131ff16761bdf5d62cf44c604ff)\n\n**Long Background:**\n\nAfter the first crash, the stock dropped from $360-&gt;$330 and mostly recovered within a handful of days. And really, and why shouldn't it? The MAX was a brand new plane, but pilots make mistakes and it didn't make sense to see it as a major risk to BA stock.\n\nThen on May 3rd, 2019 (2nd arrow on chart), another brand new MAX went down in the same way. I'm not an aviation expert in anyway but lightning doesn't strike the same spot twice.  The stock dropped over the next week $370-&gt;$335 and Boeing has been in this approximate channel until today. I'm not a technical trading expert so there will be no attempt to baffle you with technical bullshit here when it comes to the stock price.\n\n However, there is one major difference this time around when the 2nd crash that happened. All the MAXes were grounded. Now the stock has had movement in prices but in large part it appears the market has behaved like this is not a big deal and Boeing has sold it to be this way. You can see in the buildup and around earnings in Q2 and Q3 some huge movements due to the uncertainty around the grounding of this fleet. But Boeing was able to reassure shareholders, customers and everyone else that they would quickly resolve these issues and get the birds up in the air ASAP. \n\nMost importantly, Boeing kept production going full steam ahead saying the the MAX's would be flying again in early Q4 as late as the October 23rd at their Q3 Earnings. Yea, none of the has happened. Now again, I'm not an aviation expert, but I have been watching a lot of youtube of Boeing pilots putting their 2 cents on this. As I see it, its not that there is any one major aspect of the MAX that led to the critical failures, but a systematic approach of half ass problem solving over a long period of timing finally catching up with Boeing. The issues for these planes appears to be system errors that Boeing identified and trained their pilots to get around, instead of solving the root of the error within their systems. While getting around the issue for the trained pilot is not a problem, if sequences of these errors happen systematically, it is possible for even a trained pilot to make errors. \n\nAt this point I think it's important to bring up another key stakeholder here, the FAA. The FAA was one of the last aviating authorities to ground the MAX around the world, not the best look. In a nutshell, the FAA has been fucking cozy with Boeing, and it became very obvious after this second crash. Boeing has been pushing the FAA ever since using this too big to fail attitude which looks to be backfiring. It seems that the FAA needs to build its trust with the public and they need to show they can keep face. Coming back to the system errors, I think that fixing one small issue with the MAX is not the problem, its an attitude issue that now you cant just teach pilots work arounds, you need to solve these problems. By the way, the FAA is going to be up your ass the whole way now. \n\nAs the MAX grounding wears on, Boeing kept making 52 a month at an average cost of around 115 million a bird, piling up in inventory. Now it's over 400 birds they cannot deliver as they are not certified to fly. About a week ago, Boeing and SPR announced production will not start after the holiday break. This is going to be a major problem for Boeing, and possibly even more severe for key supplier Spirit Aerosystems SPR. The MAX is good for about 35% of all of Boeings business and about 50% for Spirit. Boeing has been hardselling the MAX's would be in the air soon, but they are not. United Airlines is calling bullshit on Boeing and not scheduling any MAX's until June 2020. \n\n**The Play:** I cannot predict how long this grounding will last but, based on all of these issues that don't line up with what management is saying, I really believe Boeing is going to have some bad news to drop at Q4 earnings and the bleeding will get worse until the news drops. If the production halt last 6 months, that is around 20% of their projected revenue for 2020 gone. Not to mention a huge amount of costs associated with getting the planes certified to fly again. They are in line for a huge hit in their cash flow and profitability in for some time. While I dont know how long this will last, I bet Boeing is in for a bad Q4, and most likely a horrible 2020 that they will not be able to spin. \n\nThis is the opportunity. This stock has been trading like management at Boeing has solved the problem. I don't believe them. It will be interesting to see what direction the new CEO will take the ship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[5 Year chart BA](https://preview.redd.it/w6mqg3eq9g741.png?width=2448&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bef9ea01c282596066c707c71dda56004f864330)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bets:** \n\n**BA**\n\n* 5 Puts at 310-1.08 entry\n* 18 Puts at 295-0.32 entry\n\nexpiring Jan 10.\n\n**SPR**\n\n* 6 Puts 72.50-1.44 entry\n\nexpiring Jan 17.\n\nYou may be asking yourself, ''Didnt this autist say BA earnings is on Jan 29th, why buy puts expiring the 10/17th??'' You would be right, I cant help myself. Like a fly is drawn to turds I love cheap FD's. I am banking on leaking news, layoffs at Boeing and SPR, and guidance before earnings throws these stocks into an uncertainty free fall outside its trading channels below 330 and possibly a lot lower. If you check the 2017 Boeing trading before MAX production, it was around $150 share. Once again, I am not a technical expert but it seems like there is a fuck load of room for these stocks to go down for the bad news on Q4 and 2020 guidance. \n\n**Risks:** There is no shortage of risks, but I am firmly in the camp that Boeing has only bad news to announce from now to earnings, this of course could be wrong. That being said, the other risk I see with Both BA and SPR are fairly close to 52 week lows while the DJ and SP 500 are at record highs which means every chump and GUH  savant is looking at these oversold stocks and buying Calls as they look cheap. Any semi-positive news will send these savants into a frenzy and put a huge fucking wrench on these risky trades. \n\n**Conclusion:** I see 3 outcomes in the next 2 weeks.   \n1. BA and SPR bottom out and trade flat/shoot up on some positive news. Either way, I'm out about 2 grand autistically believing I knew what is going on and life moves on.  \n2. They slip another 4%-8% in the next 2 weeks. If they continue bleeding coming to earnings like BA did preluding into Q3 earnings where they dropped $50 a share in a few days. This could give a nice opportunity to cash in handsomely and exchange for more puts that expire after earnings. (Which I should've originally done)  \n3. News leaks or guidance that impacts revenue, costs and profitability and Boeing and SPR cakes its pants. 10-20% drop and I can contemplate quitting my day job.  \n\n\nWill be fun to see how this puppy shapes up.", "created_utc": 1577572328, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/egxcqg/boeing_ba_spirit_aerosystems_spr_in_for_downside/", "is_self": true}
