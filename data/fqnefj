{"id": "fqnefj", "title": "Why are you still using Robinhood?", "selftext": "That platform is shit and if you\u2019re still on it then you\u2019re risking your money and losing it sometimes when they shut down. You can\u2019t even make that many trades per week or you get banned like what kind of broker does that? \u201cRobinhood doesn\u2019t charge for transactions\u201d guess what, there other brokerages that do that too. TD Ameritrade literally has no fees, they have better customer support, literally free hours upon hours of educational videos and courses, charts with useful information to use Technical Analysis, trading options with legs, about 20 short videos on different features of the app, and did I mention the customer service? You could literally chat direct or even call them and they will place trades for you (in chat it\u2019s free but if you call it isn\u2019t it\u2019s $25 if you\u2019re the type of person that likes to call). They also won\u2019t charge you on the phone if you just need help and you\u2019re not looking to place a trade. Oh and also unlimited trades, literally everything you could possibly be looking for with a brokerage account.\n\nTLDR: spy $240p 4/24\n\nEDIT: You could even YOLO more cause they let you buy options on the day of expiry\n\nEDIT 2: They also have chat rooms, paper trading (practice with fake money you start with $200K) the list goes on. I don\u2019t want to bore you so I\u2019ll stop here but there\u2019s literally no reason not to switch", "created_utc": 1585413089.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqnefj/why_are_you_still_using_robinhood/", "is_self": true}
