{"id": "fcms7o", "title": "Leveraged Wheel Theta Gang", "selftext": "So boys, update for my last post, i ended up losing most of my money on MSFT calls. Whatever 2k isn\u2019t that bad of a loss. But I think I just found a way to make pretty much free money. \nThe steps are easy:\n\n1) take out a student line of credit for let\u2019s say 5k\n\n2) use that money to either sell weekly cash covered puts or covered calls, on a good stock you wouldn\u2019t mind holding, I was thinking AMD or KO.\n\n3) use the premium to pay down the interest and principle of the loan.\n\nThis way you\u2019ll continually make profit cause even if your assigned just sell either a put/call. You can just use to the premiums to buy down the loan and by the time you\u2019ve paid off the loan, the remaining money is just free profit. Since it was never your own money.\n\nI feel like this can\u2019t go tits up. I wanna hear some opinions.", "created_utc": 1583198560, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fcms7o/leveraged_wheel_theta_gang/", "is_self": true}
