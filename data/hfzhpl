But I know you guys don't believe in technicals, but I know you all don't believe in fundamentals either, so thats that.\n\nOR maybe there is a C option? We go sideways until the US election is over? But I highly doubt it, the market will be forward-looking and start pricing in predictions before it is over. Hence, there will likely be volatility in Aug and Sept. Sept is usually bad month for stocks anyway.", "created_utc": 1593139173.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hfzhpl/which_way_is_mrmarket_going_to_go_a_or_b/", "is_self": true}
