My late valentines day gift to you comes in the form of a company that has Operating Margin of 11.6%, Net Margin of 9.2%, ROIC 12.7%, and a P/E of 15.0. All of these metrics outperform their peers and on top of this, they have a solid buyback policy. Raymond James recently upgraded and I think the only risk here will be rising beef prices. However, they have been doing a good job of reducing this impact as a result of a decrease in restaurant operating expenses as a percent of sales. EVP of Admin Operations bought 2,000 shares as of Feb 6th he knows tendies.", "created_utc": 1582176037, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6o7da/ruth_is_going_to_beat_earnings_friday/", "is_self": true}
