{"id": "gsbeb1", "title": "Zscaler & Salesforce will have strong earnings. My followers know my track record. My $.02", "selftext": "Zscaler who makes a habit of beating earnings in good times, is a small-medium ($10 B cap). They are an internet security and network connectivity company catering to enterprises moving to remote and BYOD. Every aspect of the business model was accelerated, and they already had their foot in the door of many big money $ customers as their push towards remote and compliant accelerated as a result of covid19. I expect a move similar to Splunk last week, at around 8-15% upside depending on if it\u2019s going with or against the tide of the market tomorrow. \n\nSalesforce has experienced accelerated growth in its cloud CRM and consulting services as Enterprise customers accelerated their transitions from legacy and on premise solutions in favor of Salesforce\u2019s. High margin consulting exploded on Q1 as Enterprises ramped up on boarding in Q1 ahead of Covid19. I expect a solid beat with a 5-8% move in the next few days. \n\nIt would take a substantial downward move to negate the positives moves in expecting. I\u2019m in stocks and options on both. This not advice :).", "created_utc": 1590689465.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gsbeb1/zscaler_salesforce_will_have_strong_earnings_my/", "is_self": true}
