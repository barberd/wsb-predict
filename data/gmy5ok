These headlines are misleading, as it implies US will force Chinese companies to withdraw their listings en mass, and unfortunately, this type of sensationalist reporting often impacts market sentiment.\n\nThe law would actually only add additional requirements: \n\n1) Require Chinese companies to establish they are not owned or controlled by a foreign government  \n2) Require Chinese companies to submit to an audit that can be reviewed by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board   \n3) (Potentially) Follow the U.S. GAAP Accounting standards (on top of the IFRS that they have to follow)\n\n2 Of these 3 rules are meaningless: \n\n1) How can a company establish that they are not owned or controlled by a foreign government? I seriously doubt that it will be anything more than demonstrating shareholder structure and avoiding having a \"CCP sub-committee\" attached to the Board of Directors\n\n3) Large Chinese companies, such as BABA and JD, already follow U.S. GAAP, see exhibit A: [JD's recent Quarterly Earnings presentation](http://ir.jd.com/static-files/8a05b31f-2b24-44e3-a622-94199de921e6), and a snapshot example below:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sig41480lsz41.png?width=520&format=png&auto=webp&s=9329703fe195cb414bcb0b379dc8467cd5e41253\n\nAs for the actually relevant one:\n\n2) Increased financial oversight and transparency is a welcome and far overdue, however, it will likely come with a \"currently listed companies have 3 years to comply\" or something similar. This will likely lead to some back-and-forth negotiations with the Chinese government, and will ultimately result in marginally increased financial reporting and oversight requirements for Chinese firms listing in the US. This cost may be prohibitive to smaller firms (and firms with shady accounting practices), and may lead to a large chunk of the Chinese ADRs withdrawing their listing. However, this will be a marginal/negligible cost to the big players, and will likely not impact the likes of BABA, TCEHY, BIDU, and JD.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:** Proposed rule will increase financial reporting burden on Chinese companies, which will have minimal/no impact to the large players, but will weed out the small ones / ones with shady accounting practices. \n\nWatch out for the impact to market sentiment to identify investment/shorting opportunities.", "created_utc": 1589925136.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gmy5ok/fake_news_alert_chinese_adrs_will_not_be_delisted/", "is_self": true}
