{"id": "edazey", "title": "Introducing the Official $TONKS and $BECKY Trackers, with real time updates and graphs (beta)", "selftext": "STAR AND BOOKMARK THIS GOOGLE SHEET, you should be checking this everyday the way you check Robinhood every minute. Everyone always talks about the $BECKY index and how it outperforms the S&amp;P, without any data to back it up. And now there is a new $TONKS added in the mix. It\u2019s time that r/WSB officially decides on what makes these indexes and starts tracking them religiously.\n\nI made an application that tracks $TONKS and $BECKY in real time, and as of 9:30am this morning it is operational. The index and the individual stock prices are updated every 60 seconds, and the graph is updated too. I\u2019ll maintain this and add weekly, monthly, and yearly graphs as time goes by.\n\nTo calculate the index price of $TONKS, I took the list that /u/TheGlennDavid put together. I multiplied each stock\u2019s market value by the percentage weight, and added them all together. I then divided that number by an arbitrary number to get the price down to $404.04 (The price $TSLA closed at yesterday). For $BECKY, I took 14 $BECKY stocks that people mentioned a lot and added their market caps together. I divided that by an arbitrary number to get the price of $69.00.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any feedback or if I should add/remove any stocks from the indexes or if I should calculate the indexes differents. I\u2019m autistic so idk anything about index funds other then they\u2019re boring. I can also add a $CHAD index, so lemme know what stonks belong there.\n\nThis is only the beta version. I want to officially start tracking this on January 2nd, and start the decade off right with the two hottest indexes. This gives us time to decide which stonks we want to make up the index, and how we should calculate them. Also in the future I wanna use Black-Scholes to develop options pricing for these indexes ;)\n\nPlease roast this idea and my choices of stonks, and I\u2019ll make this better. The 2020s will be the decade of WSB.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZgG5JNffElQK_UICs9V4xwd1L4N7Yumfb_Pzj-GaVF0/edit?usp=sharing", "created_utc": 1576852608, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/edazey/introducing_the_official_tonks_and_becky_trackers/", "is_self": true}
