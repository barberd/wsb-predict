{"id": "enpgek", "title": "AGTC -AAV-based gene therapy January 28th R&amp;D day", "selftext": "This company is developing AAV-based ( Adeno-associated virus ) gene therapies that focuses on two different genetic eye disorders ( *Achromatopsia*  and  *X-linked Retinitis Pigmentosa (XLRP)* ). They released 6-month data this past week on their XLRP therapy which was extremely positive and very well received by the market (stock jumped 115% on thursday). Market cap is $148million after Thursday's bump, current price = $7.84. I think this still may have room to run and a possible 2nd big jump on their R&amp;D day at the end of the month. Volume has been steadily increasing since early December with some big price jumps on surging interest. Wedbush securities (hedge fund) has been talking up this company for the past few months (target price = $12).

Their R&amp;D day is scheduled for January 28th in which they plan to release data from both AAV therapies they are developing. I think since they are doing an actual investor R&amp;D day, they may have additional data on the XLRP drug as well and are angling themselves towards developing more partnerships/collaborators in the gene space which has been on fire as of the last few months. It is very early in the process, but with all the crazy buyouts in the gene space recently it is possible that they do see some interest after their R&amp;D day. IV on february calls has been extremely high the past few days.\n\nOne of the fears of AAV-based therapies over the years has been the existence of anti-AAV antibodies that are present throughout the population and has been a major roadblock over the years for AAV-based therapies, which is part of the reason for such a low market cap. These fears have subsided a bit after the October 2019 release which shows the AAV-based drugs to still be effective in the presence of the antibodies.\n\n [https://agtc.com/agtc-presents-data-demonstrating-efficiency-of-its-aav-vectors-for-ocular-gene-therapy-even-in-the-presence-of-anti-aav-antibodies/](https://agtc.com/agtc-presents-data-demonstrating-efficiency-of-its-aav-vectors-for-ocular-gene-therapy-even-in-the-presence-of-anti-aav-antibodies/) \n\nSome helpful links:\n\nRecent data release 1/9/2020:\n\n [https://agtc.com/agtc-reports-positive-six-month-data-from-its-ongoing-phase-1-2-clinical-trial-in-x-linked-retinitis-pigmentosa/](https://agtc.com/agtc-reports-positive-six-month-data-from-its-ongoing-phase-1-2-clinical-trial-in-x-linked-retinitis-pigmentosa/) \n\nEarnings release Nov. 2019:\n\n [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/11/12/1945810/0/en/AGTC-Announces-Financial-Results-and-Business-Update-for-the-Quarter-Ended-September-30-2019.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/11/12/1945810/0/en/AGTC-Announces-Financial-Results-and-Business-Update-for-the-Quarter-Ended-September-30-2019.html) \n\nThis is obviously a very early clinical stage company which could go either way with a few bad data releases but with the recent interest from the market and some positive news from both October 2019 then this past week I think this could be set up for a pretty good run-up.", "created_utc": 1578846281, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/enpgek/agtc_aavbased_gene_therapy_january_28th_rd_day/", "is_self": true}
