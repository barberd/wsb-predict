Despite volume being 1/3 to 1/4 of what it is during regular trading hours, it moves the markets much further than it does during trading hours. During trading hours so far this week ES saw volume of 3,267,000 approximately, and a price movement of -13.75 points. Outside those hours, volume was about 945,000, BUT we saw a price movement of +114.75 points. This low volume movement leads indexes and stocks to open in the same direction as the futures, which is bad because the volume is no where near the same, and most stocks/etfs/options cannot be traded during these hours anyway. What I am showing here is not unknown, its been around for decades. The chart in this article is rather shocking, and it really makes you wonder how stocks/futures can move so much after hours under minimal volume, but never during regular trading hours. \n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/02/your-money/stock-market-after-hours-trading.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/02/your-money/stock-market-after-hours-trading.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe argument that futures are manipulated is plain as day. If all the movements happen after hours, why isnt there volume to back it up, or why doesn't the rally continue into the day? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCan you profit? by buying into futures at close, or right when they reopen at 6PM EST, you will likely be able to captures 5-10 point moves upwards. Though buying slighly OTM calls for 2-3 weeks out would likely also yield nice results, look for something with a relatively high delta in this case to profit even off of 30 point moves on ES, which is about a $3 move on SPY.", "created_utc": 1588904736.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gfklm1/are_futures_manipulated_price_movements_and/", "is_self": true}
