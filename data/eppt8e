Yesterday morning it shot up and I figured I would take a measly 450 dollar gain and call it a day. Today the same positions would be worth 6.5k. But after it shot up again today I decided to buy some puts and try to catch it on a slight fall for some profit. Well, it didn't fall and now I am holding 2.4k of SPY puts hoping that it somehow drops a dollar tommorow so I break even.", "created_utc": 1579209631, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eppt8e/rate_my_iq_on_a_scale_of_1100/", "is_self": true}
