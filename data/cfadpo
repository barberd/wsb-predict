{"id": "cfadpo", "title": "So you wanna trade spreads.", "selftext": "\u201cHey,\u201d I hear all of you college kids saying, \u201cI don\u2019t have any real capital, but I still wanna lose my $250 savings on r/WSB.\u201d\n\nWell, you can\u2019t sell puts on literally anything, you can\u2019t buy 100 of anything that matters to sell covered calls, and the only long options you can afford are FDs.  FDs are a great way to lose money, don\u2019t get me wrong, but you can do better.\n\nI\u2019m here to help you.\n\nDisclaimer, I don\u2019t know what the fuck I\u2019m talking about, but neither does anyone else here so what\u2019re you gonna do?\n\nFirst things first: why the fuck do you even care?  Spreads are cool in a couple of ways.  You know exactly what you\u2019re betting and exactly what you stand to gain.  You can trade shit that you normally wouldn\u2019t be able to touch outside of FDs.  And you can tell your friends (lmao) you have Level 3 Options, which no one gives a shit about.\n\nSound good?\n\nSecond things second: what the fuck is a spread even?  Bull put spreads and bear call spreads and whale shit spreads and what the fuck does any of that even mean?  Don\u2019t worry, I got you.\n\nA spread is just buying one option and selling another one for the same shit.  You sell $TSLA 420c and buy $TSLA 425c, you just opened up a spread.  In this case, it\u2019s a Call Credit Spread.\n\nBut let\u2019s break that shit down.\n\nIt\u2019s a call spread because you bought and sold calls.  Fucking duh.  It\u2019s a *credit* spread because the price of the lower-strike call is lower than the price of the higher-strike call.  If you sell something for $10 and you buy something for $5, you make a net *credit* of $5.\n\nYou could do it the other way: you could buy $420 calls and sell $425 calls.  Now, since you\u2019re buying something more expensive than the thing you\u2019re selling, you have a net *debit*.  You\u2019re spending money up front.  So this would be a call debit spread.\n\nSame shit with puts: you sell a put with a high strike (more $$$) and buy a put with a lower strike (less $), you make a net *credit* (put credit spread), and if you reverse that it\u2019s a put debit spread.\n\nI know you\u2019re not following so read it again.\n\nDone?  Let\u2019s move on.\n\nSo you get what it *is*, but what\u2019s the *point*?  Let\u2019s say you\u2019ve got $100 from that birthday card your grammy sent you and you wanna fuck with $MSFT going into earnings.  Fuck are you gonna do?\n\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re not an idiot and you fucking *know* it\u2019s gonna go up \u2014 but you don\u2019t know how much.  You could buy deep OTM FDs and hope it moons (fucking idiot), or you can trade a spread.  Let\u2019s say you go with the spread: you\u2019ve got two potential plays.\n\nFirst, you can do a call debit spread.  You buy a call ATM or slightly OTM, then sell another call that\u2019s slightly higher in strike \u2014 you\u2019re using the money from the sale of a contract for stocks you don\u2019t have to buy the call that you can\u2019t fucking afford.  You just have to cover the $100 *difference*.\n\nWhy would a broker let you do this?  If the price moons and the call you *sold* gets exercised, you can exercise (by which I mean \u201cyour broker will exercise\u201d) the call you *bought* to cover your ass.\n\nBut let\u2019s say that\u2019s just a bit too punk rock for you.\n\nYou have another play: you know it\u2019s gonna go up, so you sell a put.  Your broke ass can\u2019t afford to buy the shares if the shit tanks, though, so what\u2019re you gonna do?  You\u2019re gonna *buy* a put with a lower strike price (cheaper).  So, right off the bat, you make a couple bucks, and if the shit drills?  You bought another put, so you\u2019re covered if you get exercised on.\n\nBeauty about credit spreads is that you can be wrong and still make money, as long as you\u2019re not *too* wrong.\n\n$YOLO is trading at $300 going into earnings, and you wanna make a play.  You have a hundred bucks.  You think it\u2019s gonna drop because it\u2019s been *months* since $YOLO CEO called someone a pedo on Twitter, so you wanna short it.  What\u2019s your play?\n\nYou go call credit spreads.  You sell calls at $300 for fifty cents a pop, and buy calls at $301 for thirty cents a share.  $20 goes right in your pocket, and you\u2019re liable to cover exactly $100 in losses if everything goes tits up.\n\nTurns out you\u2019re a retard and instead of drilling, $YOLO goes up ten cents a share.  $300.10, boys.  Now your guy\u2019s exercising those $300 contracts you sold like \u201cgimme my ten bucks ya bitch\u201d but you\u2019re good.  Your broker buys them at $300.10, sells at $300, and you pay the ten bucks for your fuck up.\n\nYou still have ten bucks from that $20 you pocketed at the beginning.  You were *wrong* and you made money.\n\nThis is perfect for you, because you\u2019re gonna be wrong a lot.\n\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re *really* wrong, though.  $YOLO CEO calls the entire country of America a bunch of mouthbreathing titfuckers during the earnings call, and shit goes to $400.  Now instead of coming after you for ten bucks, ya boy\u2019s exercising like \u201cbut where\u2019s my ten thousand, hoe ass hoe?\u201d\n\nYou only have a hundred bucks, but you\u2019re good.  You\u2019re gonna exercise that $301 contract you *bought* like \u201cwhere\u2019s my $9900, bitch?\u201d, then you only have to pay the $100 difference.\n\nYou *still* keep your twenty bucks from the sale.\n\nNow you\u2019re a fucking expert, go lie to your broker and get level 3 options so you can lose all your money.", "created_utc": 1563556993, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cfadpo/so_you_wanna_trade_spreads/", "is_self": true}
