{"id": "b1as5u", "title": "Actual Risk Free Profit - Options Arbitrage with Example for March 15", "selftext": "Now that the memes have died I wanted to bring an actual example of risk free profit that any of us could execute tomorrow at open - if we had the cash. This play is an arbitrage play known as a reversal that takes advantage of inefficiently priced options. These exist for a multitude of reasons that are not the point of this post. \n\nThe guts of this play are as follows:\nX ATM Put Buys\nX ATM Call Sell\nStock purchase x100 per contract\n\nIf this market is efficiently priced, ATM Put Price = ATM Call Price, this play does nothing. If the market is inefficiently priced, you can pocket the difference if the premium is high enough. Let's look at a live example.\n\nCurrently priced:\nBA stock is $372.84\nBA 3/22 372.50 put is at $8.33/share\nBA 3/22 372.5 call is at $9.43/share\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BA/options?p=BA&amp;date=1553212800\n\nThe difference here is $1.10/share with a $0.34 difference from stock price. This means we can execute this arbitrage strategy with a decent profit. It is important to note here that there will almost always be profit potential but the gains will generally be below bond interest return (thanks HFT). \n\nThe upfront cost of this play is $37,824 per 100 shares with a profit of $76 per contract pair. This is a return on investement of 0.2%. \n\nNow if you were blessed or provided with a disability you will be mentally flaming me right now. Let me show you why you have autism.\n\nThis is a profit of 0.2% over a **7 day investement period.** Anyone who has graduated middle school and has at least one free brain cell can then do the following calculation for *APY*:\n\n((1.002)^(365/7))-1 =11%\n\nThis means with this play or similar (and they exist just as this one does right now) executed weekly you can get a garunteed 11% ROI annually. \n\nIf you aren't a gambling addict this should impress you. I would execute this play but I don't have 37k liquid. Keeping your eyes out for these on lower cost stocks can yield similar % with less capital lockup. \n\nPeace\n\n", "created_utc": 1552626606, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b1as5u/actual_risk_free_profit_options_arbitrage_with/", "is_self": true}
