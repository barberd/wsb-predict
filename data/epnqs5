{"id": "epnqs5", "title": "(Paper Money) Keep Helping me Moon!", "selftext": "In true WSB fashion, this sub is providing me a first-rate education in trading with options. I am still very new to trading options, but one thing I've learned from my time here is to always do the opposite of this sub. I saw all the hype around TSLA a few days ago and everyone mentioning they were going in long with calls, so being the broke joke that I am, I pulled out the ol' TDA paper money account to see if I could figure out how options actually work. Well, not sure if I learned anything technical regarding options, but I choose a few random puts a few months out and let the magic happen for a nice $25.5k gain. So the lesson about going in contrary to WSB seems to actually hold some water.\n\nKeep up the work WSB! If I can continue to make some (faux) gains by doing the opposite of this sub, I may actually have a chance of earning some real tendies one day!", "created_utc": 1579201008, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/epnqs5/paper_money_keep_helping_me_moon/", "is_self": true}
