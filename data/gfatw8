Time to close down Pornhub, shut off the Roe Jogan podcast with our favorite degenerate Elon Tusk and time to crack open a White monster. So scratch your coronavirus neckbeard and get to work. This could possibly be the most important 3 strategies you will ever see and or use in your short miserable life. NOTE: This is solely for my fellow tards and if anyone of you shares this with your truck stop docking bull friends instant perma ban #MODMEFGT. Enough with the build-up dude and let's get down to it.\n\nI employ 3 main strategies that literally can't go tits up. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1) Dr. Dartboard. I have a recent graduate of the Powell Printer Academy. He sits opposite of my toilet. Every time I go to the bathroom I throw a dart. Where it lands is what stonk is going to be crap that day.\n\n2) Inverse the fucking inverse. So everyone and their grandma's boyfriend thinks to inverse WSB plays. Well, I'm big brain and I inverse their inverse. Work's 60% of the time - every time. \n\n3) I run a very lucrative ring of beta fish fighting. Each opponent names their fish with their favorite ticker and the clock starts. When the winner has been crowned KING FD of STONK CITY, the time is noted. That becomes the strike price and expiration date.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't want to bore you with any of the fundamentals or technical anal-ysis because I'm sure you stopped reading after you couldn't close down pornhub. Anyways my girlfriend's boyfriend needs me to get him a beer and make him a sandwich. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks,\n\nCEO of Stonk World LLC", "created_utc": 1588872014.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gfatw8/the_only_3_strategies_proven_to_work/", "is_self": true}
