Everyone's emotional and everyone is prone to mistakes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: didn't include names due to privacy but can definitely do that next time if it's allowed", "created_utc": 1584999706.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fnsm6z/peoples_dd_vs_reality_over_the_past_month/", "is_self": true}
