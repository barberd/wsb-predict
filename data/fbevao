{"id": "fbevao", "title": "DD inside: States and local governments are going to save a lot of money on pensions that have been driving them to bankruptcy after boomers die en-masse due to corona.", "selftext": "States like Illinois have billions of dollars in debt due to pensions deals with boomers. Many of those deals have been adjusted for future generations but boomers still collect on the gravy train deals from the 60s and 70s. Once corona kills many of them off, states will have a lot more money for infrastructure deals, get lower rates due to better credit ratings. So municipal funds are a good buy now, you get tax free money in dividends and you're going to see a bump in price after investors see the high rates collected are as good as it gets and pile in before the lower rates get in. \n\nI like DTF because...duh, FMN and any other municipal based funds that lend to pension obligated municipalities. More of a long term play that a quick bet, but if you guys see any of these funds with options, go for leaps.", "created_utc": 1582993483, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fbevao/dd_inside_states_and_local_governments_are_going/", "is_self": true}
