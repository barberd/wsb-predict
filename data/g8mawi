{"id": "g8mawi", "title": "Blue Apron ahead of earnings.", "selftext": "Let's be real - The post-Covid19 era will have an economy shaped by new habits & regulations based on reduced close-contact interaction. The current disruption will change how we eat, work, shop, exercise, manage our health, socialize, and spend our free time - at an unprecedented rate of change.\n\nRestaurant's are already planning on introducing robotic waiters to reduce the transmission of the germs since they don't see a vaccine being developed within the next 12 months. \n\nContact free deliveries will be huge for the next 1 to 3 years and this trend will likely outlast the virus.\n\nAmazon is already seeing a crazy surge but let's be real, they are a trillion dollar company. It might take a lot more to see that thing move. But APRN is only 147 million dollars and it has another chance to grow thanks to Covid 19. \n\nHere's my case:\n\nRestaurant visits have dropped next to zero.\n\nNo one wants to go to grocery stores for fear or exposure; in 2019 the total grocery sales in America was close to 700 billion.\n\nThe average American spends roughly 2 to 5k eating out per year.\n\nIn 2019, restaurant sales amounted to 900 billion dollars.\n\nIf Blue APRN can capture .001 percent of that \u201cdining out\u201d revenue then their quarterly revenue will jump 1,000 percent. This doesn't even include the rev stolen from grocery stores. We know people 65 and older are fearing for their life and will be very willing to order meal kits rather than stepping foot in grocery stores which are germ factories.\n\nLastly, fuck Hello Fresh. We ordered that shit and the meal wasn't as good, took longer to make, and we had to supply 20 percent of the ingredients.\n\nEdit:\n\nTLDR: Thanks to the covid 19 this beaten down stock has another shot at growth. If gathering restrictions remain in place for another 6 to 18 months, expect this stock to surge 100 to 300 percent within the next 12 months.", "created_utc": 1587934642.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g8mawi/blue_apron_ahead_of_earnings/", "is_self": true}
