{"id": "hc1u4s", "title": "HVAC Stocks: The Next Bubble", "selftext": "Recently there has been rising Coronavirus cases in the US in very hot climates, Arizona being the prime example. Why is this happening? Part of it is because in very hot climates, people are more often indoors than outdoors, and we\u2019ve seen statistically that being outdoors is much safer for stopping the spread of Coronavirus than indoors. But it may also have to do with people blasting AC and poor ventilation as Nate Silver suggests in this tweet.\n\n[https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1273329472524222466](https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1273329472524222466)\n\nIt seems very possible to me that the AC/ventilation in very hot states is not good enough to stop the spread of Coronavirus and that many businesses will need to upgrade or rework their HVAC systems. Many businesses have already suggested they will do so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ywtvy3dtov551.png?width=630&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbfd94684ecedb74b9e076d9fcd2ff2f136e913c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/92nz808rov551.png?width=1836&format=png&auto=webp&s=182264659ae792e9a96499d3b7c6d66feaef9227\n\nSo what HVAC companies should you buy? There are two I think make the most sense. One is Carrier (CARR), which is a stock people on WSB seem to like. Carrier wrote a whitepaper in May explaining how HVAC companies can help slow the spread of Coronavirus. \n\n[https://www.shareddocs.com/hvac/docs/1001/Public/02/COVID-19-WHITE-PAPER.pdf](https://www.shareddocs.com/hvac/docs/1001/Public/02/COVID-19-WHITE-PAPER.pdf)\n\nCarrier has also launched a program called the Healthy Building Initiative. The company clearly sees Coronavirus as an opportunity and that fact makes them seem like the best buy here. Trane Technologies (TT) is also a commercial HVAC company and seems like a better by than Lennox (LII) that does more residential sales. I think Johnson Controls (JCI) is also a solid buy.\n\nCARR July 17 22C", "created_utc": 1592577521.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hc1u4s/hvac_stocks_the_next_bubble/", "is_self": true}
