SERIOUS POST", "selftext": "First, I want to state that obviously if you're managing a multi-million mutual fund the amount of capital you have readily available (and could readily put into a given stock) would manipulate smaller stocks to the point where you can't make crazy gains in short periods of times.\n\nBut for average people surely 7% is extremely poor in a bull market. \n\nLet's take a guy that only invests 30k into the market. If he only does common sense swing trades, surely he can easily make 20-30% in a year even by the most conservative standards?\n\nA month ago I put 2k into an account and within a month I have an 120% gain. This was through a mix of day trading and swing trading, and I realize that I am extremely lucky and the exception, but at the same time I can't help but to think that any person with 30k can diversify in high growth tech stocks (such as V) and simply sell the first day the stock posts something like a 5% loss (which would obviously be highly irregular for V). I don't see a way that V could simply drop 30% in value barring a major scandal. \n\nWhat is stopping average/poor traders from putting large amounts of money into multiple stocks with charts like V (practically bulletproof metrics)? Of course you're supposed to do your due diligence and read financial reports but any normal person can look at V's charts and realize that's a good investment. Combine that with 15-20 stocks with similar metrics and you mean to tell me that 7% is a good return?\n\nSomebody tell me I'm ignorant", "created_utc": 1568337198, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d3hp0n/somebody_please_help_me_understand_why_7_annually/", "is_self": true}
