{"id": "cnsx62", "title": "TVIX", "selftext": "Okay so I've never done much with VIX other than watch it, but with latest round of tariffs I bought TVIX at about 20 and sold for 26. I notice in stable times it goes down to about 13-15. Seems to me it would always be a buy at that range because there will be the inevitable tweet, tariff, or Powell comment to make it spike by 50% or more. Returns should always be much more than chasing some safe haven like gold.\n\nI realize buying it isn't really investing in anything, not a company or commodity. Is there any danger to holding shares in this for awhile until the inevitable volatility or collapse happens?", "created_utc": 1565302278, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cnsx62/tvix/", "is_self": true}
