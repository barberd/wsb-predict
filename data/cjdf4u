{"id": "cjdf4u", "title": "BYND- I took some money off the table", "selftext": "Hi guys,\n\nI promised I would update when I took some money off the table and here we are. I rolled over most of it into Aug $300 calls. But I sold the rest of my calls so at least I have a pretty nice profit if this thing goes south after earnings. Obviously I am still rooting for a beat and a short squeeze, since I hold $300 calls, but I don't want to become a cautionary tale on this sub. \n\nShort interest still high at 43% or so and borrow rate still in the 140% range. \n\nGood luck to everyone. \n\nMike", "created_utc": 1564417039, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cjdf4u/bynd_i_took_some_money_off_the_table/", "is_self": true}
