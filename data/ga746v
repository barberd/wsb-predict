I\u2019ve been watching this chart for a while and every single indication I have from the charts says it\u2019s tanking over the next 3 days. \n\n[week long chart](https://imgur.com/lVjg9h7) shows pretty heavy bear signals. \n\n[month long chart](https://imgur.com/YCQRwI4) shows even harder bear signals. We\u2019re seeing the beginnings of what looks like a classic batman formation. High followed by smaller high and a rally lesser than original high. \n\n[3 month long chart](https://imgur.com/60r3iLH) shows even harder signs. We can see the classic batman formation played out nearly identically to what\u2019s happening now just a few weeks back. \n\nDaily charts have shown massive pushback at $6 and it\u2019s been unable to break that number long enough to show up on anything other than minute charts. And today it\u2019s proved it isn\u2019t willing to push highs that were already established days passed.\n\nAssuming I\u2019m 3 for 3 and right on it falling, what should the plays be? I\u2019m rolling with 5/1 $6p, but you could still buy $5.50p and you\u2019d most likely be in the money. \n\nAs for when to sell in case you want to take profits and run, I\u2019d sell exactly at $4.60. Any further and it\u2019s uncharted territory. The rally for the past 2 weeks was simply because Michael fucking Burry (yes the one and only) bought 5% of the company and you autists decided to follow and pump it up. I imagine the price could drop much further than $4.60, but it\u2019s shown support at $4.70ish and who know what\u2019ll happen after it hits that. If you want to keep bag holding, I\u2019d consider selling again at the pre-Burry average of around $4.10. I really don\u2019t think it\u2019ll drop much further. \n\nPositions:\nYolo on GME 5/1 $6p\nGME 5/1 $5.5p", "created_utc": 1588156751.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ga746v/gme_tanking_the_next_3_days/", "is_self": true}
