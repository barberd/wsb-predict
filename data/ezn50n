Maybe even some veterans don\u2019t understand how to avoid PDT.\n\nSo you enter into an options trade and things aren\u2019t going your way after an hour or two. You want out of the trade? \n\nOr even better, you got a 5-bagger and you\u2019re scared things will change overnight.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to sell the options and take the day trade. \n\nYou need to realize that the contract itself is collateral.\n\nWhen I say collateral I mean you can sell options for the same expiry date on the same stock with no money coming out of your account... you actually get money credited to your account. Just don\u2019t consult Ironyman on that aspect.\n\nWith that collateral you have unknowingly owned you are able to sell contracts for the same expiry date.\n\nFor calls you have to sell a strike above you, for puts you have to sell a strike below yours.\n\nSo if you want to lock in profit on that SPY 333C you can sell any strike above that with the same expiration date to lock in profit. You\u2019ll be credited with the sell. You can buy them back next day or let them run to expiry.\n\nThis message was brought to you by the nephew of Jay Powell, we need your money in the market.", "created_utc": 1580965048, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ezn50n/how_to_avoid_getting_pdt_banned_from_options/", "is_self": true}
