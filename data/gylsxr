I was a stubborn bear for a few months as you can see, depositing more money in (a total of another $10k) and buying puts until I only had $3k left. \n\nBull me:\nI gave in, bought leaps with the 3k left hoping to recover a little and stop being consumed by options. It doubled in 2 days, so naturally I was back and threw 6k into MGM. Turned that into about ~18k (partial order: [mgm gains](https://imgur.com/gallery/coPdY71). Made it up to 25k, lost 15k day trading. Back into MGM to turn 9k into 25k, and day trades up to 35k. \n\nMore like a U shape I guess, but anyways: [v shape](https://imgur.com/gallery/y21seGx)\n\nWill I ever learn or stop? Probably not.
