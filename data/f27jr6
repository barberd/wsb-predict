After earnings TSLA had IV crunch, options for 50% OTM expiring in a month were only 50 cents a share. I decided to play SPY instead of going in on that only to see them rise to $126 a share 2 days later.\n\nThe same options are like $12 a share right now. If all you autists can stop pumping TSLA for like 5 days we can load up on 50% OTM calls expiring in a month for super cheap. Could even do puts too they're so cheap (but only like 5 cuz stonks only go up)\n\nTSLA will moon again on the next pump and we dump for massive gains.", "created_utc": 1581423551, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f27jr6/stop_pumping_tsla_for_a_couple_days_and_tendies/", "is_self": true}
