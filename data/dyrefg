{"id": "dyrefg", "title": "Bio Pharma Companies", "selftext": "Ok so two stocks popped off yesterday, props to whoever invested but I'm just watching on the sidelines with my jaw dropped at how this happened. \n\nKaruna Therapeutics (KRTX) and Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma (MTZPY) both passed phase 2 clinical trials yesterday. Mitsubishi is up around 50% the past two days. Karuna is up 630% \n\nWhat the actual fuck, why does this Karuna keep growing? I saw GS gave it a 109 price target and they are working on a secondary offering, but I had no idea Schizophrenia meds would be such a big investment.  It just baffles me that it's up another 30% today after its 400% rally yesterday. I felt like it wouldn't keep growing today after yesterday. This doesn't make sense to me. Anyone else following this? This wouldn't be a pump and dump would it? Too bad no one is selling options though.", "created_utc": 1574199966, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dyrefg/bio_pharma_companies/", "is_self": true}
