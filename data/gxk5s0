We will truly never know what it\u2019s like to be American yet we piggy back off all your major accomplishments in the markets. You drive the North American economy and we are grateful for your protection and everything else you do and stand for. From Canada with love \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6 \u2764\ufe0f \n\nI have started donating money I\u2019m making from your stock market back into the areas that I believe need it within the United States. Not that I think that they need it the most because I will never know at any given time who needs it the most. I just really believe that the kids will change the world and if I can start spreading the love then maybe other Canadians will follow suit. I appreciate my fellow brothers and sisters of the United States and everyone else in-between. \n\n\nThank you for your investment in the Ed Fund\u2019s mission.  We are grateful for your recent donation of $25.54 to the COVID-19 Support for Oakland Students & Schools fund held at the Oakland Public Education Fund. Your generosity is critical in helping fulfill our mission of strengthening teaching and accelerating learning so that every student can learn, grow, and thrive.\n\nWe are grateful to you for providing the resources our students so richly need and deserve to ensure that their education is vibrant and helps them reach their aspirations.\n\nTo make an even bigger impact, please consider spreading the word about the Ed Fund\u2019s work and share your support on social media.\n\nThank you for all that you do to help make our educational system work for our students. \n\nIn partnership,\nThe Oakland Public Education Fund\nDONATION RECEIPT\nDate\nDonation ID\nAmount\nFund\n5/17/2020", "created_utc": 1591416933.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gxk5s0/thank_you_from/", "is_self": true}
