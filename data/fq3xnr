If you're in a position where you got puts more than 2 weeks out, stop bitching with you're little baby dick in your hands and grow a real monster dong and swing that thing with pride. You might be down now but don't forget that hospitals ARE on the brink of being overwhelmed. Also nurses in places outside of California and New York are saying they are seeing people that are confirmed COVID19 cases but they're barely getting any PPE while dealing with them. This will still get worse so HOLD those puts. Remember, Donny said we'll be open by Easter (that's 4/12 retards). You really think that's going to happen?\n\nP.S. To all you bulls, good luck with your gains right now but don't get greedy. Shit will not stay like this for much longer.", "created_utc": 1585337786.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fq3xnr/god_damnithold/", "is_self": true}
