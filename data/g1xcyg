I saw what happened to JPM stock with their earnings miss and provisions for credit loss. I believed the same would happen to GS. I lost my entire 56k portfolio this past month. I have 5 dollars in my account. I woke up at 615am today to look at GS earnings report. I placed my 170p 15 minutes later with my stimulus money. About $940 dollars worth instant deposit on Robinhood. It\u2019s... its just climbing. This shouldn\u2019t happen, it\u2019s not supposed. I am done with options trading.
