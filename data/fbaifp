It took a fucking month for the market to react to the BeerVirus, and you morons think it's gonna end because the market went down 3 days?\n\nHad we started on a market that reflected the true value of companies, sure, a bounce would be more than likely. But that wasn't the case. Truth is, we were on an overpriced AF market (\\*cough\\* TSLA 1k \\*cough\\*), which didn't really reflect value, but rather the **expectations** people had for the companies. \n\nTaking that into account, and knowing that we've been on the **longest bullish period in history,** a recession is probably coming soon. So why tf has this recession not come earlier? The explanation is simple, Big Dong Trump. With the US presidency elections coming up at the end of the year, the D can't afford to let the market receide just yet, so it's squeezing the Fed's balls so that they don't increase the rates to keep the market growing. Everything was going according to plan and people were getting big bull tendies even amidst the possibility of a pandemic that was fucking China (a country that represents 16% of the world's economy) up. \n\n**But that all changed when the Corona Nation attacked.** Corona reached EU, and even though half americans have no fucking clue where Spain or Italy are, it sounds closer than China, so, PANICC.\n\nAs of now, only China's production has been halted, and I highly doubt we have seen the full consequences on the economy just yet, but it's probably not the only one that's gonna suffer.\n\nThere are still countries who haven't experienced any cases, so we should expect a surge of infections this weekend. The virus has entered some countries which literally can't/won't do shit against it (SA) and has yet to enter other big countries with little to no hygiene/control.\n\nI highly doubt it happens in less massified countries, but there are 3 scenarios right now:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Country X halts production -&gt; **bulls are fucked**\n* Country X doesn't halt production, so 2 things can happen now:\n   * Option 1, cases are controlled and don't spread as rapidly as initially thought -&gt; **bears are fucked**\n   * Option 2, cases spread rapidly so now the country has 2 choices:\n      * Choice 1, halt production -&gt; **bulls are fucked**\n      * Choice 2, not stopping production, which would make cases spread faster, making their sanitary system susceptible to a colapse -&gt; **bulls are fucked**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSouth Korea is following China's steps, and will more than likely halt it's production soon (almost 900 cases in a day), which won't impact the economy as much but it's probably gonna have an effect, mostly because Japan will tank too. EU is still gonna see a rise in virus cases this weekend, and given that the virus presents no symptoms the first 2/3 weeks (plenty of time for people to travel and spread it) it's only a matter of time till the virus reaches pretty much every country. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis doesn't mean the recession is coming just yet, I don't think so, but I do recommend you call your gf's boyfriend and go shopping for a nice strap on. The Gay Reign period is about to come.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nACTUAL DISCLAIMER: While it's obvious that most markets will tank, the US marketS are retarded enough to see a bounce next week. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL:DR - BUY PUTS**", "created_utc": 1582970667, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fbaifp/buythedip/", "is_self": true}
