He\u2019s got an army of 1M RH degenerates of which have bled into this forum already and literally every stock that came out of his greasy lips has mooned. Every single one. \nAnyway, I don\u2019t know how to be part of his DDGT Global Klan but I\u2019ll ride his call out. Makes sense. People are loading up, guns are flying off shelves like toilet paper, and SWBI is going to report on June 18th.
