{"id": "ccz526", "title": "TSLA short squeeze", "selftext": "As of 6/28, short sellers haven\u2019t even started to cover their positions.  They maintained their record high $10.1 BILLION bet against Tesla. This represents 31% of float.\n\nThis tells me the recent share price rally is driven by bulls accumulating rather than shorts covering.  \n\nPick your catalyst - there are so many.  Volume production and strong demand in China.  Pickup reveal.  European gigafactory announcement. Once shorts start covering, it\u2019s going to move fast. \n\nHow much money they lose this quarter doesn\u2019t matter.  They are a growth company revolutionizing an industry for Christ\u2019s sake.  The fact that media / bears have turned to focus on profitability is telling that they are out of ammunition. \n\nI\u2019m expecting $300-$330 by EOY.  I\u2019m long 500 shares, which is 21% of my net worth.  Options could work if you time it right, but they\u2019re mighty expensive.", "created_utc": 1563079988, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ccz526/tsla_short_squeeze/", "is_self": true}
