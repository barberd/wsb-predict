He wants to do it now, but is being required to wait by his advisors. It's pretty much a fact that is if its legalized, his approval ratings will soar (if he takes sole credit.) If you doubt this theory, do your DD, and you will see the writing on the wall. I recieved this info from a friend of a friend of a aide in the White House, and researched it myself. The shoo in for AG is a shoo in, because Trump knows he wont impede Trump's ketamine legalization plan. Also depression rates will plummet because of Ketamine. So theres not gonna be one in 2020 like y'all predict.", "created_utc": 1562270858, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c972fj/ketamine_stocks_will_soar_at_election_time/", "is_self": true}
