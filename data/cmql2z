Timed this change of direction within an hour or 2 of peak.\n\n3) JPM double / triple / whatever top at $117 buying $116 puts.\n\n4) MCD puts after earnings pop buying puts around $217/share.\n\n5) Heavy bet on V $180 puts on July 29th in the afternoon but selling on July 30th at the open for break-even. V went on to tank to $176/share the afternoon of July 31st (iirc the puts hit $3 or $4/contract which would have turned my 1k bet into 12k). \n\n6) Literally hours before Trump tweets buying DIA $270 puts. Buy on Thursday (day of tweet) 10:30am at $0.89. Sell on Thursday when I see I am up at $2.02 at 1:37pm (they went on to hit $7.50 the following day). \n\nI should have at least 15k in my account that I initially funded with $2600 only 1 month ago. So, what do I have? $750 and I'm all-in on AAPL $200 calls (buy yesterday $2 they closed around $0.80 lol). \n\nEvery single trade I made was put options until the brilliant idea of putting a bunch of money on QQQ/FB calls on Friday. I think I was irritated that I didn't hold my puts that iirc would have turned $500 into $4500. \n\nSo I'll just hold my AAPL calls until expiration as they will hit at least $205 this week and my $750 will be worth at least $3000 again. Apple around $196 pre-market I might be in-the-money by today's close? If it goes up 4% today that is a $201.xx close which is highly probable. \n\nMy brain even said yesterday knowing I was fvcked that what I needed to do was buy SPY $284 puts at the open for yesterday's expiration (it was around $288 pre-market iirc). Sure enough had I done what I knew had to be done I would have potentially made 500-1500%. SPY bottomed at $281.8 and closed below $284 making this another flawless options pick. I loaded up the screen but didn't have the balls to execute this trade. \n\nAll good Apple will go up all day long today at least +4% = $201/share = ITM calls = .86 calls worth around $4 (?) = account value from $750 to $3500.", "created_utc": 1565098096, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cmql2z/is_there_a_term_for_making_several_flawless/", "is_self": true}
