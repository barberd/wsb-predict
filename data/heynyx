{"id": "heynyx", "title": "Poorly Executed SPY Short", "selftext": "I had opened a same day $310, $311 put spread that expired Monday. The market rallied into the close on AAPL strength (more than anticipated, I'd say), taking me from max gain to a small loss. Even though the market continued rallying after-hours, I decided not to call the broker to tell them to not exercise the $311 leg. I was prepared to go short... or so I thought.\n\nMonday night, we had that trade deal head-fake where I thought I'd wake up to fresh tendies in the morning, but saw the correction a few hours later. Instead we opened gapped up and I realized two things: 1) I just killed a nice win streak riding the market up over the past 8 days, and 2) the SPY short was $800k (that's a huge figure to most of us including me) which instantly put me into a margin call  limiting me from opening any new trades.\n\nMargin calls are tricky as it varies in terms of just how much time you have before you're forced to close the position or the broker does it for you. Given that the market gapped higher than I expected, I went into risk management mode fearing they might force a cover of the short at a loss, and started selling puts against the short to offset the spike. Those positions were in by 10 AM and I went to focus on the regular day job.\n\nFast forward to the last hour yesterday, the puts I sold were in the green and I was tempted to close out a few contracts to reload tomorrow, but of course, I didn't. The market tanked in the final hour and as of this morning, looks like I had made the right call on going short, but fucked up the execution and should have just called the broker to get an idea of how much time I'd have so I wouldn't have sold all those puts against the short as quickly as I did.\n\nCOB Tuesday-- position down $7k: [https://preview.redd.it/7sxe5j79xt651.png?width=1642&format=png&auto=webp&s=6134739c43756a6f60aecd1d7a45e1ebca873b4a](https://preview.redd.it/7sxe5j79xt651.png?width=1642&format=png&auto=webp&s=6134739c43756a6f60aecd1d7a45e1ebca873b4a)\n\ntldr; opened $800k short on SPY the day before AAPL and MSFT hit new 52 wk highs, then sold puts against the position when I should have just waited a day.", "created_utc": 1592994486.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/heynyx/poorly_executed_spy_short/", "is_self": true}
