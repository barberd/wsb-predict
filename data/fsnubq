Here is a similar issue that I was able to screenshot from the following day: \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/Q2JsU6G\n\n(These are the same photos I attached to the legal team) \n\nAlso you can see that there were serious outages earlier in the day when I had other less time sensitive positions and if you look at their twitter feed there were some serious outages from the previous week too.\n\nNot sure how to prove this but here is a screenshot of me messaging my friends on whatsapp with timestamps when it happened:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/6OEocD8\n\n\nThis isn't a one time issue and even if Questrade wants to make it seem like I am 100% responsible for these losses, even though their trade desk analyst said \"I did not see the technical issues as being that much of a factor in terms of losses\" implying there were still \"**a**\" factor I think its important for people to know they can't really use Questrade for active trading regardless. \n\nIf the screenshots aren't working and you want to read a text transcript of the emails I will put them in the comments and put the links here momentarily. \n\nQuestrade Legal: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fsnubq/contacted_by_questrade_legal_team_for_permission/fm2gkzu/)\n\nMy response: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fsnubq/contacted_by_questrade_legal_team_for_permission/fm2gpvd/)\n\nThanks.\n\n\nEdit: Seems like some of you guys are missing the point. Ignore my trades for a moment. Ignore the fact that before 11am I still had around 50k of a triple leveraged ETF and weekly options in my account I couldn't access.\n\nA broker went down for hours at a time. \n\nMultiple days during an extremely volatile trading period.\n\nThey had issues with deposits and issued margin calls for their own error. \n\nThey were unable to process market orders for over an hour.\n\nThey are allowing people to deposit money into their accounts while the account is not verified so the person is unable to trade. \n\nDo you not see how these are issues in itself. I still was unable to access a large volatile position for hours at a time... \n\nI'm not blaming them solely for the loss. It wasn't a good trade but my point is I should be able to access any and every position at all times.", "created_utc": 1585696997.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fsnubq/contacted_by_questrade_legal_team_for_permission/", "is_self": true}
