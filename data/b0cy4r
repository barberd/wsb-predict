{"id": "b0cy4r", "title": "MDB ER, AWS, &amp; ESTC", "selftext": "Disclosure: I'm not a software engineer &amp; am literally dumb as dirt.\n\nESTC sold off today as much as 5% on news that AWS is going to fork ESTC, just like they did with MDB. MDB sold off on the news and is up 40% since. ESTC is almost 20% off its ATH. Additionally these companies would be related if they could be. Virtually same market cap, revenues, growth rate, etc.\n\nAs a non-dev my question is will this effect MDBs business, will they lose customers? My gut says no, but i'm a sperg so that means yes. It seems like it would be nice to have AWS as an all in one solution for devs but it seems like devs require the intricacies of smaller indie cloud software to really run their programs at scale. (?)\n\nAs both a MDB &amp; ESTC \"investor,\" tomorrow's ER from MDB will be telling for an idiot like me. Will there be any comments on the fork at all? Will it effect guidance??\n\nI bought a couple ESTC 85c 3.15 at open to trade because I want to see what MDB says about AWS' fork of their product. I'm looking to buy some fall ESTC 85c (and a bit more OTM) as well as some April &amp; May calls as the price still hovers down at this level. Is anyone bullish on calls into MDB ER?? Big premium, would need big beat and raise.\n\nAny thoughts from people trading this or devs who use these companies services? Interested in hearing the difference between AWS &amp; MDB/how devs like to use each. ", "created_utc": 1552424036, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b0cy4r/mdb_er_aws_estc/", "is_self": true}
