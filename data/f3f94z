It\u2019s full of extremely helpful, knowledgeable and wealthy traders. Because of them, I have an in depth understanding about stonks and how they only go up. \n\nThis past year has brought me tons of laughs, rage, and most importantly, huge losses. Like most WSBers, I chucked hundreds into way OTM options during earnings. I\u2019ve won some... lost most, but it\u2019s been a hell of a ride. As a result, my personal risk tolerance has turned into infinity and I will keep throwing money into options until I hit that big one! \n\nHappy birthday to me! Cheers to another year of gambling! \n\nPS: MSFT 200c 3/20.", "created_utc": 1581621745, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3f94z/its_my_cake_day_what_did_you_guys_get_me/", "is_self": true}
