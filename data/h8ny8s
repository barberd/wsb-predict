{"id": "h8ny8s", "title": "PG&E: Monopolies Make You Tendies", "selftext": "Okay, okay, I know what y'all are going to say. You got burned on this one before, but I think that's because y'all timed how to buy this VERY wrong.\n\nA little background: my last picks were Activision, New Relic, and Box before earnings. All returned bigly (at least 200%+ on each one). I think PG&E is my biggest trade that will come to date, and I ask you to do a lot of research on this one before investing; there's just too much news to encapsulate it all in one DD. This is a value (Buffet) play with an autistic spin because we are fucking with calls here.\n\nThis one is a pretty simple play; the State of California will not let PG&E go bankrupt because they are a monopoly, and it's simply not that easy to get rid of a utility company that has monopolized the region. Regulators have already approved the deal ([https://www.naturalgasintel.com/articles/122140-pge-bankruptcy-plan-okd-by-california-regulators-now-awaiting-court-approval](https://www.naturalgasintel.com/articles/122140-pge-bankruptcy-plan-okd-by-california-regulators-now-awaiting-court-approval)), and all that is left is for the judge to approve it as well, which is very likely for the reasons stated. Also, an important thing to note is that the judge has helped PG&E navigate bankruptcy before in 2001: [https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/07/us/california-s-largest-utility-files-for-bankruptcy.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/07/us/california-s-largest-utility-files-for-bankruptcy.html).\n\nThis time especially looks promising for PG&E to exit Chapter 11 because the main focus is for victims to get compensated which mostly will be in the form of stonks. If PG&E goes bankrupt, the victims really do not get left with much; thus, 88% have voted for them to exit bankruptcy. Judge Montali has said on numerous occasions that he will likely side with what the victims want, and California regulators have already approved the plan and Newsom has as well. Last time the plan was approved by regulators the stock jumped 56%, and there's currently a lot of bullish activity going on among institutional investors which you can see in dark pool volume and the new investments lead by Dan Loeb and debt financing by JP Morgan.\n\nYou should not be worried about dilution as the stock is undervalued so much that buying at current prices will still give hefty returns. I can see a rally happening anywhere from $15-21 (the broader market can have a huge effect in my opinion). Judge Montali has on his calendar that he has a PG&E hearing on Tuesday which I suspect will be decision day, and he has indicated that next week will be the week when he releases a decision. In addition, PG&E is borrowing money from the California Wildfire Relief Fund to fund their bankruptcy, and they have until June 30 deadline to exit bankruptcy to get their hands on the money they need from the state. If you want to stay extra safe, buy calls past June.", "created_utc": 1592112410.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h8ny8s/pge_monopolies_make_you_tendies/", "is_self": true}
