{"id": "fqdy37", "title": "COVID-19 Best/Worse Case Scenarios (US)", "selftext": "A lot of you are asking me about the best/worse-case scenarios of human loss and general timelines of things getting back to normal in the US.\n\nI\u2019ve run hundreds of simulations and crunched some numbers to answer that $64T question. Here are my findings:\n\n**SCENARIO #1: WHERE WE ARE NOW**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ej1hevqekcp41.png?width=1863&format=png&auto=webp&s=95a9ce0dfe2fdfaccd4fad22775c3fa06ea90934\n\nThe total amount of infectious people will peak at the end of May with 18M. The total amount of deaths reaching almost 2.6M(!) by Aug. This is a very grim and devastating outcome, by any standards. If nothing changes, this is very possible.\n\n**SCENARIO #2: WHERE WE CAN BE**\n\nIf the government implements an unprecedented total national lockdown and a slew of other war-like measures shortly, the outcome is somewhat better:\n\n[  ](https://preview.redd.it/lui3r53lkcp41.png?width=1862&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e55151707cfe749a401c65453720cd77953f19d)\n\nThe total amount of infectious people will peak at the end of June with about 6M. The total amount of deaths reaching still an unbelievable 1.5M by Sep. This is still a horrendous scenario and we don\u2019t even have proper measures in place for this to occur.\n\n**SCENARIO #3: WHERE WE COULD HAVE BEEN**\n\nI believe if we have had implemented very strong measures by the beginning of this month, we could\u2019ve seen a completely different picture:\n\n[  ](https://preview.redd.it/66hh61wpkcp41.png?width=1866&format=png&auto=webp&s=3390326d286084deb9888c1478fb96aa49454ffd)\n\nThe total amount of infectious people would have peaked by mid-Apr with only 121K cases. The total amount of deaths would have \u201conly\u201d been around 37K by Sep. I don\u2019t believe this is scenario is possible anymore.\n\nUnfortunately, the amount of deaths will keep increasing for a while, even after the infectious curve is flatten due to inertia. My sincere hope that we fall somewhere between scenario #2 & #3. For that to happen a full national lockdown must be in place within 1 week, with additional measures to follow.\n\nTL; DR\n\nUnfortunately, even in more optimistic scenario sims, the outcome is still quite dreadful. Earliest infectious people curve flattening is likely to be in June.
