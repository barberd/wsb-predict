We chatted for a while about the weather and then our conversation got to politics. They said they are big time farmers in Kentucky and that Trump's tariffs have been hurting them badly. So bad, that they told me their yearly outlook had declined upwards of 20 %. \n\nI asked if they voted for trump originally and they said yes. When asked if they'd do it again, they said yes. I asked why? Why would you vote for someone who's been directly impacting your life in a negative fashion? They proceeded to tell me that Trump's probably got a plan to reverse those tariffs on China so that China pays for them. \n\nDoes trump have a plan to save the market and propell it bigly? I don't know, but for me, I'm following this DD as it's straight from the source.
