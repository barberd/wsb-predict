Play I\u2019m thinking of currently is 4/24 80P. Here\u2019s the [Chart](https://imgur.com/a/CJhJj1u), apologies for Mobile ToS. \n\nAnd as I mentioned in my previous post about /NQ, I\u2019m watching for the 7600 level, if we dip below it\u2019s going to get real bloody. But if we hold it, should have a nice bounce tomorrow, cheaper puts.
