Even with the introduction of the TARP/QE model, I still made a killing, and the market still mostly MADE SENSE back then. Bad news, stonks go down, good news, stonks go up. Buy the dip (and it was a REAL dip) and you hold till moon.\n\nWaited 12 years for another recession opportunity and this is the bullshit we get... A fucking 19 day bear market. Then, inflated market, inflated assets, trillions printed, stonks only go up...\n\nNo fucking way I'm gonna FOMO into this overbought bullshit. If the market refuses to drop to a reasonable level, I'm cash gang until it does.\n\nI may be cash gang the rest of my fucking life. So be it. I refuse to buy this inflated, overbought bubble bullshit. If the market is going to be stuck in a bubble forever, it can do so without my money.\n\nMaybe I'll buy an overpriced house out in the countryside. Maybe I'll go full prepper. But fuck this stonk market. I'm OUT.", "created_utc": 1592268464.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h9sx5o/i_refuse_to_fomo_into_an_inflated_overbought/", "is_self": true}
