{"id": "g43sqp", "title": "Oil Prospects", "selftext": "What's up autists, let's not waste time while our trumpbux are still valuable. I'm here to inquire about some potential oil plays. APA and OKE.\n\nIf my investment thesis is true, I believe there is still time for money to be made in the interim, especially in markets such as oil. Despite the inevitability of the next stock market crash, I believe we're a good 3-12 months out. First and foremost, let me start off by saying that I could't give two fucks about your short term SPY put predictions. You should've rolled down ya momma's leg when you were born. I believe your autistic investment logic just as much as I believe my wife when she says she didn't fuck Darrell. YEAH RIGHT BITCH, I HEARD YOU MOANING WHEN DARRELL BENT YOU OVER LAST NIGHT, AND YOU LET HIM PLOW YOU HARDER THAN THOSE AUTIST BEARS GOT PLOWED BY THEIR MOTHERFUCKING $200 SPY PUTS THESE PAST TWO WEEKS! Alrighty then, I'm sorry to get side tracked, my ADHD makes me sped sometimes. I've had a long ass day and I can feel the Ritalin starting to ware off, lets not waste anymore time. \n\nPersonally I have reason to believe that the oil industry will be bullish following the recent contago. Despite the concurrent WTI, I think we'll be boomin come fall time. I know everybody is talking about oil tanker and oil ETF calls, but what about the actual oil companies? I think two companies that are being overlooked right now are Apache Corp ($APA) and Oneok ($OKE). Firstly, Oneok is extremely undervalued right now, [they](https://dwinnex.com/2020/04/17/oneok-inc-oke-increased-bullish-sentiment-favors-oke-the-most/) \"appear to be a solid investment option, with Wall Street analysts expecting its price to rise considerably in the next 12 months. This company generates high value from the labor resources and other capital it has available, and while it has heavy Long-Term Debt to Equity, the majority of the metrics point to this investment being highly attractive\". Now let's talk about Apache. I know Apache recently bottomed hard, and I know their recently accrued debt doesn't make them look too hot either, but to say they are done with is premature. They are sitting on top of a mountain of liquid gold, and nobody is talking about [it](https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Apache+Corp.+%28APA%29+Announces+Significant+Oil+Discovery+Offshore+Suriname+at+Sapakara+West-1/16699833.html). Wouldn't you now say that they are positioned to flourish long term? Now I know what you're about to say next, I understand that there is an abundance of oil yet a lack of demand for it concurrently. Here's the thing, the American people are ready to jump back on the Hamster wheel and get the economy up and running again, remember,  those boomer fucks 401Ks are bleeding, and they're terrified. Once the economy is reopened, a good 50% of those \"unemployed\" will jump back into the job market - in case it isn't clear enough yet, the vacancy is fundamentally a result of the federally mandated social distancing practices, and thus it is only temporary. Once companies are back in business, oil consumption will increase. I see the merit in the philosophy that the oil markets are at an all-time low: simply put, \"buy the dip\". Due to the circumstances contrived by beer virus, they will inevitably go up as the necessary demand increases. \n\nThese are the plays I've been contemplating:\n\nAPA - 1/15/2021 $10.00 Call\n\nOKE - 1/15/2021 $30.00 Call \n\nLet me know what you think", "created_utc": 1587282501.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g43sqp/oil_prospects/", "is_self": true}
