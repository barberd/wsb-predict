Your risk is 100% loss IF the stock goes to $0.\n\nYou sell a cash secured naked put for ABC at $8 strike price. Your risk is 100% loss if it gets exercised and the stock goes to $0. \n\nThere is no fucking risk difference besides getting paid a small premium to own ABC at a certain price. \n\nAm I missing something here? I feel like this is the closest thing to guaranteed returns in the stock market yet online all it talks about is how risky this strategy is. \n\nI see no fucking risk difference then buying a stupid stock outright. \n\nThe only downside I see is you need a big bankroll to secure the stocks if they\u2019re exercised to make any decent amount of  profit every month selling puts. \n\nProve me wrong. Tell me why this isn\u2019t the best stock trading strategy.
