As we all know, COVID-19 is currently buttfucking American markets, and turning Europe into one big lockdown zone one country at a time. We also know that during this time, rent, mortgages, etc are suspended, and when this happens, landlords and realtor groups lose money faster than $MSFT 200c 3/20 gang. I\u2019ve seen several posts on this sub about countries such as Brazil that are about to get the fucc from corona virus, but one I haven\u2019t seen is Japan, which got me to thinking, and then to doing research up till three in the morning pouring over news articles and data like a dirty college student cramming before a final. So here\u2019s what I found. \n\nJapan doesn\u2019t prop up their markets like China does (RIP to those FXI puts you made in February) and has American levels of stupidity when it comes to handling testing and treatment, and they\u2019re still letting people enter from mainland China. \n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2020/03/05/asia/japan-coronavirus-infection-levels-hnk-intl/index.html\n\n\u201cBut while the official number of people infected with coronavirus in Hokkaido may now be in the 80s, the actual number is likely to be ten times higher, said Hiroshi Nishiura, an epidemiologist at Hokkaido university. Nishiura, who is assisting the government in creating statistical models to help predict the spread of the virus, said the estimated figure is consistent with what he had seen in the Chinese city of Wuhan -- the epicenter of the outbreak.\u201d\n\n(Additional article on failure to test)\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/29/world/asia/japan-elderly-coronavirus.html\n\nNot only that, but according to census data almost 20% of Japanese people are daily smokers according to data from 2018, and COVID-19 attacks the respiratory system. You do the math. \n\nWhat\u2019s the point of all of this? A ticker, a strike price, and a date. Japanese real estate to get big fucc with at same rate as America, and we want stonks with healthy volume so therefore;\n\n$SMFG $2.5 10/16P\n\n(In for ten of these, haven\u2019t sold my xbox and tv for more puts yet)\n\nEDIT: a lot of my fellow autistic brethren here doubt me. I shall up the ante, if my puts have increased less than 50% in the next 30 days, I will walk up to my manager at work and tell him to go fuck himself\n(Craziest thing I can think of cuz I\u2019m not rarted enough to say I\u2019m gonna lick shit or something)", "created_utc": 1584677950.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flolkg/puts_on_japan_corona_virus_dd/", "is_self": true}
