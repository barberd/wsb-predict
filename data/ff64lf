Premion is probably more valuable than Tradedesk $TTD that trades for $260 a share. \n\nFor $18 a share you can own a stock that is gonna cost Apollo or GTN $25 a share and then they\u2019re gonna take the leftovers (Premion ) biz public.", "created_utc": 1583635257.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ff64lf/tgna_bidding_war_with_a_split/", "is_self": true}
