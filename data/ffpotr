Can they quarantine all the regions that pop up sick like they can in authoritarian China?  If you think so, go watch One Child Nation.

In America, Occupy USA got to camp out in your local park for months and got served hot chocolate.\n\nLook at the Johns Hopkins chart that shows new infections outside of China.  It\u2019s trending up more everyday.\n\nPuts to the moon my fellow idiots.", "created_utc": 1583730585, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffpotr/do_you_think_the_world_has_its_shit_together/", "is_self": true}
