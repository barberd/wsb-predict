{"id": "fwnicv", "title": "[TACO] Ain't nothing stopping cheap tacos", "selftext": "This is one of the strongest restaurants during the pandemic.  Around 600 locations (mostly on the west side) and nearly all of them support contactless takeout/delivery.  User reports heavy lineups at all locations in California.  Latest company earnings stated they saw upticks in customers (and that was right before the pandemic shitshow).  Lots of poor people now during the pandemic since they lost jobs and guess what, poor people gotta eat and ain't no cheaper fast food than this place (check out Taco Tuesdays).  This means they are doing better during the pandemic than before it!\n\n52 w high at 13.50 and 52 w low at 2.45.  Current price as of this post is 3.40.  Pre-pandemic it was around 8.\n\nGiven that they are STRONGER during the pandemic than before it, it should actually be around 8.  And factor in the repeat customer and positive branding they established during this period, its gonna hit 10 easily within 1-2 months.  Also, they got insider buys and recent passive stakes by some big funds (Russell Investments Group).\n\nConsider also that they really have no competition anymore.  All those mom-and-pop taco places are fucking dead, out of business.  Del Taco standing strong here and taking away all their fat fuck customers.\n\nLastly, their ticker name is fucking awesome.\n\n7777 shares at 3.25 and holding like a mofo.  Can add another 7777 if it dips below 3.", "created_utc": 1586276874.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fwnicv/taco_aint_nothing_stopping_cheap_tacos/", "is_self": true}
