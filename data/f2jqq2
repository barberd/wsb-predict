{"id": "f2jqq2", "title": "$S is still a buy", "selftext": "\\- T-Mobile and Sprint haven\u2019t renewed the merger agreement since it lapsed Nov. 1. T-Mobile has suggested there could be new terms, including on the price. Before the deal can close, it still needs approvals from California\u2019s utility board and from a federal judge in Washington who has yet to sign off on the Justice Department\u2019s settlement allowing the deal. ( LA Times)\n\n\\- The states challenging the T-Mobile/Sprint deal were New York, California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin.\u00a0New York Attorney General\u00a0Letitia James [said](https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2020/attorney-general-james-statement-t-mobilesprint-ruling) she and other state attorneys general are \"review\\[ing\\] our options, including a possible appeal.\"(ars)\n\n\\-\u201cToday\u2019s judicial decision approving the Sprint/T-Mobile merger despite the objections of several other states is welcome news for Kansas,\" Schmidt said. \"As I said in July when we joined with the U.S. Department of Justice in formally approving the merger subject to several conditions, this will benefit Kansas consumers by increasing competition in our state, expanding quality coverage in many rural areas of Kansas, expediting the deployment of 5G technology for Kansans, and protecting and expanding Kansas jobs. We intend to hold the merged company to its promises of investment in its Kansas network and of maintaining substantial employment at what will become the combined company\u2019s \u2018second headquarters\u2019 in Overland Park.\u201d (WIBW)\n\nThere are still disputes and persuasions going on states wide. But TMUS will, I think, hurry the renegotiation process and get it done before appeals happen. Softbank now got Paul Singer on their side, and the vision fund had been clearing up ever since the pulled WeWork IPO. I'd think T-Mobile already got a fairly cheap price in the not-yet-renewed agreement, and a delay won't be in their favor. Softbank will also want this long winded merger to go through as promised for a sign of reboot. \n\nSo $9.4 per share for $S won't be unreasonable, and it will happen rather soon with the today's strong  support levels.", "created_utc": 1581473987, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f2jqq2/s_is_still_a_buy/", "is_self": true}
