There was no control group, so we have no idea what the discharge rates were for people outside of Remdesivir. \n\nNow tell me how that is the positive news enough to drive past the worst GDP number we've had in years? That blew by the already terrible expectations, and will require economists to forecast further damage to the economy?\n\nThis is clown world.
