Not only have essentials flown off the shelves, but I\u2019m sure lot of people took their stimulus checks and went straight to Amazon.com to buy themselves unnecessary shit, like an industrial grade water fountain for their kitchen. I used to have a small third party Amazon FBA business. I was reading seller forums and saw a few people mentioning their sales shot up after stimulus checks were dispersed mentioning they had their best day in sales since Black Friday. With everyone being quarantined and Amazon already dominating the e-commerce space, tell me why I shouldn\u2019t go in for $10k.", "created_utc": 1587511126.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5q26q/amzn_earnings/", "is_self": true}
