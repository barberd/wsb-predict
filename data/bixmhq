{"id": "bixmhq", "title": "FIT short opportunity???", "selftext": "I\u2019ve been looking at the income statements and balance sheet for FIT and their gross profits have been decreasing YOY. FitBit just slashed their prices on a lot of their products (I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s because their sales are dropping and they\u2019re trying to incentivize people to buy them). Looking at their balance sheet their equity is also dropping consistently over the past 3 years. Also my final point in my analysis is when is the last time you even saw someone wearing a damn Fitbit. I swear them shits just live on the store shelves. \n\nWith their ER on Wednesday I was thinking about picking up some puts. What do you guys think about this?", "created_utc": 1556588536, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bixmhq/fit_short_opportunity/", "is_self": true}
