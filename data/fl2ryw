Currently, it's switching between 11203 and 10653. 10.6k would be a 22.8% daily increase.\n\nThe website has a search bar, just search for the virus name. I cant link it because of auto-mod.\n\nBonus: Garett Randall from Myrtle Beach, SC says he'll contract the Coronavirus and stream it in 4k if he can raise $14000. What a moron.
