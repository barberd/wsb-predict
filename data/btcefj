In a previous thread from today, some of you asked what the Nifty Fifty and are apparently too lazy to use google, so I wanted to regale you with its history. The Nifty Fifty was a group of high growth stock such as McDonald\u2019s, Disney, Polaroid, Xerox, and 46 others that existed during the 1960\u2019s and early 1970\u2019s. These were the original FANG names that had new technology such as copiers, drive through windows, franchise business models, and cameras that developed film instantly. Competition couldn\u2019t touch them. They were the Golden Geese and anyone who didn\u2019t own them were basically idiots... \n\nThey benefitted from secular AND cyclical growth trends in the United States and were growing earnings by 20-30% per year. Every money manager that tried to outperform it got crushed and many of those mutual funds that underperformed went out of business. As the Nifty Fifty became more of a sure bet, more and more professionals and individuals entrusted their money to the Nifty Fifty. This led to multiples in the 50-70x range for earnings. But people didn\u2019t care- they had outperformed for years and growth seemed limitless! why would they stop now?\n\nEventually, the party was over in the 1970\u2019s and the Nifty Fifty got crushed to the tune of 70-80%. Sometimes it was earnings slowing down, sometimes just multiple compression, other times inflation just ripped everyone to shreds, sometimes new technology came around that made them obsolete. Some went bankrupt. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what the lesson is here. Maybe it is there is no such thing as a sure thing? I don\u2019t know if the QQQ or SPY or FANG is a similar bubble or not- but I just like the story and thought you guys would like it too.", "created_utc": 1558900635, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/btcefj/the_nifty_fifty_a_history_of_sure_things/", "is_self": true}
