{"id": "h9unyu", "title": "Why Oil is Set to Skyrocket and So Are You", "selftext": "**So this is the cool thing about oil.** Demand has bottomed, and has shown only small green shoots of recovery. In fact, the climb from -$999999 WTI to +$37 can be accounted for **solely through the supply side, where producers are literally falling over themselves to cut supply.**\n\nPretty shitty right? Decreased demand, price increases only from supply, we're completely fucked! Well, not really.\n\nThe reality is that **supply continues to dwindle** as oil producers scramble to cut costs. Simultaneously, **demand has nowhere to go but up, it's basically at the lowest point it's ever going to be at ever.**\n\nSo what do you get when demand finally recovers? You get an **oil crunch**. Demand surpasses supply and the oil producers, traumatized from the recent negative oil vortex, have neither the will nor the ability to amp up supply quickly enough to meet it. Crude oil skyrockets, the energy companies are saved, and **you profit massively.**\n\n**You can play this one of two ways.** Either make long bets on U.S. energy companies that hit their profit sweet spot at around **$40-$45 WTI.** Or place calls on one of the many ravaged oil funds (USO, UCO, etc.) that, believe it or not, actually do catch increases in oil prices (after some shady reorganization, but that's a story for another day). Of course, if the world ends, we're all fucked, but in that case you've got bigger things to worry about (like buying puts on everything but Zoom Video, which is invincible and will survive the heat death of the universe).\n\n*(Calls one month out at least boys, I can't guarantee that your grandma will be driving as often in the very near future)*\n\n*(Oil is also a great inflation play if you're worried about JPOW printing us into oblivion. If the dollar is devalued, you need more of them to buy a barrel, no two ways about it*)\n\n*(Watch for volatility, it's going to be a wild ride to the top).*\n\nGood luck, fellow autists.", "created_utc": 1592274601.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h9unyu/why_oil_is_set_to_skyrocket_and_so_are_you/", "is_self": true}
