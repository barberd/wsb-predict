It's the next gen diabetes treatment that not only brings down your sugar levels to healthy levels, it also has this nasty side effect of helping you lose weight as well. Novo has been leading the jilp game.. so what does this have to do with our savior EMIS?\n\nJilp treatments have always been injectable but Emisphere discovered a way to take the jilp treatments and condense them into an oral tablet. They now have partnered with Novo with a ROYALTY BASED AGREEMENT for their oral glp-1 drug that is currently in Phase 3 and Novo just filed for accelerated approval of the oral jilp. Now this is huge because they'll be the first to have type 2 diabetes treatment that is taken in an oral form. Who would rather take a needle then just pop a tablet into your mouth?\n\nEmisphere is just sitting there waiting for the drug to be approved and then they'll be racking in millions in royalty fees. Get in here before it's too late. You heard it here first.\n\ntl;dr emisphere partnered to sell an oral treatment for type two diabetes and once the drug is approved it's going to make bank. get in before it's too late", "created_utc": 1552581163, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b12ful/emis_major_tendies_next_gen_type_2_diabetes/", "is_self": true}
