They\u2019re a penny stock trading at about .21 closing today. \n\nThey\u2019re def making themselves known. I researched their product reviews and it\u2019s either a hit or miss w them. Lately I\u2019ve been thinking they\u2019re overcompensating for quality by making a lot of diff stuff. Their CEO seems to have stuff under control but could be a facade for all ik.\n\nAnyways, not thinking about selling or anything just wanted to get y\u2019alls input on this.", "created_utc": 1568852520, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d665g1/razff/", "is_self": true}
