Basically saying, nothing to see here, why such a crazy reaction, this is already shit we knew. \n\nMeantime like 18 hours ago Bloomberg puts oht an article at 5 am EST saying something along the lines or \u201cChina is prepared to do a limited deal\u201d from an anonymous source which pumped futures and set us up for the pump today. \n\nIt\u2019s almost as if they were surprised other things can move markets besides their own tactically released articles. \n\nAnd then you got CNBC over there like \u201cwe don\u2019t fuckin know man.
