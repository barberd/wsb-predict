{"id": "ftnoze", "title": "Why the Coronavirus Is Weighing on These Beauty Stocks", "selftext": " \n\nWhile the coronavirus pandemic has been a major headwind for most companies, it represents a particular challenge for sellers and makers of makeup and beauty products. **Coty** [(NYSE: COTY)](https://www.fool.com/premium/company/288034), the owner of Cover Girl and Rimmel brands, has posted\u00a0a 52% share decline so far this year, while **Ulta Beauty** [(NASDAQ: ULTA)](https://www.fool.com/premium/company/217246), seller of cosmetics and skincare products, has fallen\u00a029%. At the same time, the S&P 500 Index slipped\u00a019%.\n\nThe [COVID-19 outbreak](https://www.fool.com/coronavirus/), which started in China in January and spread throughout the world over the past two months, has created supply-chain disruptions for a wide variety of companies. It also has hurt demand from tourists as travel has been halted and forced stores to temporarily shut their doors.\n\n \n\n## Less need for makeup\n\nStores that sell beauty products have followed this general lockdown movement. For example, Ulta announced\u00a0it would shut stores until at least March 31 but urged customers to continue to shop through its app or e-commerce site.\n\nWhile the switch to online shopping has been strong in essential areas like grocery, it won't necessarily be as beneficial for companies like Ulta. Sure, shoppers are stuck at home in front of their computers, but their focus is more on stocking their pantries with essentials in case of extended lockdowns. At the same time, many people are telecommuting, and outside meetings and events have been canceled. That means less of an immediate need for makeup, perfume, and other beauty products.\n\nEconomic figures this week offered consumers even less of a reason to shop. U.S. unemployment hit a record high, with initial jobless claims reaching more than 3 million in the week ending March 21, according to the Labor Department. The department cited the impact of the coronavirus pandemic as the reason for the massive number of filings.\n\nThat's bad news for [discretionary spending](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest-in-consumer-discretionary-stocks.aspx). As people lose their jobs, makeup, apparel, and entertainment may lose out to purchases of food, beverages, and other staples.\n\n## Withdrawing guidance\n\nCompanies have already been feeling the shock. Ulta said\u00a0it drew down $800 million under a revolving credit facility as a precautionary measure in consideration of the health crisis. It also said it's re-evaluating the timing of a stock repurchase program.\n\nCoty, which launched a turnaround\u00a0plan last July, withdrew\u00a0its fiscal 2020 guidance and said it expects third-quarter net revenue to fall 20% on a like-for-like basis. Even **Estee Lauder** [(NYSE: EL)](https://www.fool.com/premium/company/203377), which has grown\u00a0revenue the past three quarters and surpassed analysts' earnings estimates\u00a0for the past four, isn't faring any better. The maker of perfume, skincare, and cosmetics reported in a filing that it was withdrawing fiscal 2020 second-half and full-year guidance, saying it doesn't expect to meet that guidance due to temporary store closures in North America and Europe.\n\n[Estee Lauder](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/02/29/is-estee-lauder-still-a-buy.aspx) shares\u00a0have fared better than Ulta and Coty so far this year, slipping only 20%. But as all three companies proceed with caution due to the coronavirus outbreak, so should investors.\n\nEven after the health crisis is over, cosmetics makers and sellers may suffer from weaker demand until the U.S. employment picture brightens and the overall economy improves. Investors should pay close attention to the companies' next earnings reports to see how they weathered the crisis and how they plan to recover.", "created_utc": 1585839203.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ftnoze/why_the_coronavirus_is_weighing_on_these_beauty/", "is_self": true}
