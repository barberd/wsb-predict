Earlier that day, Boeing had a major run up from about $100 to about $127 at close. My thought was, this could be a short term trend that continues for at least the next day with the stimulus bill pending and it would probably take a lot to bring it back down given all the known problems at the company.\nWell I placed the order at 3:58 and of course it didn\u2019t fill. And of course the next day, Wednesday, there\u2019s another huge run up to close around $165. \u201cMy\u201d calls from the previous day went from $3.05 to $21. Crap, well right before close, at about 3:58, I decided to buy some 155 puts 3/27 (again roughly $1,000) because there\u2019s no way there could be a three day run like that! The ole gamblers fallacy. Well, we come here today, BA closed at $185 and \u201cmy\u201d calls are now worth between $35 and $40 each (depending on time of day/accuracy of spreads).\n\nSo instead of making $10,000+ on calls, my puts are down about 83%.\n\nConclusion: call me Jon Snow because I know nothing. \n\nPosition: BA 155p 3/27", "created_utc": 1585286881.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fprdm5/storytimeunrealized_gains_reversereverse/", "is_self": true}
