{"id": "fa041c", "title": "$EWG Puts", "selftext": "Germany\u2019s about to get slapped by the corona virus u/Preparedqt, who\u2019s from Germany, laid out a pretty solid case for why this is gonna happen in the next couple weeks thanks to someone with the \ud83c\udf7a deciding to go to a nationally renowned banger know as carnival ([post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9xmj2/germany_doesnt_look_too_good/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)). Digging a little further a google search brought up another [article](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2020-02-26/german-authorities-say-man-with-virus-in-critical-condition%3fcontext=amp)  who quoted Germany\u2019s health minister saying Wednesday that the country was \u201cat the beginning of an epidemic\u201d.
