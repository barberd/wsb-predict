{"id": "hgypxy", "title": "Tech is Not a Overvalued", "selftext": "I see a ton of you guys posting about waiting for the tech bubble to pop and I want to help you guys stop losing money by clearing up some common misconceptions I see in the daily threads. Here goes:\n\n**1) Tech is not a single industry, it is the combination of multiple different industries in various stages of their life-cycles**, all of which's business model are impacted differently by Covid 19. Yes, there are consumer products, social media, online retail and advertising, but there is also security, infrastructure, enterprise management software, database management, content delivery networks, gaming, financial services, communications, etc. All of these have different revenue models, customer types and growth trajectories independent of each other. By labeling them all tech and not understanding why they may or may not be thriving, you're going to miss out on big runs or talk yourself into costly contrarian puts during runs.\n\nWith the understanding that tech is not a monolith, but many industries, think about how covid actually impacts these individual industries. In many cases, covid has accelerated digital transformation and sped up adoption of these companies. Web services are more important than before (MSFT, AMZN), security is critical (CRWD, OKTA, ZS), more people are viewing content from the internet (NET, FSLY, AKAM) and main street retail is closed (SHOP, AMZN, ETSY), etc. etc. ***Most of these companies are non-discretionary or infrastructure spend*** \\- nobody is cancelling an important enterprise management system (VEEV, EVBG, CRM, NOW) because of covid - they'll fire headcount first. \n\n**2) If your analysis is that the company is not profitable and so its overvalued, you're doing it wrong.** *Know the difference between Gross Margins and Operating Profit.* If the company's core business is very profitable and they're spending a fuckload on product development, hiring sales and building corporate infrastructure, it doesn't matter if their operating profit is negative if their sales are growing 35%. The revenues will catch up. Quickly.\n\n**3) The Subscription Based Revenue Model (SaaS) is the greatest things to happen to these companies and investors in 20 years.** Having smooth, recurring, reliable revenue streams, impacted only by churn and growth allows helps eliminate big negative surprises during earnings and compounds growth quickly for the businesses. \n\nTake MSFT for example - for us boomers (I'm 40), they used to release a new Windows updates every 2-3 years and inevitably you'd have to purchase it, adapt to it, and sometimes you'd skip an update. Their earnings were based on how popular the updates were and how much people bought them. In 2015, they switched from that model to SaaS (software as a service). Now, I pay an annual subscription to MSFT for their applications. I never think about it - its just subtracted from my account - and will pay it as long as I have a computer. They dont have to worry about coming up with big new updates.\n\nCompare this to some other industries. Life Sciences - you invest millions in research and the drug has to show efficacy and get approved by FDA, which is major boom or bust. Automotive - design a great car and hope you find a market for it, but then your sales are massively impacted macro trends. Nobody is fucking cancelling MSFT subscriptions during a recession.\n\n**4) Tech's operating model makes its potential for exponential growth unmatched.** For a company like Fastly or Okta, think about what you would actually have to do to provide the infrastructure for 40% annual growth - you spend on product development, hiring customer success/support and sales people. You beef up HR, operating systems and infrastructure. *But your biggest expense by far is hiring people, who can work from home and be quickly removed.* \n\nCompare that to some other industries. For a car company to grow 40%, beyond the people cost, they need massive capex investments to improve their production infrastructure and they'll have to be sure their supply chain of small manufacturers can keep up, not to mention the impact of fluctuations in raw material costs (read, tarriffs), marketing and inventory storage. Thats a lot of moving parts. These implications apply to most manufacturing industries. For a life sciences company to grow 40%, they have to discover a massive blockbuster medicine, because users of current non-generic medications don't spike 40% a year. Put simply, it is much easier/cheaper/faster to just hire people and acquire technology than having to have physical infrastructure, supply chains, warehousing etc. This makes techs growth potential vastly superior than other industries.\n\n**5) Finally, and most importantly, this is not 2001. I will repeat this for the real boomers here who were burned before, this is not 2001.** In 2001 the companies did not have real growth, revenue, consumer adoption. Today they do. Take a look at Redpoints look at 2020 Q1 earnings for public SaaS companies ( [https://medium.com/redpoint-ventures/a-look-back-at-q1-public-saas-earnings-e392a7f6f4f8](https://medium.com/redpoint-ventures/a-look-back-at-q1-public-saas-earnings-e392a7f6f4f8) ). The median company of the 54 public companies followed had 31% YoY growth, 74% gross margin and 117% customer retention. Thats insane.\n\nTLDR; tech is not overvalued - these cloud companies are growing exponentially and in many cases, their business models and adoption/use of their services are enhanced by Covid. \n\nPOSITIONS - FSLY 50C, 60C 9/18, SPOT 130C 7/17, DDOG 90C 8/21, NET 36C 8/21, SE 106C 7/17, ENPH 50C 8/2, TWLO 210C 8/21\n\nMy qualifications - I spent many years as strategic consultant with a fancy mba that focused on business growth and have worked in literally every industry", "created_utc": 1593282594.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hgypxy/tech_is_not_a_overvalued/", "is_self": true}
