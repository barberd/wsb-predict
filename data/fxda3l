{"id": "fxda3l", "title": "Actually meeting your heroes: Dr. Michael Burry", "selftext": "**Intro**\n\n[The Big short](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Short_(film). What a ride. \n\nFrom the storyline to Prison Mike as [Eisman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Eisman), I bussed a fat metaphorical nut to the beautiful ode of revenge porn happening right in front of my very eyes.\n\nDo you remember the \"outcast\", the \"weirdo\", the literal [\"autist\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Burry) hero?\n\nWell, it turns out it was all fucking cinema.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\n**Movie/Book**\n\nIn the movie, Dr. Burry is portrayed as the lone crazy MD who saw the '08 crash coming & warned everyone. \n\nAgainst everyone & everything, he was right & very rich by the end of the reel.\n\nI loved him for that. How the fuck could you not? One man against the entire financial system and he fucking WINS?\n\n\nSo at the end, we're told that he dissolves the hedge fund (cause oh, he's **too pure**) and goes to invest in \"water\", whatever the fuck that means.\n\nWell, it turns out it was all fucking cinema, too.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\n**Scion**\n\nDr. Burry came back. Of course he did, how could he not? Purity is for nerds. He's a chad now. \n\n[Scion Asset Mangament.] (https://fintel.io/i/scion-asset-management-llc)\n\nPrivate Hedgefund.\n\nOwner? Dr. Michael J Burry, MD\n\nAUM? [Probs around $200 millis last year](https://smartasset.com/financial-advisor/scion-asset-management-review).\n\nStrategy? Dr. Burry's self-diagnosed autism.\n\nHotel? Trivago\n\nNow, in 2020, even with his majesty's most brilliant autistic transendence, he got blindsided. \n\nOh, Dr. Burry foolishly thought stonks only go up. With Johnald \"Pump\" Beautiful Genes at the helm, how could they ever go down?\n\n**Well, they fucking did.**\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\n**The Damage**\n\n[This nathan has been getting smoked on the way down](https://imgur.com/a/jYBtSj6). \n\nHow much down? around $40 millis.\n\nHis portfolio includes *Gamestop*. He owns **2.3 million shares of GME**. Isn't that oh so wonderful?\n\n\nIrregardless, this loss has clearly upset him a bit. \n\n--------------------------------------------\n**The fucking Twitter**\n\nHe recently logged on to his PC from OfficeDepot & opened a twitter account. What an accomplishment doctor, way to go!\n\nHis message: \n\n* [2% of the population dying is nothing](https://twitter.com/michaeljburry/status/1247654699253133313)\n\n* [Don't quarantine because domestic violence will rise](https://twitter.com/michaeljburry/status/1247338200269389824)\n* [Flu kills more people](https://twitter.com/michaeljburry/status/1245229743043043331)\n* [Let the economy run, it's way more important](https://twitter.com/michaeljburry/status/1247910540212461569)\n* [Wet Markets should stay open, because Fauci is too high income & doesn't understand poverty](https://twitter.com/michaeljburry/status/1246187733933907968)\n\nGeneral denialist wallstreet ivory tower bullshit. You be the judge.\n\nIn my humble, dumb, non-MD opinion, letting an additional 2% of the population die may be a bit controversial. Now, I'm not an expert or anything, but especially if the reason to not let it happen is to let low-income middle-class folks such as Dr. Burry profit off of their millions.\n\nIrregardless, this gentlesir has gone full Ackman. He wants his tendies back one way or another.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\n**TL;DR : The autist god Dr. Burry is against you. He hates short sellers. He wants his economy back.**\n\n**TL;DR for TL;DR: Burry shit the bed.**", "created_utc": 1586374954.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxda3l/actually_meeting_your_heroes_dr_michael_burry/", "is_self": true}
