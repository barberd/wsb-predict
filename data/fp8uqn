Yea the unemployment numbers are gonna be released but I doubt they will do much. Charts dont only go down as I said before and we have a decent dead cat bounce on our hands, expect a bearflag into another leg down soon.\n\nTL:DR - Sideways/Small precentage up aka bearflag until the next leg down somewhere in april (probably 2 weeks)\n\nEdit - Anyone with puts expiring shortly you will get fucked by theta btw good luck", "created_utc": 1585216458.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fp8uqn/a_serious_post_between_all_the_non_serious_posts/", "is_self": true}
