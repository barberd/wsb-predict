The citizens of Michigan are batting a whopping .359 at the healthcare facilities when being tested for the beer virus.\n\n[https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/)\n\nYou heard it right folks, this is cause for another +5% on the SP500 tomorrow.  My SPY 5/1 220P is going to be worthless tomorrow!\n\nNew POS SPY 300C, should be there by Thursday :D\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Congrats to Michigan on moving into the #3 position only behind New York and New Jersey.  Also now batting an astronomical .415 to make Tigers fans really proud.\n\nMake my new prediction +7% on SPY tomorrow, calls gonna print :)", "created_utc": 1586279957.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fwognh/covid19_in_michigan/", "is_self": true}
