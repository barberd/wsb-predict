I know most of you retards bet on short term plays and gamble your life savings on SPY puts, but I want to propose a long play that you should hold for a few months and let develop. One thing Wall Street consistently struggles with is the valuation of pharmaceutical stocks. These guys just do not understand strong science (lucky for you, I do)!  Don\u2019t get me wrong, a strong balance sheet always matters; however, sometimes Wall Street puts a little too much weight on how 1-2 bad quarters of debt looks for a pharmaceutical company because they don\u2019t understand the products.\n\nI know, I know\u2026.get to the fucking point guy. Ticker, date, strike. Ok, here, TAK 1/15/21 $20 to $30 calls. Just buy them and thank me later.  No, I do not own a ton of them, I\u2019m not rich enough for a pump and dump scheme.  Yes, I know volume isn't high....I still don't care just buy them and hold because I am literally giving you free money right now.  You're welcome. If you don't trust me because I don't have an extensive history, sorry, you need a pharmacy guy around here.  Let me offer you something besides SPY.\n\nAnyways, I digress, January 2019: Takeda acquires Shire Pharmaceuticals for $62 BILLION. Yes, you read that correct SIXTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS\u2026.HOLLY S\\*\\*\\* RIGHT!?!? ([Reference](https://www.takeda.com/newsroom/newsreleases/2019/takeda-completes-acquisition-of-shire-becoming-a-global-values-based-rd-driven-biopharmaceutical-leader/) )\n\nOk, now let\u2019s look at the Takeda ticker:\n\n[TAK 5 YEAR](https://preview.redd.it/b71060h5rgt41.png?width=1324&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7774906e55150c469845be40e37d500b641c11a)\n\nSo you are looking at a company, who is a MASSIVE conglomerate of 2 incredibly successful pharmaceutical companies...\u2026.with a smaller market cap than either individual company prior to the merger.  Ok, I know that's not an easy sentence to read and understand, most of you are actually retarded, we have over 1 million here and statistics would likely say we got dumb money and dumb folks here, so what I'm saying is:\n\nIf 1 + 1 = 2, then Takeda + Shire should = ENOURMOUS MARKET CAP THAT IS ADDITIVE.\n\nInstead, we have 1 + 1 = 0.7.  Yes, Takeda bought shire for $64 BILLION, and has a smaller market cap than prior to buying Shire.  Makes sense.....\n\nQuarterly earnings for Takeda are 5/13.  Just buy LEAPS or further dated calls and thank me later, they will crush earnings like this bull market has been wrecking my gay bear ass.  Takeda has a phenomenal product line with Shire's under them now as well.  They were dealing with a credit downgrade after the acquisition, but have avoided junk ratings (which I find impressive).  In addition, they have divested many \"non-core\" assets to improve the way their finances look for the purposes of helping the share holders ([Reference)](https://www.takeda.com/newsroom/newsreleases/2020/takeda-completes-sale-of-select-otc-and-non-core-assets-to-stada/).  These guys mean business, and I'm thinking price target of $30-$40 if the fed and Donny Pump keep doing their thing.\n\nTAK 1/15/21 Calls.  I bought a 5/15 $12.50 call today for $4.40....lol, I basically got it for the share price.  Go scalp some easy tendies my friends!\n\nEdit: grammar and date of earnings.", "created_utc": 1587167100.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g3dcsk/dd_on_takeda_from_your_friendly_wsb_pharmacist/", "is_self": true}
