I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 19th, 2019.\n\n# **Here\u2019s what Powell could say at Jackson Hole to soothe the roller coaster markets  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/16/heres-what-powell-could-say-at-jackson-hole-to-soothe-the-markets.html)**\n*****\n&gt; If the markets get their way, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will use the Fed\u2019s Jackson Hole symposium to clarify whether the Fed is at the beginning of a serious rate cutting cycle \u2014 or just intending to cut a few times, as insurance against a possible downturn.\n*****\n&gt; Powell speaks Friday morning to kick off the Fed\u2019s annual Jackson Hole symposium in Wyoming, and that event is the main focus of markets in the week ahead. The Fed also releases the minutes of its July meeting Wednesday afternoon, and it is expected to detail discussions around its decision to cut interest rates last month for the first time in more than a decade.\n*****\n&gt; In a briefing following that meeting, Powell discussed the quarter point rate cut as a \u201cmidcycle adjustment,\u201d implying it was just considering a few cuts. That comment shook markets, and interest rates have plunged, along with global bond yields.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat the market wants is clearly that he moves away from the \u2018midcycle adjustment\u2019 commentary and transition toward an easing cycle,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.\n*****\n&gt; Markets also will be watching any developments that reveal how trade talks between the U.S. and China are faring. President Donald Trump soothed some nerves in the past week when he delayed some of his latest tariffs on Chinese goods. Trump also said Thursday that discussions are continuing, and that he expects to talk to President Xi Jinping soon, though he gave no details.\n*****\n&gt; Powell speaks at a time when markets have been doubting the Fed\u2019s ability to head off a recession. Since he spoke on July 31, the stock market has been turbulent, with the S&amp;P 500 losing nearly 3%, but the move in interest rates has been massive. The 10-year yield was at 2.07% that day, and touched a low of 1.475% on Thursday before returning to 1.54% by late Friday.\n*****\n&gt; The Treasury\u2019s 30-year bond made a historic move in the past week, when its yield fell to a record low of 1.915%, before rising back above 2% Friday. Also, the most widely watched part of the yield curve inverted, when the 2-year yield made the unusual move of temporarily rising above the 10-year yield. That would be taken as a sign of pending recession if it inverts again and stays that way for some time.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were lower for the week, but reversed sharper losses by the end of the week. The S&amp;P 500 was up 1.4% Friday at 2,888, but was down 1% for the week. The Dow rose 1.2% to 25,886 Friday, but lost 1.5% for the week.\n*****\n&gt; Dramatic moves in the world\u2019s sovereign yields came as global central banks cut interest rates, and there was talk from a European Central Bank official that the ECB could use a big stimulus program. That puts extra pressure on the Fed, which has emphasized that it could lower rates because of the weak global economy, the impact of trade wars and sluggish inflation. Rates all over the globe moved lower, and the benchmark German 10-year bund set a new low of negative 0.73 Friday morning.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThey don\u2019t want to signal they\u2019re worried about the economy because the economy is doing okay, \u201d said Pramod Alturi, fixed income portfolio manager at Capital Group. \u201cI think they can do it. It\u2019s going to be a tough communications challenge. The worry is when they try to tow the line, they end up being more hawkish than the market is looking for.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Michelle Meyer, head of U.S. economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said she is looking for Powell to comment on the yield curve inversion and the market turbulence. \u201cIs he more concerned about the outlook?\u201d she said. \u201cHas he become more concerned since the meeting, given the slowdown in global data, the increase of risks in the trade war and the recent significant moves in the market\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; The fed funds futures market is pricing in two to three rate cuts for the balance of the year. Since the Fed meeting, the market has become more concerned about the economy, with weaker global data from Europe and China, as well as a new round of tariffs on Chinese goods, announced by President Donald Trump.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIs Powell going to stick to the midcycle adjustment? It\u2019s only been three weeks, but you throw in the sharp inversion of the yield curve and the extra consumer tariffs ... is he going to let the market whipsaw him? We\u2019ve seen a big inversion and a sharp drop in rates since that meeting,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief market strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said the Fed tries to avoid making policy changes at the Jackson Hole meeting, but it was done during the financial crisis.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIs it going to be an academic speech? Or is he going to pull a Ben Bernanke and use Jackson Hole as his FOMC venue. It was really [former Fed Chairman] Bernanke who most notably [used the meeting to discuss policy] when he laid out the case for QE twice,\u201d Boockvar said.\n*****\n&gt; Powell could also have to defend the Fed\u2019s independence, and reiterate that he will stay in his position until his term expires, particularly after President Donald Trump criticized Fed policy and called him \u201cclueless\u201d this week.\n*****\n&gt; Besides the Fed, there are some economic reports of interest in the week ahead. Existing home sales are announced Wednesday and PMI manufacturing and services data is released Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; Krosby said she is watching developments with Huawei, since the temporary licenses for U.S. firms doing business with the black-listed Chinese company end on August 19.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn terms of headlines this could be a market mover because of Huawei\u2019s importance to Beijing. If there is an extension from the administration it could suggest an improvement in the D.C./Beijing dialogue, no doubt a positive headline,\u201d she said, in an email. \u201cWe could find out what happens from a presidential tweet or from the Department of Commerce, which has jurisdiction over the issue.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/RDAmtkO.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/YZ4Sp9Z.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/GSRf9g6.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/qteAZFw.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/6s0utYP.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nXQnR8z.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/LpuE7Gf.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/igaeQ3X.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/d6Yxsri.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n*(NONE.)*\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/jhHlyHN.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/rtYUoFX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/yf1n5YF.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Down Friday/Down Monday Streak Ending: A Quick Recovery Still Needed\n\n&gt; Barring a late-day reversal, DJIA\u2019s streak of Down Friday/Down Monday (DF/DM) will end today at two in a row. Recently we examined the record of past DF/DM occurrencesand noted that a quick DJIA recovery to pre-DF/DM levels was usually positive as it typically meant the worst of the decline was likely over. Today we delve deeper into the history of two or more DF/DMs in a row. \n\n&gt; Excluding the most recent occurrence, there have been two or more consecutive DF/DM\u2019s 39 times since 2000. Of these 39, only four occurrences included three in a row. Using the last DF/DM of the streak as the starting point, the average decline from a subsequent high (within seven calendar days of Monday\u2019s close) to the low sometime during the next 90 calendar days was 6.05% and all but three occurrences suffered a subsequent decline. Using Monday\u2019s close as the refence point, the average decline was 4.53%. Only six of the 39 occurrences did not close lower than Monday\u2019s close. The average number of calendar days until the low was reached was 45.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2a585fbd0aabbcd377847808e5468eb9/5fd8a54415df2501-d0/s500x750/efa5fb4470880fa20bff91be98cac5f8a83a3d34.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Looking at the 30 trading days before and the 60 trading days after Monday\u2019s close of the last DF/DM of the streak, the patterns are similar to single DF/DM occurrences. If DJIA did not make a quick recovery to pre-DF/DM levels, then DJIA tended to struggle and drift lower.\n\n*****\n\n# Yield Curve Inversion Triggers Risk Aversion\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.stocktradersalmanac.com/UploadedImage/blog_20190814_3_per_losses_b4&amp;after.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Unless you have been asleep for most of the day in preparation for an upcoming midnight shift, you have probably already heard, over and over, how the 10-year Treasury bond yield falling below the 2-year Treasury bond yield has a perfect record in recent years of forecasting a recession sometime in the future. The result was declines exceeding 3% by DJIA and NASDAQ. S&amp;P 500 just missed this mark falling 2.9%. Since 1971, when NASDAQ began, this combination of losses or worse has only occurred 66 times prior to today. And of these 66 times, 25 occurred during the financial crisis bear in 2008 and early 2009.\n\n&gt; Plotting the 30 trading days before and 60 trading days after past occurrences reveals (top chart) initial steep and brisk declines followed by modest average gains over the following 60 trading days (approximately three calendar months). However, market performance did pick up nicely at the 6-month and 12-month later points and the frequency of gains also improved. The market could be in for more choppy trading especially in the often-turbulent months of August, September and October.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.stocktradersalmanac.com/UploadedImage/blog_20190814_3_per_losses_table_DJIA.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.stocktradersalmanac.com/UploadedImage/blog_20190814_3_per_losses_table_SP500.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.stocktradersalmanac.com/UploadedImage/blog_20190814_3_per_losses_table_NASDAQ.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Yield Curve Inversion Raises Economic Questions\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the spread between the 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields fell as low as -2 basis points (-0.02%) in trading on August 14.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.lpl.com/content/dam/lpl-www/images/Article_Page/yield-curve-blog-081419-artimg.png))**\n\n&gt; Typically, yield curve inversion, when long-term yields fall below short-term yields, is viewed as a signal of oncoming recession, although often with a relatively long lead. In the past five economic expansions, the U.S. economy has peaked an average of 21 months after the spread between the 2-year and 10-year yields initially turned negative.\n\n&gt; **U.S. Economy Remains on Solid Footing**\n\n&gt; Even though we\u2019re discouraged by the yield curve\u2019s shape right now, we see few signs of danger ahead. Data shows the U.S. economy is on solid footing, and corporate debt spreads have remained contained in this latest bout of volatility. Financial conditions are still historically loose, yet there are few signs of excess in the financial system. U.S. stocks have also been resilient against yield curve inversions in the past: Historically, the S&amp;P 500 Index has rallied an average of 22% from the first inversion to the eventual economic peak.\n\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re not convinced that this yield curve inversion is a sign of imminent recession,\u201d said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cThe U.S. labor market is at full employment, healthy wage growth is fueling strong consumer activity, and corporate profits are at record levels.\u201d\n\n&gt; **Global Perspective**\n\n&gt; Of course, recessions can be self-fulfilling prophecies of market sentiment, and we take that risk seriously. However, it\u2019s a curious time for global fixed income right now, and Treasury yields have been weighed down by intense global buying pressure amid ultra-low sovereign debt yields elsewhere. Because of this, we think the yield curve\u2019s shape has been driven more by technical factors than domestic economic weakness.\n\n&gt; **Monetary Policy Remains Too Tight**\n\n&gt; This yield curve inversion sends an important signal to Federal Reserve (Fed) policymakers. U.S. monetary policy is clearly still too tight, even after last month\u2019s 25 basis point (0.25%) rate cut, given trade uncertainty and signs of slowing global growth. The Fed has promised flexibility, and we expect policymakers to enact one or two more cuts by the end of the year. Without an easier Fed, the U.S. dollar may stay elevated and global buying pressure will continue in Treasuries.\n\n&gt; **What\u2019s Next?**\n\n&gt; We will continue to monitor the yield curve and incoming economic data. For now, we think the current U.S. economic expansion, now in its 11th year, has more room to run.\n\n*****\n\n# A Closer Look at Technical Support\n\n&gt; We continue to believe there is technical support for the S&amp;P 500 Index as discussed in our August 9 blog, and we\u2019re already seeing some signs of the pessimism that is necessary for forming a bottom. The negative sentiment intensified August 14 following the inversion of the yield curve (discussed in our August 14 blog), so today we want to take a closer look at some key levels the LPL Research team is watching.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Va6wqOv.png))**\n\n&gt; First is resistance, or levels that an index or stock may struggle to rise above. Despite Tuesday\u2019s 1.5% gain, the S&amp;P 500 ran right into its 50-day moving average near 2,940. This level also marked the 2018 highs for the market, adding to its significance.\n\n&gt; As for support, or levels at which we think buyers are likely to step into the market, there are three key levels we are watching:\n2,822. The intraday low from August 5 is only about 1% below Wednesday\u2019s close, but it may be viewed by short-term traders as a tactical way to gauge whether we have hit the bottom in this current pullback.\n&gt; 200-day moving average. Currently at 2,796, the 200-day moving average is a closely watched trend indicator that is commonly viewed as either support or resistance, depending on where the index sits in relation to it.\n&gt; 2,740. Perhaps the strongest level of support for the S&amp;P 500 is 2,740. As seen in the LPL Research Chart of the Day, Key Levels for the S&amp;P 500 Index, this benchmark has actually tested 2,740 two times so far this year, but it failed to close below that level either time. 2,740 also happens to be 9.5% below the July highs, right in line with a standard 10% correction.\n&gt; \u201cWe believe a retest of the December lows remains unlikely,\u201d said LPL Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cWe think any decline beyond 10% from recent highs would be excessive, and we would recommend that suitable investors rebalance and add to positions accordingly if the S&amp;P 500 falls that far.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending August 16th, 2019** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Uk2vvn1nWU))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 08.18.19**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QV8fW4qNyzM))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/d6Yxsri.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/2a0nhSW.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/Jsn7DDg.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.19.19 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ofsnX54.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.19.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dE9CtAe.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 8.20.19 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vZcscRa.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 8.20.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Z4fBRxk.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.21.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/LVbGvHb.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.21.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/BT0g37b.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.22.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cO2ZrQa.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.22.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1zibJwF.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.23.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/2eYQngz.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.23.19 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Baidu, Inc. $96.70 \n&gt; **Baidu, Inc.
