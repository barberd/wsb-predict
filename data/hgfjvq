I would like to say that we hear you and your emotions are valid. I also understand that some may have chosen to go to the ~~lifeboats and abandon ship~~ sell Luckin while you still could. Some may say \"~~The Titanic broke apart into two pieces an hour ago in a horrific split in which the tail end of the ship rose out of the water and snapped in two as people fell, impaling themselves on the ship or into the icy churning waters of the Atlantic.~~ Luckin's stock has had no future in US exchanges since the original fraud report and any hope they would be able to stay on the US markets long enough to regain their financial control is idiocy.\" Now, I say to stay the course. ~~The Titanic~~ Luckin is fundamentally strong. It is the largest ~~passenger vessel at sea~~ coffee chain in China and even without the ~~tail end of the vessel~~ the flubbed amount of money, we can move forward. In fact, at this very moment, ~~the Titanic is moving forward into the depths of the ocean with thousands of our fellow passengers~~ millions of Chinese consumers are ordering their coffee through Luckin.\n\nThe crew minus the ~~few we have lost~~ CEO and CFO are fully confident that we can continue our journey successfully as ~~a ship~~ Asias most aggressive growth stock. We will seek opportunity to ~~reach our destination~~ relist in the US in the future.\n\nThank you for your patience,\n\n~~Captain Edward Smith~~ Dr. Jinyi Guo\n\n~~Captain of the RMS Titanic~~ SVP of Supply Chain who is now also emergency CEO because all the frat bros at the C-level were implicated and I was only safe because I am a logistics nerd and a total square who wasn't in on the deception cause I didn't snort enough coke with \"the boys\" to be cool", "created_utc": 1593203957.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hgfjvq/a_message_from_the_captain_of_the_titanic_ceo_of/", "is_self": true}
