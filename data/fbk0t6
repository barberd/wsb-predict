They got a .01 Price/Revenue compared to an industry average of .96, and they\u2019re priced like they\u2019re going broke even tho they turn an operating profit and consistently make debt payments. They have a beta of over 4, so just buying a metric fuck ton of their stock feels like you\u2019re trading options. They were up 15% on Friday alone, and currently trade around $2.11\n\nLONG YRCW YOU AUTISTS", "created_utc": 1583014276, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fbk0t6/stonk_picks_yrcw/", "is_self": true}
