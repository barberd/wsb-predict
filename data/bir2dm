{"id": "bir2dm", "title": "$CHGG Earnings DD BULLISH", "selftext": "A couple of weeks ago I posted a chegg bullish chegg dd. Even without earnings chegg went up ~7%.\n\nLike I said before the source of my bullish sentiment is chegg shutting down websites such as text sheet and lit answers that were stealing cheggs answers.\n\nSince these actions I\u2019ve noticed an increase of chegg use at my school and this is definitely not based on any data just observation, definitely not susceptible to confirmation bias.\n\nSo this totally unbiased observation will clearly apply nationwide leading to crazy subscriptions increase like 20%. Definitely disnt just make that number up. Also chegg has beat their expected earnings 100% of the time for the past 2 years.\n\nSo overall I see $CHEGG rising ~%10 by tomorrow, so it\u2019s a good opportunity to buy rn that there\u2019s a dip before earnings.\n\nBased on this solid logic, I have invested all my lives savings ~9k on chegg, very confident that this can\u2019t go tits up.", "created_utc": 1556553148, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bir2dm/chgg_earnings_dd_bullish/", "is_self": true}
