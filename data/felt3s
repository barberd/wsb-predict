If you check the IV (Implied volatility), it\u2019s at is highest, meaning that the market is VERY VOLATILE (meaning it goes up and/or down aggressively and often). Which is what it makes a contract worth either more or less. \n\nIf you\u2019re an investor you should be buying regular stonks not options, because IV will crush the price on your calls (assuming you\u2019re smart). \n\nFor the lazy people that go to the comments; LOOK UP IV CRUSHER on YouTube and thank me later.", "created_utc": 1583535129.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/felt3s/why_youll_lose_money_buying_options_rn/", "is_self": true}
