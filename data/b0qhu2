Airbus gets revenge by infiltrating Boeing with an insider who either inserted a faulty code and/or purposely approved a faulty inspection, leading to the two plane crashes. \n\nResult: The world loses trust in Boeing and cancels their orders for their small-mid size jets and Airbus gets revenge and more customers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust look at the stocks of both companies. **It is no coincidence** that Boeing has two plane crashes in a 6 months period immediately after the Boeing scheme against Airbus.", "created_utc": 1552506924, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b0qhu2/boeing_737_max_8_crashes_were_an_inside_job_from/", "is_self": true}
