{"id": "gkg93r", "title": "Why I'm buying DAL", "selftext": "People will one day want to fly again. I know I am already planning future trips (with no specific dates). The odds that all airlines go bankrupt and new ones rising is slim. My DD is that I have talked to 4 people about their cancelled flights experience. Here're the general summary.\n\n* person A - Sun Country airlines: was offered a voucher that must be used by EOY, he is pissed. He had to wait on the phone for over an hour twice. \n* person B - Frontier airlines: was given a voucher that has to be used by November or something? They said they tried calling in to complain and sat on the phone for about 45 minutes waiting and decided it wasn't worth it.\n* person C/D - Delta Airlines: given a voucher, both called in to delta and got reimbursed by telling them they didnt have to ability to travel this year. Both were satisfied.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUs 5 (4 + me) talk regularly and used to frequently deal shop for flights. All of us basically came to the conclusion we are only flying delta the rest of our lives. They are consistent with flights being on time and compensate the way you would expect if anything unexpected happens. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn addition to this my mother also told me over the winter that delta gave her free drinks when she wasn't expecting it and that she will be exclusively using delta for the rest of her life. she loves alcohol. Don't bet against my mom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat is 6 data points more than I usually use have when I gamble on a company, so pretty good DD in my mind. So that being said, I am buying calls as far out as RH will let me with the assumption that when this pandemic passes, delta will come out ahead with at least 3 new onlyfans, and 2 continued onlyfans.", "created_utc": 1589572521.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gkg93r/why_im_buying_dal/", "is_self": true}
