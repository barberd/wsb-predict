Blizzard being a part of Activision has sunk quite low in recent years, dwindling subscription numbers are a part of that problem along with a whole host of other issues at blizzard but none of those fucking matter because...\n\nOn August 27, Blizzard will be launching the long awaited Classic WoW server, this will be a remake of the game in it's original 2004 state.\n\nTo this you might scoff and say \"Remakes are released every year 647, who cares it's just another cash grab.\" or \"There have been private servers out forever who the fuck is gonna play that?\"\n\nThe normies don't run that private server shit.\n\nMark my words this will be the single largest revenue producing remake that we will have seen to date. To give you some context when Runescape released it's Old school server the active subscription number shot up and there are more people paying for and playing OSRS than the modern RS3.\n\nActivision is going to zoom past 50 even if everyone unsubscribed after a month the initial hype will do what apex legends did to blizzards stock,, let's get them tendies.\n\nNow someone teach me how the fuck I make a call for the 30th on Questrade so I can donate my paycheque to the market.", "created_utc": 1563729348, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cg1ewd/atvi_and_the_golden_nostalgia/", "is_self": true}
