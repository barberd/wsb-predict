So I went ahead and bought the regular April expiration on the 17th at a more reasonable strike. The 2 extra weeks are worth the safety premium.  Parents aren't taking their kids to Corona land when the government has shut down most locations.  \n\nTLDR: Long April 10 puts.", "created_utc": 1585603618.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frzmtt/april_play_puts/", "is_self": true}
