Your entire portfolio can\u2019t consist $0.01 OTM puts on stock that\u2019s at a 52 week high. And that $0.50 OTM call at +100% is no better than that $10.00 ITM call at +10%. Let me break it down for you, in case your negative cash flow hasn\u2019t already made it clear. You won\u2019t end up with that fitness model on Instagram and that tendy ain\u2019t gonna print. Imagine this:\n\nITM is the girl that you met in Sunday school, long ago. She adores you, she wants to talk about a future together, and if all goes well, baring any fuckery the Universe wants to throw at you, the two of you could probably get married and have a good life. But you, with that Algebra 2 certificate you obtained through Khan Academy, think you could do better. ITM is missing that certain \u201cJenny say quad\u201d you so long for.\n\nI know what you are thinking, but OTM is not the girl. OTM is the girl that you\u2019re willing to risk it all for, and in doing so, bring shame to your family. You know what I\u2019m talking about. OTM is the free-spirit hanging underneath the boardwalk at the beach. OTM has weed, PINK\u2122\ufe0f booty shorts, daddy problems and a warrant. OTM is fine as fuuuuck, boi, and you\u2019re wrapped around her finger cause you cant get this excitement, this type of carelessness back in Nebraska, corn boy.\n\nFor those of you who only buy OTM options cause you\u2019re chasing the big one, and doing so with with little success, does this imagery explain why you can never stay on the positive side of even? It\u2019s cause you\u2019re chasing dirty OTM girls who like bad boys, and you\u2019re not a bad boy. You\u2019re a Redditor with a \u201cdank memes\u201d folder on your desktop. Sure, you can chase OTMs at $0.01 per contract and you might get lucky a handful of times but come age 40, you won\u2019t have anything to show for it cause OTM\u2019s brat of a 6yr son used your profits on another Fortnite micro-transaction. Oh btw, OTM girl doesn\u2019t know who the father is, but she\u2019s positive it isn\u2019t you, Redditor.\n\nSo ask yourself, what do you want from each of these girls? Your answer should be, \u201cI want her to make me money and I also don\u2019t want to pay child support for someone else\u2019s kid.\u201d Now think about which girl can give you the best chance at this. Hint: it\u2019s not OTM. \n\nOTM\u2019s only value is what you see in her, through your Rose tinted glasses. It would be nice if OTM could get a job and help with the utilities, but she needs to pass the drug test first and since you were babysitting her kid last night, you know that her and her psycho best friend didn\u2019t make it home till 4am. Not looking good. OTM doesn\u2019t want to work, OTM wants to marry a 90yr millionaire and push his adult children out of the will right before he expires. \n\nITM, excuse me Dr. ITM, just obtained her dual PhD in economics and mathematics. She\u2019ll be making more $ in an hour at that investment firm on Wall St than you do in week working as \u201cFinancial Analyst I\u201d at Costo, corn boy. She\u2019s a hotdog commodity now, and you should have valued her when you had the chance, Redditor. Should have taken that likely 5% cause she could have turned it into $10 mil so you can both retire in your 30s.\n\nSo think about it, champ. Why have you been chasing dirty OTM options? Is it because there is a greater potential profit margin/excitement? Is it because you can only afford the $0.38 OTM contract and not the $20.40 ITM contract? Is it because you did some top-level due diligence and you know OTM is going to kick that addiction? Or it is because you had money to YOLO on the slim chance it would work out, and you were comfortable losing money even if it didn\u2019t? If it\u2019s one of the latter two, move on and remember me, your dad, when that gamble finally does pay off. \n\nIf it\u2019s because of one of the other reasons, maybe you need to try a new strategy. Instead of chasing 1000% returns on that $0.01 OTM option, lock in that 5, 15, 20% return on that ITM option. Don\u2019t chase God status, chase what can be easier money. Sure, you might pay a steep premium for ITM, but that premium is the engagement ring your wife dreamed of, which she\u2019ll forget about entirely when she wakes up on Christmas morning to a new Tesla model X in your driveway, bought with those juicy ITM tendies. Now buy another ITM, and another, and another, then next Christmas buy her a second house, this one on Lake Como. And when George Clooney invites you two over for Nespresso, delightfully oblige. You\u2019d be surprised at how quickly 5% adds up when reinvested again and again.\n\nC\u2019mon champ, OTM options aren\u2019t bad and I\u2019m not saying to stay away from them entirely, they\u2019re just a little dirty that\u2019s all. Don\u2019t be surprised when it doesn\u2019t pan out.  And conversely, I\u2019m not saying ITM options are all good either. They\u2019ll fuck you over just as hard, hopefully just less often. \n\nThe point is, I see too many people in this sub complaining that their OTM put expired worthless cause SPY didn\u2019t fall -30% in two days, or that they can\u2019t afford SPY ITM for $20.10 so they bought SPY OTM for $1.00. \n\nDon\u2019t bet your allowance on OTM options that require huge swings in the underlying share price and if you can\u2019t afford ITM for company A, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you have to go OTM. You can find a company X,Y, or Z that has an equally attractive ITM option that you CAN afford. Remember OTM is cheaper, because it\u2019s literally worthless until it\u2019s not. \n\n\nPositions so I don\u2019t get banned:\n\nTLT $157.5p 4/17\nDIS $80p 4/17\nIMAX $10p 4/17\nDIS $95c 1/1/22\n\nToodaloo, mothafuckas", "created_utc": 1585025531.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fnz7kb/otm_options_are_not_wife_material_no_matter_how/", "is_self": true}
