Do this.", "selftext": "**Do this one trick and Robinhood will hate you forever!**\n\nOk so after seeing you all cry over Robinhood's incompetence I started to remember in how many other ways rh fucks us right in the ass. While pondering, I came up with this: \"Oh right, every time I place a buy order that initially had no bid, 100  bids come out of nowhere before mine\". We all know this is Robinhood's gay partners who get to lick our orders and replicate them before ours even gets sent. So check this out.\n\nTo do this trick you will need **two brokerage accounts**: 1 with Robinhood(**This is required**) and one with any other brokerage. So here are the steps.\n\n1- Place a buy order**(Just 1**) on a crazy OTM option that you know will never happen. Preferably a 0.01 contract so it doesn't hurt you too bad.\n\n2- Now all of Robinhood's boyfriends will run and place the same order to get your tendies.\n\n3- (This is where you fuck them right in the ass). You will sell them all of those options from your **other brokerage account.**\n\n4-Now you just lost a small amount in your RH account(not like you had more than a dollar left after the massive fuck they gave you) but they bought your stupid options thinking they're slick.\n\n5- Repeat until you think they lost enough money!\n\nI's just a small amount of money but it adds up and before they notice they'll probably have lost a shit ton of money and they'll likely stop doing it(which means no more money for RH) and you made some pennies on your real account.\n\nAnd there you go. If you are butt hurt from RH's massive gangbang I hope this helps you deal with it.\n\n**Disclaimer: I have not tried this but sounds like it can't go tits up. This is completely theoretical and this post was made for pure entertainment. I do not recommend doing this under any circumstances.**", "created_utc": 1583267691, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fd10ih/hate_robinhood_do_this/", "is_self": true}
