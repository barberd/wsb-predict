It is an REIT that is mostly known for private prisons. On June 17 CXW suspended it's hefty dividend and dropped from $12.52 to $10.43.\n\nGEO is a similar REIT that owns private prisons and halfway houses. They are currently trading for $12.10. They have floated the idea of reducing their dividend1, and financially are very similar to CXW in terms of debt, assets, what have you.\n\nI think if they do get rid of dividend, it will be between July 7th and 16th. Like core civic, they have to do it before the ex-dividend date, which is July 17th at the earliest (couldn't find exact dates, using historical numbers). I expect them to do so. They need cash.\n\nFor these reasons, I think 12$ and 11$ 7/17 puts are a good buy. I might buy some if GEO goes up tomorrow. When they suspend their dividend, I expect them to go down to the low 10$ mark. Maybe less if Congress or Biden complains about private prisons before then. Anyway, that's my DD", "created_utc": 1592535900.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hbsvlp/a_tale_of_two_prisons_and_why_i_think_717_geo/", "is_self": true}
