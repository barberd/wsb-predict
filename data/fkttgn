{"id": "fkttgn", "title": "Snap on degen DD", "selftext": "Laziest most degenerate DD. I work in a shop, in *canada* and as of today our snap on rep says he won\u2019t be by for a month *atleast* keep in mind that this is how Snap On does most of their business, of course they sell online but tool trucks are a huge part of their business. Couple this with the fact that a ton of their stuff is made in the USA, and will soon face factory shut downs, I think this stock has a ways to fall yet. \n\nAlso, if a recession is coming, Snap on will struggle solely because of how expensive they are. No ones going to be paying $328 for a 12 piece socket set when they\u2019re struggling to make ends meet. \n\nTL;DR No factories, no tool trucks, expensive *luxury* tools. \n\nSNA 80p 05/15 though I\u2019ll wait for the Friday rally", "created_utc": 1584553995.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkttgn/snap_on_degen_dd/", "is_self": true}
