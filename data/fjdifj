Look like good 'ol Pmtiggobitties has it. \n\nMother informed me her friend's husband has it (he had a bad cough and fever earlier this week and went to the hospital). They were in close contact a week ago and my family locked down this weekend. Then the call came in a few minutes ago confirming he had the WuFlu. Holy balls. \n\nThis shit spreads quick. Everyone in my family has a grim fucking look on their face.\n\nNo symptoms as of yet. If drive thru testing happens I'll go get checked out.  \n\nOtherwise, Puts on everything.\n\n\nEdit: RIP to my Mother for being Granny Autist that didn't listen when I told her stay home.\n\nEdit 2: AAL $8 3/20 , DAL $26 3/20 , DIS $70 3/20 Puts on Puts MuthaFuckas", "created_utc": 1584325808.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjdifj/i_might_have_the_beer_flu/", "is_self": true}
