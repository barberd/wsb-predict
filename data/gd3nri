{"id": "gd3nri", "title": "The Psychology of Fear: Why a big gay short isn't coming anytime soon", "selftext": "I'm reading increased traffic that there's another big crash on the horizon. Let me be perfectly clear to you greedy ratfucks hoping to print your $3 puts on the same trick.\n\nThe market crash in march was on the back of fear and uncertainty. There was no precedent, no plan for the economy. The market  responded to a deep shock to the established market reality and cratered. \n\nFear in human psychology has diminishing returns as we adapt to a new situation. We fear what we don't know, but as we grapple with a situation, we learn to adapt, and as we learn, we set in place plans and strategies. For covid, we now have those plans in place. We have a timeline to a vaccine, drugs coming online to reduce severity, a pathway to at least limited economic re-opening. People can see the way forward. We have for the most part accepted the reality of our new situation as the new normal.\n\nThe  market in turn is now awake to the crisis, so you're going to see diminishing  returns on the same type of bad news. We expect bad news because it is part of the new normal. We now also have a precedent of resistance points to overcome all the way back down from the rally. It's going to take something  completely unexpected and horrific to get another severe drop. To get people panicking again, it's going to have to come out of left field. Something they haven't already mentally price into, like suddenly revealing your anus on social media.  \n\nTo get the  same level of collapse, we are going to need to see more news that is  equally as shocking as the original covid outbreak to the existing market. Best case bear scenario is a slow bleed as the reality of the possible \\~30% GDP contractions and crushingly low Q2 earnings. \n\nTL:DR - bear scenario - market is going to bleed out, not run off a cliff. Do something unexpected outside of the current expected norm like release anthrax or start a war with china to see further dramatic drops.", "created_utc": 1588561131.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gd3nri/the_psychology_of_fear_why_a_big_gay_short_isnt/", "is_self": true}
