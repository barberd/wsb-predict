{"id": "flgsk1", "title": "Options Greeks for Dummies", "selftext": "**Since a lot of new autists are on here blindly buying options and praying that they make them money. hopefully this helps you lose less money**\n\nLet me make this as *simple* as possible. Options Greeks are dimensions of **risk** for different aspects, such as time, price, volatility blah blah. Here is what they are and how you can use them to make better trades.\n\n**DELTA**\ndomain: price\ndelta is the greek that has the largest influence over the option, it is a reflection of how the options premium will change as the price of the stock changes. For example, if you buy a call option on a stock that costs 100$ with a delta of .35, you can expect the premium of your option to go up 35 cents if the stock goes up 1$ to 101$.\n**DELTA TLDR** delta is the percent risk for the option. multiply it by 100 to get a general percent chance of profit.\n\n**GAMMA**\nGamma is the derivative of Delta , or the instantaneous rate of change for each consecutive increase or decrease in stock price relative to the option. gamma is to delta as acceleration is to velocity in your high school physics class. Basically, GAMMA is **NOT** linear.\nFor example, you have a stock that costs 100$ with a delta of .35 and a gamma of .05. if the stock goes up 1$, the premium will go up 35 cents and delta will go up to .40, meaning the next 1$ increase will increase the premium 40 cents instead of 35 cents.\n**GAMMA TLDR** The derivative of delta, how much delta will change as price increases or decreases.\n\n**THETA**\ntheta is the domain of time, more specifically the rate of decay. Pay extra attention to theta you autistic fucks because this is the reason you keep losing all your money. Theta is the greek that represents how much your option will decrease every day that passes where your option does not move closer in the money. theta increases as expiration gets closer, so when you buy your option 50% out of the money that expires next week, theta cucked you ten times harder than that same option expiring in 6 months.\nFor example, your option costs 1.80, and has a theta of .1, \nthis is what your premium will look like as you get theta cucked:\nDay 1: *1.8\nDay 2: *1.7\nDay 3: *1.6\nyou get the point.\n**THETA TLDR** HIGH THETA IS BAD FOR OPTION BUYER AND VERY GOOD FOR OPTION SELLER. A THETA CLOSER TO 1 MEANS YOU WILL ALMOST 100% LOSE EVERYTHING.\n\n**VEGA**\nVegas domain is implied volatility. it represents how your option will be influenced by 1% increase or decrease in IV. Say you have an option that cost 1$, with a vega of .05, if the IV goes up 1%, the option will go up to 1.05. NOTICE in the current conditions IV is in the hundreds of percent for everything. SO WHEN THIS SHIT STABILIZES YOUR OPTIONS WILL GET DESTROYED BY VEGA!!\n**VEGA TLDR** Implied Volatilities influence over option price. increase in IV is good for buyers and bad for sellers, and vise versa. so in general, low IV options are far more favorable for a buyer.\n\n**RHO**\nrho is the domain over interest rates. for newbies, this shit is the least important greek by far, but basically it shows how much your premium will increase or decrease as interest rates go up or down.\n\n**TLDR**\noptions greeks are used to analyze how various factors such as time, price, volatility, and interest rates will influence the premium on your option. They are crucial for responsible gambling as they can be used to almost immediately assess the risk the option you are buying or selling has, along with the actual potential for profit.\n**Use this information to not lose all your money** I will try to answer questions but probably not.\n\n**TLDR, TLDR** \n[this chads comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flgsk1/options_greeks_for_dummies/fkyhsdk/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)", "created_utc": 1584648491.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flgsk1/options_greeks_for_dummies/", "is_self": true}
