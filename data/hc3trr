{"id": "hc3trr", "title": "Quadruple Witching today", "selftext": "FYI for newbies out there:\n\n\"Transactions in stocks spiked amid a quarterly event known as  quadruple witching, when options and futures on indexes and equities  expire. During the first 15 minutes of trading, volume on the S&P  500 was about 70% higher than the average for that time of day over the  past 30 sessions.\n\nQuadruple witching usually coincides with a re-balancing of  major indexes such as the S&P 500 and can spark some of the busiest  trading days of the year. While the global market turmoil in March  prompted S&P Dow Jones Indices to postpone the last re-balancing, the quadruple witching alone was enough to trigger a volume surge.\n\n. . .\n\nIf history is any guide, investors may need to get ready for a market  pullback or a wider trading range, McElligott \\[from RBC\\] warned. Since 1994, the  options expiration in June has seen stocks falling 88% of the time over  the following week, with the S&P 500 sliding 1.2% on average, the  firm\u2019s data showed.\"\n\nSOURCE:  [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-18/quadruple-witching-set-to-add-fuel-to-month-of-stock-turbulence?srnd=premium](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-18/quadruple-witching-set-to-add-fuel-to-month-of-stock-turbulence?srnd=premium)\n\nNote that a ton of the expiring hedges were purchased in March/April and are way OTM now, so this will be a very light gamma witching day.\n\nCheers!", "created_utc": 1592584223.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hc3trr/quadruple_witching_today/", "is_self": true}
