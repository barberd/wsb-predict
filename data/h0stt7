{"id": "h0stt7", "title": "Question about the NKLAW exercise period", "selftext": "The exercise period for the NKLA warrants begins 30 days after the merge, which I believe makes the date July 3rd?  I'm holding 276 warrants (@ \\~7.50), I was wondering if it might be best to just sell the warrants before the exercise period.\n\nI'm worried that everyone is going to exercise their warrants and sell at immediately which will drive the price of the stock way down.  Would it be a good idea to sell the warrants a week beforehand (once it's gotten much closer to the stock price), then buy NKLA once the stock falls around early July?\n\nI'm really new to this shit so I'd appreciate any advice.\n\nThanks", "created_utc": 1591853075.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h0stt7/question_about_the_nklaw_exercise_period/", "is_self": true}
