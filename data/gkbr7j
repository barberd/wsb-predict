I went yesterday evening and it was packed. If this isn't bullish I am not sure what would be: [https://preview.redd.it/nzemhm5jost41.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=64a3990a3fe1a52d085b08a5edd4c06d78a32576](https://preview.redd.it/nzemhm5jost41.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=64a3990a3fe1a52d085b08a5edd4c06d78a32576)\n\nI prefer Lowe's a bit because it seems to be flying under the radar and it's a tad cheaper. But both are playable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJoyy ($YY make sure you use **YY ticker**. Don't be autistic, there is another company with ticker JOYY). It's under the radar because it's chines but streaming traffic seems to have doubled. Bigo is one of their streaming services which according to google play store has risen to #2 in terms of gross revenue. Just second to Facebook.  Seems that they have started doing live games, that are driving this trend. This is a bet that I have **high conviction** for.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**DocuSign** ($Docu) has been signing up firms that need documents signed from home. You can easily sign legal documents using a link sent to you via email. Guess the best use of their services? Remote work. This is **my biggest bet**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Take-two**: There is a lot of discussion here about this. **GTA** and the associated micro transactions seem to be the play. I like it enough to buy the stock but not enough to buy calls. GTA is awesome and has seen a huge surge in gameplay. Reports earnings middle of next week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**NVIDIA**: They have sold a ton of GPUs to gamers. They are operating at max capacity per some reports. Solid company. My only hesitation is that it is too expensive. You may want to play the run up to the earnings.", "created_utc": 1589558263.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gkbr7j/dd_six_stocks_that_report_in_the_next_two_weeks/", "is_self": true}
