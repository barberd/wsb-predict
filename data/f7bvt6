Now the last 3 quarterly earnings beat expextations significantly and it is highly likely that they will ON MONDAY post their first profitable quarter, being no in net loss. To add to the bonertown, they will post their full year 2019 data and 2020 forecast - publicly accessible for any retard to dial in - expect GOOD news.\n\nLooking at the option pricing there is a huge implied volatility. For all the millenials in here this means there will be a major price movement expected and I'm rdy with my bull balls and calls. \n\nThe earnings publish on Monday before open and I'm in with two plays at $22 short term calls and $26 long term calls.\n\n\"The bull thesis on bio-pharmaceutical company\u00a0Amarin\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMRN) for 2020 is pretty simple.

In other words, there\u2019s good reason why Amarin stock could head higher.\"", "created_utc": 1582295512, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7bvt6/amrn_earnings_play_67_upside_to_price_target/", "is_self": true}
