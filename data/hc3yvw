Game changer for In-App advertising?", "selftext": "Apple are getting ready for a mobile advertising land grab on $ZNGA, $FB, $SNAP, $TTD, Criteo, Rubicon Project and LiveRamp\n\nhttps://www.adweek.com/programmatic/apple-may-call-time-on-idfa-so-whats-next-for-in-app-advertising/\n\nApple is widely expected to make a policy announcement over its mobile ad targeting tool at it\u2019s developer conference, WWDC, starting next Monday 6/22.\n\nPeople in the know are expecting Apple to revoke the IDFA (Identity for Advertisers), which would have a tectonic impact on the $45 billion in-app advertising market. \n\nThe move would follow suit with Apple\u2019s recent policy changes and tracking restrictions for the Safari browser (link: https://www.adweek.com/programmatic/apples-cookie-blocking-update-causes-publishers-more-pain/ ). \n\nApple\u2019s primary reasoning is likely to be a user centric, privacy-by-design approach, however the move would also lead to Apple \u201ctaking back control\u201d over in-app mobile advertising across iOS devices. \n\nAccording to Adjust, the mobile ad specialist: \n\u201cThe Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) is a random device identifier assigned by Apple to a user's device. Advertisers use this to track data so they can deliver customized advertising. The IDFA is used for tracking and identifying a user (without revealing personal information), allowing advertisers to access aggregated data.\nThe aggregated data can then be used to discover information such as which in-app events a user triggers. The IDFA can also identify when users interact with a mobile advertising campaign, provided the channel offers IDFA tracking and the advertiser tracks users who interact with as successfully. If this occurs, the IDFA can identify whether specific users click an advert for payment and attribution purposes.\u201d (link: https://www.adjust.com/glossary/idfa/) \n\nIDFA is a persistent identifier that can be accessed by both first parties, such as app developers, and their monetization partners. Some argue that this method of tracking users is much more invasive than a third-party cookie, and withdrawing it as a way to identify iPhone users would significantly impact in-app mobile advertising.\n\nThis could mean that Apple controls revenue streams for app publishers who rely on IDFA like $ZNGA (ie. companies who generate passive revenue from programmatic advertising and don\u2019t often have an alternative ID like logged in email address data). Apple would have an advantage over smaller,  publisher focussed AdTech companies like Rubicon Project and even bigger players like $FB with the Facebook Audience Network (FAN). \n\nApple would dominate app monetization, which is currently a fragmented space filled with monetization AdTech partners taking 5% - 15% of revenue. As competition decreases, Apple\u2019s revenue share could increase to c. 30%, taking dollars out of the pockets of app publishers and AdTech. \n\nApple\u2019s role as gate keeper with control over IDs would heavily impact companies that rely on IDFAs as part of their proprietary identity graphs. These include media buying companies like The Trade Desk $TTD and Criteo, along with Identity Data specialists like LiveRamp.\n\nThe media buying companies would lose access to a persistent ID, which reduces their capability to gather and store targeting data along with their ability to optimize for performance & ROI. They would also end up paying inflated prices if Apple is the primary source of media in a less competitive market. Advertisers would likely get more efficient pricing, reliable targeting and attribution by going direct to Apple. \n\nFinally, Apple would control attribution. Tracking which people see an ad and convert (via IDFAs) is really important for companies like Facebook $FB and $SNAP to prove the effectiveness of their ads, especially for app advertisers who are driving downloads & installs. Most measurement is done by companies like AppsFlyer, Tune or Kochava, using IDFAs. \nWithout the ID, attribution would rely on logged in data like hashed email addresses. \n\nWhilst some app publishers can incentivize people to log in and share data, many apps don\u2019t have a compelling reason for a customer to log in. Think about casual gaming or infrequently used utility apps. \n\nEven for Facebook, Snap, Twitter, Pinterest etc. there would need to be new investment / R&D to create attribution workflows with Apple, or to create safe spaces for brands & platforms to share anonymized hashed emails. \n\nSome mobile / advertising context from Q1 2020:\n\nRubicon Project mobile revenue was $21m, 58% of their $36.3m total revenue. \n\n$FB generates almost all of its revenue from advertising. In Q1 2020 $17.44 bn out of $17.74 bn came from ads. \n\n$TTD is generating most of its notable growth from mobile. \nTotal Mobile (in-app, video, and web) spend grew 38% from Q12019 to Q12020. \nMobile Video spend grew 74% from Q12019 to Q12020. \nMobile In-App spend grew 55% from Q12019 to Q12020\n\nGoogle made a similar announcement on 13th January, about killing off 3rd party cookies in Chrome, which are used for targeting and tracking. (Link: https://www.google.com/amp/s/digiday.com/media/google-plans-kill-off-third-party-cookies-chrome-within-2-years/amp/) \n\nFollowing Google\u2019s announcement, by the end of Jan 20:\n\n-  Criteo slid around 20%, dropping 30% rapidly and then recovering temporarily. \n\n- LiveRamp slid around 10%, despite being one of the stronger plays for offsetting reliance on cookies. Their play is weaker without persistent IDs like IDFAs\n\n- TTD got off lightly, sliding around 8% by the end of Jan. Wall Street has bought the story that TTD are a connected TV company but in reality, most of their advertising revenue is still mobile and desktop, relying of cookies and IDFAs for targeting.\n\nConsidering Chrome browser wouldn\u2019t really impact FB, SNAP, Zynga etc, I expect more media, AdTech and mobile publishers to get caught up by Apple\u2019s announcement.", "created_utc": 1592584695.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hc3yvw/apple_may_call_time_on_idfa_data_game_changer_for/", "is_self": true}
