Did the algos all PM each other over Christmas and decide to buy when everyone else is still hungover? Did RenTech, Citadel and AQR reprogram their code to buy? Did all the big funds use the media companies they own to say \"Bear market, recession incoming!\" and then when it hit that -20% level just buy everything except SNAP? Wasn't the actual selloff caused by some naughty algos selling an ETF too quickly?", "created_utc": 1577080766, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eegi7m/was_the_reversal_dec_26_2018_caused_by_algos/", "is_self": true}
