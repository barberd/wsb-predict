{"id": "fewxp7", "title": "Short Uber", "selftext": "Uber market cap is absurd at 55B.  It could easily be cut in half and still be ridiculously valued.\n\nWeak business model/moat.  No pricing power.  If they ever become meaningfully profitable in many many years, autonomy or semi-autononmy will be mainstream.   There are many on going and to come legal battles - employee vs contractor and benefits etc..   \n\nMost Uber drivers I talk to are very negative towards Uber and the pay.  And I suspect most drivers do not do the math on how much they actually make when u factor things such as their time, vehicle maintenance \\ depreciation\\gas\\Insurance.   My napkin math has em lucky to make minimum wage assuming they are not idle.\n\nBig time ompetition on the way, such as Tesla, waymo which will leave Uber in the dust.  Companies like door dash, grub can easily expand into ride hailing as they have the tech , software/app and user base.    \n\nCustomers are not loyal to Uber.  When Lyft came to my city, I immediately downloaded app and now choose based on the lower rate (who is giving me the better promotion).  The cheaper fee will win.\n\nI regularly get promos for Uber and Lyft.  On a Friday night (yesterday) , Lyft priced a typical 5$ ride for 00.58 cents 'shared' and FREE for 'Shared saver'.   Correct, I said 'Free' And my city has no Corona euphoria at the moment.\n\nNow on top of all that, the Carona virus will hit Uber big time as most events and airports trips are cancelled as well as many folks working from home.  This is where they make most of their revenue, ecpecially w surge pricing.  I suspect their target of profit (a meaningless amount obviously) will not happen in Q4 is planned.\n\n\nPS. Thank you Uber/Lyft shareholders for subsidizing my rides.   \ud83c\udf7b\n\nTLDR:. June 30$ Puts (opened 3 weeks ago).
