{"id": "fslqzm", "title": "The sell off has been cushioned by the fed unlimited QE.", "selftext": "The liquidity of the market and the uncertainty of the future has pushed the markets to plummet more than 35% in just 1 month of trading. The end of this quarter marks the worst quarter in the history of this country. We are expecting a GDP drop of 9% in Q1, 34% in Q2, and then a substantial rebound in Q3. With the infusion of QE by the fed, we are seeing an infusion of capital that eases liquidity concerns and cushions the volatility of the markets. The fed is prepared to enact unlimited QE for as long as it is necessary to cushion the fall and signal to all that it\u2019s OK we will get through this and we will persevere. While there is still room to fall in the near term, a recession is inevitable, and we have still not returned to the mean, there is hope on the horizon that we will recover and continue our journey to all time highs. The insane volatility that occurred prior to the QE announcement is over and while the markets may slowly ease lower over multiple months, the 5-10% daily moves will be extremely rare to see.\n\n6/19 SPY 280 C", "created_utc": 1585690083.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fslqzm/the_sell_off_has_been_cushioned_by_the_fed/", "is_self": true}
