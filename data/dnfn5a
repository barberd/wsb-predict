{"id": "dnfn5a", "title": "$AMD theorycraft, $INTC comeback", "selftext": "I have a theory about AMD beating Intel to 7nm chip design. I\u2019m not a computer engineer, but I am a computer scientist and understand the basics on the physical side. \n\nQuantum tunneling is an issue that occurs at significant effect at 7nm and below transistor distance.\n\nRelated info:\n\nhttps://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/02/intel-forges-ahead-to-10nm-will-move-away-from-silicon-at-7nm/\n\nhttps://semiengineering.com/quantum-effects-at-7-5nm/\n\nMy question is: why is intel taking longer to finish their version? They have dominated the market with scheduled releases for years and have more money.\n\nDid AMD take a risk that Intel didn\u2019t which could result in future issues? Intel had more backlash from spectre/meltdown due to their parchitecture design. Maybe they are being smart about this.\n\ntldr: AMD puts for 4/20 when their chips are discovered to have flaws.
