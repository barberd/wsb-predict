{"id": "gqtor3", "title": "$HAL to the fucking moon, bet on America and you can't go tits up. One of the greatest American companies (at one time the biggest employer in America) has been beaten down 50%!! America might get beat down BUT IT NEVER STAYS DOWN", "selftext": "Sometimes America gets beaten down, but we never lose. We got the #1 COVID death count don't forget! Those Italian fuckers thought they could be #1, but no, America is always #1.\n\nDisclosure: I own stock, buy calls, and sell puts on $HAL. (Because I have a big brain)\n\nWeekly Lotto Pick: HAL $14 Call 6/5 EXP - 157 BUYS - https://imgur.com/s3Tq753 - https://imgur.com/JetYEOE\n\nHere is why I LOVE this play\n\nIntro/warning: First let me start by say on the technical charts it might be smart to wait for a slight pull back, even the oil bulls are thinking their will be a pull back. (Also AI predicts oil is good to short right now) However... I disagree and I have a lot of data behind me... Let's dive in boys...  \n\n\nDeeeeep Diiiive\n\n1. Right company. Right time. Downstream oil companies like HAL get paid to slow down, shut off, turn up, and restart oil wells. So when production was cut they we're profiting. At the same time they we're aggressively cutting cost and already have a very healthy balance sheet, over a 2.2 assets to debt ratio. They are healthy and in a position to take advantage of the volatility in the oil industry. They are a healthy American company that has been beaten down 54% more than average. It was even worse before but has been making a steady come back. The date points to signs of a $40-$50/b crude oil price. This isn't directly correlated to the price of $HAL, HOWEVER this is very bullish for them and will add to their quick rise over the next 2-6 weeks. \n\n2.  The price of crude oil futures as of 05/25/2020 is up 7.1% in the past two trading sessions\n\n5/22: $31.54 https://imgur.com/8nVKZ2a \n5/25: $33.91 https://minnytrees.imgur.com/all/\n\nData to support this position:\n\n1 . The oil tankers that were storing some of the excess oil are being sent to Venezuela to get refined thus lowering the supply of crude oil. \nhttps://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/iranian-fuel-tanker-has-moored-at-venezuelas-el-palito-refinery-tv-2181757\n\n2. Tanker rates are dropping!! (SELL SELL SELL THOSE TANKER STOCKS LMAO) I was never a big fan of the tanker stock play to begin with.. \nhttps://invst.ly/qxau4\n\n3. Chinese are betting on a fast oil recovery, if COVID was a HUGE threat I don\u2019t think the Chinese would be putting big $ into oil, another reason it will pump.  https://oilprice.com/Energy/Oil-Prices/Chinese-Hedge-Funds-Are-Betting-Big-On-An-Oil-Price-Recovery.html\n\n4. Lot\u2019s of small accounts are purchasing HAL and realize it\u2019s undervalued. Here\u2019s the order flow. \nhttps://imgur.com/zrBuf29\n\nIn conclusion.. honestly I could go all fucking day, but I value my time.
