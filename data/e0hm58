I don\u2019t know them but I do know they let you live even after they found out you had an even number of chromosomes-pairs. Miraculously we all grouped together here after \u201cone of us\u201d quit humping the keyboard and shoving the mouse in \u201cfunny\u201d places - and actually started using them. \nEven so, not one of you wanted to retards felt like reaching a saliva covered hand across the aisle and telling us about ICE: the company that fucking owns and operates 12 exchanges. It\u2019s got clearing services, it\u2019s in the OTC market, it\u2019s in the futures market. And it\u2019s already partnering up to host a Bitcoin trading platform.  \n\nOh, also ICE is up 111% in the last 5 years. My fucking bad I almost forgot - probably because \nI\u2019m busy transferring my savings right now. \n\nBefore you all inbreed tonight, I want you to ask yourselves one fucking question: are the financial markets only going to get bigger?
