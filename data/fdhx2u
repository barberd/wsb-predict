The market was pushing all time highs before corona took over. At that moment in time everything was working together in perfect harmony to reach that point, stocks only went up.\n\nNow we have a virus that has cucked our supply chain and China\u2018s economy for several months. What\u2019s happens next, you ask? Other than watching your wife banging her boyfriend and waiting for your god damn balls to drop the market can do two things.\n\nFirst of all, this massive rate cut makes equities a desirable place for billionaires to store their cash. The $69 in your robin hood account won\u2019t do much to affect the markets. The rate cut is a temporary solution that has worked in the past, but will it really work again? The fed just likes to throw money at everything because that\u2019s all they know how to do. They are afraid of the market dropping 3 points, ever.\n\nIF (big mother-FKn IF) the Coronavirus takes over USA that\u2019s when panic and fear will take over and house of cards will implode.\n\nTLDR; market goes up and market goes down... fed doing everything they can to keep it propped and make enticing to buy stocks... if this shit fails then market goes down fastly.\n\nMandatory mods gay.", "created_utc": 1583348780.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fdhx2u/bull_bear_cases_for_the_next_several_months/", "is_self": true}
