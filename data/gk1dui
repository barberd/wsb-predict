{"id": "gk1dui", "title": "A Closer Look at Tesla Q1 Results", "selftext": "So I read the FULL Q1 earnings report for Tesla filed with the SEC and I noticed two interesting things. Tesla included \u201coutstanding sales revenue\u201d from the French state \u00eele-de-France. After running the numbers they reported, it seems that they included around $3B from this french state in their overall earnings. The problem? One... they already included that $3B in their \u201crevenue from sales\u201d section. Thus, it appears tesla created this section from the French state just to add $3B more in to their numbers. Read the whole Q1 file, i can\u2019t believe it. ADDITIONALLY, they report that they made $3B in revenue just from the \u00eele de France region. This includes cities like Versailles and paris. Again, these numbers seem VERY inflated for a region of the country where less than 40% of people own a car and less than 30% of the population drives a car over \u20ac30.000. It seems there is a some loophole in the \u00eele de France region that allows for them to come up to that evaluation, because I find it very very hard to believe.
