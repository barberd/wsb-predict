{"id": "gfkpfh", "title": "Im Keeping LOGI over the Weekend - Next Diamond Hands?", "selftext": "LOGI hasn't missed earnings in two years and fluxes up and down however this time it will not miss earnings again and will be way over expected. October - March sales have increased tremendously due to new products and security cameras etc. March - Now also will do good because selling out of products and Asia has been opened for some time now to make more. I think holding LOGi through the weekend is going to be a good play and will be my diamond hands. If not I will post my losses but so far im currently up 300% since I bought them this morning.\n\nTLDR: 5/15 50c 6/19 60c keeping over weekend also put my whole options trading account into it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aw28il8tcgx41.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c1f6c43f96300bb7de3244da3242f8ebd4afb96", "created_utc": 1588905172.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gfkpfh/im_keeping_logi_over_the_weekend_next_diamond/", "is_self": true}
