{"id": "flhf35", "title": "4/20/2021 Update of the Coronavirus", "selftext": "Update on the Coronavirus 4/20/2021\n\nIt\u2019s been 15 months since the Coronavirus outbreak that started in Wuhan, China. To date, 4 billion people have tested positive and over 293 million people have died. Here is the US, it wiped out almost 1/3 of the population. The global economy finally collapsed just before thanksgiving 2020. Beyond the virus related deaths we had millions more perish after all the riots broke out. We rode out the great coronavirus war in our missile silo community in Nebraska. FDA finally approved GILD\u2019s Remdesivir treatment in November 2020 but it was already too late. The treatment had been proven effective since the beginning and if approved in April 2020, it would have prevented the global collapse. By November 2020, hospitals throughout the world were completely saturated and overwhelmed. Not to mentioned all the doctors and staff who also contracted the virus and eventually perished. U.S. markets are still operational with no one physically in the NYSE but most companies have gone bankrupt. The WSB community thrived during this period as they continued to short every single company until one by one they went bankrupt. Most bulls  died from the virus along with all the boomers. A huge influx of babies were born in December 2020, coined the Corona generation. You can still trade options nowadays but are limited to the few remaining ETFs, SPY currently at $69 and VXX at $420 and companies like GILD at $1420, TSLA at $1880 and SPCE at $420. We are rebuilding and things will get better. Thanks to the Gilead\u2019s antiviral treatment and vaccine we will eventually eradicate the coronavirus. \n\nGodspeed WSB community! \n\n-A True Autist\n\nEDIT: On a serious note, stay safe out there WSB gang! Thanks for all the tendies you all have help me make, I\u2019m sure I speak for many fellow autists. Let\u2019s stay safe so we can continue making crazy money collectively! (And donating a % to charity). You autists are awesome! \ud83d\ude0e \n\n\ud83d\udd95\ud83c\udffc\ud83c\udf7a\ud83e\udda0", "created_utc": 1584650593.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flhf35/4202021_update_of_the_coronavirus/", "is_self": true}
