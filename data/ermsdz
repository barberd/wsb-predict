What they failed to prove is the central hypothesis *why* do Stonks go up?\n\n * *While phase 1 trials were ultimately unsuccessful (with the subjects enabling infinite margin ultimately holding researchers hostage), phase 2 of WSB has resulted in \u201can epic fucking bull run\u201d for all parties involved*. \n\nAs predicted in phase 1, when a subject sees another lucky retard turn $40k into 1/4 Mil, *they too* believe that this is possible to \u201cyeet a Jimmy Johns paycheck\u201d (sic) into buying a \u201ctricked out \u201804 Civic\u201d. The aforementioned phenomenon serves as the observational basis for the \u201cFinancial Gains Trend/Reverse-Trickle Reverse-Down\u201d theory of  economics, with money earned from the market returning as credit for goods and services from an individual (but then spent directly back into Robinhood). \n\nThe FGT/RTRD economic theory states that when one instance of FGT occurs in the market, a concurrent RTRD must arise to pick up the leftovers in order for the derivatives to have held any intrinsic value from the start. THEREFORE, Stonks CANNOT always go up, UNLESS there are sufficient RTRDs to purchase the dip. \n\nIn conclusion, my research proves without any semblance of doubt that Stonks do in fact ONLY go up, BECAUSE bears are retarded. \n\nWorks Cited:\n\n\u201cThe Bible\u201d \n&lt;www.thebible.com&gt;\n\n\u201cWikipedia\u201d\n&lt;en.wikipedia.org&gt;", "created_utc": 1579567643, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ermsdz/financial_gains_trendreversetrickle_reversedown/", "is_self": true}
