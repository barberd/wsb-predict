{"id": "fi83hq", "title": "Restrictions on the DoD side", "selftext": "Am at the bottom of the food chain in the armed forces, but I was in a briefing with the topic of what\u2019s going on with other bases CONUS or OCONUS (Stateside or overseas) and what might be our direction. (I\u2019m CONUS)\n\nSorry, no strikes nor dates will be in this post.\n\n\n\nCurrently, all travel including changes of stations and temporary duties are coming to a halt for the next 30-60 days. Doesn\u2019t matter if its state to state or CONUS to OCONUS. AT LEAST FOR THE AIR FORCE, we are stopping those forms of travel. Foreign travel though, i think its safe to say that it goes for all DoD personnel.\n\nMany day to day operations are coming to a halt. We deal with a lot of foreign guys. From Europe, Middle East, ect. The personnel who live in the US and are stationed here are allowed to fly back to their home base. Those from other countries must be quarantined and stay where they are effective immediately.\n\nBase child centers are coming to a close, how long and when depends on the location.\n\nTravel while on leave is not recommended, they have not told us a firm no we cant go anywhere in the states, even on leave. But it is discouraged (Military way of saying you\u2019re allowed to, but no)\n\nUSAFA sent all cadets home excluding the seniors (they have graduation in May) which is giving me the idea that restrictions and possible quarantines may come down even harder in the coming months. Not confirmed, i think we are just preparing.\n\nUSAF basic training graduates will not be allowed to have family over for graduation ceremonies until further notice.\n\nCertain civilian DoD companies/contractors are temporarily laying off people to save monies.\n\n*None of the information I typed down goes against OPSEC.\n\nThe higher ups and several flight commanders from my base are meeting up as im typing this. News will be relayed down the chain as they see fit. So if something big cracks down, I\u2019ll edit.\n\n\n\nTL;DR : DoD is slowing down operations within bases and between bases. Base closures and quarantine has a possibility to be in effect soon. (Not yet confirmed, direction can vary base to base)", "created_utc": 1584138356.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fi83hq/restrictions_on_the_dod_side/", "is_self": true}
