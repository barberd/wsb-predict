{"id": "gijort", "title": "PSA: Take your fucking gains", "selftext": "So I just learned a hard fucking lesson today. At market open I was up over $1000, and more than 2k for the week so far, and instead of selling my positions, many of which had more than doubled, tripled and even quadrupled in value, I decided to fucking wait, thinking \"stonks only go up\" like I was gonna take my 750->7k in 1 week account to 10k.\n\nI got fucking greedy and I closed at 6k. And I did sell some positions and buy some new ones, one of which is up 400% and I wouldve sold at close if not for the PDT bullshit, so from open to close I lost more than $2500 of pure gains because I got fucking greedy. $2500 is more than triple what I started this account with. I got fucking greedy.
