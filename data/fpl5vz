Also, don't forget the Donald's  deregulation.   Yeah it's dangerous and stupid for the planet, but \\*\\*\\*\\* me, it really lets the capitalism roar loudly.    Tragedy of the commons can take awhile to bite you in the ass, especially at a global scale.\n\nOk, so the virus comes along and says \"look, any business that relies on human contact is totally \\*\\*\\*\\*ed.\"   So bang, market comes crashing down, because there are a lot of tickers in the S&P that do rely on human contact.  You know, gaming / retail / restaurants -  MGM, WYNN, DRI, ULTA, HD, and yeah maybe even the health ones, but they have always been in a precarious spot - LNC, UHS, UNM.   DIS too got hit, but something tells me they will weather this.   They're more than just a bunch of resorts.\n\nBut those aside, really, if we assume the market was not really in a bubble before but merely a reflection of a society becoming wealthier due to tech and money was more free to do its thing.  Also, we see approval numbers come out that show Donald is actually pretty popular with his handling of the virus.\n\nWhy shouldn't the market take off like a rocket?  Yeah, those tickers above I think are still \\*\\*\\*\\*ed, but everything else should do OK.   Besides, they were stupid businesses anyway and did very little for over all social productivity.  They were just mostly expensive, time consuming entertainment and social waste- what does that really do anyways?\n\nWe may have to restructure our economy so that we're all more efficient in how we become entertained, but this actually may be a good thing, and reason to be optimistic about the future.\n\nI'm talking MSFT, AMZN, GOOG(L), AAPL, NFLX, INTC, T, VZ, NVDA, NFLX, ADBE,  etc.  XLK is a reasonable tracker here.\n\nI'm not saying buy calls, I'm just saying that the reports of death may have been exaggerated and Social distancing is not necessarily a bad thing.   Lots of very very productive people work and learn from home.\n\nAnd then, of course let's not forget - the money machines go BRRRR \\* 10\\^infinity.\n\nedit to add for the downvoters:  You're all thinking like a bunch of boomers.  How sad, expected more from WSB.   But it's OK, don't really want too many people reading this after all.
