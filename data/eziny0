Volume today was also 2m compared to a 650k average.\n\nWith peloton babes taking over the fitness market and nautilus still advertising to your sleeping grandpa that still pays for cable I\u2019m wondering how they could possibly have good earnings. When the hell is the last time you met someone who tells you to check out their new bowflex??\n\nEarnings are the 24th and options are pretty damn cheap so I was wondering if you guys think there is a play here.\n\nTLDR; Who the fuck owns a Bowflex?", "created_utc": 1580945142, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eziny0/nautilus_nls_earnings_224/", "is_self": true}
