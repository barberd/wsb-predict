How this all pertains to US markets, I\u2019m not quite sure... but if CNBC says that\u2019s why the markets ~~kinda sorta not really~~ sold off, it\u2019s gotta be true, right?\n\nAnyway, I work with several Chinese nationals, and they said that this virus is breaking out because of the Chinese New Year that is coming up, and everyone is traveling over there right now. \n\nSo to stamp out this type of outbreak, China takes your temperature at every train station and airport as well as any area where there is lots of foot traffic. If you\u2019re running a fever you are isolated somewhere nearby in a holding room for 7 days to make sure you don\u2019t infect people. If you fly into another region of China or return from another country you are sent home and your door is legit sealed off and you aren\u2019t allowed out for 7 days. They do not fuck around over there and as you can imagine, don\u2019t worry about invading people\u2019s \u201cprivacy\u201d when it comes to matters of health.\n\nCNBC, MarketWatch, etc. are all warning that this virus could really \u201cshock\u201d the markets. I personally only see this slightly holding back the benchmarks broadly until everyone else realizes this is overblown (based on the progression of the outbreak so far).\n\nIf this virus really was part of why we closed red today, I don\u2019t think we should worry about this long term.\n\ntl;dr buy calls, China will suffocate this virus", "created_utc": 1579642841, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/es1kly/mild_dd_on_the_coronavirus_outbreak_and/", "is_self": true}
