Buying all along the way because I believe in the product/brand and see a bright future on the horizon. it\u2019s been a rough last few weeks but I think the stock bottomed out last week and is on its way back up. Big jump today. I\u2019m expecting some good news very soon.\n\nI listened to the Q1 Conference Call last night and was so impressed I made sure to buy more this morning. Luckily snagged 300 shares at 16.89 this morning during the very brief dip that proceeded the big climb. I expect $20 in no time and a new high this year.\n\nThe stock may not be available on Robinhood but for all you autists with access to the TSX I reccomend getting some shares before this baby heads for the moon.\n\nUplist to NASDAQ or NYSE this year.\n\nNew accounts in the pipeline.\n\nNew CEO knows her shit.\n\nWatch out motherfuckers.\n\n$CWEB", "created_utc": 1560997624, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c2qa0v/anyone_following_cweb/", "is_self": true}
