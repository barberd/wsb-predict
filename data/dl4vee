Good info on option pricing.", "selftext": "BYND started at $113 today and dropped like an anvil to 106. Either it triggered some limit buys or it got some algos buying. Either way, it did Jesus rise from the dead type of resurrection back to currently $110. I noticed the option prices went all over the board today. Take for example,  the price range for the 110, 105, and 100 puts had a margin of change of 30-40% for the same underlying price at different times. People can't decide which way it's going and lost confidence in their put positions. The cost of puts are for sure at a low point right now considering lockup expiration and the volatility of this stock, tutes are probably not in favor of holding out. \n\nForget analyst target price slashes and news of increased competition, just look at their rolling out of their burgers at Dunkin'. That gave it a 3% pump pre-market and it lost grip of momentum in just 30 minutes. \n\nMy position currently: \n\n5 puts for 105 10/25 exp. Avg price - 2.29\n\n10 puts for 110 10/25 exp. Avg. price - 1.46.\n\n3 puts for 110 10/25 exp.
