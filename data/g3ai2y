That is under the assumption that equity is risky and threat of down years/months loom. However, what we just witnessed is that the federal reserve and government will not let any company companies go bankrupt at all. Therefore the risk of losing equity value is drastically decreased. Therefore I think equity risk premium needs to go way down. To perhaps 2% or even 1%. That should give the market a PE ratio of between 38 and 62. At this ratio range spy should be trading between 500 and 800. \nTldr SPY jan 2022 500$ calls.", "created_utc": 1587157523.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g3ai2y/case_of_why_spy_should_go_to_all_time_highs/", "is_self": true}
