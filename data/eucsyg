Here's why.\n\n1. \\[Weak - Med Evidence\\] China has a history of covering up bad numbers to try to fix problems and \"face\"\n2. \\[Very Strong Evidence\\] Look up \"Hospital\" in Wuhan. I came up with 18-19 hospitals on Google Maps in just the city center alone, and those are the only ones that are on the map. Looking a bit further, there are many more hospitals on the vicinity of the city center. There may be more. If we take the \"Total Infected\" in China which is reportedly around [1975](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/coronavirus-china-latest-updates/2020/01/26/4603266c-3fa8-11ea-afe2-090eb37b60b1_story.html), That means on average we're getting around 103 patients per hospital. You're joking right? Here's a [link](http://www.rmhospital.com/896/8963.aspx) to just ONE of the hospitals in Wuhan. For this one singular hospital, the google translate is telling me there are 1,200 beds available. BUT ALL THE HOSPITALS IN WUHAN ARE OVERCAPACITY? The doctors and nurses are all [freaking out](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/etpveg/chinese_doctor_in_the_city_of_wuhan_in_tears/) about how there's no room apparently. So you're telling me one hospital has a 1200 person capacity, its over filled, there are 17-18 more hospitals in the city center, and there are only 1975 people infected? Lol. \n3. \\[Further Strong Evidence\\] Apparently, we don't know if this is true or not, but a nurse/doctor in Wuhan just posted a video claiming 90,000 people are infected. She says there is about a 1:14 ratio where if one person is infected, 14 more will get infected on average. Here's the [video](https://twitter.com/terrence_str/status/1221100970521829377?s=21). 90,000 people would fit the number of hospitals in Wuhan much more. In fact too much. If we're assuming an average 750 bed capacity for all the hospitals in the city center, that would be about 14750 bed capacity for hospitals in the city center. There are other hospitals in the vicinity of the city as well so that would be maybe 3x more if we go on all sides. That's around 50000. She is claiming 90,000 (btw we don't know where she got that number from, but it makes more sense), which is much more than the government reported number, but it make a lot more sense than 1975. \n\nSo basically that's why I think this might be much worse than anticipated.
