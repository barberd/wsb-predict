Prior to this, Macau government tourism office reported a 75% decrease in mainland tourists for the first 4 days of the Lunar New Year compared to 2019. Mainland tourists made up 70% of visitors in 2019, and I\u2019d have to assume there\u2019s been massive drops in international tourists as well since many airlines have cancelled all flights or cut back on flights to China. \n\nTheir earnings are Thursday after hours. These events won\u2019t affect this quarter, but Will have a huge impact on outlook. Today the stock is up 4.5%.", "created_utc": 1580842223, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eyuv9h/wynn_dd/", "is_self": true}
