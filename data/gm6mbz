{"id": "gm6mbz", "title": "GSX Techedu - A Bearish Story for Bulls", "selftext": "[**GSX Techedu is a company you should\\* invest in**](https://imgur.com/a/gFOpenm)**.**\n\nThis post isn\u2019t really about macroeconomics or the general economy, it\u2019s about a specific company with interesting financials. In mid April, Citron Research and Grizzly Reports published critical reviews of [GSX Techedu](https://www.genshuixue.com/pcweb/#/aboutUs)\u2019s business. Maybe you\u2019ve already read their paper, a few other threads have mentioned the Citron posts but despite Citron claiming to have a \u2018smoking gun\u2019 in April, stock hasn\u2019t really been affected nor have I seen a good write up of the summary. So far, it\u2019s just people saying \u2018this in the next Luckin!\u2019 and then puts expiring worthless after a month of crabbing share price. Since their releases, Citron has had a couple updates to their evidence and more general news has come out about China\u2019s response to Covid that impacts online education companies. I believe the situation now is more favorable for speculation than it was in April, GSX has posted their quarterly results since then and China is exiting lockdown. First, let\u2019s look at the financials.\n\n*-* [*Quarterly Results*](http://gsx.investorroom.com/2020-05-06-GSX-Announces-Financial-Results-for-the-First-Quarter-of-2020-and-a-Share-Repurchase-Program)*:*\n\n*Net Revenues up by 382.0% Year-Over-Year*\n\n*Gross Billings up by 358.0% Year-Over-Year*\n\n*Net Income up by 336.6% Year-Over-Year*\n\n*Non-GAAP Net Income up by 405.8% Year-Over-Year*\n\n*GSX Techedu's PE Ratio for today is 258.43*\n\n*Current Market Cap: 8.34B*\n\n(GSX) raised $208 million in an IPO on Thursday, June 6th 2019. The company issued 19,800,000 shares at a price of $9.50-$11.50 per share. Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank Securities acted as the underwriters for the IPO and Barclays and CLSA were co-managers.\n\nThe online teaching industry has certainly been aided by the coronavirus, so if you believe the sole source of the bump is from movement into online classes, know that Beijing is reopening schools in June. Few parents prefer online education to in person classes, I\u2019ve seen both types of classes. If online was preferred, parents had the choice between online and in person before the virus. Nearly all chose in person lessons for their children. Online classes are a bubble, but that\u2019s an industry problem, not one specific to GSX, a tele-teaching service with an 8 billion market cap. Here are eight, kind of nine, points specific to GSX.\n\n**The grizzly/citron criticisms cover a few main points that I\u2019ll summarize, and you can read more about them in the links below.**\n\n**1a. Fake students - non-paying:** \u2018[Wuhan and the surrounding area make up almost 50% of the student composition in Q1 2020](https://imgur.com/a/jnHiqEV), which further supports our thesis that a large percentage of revenues are fudged given the large number of free classes offered to students of Wuhan during the Covid-19 crisis and, just as importantly, implies that GSX couldn't have a strong diversified student base to begin with, and that the previous sales revenues are largely exaggerated.\u2019 this is supported by Larry Xiangdong Chen, GSX's founder, Chairman and CEO\u2019s public statement that \"Since the outbreak of COVID-19, we have donated RMB20 million worth of regular winter semester courses to Wuhan residents, delivered free courses of all subjects and all grades to tens of millions of students nationwide, and through our Weishi platform, assisted over 134,000 educational institutions and professionals to transfer offline courses to online.\". There\u2019s a fair likelihood that students registered under the \u2018donation\u2019 are being cited as active customers.  *(for their student location data, note thar Wuhan is in Hubei, the location they\u2019re offering 20 million RMB in free classes).*\n\n**1b. Fake Students - double booking**: Students of the same unique ID are also being registered to classes of wildly different grade levels. In the links below, the methodologies of student inflation is shown, with many k-12 students registered in multiple different course levels. These are also in the area where millions of dollars in free classes were given out. The revenue is calculated by students in classes, but these are students in the area that are getting free classes and are multi-booked into different class levels. But what if it\u2019s just families using the same ID for all their kids? Remember which country had a single child law.\n\n**2. GSX has potentially fudged their numbers using duplicate classes**: \u2018We found out that 24 are free classes (hence excluded), 10 summer classes\\* (hence excluded), and 46 programs are duplicates. Effectively, there are only 20 paid programs out of the 100 programs that we\u2019ve initially recorded (100 total - 46 duplicates - 10 summer classes - 24 free classes = 20 paid classes).\u2019\n\n\\*Personally, I don\u2019t understand why the summer classes are excluded. Often summer classes in Chinese schools are longer than regular school year lessons and cost somewhat more than normal, so \\~30/100 are legit. This also matches up with the revenue claims in **6b**.\n\n**3**. **They\u2019re NOT propped up by the Chinese government**, in fact, they seem to not get along with local officials: \u2018Both JiaZhangCun and Parent YouYou are undisclosed related parties of GSX that were founded by members of the Xiong family, who have a well-documented history of defying the Chinese government (e.g., charged with fraud, failure to submit annual filings, cannot be contacted at registered address, altering documents without authorization, business license revoked, etc.)\u2019  There\u2019s also evidence that JiaZhangCun is not currently operational.\n\n**4**. **Numerous shell companies being used to move costs off GSX\u2019s books**: Efforts to trace subsidiaries and co-ownerships resulted in a list of shell companies, some serving as marketing agents for GSX. [I recommend you read more about this here.](https://citronresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Citron-presents-to-US-regulators-definitive-evidence-of-GSX-Techedu-update.pdf) I feel like this is one of the more interesting sections but in trying to summarize it I can\u2019t do the full story justice.\u25cfXiaoyi Jinxiu Curtain Mall: \u200bthe legal representative listed for Xiaoyi Jinxiu Curtain Mall was posting jobs for Gaotu (i.e., GSX), yet the Chinese government\u2019s business registry states that they are in the business of selling window curtains.\n\n\u25cfXiangyang Xiangzhou District Hongshunqi \u200bCar Mechanics. Their business descriptions on the Chinese government\u2019s business registry are quite peculiar for a company engaging in marketing on behalf of GSX.\n\n\u25cfBeijing Youlian\n\n\u25cfBeijing Huatongwanjia \u200bCommerce\n\n\u25cfBeijing Prosperity \u200bPrinting\n\n\u25cfZhuhai Jingpo \u200bClothing\n\n\u25cfXi'an Beilin District Zhongchangfei \u200bBaby Products\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to say how much of this is normal Chinese-business goofiness. From the Grizzly Research report: \u2018GSX also failed to address the main concern that these related parties exist to remove expenses off the company\u2019s books. Instead, they deliberately misconstrued the previous criticisms of Grizzly Research\u2019s and said that \u201cBeijing Youlian transferred its profit to GSX.\u201d Moreover, the company failed to address the job postings that Grizzly Research found which signals that related parties are likely alter egos for GSX, as we have seen in other fraudulent Chinese companies over the years.\u2019\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1768259/000119312519294656/d818535df1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1768259/000119312519294656/d818535df1.htm) vs [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1768259/000119312520097205/d865746d20f.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1768259/000119312520097205/d865746d20f.htm) showing an RMB 6 million decrease GSX\u2019s valuation allowance related to subsidiary disposals in 2017.\n\n**5.** [**Growth 10x as fast as similar companies**](https://imgur.com/a/GuGdpwh)**:**\n\n\u2018The chart (in the link above) showed the 2 years leading up to IPO, this is the completely obscene lie that GSX attempts to tell going forward. This revenue growth chart shows GSX expectations going forward vs. the actual results of EDU, TAL, and Koolearn coming off the same historical revenue base.\u2019 This is the best point in terms of making GSX in particular look fishy. Online education has a fairly low barrier to entry, you could find chinese students to teach english to right now. What makes GSX so much more profitable than its competitors in the field? This trend also began before the virus, so it\u2019s not just a flight to an online alternative.\n\n**6a.** [**GSX's Chinese Official Government Financials Differ from the Ones Filed with the SEC**](https://imgur.com/a/lveSoWq): GSX claims \u201cThe gap between the company's credit report and S-1 filing was actually GAAP difference between China and U.S. after the group's restructured to spin-off 2B business in 2017. The difference is totally reasonable and legitimate and has nothing to do with operational numbers.\u201dThe link in the 6a header summarizes the breakdown in 2017-2018 sum on credit reports vs what they filed with the SEC. [Further reading.](https://citronresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GSX-Techedu-The-Most-Blatant-Chinese-Stock-Fraud-Since-2011-ver2.pdf)\n\n**6b. Additional revenue discrepancies**: \u2018The total revenues from the 34,726 unique IDs sum up to around RMB 70.9 million. We then extrapolated the revenues from this sample onto the rest of the remaining untracked classes and have arrived at an estimate of K-12 Q1 2020 revenue of RMB 316 million, which amounts to a 60% discrepancy with reported K- 12 Q4 2019 revenue of RMB 773 million. K-12 revenues make up more than 80% of GSX total revenues.\u2019 Fairly clear cut, Citron\u2019s estimation methods are available more in depth through the 6a link.\n\n**7. Twitter**: CEO Larry made a [GSX twitter this month](https://twitter.com/GSXIR1) to say, \u201cSince the first day of our founding, we have regarded integrity as our core value. We are honest to not only our investors, but also our students and parents, and every employee of the company.\u201d Having experience with private chinese schools myself, this statement is unlikely to be true. You can also note point (**3**) as reason to doubt.\n\n**P/E:** compared to its industry competitors GSX\u2019s price:earnings ratio seems quite high, but actually this is outdated, the below graph has GSX at 186 but it\u2019s risen even higher to 258 as of 5/17/20: [https://imgur.com/a/mbBh1Ap](https://imgur.com/a/mbBh1Ap)\n\n**Summary**: (1) China is likely heading into a recession and has posted their first ever GDP contraction since record keeping began , (2) tele-education is a bubble in china, (3) this company is particularly shady and seems to be cooking the books, and most importantly (4) they\u2019re not too big or connected to fail.\n\n**Disclaimer**: This is just an accumulation of Citron Research, [Grizzly Reports](https://grizzlyreports.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Research-Report-GSX-Grizzly-Research-25-Feb-2020.pdf), and publicly available information of GSX\u2019s financials. If you think any of this information may impact the companies long term profitability, remember, stocks only go up. Also, Citron and Grizzly might be wrong, I might not know how to read financial statements, and GSX might be a totally honest company.\n\n**Positions**: 12/18 35p, got a buy order for 10/16 40p but we\u2019ll see how things go", "created_utc": 1589825019.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gm6mbz/gsx_techedu_a_bearish_story_for_bulls/", "is_self": true}
