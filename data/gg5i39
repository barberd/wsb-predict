Tried posting on r/options and got deleted", "selftext": "Whats the downside to using $100k as collateral and selling weekly Puts for NCLH or CCL that are a couple dollars OTM. Let's say I sell 100x 10p on Mon with an expiration on Fri, that way I don't get locked in long term incase of bankruptcy.  Keep doing that every week collecting the premium. If the stock does drop below the strike price and I have to buy 10,000 shares, then I can use the shares as collateral and sell 100x calls with a strike price a couple dollars above what I paid for the shares. I would collect the premium every week until it reaches that new strike price, when it does sell the 10,000 shares for a profit and turn around and start selling Put again. I understand if it drops below what I paid for the shares and it doesn't come back up I will be instantly down when exercised but I'm also ok with holding onto the shares long term. Whats the downside? I could pocket between $3k-$4k weekly, almost seems like I'm missing something.
