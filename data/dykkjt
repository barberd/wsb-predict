Well let me tell you about the European stocks like Germany (their market is called the DAX) and recently their Fed bank (the ECB) came out and said they might consider buying stonks.\n\nYes - you heard right, their equivalent of the Fed , pumping stocks!!\n\n\u201cThe answer came on Saturday courtesy of ECB policy maker Madis Muller, the governor of the Bank of Estonia, who essentially hinted that the ECB could very well buy stocks during the next recession\u201d.. like Swiss and Japan do openly. This was quoted in many newspapers.\n\nSo fellow autistas, thank me later and let\u2019s ride round downtown LA in your lambo thanks to buying DAX German stocks naked calls. Already up 1% today as the pros dive in.\n\nThe only question is , can we buy them on Robinhood? I have another naked call to jump on right now but when this thing moons - don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn ya!..", "created_utc": 1574170970, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dykkjt/time_to_diversify_sp_yolo_international_style/", "is_self": true}
