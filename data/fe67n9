{"id": "fe67n9", "title": "$UAL: +600%", "selftext": "Originally bought 32 contracts and sold 10 today for 600% profit. Even in that, I made TWO mistakes. The first was placing a market order for my contracts, allowing one for double the fucking price to get into my lot of 32. THIS IS WHY LIMIT PRICING IS SO IMPORTANT. Same day. Same transaction.\n\nThe second mistake was not realizing this until I sold the 10 contracts today, otherwise would have sold the 1 straggler for 300% and kept a bigger lotto.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m1tqm684lyk41.png?width=918&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3e7a66e49e02fee4a6586581809805d7c3d42b8", "created_utc": 1583459674.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fe67n9/ual_600/", "is_self": true}
