The 200 week moving average has been support for this entire bull market - 9 fucking years!!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qe68eao0jbr41.png?width=1044&format=png&auto=webp&s=2640b176655d0341604e956532613eed2af27490\n\nSecond, it's the .382 Fib of the entire price decline from the all time high. The two line up perfectly. When a structural support (resistance) and a major fib line up, it's like wearing two condoms during gay sex - little jimmy has to work way harder to impregnate your boyfriend's sister's husband.\n\n![img](7od46vbjibr41 \"Second, it's the .382 Fib of this entire decline.\n\")\n\nNow look at the price action:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6be97modjbr41.png?width=1346&format=png&auto=webp&s=51ddf004701b380f9f67e8ec6f3797dea975dd4a\n\nIn a bull market, this would be hella bullish price action - price banging on the door, eventually breaking it down. But we're not in a bull market are we? Hellllll no we're not.\n\nIn a bull market, an impulse gap like the one we had this morning above a previous short term trend of the previous move (see the red line drawn from the ATH) would be on high volume.\n\nCheck out this pitiful volume today:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bwkoouzxjbr41.png?width=1346&format=png&auto=webp&s=e55cad6e16a52e32f68c14a581211ce8222f05d0\n\nJust sad, sad volume for a gap impulse.\n\nFinally, factor in where we closed. RIGHT at the 200 weekly MA. Not above it. the final minute saw HUGE sell volumes into the close.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v71xmxsbkbr41.png?width=1346&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5a134ebbc82de1050f2cd145df0e8dacb25a577\n\nNow look, I'm not saying price can't continue up further. It absolutely could. There have been enormous short positioned established in the past two weeks which will put upward pressure on prices and could carry price to $270-280 if we break above $264 with high volume.\n\nBUT, if we fail here for the THIRD time. The selling is going to be absolutely vicious. 20 day realized volatility is 100. ONE FUCKING HUNDRED. UNFUCKING PRECEDENTED. The VIX is currently at 43 after a 7% SPY move. These are unfuckingprecedented times people.\n\nLike all TA gays, I'm here to tell you that price could go up, but there's an absolutely beautiful technical setup for a massive implosion.", "created_utc": 1586232407.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fwdq0j/put_holders_this_is_not_the_ta_you_deserve_but/", "is_self": true}
