Sure we were extremely oversold and the mantra of Wall Street is to buy the dip + massive short squeeze, but ultimately this rally will not last and will prob burn a lot of people including some of our own.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **Why the market is in for a rude awakening**: Let me explain why, in this scenario, the mantra is wrong and the leg down will be even more brutal than the first. There is little reason to believe that this crash is going to be similar to anything we have seen before, simply put, the US economy has never been shutdown like this before... like never. The fed is giving out loans and supplying the market with \"much needed liquidity\", sure, but the amount of time it has taken and not even a sliver of the money promised has reached small businesses. We are going to see massive unemployment the likes this country has never seen before, and before you say priced in or any truly autistic comment you can think of; this is not priced in. The market is simply short squeezing/fed induced buying to levels I'm sure not even the most bullish of our community could of seen. Once the repos stop, which they will, and the institutions find a nice hefty place to load up on shorts the market will drop like a fly.\n2. **Corporate earnings**: Earning season is just around the corner and I'm sure we all know what shit storm is about to be released: lower guidance, decreased dividends, and extremely low earnings for the next quarter. Not to mention, reports about consumer demand, more unemployment numbers, bankruptcies... you get the point. This is going to be a wake-up call for the market as we have only been trading off the virus these past few weeks. The market has been doing the following, *\"Oh we had a decrease of deaths from yesterday.. well fuck me silly, I think that deserves an increase of 7%.\"*, and you can see why this rally is not sustainable. The market cares more about the economy more than anything, and next week will be a true testament to how we truly are fucked. \n3. **GDP**: Finally, GDP is going to be an absolute shit show, I mean have we ever had a \\~(-30%) GDP in a quarter before(expected in Q2)... the market has never seen something like this and will result in peak fear, the likes we have never seen before in this market, and with that comes increased and even a new high for the VIX. \n\n**Side note to the infamous** **VIX**: This is a wish of mine but i think we see a triple top in vix, just some wishful thinking, but one for the virus scare, one for the preemptive economic scare, and finally one more when we finally realize how fucked we actually are.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Final thoughts**: The economy has never experienced something like this before, we are a consumer economy at heart. Main Street is shutdown and Wall Street will feel the wrath sooner rather than later.\n\n**TL:DR:** Market is going to hell and with that my **6/30 175 puts** will print.\n\n Thank you for listening, also shout out to my boy u/Variation-Separate for helping with the ride and check his posts out for some more insight.", "created_utc": 1586424023.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxpbd6/2020_bulls_bears_and_the_rug_pull_of_the_century/", "is_self": true}
