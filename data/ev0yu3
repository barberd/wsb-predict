{"id": "ev0yu3", "title": "Markets will begin to price in Impeachment", "selftext": "Up to this day, Impeachment has been designated as a nonstarter by the rest of the world. People chalk it up to unmitigated derangement but levers that control Washington are not what they seem on paper.\n\nI have worked with these people. Politicians do not act of their own accord. Some Congressmen or Senators have handlers (explore, Jeff Epstein). Some know where the line stands between disavow publicly and never returning to Washington again if you continue to press the wrong buttons. \n\nYesterday a bombshell that is largely being ignored, and I think a major reason why the market is down today, is The President\u2019s NSA. \n\nTime and time again on this forum I have indicated that upon impeachment arrival into the Senate, a bombshell will force the Senators R&amp;D to reconsider their stances pre-house vote. This time has come. \n\nA major Washington fixture and player has just, if the New York Times is accurate, called the President a liar. Straight up and down, this will be used to reconsider the votes of what was considered to be a fixed tally on impeachment. Key GOP Senators are now opening the possibility that John Bolton testify in the Senate. However credible he is, this will be used to justify a majority for removal. \n\nThis is NOT the court of law, and no matter how much they think it is, the main driver is sentiment and the disapproval among the American public. \n\nThe President\u2019s own NSA, not intermediaries or underlings, will call him a liar in the Senate and this will bring a whole new level to this case.\n\nThe markets will react accordingly. Keep your eyes peeled as this could unfold quickly with many moving parts.\n\n- GF", "created_utc": 1580188084, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ev0yu3/markets_will_begin_to_price_in_impeachment/", "is_self": true}
