You've been warned.\n\nI know retail is divisive right now but Nike is getting upgraded like crazy (https://www.barrons.com/articles/nike-stock-keeps-notching-higher-price-targets-as-street-sees-bright-future-51592927488). That's a 112, 122, 113, 117, and 130 target, all buys, all from this week.\n\n\nWe've seen some retailers flop but others who have shifted more towards online sales have generally done well. I personally believe seeing brands like Under Armor tank benefits a market share giant like Nike in the long haul. Earnings are Thurs after close so there's time to take profit as well. \n\nIV is low too...Time to inverse myself? 105 and 110C 7/17 looking juicy. 8/21 looks good too. Maybe I'm just getting FOMO from missing out on LULU. Thoughts?", "created_utc": 1592938447.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hekjo7/nike_earnings/", "is_self": true}
