{"id": "cbgeqe", "title": "My strategy", "selftext": "It took me 2.5 years to be profitable from stocks and took Ricky Gutierrez 5 years ( famous stock Youtuber ) the one thing I can say to y\u2019all newbies is to keep shit SIMPLE. Stop crowding your chart with indicators thinking you can understand it all then creating a strategy off of it. Keep it simple. I personally use the 20/50/200 EMA and VWAP when it comes to indicators on the chart. Off the chart I use RSI and MACD. Sometimes I won\u2019t even use all 3, if I don\u2019t feel like trading a lot that day, I will just use the 50/200 EMA, if the 50 is above the 200, and when the price breaks above the 50 EMA to the upside, buy. Keep an eye on it, it might bounce off the 50 a couple times, then when it does, immediately sell and take profits. If I want to make a lot of money, I use the 20/50 EMA and use the 20/50 EMA crossover strategy since they crossover multiple times throughout the day. But theirs many strategies you can do with these 3 EMAs. ANYWAYS, KEEP IT SIMPLE.", "created_utc": 1562763598, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cbgeqe/my_strategy/", "is_self": true}
