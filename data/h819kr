Sit down and let me spin you a yarn about how I came to the shining beacon of light Hertz.\n\nIt was 1985. Without any prospects of a love life, I signed up for a VHS mail-in dating service. That's when Ronda came in my life, we talked for hours. I didn't have much money though, so I used the pay phone down by the honky-tonk bar. Eventually our lustful ways couldn't be subdued and we agreed to meet.\n\nThe next day, I packed my things. Ninja stars, my eight-track player, a copy of Hustler, and my favorite pube comb \"Johnny Flame\".\n\nThe Hertz dealership was right next door to my hut in the retention ditch by the road. I'd fashioned it out of old cardboard boxes and chewing gum I'd taken out of dirty ash trays.\n\nAt first, I didn't think they rent to me. I'd been caught once siphoning gas out of the Ford Pintos and huffing it behind the employee break area. But it had been awhile and I need a sweet ride. So I walked in confidently. After all, I had stuffed my wranglers to the brim with old aluminum foil. No balls no brass tacks.\n\nIf it's not obvious, I meant business.\n\nThe young gun behind the counter stared at me, \"Sir I told you last time, you can't keep getting free coffee here. Please leave\"\n\n\"Not today slick. I need a hot ride.\" I snorted, flecks of coke-laded snot spraying the countertop.\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"Yea sonny. I've been playing the stratchers. Here look.\"\n\nI held up a bag of quarters I'd gotten from the parking meters. Not rocket science, just the mighty power of a methamphetamine induced strength. That of ten autists.\n\n\"Sir please, I can't take that. It won't even fit in the register\"\n\n\" This is America and I will not be denied my right to due process\"\n\n\"What..Plea...\"\n\n\"No listen here, I didn't go to fight and die for my country in Vietnam to hear you gum me about my finances. Now give me a damn car so I can see my hot girl Ronda.\"\n\n\"Who..\" He trailed off and gazed, choices needed to be made. As his eyes fell down to my rocking python bulge, he somehow mumbled, \"Okay okay, I'll rent you a car we only have the Ford Pinto outside. It's a bit beat up but it'll ride.\"\n\nThen I was off to see my sweet Rhonda. We agreed to meet at the Armadillo Bar in Tucson Arizona.\n\nMan what a smooth ride it was. This thing was a bitchin' sex machine. I pulled up to the parking lot and got out. Moments after I took a few steps, a weird haze filled my brain , like there were eyes burning through my finely comb mullet.\n\nNever have I felt so unnerved and I've done my far share of illegal donkey shows down in Tijuana.\n\nA voice called out, \" Sonny! Come here.\"\n\nI froze and turned, an old man hunched over a walker complete with Guy Fieri-esque flames down the side. Quite the nice touch. Long flowing hair jutted out from his head but no hair sat upon it.\n\n\"Listen old man, I'm trying to wet my whistle and eat some down south chowder on my lady friend.\" I was surprised at my courage, like some defense mechanism was triggered by the ghost of Christmas Douche visiting me.\n\n\"You still got Johnny Flame?\"\n\nHow could he know. He narrowed his eyes and waddled closer, \"Ahhh you haven't realized.\"\n\nI couldn't respond.\n\n\"Listen here and don't talk. I'm you from the future and I came back to tell you something.\"\n\nCould it be true? I looked him up and down. I blurted out, \"How? That's impossible. You must been Rhonda's friend joking with me. Now scooter on out of here.\"\n\n\"No I'm not and I'm gunna prove it . In 1977, you, or I guess we, snuck on down to the Miller's old house and started sniffing the neighbors panties we never got caught because we were just too slick.\"\n\n\"How could you know that? I never told anyone?\"\n\n\"Listen I don't have time here boy, you need to listen up. It was very dangerous to get here, I had to spike like five security guards and blow the CSO . I just need to tell you one thing.\"\n\n\"What.\"\n\n\"In the future you ain't got nothing. just like you do now down in them cardboard huts. Now in the future, it's bitching because they got that VR porn but you ain't got no money. We bet the house in 2020, those Stocktwits and big sacked Bulls kept telling us to buy Hertz. They said it don't matter if they ain't got no money or are tied up in them courts. It's a sure thing they said. Something about tendies.\"\n\nI interrupted, \"Look if you ain't full of shit, you know I'm really trying to see Rhonda so spit it out future me and say what you gotta say.\"\n\nHe turned grim, like I'd pissed on his boots.\n\n\"I'll give you one piece of advice.\"\n\n\"What\"\n\n\"Buy Hertz.\"\n\nEDIT: PROOF BELOW \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o7g0ljc1cm451.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf1e5573615d7d5b9340af3dd78db1c061e7b0f0", "created_utc": 1592025724.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h819kr/heres_why_i_bought_120_contracts_for_a_25c_0619/", "is_self": true}
