They tell themselves OF COURSE I AM FINE WITH OWNING AAL AT 5 per share and they repeat their mantra LOOK AT HOW MUCH PREMIUM I AM GETTING FOR THE PUT EXPIRING NEXT WEEK as they sell enough so all their buying power is in use.\n\nThen  the day comes where SPY falls to pieces after Mnuchin sneezed funny and AAL opens at 2.
