[Link](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/markets/when-hype-is-hope-coronavirus-vaccine-race-is-on/news-story/fe9a629615510a326ce6ab8dc55d4854)\n\n>One of the many things I have learned in 40 years of successful investing is that *hope* is never a good strategy. Yet it comes back again and again with every cycle. People *hope* their shares rise. They *hope*\u00a0shares don't crash. They *hope* that their government, central bank, super fund or adviser is there to save them from calamity. They (temporarily) learn the hard way that hope won't work. Then they rely on hope in the next cycle, having forgotten the past lesson.  \n  \n>  \n>The market crashes in March are another example of hope: too many people think that as the trigger was a pandemic, that's all that matters. So markets have been priced almost solely on the financial impact of shutdowns and recovery from shutdowns, They ignore the dangerously overvalued markets that existed before Covid-19 and that those markets are still massively priced for perfect outcomes. So when news comes out about any progress on vaccines, Mr Market pounces on this as a sure bet: jab a few billion people in the arm and we can all get back to the bull run.  \n  \n>  \n>Well, it doesn't happen that way, longer term. Several doctors have told me how dubious they are about a perfect cure. They never invented a vaccine for SARS-Covid-1 so why be so sure about one for this SARS-Covid-2? Flu shots keep having to chase new strains. And nobody ever found a vaccine for that pesky common cold virus. So by all means hope for an effective Covid-19 vaccine but it's better to plan around not discovering one.\u00a0  \n  \n>  \n>At some stage, reality will brutally intrude with some very nasty statistics that show up to 25% of the economy has been thrown into the dumpster. And what's left relies on debt and assorted financial steroids from central banks and governments. That's no basis for a healthy economy into the foreseeable future and definitely no reason to hype up shares as though nothing's wrong.\u00a0  \n  \n>  \n>Share markets revert to the mean. Always have and always will. I expect Wall Street to halve from today's values and the ASX to fall a third.   -- :T:\n\nTL;DR\n\nThe market is trading on hope. SPY is valued at the same level as it was last October; pre-pandemic, pre-mass unemployment, pre-suspension/big restriction on travel, pre-suspension of earnings guidance, pre-uncertainty of what the final outcome of all of this is. Retail investors are pinning their hopes on JPowell's printer being able to prevent a second dip/crater.\n\nPositions: 3rd/4th quarter puts (probably best on massively overvalued tech stocks), even 2021.", "created_utc": 1589925690.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gmybru/trading_on_hope/", "is_self": true}
