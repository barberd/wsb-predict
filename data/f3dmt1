{"id": "f3dmt1", "title": "Aggressive Option Flow (02-13-20)", "selftext": "Today  I included the aggressive orders that I see, many of them instead of just a few into one picture. Today I didn't color code the calls/puts  but did color code the companies.\n\nThese options orders are on or above the ask. Many have the same expiry and strike. Also lots of the orders were sweeps so these ppl were breaking down their order to get filled faster.\n\nAlso all these orders volume of the contracts exceeded the open interest in multiple trades so it's most likely not closing positions. Either buy to open orders or sell to open orders and based on the aggressiveness of the orders one can infer its buy to open. Some of these may be hedges and some most likely not.\n\nData is here - [https://ibb.co/Fmvp0kT](https://ibb.co/Fmvp0kT)\n\nIt's from 9:30-12:30pm or so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo me FEYE looks strong with that many for march, same expiry/strike and getting them aggressively, however they are already up like 40% from when these ppl started getting them.\n\nI will say this, don't just enter into positions based on this data alone in most cases. Use  technicals/fundamentals/options  data-flow/market sediment all combined  instead of just 1 of these. Use  protection like spreads if you worry  about losing what u put in and be  smart, understand the risks of putting  $ into weekly expiry's, consider a longer expiry.", "created_utc": 1581615812, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3dmt1/aggressive_option_flow_021320/", "is_self": true}
