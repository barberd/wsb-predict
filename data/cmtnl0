{"id": "cmtnl0", "title": "How to trade without getting fired", "selftext": "Noob here. Joined a BB recently and had to sign an agreement to close my non-approved brokerage account (Robinhood), pre-clear all future trades, and hold positions for min 30 days.\n\nI can accept pre-clearing all future trades at the risk of exposing my senseless YOLO plays, but a 30 day holding period on all trades??\n\nThese people are bona fide gains theives. Do they want me to become a vanilla long term investor who gets wet over 6% dividend yields and YoY growth? Because I refuse. I don't even know if I can continue religiously browsing WSB without partaking in the degeneracy.\n\nI've considered trading through a friend's RH account or creating an LLC but both are prohibited and can get me fired. No paycheck = no disposable income to invest, dreams of becoming a MD quickly die, disappointed dad, etc.\n\nWhat do you studs recommend? How does everyone here trade and use RH while working at Finra-compliant firms?", "created_utc": 1565112888, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cmtnl0/how_to_trade_without_getting_fired/", "is_self": true}
