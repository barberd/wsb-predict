When you sell such a low strike call, you are essentially selling the security at market price. Take this instance, You buy $F is trading at $9.07 then turn around and sell $1 call with Dec 6 expiration you would receive the $8.07 premium so at expiration the option seller would receive $9.08 which is approximately the market price that the call seller bought the security for. If you don't buy back the contract, then regardless of what $F trading at at expiration the option seller profit is capped at \"$9.07\".\n\nNow even with the incorporation of margins and \"infinite leverage\" the user would net $0 profit at expiration at expiration. \n\nYou can use an infinite series to model this at option expiration. So prior to expiration of the option your RH would look like Figure 1 where P=Initial Equity, 2 is RH max leverage ratio and n= number of times you the leverage trick. This is where you are seeing the crazy \"leveraging\", but at option expiration it follows models Figure 2 (condensed version is Figure 3) The sum of the series in figure 3 is 0, you net 0 profit at option expiration. You can leverage up and have your account LOOK as big as you want but at option expiration you would have netted nothing you are effectively back to where you began.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](ropoigb22m141 \"Figure 1\")\n\n![img](gl3sgtpv2m141 \"Figure 2\")\n\n![img](88ow7vjszl141)", "created_utc": 1575028027, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e3dr6s/why_infinite_leverage_is_for_all_intents_and/", "is_self": true}
