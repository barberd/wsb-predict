There have been plenty of online press releases detailing his investments and purchases of company shares -- and just recently purchasing nearly one million shares himself -- so buying his own stuff means things are going well and he's pretty confident about it, right? He also regularly hosts online video conference calls where he welcomes investors and speculators to come in and chat, watch the show and ask questions -- all done in live action! I feel like he's always been very transparent with his company practices and future plans -- which has lead me to be a firm believer of NEXCF.\n\nNot to mention, although NEXCF is labeled as having OTC shares, their reputation precedes themselves by openly reporting acquisitions, partnerships, revenues, profits, etc.\n\nAlso looks like volume and share price have been going up somewhat steadily in recent weeks.\n\nAny thoughts, opinions, or suggestions about NEXCF?", "created_utc": 1588894592.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gfhwd7/nexcf_future_potential_of_nextech_ar_solutions/", "is_self": true}
