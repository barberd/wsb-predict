I would be up 16k on a 3k investment if I had just held my Shopify July $170 calls. As a young trader, this is huge to me.  Anyway, I have been looking at a good point to buy a put and go against my long call that I was so sure would succeed.  I thought that point was yesterday.  I got burned yesterday and today.  Can someone please justify the 17% gain THIS WEEK. 52 week highs for 5 days straight??
