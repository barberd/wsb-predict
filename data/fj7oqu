{"id": "fj7oqu", "title": "What's next for oil?", "selftext": "**TL/DR: Puts on $OXY, $EOG, $PXD, $FANG and other shale oil players probably around May expiration**\n\nAlright hoes, a lot of my imaginary friends have been asking me whether or not they should get into energy stocks while they are laughably low. As a true WSB'er, I wanted to tell them to buy puts and fuck off but as a friend I felt an obligation to say google it and fuck off instead.\n\nThe future of oil is a politically critical matter for the global economy and the US specifically because of its dominant position in the shale oil industry. The Permian Basin and Bakken oilfield madness has been around for quite a bit now but as far as I know the **cost of production of shale oil varies anywhere between $40 and $90 per bbl** , with $40 being an extremely lucky scenario. Considering what happened to oil this week, most, if not all, shale oil producers are forced to tuck their cocks back in their undies and sit quietly. Just look at this:\n\n* Occidental Petroleum will cut and spending by 32 percent.\n* Murphy Oil will cut spending by 35 percent\n* PDC Energy will cut spending by 20-25 percent\n* Matador Resources will cut rigs in half\n* Chevron said it is considering cuts to spending\n* Marathon Oil will cut by more than 20 percent\n* Apache is eliminating all of its rigs in Permian\n\n**Any price below $40/bbl means brutal cost-cutting for those companies and definitely significant layoffs. As of right now, WTI is traded at $31.47 per bbl **.  According to Morgan Stanley, the industry needs $51 per barrel just to fund their capex budgets this year, let alone pay off debt or send money to shareholders.\n\nNow, what can we expect from oil prices in the nearby future? Well, here it really comes down to speculations but I just wanted to clarify a few moments.\n\n1. At this time, Russia is perfectly positioned to engage in an oil price war for several reasons:\n * They have been stashing significant amounts of money over the past 5 years to build up a solid financial cushion to sustain long-term budget cuts. They can sustain about 8-10 years of tight spending.\n * Putin just re-established himself as a czar of Russia and the coronavirus is a perfect excuse to ban any sort of protests as a measure of protection. This will, of course, be enforced militarily just like it has been for the past 10 years.\n * America is on a pace (in my opinion) to become one of the most infected places on this planet due to its extremely weak (or non-existent maybe?) actions in regards to testing and controlling of the virus. USA will be forced to throw pretty much all of its resources to fight COVID.\n* There might be no other such convenient opportunity for Putin to crush its American rivals. If the Russians are game, it's on.\n\n2. Saudi Arabia also has a significant financial cushion and knowing how strict their government is, we know it will have absolutely no problem cutting back on social programs to sustain a price war. If I'm correct, they average cost of production of oil at **10 fucking dollars**. They have no problem pitching their oil at $25/bbl and play the waiting game.\n\nIf that happens, we may start seeing another wave of super mergers like we did in the 90s. Put all of the above on top of COVID destroying demand for oil and where does it take us? \n\nRight to the cock-sucking motherfucking PUTS!!! \ud83c\udf08 \ud83c\udf08 \n\nAlso, don't forget that some major American banks are heavily invested in shale operators. Once those companies start drawing their lines of credit like Boeing did, some tits will go straight up.\n\nDisclaimer: I haven't gotten any puts just yet because I started looking into this this weekend. Will be getting some this week though", "created_utc": 1584303194.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fj7oqu/whats_next_for_oil/", "is_self": true}
