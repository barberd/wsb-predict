(For example, for AAPL, I searched for \"long AAPL\" and \"short AAPL\".)\n\nI plotted this data as a scatter graph, overlaid on the adjusted close price, and looked for patterns.\n\nMy conclusion: For the more highly upvoted posts, there is a trend of a post being written, followed by a jump in the stock price which takes place soon after. This is most noticeable in my graphs for AAPL and NVDA.", "created_utc": 1560706904, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c1clr4/an_analysis_of_rwallstreetbets_post_titles_and/", "is_self": true}
