{"id": "ghorhf", "title": "$BABA and the Chinese Recovery - What People Might be Missing", "selftext": "Alibaba ($BABA) is a Chinese e-commerce company and the largest commerce company in the world on gross merchandise value. \n\n\nAlong with their core offerings in Taobao (consumer-to-consumer retail) and Tmall.com (third-party retail platform), they also operate the leading cloud platform in China, AliCloud, and have several strategic investments, including Alipay (leading China payment platform).\n\n\nThe company saw a selloff from $230 per share beginning in January as the uncertainty around the impact of COVID-19 weighed negatively on results. Shares bottomed out 22% down at around $180 per share on 3/23. We know this was likely the bottom because this is the day when Softbank sold their stake and they are experts at selling low. \n\n\nI think it's generally well-understood that the recovery into March has been substantially better than expected - online sales of physical goods re-accelerated ~11% year over year in March, versus 3% y/y in January and February. This improvement was coming at a time when many consumer discretionary categories were 20-30% down on Taobao, driven by staples such as food, beverages and oil. Many of the sell-side research analysts believe that e-commerce trends will continue to improve into the back half of this year and thus believe share prices will improve past the $230 highs seen pre-COVID. $BABA will very likely beat on FYQ4 (CYQ1) earnings on 5/20. Sell-side expectations of about 20-25% growth into the June quarter may be more like 30% which would be favorable on share price.\n\n\nWhat I think is not as well covered / understood is that the near-term price dynamics will also be heavily influenced by the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC) meeting occurring on 5/20, 2 days after BABA earnings. The NPC is basically the equivalent of the US government deciding on the federal budget. Unlike in the US, where the government shuts down every single time because people can't agree on anything, generally the Chinese government has done whatever it needed to do in order to backstop growth, through a mix of credit expansion, fiscal deficits, infrastructure projects, direct government investments and potential direct stimulus / cash subsidies. \n\n\nWhile the 5/20 earnings will probably be optimistic, the 5/22 meeting will probably be enormously positive. I don't see a world in which the US pursues massive government capital injections and the Chinese government does not. This should both immediately and medium-term hugely benefit Alibaba, which has 60% e-commerce market share in China as the clear leader. \n\n\n$BABA $230 6/19, $BABA $310 12/18", "created_utc": 1589207966.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghorhf/baba_and_the_chinese_recovery_what_people_might/", "is_self": true}
