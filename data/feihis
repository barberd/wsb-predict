They just got their first two confirmed cases this week, have two more today, and for a country of more than 240 million who is one of China's largest trading partners, they have only tested 143 people; they won't even test the family members of those confirmed to have the virus.\n\n1. they have a theocratic government which hates evidence-based approaches to healthcare and it's kind of comical. Their \"health minister\" keeps downplaying the importance of hygiene and other precautions for the virus because he literally believed that \"prayer, not masks\" had kept Indonesia from detecting the virus prior to this week. Now, we know it's there, and people are returning from Indonesia with beer virus with no idea how they got it: the total is 7 people so far that have caught it after leaving Indonesia. Now, with the 4 confirmed cases, the tourist they say brought it to these two people was free in the country for long enough to spread it, and one of the women who initially caught it went 2 weeks symptomatic before finally going to the hospital. More cases will come out soon, it's just a matter of them not wanting to test because they're in religious denial. 2 days ago [their health minister reiterated that](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/indonesia-coronavirus-covid-19-patient-two-weeks-before-tested-12491484?cid=h3_referral_inarticlelinks_24082018_cna) \"The most important thing to do is to pray. If we are paranoid our immunity will go down\".\n\n2. They're pumping stimulus into their economy; another $700 million was announced Monday. Tourism is a major industry of theirs, though, and no amount of stimulus will make people fly into Indonesia to catch coronavirus. They can't put stimulus into that industry as cases go up because travel will have to shut down, meaning that industry will remain in freefall. [They've already stopped putting money into tourism. ](https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/03/03/government-delays-incentives-for-foreign-tourists-after-covid-19-hits-indonesia.html) 13% of all tourism in the country was by Chinese nationals, so that is also out the window.\n\n3. They have the fourth highest population of any country in the world and aren't equipped to handle the virus when they realize it's out of control; they only have one lab in the country equipped to handle samples and so far [they've only tested 143 samples.](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/how-come-indonesia-has-no-covid-19-cases-jakarta-post) For perspective on how little of a shit they give, their neighbor Malaysia has tested thousands of people already and only has an 8th of the population that Indonesia does.\n\n4. They're one of China's larger trading partners. [30% of all of their imports come from China, comprising over $44.5 billion dollars in 2019.](https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/02/04/jokowi-asks-aides-to-assess-coronavirus-impact-on-economy-indonesia-china-trade.html) This means they have high exposure as supply chain disruptions continue in China.\n\n5. They're desperate to avoid the economic consequences of coronavirus which gives them an incentive to push it under the rug - for years they have been viewed by international investors as a raw materials exporter only, and are trying to get into manufacturing, and so they're pushing back at all costs against low investor confidence. They even have banned shortselling in their own markets, allegedly because they fear the ethical consequences of \"profiting off of suffering\".\n\nEdit: ETF ticker for Indonesia is EIDO, strikes can be $19 on 3/20 or 4/20 \n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/544TXHx is what I have so far. I bought $24 strikes while the stock was at $25, now it's down to ~$21.50, I'm an fast food working econ student with 1k or I'd be more invested\n\nTL;DR indonesia is insistent they can pray coronavirus away", "created_utc": 1583522041.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/feihis/cake_day_tendies_party_indonesia_is_kill/", "is_self": true}
