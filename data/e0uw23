Earnings comes out, and TSLA, there was a slaughtering of Bears among the TSLA Bear Gang. Buy a truckload of puts, and then announce the CyberTruck. CyberTruck plummets TSLA stock, and Elon Musk rakes in the profit, but this is where it gets good. He begins to purchase shares as they fall, and they will stay low for a year. Because, next year, with his innovation portfolio, he is going to announce a new product that will spike TSLA. Will TSLA reach 420 from the spike, probably not.
