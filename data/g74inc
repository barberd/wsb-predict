Don\u2019t even get me started on CHK and WLL... \n\nIt seems like buying puts on crude indexes is basically over done and now a poor choice as they\u2019ve seen a slight spike and have an insane IV. With crude not getting much cheaper than dirt (USO puts are at a premium, SCO has run its course)\u2014that train left a few weeks ago. \n\nSo then... with a stock pile of crude waiting around how are gas giants fairing well since oil prices tanked? Why didn\u2019t they go down, too? Am I missing a fundamental part about the process of what oil is eventually used for? \n\nForget buying puts on CHK and WLL btw... IV is so insane you\u2019ll lose money after it moves down. It\u2019s like buying options the day of an earnings call. \n\nTLDR: oil is fucking dumb.", "created_utc": 1587715698.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g74inc/oil_is_big_gay/", "is_self": true}
