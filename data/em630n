{"id": "em630n", "title": "Looking for thoughts on Tenneco", "selftext": "I am researching companies that seem undervalued and Tenneco has really caught my eye. I'd be really interested if anyone has more information on what caused the steep drop back around March 2019 as well as an explanation of the current situation (down nearly 20% in a day) . I dont have as much time as I'd like for research these days so share what you know!\n\nMy understanding is that the current dip resulted from a resignation, threat of a proxy fight, and some kind of impending company split. So, some more general questions that I have are how each of those three things would affect the share price and why.\n\nI will be looking into this further over the next couple of days, if there is any interest in this I'll post what I find here.\n\nTL:DR BTFD 1/15/21 $15 calls. TEN looks to be recovering from a 52 week low, but there is still \"bad\" news.", "created_utc": 1578552960, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/em630n/looking_for_thoughts_on_tenneco/", "is_self": true}
