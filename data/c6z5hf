It is a hell of a ride...\n\nSome days I was dreaming of a yacht :D some days I thought: Just eating raming for a month cant be that unhealty!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo currently iam +/- 0 in my depot. Made about 25k, and Iam sitting on options atm which are worth now as good as 0 but cost me 25k....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Iam trying a new aproach: Dont go full retarded and try it another way.\n\nSince Iam not THAT experienced I want to hear your opinion on this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy not trade options like before, but everytime I make profit, I put aside half of that win to buy long term stocks like AAPL, ENB and so on to add to my portfolio. The other 50% and the \\*old\\* money are going in the next option.\n\nSo when Iam fucking up next time, I will have at least some more stocks!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBTW what do you guys think about ETNs like SDYL?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for your time", "created_utc": 1561816101, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c6z5hf/how_to_be_not_completly_retarded_or_is_it/", "is_self": true}
