I always give myself a little bit of room, and keep some cash to hedge.\n\nAs the market fell on Thursday I purchased more calls, attempting to average out. Bought around that 333 dip. \n\nNext day, market continued to decline, bought another position for 339 3/18.\n\nI've been looking into reasoning. CNBC has no idea, I watched them live at 11:30 on Thursday trying to figure it out. They eventually settled on \"investors are realizing the effects of corona viris.\" (Nonsense, and not supported by evidence in my opinion.)\n\nAnyway so looking into Monday, I've been asking around, no one has any idea what happened on Thursday / Friday aside from that Morgan Stanley Analyst saying SPCE is overvalued. \n\nAnyone else buy the dip?", "created_utc": 1582411973, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f80clb/bought_the_dip_anyone_else/", "is_self": true}
