I panic and find the first store. I pull over into a Target parking lot and run inside. I run into the bathroom and shit my brains out. \n\nAfter clearing my color for the 2nd time this morning I glanced over at the roll of TP it was untouched. I cleaned myself up and took a glance at the bathroom, spotless, even had my favorite scent of soap... in the middle of the afternoon. I walk out into the store and grab a few things and there is BECKYS FUCKING EVERYWHERE! Monday afternoon as the place looks like Black Friday at the dollar store.\n\nMy wife also got some bullshit boots on amazon so I had to do the deed and take the boots back so I can...you know get some mattress action. \n\nAs I\u2019m walking to the store, I get that Harry (Dumb &amp; Dumber) shit gurgling sound again, I speed walk into the store frantically trying to find there bathroom swinging my wife\u2019s boots around. I make it to the bathroom and this fucking place looks like a 3rd world country, 2 faucets just spraying water out for no reason, each fucking toilet has a LOG of shit in them from some disgruntled employee and the bathroom just looks, feels and more importantly smells like shit. I finish my business again (no I did not flush) I left my shit sparkles over that toilet.\n\nI left, returned my wife\u2019s boots and got some 50% off coupon because Kohl\u2019s is being amazons bitch...\n\nAnyways\n\nLong TGT\n\nTLDR: almost shit my pants twice, Targets was beautiful and full of people, Kohl\u2019s empty and 3rd world country bathroom.", "created_utc": 1578949355, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eoaadv/went_to_target_and_kohls_today/", "is_self": true}
