I\u2019m looking for something that will wipe out this 30k or print mad fucking tendies. \n\nAlso if the play you guys choose wins bigly, I\u2019ll eat **one Wendy\u2019s chicken tender** for every percentage gain and I\u2019ll post a video of it.", "created_utc": 1564007737, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/chf6a5/aftermath_of_10k_snap_yolo/", "is_self": true}
