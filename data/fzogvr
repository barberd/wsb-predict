Easter weekend prophecy fulfilled!", "selftext": "Ladies and gents, like Jesus himself, our lord and savior and failed gay mod Jarhack has arisen from the dead!  The son of /u/WSBGOD lives on as the holy ghost!\n\n**And on Easter weekend of all weekends!**\n\nBack with his newest alt, /u/hrbooms , he has removed the rock from his grave and has been resurrected to join us and resume profiteering from beyond the pale!\n\nObviously that whole TTG thing didn't work out in life, but that hasn't stopped him from weaponizing our autism for profits from the 4th dimension!\n\n**/u/WSBGOD has acted!  His son has arisen!  The prophecy has been fulfilled, as it was foretold in the WSB book!**\n\nCome one, come all!  Buy his WSB stickers before he is forced to move back to Mexico and sell his ghost ass and mouth for a handful of pesos and a chicken leg!\n\nI also hear they make great bookmarks for the WSB book sold on amazon, written by the late Gaymie Roganwhatever himself!  Highly rated user reviews also recommend them for ball and ass waxing!  \n\n**Are your nipples hard, or is it just me?**\n\nThese WSB stickers are a $.25 value, and at $1.25 they are a fucking STEAL!  Get yours before you *get yours*, you know what I mean?\n\nGet in on the ground floor, before these sacred relics are worth more than your puts!\n\nI mean....**DONATE TO THE CHURCH OF JARHACK CHRIST!  ONLY YOUR TITHES CAN SAVE US FROM THE BEER FLU!**\n\n\n\n*Disclaimer:  Sorry, WSB stickers are not a publically traded company and are unavailable on RH.  Check with your current brokerage for details*\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.redbubble.com/people/hrbooms/shop?asc=u\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/fzky5v/heard_of_wallstreetbets_these_are_pretty_neat/", "created_utc": 1586659080.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fzogvr/the_son_of_god_has_arisen_easter_weekend_prophecy/", "is_self": true}
