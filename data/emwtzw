Although im only down a dollar. Lol but still i have a point. Thankfully i didn't going long with just a single leg call or puts would have lost money\n\nHow can i stop robinhood from automatically closing long spread way before expiration/closing bell at random times, wtf do they even do that for why there no risk other that what i paid defeats the point of even trading as other single leg (long or short) strategies are too risky or plain dumb to play with any broker in my opinion.\nWhat I really don't get is why they choose to close out the long leg ( and at the bid price too \ud83e\udd26) first and wait 20 min to close the short if was like the were intentionally tryna put me into debt \ud83d\ude21.\nIf i can figure out a remedy to this stupid predicament ill make some serious bank, maybe puting more cash in my margin account and quit my stupid 100 dollar trading challenge would work. They probably view me has a less risky investor to have. I really don't know what to do here\nTldr: help me find a way to stop rh from closing safes cash backed debit spreads when there is virtually no risk of assignment.", "created_utc": 1578688836, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/emwtzw/damnit_robinhood_you_did_again_dumb_mfs/", "is_self": true}
