{"id": "g1cxat", "title": "April 14 Market Analysis - Canadian Names Edition", "selftext": "I write these up daily over on r/investing and someone mentioned people would appreciate here so enjoy.\n\nI have mentioned a couple rules over the past posts.  Last week I noted not to mess with the Feds who have a money printing machine to keep the stock market afloat.  In my [post yesterday](https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/g0qgbm/market_analysis_april_13_canadian_names_edition/) I talked about riding momentum.  Today\u2019s lesson which many of you probably know - **the market is irrational**.  SPY was up 3% today putting it at August 2019 levels, close to October 2019.  Think about that, with tens of millions unemployed in Canada and the US, many companies closed, the stock market has only gone back 6 months, which is still miles above where it was a year prior.  Personally I chalk this up to two things:  1. People don\u2019t see this as a true recession and believe businesses will just hit the ground running when this is over; and 2. Fed throwing money to solve problem short term.  Both could be true and theoretically we could just be propped up, even if we start seeing terrible financials over next 3-6 months.   Before my analysis for today, I realized I talked broad strokes without identifying all the companies I am watching.  So I will provide a list of companies I am watching and then my analysis on the day.  Note:  I watch SPY, Gold, GDX, and USOil to get an idea of general market movements. \n\n**Energy and Oil Companies** - MEG Energy Corp, Crescent Point Energy, Cenovus Energy, CDN Natural Resources, Suncor Energy, Enbridge, Teck Resources Limited, Husky Energy\n\nOil is going to test the low ($19.25), especially after a brutal -7.5% today.  From a technical standpoint \u2013 4 hour RSI close to oversold, $19.25 will be right at bottom of daily Bollinger Band.  If I knew nothing about the current environment, I would look at that chart and say $19.25 is a good bottom fishing play, meaning I would buy around $20 for the psychological hold, $19.50 and just below the break at $19 expect the bulls to show up and protect that support.  With both a supply and demand issue for oil, it\u2019s a risky play.  Despite that, most names were only down between 0.5% and 2% with only Husky being down 5%. \n\nPeople may be wondering why the oil names didn\u2019t fall much today besides a couple percent.  Others may wonder why I am playing oil in this environment?  Why am I currently holding over 20,000 shares of MEG?  Isn\u2019t that super dangerous and clearly not working right now?  Yes to all of that.  Personally I see two factors at play here.  One, what is priced in?  Here is what we know \u2013 short term both supply and demand are facing issues.  Storage tanks are filling up, supply has been cut but people say not enough to meet the reduced demand.  So the question is, what have people priced in?  If you look at the fall on some of these names I have mentioned, we fell between 70% and 80% since beginning of March.  I see this as peak fear and pricing in worst case scenario, so although we could see more short term downside, I think the worst is over and that leads me to #2 \u2013 government aid.  Today, during his daily briefing, Prime Minister Trudeau was asked multiple times about a bailout for oil.  He said he expects to announce relief this week for sectors greatly affected.  Numbers of $20B to $30B were mentioned.  It will be interesting to see what sort of relief is given, whether it is priced in, and the overall sentiment.  I have already flipped CPG from $0.92 to $1.41.  I will take some short term pain on MEG for a potential of a huge spike.  \n\n**Gold Miners** -  Kirkland Lake Gold, Kinross Gold, Barrick Gold, Eldorado Gold, IAMGOLD, B2Gold, Yamana Gold, OceanGold.\n\nAs mentioned, gold miners have been riding the bull break of gold to new daily highs or at least short term strength.  I said last week I did not expect this to happen because it has run so hard from the bottom without consolidation.  Look at this [weekly chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZKvsFFSi/)..  That 5 week bounce is over 90% from the bottom without consolidation.  Gold and gold miners were approaching a monthly resistance and it looked like people either sold or shorts got in to protect resistance.  Most of the names were up about 7% to 10% this morning but began pulling back, hard.  Names finished between up 3% to down 3%. I would expect a short term cool down before trying to break through resistance.\n\n**Marijuana Stocks** - I had only mentioned Canopy as that is the main one I trade because it is the sector leader and has enough liquidity for my trades but I also watch Aphria, Aurora, HEXO, Organigram. Cronos, and some US MSO\u2019s.  Organigram (OGI) had weak financials and was down 11.5% today.  Canopy don\u2019t give a shit.  It was up 6.5%.  It is now within striking distance of two daily resistances that have acted as the highs since the flush of March.  It definitely still has a bullish chart.  Doesn\u2019t matter though as I\u2019m still watching for short term bearish opportunity with long term calls.  \n\n**Banks** - RBC, Scotiabank, CIBC, Manulife, TD\n\nI have mutual funds/ETF\u2019s that are banks because I believe there is long term safety in these.  As a short term trader I don\u2019t care much for them because their increases and decreases are not as volatile for me.  Case in point today, up and down 1% across board and in a sideways tight equilibrium.  These are for investing, not trading.\n\n**One Off Companies** - Bombardier, Air Canada, Blackberry\n\n**Bombardier** - It\u2019s holding between $0.53 (high of the bounce) and $0.455 (low of last pullback).  I would say $0.45 is the true lower end for the psychological factor, I think more people will load up there to try and hold that.  If $0.45 breaks I think lower $0.4x is likely.  If it holds I can see it pushing $.50 again.  Finished up 2% today.\n\n**Air Canada** - should of sold my puts when they were up over 50% yesterday.  SPY continuing its ridiculous run makes global markets strong which makes Air Canada and other names stronger.  It was up 1% today.\n\n**Blackberry** - see above, up 3.3%.  Trying to confirm daily bull flag with break above $5.59 and then it\u2019s the double top of $6.09", "created_utc": 1586895099.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1cxat/april_14_market_analysis_canadian_names_edition/", "is_self": true}
