Yup, you guessed it, our pals over at illuminati incorporated are doing the same thing they pulled on us back in march with the 3:55 SPY gap ups.\n\nThese past few overnight sessions have been rebalancing of the illuminatis fund out of equities and into bonds. If you want to get in on this play, buy some calls on TLT in the evening.\n\nNormally, I would say, it works until it doesn't, but lets be honest, these cunts don't give a flying fuck if they know we know what they're doing. \n\nTL;DR: look at TLT, buy ATM calls at 3:55 for the next few days", "created_utc": 1593180378.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hg87lx/looks_like_the_illuminatis_are_repositioning_into/", "is_self": true}
