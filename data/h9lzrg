{"id": "h9lzrg", "title": "A primer on valuing publicly traded growth-stage companies.", "selftext": "Seeing a lot of misinformation around ZOOM technologies ($ZM). WSB consensus is that this is overvalued, a bubble based on astronomical P/E. Maybe it is, maybe it's not, but this look at P/E or P/S is very misguided and misses the relevant drivers of valuation entirely. In fact it's a criminally bad fundamentals analysis. The error comes in the form of investments being put in the 'wrong' place on the financial statements, on the income statement hurting earnings, when in your DCF they should really be capitalized on the cash flow statement. \n\nDefinition:\n\nGrowth-stage company: A company which is reinvesting all or a significant majority of its earnings in order to generate more growth through capital investments, R&D, or SG&A. Within growth stage, we have companies whose investment takes the form of infrastructure and capital investment (early Walmart), and companies whose reinvestment takes the form of hiring engineers, salespeople, and product managers (early Facebook).\n\nA mature company: A company which is partially or totally focused on increasing earnings, and achieves this through some smart reinvestment of earnings alongside significant cost-cutting measures. Examples include pretty much any CPG company.\n \nCompanies which are capital intensive are required to generate earnings on the income statement so that they have actual money to reinvest in land, buildings, and equipment. If early Walmart had not generated cash flow, they could not have built more stores and they could not have grown. A very high P/E ratio would have signaled that the earnings potential was incompatible with the expectations baked into the stock price.\n\nOn the other hand, if investment takes the form of personnel, there is no need to actually generate earnings on the income statement in order to grow. Just enough cash + earnings to buy minimal equipment (can be very close to zero in the age of AWS), and the rest is spent on income statement expenses, and there does not need to be anything left over. Add in stock-based comp and this earnings can go negative while the cash position remains healthy. So if you take a P/E on this kind of company you get a nonsensical result. If I were a CEO at this kind of company I would try to sandbag earnings as long as possible so my stock-based comp can over time expand significantly resulting for large rewards for myself and my employees while suckers missed out on the opportunity. (Bill Gates has actually admitted to doing this).\n\nLooking at Zoom specifically, best metric to use is a DCF on gross profit less steady-state operating costs. Looking at purely a gross profit multiple we have around 100x, which will fall to around 30x-40x in just 12 months based on a growth rate of 150% and then further. We can say right away it's not a grossly overvalued company. Looking at where it traded pre-covid, it's potentially overvalued by a factor of ~2, and it could in fact be undervalued.\n\nThe drivers of valuation here are solely around the competitive landscape (Microsoft Teams being the biggest, also Zoom's current advantages/disadvantages factor in here), and the long term TAM of video-conferencing, as well as the 'stickiness' of the product -- this last one is especially important. Essentially these factors and the interplay between them will tell you whether this stock is overvalued or not. Zoom's GM is very strong which indicates a very strong business, and can't go up significantly from here. But fundamentally it's a very profitable business assuming that the aforementioned factors above can remain in its favor. \n\nI wouldn't be a buyer here given that the FAANG companies are gunning for it and I expect them to succeed eventually(stickiness determines tail value in the DCF/acquisition value and my belief is that it won't be great, but this is a model sensitivity), my advice is that it's not a short based on either fundamentals or momentum. There is no catalyst and there is no solid short thesis.", "created_utc": 1592246066.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h9lzrg/a_primer_on_valuing_publicly_traded_growthstage/", "is_self": true}
