Instead, here's the formula..follow this and you may one day crawl your way back from -99% ROI like me. \n\nSo basically I call it a 50-50-50 approach. \n\nLet's say you have a bullish sentiment for TIM APPLE. With the 50-50-50 approach you invest only 50% of your account at a time. The other 50% is always hold as cash.\n\nThen within the 50% total trading amount you buy 80% calls and 20% puts..why puts you ask..cuz learn to fukin hedge your trades that's why..you never know shit could hit the fan like that iran strike. \n\nThen you put a stop limit order 50% below on both calls and puts. Lastly, your aim is to sell your positions hopefully the calls in this example at a 50% profit. \n\nRinse and repeat and you're all fukin welcome!", "created_utc": 1578370366, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/el638k/ok_listen_up_im_giving_up_my_formula_of_making/", "is_self": true}
