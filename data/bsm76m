{"id": "bsm76m", "title": "Capitalism", "selftext": "If you give 1,000 dollars to a company and they can use that money to make 1,200 dollars you should get some of that profit. If you give 100 million to a company and they use that money to make 120 million you should get some of that, too.\n\nWhen you purchase shares of a company, the initial sale atleast...you are basically loaning them money with the understanding that over time you will get more back than you put in. This is called capitalism.\n\nSpending money to make money, using capital to make money. I doubt this is going away any time soon. Its a good deal for both sides. Without that initial sale to get a huge bump in cash to rapidly expand, the company wouldn't be getting off the ground and establishing itself in the way so many have. Without the eventual profits from purchasing those shares in the company's future earnings, that company wouldn't be getting that loan.\n\nIts a win/win and its called capitalism. If you wanna talk about the fact average CEO income in the fortune 500 companies is 12 million dollars whereas their workers are making under 15 bucks an hour? yeah. Thats a problem and the shareholders should be putting their foot down. But if a CEO makes your company 100m more dollars than their second choice would have made? Then it was worth it to pay him 12 million a year. Because by hiring him you made a 88 million dollar profit.\n\nIf any random shithead can do the exact same job you're paying someone 20 bucks to do, then there is no incentive to increase their wage because they aren't increasing company profit.\n\nTBH capitalism has a lot of problems, but its mildly better than the rest of shit. Overall. Its kinda becoming an insular genetic/lineage club though, to be fair. I'm 3rd generation of a family business and I dont have to work, i own a home, and get 6 figures a year just for being alive because of stock in the family business. I get why that bothers people. I really do. But socialism isn't the answer and we wont see a decline in capitalism because both sides benefit.\n\nUnless big daddy gov decides to fuck us all in the butt. Then a lot of us lose and the sub 100iq crowd gets to have their degenerate and retarded decisions/reproductive decisions subsidized instead of just sterilizing those dirty leeches.", "created_utc": 1558731566, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bsm76m/capitalism/", "is_self": true}
