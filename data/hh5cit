Seems more and more bears are getting recruited every day not only in the mainstream media, but even in this mentally-degenerative subreddit.\n\nI'm firing all next week in just as the second wave is peaking. I believe that 401k re-balancing came to meet the second wave of rona this week and spooked the market. We've already had a reasonable correction, and states have made adjustments. 2nd wave is baked in. We've got trillions in the economy ready to fire and bonds and CDs won't even beat inflation, the market is the only place to be for natty gains.\n\nWe could get stim pack 2.0, vaccine news, police reform, infrastructure deal, and better reopening numbers from states that did it right, all within the next 2 weeks. Market is dying for good news. Bulls don't flake on me now, if you bought the panic dip in March you caked it. There's a whole lotta fish out there who are awfully scared to have exposure, and they're gonna miss out. Needless to say fading whatever moves the public makes is usually a good call, and there's no reason that should change now.\n\n$VFC hammer buy - great value and only premo brands\n\n$VZ hammer buy and paid to wait - 5G future\n\n$PLNHF play weed de-listing & reopening - holding to $100\n\n$CAKE hammer buy - flip to $40 and sell\n\nLet's run it back on wallstreet. You don't bet against the USA!
