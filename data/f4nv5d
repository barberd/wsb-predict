{"id": "f4nv5d", "title": "SPCE, The Final Frontier", "selftext": "Hello everyone. Yea bitch, another SPCE thread, I know. A lot of people are going back and forth between \"SPCE is gonna tank Tuesday pussies, Bulls assume the position for a bear ass rape.\" And \"SPCE is just getting started, Sir Richard Manson is going to take his followers to the new world.\" \n\nNow, in the event of a black swan circumstance, I do believe that SPCE could and would fall if let's say the coronavirus starts taking no prisoners and kills a phat chunk of gyna. Definitely possible. But, did no one pay attention to the close on Friday?\n\nFriday is the day of the \ud83d\udc3b. Typically we would see a sell of EOD. But what did we see instead in the case of SPCE? We saw a fat FOMO. Now, if people decided to buy into SPCE EOD on a Friday before a 3 day weekend, why would anyone be expecting a sell off Tuesday? The people who bought before the close I would assume are planning to hold their shares next week. \n\nWe don't have to worry about red Monday, and we'll be coming off Presidents day so we know Trump is gonna pump the shit out of the market. I doubt we'll see a SPCE sell off Tuesday considering Fridays close. And Wednesday is the big SPCE conference, followed by ER on Thursday. This thing will be pumping all fuckin week. So let's pray for no more news on Corona, and count our tendies next week boys. Godspeed to all, and fuck you \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b\ud83d\udc3b", "created_utc": 1581841369, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f4nv5d/spce_the_final_frontier/", "is_self": true}
