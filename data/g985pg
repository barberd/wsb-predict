They IPO\u2019d for $19 a share 4 years ago and have nearly doubled their revenue but stock price is up 6x since then????\u201d  How the H has the market had it so wrong all this time? Will it just go up 3-5% a day forever? \n\n\nI have asked myself the same question over the pst 5 years. \n\n\nMSFT IPOd 34 years ago. Took 33 years to hit $700B valuation. Then another 12 months to add another $700B to its valuation. Makes sense amiright? \n\nThe market sets the number, and we retrospectively try to justify it.
