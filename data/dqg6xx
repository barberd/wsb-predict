{"id": "dqg6xx", "title": "Infinite leverage explained", "selftext": "I saw a lot of comments on other posts clearly confused about what u/ControlTheNarrative (hereafter CTN) did to bilk RH out of $50k, so I thought I\u2019d write up a little non-stock/options explanation. This is how he could have done it brick-and-mortar style.\n\nCTN goes into his bank and asks for a personal loan. He only has $2k in cash to show he\u2019s good for it but when the banker sees he\u2019s wearing a helmet he assumes that he is safety conscious and writes him a $2k loan, i.e. 2:1 leverage.\n\nCTN now has $4k in cash.\n\nBeing a savvy investor, CTN uses the $4k to buy a purebred kitten from a local breeder. On Craigslist he finds a cat lady willing to pay him $3k today in exchange for getting the kitten next year.\n\nCTN goes back into the bank and asks for another loan. \u201cWeren\u2019t you just here getting a $2k loan?\u201d the banker asks. CTN self-soothes by rocking in his chair and mumbles \u201cNow I have $3k in cash and a $4k cat, so after considering my $2k debt I have $5k of assets. Can I get a loan for $5k?\u201d The banker shrugs, ignores an incoming call from the SEC, and writes the loan. \u201cA $5k loan for $5k in assets is 2:1 leverage\u201d, he thinks, \u201cthis seems fine.\u201d\n\nCTN now has $8k in cash and a $4k cat (promised to the cat lady).\n\nCTN heads to a puppy mill and picks out a purebred pit bull for $8k. On the dark web he finds a guy willing to pay $7.5k today in exchange for the dog when it\u2019s full grown.\n\nCTN goes back to the bank again. The banker barely looks up from a thick line of white lightning and asks \u201cAnother loan? You owe $7k now you know.\u201d CTN says \u201cWell I have $7.5k in cash plus this $4k cat and this $8k dog, so after considering my $7k debt I have $12.5k of assets. Can I get a loan for $12.5k? It\u2019s only 2:1 leverage.\u201d The banker is too blitzed to do math so he rips off a check. \n\nCTN now has $20k in cash, a $4k cat (promised to the cat lady), and an $8k dog (promised to Michael Vick).\n\nNext he goes to the local stables. After watching horses mount each other for a while, he buys a thoroughbred foal for $20k. At Bible study that night he meets someone willing to pay him $19k for breeding rights to the horse as an adult.\n\nBack to the bank goes our hero. The banker is getting a little worried now and tells CTN that he owes $19.5k. Let\u2019s say there\u2019s also $500 in interest to make it an even $20k owed.\n\nCTN reassures him he knows what he\u2019s doing by showing his WSB post history. \u201cI have $19k in cash, a $4k cat, an $8k dog, and a $20k horse. After considering my $20k debt I have $31k of assets. How about a loan for $31k?\u201d The banker shrugs - it\u2019s just 2:1 leverage - and writes the loan.\n\nCTN now has $50k in cash, a $4k cat (promised to the cat lady), an $8k dog (promised to Michael Vick), and a $20k horse (promised to Mr. Hands).\n\nThat night the banker reflects on the enigma that is CTN. It suddenly hits him that the cat, the dog, and the horse are not collateral that the bank can repossess to offset any losses CTN might incur, because they are contractually guaranteed to other people. The bank has given CTN a $50k margin account for only $2k in collateral, or 25:1 leverage! Whoops!\n\n\u201cFuck it\u201d he thinks. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll just put the cash in a safe investment that we can sell to close everything out. I\u2019ll call him tomorrow.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile CTN takes his $50k cash to the casino, shrieks \u201cYOLO!\u201d and throws it all on black.\n\n**\u201dGUH\u201d**", "created_utc": 1572673287, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dqg6xx/infinite_leverage_explained/", "is_self": true}
