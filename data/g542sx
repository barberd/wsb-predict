{"id": "g542sx", "title": "Activision is going to smash $83 and hit new ATH in three weeks", "selftext": "I am going to share with you why ATVI is going to absolutely smash their ATH back in Q4 2018 of $83, in which the stock price lost almost half it's value by end of Q1 2019. The stock closed at $66 today, and Activision reports earnings 5/5.\n\nActivision is in a much better position now than they were in Q4 2018 due to their ability to switch entirely to a high-margin, software driven sales model, reduce capital expenditure while increasing top line revenue, and significantly increase ARPU through seasonal DLC such as battle pass and cosmetic items. Activision was able to capitalize on this successfully as these did not provide a competitive advantage in COD multiplayer/Warzone and had high production value (weapon skins, character skins, calling cards, emblems, etc.)\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n**Record Levels of Player Engagement due to federal stay-at-home orders.** \n\nCOD player count nearly doubled in just one month (mid March to April). This type of growth is unprecedented and now in April, the player base has grown at faster rate since launch in October 2019. Activision may likely see microtransaction revenue double assuming a doubling in the player base.\n\n**Strong Cash Position and Continued Growth in Gaming**\n\nActivision is well positioned to take on this crises due to their strong cash position, which was $5.8B at the end of 2019. In fact, they will only benefit from this more as people continue to stay at home and continue gaming. Stocks like Netflix and Roku have seen major hype this past month, however the market seems to have forgotten about the gaming market, which I will dive into next.\n\n**Crossplay capability greatly enhances player enjoyment due to increased social factor**\n\nThe console and PC gaming markets are two completely different consumer segments, resulting in friends being distanced from gaming due to two competing gaming platforms. By allowing console and PC players to play together, this would likely result in increased growth in sales due to players now being able to play with friends they may have not been able to play with before. This would then result in an increase in play time (extended college spring break, furloughs, lay offs, late night binges, etc). All of this factors in to Activision's \"extrinisic value\" or customer loyalty and stickiness. Games are able to efficiently capture and capitalize on customer's \"emotions\", and Activision's marketing team is top notch in capturing the market's attention and keeping it for the long term.\n\n**Strong Product Line-up**\n\nI won't spend too much time on this one. World of Warcraft, Overwatch, Diablo, Hearthstone, Call of Duty, etc. These are some of the biggest names in PC gaming in which Activision will retain their loyal customer base resulting in steady and consistent revenue in years to come.\n\nUltimately, the market has not caught on to this yet. Media has only been referring to big name stocks like Netflix, Roku, Grubhub, Wayfair, etc. in stay at home stocks but they are completely forgetting about the gaming world. ATVI, EA, and TTWO are well positioned to benefit from the worldwide crisis. \n\nATVI call with any of the following strikes depending on your risk/reward ratio. These are on sale right now: $70, $75, $80 5/15", "created_utc": 1587425971.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g542sx/activision_is_going_to_smash_83_and_hit_new_ath/", "is_self": true}
