This is going to be the first manned launch in 10 years since space shuttles retirement.\n\n[https://www.businessinsider.com/spacex-rocket-launch-nasa-astronauts-demo2-commercial-crew-mission-history-2020-5?r=US&IR=T](https://www.businessinsider.com/spacex-rocket-launch-nasa-astronauts-demo2-commercial-crew-mission-history-2020-5?r=US&IR=T)\n\nNow Space X is not tradable and the only play here is good ol meme stonk SPCE and its quaranteed to go above current level.\n\nWhy?\n\nSpace X first test flight of falcon heavy was huge event in 2018 with over 100k spectators on site and 2.5m people watching live online. This is just a mere test of a huge rocket. Yeah looks cool but I mean what are the stakes really?\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon\\_Heavy\\_test\\_flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_Heavy_test_flight)\n\nThis time there are real people - muricans - going up into space after a looong time. US will show them Chyna and Ruskies who got the biggest peepee now. This event will be broadcast at 4pm live at a time when noone really has a fuckall to do because they\\`re stuck home/wfh. It will reach people in EU as well because falcon heavy flight was in an evening. The potential audience is enourmous, and tears of joy and pride will be shed for fucking sure.\n\nRest be assured Donald Pumpino will mention it on twitter 5x and during evening corona conference at least 2x giving it another pump.\n\n[https://www.space.com/trump-may-watch-spacex-crew-dragon-astronaut-launch.html](https://www.space.com/trump-may-watch-spacex-crew-dragon-astronaut-launch.html)\n\nSo all in all the audience here is in millions : 2-10m. Your boy Cramer has 100k.\n\nAnd people will be asking: how the fuck do i get on the ride? there are no pure play companies involved in space travel/rockets - but hold on - there is one company - SPCE!\n\nSPCE was dropping past 1.5 weeks because Branson is on a slippery slope and had to sell significant stake in the company in order to raise capital for his airline companies. SPCE is literally at the bottom and this event is taking place in 3 market days. There is very assymetric risk right now with such an event - after 4 days SPCE is pretty much guaranteed to be trading above current price.\n\nTLDR: buy SPCE before astronaut launch on 27 May. Buy stocks, options 29 May / 5 or 19 June.\n\nEDIT: added some articles etc", "created_utc": 1590103399.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/go7s1q/spce_will_take_off_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
