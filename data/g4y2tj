AMZN has also been making all time highs.\n\nWhat other stocks could be lifted by the corona e-commerce play? Fiverr (NYSE:FVRR). Fiverr provides a marketplace for digital services to be transacted online.\n\nBelow I have plotted FVRR's price trend next to SHOP's price trend, as well as their correlation coefficient.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[FVRR vs SHOP](https://preview.redd.it/0rbb4mccj0u41.png?width=1808&format=png&auto=webp&s=bdf51b02125f7972d0bea55f935857dd798f042b)\n\nThe stock has been rising rather unnoticed, in comparison to SHOP. Options market is fairly illiquid, however. The market cap of FVRR is about 1 billion. Could present an opportunity for smaller players (as opposed to large firms / hedge funds).\n\n**I'm in FVRR 5/15 $45 calls and $40 calls.** Earnings are also 5/7. The stock is up 14% today but IV is only around \\~95%, implying a standard deviation of only around 6%. As far as lotto tickets go, I think this is one of the better ones.", "created_utc": 1587406508.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g4y2tj/fvrr_yet_to_fully_pop_on_ecommerce_bull_wave/", "is_self": true}
