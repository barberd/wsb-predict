{"id": "fplquv", "title": "Something Fishy: Fuzzy's $SEAS Covenant Breakdown", "selftext": "Ahoy there, fellow Free Willy enthusiasts\n\nIt's your old pal Fuzzy.\n\nI'm pleased so many of you were able to pull yourselves away from ... well, pulling away at yourselves - to take the time to read and enjoy my previous post ([here, if you haven't had a chance to read it yet](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fopuyx/daddy_where_does_money_come_from_birds_bees_long/)). I don't like setting homework but unfortunately that's going to be required reading for today's exercise. I promised I'd come back to show you how to do this for yourselves using the most upvoted ticker. The most upvoted suggestion was $CCL, but they're jacked to the tits with Euro debt. I'm a red blooded patriot, and I don't want some bowtied Oxbridge douchebag coming at me about misreading tweedy fucking English law documents. I'm sorry you didn't get into Harvard, Jeeves, but don't take that shit out on me. Blame your parents for giving birth to you on a wet green rock in the North Sea instead of in the land of milk and honey. Anyway, that's the reason I don't fuck with that LMA noise. So we're doing the second most upvoted suggestion instead - $SEAS. Anyone bitching about Blackfish will get roasted (do I sound fucking empathetic to you? I ate whale on a business trip in Japan and it was delicious).\n\nI'm going to use headings so you can skip the shit you don't care about if you want to get right to the good stuff. Don't worry baby - I'll explain all the long words. Pull up a chair, pour yourself a drink, and try to concentrate for more than 5 minutes at a time without needing to take a body pillow break. If the idiots I supervise can do this, you can too.\n\nFYI -  I'm doing an AMA about this post and yesterday's in the comments at 3pm ET tomorrow because I have a gap in my schedule and I told my secretary to leave it open for you retards. There isn't a TL;DR because this is a teaching exercise. You're welcome. Strap in.\n\n**Brief background about me and comments on my previous post (skip if you want**)\n\nThe TL;DR about me - I find loopholes in corporate debt documents for money. Sometimes for goodies, sometimes for baddies, always for cash up front plus expenses and a retainer. The TL;DR for why you should give a shit - these can help you get an edge on projecting company performance when you balance them against cashflow and upcoming obligations. Today I'm going to teach you how to do this with full detail included.\n\nYesterday we worked through a short, practical example together - $SIX. I don't have a view about that  ticker one way or another and only intended to try and educate you idiots by using it as a teaching exercise. Of course, some of you went out and bought extremely OTM puts ($2 May death puts were up 4,200% this morning) notwithstanding that I specifically said I didn't have an opinion about their equity price about 50 or 60 times in the comments, and that even if I DID, liquidity crunch ain't happening for minimum 18 months. I tip my cap to you retards for taking completely the wrong message out of my post and applaud your enthusiasm for losing your own money. The spirit of this sub lives on despite the r/all invasion. Shoutout to u/pokimane for being the top. Girl, if you want a private session, my DMs are open. I'll tell you which stonks to buy.\n\nAnyway. Enough bullshit.\n\n**Shit you'll need to play along at home (don't skip this)**\n\n[$SEAS 2020 10-K](https://sec.report/Document/0001564590-20-007020/)\n\n[Amendment No. 9 to $SEAS Credit Agreement](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1564902/000156459018026263/seas-ex101_7.htm) (don't try and be smart and tell me they amended again in February. I know they did - but that amendment is pretty much just a commitment upsize and I'll be calling out the differences as we go along. Just take my word for it. We're using No. 9 because it attaches the complete document and No. 10 doesn't. [Here is No. 10 if you want to be so fucking fussy about it](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1564902/000156459020009872/seas-ex101_6.htm)).\n\nNOTE: Some of you seemed to struggle to find the debt docs yesterday. They're not in the 10-K. They go in 8-Ks that get filed immediately following the date of the Credit Agreement. Cross-ref the dates and you're off to the races. If any of you ask me where to find a 10-K or an 8-K I will not respond and I'd politely ask the mods to ban you the fuck back to where you came from.\n\n[Some music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3m3qOD-hhrQ)\n\nA drink\n\n**$SEAS Target Review (learning about our subject)**\n\nRight. So. Let's start with the 10-K to learn about our subject. Or you could just watching fucking Free Willy. This place markets killer whales as an entertainment experience. It's not an overly sophisticated beastie. Here are some core highlights from their 2019 fiscal year that we should consider. My comments are in capitals.\n\n* Attendance increased 0.2%, to 22.6 million guests from fiscal 2018. THIS OBVIOUSLY IS SHIT. ALTHOUGH I GUESS ONCE YOU'VE SEEN WILLY ONCE, A REPEAT TRIP ISN'T REALLY NECESSARY SO EXPECTING THIS TO GROW DRAMATICALLY YOY IS PROBABLY NOT SUPER REASONABLE. NEVERTHELESS, PROSPECTS FOR GROWTH BEING SLIM MEANS BAD TIMES WHEN DEBT GETS PRICEY.\n* Total revenue increased by $26.0 million, or 1.9%, to $1.4 billion from fiscal 2018. DO YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REVENUE AND NET INCOME? WHO AM I KIDDING. OF COURSE YOU DON'T. SEE BELOW.\n* Net income increased by $44.7 million, or 99.8%, to a record $89.5 million from fiscal 2018.\u00a0REVENUE MINUS ALL LOSSES AND DEDUCTIONS EQUALS NET INCOME.\n* Adjusted EBITDA increased by $55.6 million, or 13.9%, to a record $456.9 million from fiscal 2018.\u00a0EBITDA IS A MAGIC NUMBER THAT LETS COMPANIES STACK THE DECK AGAINST BANKS USING SQUIRRELY ACCOUNTING TECHNIQUES TO PAINT A ROSIER PICTURE OF THEIR FINANCIAL POSITION THAN IS ACCURATE. DON'T BELIEVE ME? LOOK AT THE DEFINITION IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. THAT SUCKER IS LIKE 3 PAGES LONG. AND THAT'S A SHORT ONE IN TODAY'S MARKET. IT MEANS EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AND AMORTIZATION. WHAT THEY DON'T TELL YOU IN YOUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE BUSINESS SCHOOL IS THAT IN THE REAL WORLD THIS INCLUDES SHIT YOU DID 2 YEARS AGO, SHIT YOU HAD A DREAM ABOUT THAT ONE TIME, AND PAYMENTS TO THE CEO'S WIFE'S BOYFRIEND'S SECRET FAMILY IN OMAHA USING ADD-BACKS, CARRY-FORWARDS AND RUN RATE MECHANICS THAT DON'T MAKE ANY SENSE IN REAL LIFE. FOR EXAMPLE, LAST FISCAL YEAR THEY INCLUDED $5.5 MILLION OF EXECUTIVE PARACHUTE PAYMENTS AS AN OFFSET AGAINST CAPITAL LOSSES. YUP. YOU'RE NOT IN FUCKING KANSAS ANYMORE. WELCOME TO THE MAJOR LEAGUES.\n\nThis actually isn't too bad. The business runs at a profit (albeit a skinny one boosted by an outlier year) and is growing slowly. The bat-flu, however, is a major fucking spanner in the works. Zero attendance means zero sales. If you're $SIX, you close the park. But because $SEAS' businesses involve live animals, they can't just shut it down even though they can't sell tickets. And it's not like they can throw Willy in with the dolphins and expect them to play nice. They've got ongoing upkeep costs for shark food, dolphin poop tank cleaning, fucking whale vets. What does this mean? Say it with me now.\n\nNegative cashflow. Ding ding ding. These are magic words to people like me. Smells like opportunity.\n\nIf you're interested, keep digging in the 10-K. It's a rabbit hole without a cute blonde and a white bunny at the end, so YMMV. But right now what you need to know is that they probably don't have much free cash (they've been clearing \\~4.0% profits for the last decade pre-2019). They also spent 84,178,000 on interest expense last year. Their debt is not that pricey but there's a lot of it. This is a good segue.\n\n**$SEAS Debt (The hard part)**\n\nBefore we get started, don't get your panties in a twist. Debt isn't bad. That's an assumption a lot of people make. Debt can be great (even when it's expensive). It's only bad when (1) you can't afford it or (2) you won't be able to afford it SOON - meaning you shouldn't have had it in the first place.\n\nYour job now is to figure out three things. (1) What kind of debt structure do they have? (2) How much money do they have to pay to service it? and (3) Could they get more if they needed it?\n\nThe answer to question (1) is in the 10-K. CTRL+F Credit Agreement. Read a couple of lines down. Check there's nothing else. Bingo - we're in luck. No bonds. Less work for you. Reward yourself with a sip of that drink. Congratulate yourself on getting this far. Your mom and I are very proud. Now on with the show.\n\n$SEAS have a $1,523,389,000 term loan due March 31, 2024 and a $332,500,000 revolver due October 31, 2023. They upsized the revolver by $100m in Feb. Bet that bank has buyer's remorse now. Anyway.\n\nTeaching moment: The difference between a term loan and a revolver is that a term loan gets paid to you 100% up front and gets paid 100% back at the end. Normally it's for 7 years - this one is a bit shorter. This is sometimes called a 'bullet' loan. You pay interest on the loan plus 'amort' - this is mandatory interest payable on the whole lot at the end (typically 0.25%). A revolver isn't just a prop in a Clint Eastwood movie. It's like a corporate credit card. You can draw as much as you like and then pay it back - and then you can borrow it again. A unique feature of revolvers is that you can also draw either in cash or letters of credit (like a performance guarantee issued by a bank in favor of a third party on your behalf - you pay extra interest and an upfront fee for the privilege). Normally the credit agreement lasts for 5 years. Check the definition of \"Maturity Date\" to find out when these are due.\n\nNow, according to the 10-K, they've got $20 mill in L/Cs drawn plus $50m odd drawn in cash. This leaves $250m or so left in that facility to take out of the great big shark-shaped ATM in the lobby if they need to. At the moment, a shitload of corporates are tapping their revolvers to help with cashflow problems, and I bet $SEAS is no exception. This means they've got wiggle room if they get squeezed. Good to know. Banks can sometimes try and stop you from doing this when there is bad shit in the market (this is called a \"material adverse change\" or \"Event of Default\" blocker and you can find it by googling either of those terms in Section 2 of the Credit Agreement, which deals with borrowings) but it would be pretty ballsy of their lenders to pull this 4 weeks after they had no problem giving them an extra $100 mill, so I think we can write that prospect off.\n\nLet's talk about (2). Pricing. I'm not going to explain LIBOR to you because it'll go away soon anyway but for our purposes what you need to know is that whenever you see an \"L+\" in a pricing grid it means LIBOR PLUS the number after it. In this case, they're paying L+300 basis points for the term loan and L+275 basis points for the revolver, with a sliding scale based on their credit rating. Let's assume it's L+275. Find this under the definition of \"Applicable Margin\". This accounts for their great big interest expense. It's payable quarterly, so they're going to be stung, but they'll be able to get through it - they are probably paying about $20 mill a quarter in interest and like we said above, they've got at least $250m to play with if they need to. That said, if the parks don't reopen for more than another quarter, this could get ugly fast. More money drawn means more interest payable.\n\nSo now we can look at (3). Can they get more debt from other lenders? Here's the tricky part.  NEGATIVE COVENANTS. Remember, the rule with these documents is you can't do anything EXCEPT. So we need to find the exceptions to incurring additional debt. These live in the 'Indebtedness' sections of the negative covenants in the Credit Agreement, which are nearly always in Section 7. Normally debt lives in 7.03. Found it? Good. Let's see what they can do.\n\nTeaching moment. Lots of you asked yesterday how they could incur extra debt from \\*other banks\\* even if they're allowed to - why a bank would want to lend money to a bad company or a company heading into troubled waters. The answer is simple: money. Higher risk lending means they can charge a higher price. And remember, they're going to immediately de-risk by selling the debt to someone else. Literally can't go tits up for them (until it does for the bagholder, but that's someone else's problem).\n\nBack to the technicals. Covenants have dedicated 'baskets'. Each one of those little paragraphs is a different exception and they can use most of them independently of each other. Some are for normal shit - like sale leasebacks or whatever. Some are more general. That's what we're looking for. Sometimes there's even a provision which lets you mix and match the baskets when you run out of room in one by using the extra in another. This is called \"reclassification\" and is for our more advanced students to worry about. Find it by CTRL+F \"reclass\". hint: $SEAS has this feature.\n\nAnyway. Job 1 is finding the 'freebie' or 'unconditional' basket. It's normally the shortest one and says something like \"Aggregate Indebtedness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries in an amount to not exceed $X\". Ours is in 7.03(m). It's $175 million. That's good!\n\nThe other key basket for general use is called incremental or accordion debt. We talked about this yesterday. This bit is much more complicated. Here's the explainer. This is debt incurred at a similar level of seniority which is taken to be treated the same way as the credit agreement debt in terms of priority. They get all the benefits of the protections without the need to stress about being part of the original bank group. Banks don't like this - borrowers LOVE it. You get a limited amount of this. It's often called an 'Incremental Cap', an 'Available Amount', or - as in this case - a 'Cumulative Credit'. You get a starter basket - a set figure - then you get rewarded by getting more in this bucket as your performance improves in other areas. These are the 'builder amounts'. Look in the definition to see what I'm talking about. Anyway. Here they get $325 million to start with, plus whatever else is available in the cumulative credit definition. From the 10-K explainer they don't have any other incremental debt, so we can assume that this is fully available. CTRL+F \"incremental\" in the Credit Agreement to learn more.\n\nTL;DR? $SEAS can incur a shitload of additional debt. Cashflow secured, right? Wrong.\n\n**Financial Covenants (Extra credit)**\n\nA financial covenant is a special rule that says you need to keep a certain ratio - measuring some kind of fiscal performance - in line with a set figure, or lenders can call in the debt and make you pay it all back at once. Now, most of the time, these don't apply to term loans in 2020, just revolvers, and that's the case here too. Just CTRL+F \"Financial Covenant\" to find it. In today's market, covenants aren't 'fixed' like they used to be though (that is, apply all the time). Instead, they're 'springing' - they get keyed off a certain event - like tapping too much of a revolver (here, it's 35%).\n\nFound it? Good. For $SEAS, it says that they're not allowed to go above a 6.25:1.00 First Lien Secured Leverage Ratio. This means the ratio of their debt to their equity can't go above 6.25x (this is what 'leverage' is - no, not what your wife uses to get you to do her boyfriend's laundry) - or they'll need to pay back their revolver. This causes something of a domino effect - the revolver getting called in would mean the TL lenders could call the TL in (this is called a 'cross-default'). So they need to be careful with the revolver covenant compliance.\n\nWhat does this mean? Use your noodle. Would they rather tap excess revolver and risk covenant breach, or just go out and get spicey incremental debt? Probably the latter. That's going to be expensive. They're going to get into some dire straits quickly if they can't reopen. And where does that $1.5bn in repayments come from?\n\nWhat does this mean for the ticker? Again, use your fucking noodle. I don't give advice for free.\n\n**TL;DR (Can't help those that won't help themselves)**\n\nSPY $69 4/20 blaze it. Read *Under the Volcano.*\n\nGood luck out there autists.
