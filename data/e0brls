We have many brothers and sisters and lovers here in wsb who are about to be homeless and wife-less because of the ill-fated tesla price drop today. What if we all preorder the cyberpunk truck for right fuckin now to help fellow bag holders out? If you have kids preorder in their name as well. Dead relatives, unborn babies everybody deserve a preorder of cybertruck. If time of need lets band together. We will call  this the Operation CyberMusk. Many generation will remember your sacrifice and shared common mission. Wait no more. Pre-order tesla Cyber truck. \n\n\n\n\n\n(this is meant as joke and not a real investment advice.
