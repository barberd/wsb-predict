{"id": "g2l87b", "title": "Will AMZN puts be free money?", "selftext": "AMZN reports earnings on Thursday. Here's what we know:\n\n1.) AMZN is a strong coronavirus name because people can shop from home\n\n2.) Revenue and EPS will still probably not meet expectations because just because people CAN spend money from home doesn't mean they ARE spending money from home. 21 million of these people don't have jobs anymore.\n\n3.) Of the people who have lost their jobs and are getting unemployment, for a significant amount of them they are actually making MORE money than before. Does that mean they've been, and will continue to, splurge on Amazon?\n\n4.) A significant chunk of AMZN's revenue is from AWS. How will small businesses closing affect that revenue stream?\n\n5.) AMZN hit $2450 today. By far an ATH. Last earnings AMZN blew results away and the stock moved up 10%, but it still started selling off from that peak a few days later and a few days before the entire market started really selling off on coronavirus news.\n\nMy conclusion from the above information, is that AMZN is currently priced as a company that will be not just more profitable, but MUCH more profitable during the coronavirus pandemic. I think it's more likely that AMZN will either be slightly more profitable than normal, or slightly less profitable than normal.\n\nIf that's the case AMZN has probably moved too far too fast and is overpriced. A short term correction down to $2150 post earnings is likely as traders take profit from the **41% run up** it's had over the last month.\n\n**The Play:** While you could choose to buy an FD on Thursday, you would probably be better off waiting until after the overnight earnings move to enter into any play. If they gap up on earnings you'll know that I was wrong and can choose not to enter the trade (though often these things pop on earnings and then sell off so that might even be the absolute best scenario to enter the trade). If they gap down on earnings it's likely more downside is imminent as those people who got that 41% run up see their profits evaporating and move quickly to take profit. If they go flat on earnings, the earnings catalyst is gone and we'll still likely see a lot of profit taking.\n\nPersonally I'm thinking of going $500 into an FD on Thursday (just one contract), and 5k on Friday 10% OTM puts expiry 5/15.  \n\n\n**Edit 1:** I realize you goldfish can only remember things that occurred over the last 24 hours and thus can't imagine what it could POSSIBLY be like for AMZN to go down. After all, it's gone up for the entirety of your memory. But believe it or not, AMZN has actually gone down in the past, and generally that happens after the hype wears off. Usually hype wears off after the catalysts for higher price movements have gone (that's earnings you dumbshits).", "created_utc": 1587063694.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2l87b/will_amzn_puts_be_free_money/", "is_self": true}
