But the CEO was part of that ish-show hype.\n\nYet they claim $1.5BILLION in revenue. That's not nothing. $50 in revenue per share.\n\nOf course they aren't profitable. But will new CEO get things on track or reveal bullshit is even worse than initially being reported?\n\n52 Week Range 8.96 - 31.05\n\nIV is a high, +100%\n\nIV percentile is 99%.\n\nWhich makes sense. This company could be $30 or $0 within a year.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/quote/OSTK?p=OSTK\n\nAnyone trading this or have thoughts?", "created_utc": 1566834459, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cvpti2/overstock_ceo_news_vs_fundamentals_ostk/", "is_self": true}
