{"id": "gh50h7", "title": "Long term strangle for commercial real estate companies.", "selftext": "I'm looking at $SPG and $BX specifically.  The market doesn't seem to know what to do with either of these companies.   Both are significantly down from their pre-rona highs.  I'm a high grade idiot, so I don't know what to do with them either, but a dimly formed idea has made it's way into my mind.\n\nScenario 1.  Shitshow.\n\nThe bears are right.  Half of small business BK, social distancing is restablished after a brief, orgasmic rush to socialize in the next few weeks by mouth agape Karens and Tactical Butterball Gun Rapists in the US drive new Rona cases through the roof, surviving companies, looking to save money, let go of their leases.  Office workers can work from home for the foreseeable future so office space is a logical place to cut costs.  A new WFH paradigm emerges among the white collar glass, commercial real estate values completely eat shit. Malls, already on the ropes from a decade of online shopping, become ghost towns.\n\n\nScenario Two. - Everybody was over reacting.\n\nAntibody testing becomes reliable and widespread, ultimate death rate turns out to be .5%. 40% of people are asymptomatic.  Old fucks still have to stay inside, but for everyone else, it's playtime.  People rush back outside to lick each other in their exuberance. Both $SPG (malls) and $BX (office space) rise to pre rona levels.\n\n\nEither way, I think we're going to see a LOT of movement in these two stocks, specifically.  Can someone with a more functional form of retardation explain to me why I shouldn't take some strangles of these two companies in my portfolio expiring in January?", "created_utc": 1589129729.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gh50h7/long_term_strangle_for_commercial_real_estate/", "is_self": true}
