Know thee not that the market is unquestionable? Infallible, omniscient, omnipresent? Knoweth that thine autism is an affront to the efficient market at the center of the world, of which you are only a fraction of a fraction. Thine misdeeds have been punished by the great market who cares not for your temporary options - for these are delusions of wayward minds - there is only one market and its direction is known only to its own perfect nature. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nUltimate authority for gains and losses rest only in the desires of the market. Reject thine desire to contemplate on the nature of the great axel which turneth the world. It is not for thee to knoweth. Worry not about that which rules the tides of wealth and prosperity. Have faith and yee shall be rewarded. Invest with trust in the great efficient market and be disturbed not by days of red, for it is written that in the next world that yachts await you all floating upon endless seas of green. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are but a mote in the eye of SPY, and all your ponderous considerations and calculations pale before the ineffable market. Hear yee not the cries of it's prophets on Earth? Consider the words of those who have bathed deep and long in the faith that the market shall bear us all forward into the bright future which is promised. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPray, sinners that your transgressions may be forgiven. Your idle speculations on the movements of the market are an affront to its very nature. In the end, only ruin and margin calls shall await you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnquestionable are the candles of green and red. Unknowable are the fluctuations of the Holy's many persons. But, taketh heart that S&P, NASDAQ, and DOW shall bring tendies to the faithful and punish those who presume to understand their ways.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: You cannot stand before the perfect conception of the holy market. It is foolish to try. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nStop thine errant ways before financial ruin and an eternity spent in debt consumes thee. Also, read the first letter of each paragraph, you fucking nerds.", "created_utc": 1585952133.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fuhqzm/a_reading_from_the_book_of_efficient_markets_43/", "is_self": true}
