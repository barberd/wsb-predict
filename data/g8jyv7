Here\u2019s a long term play that has a decent shot at coming to fruition: \n\n\nPeople aren\u2019t doing shit this quarantine. Millions of people are going to get super fat in quarantine watching their wife\u2019s boyfriend fuck them. When we have a vaccine things stabilize in a year or so, people realize they\u2019re fat fucks and start going to gyms again. Planet fitness runs aggressive campaigns and deals to get people in the door. But people do what they always do, go three times and then that membership card never sees the light of day. But it doesn\u2019t matter, cause they keep charging their $10 and people never even notice. Buy these after the market finally shits itself and in the end stonks go up and you print tendies. \n\n[DD](https://www.fool.com/amp/investing/2018/07/30/planet-fitness-is-a-cash-machine.aspx)\n\ntl;dr PLNT $125c 1/21/22", "created_utc": 1587927015.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g8jyv7/long_term_plnt_yolo/", "is_self": true}
