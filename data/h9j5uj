For the latest months data (May) there were over 3 MILLION background checks run. It\u2019s not a direct comparable but this loosely means there were roughly 3 million firearms transaction in that month. Third highest ever recorded (March 2020 and December 2015 were higher). The clear trend is that these purchases are only increasing over the short term.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/CWCfQB5.gif](https://i.imgur.com/CWCfQB5.gif)\n\nSource: [FBI NICS records](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/nics_firearm_checks_-_month_year.pdf/view)\n\nThe FBI has provided a handy \u2018Top 10\u201d list and half of \u2018highest days\u201d and \u2018highest weeks\u2019 on record happened in 2020. Likely you\u2019ll see a few more 2020 on that list by the end of the year.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/cAslVO0.png](https://i.imgur.com/cAslVO0.png)\n\n**Election Years**\n\nCommon fact that election years always see a spike in gun sales as the NRA and Republicans always fear monger their base into thinking the next Democrat is going to take away all of their freedoms and surprise it works. Gun sales are again spiking in 2020.\n\nWhy was this election years panic buying delayed compared to 2016?\n\nIn 2016 no one thought Trump was going to win and Hillary aka satan was going to take everyones guns away so people started buying earlier since the \u201cwriting was on the wall\u201d. But whoopsies CNN and MSNBC got it wrong and guns were safe for another 4 years and sales declined.\n\nIn 2020 the polls and \u2018experts\u2019 assumed Trump basically had his reelection in the bag given how the economy was harder than a teenager on Viagra and was his to lose\u2026 and he lost it. COVID-19 tanking the economy with record unemployment and his attacks on protestors, stupid shit posted on twitter, all while threatening to deploy the US military has given Sleepy Joe a 10 point average lead in the polls by doing nothing but hide in his basement. So now everyone that thought their guns were safe are once again panic buying in earnest.\n\n2020 is a bit different than years past in that Gun Control is a major part of the democratic policy platform that they are campaigning on. Francis O\u2019Rouke in the primaries only had one policy that he was campaigning on and that was gun control with his famous [\"Hell, yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.\"](https://www.npr.org/2019/09/12/760386808/orourke-promises-to-take-your-ar-15-but-americans-are-split-on-buybacks)\n\nGuess who Joe Biden picked to lead his gun control initiative? It rhymes with \u2018Pork\u2019. Here\u2019s a few tid bits from [Sleepy Joe\u2019s gun control platform](https://joebiden.com/gunsafety/)\n\n\u00b7 Ban the manufacture and sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines\n\n\u00b7 Regulate possession of existing assault weapons under the National Firearms Act\n\n\u00b7 Buy back the assault weapons and high-capacity magazines\n\n\u00b7 Reduce stockpiling of weapons\n\n**How does an anti-gun presidential candidate help sell guns?**\n\nThe greatest gun salesman in American history was good ole [Barrack Hussein Obama](https://ammo.com/articles/obama-greatest-gun-salesman-in-america-infographic) and all he ever did was issue press conferences and talk a big talk but never actually did anything. Fun Fact: Donald Trump has issued more gun control edicts than Obamas entire presidency, but facts don\u2019t matter, only perception does. People actually believe that the string pullers behind Joe Biden will go hard on gun control (but the NRA says that every election).\n\nBasically, I\u2019m saying there is a high probability that if Joe Biden wins the election he\u2019ll replace Obama as the greatest firearms salesman of all time and there will be a whole lot of gun buying leading up to that.\n\nAlright you\u2019ve convinced me the world sucks and people are scared and buying lots of guns.\n\n**How do you play this?**\n\nNot to many names to choose from but we have 2 publicly traded companies that sell guns directly to the public and both have seen some big short term rallies, but there\u2019s a lot of juice left in these names and the election is only going to create more gun & ammo buying. Both these names haven\u2019t hit their 2016 peaks (last presidential election) and I think there\u2019s enough other shit going on to help these names surpass those 2016 peaks due to new gun buyers (not seen in 2016) and panic buying because protests, rioters, and cops being terrible in additional to the normal and expected right wing buyers every election year. If we use 2016 as an example we see a trend upward as buying intensifies and then with the surprise Trump win a massive drop and then a continued trend down through his presidency as people stop panic buying.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/EuOdsD3.png](https://i.imgur.com/EuOdsD3.png)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/b5lMPPu.png](https://i.imgur.com/b5lMPPu.png)\n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019ve done with the expectation that I\u2019ll be buying more as the election cycle heats up.\n\n**TLDR; Gun play SWBI 7/17 22.5c and RGR 7/17 80c if you have balls of steel oryou can go longer dated and holding through the election.**\n\n**Thanks for the tip asshole these names have already stonked\u2026**\n\nLogic dictates that if you buy a gun you\u2019ll buy ammo next. On top of that the panic buying of ammo goes hand in hand with the panic buying of guns. The hoarding of ammo is part of the American dream. The popular .223 and 5.56 rifle round has doubled in price since the end of 2019. The little 22lr has tripled in price.\n\nAmmo.com did a special news update that ammo sales are through the roof from COVID. [Directly from their site](https://ammo.com/coronavirus-impact-on-ammunition-sales)\n\n\u00b7 602% increase in revenue\n\n\u00b7 511% increase in transactions\n\n\u00b7 242% increase in site traffic\n\n\u00b7 84% increase in conversion rate\n\n\u00b7 16% increase in average order value\n\nWe\u2019re seeing the news report on this all over the country and this trend will only continue as we ramp up into election season. Couple examples.\n\n['Ammo is really a scarcity:' Iowa gun stores feel effects of coronavirus hoarding](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/2020/03/18/iowa-gun-stores-feel-effects-coronavirus-hoarding/5060889002/)\n\n[Panic At The Gun Shop](https://www.forbes.com/sites/halahtouryalai/2020/03/24/panic-at-the-gun-shop-coronavirus-fears-cause-a-run-on-ammo-and-firearms/#69d19fa8782e)\n\n[Floridians stockpiling guns and ammo amid national crises](https://www.wctv.tv/content/news/Floridians-stockpiling-guns-and-ammo-amid-national-crises-570992951.html)\n\nYou can bet all the major ammo suppliers are operating at full capacity to try and meet this new found demand. Federal Premium Ammo posted on facebook a pic of their president in the shop loading ammo into boxes. Obviously a PR stunt but point being demand for ammo is up.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/BcvLnIU.png](https://i.imgur.com/BcvLnIU.png)\n\nThe two biggest retail ammo manufacturers in the country are Federal Premium and Winchester owned by Vista Outdoor (VSTO) and Olin (OLN) respectively. Both of these names haven\u2019t stonked like the others and will likely see uplift from ammo sales but there\u2019s a catch. Winchester Ammo segment for OLN represents 10-15% of EBITDA for the company so even if ammo sales is through the roof the rest of the business may choke on COVIDS donkey dong tempering said uplift from ammo sales.\n\nVSTO has higher exposure in that Federal Ammo represents 2/3rds of their sales but the other 1/3rd of the business is golf, camping, and camelbak gear that no one gave a shit about during COVID but could potentially see a resurgence in demand with lockdowns being lifted across the country.\n\n**TLDR; Ammo Play is VSTO 11/20 15c and if you understand chemical jargon that I don\u2019t OLN 8/21 15c**\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1592237081.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h9j5uj/how_to_trade_societal_collapse/", "is_self": true}
