{"id": "gkgw0q", "title": "DD: Oil Futures Expiry on Tuesday 5/19", "selftext": "TL;DR Recent bull run on oil might offer an opportunity for a quick short (SCO is a 2x inverse ETF for real aggressive moves)\n\nOil futures contracts expire on the 3rd tuesday of every month (5/19). The negative oil futures last month were entirely due to retail flooding into USO (which at the time only rollover purchases to next month). USO restructured (now purchasing more futures 2+months out) so the chance of negative futures is far less than last month (but still possible).  Look at how retail investors learned the word \"contango\" and then quickly popped back into USO  because they think oil is a good long term investment.\n\nOil rebounded 300% since April's futures expiry. US demand is growing but it's still low by comparison to preCOVID activities. While China numbers are optimistic, and the country is \"opening up,\" many consumers are still fearful to participate in regular life activities. Oil has historically surged in the summer, a trend that may not hold with the drop in travel. US producers are sending some oil to Belarus, but rumors are Russia hasn't been meeting their promised production cuts.\n\nThe negative prices from last month caused a surge of unexpected demand to open up. Mobilizing floating storage (tankers), idling pipelines as stationary storage, and [commodity traders finding their own storage](https://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/news/negative-oil-prices-caused-trader-buying-25000-oil-barrels-2020-5-1029201266) all contributed to the quick rebound. My guess is that everyone who had the ability to store oil on an emergency basis likely did so last month when things plummeted. How many WSB posts did you see about people trying to figure out unconventional ways to get paid to take delivery of 1000 barrels? This probably led to an actual inventory capacity exceeding what was listed before and we probably exhausted this unconventional storage last month.\n\nOil prices surged this week on estimates of an surprise [3.5 million barrells of draw](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Oil-Prices-Jump-On-Surprise-Crude-Inventory-Draw.html). However, [50 million barrels of Saudi Oil are arriving](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/saudi-oil-rush-threatens-disrupt-172012215.html) which can overwhelm any production cuts made recently.\n\n64% of oil use is in transportation.  Airlines cut flights by 90% last month, but this might not have been reflected in oil prices because airlines often hedge futures to create stable fuel prices.  Now that they've had 2 months of this new reality, they will probably adjust their hedging behavior.\n\nAlso, general bear trend this week, JPow speaking Sunday at 7pm, FED issuing warning at EOD Friday,  and a weekend full of other news might drive the market down anyways.", "created_utc": 1589574629.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gkgw0q/dd_oil_futures_expiry_on_tuesday_519/", "is_self": true}
