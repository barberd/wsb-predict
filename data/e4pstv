I told her I wouldn't go to the mall but then I thought about all the insider information I'd get from actually being inside stores so I said I'd go. \n\nFirst thing we see when we pull up to the Macy's at the mall, bunch of fucking garbage outside in their bushes.  Plastic bags, bottles, other shit, I was like mom what the fuck is Macy's on rn.  They got hella people inside, and not one poor fucker can go out and pull the shit off their bushes?  So we rolled through mad quick because there were just way too many red dresses and I'm a dude so like I'm not trying to be like that.  Short em, they're dying.\n\nWe head over to Tommy Hilfiger's.  Now idk if any of you have been unfortunate enough to walk into a TH store, but holy shit I have never seen an uglier collection of clothing.  There were like these sleeveless puffer vests that had these rainbow-plaid patterns all over that I have never seen a single soul wearing.  I actually stayed in Hilfiger's more than other stores because I was just in so much amazement at how ugly their shit was. Short the fuck out of em.\n\nAnyway, tried Ralph Lauren, wasn't a 65 year old golf-bro so I left. They're so fucking boring, Iron Condor is the play.\n\nEventually I just walked past an American Eagle, saw a decent looking jacket, walked in, it was 60% off, bought it and left. Long AEO, profit margins may be tight tho.\n\nNow I would make these plays before next earnings calls myself, but my RH has 28 cents left down from 1300 bucks so hopefully someone else can capitalize on this dd.\n\nTl;Dr: Short Macy's, Short Tommy Hilfiger's, Ralph Lauren is boring as fuck, Long AEO (but maybe don't).", "created_utc": 1575242777, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e4pstv/i_went_to_the_mall_with_my_mom_so_you_didnt_have/", "is_self": true}
