[https://ibb.co/TRSCRyC](https://ibb.co/TRSCRyC)\n\nThe guy above did more research than many of you cellphone traders.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's some forward guidance, this is the REAL recession watch: ANFCI\n\n[https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/nfci/index](https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/nfci/index)\n\nBut it's half the story, you already know that geopolitics and macroeconomics are all that matter in markets, the rest is just poetry.  The effect they have on player psychology decides the degree of winners and losers.  The pandemic is as real in the minds of individuals, institutions, and nations as it is under a microscope.\n\nLet's look at geopolitics and the psychology intersect.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **The tests.**  Yes, there aren't enough tests.  And its probably because they estimated that the 'panic multiplier' of knowing that 100s of thousands (or millions) of people have SARS-lite is a net negative.  That's right, a government with mountains of secrets thinks transparency is bad.  There is absolutely no benefit to the federal government from you knowing just how bad things are, and panicking.  This shouldn't be surprising.  If 'police state' was a tradable asset, it would be a 50+ bagger (that's 1 bag per year). *This is a neutral outcome.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* There is a strong chance that nearly half of us will get sick at some point this year.  This might become a new type of recurring flu.  And, like other SARS derivatives, there might **NOT** be an effective vaccine.  SARS is special.  Apparently, people eating strange animals have only produced coronaviruses in the past several decades. *A big negative.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Europe/Japan are running out of basis points to deduct.  Remember citizen, real patriots are consoomers.\n* The US is very unhealthy, rampant obesity is part of our healthcare problem.  Before you complain about the evil 1%, try 1% less body fat first.\n* Overall, we probably won't have a low .6% CFR like South Korea.\n* It might be a few multiples worse than the average flu season.  *More big negatives.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* We could lose several politicians.  I couldn't possibly comment on whether that would be a net positive or a net negative.  But I was sad when Littlefinger died.\n\nCandidate cheat cards (in order of 2020 odds):\n\n1. Donald Trump: 'never been sick, has the best health'\n2. Joe Biden: 'had Cornflu in the 70s'\n3. Bernie Sanders: 'free healthcare unless you pay taxes'\n\nMarket has already priced in these actors (except maybe Bernie). *Neutral.*\n\n*Overall prognosis is increasingly negative.*  If markets psychologically somehow come to terms with this in the next 2 months or less, there is a slim chance we might dodge a real GFC event.  We have a lot of air time, so we can afford to fall for a while.  I can't say the same about many others.  There won't be a V recovery, or a W recovery, or a U recovery; especially for Europe/Japan/China.  **Keep an eye on that little ANFCI line, that's the airtime.**  If you're sitting on cash, that is your market timing device for entry after the crash.  The conservative take is this: **it's not a matter of whether a country will dodge a crash, but if they actually have a chance of bouncing back big later.**  I can think of at least 1 country with ~~high-interest rates~~ and a global reserve currency that could bounce back.\n\nThere's gonna be a lot of losing to come.  Fields of pink and all that.\n\nRedditors are addicted to stress, negativity, and drama.  In general, overexposed to insecurities.  They take a losing position and they always make it worse than it should be.  I mean that metaphorically and literally.  Which is why I wish there was a redditor sentiment index, so I could inverse.  Markets are resilient because greedy people run the show, it's a bias you can count on.  If anything, panic increases greed.\n\nIn the meantime, I'm holding orange juice and rough rice and hiding out in the Denver airport.", "created_utc": 1584324678.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjd8zv/pandemic_psychology/", "is_self": true}
