Their President and CEO was recently added to the NYSE Board Advisory Council, which should help bring this little known GIANT into the limelight.  I don't have much time for a long write up, since the job is calling.\n\nOriginal DD:  [Link to OG TAK DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7x5r3/repost_takeda_tak_dd_from_your_friendly_wsb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)\n\nHere is the link I reference:  [Takeda CEO Added to NYSE Board](https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/20/05/b15953603/nyse-board-advisory-council-welcomes-eight-new-members)\n\nIn addition, I would highly suggest you check out the list of expected FDA decisions and clinical trial announcements on BioPharm Catalyst:  [I pay for this, I get more info than you likely will see](https://www.biopharmcatalyst.com/calendars/fda-calendar)\n\nAnyways, their revenue will likely annihilate expectations, and their EPS likely will too.  They have partnered with Seattle Genetics for numerous ONC products (check their last earnings), and the licensing deal will provide a great deal of revenue.  Throw in some PR from joining the NYSE advisory board and we may finally see TAK get the credit and limelight it deserves (vs. say a worthless company like Gilead...chumps).\n\nAnyways, watch SPY, it can drag down TAK since volume isn't high on TAK itself.  The index does pull it down quite often.  Nonetheless, **earnings is 5/13**, I'd start jumping into ATM calls for 6/19 and keep adding to those LEAPs any chance you get!  They have ADD/ADHD market on lock and many other neuro disorders.  Throw in IVIg/SubQ Ig, their other high priced blood products, the fact that they Shkreli-hiked the price of colchicine (and some other US products), and you have a recipe for a MASSIVE earnings + revenue beat.\n\nTAK 5/15 $12.50c, TAK 1/15/21 $20-25c, HALO 6/19 $25c, CLVS 6/19 $10c, DTIL 12/18 $10c, SCYX 12/18 $2.50c.  Good luck, and do your own research.  I'm just a moron like everybody else, this is not financial advice, just pointing you in the right direction.", "created_utc": 1588714001.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ge6jxl/followup_on_takeda_tak_dd_from_your_friendly_wsb/", "is_self": true}
