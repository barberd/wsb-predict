His former campaign associate George Nader just plead guilty to child porn and a bunch of other awful shit.  His other buddy Lev just gave the contents of three phones to the HSPCI and the dude's lawyer is tweeting memes at various republican congressman. Senate is about to allow witnesses in impeachment trial. Trump is pumping the market short term with his \"what are you doing wrong?\" tweet a couple days back, and now all his lemmings are frantically calling their 409k brokers and asking to rotate their retirement accounts to 100% stonks exposure. This will bid up underlying through fund inflows basically making the next couple weeks remain super retard bull market. Trump fully intends to P&amp;D this shit and will walk off with half the retirement savings of his cult and start his own fucking TV channel, and they will love him for it. He'll probably loan it back to them with interest. RemindMe! 6 weeks.", "created_utc": 1579019447, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eonjx6/trump_is_pd_before_he_bails/", "is_self": true}
