I did not know that you could not retroactively make the election. I always used tubotax and the application never mentioned anything about or gave the option to elect 475. In 2017 I made a 215% return on my account, $480k. I had a tax owed of 190k that I let slide into late 2018 as I was up around 90% with my trades for the year. During the market correction in  2018 September - December, My account went from around 1.65 million to $4,500. Yeah. I lost a million and a half bucks over about a month and the remainder of it over 2 months while the market sank lower. My net loss for the year was about 900k. I am now beign forced to find a second job just to pay my bills and afford a 72 month installment agreement with the irs, leaving me no room at all to save and try to trade again for the foreseeable future. If I had made this Section 475 (mark to market) election, my loss in 2018 would have cancelled out the 2017 tax debt and Id be fine. No, filling an Offer in compromise wont help, the IRS has 2 years to respond and even then given my income they would likely deny anything but the full payment. No I cant file bankruptcy, it doesn't fix back taxes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDont let yourself fuck up as bad as I did. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy first post on this account was like 6 months ago when i made the fuck up. yes this is real. real money. real gains. real losses. real fucking fucked.", "created_utc": 1557515406, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bn2e3o/if_you_are_actually_trading_make_sure_you_file_to/", "is_self": true}
