They have about 160b market cap, and contrary to most cloud company they are actually making money for some years now.\n\nMain competitors are SAP and Oracle, both decade-old corporate dinosaurs, loosing steam in the CRM market. Whatever happen with Rona virus, a good share of retail sales is moving online. Increasing online sales and weak competitors (for now) looks like the perfect combination for a booming revenue for Salesforce.\n\n**Why should you give a fuck ?**\n\nBecause Salesforce is one of theses companies whose revenue is actually expected to grow despite coronavirus. And while $CRM have experienced a sharp recovery since march, it still sits at \\~9% under its peak price. Considering that a fucking global pandemic actually increased the company revenue, it seems safe to say that the company value should soon at least meet it pre-rona level, whatever second-wave or lockdown in place.\n\nThe main potential issue is a sharp drop in projected earnings for 2020, from 1.1B to 120M, while revenue grow 50% to 17B. If that bother you, remember that time when you consider/buy/regret not buying calls on Fastly, a company that never pulled a profit in its whole existence.\u00a0\n\nearnings 05/28 so **It IS tO lATe tO pLaY tHe BuIlD uP**\n\nwell, the point is that $CRM have consistently beaten the expected EPS and will probably do it again. I entered my position last week but i still plan to hold it through the earnings because i do believe to a price hike after earnings. An expiry date far away enough from the earning date is also a good edge, giving price time to recover should it drop after earnings. And the price should recover because this company is actually in a better\u00a0market for its business now than 3 month ago. If you ever panic-sell in case of a drop after-earnings you get to keep the time value.\n\n**06/19 seems a good\u00a0compromise to me.**\n\nIs it risk free ? no. but if you are looking for risk-free trade here, you are retarded and you wife has a boyfriend.\n\n**my position :**\n\n06/19 180c; 06/19 182.5c; 06/19 185c (and yes I am down 20%. for now i'm cucked, but i stick to my plan)\n\nthe plan : hold through earnings, (reap the price hike), sell before 06/12.\n\nSalesforce have drop a bit today, so you get somewhat\u00a0cheaper calls:\n\n06/19 175c, 177.5c, 180c for a (somewhat) safe play\n\n180c for a higher risk and reward, lower capital play.", "created_utc": 1590565930.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/grfd7a/salesforcecom_a_case_for_crm/", "is_self": true}
