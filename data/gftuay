{"id": "gftuay", "title": "Anti-bioterror play for huge long-term gains", "selftext": "**Thesis:** SIGA Technologies, an anti-bioterror pharmaceutical company, will double their stock price in a year and triple or quadruple it in two years. i.e \\~$5.60 to $10-14 in 1 year, and $16-24 in 2 years. They are in an incredibly strong financial position: zero debt, future US government purchases that may be greater than their market cap, and low expenses for operations and forward research. They also have amazing future growth prospects as foreign governments will buy their meds to prepare for future pandemics. Their drugs treat smallpox which is both more contagious and deadly (IFR \\~30%!) than the Wuhan plague.\n\nDo you think absolutely no political or military leader will learn their lesson about pandemic preparedness? Do you think business leaders are going to put the pressure down since the cost of unpreparedness is orders of magnitude greater than preparedness? That\u2019s what this play is all about.\n\n**The play:** Buy $SIGA stocks and hold for 2 years. **DO NOT BUY CALLS**. There are no contracts available that are \"on thesis,\" the dates are too short and the volume is too slim.\n\n\\-> \"Hurr durr, go back to r/investing.\"\n\n\\-> Bro, I like y'all better than the investing squares and I'm happy to gamble on short plays when the fundamentals align with a short play. This is a low-risk opportunity to at least double your money by holding common stock for a year. Chill out and enjoy the ride. Feel free to sell OTM covered calls though to boost income--this is what I'm doing. If you gamble on this know that I'm taking the other side of your play.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Quick facts\u00a0\n\n**Stock price**: $5.71 at close yesterday\n\n**Market cap**: $470 million, a small cap, but not microcap. Not trying to pump and dump\u2014that\u2019s part of why I recommend stocks. They opened up 2.5% today, if you tards push them up over 3.5% today on no news, I\u2019m deleting this post so we don\u2019t attract more SEC/Bloomburger attention. I like this place and no amount of money is worth an FBI visit.\n\n**Style**: Value, when compared to other biotechs\n\n**Products**: Their primary product is an FDA approved oral antiviral (TPOXX) that treats all orthopox viruses (e.g. the dreaded smallpox). They are currently developing additional products for IV and pediatric treatment, another small molecule drug for treating orthopox viruses, and are developing therapeutics that use orthopox viruses for delivery of anticancer antigens.\n\n**How SIGA makes money**: 1) US government contracts to supply the Strategic National Stockpile, 2) US government contracts for research, 3) sales to foreign governments and potentially private parties. Note that their business doesn't care about prevailing market conditions and all of these are multi-year contracts.\n\n**Debt**: $0. They paid off an $86 MM loan in March.\n\n**Cash holdings**: $77.4 MM\n\n**Total assets**: $118.6 MM\n\n**Net cash flow 2019**: -$18.2 MM, as discussed below, 2019 was a transition year between govt contracts hence the low income. They made $400MM from closing contracts in 2018.\n\n**Net cash flow 2020, my estimate**: +$53 MM, see cash flow section below for how I got this figure\n\n**Technicals, RSI**: 57\n\n**Technicals, MACD**: 12 day moving average above 26 day until yesterday. Now overlapping.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My thoughts on upside, how this play can win:**\n\n\\- The US govt through BARDA accelerates their purchasing of TPOXX to be and look more prepared for future pandemics.\n\n\\-\u00a0**Foreign governments purchase TPOXX for their own pandemic preparedness**. Canada announced an intent to purchase in December. Others are likely to follow. IMO, the stock will hit $10 when 3 additional countries announce purchasing and $20 when they have a network of 10 purchasing countries plus additional research. The US gets a discount on TPOXX because they funded the initial research, others will likely pay three times as much per dose.\n\n\\-\u00a0The US govt offers much more research funding to SIGA to design antivirals for other possible pandemic viruses. 10 years ago they had a small BARDA contract to look into antivirals for Lassa fever. They might renew or add to this type of research.\n\n\\- TPOXX gets additional approvals for IV use and prophylactic use (i.e. give to people in contact with infected, first responders or first city) and US buys more.\n\n\\-\u00a0A larger pharmaceutical company announces that they will purchase SIGA for $10-$15 share in a year. \u00a0SIGA already has connections with Pfizer.\n\n\\- Large amounts of additional income help them pump with **stock buybacks or fat dividends**. I am totally convinced they are going to buyback or spit dividends in a year from now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My thoughts on downside/risks:**\n\n\\-\u00a0Foreign governments don\u2019t purchase TPOXX or don\u2019t approve its safety/efficacy and rely on the vaccine for smallpox (but 1 in 5 people can\u2019t take the vax and lots of deaths in first wave without TPOXX).\n\n\\-\u00a0US govt does not add to stockpile, only keeps refreshing expired TPOXX.\n\n\\-\u00a0US govt does not invest in additional pandemic preparedness research/invests only in competitors.\n\n\\-\u00a0TPOXX may later be discovered to have a severe side-effect. (Oral formula is already FDA approved though).\n\n\\-\u00a0If you buy calls, then you need foreign govts to get in on the action fast, but due to bureaucracies that is super unlikely IMO.\n\n\\- Valuations do not reflect fundamentals anymore as the price of $SPY makes evident. (Yes, I am a salty put holder).\n\n\\-\u00a0There\u2019s more risks listed in their 10-K, but I do not think they are significant enough to list here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Resources for your own DD\n\n**Do your own research.

Smallpox is a nasty disease. It's basic reproduction number, R0, is between 3-6, like the Wuhan coronavirus. It similarly has a 7-14 day lag time before symptoms show, although it not know to be infectious for the first several days.\n\nIt is also exceptionally deadly, ranging from 15-30% fatality rate depending upon the strain and in children and the elderly can reach a 75% mortality rate. Survivors are usually permanently scarred and may have life-long complications from the disease. A smallpox epidemic would actually make corona look like \"just the flu.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Infection around day 20 mark. Bangladesh, 1973.](https://preview.redd.it/94sofnbnghx41.jpg?width=560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c3c37aefdd6270d13453909564fe14de16e1d6b9)\n\nBioterrorism or biowarfare with smallpox is a massive threat to the military and people and an obvious first choice of weapon for a bioterrorist. Careful governments will plan for it.\n\n**Isn't smallpox eradicated?**\n\nYes. But. 1) There are still many samples across the world in government labs across the world. 2) The genome exists on computers in said labs. 3) Many other orthopox viruses exist such as cowpox and monkeypox. Monkeypox in particular has had more cases in subsaharan Africa in the last few years. There have even been small outbreaks in the US, UK, and Singapore within the last 20 years.\n\n**What about vaccines?**\n\n1. Maybe you recall that in the 1790\u2019s Edward Jenner discovered the first vaccine by giving people the milder cowpox to prevent smallpox. The state of the smallpox vaccine has not evolved significantly since then. The modern vaccine uses a two-prong poker to deliver a live smallpox virus that has been engineered to be very weak. However, it is still a real virus that can causes symptoms or spread the disease to others. One in five Americans have underlying conditions that prevent them from receiving this vaccine due to the symptoms it causes.\n2. What do you do when smallpox starts spreading rapidly?You need to be able to treat the potentially 100s of thousands of people who will be infected before the immunization takes effect. The US is well-prepared with the vaccine having 300 million doses, nearly enough for every American. \u00a0But you need a treatment as part of the defense strategy.\n3. TPOXX is in the process of being approved as a prophylactic. I.e. if smallpox were to spread then people could be given both the vaccine and TPOXX at the same time to make sure they don\u2019t get sick if they were exposed prior to vaccination. Prophylactic treatment could be extremely important to first-responders, military, and people in the most badly affected zones.\n\n# Fundamentals\n\nI am no expert in reading 10-K filings, but SIGA's 10-K is not too complicated. I encourage you to do your own DD before making this play and if you've never read a 10-K filing before this is a great one to cut your teeth on. SIGA only has one key product line and their debt is uncomplicated (nonexistent); the only tricky parts is following the government money.\n\n# Balance sheet from most recent 10-Q\n\n[Balance sheet](https://preview.redd.it/xlhcqy6kghx41.png?width=3145&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b318afc0867e52d99f73f6bca845d89fb762ff9)\n\nSo the things to look at here are:\n\n1. SIGA has plenty of **cash**. Enough for two years operating expenses without any sort of austerity. Even if the economic downturn affected their business model, they would weather it easily.\n2. They have $16 MM in **inventory**. That\u2019s mostly TPOXX they\u2019ve already manufactured. This is great because it means they will have low costs for meeting the current BARDA contract supply request for this year and that if they get more orders they can dedicate their supply chain to filling them.\n3. **No debt**. There\u2019s no risk of them going tits up soon. Unlike your other favorite plays against highly-leveraged trash companies (looking at you Zillow), SIGA can ride out a credit crunch with ease.\n4. Stockholders\u2019 equity aka **book value**. At a price to book of 5:1 this is a cheap biotech company, one of the reasons I see them as a value buy. Also of note, their property includes patents on TPOXX in virtually every country.\n\n# Cash flow\n\nIn 2019, SIGA took a $7 million loss while in 2018 they punched a $422 million gain. How did that happen? Their entire business runs on multi-year govt contracts. 2018 saw an older BARDA contract end with the orders completely filled to stuff the strategic stockpile. 2019 was a transition year.They have a new contract with BARDA to replenish expiring TPOXX and research then purchase new formulations for IV and pediatric use. So, looking at their 201910-K their earnings look abysmal, but their forward looking earnings are much better given their recent news releases.\n\nLet\u2019s look more at that contract since it is a principal revenue source. SIGA\u2019s most recent 19C contract gives BARDA (Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority) the ability to purchase up to $602.5MM worth of product. The base contract guarantees $51.7 MM and BARDA announced the exercise of an additional $127.1 MM in purchasing for the next year as of a few weeks ago. Due to drug expiration and future preparedness, my opinion is that BARDA will exercise all of the purchasing options over the next 10 years.\n\nHere\u2019s my 2020 cash flow estimate, I am inexperienced at this sort of analysis. Pro 10-K readers, please give me some criticism.\n\n\\-$24 MM from expenses for sales, admin, research, services ,patents. Average of last 2 years -10% because research activity is shut down\n\n\\-$7 MM from additional costs of terminating loan. 10-Q\n\n\\+$2 MM from part 1 of Canadian order. Press release\n\n\\+$75 MM from three quarters of $101 MM exercise of BARDA contract. Estimated because they will supply TPOXX the next three quarters of 2020 and Q1 2021, press release\n\n\\-$3 MM additional costs to fulfill orders. Estimate from BARDA contract\u2019s allocation for supply costs\n\n$10 MM from contracts for research. Estimate by Q1 research revenue x 4\n\n$0 from stock buybacks and dividends, they have never had a dividend, but did do $800k in buybacks last year. They might have paid down their debt to put them in a position to do a lot more buybacks. $0 is a filler number.\n\nTotal: +$53 MM\n\nI expect the next few years to be cash flow positive now that they are out of the development phase and into the deployment phase. As they get additional international buyers they will also need to service their expiring stockpiles. This puts them at a forward price to earnings estimate of 10:1, still a value play in the current environment.\n\nThe high future cash flow is why I expect them to start pumping dividends or buybacks in a year. Since their research activities are primarily supported by the US government, they won't have other useful activities for the cash other than to return it to shareholders. Dividends and buybacks are a big factor in how many analysts calculate stock prices so either development will push the share price up a lot.\n\n# International Sales\n\nThis is where SIGA make us gigatendies. The US sales are the bread and butter that will keep them afloat for years to come. International sales are where they grow. Their contracts with the US government let them sell TPOXX at about $350 per course because they funded the initial research, whereas Canada is paying about $950 per course giving SIGA a massive estimated 95% margin.\n\nLet's see who might be interested in buying TPOXX as the China flu crisis unwinds: we've got most of western Europe/NATO--UK, France,Italy, Austria, Sweden, Switzerland, Germany, Spain; Pacific countries wary of being in the China sphere--Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Australia,Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia; and wealthy Middle Eastern countries that need to hedge against instability--Israel, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar; a smattering of other countries getting wise to viral threats--Russia, India,Brazil, South Africa, Mexico. That's a lot of potential buyers and it will only take a few for SIGA's stock to moon. Also note that SIGA does not market internationally themselves, they are partnered with Meridian, a Pfizer subsidiary, for international sales.\n\nSIGA also has an excellent moat internationally. They have patents for TPOXX and its analogs almost everywhere but China. Of course, there are still risks associated with international expansion, but the upside potential is yuuge. Let's hear it from the horse's mouth and see what SIGA had to say on their 2019 Q4 conference call:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Now let's discuss the international markets. The pursuit of international sales for oral TPOXX is a key focus for us at SIGA. Our partnership with Meridian Medical Technologies that we announced last June has been excellent. However as I've said many times the sales cycle is long for international government procurement of these types of products and each country has its own set of internal dynamics.  \n>  \n>...  \n>  \n>I have been asked why we do not provide a country-by-country update on sales progress. We do not comment on specific progress with countries for two main reasons. First, we respect the confidentiality of our customers who would not want their deliberations to become public. And second, we would not want to signal to competitors which countries may be undergoing an expansion in their spending for biodefense.  \n>  \n>With that context in mind, we are pleased to share a progress report regarding the Canadian military, who announced in December and intend to issue contracts to support a Health Canada, regulatory filing and thep urchase of up to 15,825 courses of oral TPOXX for the Canadian military.  \n>  \n>A procurement order of this size would represent about 25%of the active military forces in Canada. Although this is a relatively modest number of courses it is precedent for military preparedness by a U.S. NATO ally.\n\nWhat can we gather from that? They've got multiple sales in the works, but are keeping mum about it. Also, that it takes time to cut through government tape and announce these sales. Here's the single largest risk for this play: that it takes too long for international contracts to be announced. For this reason, I recommend buying stocks and not calls. The near term future is too unpredictable.\n\n# Research Activities\n\nSIGA's main drug, oral TPOXX, is already completely FDA approved as safe in humans and effective in animals. A quirk of their niche is that since smallpox is eradicated, they can't ethically test the drug for effectiveness in humans. This helps their bottom line because they basically get to skip some of the trials of a typical drug development cycle.\n\nSIGA's most important upcoming products are TPOXX for IV, liquid pediatric, and prophylactic use. Due to the current pandemic, all human trials are postponed, but the barriers for these trials are quite low. They only need to demonstrate human safety for the alternate ROA drugs. For prophylactic TPOXX, SIGA needs to demonstrate that TPOXX does not interfere with immunity acquisition from the smallpox vaccine. That way a potentially exposed person can both be treated and vaccinated at the same time. If they fail to meet these research goals, then I doubt the BARDA contract will be exercised for full value. Because of the delay in these results due to corona, I am not sure that they threaten the trade that I'm proposing.\n\nOrthopox viruses to deliver cancer therapeutics and older Lassa fever antivirals. I honestly don't know enough about their activities in these areas to make a comment. I think they are irrelevant to the base play, but could provide some surprise upside if there was a development.\n\n# Insider trading\n\nThe execs did more selling than buying last year which is perhaps bearish, but their most recent move was to buy a lot of stock in December after announcing the Canada deal. They sold stock just above SIGA's current price in early 2019. I think the COVID pandemic has massively increased SIGA\u2019s value and their key people are holding at a price where they previously sold knowing that a lot more cash is coming in. I think there's also some possibility of acquisition at higher share price, being debt free makes them attractive to a buyer--just pick up all the shares, no liabilities to clean up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Positions\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4kblzv7fghx41.png?width=1369&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca8701d26f11f88e7d0cbb3cb431607f4da2e30e\n\nI am long on the stock, I've built this position up over two months as I've become increasingly convinced that SIGA is a good move.\n\n**Options do not make sense on this play** because there\u2019s no volume and there are no LEAPs available. It will take time to write drug sales contracts and we\u2019re just not going to see the price increase enough in the next few months.\n\nI do have two (tiny pp) September $10 call contracts that I FOMO'd into and overpaid for when I saw the open interest jump from 50 to 600, thinking smart money was placing a wager. After completing this analysis, I disagree with that wager and will try to wait for a volatile day that I can sell the contracts for no loss. Additionally, I will sell monthly OTM covered calls at strikes that are inconsistent with the growth timeline of my thesis.\n\nHere\u2019s some other biotechs I have positions in, let me know if you would like a DD on any of these or if you have others that you think are complementary:\n\nARWR, consult u/Frostyfragzz \u2018s posts\n\nEBS, also in biodefense\n\nJNJ, the king\n\nDVAX, too small to write about but I\u2019m up 60% on shares\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Thank you for reading my novel.**\n\n**Disclaimer:** Just because I can write two coherent paragraphs on a play does not mean I know what I'm doing.
