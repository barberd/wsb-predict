(FEYE + $0.26 to $15.65):** Calls are outpacing puts roughly 7:1 as option traders primarily target the July 26th 15.50 call. Volume on this contract is 15,037 versus open interest of 539, so we know that this primarily represents new positioning. The bulk of the transactions on this contract consisted of various sized blocks that were being bought at the ask prices of $0.16 and $0.17, which suggests bullish intent. Note: FEYE is scheduled to report Q2 earnings on July 30th after the market close.\n\n**Micron Technology Inc. (MU + $0.77 to $47.72):** Calls are outpacing puts roughly 3:1 as the top seven most actively traded contracts are all calls. The most actively traded contract is the August 2nd 50.00 call (volume is 30,091 vs. open interest of 1,443) which mostly consisted of a 20,000 block that was bought at the ask price of $0.70. We know the block is a new position given the open interest figure and we can assume the intent is bullish in nature since the trade took place at the ask price.\n\n**Mylan N.V. (MYL + $0.45 to $18.80):** Calls are outpacing puts better than 5:1 which is mostly due to activity on the August 2nd 21.00 call. Volume on this contract is 7,447 (vs. open interest of 4,112), which mostly consisted of a 5,243 block that was bought for $0.60 when the bid/ask spread was $0.33 x $0.70 (suggesting bullish intent). Note: MYL is scheduled to report Q2 earnings on August 7th before the market open so the positioning on this contract does not include the potential impact of that event.", "created_utc": 1563996601, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/chcrmh/todays_options_market_72419/", "is_self": true}
