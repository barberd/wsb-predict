{"id": "g0p15r", "title": "Stock Thread", "selftext": "Hello retards,\n\nBelieve it or not, this subreddit used to be more than just SPY calls and puts and people defending their position of either red or black on roulette like they have any idea what the fuck their talking about. I wanted to share a few positions I'm either currently holding or looking to enter that are not very dependent on SPY's performance. Here they are:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKR - [https://imgur.com/a/B5fqLY0](https://imgur.com/a/B5fqLY0)\n\nAs stores are still open, I really like this play for a short term swing trade. Chart looks great and continuously uptrending, and my eyes are on RSI. If we see a bearish crossover, I'm out. Price Target: 33.50\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCLX - [https://imgur.com/a/3g0WV5O](https://imgur.com/a/3g0WV5O)\n\nSimilar play to KR, people are buying Clorox products like they're going out of business. Chart suggesting we have another huge day in the near future. Price Target: $190\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLAKE - [https://imgur.com/a/crpcMgv](https://imgur.com/a/crpcMgv)\n\nAnother COVID play, this one is purely based on TA. Added a few shares at 11.50 and just playing that level of support. Price Target: 17.25\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFeel free to post your non-market related plays, I'm tired of the red or black roulette wheel culture that this retard community has turned into. Let's make some money.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I like SNAP puts here too, Price Target $11.
