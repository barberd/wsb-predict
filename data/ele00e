Now hear me out retards before you start throwing your prebuilt HP Pavilion Gaming Desktops at me.  \n  \nYes we all know that AMD blows shintel out of the water in literally every way and the new stuff makes literally every Intel laptop look like a Chinese knockoff of the 1986 IBM PC Convertible. But look at the news and see who it really affects. Do you think $BECKY is going to buy a 64 core AMD Thundercock? Fuck no, $BECKY knows your eyes can only see 32 cores at a time. And you can be sure her favorite movie studios won't be either because we know in Frozen 3: Iced Caramel Macchiato, that new scene with Elsa doing coke off of Olaf's ass is going to be rendered with 4 year old workstations. Emperor Mickey Mouse is not going to fork out a fucking penny for that shit for several more years because he wants to max out those gains.  \n  \nNow let's get to the more important thing, laptops. Who are the primary audience for new laptop purchases? It's fucking $BECKY. We all know that you're not trading in your 3 year old AMD Ryzen Lenovo for another 10 years when you run out of Indian sweatshops capable of recovering your 1TB hentai collection because they cant find flex tape strong enough to hold your broken down cum stained piece of shit laptop together. Do you think $BECKY cares that AMD's new processors are 5 quadrillion times better than anything that ever made Bob Swan edge in his sleep? Hell fucking no. $BECKY needs her apps and all her friends hate when Shaun sends a green SMS from his lenovo anyway. She can't live without Pages and Keynote, and knows exactly how to turn on Microsoft remote desktop to get help when she can't find a tab she closed on Safari. And you know the fucking second she gets a dent in the cover or spills 1ml of her Matcha Green Tea on the keyboard of her 2019 MacBook Pro and it makes a little sticky noise, she's taking that bitch in to the Apple Store where they convince her to buy a brand new one in full. She will be in tears as she pulls out your Surge Mastercard and buys that 2020 Macbook Air along with the $420.69 Airpods pro deluxe that comes in a box with that cute emoji sticker.  \n  \nDon't say I didn't fucking warn you. $BECKY is coming, but you won't be.", "created_utc": 1578415480, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ele00e/the_first_best_time_to_buy_amd_was_2015/", "is_self": true}
