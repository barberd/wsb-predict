Im holding gold mining stocks and options on AUY until I'm comfortable. They've done well. However, like Alex Jones, I'm kinda retarded.\n\nCompared to previous QE, modern technology allows today's \ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\udda8's to print hard. Hard enough to crush \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 to a pulp.\n\nSince I'm retarded and dont know the answer, at what point has the \ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\udda8 printed enough \ud83d\udcb5 to overcome a drop in overall number value? If this is a retard question, make sure to include your perspective and berate OP.\n\nThank you all, retards and autists.", "created_utc": 1589004132.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gga0cy/at_what_point_is_it_priced_in/", "is_self": true}
