{"id": "ha7uuv", "title": "How slinging options work when interest rates go negative", "selftext": "What happens to options if interest rates go negative:\n\nIn the spirit of true full blown autist education, I am sure a lot of you are worried and wondering what happens to options if interest rates go negative since it is 1 of the 6 fundamental greeks used to price them. So here is a real quick summary of pricing:\n\n1. Black-Scholes is a pricing model used to determine the fair price or theoretical value for a call or a put option based on six variables such as volatility, type of option, underlying stock price, time, strike price, and **risk-free rate** ***(<- this means interest rates for the fellow savants that don't know)***\n2. Interest rate volatility forms part of the equation when calculating the price of options, a form of derivative that allows investors to buy assets at set prices in future **SO,** if interest rates are negative Black-Scholes breaks down and the fancy math formula fails since the cash or spot price of assets plunge below zero\n3. CME and ICE's are urging customers to use a model composed by **Louis Bachelier**, which works even if prices turn negative. (Adjust those models boys if you pricing shit on excel and you're fancy like that)\n\n**Tldr;** MEANING: if the big boys are preparing for the negative rates, the day it happens will probably cause a bunch of systems to glitch like it did for interactive brokers losing them $100M on oil futures when they went negative. If you can leverage unlimited on Robinhood during normal times I wonder what kind of bugs theyll miss when this shit hits the fan.\n\nHere are 3 different reading levels for my sources for fellow autists to educate themselves:\n\nBasic level learning k-12: [https://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/news/negative-us-rates-bloomberg-tells-its-users-to-prepare-2020-6-1029313707](https://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/news/negative-us-rates-bloomberg-tells-its-users-to-prepare-2020-6-1029313707)\n\nPretending to understand the article: [https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Financial-Services/gx-be-aers-fsi-pricing-with-negative-rates.pdf](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Financial-Services/gx-be-aers-fsi-pricing-with-negative-rates.pdf)\n\nFull blown savant *(why are you even in this group)*: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/0711.1272.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0711.1272.pdf)", "created_utc": 1592326625.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ha7uuv/how_slinging_options_work_when_interest_rates_go/", "is_self": true}
