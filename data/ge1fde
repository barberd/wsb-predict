BoA, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bank, and Chase. They ALL have lines out the door and around the block. Every day for the past 2 weeks, no matter what time I go. Wells Fargo in particular always has the longest line. I guess people still don't trust them after their scandal. \n\nI live in a pretty heavily immigrant neighborhood, and that might be a contributing factor as well.\n\nBut what else could be happening other than a bank run? Nobody is going in there to deposit anything, what is there to deposit? Nobody is going in there to sign up for a new card or open a new account. I bet we'll start to see local branches run out of money, and once one branch is out of money, the bank run will really take hold as everyone in line scramble to other branches and calls everyone they know.\n\nIn short, banks are fucked.
