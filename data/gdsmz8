The Economy is not the Market.**   \n\nHowever, Sales are the Economy, Revenue is the Economy, and Gross Profit is the Economy.   And the Economy is completely disconnected from the Market.  \n\nI have only observed this level of disconnect once before under .BOMB.  A separate era not applicable despite the similarities in false metrics to determine equity value.  In 1999 Userbase determined value instead of Revenues and in 2020 it's Future Returns at some unknown date standing in for Revenues.  .BOMB was limited to a sector, this is an era of financial delusion impacting any major publicly traded company.  \n\nThe Drumbeating response to the miracle recovery is that Treasury and Central Bank intervention has saved us from COVID... However, COVID by itself was simply exposing an economy where Stonks only go up and this has emboldened Federal intervention to no longer conceal themselves behind lobbyists and legislation.  That intervention has included drug commercials by the President and the removal of legal liability for meat processing plants.  Federal intervention and Oprah inspired bailouts are the new name of the game.\n\nAnd that game has little appeal to some investors,  Buffet is sitting on the sidelines saying there are no attractive buys while he sells assets deemed too risky at P/E's below 10.\n\nThe risk to us D.D. investors is that it's far too easy for the Fed to insert money directly into the market through the special relationships between Blackrock Capital and MSCI.   \n\n**If Blackrock is indeed buying calls on the US Treasury's behalf prior to purchasing the underlying ETF assets and then selling those calls, buying puts and then selling the underlying ETF they have created a nearly risk free arrangement to drive up and down Markets across the globe while making a profit.**   \\*\\*\\*Now I've said it, I've made my peace... think it through, shudder, cry, piss yourself... Whatever... just don't buy the major ETF's.\n\nThe likelihood of retesting SPY300 this week is extremely high.  I'd put it at 75%.  Of course the decoupling of revenues from stock prices makes D.D. on a SPY300 likelihood akin to betting on Boxing.  SPY293 5/8 if you must get a fix for your gambling habit.\n\n**How then do we as investors make money when D.D. on revenue, growth, and management decisions no longer significantly factor into stock price?**  \n\nLooking at languishing consumer demand, record unemployment, increased personal debt and lack of real wage increased along with uncertainty about Covid the market in any historical context should be a cratered world. (And maybe sanity will return with a market correction, but I personally fully doubt that given recent market fluctuations including today).   \n\nSteps I'm taking to make Money - \n\n1) **Buy Gold -** Long term this will backfire but the price of gold is rising as both inflation protection and as the only asset coupled to actual demand.  I'm personally in NEM with options no longer than 30 days at a time.  Selling when I get to 100% increase and then moving to the next 30 day window while taking my original investment off the table.   \\*Note Gold will backfire at some point this summer when people begin to sell it to protect their other significantly devalued assets.\n\n2) **Buy Cheap** \\- I refuse to look at any company trading higher than a P/E of 8 and a Debt to Equity of greater than 150%.  Ideally I'm looking at companies where their current Market Cap is 1/3rd of their Revenues.  CCL, PLAY, HAL I've made money on these dogs after the market crushed them, just remember to sell on the recovery.  Don't be greedy pigs.\n\n3) **Buy Essential -** The Company must be an essential service or support an essential service without an easy substitute.  Air travel for instance will be essential... and DAL is the only one I'm touching right now.\n\n4) **Buy on Bad News -** If you insist on being a short term investor moving back into cash after profits... then purchase after bad news on the market.  Telsa was an easy one... I waited a minute after the ELON Shock, bought shares... and then sold for a quick 5%.  \n\nThese are the rules I'm working under... I can't simply be unhappy that the market is irrational, I'd like to keep making record returns.  I will note that currently real estate is looking more and more attractive but that market won't be viable for deep discounts for another 6 months minimum and given historical precedent that's more likely to be 18 months away.  All my capital gains right now are being set aside to take advantage of that beating.\n\n**TLDR:  NEM June 5th $65C, DAL June 12th $25C  Sell both within the next week on gains above 20% and roll forward to your next opportunity.**  \n\nStay healthy, avoid Covid and avoid any major ETF", "created_utc": 1588660567.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gdsmz8/etfs_money_laundering_and_making_money_under_the/", "is_self": true}
