{"id": "es7rs2", "title": "T-Mobile and Sprint Merger", "selftext": " \n\nIn this infinite bull run when pretty much everything is going up 5% a day, it may be autistic to go all-in on Sprint. But with the judge decision allegedly coming next month, $S is priced in as if the deal is gonna fail, which is pretty gay.\n\nThe only big argument of the lawyers fighting against the merge is that it'll be less competition and higher prices for consumers.\n\nThere's no fucking \"Big 4\" being reduced to \"Big 3\" it's more like \"Big 2\" going up to \"Big 3\" so it'll be more competition and better for consumers.\n\nT-Mobile promised more jobs for Americans if the merger goes through and also not to raise plan rates for several years after fully introducing 5G which means way superior network (and faster RH fills) at same prices, this would restrict a little AT&amp;T and Verizon from hiking their prices too much with 5G (ATT is already charging more for 5G). If the merger is blocked ATT and Verizon rates will skyrocket and Sprint and Tmo will be irrelevant in the future, especially with John Legere leaving.\n\nPlus the merger will allow the \"New T-Mobile\" to add to T-Mo network the 2.5 GHz band and having lowband, midband and high band spectrum for 5G network and will allow many rural areas to have better communication.\n\nIsn't the USA supposed to be in a \"5G race\" with Gyna??? This merge is the only way we could have a chance.\n\nI think I'm going all-in with Sprint soon. The terms might be re-negotiated but at current terms, $S is at 40% discount of what you'll get if the merger goes through, being Pro T-Mobile might sound gay because all their pink stuff and shit but if the merger is blocked that's way GAYER AND ANTI-AMERICAN and it means ATT and Verizon are paying/bribing the lawyers fighting against the merger, we'll lose the 5G race and the judge victor marreno is a fag.", "created_utc": 1579672657, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/es7rs2/tmobile_and_sprint_merger/", "is_self": true}
