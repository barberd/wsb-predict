{"id": "haybpi", "title": "I, for one, welcome our chinese overlords", "selftext": "I pulled this DD directly out of my ass:\n\nEveryone here already knows GSX. It is an obvious blatant chinese scam stock. They use bots and fake their actual revenue. They are in debt and there is proof of that.\n\nHOWEVER, they 100% manipulate their stocks. I suspect they are pumping the price so they can exit scam somewhere in the future. Do not fucking short this shit until a trend reversal gets confirmed. Never bet against the house. It doesn\u2019t make any sense to buy a bunch of expensive OTM puts for next year either. Why would you lock your money away in this market full of opportunities?\n\nAlso, beijing is closing schools once again. This is an education online service, so this shit will most likely keep rallying all the way to $100.\n\nNever bet against winnie the pooh. God bless chyna!!!\n\nPositions: GSX jul 17 $70 Calls", "created_utc": 1592422214.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/haybpi/i_for_one_welcome_our_chinese_overlords/", "is_self": true}
