Bush, Patrick Stewart, Paul McCartney, Bob Dylan, Elton John, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Robert DeNiro, Steven Spielberg, Samuel Jackson and Iggy Pop.\n\nNow, we do have the best medical facilities in the world, especially compared to China, so the numbers may well turn out to be much lower. But consider for a moment that at least two people from the top and one person from bottom list will likely die within the next year due to Coronavirus.\n\nAnd it's a pretty small list. \n\nThis virus is changing and will continue to change our world and impact our lives, as well as the markets. As we are all making trades and losing money, I thought it important to highlight the human side of things. I think some due reflection at a time like this is important and healthy for us all.\n\nBest regards, LiquidityMan", "created_utc": 1583621570, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ff32yw/warren_buffet_morgan_freeman_and_queen_elizabeth/", "is_self": true}
