About 8 billion won ($6.7 million) of the four-month securities matured on Thursday. There was 127 billion won of such securities tied to German rates that were outstanding as of Aug. 7, according to the Financial Supervisory Service.\n\nA Woori Bank spokesperson contacted by Bloomberg referred to a Sept. 23 statement, saying the firm will actively seek ways to protect their customers in dispute reconciliation.\n\nThe FSS is investigating whether enough information was provided to investors when such products tied to overseas rates were sold, and whether they had design flaws. Individual investors seeking higher returns as interest rates fell in Korea were the predominant buyers of those securities: they made up 89.1% of the about 822 billion won of overseas rate-linked products outstanding as of Aug. 7, the financial regulator said last month.\n\nWhile the products have different terms, a typical one tied to German rates offer a return of 2% on six-month securities if the 10-year yield is minus 0.25% or higher, but if it falls below that level, investors lose 2.5% of their principal every time the yield drops one basis point, according to the FSS.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-26/korean-investors-lose-98-1-in-german-rate-bets-gone-very-wrong?srnd=premium-asia", "created_utc": 1569489139, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d9h3ot/korean_masterminds_lost_98_of_loaned_money_on/", "is_self": true}
