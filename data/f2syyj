Technically I'm an SDR, so I'm not making the sale, but I'm setting meetings for Account Executives. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey're sending me out to an event this Spring and had me request a corporate AMEX card. It just arrived, let's goooo. My question is, how can I transfer money from my corp card to RH, and about how much is reasonable? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course, I need to make it look like it's legit.
