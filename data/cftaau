Sometimes you just have to go back to fundamentals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"DD\" is Dunkin Donuts.  Any trader worth their salt starts the day of with a bump and a lahge iced coffee from dunks.  It's important to start the day of right to maximize gainz and any post with DD is a reminder that you gotta get your uppers in to rev that engine up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"FD\" is Free Dunks.  Due to their high probability of profit, way OTM weekly options, either uppies or downies (those are advanced terms beyond the scope of this post), are basically free money which l33t traders can then use to fuel further gainz by buying more iced coffee and blow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Tendies\" is an abbreviated version of \"ten of deez nutz\" which is used to describe a ten-bagger FD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Credit spread\" is... da fuck do I know about options?  That's some advanced shit right there who do you think I am, Michael Burry?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Box spread\" is a legendary options position that literally can't go tits up, but it's like those legendary birds in pokemon, you've got to know how to find them and then there's only like two of them.  If your ultra ball doesn't work and you already blew your masterball on Mewtwo, then you're shit outta luck, guy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, thought this sub could use a refresher on the basics.", "created_utc": 1563670781, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cftaau/basic_terminology_explanations/", "is_self": true}
