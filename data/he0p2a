They also intend to sell $1.5 billion of debt, issue $750 million in stock and $750 million in convertible debt and enter into a $500 million loan facility.\n\nFor some reason, it looks like someone/institutions purchased 24,594 6/26 17C today. I am pretty sure it is an opening position. If you see the 25k in OI tomorrow that tells me someone knows some good news is coming. I'm buying these tomorrow if that happens.\n\nedit: It is fucking tanking after hours lol.
