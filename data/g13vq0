{"id": "g13vq0", "title": "Buy Calls on Echostar ($SATS) - Buying now is the equivalent of going back in time 2 months ago and buying calls on Netflix / Zoom", "selftext": "I'll keep this reasonably short because y'all don't like walls of text even if the text is amazing DD.\n\nEchostar (SATS) owns HughesNet which provides satellite internet to residential customers in the US and Latin America. Together with their main competitor, Viasat, they control 100% of the US residential satellite internet market (duopolies are usually a good thing).\n\n**I believe SATS is likely going to benefit from the covid-19 lock-downs as people consume more internet by staying at home watching Netflix, playing video games and scrolling Instagram/ Reddit. The monthly plans have data caps so if you want more internet you have to increase your plan.**\n\nContrary to what you urban city-folk might think, many Americans (20 million households) live in areas where the only wire-line internet option is DSL. Those customers who want faster internet are willing to pay $60-80 for satellite internet via Echostar or Viasat to get download speeds of 20 mbps which is shockingly better than the main DSL offerings in the areas (DSL is $40-80 per month).\n\nSATS has grown broadband subscribers and revenue at a >10% growth rate over the last 6 years and profit has grown faster so it's a growing industry. SATS and Viasat combined only serve 2 million households out of a 20 million household addressable market so there's plenty of room for growth.\n\n**Why SATS over VSAT? Well, for starters, SATS is currently valued at just 5x EBITDA vs satellite peers at 7-8x and VSAT at >10x despite better growth. Second, SATS has $25 in cash per share compared to a stock price of $31 so there is zero bankruptcy or solvency risk. VSAT on the other hand has high leverage.**\n\n**The stock was $45 two months ago (compared to $31 today) and I think it will be at least $40 in 3-6 months once people realize this pandemic is actually positive for Echostar's business.**", "created_utc": 1586863915.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g13vq0/buy_calls_on_echostar_sats_buying_now_is_the/", "is_self": true}
