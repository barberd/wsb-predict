You morons cured my depression(at least some symptoms) and increased my networth by 30%. \n\nI hailed the call of the mother ship early march after reading the bloomberg article. My RH account was approved on 3rd april(SPY @ 248) and I bought 240p 5/1. That was also the day SPY started skyrocketing and I kept catching the falling knife. I became even more depressed as I was down about 2.5k which for me was money with which I could have paid 200$ extra pm and not lived in a basement(not kidding, I actually live in a basement). I eventually let go of it and closed it at 2k loss and learnt a bunch of things to not do. \n\nAfter a day SHOP tanked and I rode the 510p while going down and 800c while going up next morning. This almost recouped my lossed and I decided to never again put more than 10% of my portfolio(7k) into options. Since then I have mostly traded spreads. \n\nOne strategy that works for me although it must be used by lot of other people is I look at the 1 months, 1 week, 1 year performance of companies in the same sector and it shows a divergence for one stock in a weekly/monthly chart and there are no fundamental reasons for it I buy a 1-2 month OTM call. I did this for twtr and FB last week and broke my rules on catching the knife, but  I had conviction. Over the week I had accumulated 250 contacts 35c 7/17 at avg price of 0.16$ and just one FB 230c 9/5 9.60$. Sold this morning @.21 per contract at market open and fb at 17.  \n\nI know this is peanuts for a lot of you but even after taxes this is a lot of money for me. Slowly transitioning into thetagang but I am stil too poor for that. \n\nThank you all for the laughs each night. I am gonna go to chick-fil-a now. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jviiolwxia851.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=352b874588e6475891f7d1e3b623efc684bc1480\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gq80kwcxia851.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f150768459e8779f08f95c87a1e7d1a0708a2d4\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zgq4kerwia851.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=001c5d85d50818ebefee2f74154c8c4468d216bd", "created_utc": 1593630029.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hjgmjk/measly_by_this_subs_standards_but_i_feel_happy/", "is_self": true}
