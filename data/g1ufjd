{"id": "g1ufjd", "title": "Puts on Home Depot/Lowes - Housing Crisis Pressures", "selftext": "As we move into a recession, unemployment hits record highs, quarantine limits B&M purchasing, forbearance rates propel past 2000%+, and tenants miss payments during eviction holds, there is one sector that is highly vulnerable.\n\n**Home Improvement stores.**\n\nHome Depot's online sales represent just [7.9% of its total sales](https://www.forbes.com/sites/andriacheng/2019/02/26/four-key-takeaways-from-home-depots-q4-earnings/), a small drop in the bucket compared to their largest competitor: Amazon.\n\nAs Home Builder confidence [plummets to lowest levels since 201](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/home-builder-confidence-plummets-to-lowest-level-since-2012-as-coronavirus-disrupts-construction-activity-2020-04-15)2, Home Depot is at risk because Pro customers (contractors and business accounts) make [up >45% of total sales.](https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/08/24/home-depot-is-leaving-it-to-the-pros.aspx) That represents increased exposure to their bottom line.\n\nHome Depot has increased perks for their employees, including offering up to 60 days of paid sick time and extra [hazard pay of $100 per week](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/03/19/home-depot-adjusts-hours-extends-paid-time-off-due.aspx). On the surface this is a nice PR stunt, but exacerbates their profit margin headwinds. Meanwhile a Home Depot [employee has died from Corona Virus.](https://wfxl.com/news/local/the-home-depot-in-albany-takes-safety-measures-after-employee-dies-from-covid-19) As shoppers flock to Home Depot and commingle closely due to their limited capacity, this represents increase unforeseen operating risk for Home Depot. Home Depot has already quietly closed [ALL of their Ottawa](https://www.blogto.com/city/2020/04/home-depot-and-all-hardware-stores-ontario-are-now-closed/) locations, despite being listed as an essential company. Additional closures remain to be seen.\n\nReduced operating hours Home Depot closes at 6PM provides customers who work a very small window to shop, with the majority of Americans work day ending at 5pm. While it is true that Home renovations are up during the first wave of Quarantines, as unemployment rises, salaries are cut (many are seeing -20% across the board), children remain home from school and require daycare or babysitters, discretionary spending on a kitchen or bathroom upgrade will likely be forgone.\n\nHome Depot has donated all of their N95 masks. Another great PR move, but PPE is an important Covid-19 sales item right now that acted as a loss leader to bring customers into the store. Not stocking these masks represents increased friction to customers who believe that [retail is a zero sum game](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/competition-in-retail-has-become-a-zerosum-game-111841203.html).\n\n**Financials**\n\nHome Depot has a poor value based on it's PE ratio of 19.3x compared to Special Retail industry average of 9.3x. Home Depot also operates at a 19.3x PE ratio compared to the US market (13.9x). Furthermore, it's PEG ratio is 5.4x (poor) and also has negative assets (more liabilities than assets). It's future growth is expected to be just 3.6% while it is only 16.5% undervalued compared to 2020 highs with a fair value of $247.26. As manufacturing and supply chain issues ramp, Home Depots inventory that is China made represents an additional hurdle for their logistics chain. Tool rentals, Pro Services, and HVAC sales, the other components of Home Depots revenue will be impacted by declining [Home Builder confidence](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3560892-home-depot-and-lowes-seen-risk-of-housing-slump). If we see a further decrease in new home purchases, exacerbated by increased [hurdles for new home mortgages by banks](https://www.foxbusiness.com/money/jpmorgan-chase-mortgage-borrowing-standards-as-coronavirus-economic-outlook), these components of Home Depots bottom line will be further impacted.\n\nHome Depots revenue is expected to grow slower than the US market (2.8% per year vs. 6.9% per year). Home Depots earnings are expected to grow slower than the US Market (3.6% vs 11.4%).\n\nMost concerning is Home Depots debt to equity history. Home Depot has $30.318 BILLION of debt, with -$3.116 Billion of equity and a -973% Debt to equity Ratio. Home Depot relies on their annual profit margin to account for their liabilities. As profit slips due to CV concerns with retail sales [slumping 8.7% in March](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/15/business/retail-sales/index.html), Home Depots debt to equity gap continues to increase. Did consumers pick up their B&M shopping at Home Depot in lieu of other stores? Earnings is released May 18 and Home Depot declined to extend their [earnings date](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/will-companies-in-the-dow-report-earnings-as-usual-despite-covid-19-disruptions-or-delay-them-because-they-can-2020-03-31).\n\n[Red Flag](https://preview.redd.it/nggiyxid50t41.png?width=1392&format=png&auto=webp&s=20f59f9d1442e3fcdcf04e8f32a8602de6004d85)\n\nIt's no surprise that they quietly reinforced their [balance sheet](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/04/10/how-home-depot-made-sure-it-will-get-through-the-c.aspx).\n\nOn March 26, the company agreed to borrow $5 billion in four batches, which it can use for general corporate purposes. Let's look at each one in a little more detail:\u00a0\n\n* \u00a0$750 million due seven years from now in April 2027, carrying an interest rate of 2.5%, sold at 99.1% of par.\u00a0\n* \u00a0$1.5 billion due ten years from now in April 2030, carrying an interest rate of 2.7%, sold at 98.99% of par. \u00a0\n* \u00a0$1.25 billion due in 20 years in April 2040, carrying an interest rate of 3.3%, sold at 98.36% of par.\u00a0\n* \u00a0$1.5 billion due in 30 years in April of 2050, carrying an interest rate of 3.35%, sold at 97.98% of par.\u00a0\n\nThis has yet to be priced into the stock as it mirrors SPY's daily runs.\n\n**Insider Trading**\n\nInsiders at Home Depot know these headwinds are not to be taken lightly as well, with insiders selling more shares than they have bought in the past 3 months.\n\n[Ut Oh](https://preview.redd.it/uyfr3qrg50t41.png?width=1292&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff0e2442fadce7e563b5dee52ae0b86ce5e90d10)\n\nWhat do you think?
