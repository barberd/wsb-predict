One of the most under reported stories ever is when i had to stop ordering avocados for a week because prices went from 26/cs to 125/cs for hard as rock 2 week out shit avocados. SoCal and northern Mexico have the best climate for avocados and they got themselves in an ole fashion price war, hijacking trucks, ruining loads, all of the sort. Same shit that happens all the time between northern Italy and southern France,(all alcohol is good, proud bastards). that fixed itself in about two weeks. berries(Black, straw, blue, razz) on the DAILY fluctuate insanely. most hover around 18-26 a flat. However, there have been weeks where Over the years where black berries rocket to no joke, 80/flat for two days, then razz will rocket to 60 for a week, blue berries will hit 50max, and then strawberries will hover 40 for parts of the year, but some days significantly lower.Think of fucking ZM, big swings on the daily, ya never know and it never makes a lick of sense the romaine always gets recalled( yeah thats news to no one) but the quality in all of these supplies stays the same or improves, meat just keeps going down/flat in quality while prices rocket. for all of these products they are packaged and shipped to suppliers right from same place.\n\nOk i'm fucking REEEEEing about this, somewhat necessary for context.\n\nSo we all obviously know the meat market and supply chain is SHITTING the bed, take a look at meat futures.\n\nnow, there are various reasons to that, the most predominate being the fact that the meat markets demand has been from speed and quality, and the very very delicate nature of the meat market.\n\nnow the first thing i started to look into years ago is why is everyone fucking REEing saying there wont be cows or meat by 2040? cows are easy as fuck to raise, feed, and slaughter, the fuk they saying??\n\nwell, glutinous america, the fact that fast food ripped so fast, it caused small farms to shit the bed and ramp up speed running cows  through the slaughterhouse, not realizing they were wasting so many other parts of the cow, because of the NEED FOR SPEED! this caused years of over production and stupidity thinking nOtHiNg CaN eVeR gO wRoNg fAsT fOoD dA sHiT.\n\nok OP so the fuck what its shitting throw those cows in freezers or some shit,\n\nTHERE IS YER SIGN\n\nthese processing factories just bleed out and de-organ the cows essentially, send that fucker to some asshole with a ban-saw to cut it!!!\n\nfuck all those cows that arent PRISTINE PERFECT quality, murder them feed em to the pigs, keep pumping more\n\nthen it goes to packaging plants for them to break and distribute! they say woohoo send it on refrigerated trucks to suppliers to distribute!\n\nsuppliers then have to say, eh fuck this cut, i can make more by repackaging it and selling to these fuckheads at a prime markup!  fuk em meat=more money\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSlaughterhouse: o whats the deal, thats a solid fucking line of shit, what could go wrong, fuck a pandemic, thats nothing, we see supply chain disruptions all the fucking time, pussy ass pandemic. everyones home, noone cooks for themselves(not enough money in that), they'll order out\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSlaguhterhouse: fuck, demand, why isnt that up? 80% of restaurants shutdown and fastfood sales have fallen off, fuck oh shit well, cant sell these cows right now, they cost money to feed, and i have **nowhere to store them because i only cut these fucking things.who needs a fucking freezer(cash reserve)?? ill send extra to processor**\n\nProcessing plant- fuck that bro, no big supplier to restaurants wants shit right now demand is shot and **i dont store this shit so fuck that no more cows. lets see if suppliers will take it at discount!!**\n\nsuppliers- discounted meats? hmm, idk no one is buying or paying all of their back bills, so i cant even pay you the full payment for last order\n\nplant- FUCK, what about restaurants directly!!\n\nRestaurants**-** ive been closed for 2 months and im probably done even if i open because of the mound of debt i already sit on\n\nprocessing plant- FUCK, ok well, cant sell this premium product, not worth losing on price to the normal shitty human consumer. fuck that, restaurants will back no need to change my approach or **GET A FUCKING FREEZER, lol a freezer it wouldnt be PRISTINE.**\n\n**tRdr( too ree dont read)-** the meat market is the most broken supply chain in the entire world and the only one really destined to fail in the food supply network due to length of production to sale. over glutinous want has created a monster of over demand that doesn't know how to store excess to selll at a later date for actual money. Short meat futures and big processing companies, even if they are down, theyll feel the pain for a while. this is also going to cause ALOT of stir in people when they cant get meat from stores or are heavily limited. this will be part of the trigger of social unrest( look at these fuckers REEEing that cant get a haircut)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntldr- stock the fuck up\n\n&#x200B;\n\nmy Pos- spy 260 6/19 loaded to the tits on Tuesday of this week, nothing else, RIP Rocketman\n\neasy play- short tyson, companies a wreck as it is", "created_utc": 1588260352.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gaxqdy/the_meat_industry_an_absolute_utter_disgrace/", "is_self": true}
