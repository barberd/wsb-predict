{"id": "fn1r74", "title": "Gilead Sciences ($GILD) and Novel Coronavirus DD", "selftext": "Gilead currently has a very wide patent publication (US20170071964A1) that covers \"*methods for treating Arenaviridae and Coronaviridae virus infections by administering nucleosides and prodrugs thereof:*\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[This is the structural backbone of the patented drug.  Basically, where every R\u02e3 position is noted, it denotes a radical and analog to the backbone.  They covered every analog and derivative of this molecule in the patent, and to great length.](https://preview.redd.it/th7rhb7vr8o41.png?width=562&format=png&auto=webp&s=8398e5ea8e0c36e6ac2b803c06692a90734b6b1d)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is important because it essentially blocks the use of \"designer drug\" use by other pharmaceutical companies; many drugs that are patented are altered slightly to skirt IP law and patent protection.  Gilead went to extremes and patented every workable extension of this molecule, effectively preventing capitalization from other companies.  Now, **this patent expiration is held until January 8th, 2037, and it was filed September 16, 2016.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Efficacy of Compound 1 and Compound 32 -- in vitro trials. EC50 denotes a concentration of a drug that gives half the maximum response.  In this case, we can see that Compound 32 \\(Remdesivir\\) is much more potent; the EC values are much lower in both Middle-Eastern \\(MERS\\) and Southeast Asian \\(SARS\\) Coronavirus \\(CoV\\).](https://preview.redd.it/52m1ts7nu8o41.png?width=495&format=png&auto=webp&s=3786c0d51f66afc3a1c92550f053cd505e6a9936)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[This is an analog of Compound 1, shown above.  Both compounds are protected in this patent.  Today, this drug is called Remdesivir.](https://preview.redd.it/9vzrr0kav8o41.png?width=538&format=png&auto=webp&s=0664c189541fe18263b7c6b16c48ab8c8d3093d6)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis does not mean that these compounds will be effective in vivo, as there are many other factors at play when using a full biological system rather than isolated cells (in vitro study).  This simply means there is hope for a novel treatment, and has been for years now.  We know now that they are on the fast-track for approval of Remdesivir for the treatment of CoVID-19.  But what isn't talked about is the over 100 other analogs that are also patent-protected by Gilead. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis means, essentially, that Gilead will be the sole proprietor of CoVID-19 treatment if Remdesivir happens to be effective in vivo. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n$GILD reached a peak of about $119 in 2015, and it is currently floating at $79.  This process will take a short while to bump the stock, but I personally go long on 8/21 $110 calls, as that gives us about 5 months before profitability is shown. \n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr $GILD 8/21 $110c", "created_utc": 1584892306.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fn1r74/gilead_sciences_gild_and_novel_coronavirus_dd/", "is_self": true}
