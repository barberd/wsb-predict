I\u2019m just speaking out of m\u2019pleasure hole so put on your goddam tin foil hats and listen up. I believe the big bois and not the feds(they definitely are but not as intense as what we believe it to be) are the ones manipulating the market. \n\n2.Before the first trip to the center of the Earth our glorious elected officials basically said fuck it and sold their shares prepping for the inevitable. They got a ton of shit because they timed it perfectly. We dropped harder than a fat ass squatting for the first time because everyone knows a firm ass is better than a flat ass. \n\n3.Now look at the news again, the senator that got caught red handed , Georgia Senator Kelly Loeffler, said she and her CEO husband is liquidating their entire personal portfolios by the end of the week which is basically tomorrow. Now kids look at the key word which is \u201c CEO Husband\u201d. The husband isn\u2019t any normal Hillbilly CEO, he\u2019s the chairman of the NYSE. Yes that\u2019s it bois we got him. There\u2019s no way he would allow her to sell for a loss and once they liquidate everything the stock markets going to crater. What if he were the one that pumped the market up till this point? I might just be talking out of my ass but who knows. \n\n\nTLDR:  when were you when market dies? \n\ni was gerrymandering Georgia when phone ring\n\n\u201cmarket is kil\u201d\n\n\u201cyes\u201d\n\n\nEdit: They timed this shit perfectly they can either use the oil as an excuse to pump it up and the huge dildo known as unemployment to drill. In n out bois. \n\nPositions: SPY 4/17 245 , 5/4 185, 5/15 265.", "created_utc": 1586408824.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxmb20/put_on_your_tin_foil_hats/", "is_self": true}
