{"id": "h9mstt", "title": "MFA Financial Shock Table DD", "selftext": "Been doing some research recently into MFA Financial (MFA). Saw this and thought it could be valuable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's not forget the management team we're dealing with.  Craig Knutson and Ron Freydberg have created a strong non-agency portfolio with good protection on the downside. The interest rate shock table from the 2019 10K shows an INCREASE in income with lower rates. The only REIT in the industry with that luxury. Knutson built a lot of downside protection. $142M in extra income with just a 1% IR drop. The >2% drop almost guarantees profitability. Average quarter interest expense is only $70M. This could be a big surprise.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"The impact on our net interest income is driven mainly by the difference between portfolio yield and cost of funding of our repurchase agreements, which includes the cost and/or benefit from Swaps. Our asset/liability structure is generally such that an increase in interest rates would be expected to result in a decrease in net interest income, as our borrowings are generally shorter in term than our interest-earning assets.\"\n\n[2019 IR Shock Table \\(in 000s\\)](https://preview.redd.it/rgsolpxsi4551.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae161a1f52717a8808e485b8709f7d5c724c6baa)", "created_utc": 1592248541.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h9mstt/mfa_financial_shock_table_dd/", "is_self": true}
