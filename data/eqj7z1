But 2% is a short term anomaly. Historically, the Fed had to cut 5% to get us of a recession. 5% fed fund rate is a healthy economy and full normalization.\n\nTherefore, using a 5% fed fund rate for DCF, stocks are very overvalued.\n\nBUYING at these prices is mainly chasing the repo liquidity, which is fine, but the long term, it seems like a dangerous play.\n\nTHE other corollary is that we'll be at 2% or lower for longer implying stock prices are elevated and not in a bubble. BUT if you hold that view you must also accept we are in a liquidity trap. IMPLYING that if the Fed ever reduces the balance sheet the financial markets will collapse.\n\ntldr;  \n\nBuy CALLS while repo liquidity and balance sheet is expanding.\n\nBuy PUTS when repo liquidity ends and balance sheet is neutral in the beginning.\n\nDistortion in the market are too great to be Theta Gang at this Late Cycle, cusp of being End Cycle", "created_utc": 1579368010, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eqj7z1/market_are_overvalued_using_dcf_analysis_with_a/", "is_self": true}
