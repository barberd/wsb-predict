{"id": "gmd7l5", "title": "$LOW call holders", "selftext": "the sentiment has been that \"sell before earnings\" on here. Thats all well and good inverse wsb and such BUT. On friday Ole Jimmy Cramer made the statement to sell before earnings in a slip in style comment towards the end of the show.\n\n\ud83e\udd14\n\nThe CEO is a fucking cuck, but owns shitloads of stock and sells alot for profit and then reinvests it, so it feels like that people are going in assuming that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI dont see how this company doesn't absolutely SLAUGHTER earnings, neighbor is a store lead and their busiest week is normally  July 4th, she said its been busier than that, and they are cranking 1.5 milli a week. i can def confirm busy as fuck.\n\nIn a downturn, houses get vacated and people have to fix shit and flip houses, and so on. They have that to stand on as well\n\nIV is on crack levels and the crush could hurt. this is whats holding my peepee at 1/2cm erect levels right now.\n\nInversing Cramer normally lines up opposite of WSB sentiment, i bought a FUCK load of 5/22 120cs for 1.18 and already sold enough to break even.\n\nit feels like im in a inverse inside an inverse, within an inverse, but Cramer cant save me.\n\nconvince me to return the $ROPE i bought in case i failed before, and NOT hold these fucking things till  after earnings\n\noh and if i hold and make a killing, ill drink a dog shit smoothie with some cat piss as a garnish and fuckin CHUG it.\n\nStrike- $SPY  100/600 bull-credit-spread-of-bear-cheeks\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR, Hold through earnings ( aint no risk it ,aint no biskit) or sell and keep the cash gang rolling?", "created_utc": 1589845548.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gmd7l5/low_call_holders/", "is_self": true}
