This is what happened this week. \n\nThe IMF revised their global GDP growth forecast this week estimating a -5% contraction which is worse than what was originally expected. Previously in April they had forecasted that GDP growth would contract only -3% in 2020. All indices saw massive selling pressure after the announcement wiping out previous gains to end the week in the red. The S&P ended the week down nearly 3%, the Nasdaq declined 2.5% closing below 10,000 points, and the dow had a steep decline of 4.4%. They cited concerns over an output loss of over $12 trillion to the global economy, as well as debt levels reaching their highest ever in relation to GDP.\n\nDonald Trump signaled that further stimulus is being discussed for the month of July although no official plan has been proposed by congress yet. Steve Mnuchin seemed to suggest that another stimulus would be \u201cmuch more targeted towards jobs\u201d. This seemed to imply that rather than a second round of stimulus checks there would be incentives for getting back to work and creating jobs. This would probably be welcomed considering the extra $600 in unemployment benefits individuals have been receiving is set to end at the end of July. Although there is concern that the sudden drop in benefits will end up greatly affecting individuals who are relying on unemployment to stay afloat during the Covid crisis. Arizona current pays the lowest amount of unemployment at a max of $245 per week, and is also starting to be considered the new epicenter of Corona Virus in the US and is now seeing between 2500-3000 new cases per day.\n\nTech got their ass beat this week as $AAPL announced they would be closing down stores in states that have seen increases in Covid 19 cases. Earlier in the week they had reached a new ATH of $371 as some speculated they may have their best quarter ever, but ended the week almost $20 lower at $353.\n\nFacebook received a beating dropping 6.5% after Verizon pulled their ads from facebook after complaints that their ads were showing up next to anti-semetic ads. This sparked a boycott of $FB with many companies suspending their ads such as REI, North Face, Levi Strauss, Honda, Hersheys, Eddie Bauer, Coca Cola, & Ben and Jerries. This caused Zuckerberg to take reverse his previous stance of non regulation of ads on his website, and is now beginning a new process of reviewing content to filter out hateful and deceitful advertising.\n\nDespite Steven Mnuchin claiming \u201cThe US can\u2019t shut down again\u201d although states have already rolled back reopening measures. So far the states that have slowed or abandoned reopening due to raise in Covid-19 cases are California, Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Idaho, New York, North Carolina, Florida, Kansas, Maine, Nevada, and Oregon. On Friday 06/26 Corona Virus cases surged more than 40% compared to the previous week, with 45K new cases reported across the US on Friday alone with the younger population between 20-40 accounting for a majority of those caes. This is believed to be in large part to young people being out in the general public from states reopening.\n\nTrump secured another deregulation victory this week loosening up reactions on banks that were placed on them after the 2008 financial crisis. The deregulation will free up capital for banks to make riskier investments that ultimately led to the great recession. Banks will now be able to make easier trades in venture capital, and removes requirements for setting aside capital when derivative trading. This will free up billions of dollars for banks to make investments such as swaps, and I for one can\u2019t wait to be able to buy a house for pennies on the dollar again. This initially caused a financial sector rally on Thursday while the rest of the market was tanking until the Fed released the results of their stress test. The stress test of 33 banks showed that many would remain solvent during hard economic conditions, but some could fall dangerously low on their reserves. As a result the Fed capped bank dividend payments and share buy backs for the third quarter.", "created_utc": 1593285614.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hgzmvz/this_weeks_news_events_0622_0626/", "is_self": true}
