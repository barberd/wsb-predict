This, on top of its rapidly growing developer platform, is consequential for many reasons as a market-mover in the industry.\n\nIn Short\n\nCloudFlare so far has been shredding forward across multiple technical markets competing against by:\n\n* Competing marketshare against CISCO, Palo Alto Networks, and other hardware customers\n* Offering a way to not lock your organization into a big tech vendor\n* Promoting security and challenging Big Tech's direction with web development\n* Forming positive relationships with Shopify, Facebook, JD, Twitter, Baidu, TOR, and Microsoft\n* Pioneering the ease-of-use privacy movement with 1.1.1.1 and distributing VPNs.\n* Growing a rapid, robust, cost-effective, and secure network across the world\n* *Providing a development platform that promotes the use extremely powerful and 'cutting edge' web computing.* **-> YOU ARE HERE**\n* Creating a better internet.\n\n***Cofounder of NPM - a primary pioneer in the cloud market*** image\n\nThe Thesis\n\nThe economic value and convergence between e-commerce, global networking speeds, and video advancements is not anywhere close to realized. There has been an acceleration toward this reality but it's still early in the overall economic development cycle. This timeframe has been accelerated greatly due to global market lockdowns and further risk of lockdown.\n\nPhysical and monetary assets being virtualized has recently been accelerated in importance and this will have positive effects, across time, on businesses that focus on securing those assets in its time spent delivering on multiple ultra-high-speed networks across the world. Computing is getting cheaper and easier to distribute in rather extreme ways and the execution of these ideas is happening right now.\n\nimage\n\nInfrastructure that support these interactive ecosystems will be growing at incredible rates. This market is **BIG** and no one or two players will be large enough to capture the market. It ranges from manufacturers, energy departments, web products, hospitals, governments, and so on. Security is serviced differently based on the industry. This much is obvious - a hospital will clearly protect patient records more closely than a manufacturer controlling the runtime of their high-speed machining assembly line.\n\n***ZScaler servicing manufacturing, IT, and industrial operations*** image\n\n***CloudFlare prioritizing hospital security over web retailers*** image\n\n***Amazon && Facebook angling for web retailers over hospitals*** image\n\n***Fastly executes on video and media delivery*** image\n\nThe need for secure video, transactions, VR, and user experiences will be dramatically shot up and this is evident across many exciting technologies like Apple VR, Google Gaming, Square Banking, Facebook Shops with VR shopping, Microsoft software automations, and government developments.\n\nNET is one of the best positioned companies to pioneer this market at scale.\n\nMarket drivers & a brief history of modern computing\n\nimage\n\nThe history of CDNs took a much larger turn when YouTube and Netflix became big players in data production and needed to cooperate with Internet Service Providers to manage the new dam and tunnels of water that the market had created.\n\nAs many of you know, video data is large and streaming high quality videos at high speed to millions of users in real time was no laughing matter. Around this time you also began to see new products in ESports like Twitch.tv which would \"stream\" video.\n\nWhat had happened was that tech companies discovered a more cost effective way of delivering video and it was through controlling the actual pipeline. You would receive atomized content as needed rather than waiting for blocks of video to be received on your end (this was problematic in early Youtube days with broadband and DSL)\n\nThe paradigm began to shift. Cloud computing and asynchronous models began to gain steam in the developer profession. We began a defining chapter of web optimizations that still continue today with serverless computing, real-time data, and growing user-experiences. At this time you began to notice that you no longer had to refresh your web page to receive new data. Remember when Facebook started to notify you rather than you checking your notifications? Do you remember when you had to check your email?\n\nimage\n\nToday, developers are able to create or distribute product and services using networking and data center functions. This is largely what is recognized as cloud and serverless computing. This is has many consequences but primarily allows for unbelievably fast responses and avenues for user experiences.\n\nimage\n\nWhat is serverless computing?\n\nServerless computing allows a 25 year old developer like me run 5 different businesses on my dinky little Macintosh while I let Google and Cloudflare run my servers under an extremely cheap pricing model. That is a revolutionary change for software. It is one of the bread and butter of SaaS, IaaS, and other cloud style businesses where many business problems come out of the box for you.\n\nimage\n\nOther competitive advantages of network and cloud computing\n\nThe reason Snapchat did not gain any traction outside of the US was because Facebook provided a fundamentally faster service across WhatsApp and Instagram. Facebook's investment in Akamai and its personal networking infrastructure allowed them to create a product that was fast, cheap and would work in various rural or economic conditions. Snapchat never stood a chance in the global social media landscape as a result.\n\nimage\n\nWhat's special about CloudFlare as a network?\n\nWhat CloudFlare specifically offers against its competitors is its **privacy-first approach** and its quality of engineering. CloudFlare is essentially a distributed private content delivery network (pCDN) with a massive infrastructure effort to send data around the world safely and cheaply.\n\nThis is fundamentally consequential as we are seeing massive nations tackle issues with how data can be utilized or privatized.\n\nPrivacy and speed sells. A Cloudflare sells it at the best price. image\n\n***Facebook: \"The future is private\"*** image\n\n***Cloudflare grows with the internet's need for security.*** image image\n\nWhere Does CloudFlare currently stand in the market?\n\n***How they see themselves*** image\n\n***Against the ecosystem*** image\n\n***In 2020, all needs have increased.*** image\n\n***Drastically more edge locations than Big Tech globally in contested regions like Africa, China, and other economic frontiers.*** image image\n\nDeep market relationships\n\nCloudFlare has had large scale investments, partnerships, and business ventures with organizations like:\n\n***JD Cloud and Chinese infrastructure, which will inevitably boom with revenue from video scaling, contentious privacy, e-commerce and infrastructure*** image\n\n***Supporting recent legends like Shopify*** image\n\n***Growing with global industry leaders*** image\n\n***A competitive proxy that approaches Big Tech's biggest legal problems*** image\n\nSo what does this mean for CloudFlare?The missing puzzle piece: CloudFlare TV and Cloudflare StreamingTarget: Enterprise, profits, generosity, and long-term market capture.\n\nA big piece that's missing from Cloudflare's economic puzzle is the release and support of distributed video and video development.\n\n***Piece 1: Easy to use, distributed, private, secure networking*** image\n\n***Piece 2: Easy to use, distributed, secure, cost-effective streaming*** image\n\n***Piece 3: Easy to use, distributed, secure, cost-effective enterprise IT*** image\n\n***Piece 4: Easy to use, distributed, secure, cost-effective software development*** image\n\n***Piece 5: The missing piece.

I'm a software engineer that's passionate about education and have really enjoyed exercising my knowledge-base during this investment time. Usually i get really excited about a stock or two at best per year based on certain global developments. These stocks are selected based on powerful and consequential market relationships or competitions occurring in the arena and by simply just participating in the market as much as I can myself.\n\nI have made a fair amount of money with\n\n* \\[REDACTED\\]COIN & AMD's computing relationship (Bought \\[REDACTED\\]COIN at 2k, AMD at $11)\n* E-Commerce and Facebook's growing relationship with small businesses (my first options reached 20x on FB)\n\ncurrently investing heavily in:\n\n* Privacy \\[**CloudFlare, Big Tech, US, China, and global development**\\]\n* Automation, manufacturing, and battery improvements \\[**Panasonic, FANUC, Texas, Mexico and Japan**\\]\n* Mexican-American trade \\[**Kansas City Union, USMCA, and the Mexican economy**\\]\n* Virtual Reality, gaming, AI with user-experience support, and fintech \\[**Zoomers & you**\\]", "created_utc": 1591862171.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h0utep/cloudflare_net_dd_cdns_cybersecurity_and_big_tech/", "is_self": true}
