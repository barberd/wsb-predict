{"id": "ezcqzn", "title": "Thoughts on GPRO", "selftext": "GoPro is reporting earnings today. Despite the fact that every YouTuber and their dog has at least 3 GoPros, and they're the only name-brand action cam, GPRO is still trading at $4.25 like a Goddamn penny stock. They just released their Hero 8 modela before Christmas and those things are lit. Ive owned a hero 3, hero 5, and hero 8 and the hero 8 is damn near magical. GoPro also just introduced their subscription repair/replacement plan which retails for $10 a month and provides discounts on all GoPro goods and unlimited no-questions-asked full replacement. They also have a trade-in program they're using to capture some of the existing action cams and remove them from circulation. Very smart imo.\n\nSo... GoPro has great technology. Not super unique but still the best in-class and definitely in name-recognition.  They're introducing interesting and attractive business models to customers. But the stock is so under valued..\n\nObviously this DD is all consumer perspective but Is GPRO going to shoot up like I think it is (eventually) or is there something I'm missing?", "created_utc": 1580922713, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ezcqzn/thoughts_on_gpro/", "is_self": true}
