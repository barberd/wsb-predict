{"id": "cr7m0c", "title": "My Drunken Summary On The First 7 Pages of GEnron Report", "selftext": "In true autist fashion, I saw the news yesterday and spent a decent percentage of my portfolio on GE puts. After doing so, I realized I had no idea why I did that and decided to read the report after spending my money. Here's a summary of the first 7 pages. Everything after the first 7 pages is the data and write-ups on how they found the data and their interpretations of that data that lead them to the conclusions they outline. I have no real financial experience or expertise and didn't understand most of what I read. You're welcome.\n\n\\----\n\n **GE Is Hiding $29 Billion ($29B) in Long-Term Care Losses**\u00a0  \n\n\n(Get used to the acronym LTC) according to this report. He lists off 3 \"Key Risks to GE's survival\".\u00a0  \n1. recession (Bear gang)  \n2. in 2021 GE will cease to have any positive cash flow. while simultaneously taking a $29B reserve hit for it's LTC liabilities. (Specifically Q1 2021)\u00a0  \n3. Assuming they survive both listed above, it will then have to repay $107B in debt, cover its $27B in pension liabilities. \u00a0(Note: He claims that GE has no cash and only earned $14.9B over last 7-years and these liabilities total over $160B)  \n\n\nHe then goes on to state that GE LTC situation is similar to AIG's Financial Products Corporation, which destroyed AIG. Compares AIG enjoying \"earnings\" as GE has reported. GE Capital (GEC) accounted for LTC insurance premiums in their earnings in the 1980's, 90's, and 2000's while also not funding adequate reserves to offset the LTC liabilities.\u00a0  \n\n\nSo far, 14% f LTC claims being filed has lead to a $15B reserve hit, 86.2% remain. \"GE\u2019s LTC losses will  \ncontinue rising at an exponential rate until it either files for bankruptcy protection or finds some way to out-earn its  \nLTC liabilities.\" They looked at the accounting by accessing and analyzing the SAP (statutory accounting rules) filings from the LTC insurers who were reinsuring with GE-ERAC showed them how much GE was losing each year. They found exponentially growing losses that they claim will bleed GE of additional cash such that GE is unlikely to become cash positive in 2021 and beyond (buzz lightyear voice).\u00a0  \n\n\nThey analyzed GE's 7 largest reinsurance deals, which account for approx. 95% of GE's total LTC reinsurance liabilities. They also analyzed GE's own reinsurer LifeCare. (You can see details on each reinsurance deal in Appendix I of the report) They provide notes throughout the report on how you can track down the reports/data yourself if you don't believe them.\u00a0  \n\n\nThey calculated GE should have taken a reserve hit as early as 2012, but no later than 2015. Instead GE waited for new management to come in and book what little reserve they could afford in late 2017/early 2018, a $15B commitment which required a special exemption from the Kansas Insurance Department (KID) to spread over a 7-year period because GE isn't liquid right now and likely won't survive long enough to make their last few years of reserve payments anyway.  \n\n\nGE\u2019s $15 Billion LTC reserve hit was a nasty market surprise and it\u2019s about to get $29 Billion worse.  \n\n\nWhile looking through the analysis, ask yourself 3 questions:\u00a0  \n1. Who's being transparent - GE or them  \n2. Who's showing GE's reinsurance losses by carrier by year, by dollar amount - GE or them  \n3. Who's accounting do you trust more?  \n\n\nThey show a comparison of GE to a responsible insurance carrier such as Prudential (PRU), GE needs $18.5B in additional reserves in order to be able to pay claims. GE also has a $10.5B difference between its $30.4B in statutory reserves and it's $19.9B of GAAP reserves. This difference will lead to a non-cash charge to earnings between now and the new insurance accounting rule change, which goes into effect in 1QTR 2021. This policy will result in a $10.5B hit to GE's shareholder equity cushion and put its credit rating and debt covenants at grave risk.\u00a0  \n\n\n\"To summarize, GE is hiding $29 Billion in additional  \nLTC losses from investors and our Whistleblower Report will walk you through the details using figures provided by eight  \nof GE\u2019s LTC counter-parties. Either those eight companies are lying and reporting false data or GE is.\"  \n\n\nThey end the LTC section with 2 questions for GE's management of LTC:  \n1. Make your agreements public  \n2. provide your LTC actuarial assumptions\u00a0  \n(neither of which are questions)  \n\\-----  \n**GE Is Hiding $9.1 Billion in Baker Hughes Losses**  \n\n\nGE's 2017 investment in Baker Hughes was bad and forced them to exit that investment in November 2018 when they sold 101.2 million BHGE shares in a secondary offering. GE booked a $2.2B pre-tax loss from that sale. GE then continued to account for it's shares in BHGE as a Non-Controlling Interest in 2018, despite the holding now strictly being an investment. If they had treated it as an investment, as accounting rules require, it would have incurred a $9.1B loss.\u00a0  \n\n\n\\------  \n**Why Didn\u2019t GE Disclose Its Working Capital of Minus $20.3B and Its Current Ratio of .67?**  \n\n\n\"The same $52B of Baker Hughes assets and $22B of revenues are reported on both GE\u2019s 2018 financial statements  \nand BHGE\u2019s where in reality, only one entity, BHGE actually controls these assets and cash flows. Backing out BHGE\u2019s  \ncash flow from operating activities (CFOA) reduces GE\u2019s 2018 CFOA from $2.257B to a meager $495M.\"  \n\n\n\"GE\u2019s 2018 year-ending working capital was minus $14.3B with BHGE and minus $20.3B without!\" GE then wilfully omitted working capital reports and disclosures in their 10-K and only discusses changes in working capital, but never gives you a true picture of their dire financial position. Provided in the report are working capital schedules for GE both with and without BGGE (Slide 104).  \n\n\nGE's current ratio is a stunningly low .67. The current ratio is not listed in GE's 2018 10-K so this is a number they had to calculate themselves.\u00a0  \nFinal 3 questions for KPMG, GE's auditors dating back to 1909:  \n1. What did you know?  \n2. When did you know it?  \n3. Where's your \"Going Concern Opinion?\"  \n\n\n\\-----  \n\n\nThe remainder of the report goes into how they analyzed GE and discovered the Fraud and the cues that have been missed by investors and analysts. Concluding remark that I thought was important to humanize the extent of this fraud:  \n\"I want to express my sympathy to the one million people who count on GE for either salaries, healthcare, or  \npensions. Make no mistake, GE\u2019s current and past employees are the victims here as are GE\u2019s lenders, vendors, and  \ncustomers all of whom have to deal with the aftermath of an accounting fraud. The only winners are GE\u2019s fat cat  \nexecutives who enriched themselves with undeserved bonuses as they drove this once proud beacon of American  \nbusiness into the ground. I encourage you to hold them accountable.  \nThank you very much for taking the time to read our Whistleblower Report, we hope you find it informative.  \nHarry Markopolos, CFA\u00ae, CFE\"  \n\n\nAfter this is over 160 pages of data and reports with notes on how to find those reports yourself if you don't trust them on it.\u00a0 \n\n\\----\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - GE is going to GEt fucked.
