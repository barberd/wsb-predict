{"id": "ev9ioz", "title": "My top picks for February to June", "selftext": "AAPL - Will not disappoint with ER or guidance. Coronavirus will have nominal impact on the operations and manufacturing end in China because the government has placed heavy sanctions against intercity and intra-city travel. Containment is in full effect now and biotechs are currently racing for a vaccine. This will likely improve relations between China and the U.S and Trump has extended a hand to help the Chinese. Double the win. Let's not forget their service-side and wearables department expanding at an unprecedented rate.\n\nPYPL - I love this one a lot. Paypal's integration into China's Union Pay is massively undervalued. The potential for both parties is extremely important. The exchange of data across the two platforms will be valuable for advertisers and the retail industry to tap into consumer appetites and trends. For those that don't know, Union Pay is the largest Chinese financial services company. Works much like a bank and is offered as a form of payment at many destinations across the U.S. However, there are fees associated and they are not made available for online retailers in the U.S. That being said, Paypal fills this gap very nicely. The Chinese, known for their appetite for purchasing American products and brands are going to rave all over the ability to access Paypal and American online retailers. The only thing left to do for them is to partner/buyout a logistics company that will set up the right network for them to ship goods into China.\n\nSBUX - Said it before and will say it again, I took profits from my early January buys and rolled them into safer $88/90/92.5 Calls. Currently sitting at a very small profit but I have a month out for some and 2 months for the others. It's been a pretty hectic week for this ticker because of the Coronavirus fears which will likely impact their sales in China because the 4,000 locations they have in China are going to account for a maximum of a quarter loss in revenue (only if they literally do not get any sales at all). But all that aside, I think this stock is positioned well for growth with their monopolization of the domestic market and their growing marketshare of the Chinese/global markets. Can't wait to see an outpouring of support for this stock soon. Rock on!\n\nMy hands are tired and I will not type more. But I have a few more on my list that I'd love to share.", "created_utc": 1580236840, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ev9ioz/my_top_picks_for_february_to_june/", "is_self": true}
