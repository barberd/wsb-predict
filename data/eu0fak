I check back in an hour and see my portfolio ripped me a hole large enough I can film 6 Hogs One Hole, a sequel to 2 girls 1 cup. What. F\\*ckin. Gives.\n\nGyna Aids???? I am sick of all these corona talks and illegitimate media outlets so I decided to do some digging myself. I went to the nearest Chinese supermarket to see what I can find, and guess what?? Not a dam corona pack or bottle to be seen. Nothing but sake and soju or fizzy soda in glass bottles. Ill be damned, a bunch of horse sheet all along. Out of frustration I bought a pack of fruity bubbalicious and shook hands with the asian security guard wearing a facemask and gloves as I walked out.  What a gentleman to care about the personal health of others and not spreading his cooties.\n\nAll that work driving around and walking got me riled up. Im now extremely sweaty and my room feels hotter than normal. Not to worry, Ill be able to afford AC once these Apple 400 calls pay off.", "created_utc": 1580004170, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eu0fak/corona_dd_with_my_great_and_unmatched_wisdom/", "is_self": true}
