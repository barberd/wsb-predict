{"id": "ctd7m8", "title": "Formula 1 DD on why you should be buying GE puts", "selftext": "Let me enlighten you all with a story of which you may not be familiar; the story of the Caterham Formula 1 racing team.\n\nCaterham was a Formula 1 racing team that raced 3 seasons of F1 racing from 2012-14. The team started off with trouble, coming fresh of a rebranding when the team principal had to switch the teams name from Lotus to Caterham for unrelated reasons. Now this car was slow as fuck and complete shit (comparatively to the other F1 cars, it'd still beat your Toyota Camry in a race), and therefore uncompetitive, let me tell you the sole reason for this. The Caterham F1 team was sponsored by none other than GE. If you look [here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjpgp7vrZPkAhVPbKwKHa5wDpIQjRx6BAgBEAQ&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fmiddleeast.geblogs.com%2Fen%2Flang-en%2Fge-scientists-right-at-home-in-an-f1-race-car%2F&amp;psig=AOvVaw1SC5n6cl4Q_QwtrOawbAbM&amp;ust=1566456095670413) you will see, just southeast of the drivers head, the big fat GE logo. GE was a sponsor of Caterham F1. Now that we have this [connection](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiD0ZK5rpPkAhUFPq0KHWKwAuwQjRx6BAgBEAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fknowyourmeme.com%2Fmemes%2Fpepe-silvia&amp;psig=AOvVaw3SlO8oHMw_klOaOSWI7YZi&amp;ust=1566456259170304) between GE and Caterham F1, we can see how obvious GEs inevitable bankruptcy is. In the end of 2014 season of racing, Caterham had to auction everything it had, and was 20mil in debt, all because the ~~bad car design and horrible team management~~ GE logo as is obvious. To cap off the short story, Caterham had to deal with its massive debt, the auctioning off of assets, and going bankrupt. Caterham was/ is a small scale GE, with shitty accounting out the ass, and bad leadership/driving constantly losing the team money.
