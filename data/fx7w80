On the likely chance that the fed is spending money in close relations to the decrease in consumer spending, the inflation rate will likely be stable (around 2.5) and in that case it will not imply anything besides JPow\u2019s huge forearms from all the cranking. \n\nDue to us being in uncharted territory with regard to the future of the market, it is likely that the fed could not predict how much they needed to spend to equalize the inflation rate and therefore it will likely be a good indicator of how much shit we\u2019re truly knee deep in. \n\nTLDR: inflation rate small or big = market go bye bye very soon.
