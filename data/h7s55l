Diamond Hands through it all. It rose to 95k (remember this was at 1k two weeks ago) and once went to 87k at moment SPY broke 300 on the downside. I sold out of TVIX and bought out the money puts on all overpriced stocks than need to fall.\n\nI wish I sold at the tops but I am happy with the gain I got. I just got some more VXX for next week too. Watch this market fall in the weekend. Congratz to anyone who followed me and made some gains!!!
