I am comfortable with some risk and am hoping to at least beat the market. Although obviously not too much risk! I've been reading a lot about buying the dip and this seems like a good time to buy what with the market beginning to recover. Do you guys have any favorite stocks that are sure bets? I want to to take my wife and her boyfriend out of state in a few years with a portion of the returns so I'm looking to only invest in some high performing stocks. If I could get 7% or even 8% return on my investment I think my wife might finally let sleep in the bed instead of in the kids room. Thanks in advance guys! Hope you have a nice day! I will keep you in my prayers!\n\nEDIT: SIIIIIIKE SPY 04/22 200$ FUCK YOU JPOW", "created_utc": 1587224354.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g3phae/investments_tips/", "is_self": true}
