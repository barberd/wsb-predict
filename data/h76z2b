After pissing away nearly 100k over the years about 10k per reload (always got cucked by PTD and margin calls back then and had no discipline). So I swore off options... then saw the feature in Bloomberg! Got approval in April and planned to leverage up my TSLA trades. Account 1 started with 50k, doubled that somehow churning shares, then ballooned it to 360k with options and mostly SPXS, SPXL. Serious FOMO seeing autists up big on all the morning gappers but stuck to avoiding overnight positions to protect my roll. Moved 100k out gradually to start Account 2 to firewall the options trades and trade both account P&Ls against each other. Instantly nearly blew up account 2 before reloading more to start fucking winning. Just finished withdrawing 100k from Account 2 to go debt free and pay the taxman. Heartfelt thank you fellow autists; even though I could've done it without you this is absofuckinglutely the way to trade through this economic shitstorm. And I still have Friday to blow up everything.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/osharqlbnc451.png?width=1326&format=png&auto=webp&s=473e6fb84df215d2605648ec80b82bf3eac9f7c3", "created_utc": 1591911013.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h76z2b/better_than_sex_50k_to_500k_since_february/", "is_self": true}
