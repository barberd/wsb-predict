{"id": "fup291", "title": "How the oil situation will probably blunt your puts harder (among other things)", "selftext": "I'm very anxious about my puts so I'm just typing with reckless abandon.\n\nHere are all of the reasons why the oil situation with Saudi Arabia + Russia is unlikely to favor put holders:\n\n1. Every country does have a rational reason to follow through with the deal. Because the world is going through a pandemic and oil prices are low,  all of these countries have industries that are bleeding hardcore and all have expressed an explicit interest to increase the price. While fucking over your competitiors might be a good idea to set the price you want after the recession, the fact of the matter is that the recession will last an uncertain amount of time and these countries know that torching their competitors into the floor is an uncertain and costly strategy, even if Russia and Saudi Arabia has a lot of cash. Even then, US oil companies can be started and subsidized by the government after the recession and all the US has a map of all known oil reserves to drill. The thing that would stop this agreement from going through would be a prisoners' dilemma type situation where one party, the US probably, is unwilling to lower their production. But every country is incentivized to have this deal go through because they are bleeding resources at the current moment.\n2. The real kicker is that, regardless of how this deal goes, Trump has demonstrated that he is perfectly willing to lie about how he has made deals. Anyone who was closely following the US-China trade war knows that this is true. Hell, last week, he lied about a phone call he might have made and the stock market still jumped. He'll almost certainly lie about the state of the deal on Twitter to stop a bloody Monday from further tarnishing his legacy.\n\nThere are a few things that might stop this deal from having an impact, allowing the market to finally collapse as it should:\n\n1. Russia and/or Saudi Arabia make negative announcements before Trump can bring out his phone to tweet. They categorically reject conciliatory measures with the US.\n2. Trump, instead of promoting a new deal, says that the other leaders fucking suck dick and throws a fit. This is unlikely, considering that he wants to actively save the stock market.\n3. MBS is already angry at Putin for refusing the deal last month and has publicly stated this. Putin might back off from the deal to save face.\n4. Perhaps the deal is already priced in. However, this is unlikely. If potential good news will spike the market, imagine what real good news would do. Even though the news isn't that fucking great to begin with and fixes no underlying problems in the economy, since when did the market care about underlying problems in the past few weeks? Record unemployment numbers that surpassed the anticipated numbers came out and the market barely flinched over the next two days.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe question next week is whether all those somewhat bearish investors sitting on the fence to sell will sell. The thing that is stopping them is the thought that this is the bottom. To us, it may seem obvious that it is not. But to them, these are their thoughts (probably):\n\n1. Unemployment was going to happen anyways. Worst case scenario is that it represents flexible labor markets when we begin to hire people using the government's money.\n2. Coronavirus killing people doesn't matter. What matters is that people will come purchase whatever we're selling after this pandemic is over using the government's money.\n3. Debt doesn't matter because I can finance my debt with more (in some cases, forgivable) debt using the government's money. After a certain point, company valuations become laughable, like in Japan's zombie firms.\n\nThere has to actively be something that pushes them over the edge to get them to sell en masse. It might be something that triggers an algo or literally some Trump or some other significant important figure like JPow getting coronavirus.\n\ntl;dr: I'm feeling anxious about my 235P SPY 4/20 and 245P SPY 5/1 (yes, those are my actual strikes). I'm really worried that there are just not enough institutional investors willing to sell at this point and they get excited over stupid shit that we know doesn't matter over the next few years.", "created_utc": 1585983361.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fup291/how_the_oil_situation_will_probably_blunt_your/", "is_self": true}
