Works for a big company run by a turtle without a shell, master of disguise looking ass dude. Got into an argument. This motherfucker thinks this is the optimal time to invest in the economy. This dude is showing off his 10% gains and his fucking and explaining why he's investing in oil right now. I get into an argument with him about how Hump and Dump Donny has manipulated the markets this past month. He denies it, says all the bullshit you expect to hear, \"unemployment didn't surpass expectations, Trump is just being Trump, and the Market is forward thinking.\"\n\nI just wanted to point out this anecdotal case study, because I think this is how most people think. No one truly believes we are in an economic crisis. No one truly believes the government is manipulating the stock market. No one truly believes we have a problem. Everyone thinks we've already moved past the worst of it. Especially people who write articles that retail investors consume. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. \n\nFor those of us who analyze financials, leverage, and forecast scenarios... it doesn't matter. Just because you make the smart decision doesn't mean it's the right decision. We like to say we're autists, but if 99 SPEDS all believe the market will go up, the market will go up. Just because you're right doesn't mean you'll make tendies. Play the people, not the stock.\n\nSPY 265p 05/15, 270p 6/19\n\nEDIT: Added positions", "created_utc": 1588036503.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9dp7p/why_market_isnt_crash_crash/", "is_self": true}
