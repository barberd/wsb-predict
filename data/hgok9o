{"id": "hgok9o", "title": "My Investment Hypothesis", "selftext": "*i wrote this for a specific comment but I decided to share*\n\nMy background of plays... i have a $300k portfolio. I predominately sit in passive etfs. Frankly, they\u2019re the play. Avoid a lot of dumb risk through diversified holdings. Reap 6-12% a years. I\u2019ve played LEAPS on some simple logic plays, DIS options on Disney plus potential (was not properly priced, imo) and FB options on election ad revenue. These were 1/15/21 leaps I bought in January, before corona. I escaped up $12k in May... I held through hell. Down $30k at one point. DIS was sold for a loss and FB was big win.\n\nNow...\n\nI believe the market was disregarding the widespread, wildfire nature of covid. The spread of NYC was catastrophic. I knew the south would be a hot spot approaching summer due to AC. AC has been shown by the CDC to reinforce viruses reach.\n\nSo, on June 3rd, I pulled about $70k of cash from portfolio. I figured the recovery was over treading the actual recovery. Then, the market carried up 3-5% on Wednesday (June 5th). I pulled another $130k of cash from portfolio. So, $200k cash and $100k diversified, passive.\n\nI invested $20k in a double short Brazilian etf, I believe they\u2019re a mortal lock for Covid and this would HEDGE my $100k us stock - if we start falling.\n\nOn Thursday, there was a blood bath, -6%. If there was a dead bounce Friday (below 3%), I would buy. Market tilted up, 1%? But, that\u2019s nothing after a huge sell off. Airlines, cruises, and hotel/casino BOUNCED 10-15%. So, I figured the market really thought wave 2 wouldn\u2019t happen. So, I bought puts on the logical bets: airlines (UAL), cruises (CCL), and Hotel/Casino (MGM). 7/17, $50k total, on Friday June 5th.\n\nI was down $15k a week ago. I\u2019m now up $25k (avoiding losses from market dropping from heights I sold, spy 320?). I\u2019m holding until a major sell off around 4th of July. I\u2019m expecting SPY 275 (+/- 15). The FED wants to deflate the bubble (balance sheet REDUCING in back to back weeks). FED will let a drop to 270, but will then let it slow bleed.\n\nFrom there, I may join theta gang with a tilt towards downward bleed. Sell comfortable saddles to rake premiums in a good range. I\u2019d be comfortable with writing covered calls too. I\u2019ll consider writing saddles around cloud-based companies (MSFT and Amazon, first come to mind). I believe the downsides of their models are bolstered by their clouds. more Covid, more work from home, more cloud. also, if market pops, they won\u2019t be the first brigade up. Travel, etc. will carry. I need to learn more about credit spreads and the like to be comfortable executing such a trade.\n\nI\u2019m considering playing puts across the entire auto industry with a hedge in a reliable car manufacturer (sorry, not Tesla boys). Ford? I\u2019d likely play these towards 8/21 puts that are out of the money. I would likely do the call on ford a bit out, also for 8/21. No one is driving... there is supposed to be summer spike to oil prices... not even close this year. Spring is a car buying season... it starts in March and carries the entire spring. Who was buying cars during a global pandemic shutting down the nation? No one; people were hoarding money (April or may was highest savings month ever). So, earnings will be catastrophic for auto, imo, especially fucking TSLA. I\u2019ll probably look to allocate $40k to the automaker puts and $15k to ford calls. There could be auto bailout discussions like 08, but I don\u2019t know.\n\nI believe my hypothesis is fucked by huge vaccine news, a lack of hospitalizations and deaths in TX, FL, AZ, and CA. I believe AZ is most fucked (almost mortal lock, oops). I believe we could tank on bad housing news or consume/student defaults. A tech bubble is flirted about on this sub, I don\u2019t buy it. Tech is the future and foundational for the economy, as it should be with long term growth views, especially with shift to more downtime at home.\n\nLong-term, I am worried for actual Wave 2, but I hope with greater knowledge of steroids, remdesivir, and plasma, we will be able to weather the storm. I believe SPY 220 leaps for 1/15 could be juicy. I\u2019d consider SPY 220 and SPY 350 strangle as a better alternative. I\u2019d wait for volatility to settle down a bit, hopefully near 270... we could also float 300 flat for 1 month, who knows.\n\nI\u2019d be happy to take questions to fill any gaps I inevitably missed. I don\u2019t know a lot, but I do know somethings.\n\nTLDR:\n\n- Spy puts 7/17 285\n- Auto puts 8/21 (10% below current price), id buy a hedge in reliable automaker for 8/21 (ford)\n- Starting end of July, if my prediction holds, I\u2019d buy reaching leaps for 220 spy and 350 spy for 1/15/21. I would have saddles around cloud-based companies (MSFT and Bezos)\n- Theta gang with a tilt to slow bleed after July 4th selloff", "created_utc": 1593239581.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hgok9o/my_investment_hypothesis/", "is_self": true}
