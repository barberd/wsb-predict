{"id": "fp3gus", "title": "Its not a stimulus, its a relief.", "selftext": "Some of you were in grade school when George W. Bush handed out checks to every American in  2008. Those checks came at a time somewhat early in the financial crisis, February 2008. With those checks his goal was to avoid a recession. \n\nThose checks were 600 per individual and 300 per child. \n\n\nWhat is being voted on tonight and probably tomorrow is a bill that is not being done to prevent a recession. We are in a recession. It is not a bill designed to stimulate the economy, it is a bill to prevent economic collapse. \n\nIt is not a fucking stimulus. It is a disaster relief. \n\nIf you think we are at bottom and we've no further to go, and that everything will get better because of this bill, you are wrong. I could throw insults here, but that is unnecessary, if you are a bull right now you are an insult to yourself. \n\nThe only way our current low could end up being our bottom is if all these prayers are answered, and Jesus Christ comes down from heaven and puts a stop to this disease. Barring that, we are in for a long and bumpy ride and I suggest you position yourself in such a way that you don't lose your money on it. \n\nIn ROTH - DUST (5%), SH (90%), VIXY (5%)\n\nOptions - SPY 190p 5/1, SPY 243p 5/1, BAC 18p 9/15, BKLN 20p 1/21\n\nEdit: Senate passes, futures drop.", "created_utc": 1585189417.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fp3gus/its_not_a_stimulus_its_a_relief/", "is_self": true}
