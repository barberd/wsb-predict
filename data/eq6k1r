{"id": "eq6k1r", "title": "I hate Chinese stocks, but here is a case for $NIO", "selftext": "1. China has a long history of pirating IP. We all know this is going to happen with Nio and Tesla, 100%. Everything in that factory is going to be copied...so the car-dreadnaught assembler for the Y? copied. The motor? Copied. The battery mix? They'll try as hard as they can....Every single Chinese person in that factory will know that if they can take IP to Nio, they'll ge ta big fat check. The trade war was unable to halt this, so nothing has changed Chinese incentives regarding IP. \n2. Elon is OK with \\^. Guaranteed. He knows the Chinese are mostly thieves and liars when it comes to trade and IP. Elon has literally said before he would let TESLA fail if it meant electrifying the future of transportation. He will still have good China market access for the next few years, make serious tendies, export cheaper made cars to the U.S., and also accomplish his goal of electrifying the world through this and inevitable Nio IP theft.\n3. China subsidizes and supports strategic industries....China has a big oil problem. Oil is dragging Chinese interests into the middle east, which they would love to ignore. Foreign policy is a risky venture for Chinese premieres, as China doesn't have the (1) expertise, (2) global reach (rapidly rapidly changing), (3) inclination, or (4) alliance network to effectively handle security issues far away from their home areas. Yeah, they have sent ships to XYZ, but its different than, for example, trying to make sure Iran and Saudi don't go to war and throw oil through the roof. Plus, Chinese oil reliance is a big strategic concern. Google the China malacca dilemma. It a big deal, but I won't write a ton on it here. They want to wean off oil, that's the gist. A naval blockade is a huge thing in the Chinese defense media sphere. Its a big driver for their military development (the malacca dilemma). \n4. Electric cars are a great export item. Imagine if Nio can start competing with Tesla around the world. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNio looks cheap af. I hate the idea of owning a Chinese stock, but everything I've written \\^ is really, REALLY establishment thinking, and not outside the box. It seems inevitable.", "created_utc": 1579295450, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eq6k1r/i_hate_chinese_stocks_but_here_is_a_case_for_nio/", "is_self": true}
