{"id": "d5xc14", "title": "Honest opinion", "selftext": " Hello! I would like your honest opinion about these 3 topics:\n\n* CFA (and all those levels)\n* MBA (or any master degree)\n* Wallstreetprep (Premium package)\n\nI'm currently with a lot of time, almost done with my bachelor degree (5 years to be an accountant in my country), and i would like to invest my next years into The Capital Market.\n\nWhat would you think it's the best to start with? I was thinking maybe i should start with the Wallstreet prep course and then the MBA. Or if you have another idea for a better CV i would love to hear it. I could move to the US and apply for a scholarship (here we have a lot of these, but I don't know to which one apply xD)\n\nI want to move from my country, despise the fact that i could live with a very good economic situation, but I want more in my life.\n\nWhat do you think? I would like to know your honest opinions about this subject, and a little bit of a path to walk, I don't have anyone to talk this about, I don't have an adviser or something like that to put me on the right path, so I'm recurring to you guys! The first thing i would like to be answer is: \"What would you do, if you were me?\"\n\nI hope I could get understand, sorry for my bad english! :D", "created_utc": 1568811130, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d5xc14/honest_opinion/", "is_self": true}
