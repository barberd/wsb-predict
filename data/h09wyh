{"id": "h09wyh", "title": "AAL DD: MUST SHORT AT CURRENT PRICE OF 18 BUCKS", "selftext": "Airlines are a notoriously low margin, competitive business. There are highly restrictive regulations surrounding training+safety which give labor unions a large amount of bargaining power. Airplane fuel, airplane maintenance, and airplanes are all extremely expensive as well. It is also highly competitive. This is why Warren Buffet hates the industry-in 2013 he said *\u201c*Investors have poured their money into airlines for 100 years with terrible results..*.*It's been a death trap for investors.\u201d\n\nTake a look at American Airlines business in normal economic conditions. Here are some financial statistics from Q4 2019. These are all taken from their 10q.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f5832t7st2451.png?width=990&format=png&auto=webp&s=e11c0fc2cae69fef4df0e1263c1242d192996094\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTotal operating revenues: 45,768 million\n\n\\-93% of revenues are from passenger sales\n\nTotal operating expenses: 42,703 million \n\n\\-29.5% of expenses are for labor. These costs are FIXED until September 30: per the terms of the CARES act, AAL is restricted from firing a single worker until then. Therefore, any layoffs must be involuntary w/severance packages. \n\n\\-9.4% of expenses are for aircraft payment+depreciation. These are also fixed. \n\n\\-17.9% of expenses are regional expenses, which are just all the expenses for their regional carrier (American Eagle). That carrier has similar expense composition. \n\nInterest expenses: 1,095 million - also fixed. \n\nAAL also has the worst management out of the top American Airlines. For a quick comparison, Delta (considered the best managed airline) in Q4 had a net income of 1,099 million with an operating revenue of $11,439 million- - a significantly better profit margin. \n\nSo, the financial statements make it clear that AAL has razor thin margins and completely relies on their gigantic volume of low margin flights (AAL is the largest airline in the world by passengers carried). \n\nNow, let's look their revenue outlook for 2020.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n07yyh9ut2451.png?width=919&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7c9ef2f84ad3b0edcf0e8d2f3b742b39d6cf912\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wpu0bzjvt2451.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&s=153258835c6a313d196a63328602fe6c09a01fd6\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cmuz38uwt2451.png?width=882&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7c912c6f30e5e46642ade0965beb324a0e97393\n\nThe graphs speak for themselves-the industry has been absolutely decimated, and the little amount of recent demand has been sparked by extremely low prices. American Airlines also relies heavily on international travel + business travel, unlike more leisure focused airlines like JetBlue and Southwest. This makes them even more screwed. \n\nNow, lets look at the balance sheet- taken from Q1 2020\n\nTotal assets: 58,580 million \n\nCurrent Liabilities: 19,213 million  \n\nNon Current Liabilities: 42,003 million \n\nShareholder equity: -2,636 million \n\nThis horrible, horrible financial health is why American\u2019s debt is rated well under junk bond status. Because of the very real bankruptcy risk, they are having trouble raising money even in today\u2019s easy money environment. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/de5vd6fyt2451.png?width=790&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8e5d6a3e92ab785de08fa1c2f9b12473ef5dd79\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mz3uyzszt2451.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b6dc4195fabf02cdec3a9d5d4ea6d5b133add91\n\nIn just 5 days, their stock has almost doubled. What sparked this rise? AAL management stated that they predict July 2020 to have 55% the demand as July 2019, and have modified their schedule as such.\n\nAs you can see from the forward booking graphs, this demand is simply non existent.35% of their float was also sold short, which means the run up was a classic short squeeze. On top of all of that, AAL is the perfect example of a prized retail investor stock\u2014 gigantic company that the average person would never predict to be financially fucked, and is willing to buy like crazy, not knowing a single thing about finance. \n\nAAL is the airline that is in by far the worst shape financially due to utter mismanagement, therefore I highly doubt they will be bailed out. Bankruptcy is a very, very real possibility.\n\nTLDR: The entire airline industry is fucked. AAL is even more fucked because of their insane amount of debt. \n\nPosition: Buy puts on AAL, expiration date Q4 (after CARES act support runs out)", "created_utc": 1591792252.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h09wyh/aal_dd_must_short_at_current_price_of_18_bucks/", "is_self": true}
