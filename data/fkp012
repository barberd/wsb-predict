And they want shit that's shelf stable.  ($KHC could be another opportunity, but its run by a bunch of moronic Brazilians who are pals with Bolosnoro. They seriously fucked up Heinz ketchup long before the beer flu.  They fucked up $BUD and $QSR (burger  king, popeyes, tim hortons) as well. Off topic, but they truly are retarded. )\n\nLook at $BSX which makes medical supplies and not just killer robots.  PTON as well, people will continue to pay their monthly subscription to get exercise.  \n\nJust a thought to regain some of your bullishness in these bearish times... cant just do spy calls anymore, gotta be more focused.  The market is going to continue to get its salad tossed. \n\nGIS $60c 4/17\nBSX $33c 4/17\nPTON $26c 4/24\nSPY $200p 4/24", "created_utc": 1584535775.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkp012/bull_plays/", "is_self": true}
