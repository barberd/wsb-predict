How to trade biotech like an autist.", "selftext": "I'm a total noob and by no means an expert, but some of you are fully 'tarded and 95% of my trades are in biotech. So I'm gonna offer what I know. Biotech is a purely binary event driven market. If someone is shilling you some bs pennystock you need to go to biopharmcatalyst.com and check the calenders there. If it doesn't have anything coming up then stay out. \n\n\nIt's unfortunate that Amarin's stock price is gonna get smashed again, but it is. Fundamentally the company is undervalued by biotechs are bizzaro land so the only play on AMRN is LEAPS, eventually some catalyst may come along and raise it up but it's impossible to know what or how right now. I took an earnings position (18, 18.50, and 19 calls for 3/06) on Amarinthe Friday before last, and was going to sell today because that's the play in biotech. IV crush and sell the news will destroy you unless it's a surprise or early announcement, in which case stock prices can spike immensely. So the strategy for biotech binary events (earnings, phase 2/3 data, and PDUFAs; don't try and play NDAs) is purely in the run up. Get in 1.5-3 weeks ahead with near the money prices and sell at the last possible second before market close ahead of an announcement.\n\nAnyway; why didn't I sell today? Because I sold Thursday when the market started tanking because AMRN is a weak as shit stock with 60% short interest and 25% profit was better than eating shit. \n\nP.S.biotechs are shit right now, very dry couple of months ahead. Long bearish bio-tech ETFs.\n\nP.S.S. you're too late on Gilead or Moderna.", "created_utc": 1582666570, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9hp8b/amrn_why_you_buttfucked_if_you_held_thru_earnings/", "is_self": true}
