It\u2019s clear that it\u2019s not becoming less legal anytime soon...we will only see more and more states and countries legalizing it as the years go on and there\u2019s proven to be a huge market for it. Was bullish on CGC last year but got out (complete luck) right before the downturn and loss of their CEO.  \n\nThey have a new, finance minded CEO from constellation. Constellation isn\u2019t backing down on their investment and is (for now) sticking behind them. My hope is that the new leadership can make smart financial decisions and navigate this tricky growth phase. Stock is down more than double from its highs of last year, and is leveling out around $20 for the last month or so...is the bad news baked into the price? Is now the time to jump?", "created_utc": 1578083942, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ejld3i/is_now_the_time_to_buy_canopy_growth_cgc/", "is_self": true}
