{"id": "feukms", "title": "Short Canadian Banks", "selftext": "Canadian banks have come down much less than American banks. This is due to the reason that during 2008, Canadian banks fared very well compared to its American counterparts. \n\nHowever, I\u2019m telling you that this is wrong. This time it\u2019s absolutely the opposite. There is a huge housing bubble here in Canada in the 2 key metro areas of Toronto and Vancouver. Less so in other major metros but a non insignificant amount of loans are made to just these 2 places. Median household income in Canadian dollars in these 2 locations are less than 75k CAD while housing prices are north of 850k. Detached averaging more than 1m and even condos are averaging 750k now. \n\nPeople still believe the prices are being driven up by foreigners but that is not so for about 2 years now. To be fair there is a supply and demand issue but the pricing is still being driven by speculators who use their previous housing equity to borrow money to buy more housing. \n\nTl:dr\n\nShort any Canadian banks and make bank.\n\nEdit: BNS sept 45$ put. And if you got access to the tsx the Canadian tickers have longer dated options. Retard spreads though.\n\nEdit2: any of these: BNS RY CM BMO TD", "created_utc": 1583584503.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/feukms/short_canadian_banks/", "is_self": true}
