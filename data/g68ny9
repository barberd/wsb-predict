I\u2019m your host and resident autist u/expander2. You have to be able to read to gain anything from this so that rules out about half of you. As always, this is organized from most important at the top to least important at the bottom. A TLDR, plays, and previous DD summaries will be at the bottom. My last posts still stand and hold some good info so check it out for more plays if this isn't enough for you greedy fucks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've got a lot for you today so let's get into it. First is my favorite play for this post. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ATVI;** So somebody brought this Activision (ATVI) play to my attention so I [checked out this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g542sx/activision_is_going_to_smash_83_and_hit_new_ath/) and did a little research. With the immense popularity of their game Warzone and a player base that has nearly doubled because of the quarantine, ATVI is set to crush earnings. Warzone is a free game however they have a battle pass and cosmetic items that can be paid for with real money. Free games with optional purchases make bank. Just look at Fortnite which became a multi-million dollar game over the course of a couple of months. With Warzone and the Modern Warfare games skyrocketing in popularity, ATVI is a safe bet for an earnings play. It also has been fairly ignored. Quarantine stocks are hot right now with Netflix, Amazon, Shopify, etc. all skyrocketing. What isn't skyrocketing is the gaming industry which is set to make just as much from everyone being inside. EA, Activision, Take-Two Interactive, and other gaming companies will make on this so we need to get in on it before the rest of the market catches on and drives premiums up. I got a 5/8 $79c for .40 today. Jump in before it's too late. Activision reports earnings 5/5 which means anything after that is a good bet. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SQ;** Square (SQ) is a very good bet if you want puts. Square Revenue for 2019 was $4,472,473 USA and $241,027 International (thousands). This means that the US is the primary location for sales clearly. The US is also locked down. Small businesses are the primary sellers and are,\n\n>\"disproportionately adversely affected by economic downturns and may fail at a higher rate than larger or more established businesses\u201d\n\naccording to a statement made by Square themselves. Sure some small businesses can sell online but square processes by swipes so even if they are selling online Square themselves aren't getting anything. Here's what you can take away from this; SQ WILL LOSE MONEY BECAUSE OF THE SHUTDOWN. That's just what is going to happen. This is compounded by the fact that they pay their debt based on their swipes processed so it's just gonna stay stagnant and generate interest for a couple of months. Take into account that a lot of small businesses are going to fail and you have a recipe to make money on puts here. [OP of the post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5vd6p/square_inc_sq_puts_lets_be_rational/) says $50p 6/19 but from the looks of it, they are gonna drop before that. Earnings are on 5/6 so 5/8 and after is smart for puts. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TSN;** [This post gets into](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5h736/tyson_getting_butchered/) the details surrounding Tyson (TSN) and the amount of trouble they are in. Their plants seem to be a hot spot for the Beer Flu. Places like Council Bluffs near Omaha NE, Perry IA, Waterloo IA, Logansport IN, and Sioux City IA are all getting slammed with cases while Tyson hides from the media. Their price is going to tank. This isn't even taking into account the immense drop in demand for meat nations worldwide. They aren't even shutting down the plants yet and one of their employees just died. [According to this post](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g59pwp/rfarming_says_us_meat_production_is_screwed/), COVID19 is wreaking havoc on meat processing plants causing oversupply to the point of farmers facing the decision to \"dispose\" of animals or sell at a loss. Get puts for a little bit out and watch Tyson drop like a stone. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is getting really long already so I'm not going to do a write up about Wayfair (W) just [check out this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5nzid/furniture_its_that_thing_youre_sitting_on/) and remember that it is also an online shopping company and a lot of people are sitting at home wishing they had different furniture. One more thing, u/fuzzyblankeet, where you at my man? I miss you out here in the land of fucking retards. It\u2019s a dark place without your beautiful essays on how not to be a dumb stupid idiot. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck fuckers and tune in on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for more WSB DD Summaries!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR;** Activision is gonna make some money, Square is gonna lose some money, Tyson is gonna lose a lot of money, IDGAF about Wayfair, I miss you Fuzzy.\n\n**Plays;** ATVI calls at $70+ for 5/8 and after, SQ puts at $50- for 5/8 and after, TSN puts at $50- for 5/15 and after, W calls at $100+ for 5/15 and after.\n\n**Previous WSB DD Summaries;** [4/9-4/13](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0nkrl/summary_of_dd_from_49413_insider_trading_oil/), [4/14-4/15](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1x0y4/dd_from_414415_echostar_hasbro_yelp_and_shit_tldr/), [4/16-4/20](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g50ip3/dd_from_416420_dis_shop_and_bear_porn_tldr_and/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDISCLAIMER; I am not personally advocating for any play that I add to this list.
