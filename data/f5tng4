I've basically eaten shit on every single trade I've undertaken (got started a month ago). One of you autists posts some shit, I think \"No fucking way, that's not gonna happen\" I do the \"logical play\", then 4 days later some guy is posting 800% wins with a shit eating grin and I'm calling **myself** the retard.  \n\n\nSo I've come to seek your wisdom - BYND has earnings coming up (February 27th if I'm not mistaken) and they've also been getting sued for a month or so now ([https://investorplace.com/2020/02/beyond-meat-stock-trouble-legal-concern/](https://investorplace.com/2020/02/beyond-meat-stock-trouble-legal-concern/)). I'm thinking I go for some early March $90 puts and hope for a shitty ER? What are you retards thinking, will I make tendies or blow my shit up and post loss porn of the miserable 600ish bucks I'm gonna spend?", "created_utc": 1582040573, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f5tng4/bynd_are_getting_sued_march_puts_boys/", "is_self": true}
