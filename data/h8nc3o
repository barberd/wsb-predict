I've been around the block long enough to know reaching out to WSB is like asking for someone to pee in your cereal, but I'm feelin lucky tonight.  I'm a full time trader that wanted to throw up some banger art on his office wall and couldn't find anything so I hired some designers and bam...built up a side hustle.  \n\n\nNot going to put a link on here so I stay chill with the spam rules, but wanted to throw up a few of my pieces and ask the kewl kids what you like best as a trader.  Like if you actually made those tendies, is this the type of wow factor you'd want to buy, or would you rather just throw it all in NKLA calls for days?  Both make sense to me.  Lemme know your fave, peace.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Bull Hundo](https://preview.redd.it/rz5y8vsb1t451.png?width=3317&format=png&auto=webp&s=aae9ee9a22d4b881ba52a3f178597fba0612e524)\n\n  \n\n\n[Bulls Win](https://preview.redd.it/3p7ldy5e1t451.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=7598481e631e0561bc94d16c688b146c1174eeee)\n\n  \n\n\n[Modern Bearish Trader](https://preview.redd.it/30wiz1vg1t451.jpg?width=3317&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6b472470cfbfaba204f9bd65700ad35d8ad06999)\n\n  \n\n\n[Reminder why those tendies never made it out of your robinhood acount](https://preview.redd.it/pm8vmpli1t451.jpg?width=3317&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee96b49ddaac6166243b82eccd959a2712b7e88a)", "created_utc": 1592109546.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h8nc3o/tendies_buy_the_good_things_in_life/", "is_self": true}
