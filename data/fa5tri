{"id": "fa5tri", "title": "Suffering from Success.", "selftext": "Yup. Long story short, I have always bought calls and 100% of the time my options expired worthless. I never had to worry about selling or exercising my option. However, last week I bought a few  $SPCE puts ($32.5 expire 2/28). Now my puts are printing money on RH and I don't know what to do with it. I don't have enough buying power to exercise the option. So if I leave my puts as it is, will RH exercise it for me? Or, do I have to sell my puts before market closes tomorrow? I am worried because I have only one day left until the expiration day.", "created_utc": 1582774186, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fa5tri/suffering_from_success/", "is_self": true}
