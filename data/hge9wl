{"id": "hge9wl", "title": "PCG Gang -- Some clarity for you.", "selftext": "I'll keep this as short as I can because I know you retards have the attention span of a chipmunk. I've been part of the PCG gang for about 2 months, slowly watching my positions bleed out--but I'm not worried. I'll tell you why. \n\nRecent events:\n\n1. PCG got the signed confirmation that they are to exit Ch. 11 around the 1st of July. \n\n2. As part of the exit they are selling 42,337,263 shares of common stock (at $9.50 each) and 1,454,545 prepaid stock contracts to create up to 1,454,545 equity units(at $100.00 each).\n\n3. Those equity units are set to be listed under the ticker PCGU.\n\n4. The broad aspects of this event were released on the 22nd which explains the decline this week while the institutions suppressed the price for a more favorable position in the new share purchase.\n\nNow here's the important part:\n\n**In August 2023, all Equity Units are to be converted to common PCG stock at a maximum settlement rate of 10.5263 shares per unit.** From now until the conversion those units will pay out STRIP bond interest at the rate of about 5% per year for 3 years. \n\nThis means that the PCG ticker will remain and won't be devalued by the existence of these equity shares except for the standard market dilution you would expect from a large issuance of new shares. They are distinct for now, but, **if** PCGU becomes tradeable on the NYSE the values will follow each other until the time that the shares are converted and PCGU is delisted. I suspect that we will not see the PCGU ticker listed and that it's only been registered as a formality as equity shares are generally not traded. Also take note that the MAXIMUM settlement rate is 10.5263 shares per unit, it's possible that the ratio will be lower at the time of conversion.\n\nThe market as a whole recently has been very weak, sentiments have been very low, even I got an itchy trigger finger this morning and felt like I wanted to get out of my PCG positions and forget the whole thing after the stop trade resulted in a whole lot of nothing. So instead, I DCA'd and bought more shares and calls because in my mind, it's all on sale.\n\nIf you're going to get in, look for longer term plays or even LEAPS. If you don't want to have your capital tied up that long look for a different play entirely. I don't expect it to have a 30% day any time soon but I wouldn't rule it out as a possibility after the BK exit is confirmed. Analysts are have the target prices in the $13-15 range right now but, in this market analysts are pretty much useless so take that for what you will. I hedged my call position by also buying some of the stock and am prepared to hold it possibly through 2021 because even in a long bear market utilities are a decent hedge. Good luck.\n\nPCG 8/19 $15c", "created_utc": 1593199882.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hge9wl/pcg_gang_some_clarity_for_you/", "is_self": true}
