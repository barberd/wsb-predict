That's still true! And today the price is much more attractive. NAT is still selling for ~double its net asset value. EURN is selling for ~60% of its net asset value. 56% of NAT's fleet will reach scrap age in the next 5 years while EURN on average is 12 years from scrap age. \n\nhttps://robintrack.net/symbol/NAT\n\nI made the following post to go through NAT and explain why it's a bad investment:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/calvinfroedge/status/1256605350016450562\n\nTLDR:\n\n- The stuff Cramer said in their interview was false\n- NAT doesn't benefit that much from storage (their ships aren't big enough)\n- NAT is the most over valued tanker name by far, despite having the oldest fleet by far\n- NAT has issued equity 15 times in the past 20 years\n- NAT dividend yield will be among the lowest of those tanker equities who pay dividends\n- NAT has virtually no chance of paying its debt before ships reach scrap age", "created_utc": 1588702892.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ge32zx/4_of_robinhood_nat_holders_sold_in_the_past_24/", "is_self": true}
