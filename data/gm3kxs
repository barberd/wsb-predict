If you recognize me I'm the retard that advised everyone to buy CPB calls last week. Well I got out Thursday at a 70 percent profit and now CPB is down 2.5 percent as a pullback due to being green for 5 fucking straight days.  The situation right now is that people are panicking that CPB had a pullback, but stocks do not only go up lol. Also the chart shows that CPB is known for pullbacks.\n\nReasons for this trad not being a complete gamble from company perspective\n\n1. CPB is a food and snack provider of the following foods such as goldfish, milano crackers, prego sauce, soup (no shit).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lb05vlsbijz41.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=1cba10587eef0df3cc8065c0ff3a81649e73d86f\n\n2. Their last earnings was early March which does not accurately show the panic buying in all of our nearby grocery stores. Next earnings are on June 3rd therefore making this play viable with a less than 30 percent IV. \n\n3. From the technical aspect of this trade, the RSI looks to have pulled from 70 (overbought) to 56 which should only be thought of as a pullback. Also the MACD line looks a little choppy but all of this will change with one green day. From analyzing the chart it seems pullbacks last at most 2 days. I still entered 75 percent of my position today in-case of a major dip, but the calls are so cheap it literally can't go much lower. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Photo for you autists that are illiterate](https://preview.redd.it/y7m79w4zijz41.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=3242818281dbb7479c14218be40df4c0d3f29bc1)\n\n4. 5 year chart shows a crash around 2017, a slow demised death, until 2019 where their products started picking up and now COVID is also ramping up sales. Not to mention how they have beat earnings 6 times in a row. Think to keep in mind here is that this stock does not move much on earnings itself, but moves fast in anticipation of it. This is where us autists start cashing out.\n\n5. I FUCKING KNOW VOLUME IS LOW. I do not know why you autists care so much about volume on a play where earnings are more than 2 weeks away. No shit volume is going to be low on a play where earnings are 2 weeks away... volume comes with price action. Remember that. This play picked up volume when I first swung this and lost volume on a red day, today. It's expected to see low volume and price on a day where people are panicking... \"Buy high, sell low\"- Buffet. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: This is a COVID play that is not getting much attention and had a recent pullback.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**POSTIONS: 6/5 56.5c     6/5 56c  6/5 55c**\n\n**Be careful of some spreads... get in at a nice entry point and you'll make big.** \n\n**What I have previously swung... 6/5 55c from .55-1.05     6/5 56c from .3 to .55, 6/5 56.5c .3 to .45**", "created_utc": 1589815784.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gm3kxs/reading_cpb_calls/", "is_self": true}
