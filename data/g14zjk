{"id": "g14zjk", "title": "AMC Literally cant go tits up", "selftext": "Listen up, retards. Now is the time to make our move. AMC has been an American staple FOREVER and isn't going away any time soon. I propose that given AMC is going nowhere and has survived similar situations, it literally can't go tits up and now is the perfect time to buy, regardless of any bankruptcy talk we see. It's very likely that a bigger company might buy AMC. Someone like Netflix or Disney. Imagine the fucking gains if that happens and you get in soon. But that isn't the master plan, just a bonus. I'm proposing something much bigger. A takeover. That's right, a WSB takeover. With enough us, and the power of our autism and tendies, we can single-handedly save the American economy AND become majority shareholders.\n\nImagine it. AMC majority owned collectively by a bunch of retarded gamblers. Strippers, X-rated films, cigars, and liquor. We could have it all! And let's be real, that's a better business than whatever the fuck AMC has been doing. Might be short term losses, but med/long term gains if we actually pull this off. Worst comes to worse we can just pump and dump.\n\nIf we can get the ball rolling with enough of us to hold the price up or raise it fast enough, the news would be nuts. Bloomberg: \"AMC stock rises 200% in 48 hours. With this turn of events, what looked like certain death for AMC has turned around into one of the most underdog bull runs of the century!\" This will attract tons of normies and people with FOMO.\n\nThis might seem like a yolo, or a shitpost but I am very serious. This could be the biggest move WSB has ever collectively done. Whether we save the company or perform a HUGE pump and dump, we win. Literally can't go tits up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTldr: AMC 5$C 5/16", "created_utc": 1586868810.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g14zjk/amc_literally_cant_go_tits_up/", "is_self": true}
