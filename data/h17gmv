ZI will do to sales people what amazon did to retail shoppers.  this is such a massive leap i am positive Microsoft or google will buy this company.  i made tons of money when microsoft bought linkedin.  linkedin was only trading for a short time but MS had to buy it.  If MS buys this company they will dominate the CRM software space.  maybe google will buy them and even make the software better with deeper search integration.  what i find amazing is that i just found out about this software even though i have been in sales and marketing forever.  i talk to the hundreds of sales and marketing people in my company and they also never used it so this makes me think in 3-6 month there will be massive adoption. it is cheap compared to linkedin.  companies won\u2019t hesitate to spend thousands if they can get an advantage.  one sale covers multiple year cost of this license.", "created_utc": 1591907798.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h17gmv/zoominfo_technology/", "is_self": true}
