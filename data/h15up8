Both licences are situated in the Ashanti Gold Belt, Ghana.  \n\n\n\u2022 The asset boasts a gold recovery rate of 87.5% and an IRR of 143% (at a gold price of US$1,300).  \n\n\n\u2022 The asset boasted a Net Present Value of \u00a314.9m (at a gold price of US$1,300 per ounce) on September 2019. However, at the current gold price of $1,700, the asset boasts an NPV of \u00a319.37m.  \n\n\n\u2022 The company raised \u00a33.4 million on 16 March 2020 from sophisticated investors to finance the advancement of its Akrokeri-Homase Gold Project (AHGP) into production.  \n\n\n\u2022 The company withdrew \u00a3235,000 from its \u00a32.35m Asian Investment Management Services gold loan. Drawdown period extended to June 30, 2020 should they need the remaining \u00a32.1m.  \n\n\n\u2022 Heavy weight gold investors Paracale Gold and BCM Investments took part in the bond issue.  \n\n\n\u2022 The company confirmed, on 30 April 2020, that it was on track for gold production in H2 2020 at its AHGP asset.  \n\n\nSo, with a current market cap of \u00a311.75m (4.7pence per share), and less cash of \u00a33.5m, means the market is valuing the company\u2019s Akrokeri-Homase Gold asset at a paltry \u00a38.25m. Compare this to the asset\u2019s current value of \u00a319.37m. (Fully-funded)  \n\n\nThus, a base valuation of 12pence per share (or a \u00a329.3m market cap), that factors-in the current NPV of AHGP alongside the company\u2019s cash balances seems eminently sensible.  \n\n\nBut here\u2019s the real kicker;  \n\n\nValuing the company on a DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) model throws up significantly higher values, especially considering that the company is only a couple of months away from production; implying an extraordinary upside on the stock, and underpinned by a waning global economy that is accelerating the unfettered printing of fiat currency, and which will gradually lead to a $2,000-plus gold price.", "created_utc": 1591902805.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h15up8/wanna_sextuple_your_money_grl_goldstone_resources/", "is_self": true}
