{"id": "gk6up7", "title": "CRISPR introduction - NTLA CRSP EDIT & BEAM", "selftext": "I posted this as a reply in another thread but I think it could be usefull for those who want a 'short' introduction in the field:\n\nWhat is CRISPR, how does it work, who does what?\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAhjPd4uNFY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAhjPd4uNFY) (recommended)\n\nBasically every living organism is comprised of a DNA code that determines it's layout based on 4 'letters' (amino acids ATCG). CRISPR related tech allows you to change, alter or delete certain parts of that code with relative ease. Hopefully you can imagine the consequences of this little fact, being able to be an architect of life itself. If you can't don't worry others have already done it for you. A few years a huge battle has broken out about who owns and invented the tech, to this day.\n\nOn one side you have Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier were the first to propose that CRISPR-Cas9 (enzymes from bacteria that control microbial immunity) could be used for programmable editing of genomes, which is now considered one of the most significant discoveries in the history of biology. They are from the University of California and Vienna, which in their turn have their own subsidiaries Intellia Therapeutics (NTLA) and CRISPR therapeutics (CRSP). And on the other side you have Feng Zhang with the Broad insitute of MIT and Harvard and their subsidiaries Editas Medicine (EDIT).\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/EditasMedicine/comments/eqzjmx/crispr\\_patent\\_landscape/](https://www.reddit.com/r/EditasMedicine/comments/eqzjmx/crispr_patent_landscape/)\n\nThe patent battle is very complicated to say the least, because the tech itself is constantly evolving (ex. Base editing by Beam Therapeutics). Also legally there is a difference between using CRISPR in prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells. The first being a primitive cell used by plants and the other by complex organisms like humans and animals. So the eukaryotic patents is where the money will be for therapeutic use. But it won't be the same in every country. For example the Broad hold the patents for eukaryotic use in the US but in Europe that's contested. It's a mess keep that in mind.So at the moment you have four public traded companies who are utilizing CRISPR tech for human therapeutic uses:\n\n(They each have their own little thing going on at the moment)\n\n**Intellia Therapeutics** pipeline:\n\n[https://www.intelliatx.com/pipeline-2/](https://www.intelliatx.com/pipeline-2/)\n\nThe quiet one, the least mentioned CRISPR company bets on LNP's to be a superior delivery technique.\n\n[https://www.intelliatx.com/crisprcas9/delivery-mechanism/](https://www.intelliatx.com/crisprcas9/delivery-mechanism/)\n\nrecent good news:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/IntelliaTherapeutics/comments/gk3bux/intellia\\_therapeutics\\_reports\\_progress\\_on/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IntelliaTherapeutics/comments/gk3bux/intellia_therapeutics_reports_progress_on/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CRISPR Therapeutics** pipeline:\n\n[http://www.crisprtx.com/programs/pipeline](http://www.crisprtx.com/programs/pipeline)\n\nThe loud one, the most mentioned CRISPR company.\n\nrecent good news:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/CrisprTherapeutics/comments/gi8riq/crispr\\_therapeutics\\_and\\_vertex\\_pharmaceuticals/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrisprTherapeutics/comments/gi8riq/crispr_therapeutics_and_vertex_pharmaceuticals/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Editas Medicine** pipeline:\n\n[https://www.editasmedicine.com/gene-editing-pipeline/](https://www.editasmedicine.com/gene-editing-pipeline/)\n\nThe undervalued one, had some problems in the recent years with it's corporate officers which was reflected on the stockprice. But the tech and expertise is there imo. Also I think the Broad will win the new patent dispute and I realy like what they are trying to do with EDIT-101.\n\nrecent good news (FIRST in Vivo CRISPR use!)\n\n[https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/04/1994906/0/en/Allergan-and-Editas-Medicine-Announce-Dosing-of-First-Patient-in-Landmark-Phase-1-2-Clinical-Trial-of-CRISPR-Medicine-AGN-151587-EDIT-101-for-the-Treatment-of-LCA10.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/04/1994906/0/en/Allergan-and-Editas-Medicine-Announce-Dosing-of-First-Patient-in-Landmark-Phase-1-2-Clinical-Trial-of-CRISPR-Medicine-AGN-151587-EDIT-101-for-the-Treatment-of-LCA10.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Beam therapeutics** pipeline:\n\n[https://beamtx.com/our-portfolio/](https://beamtx.com/our-portfolio/)\n\nNew kid on the block, IPO'd this year their main approach is using base editing\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzlToB\\_0dNk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzlToB_0dNk) (recommended)\n\nIn the end which one should you buy, who holds the most promise? Who will win the patent battle? Which method is superior? I've been following the tech for 7 years and I believe all of them will be winners in the end. I can't predict who will win the patent battle, that's why I advice, if you are willing to invest in this sphere to buy all four on them. I'm heavy on EDIT and NTLA but that's just me. gl", "created_utc": 1589539643.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gk6up7/crispr_introduction_ntla_crsp_edit_beam/", "is_self": true}
