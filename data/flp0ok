This magical power comes at high tendies cost so they can keep going with their operations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor autists that stop reading here:\n\n [https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/cenovus-cuts-2020-capital-spending-plan-after-oil-collapse-1.1403179](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/cenovus-cuts-2020-capital-spending-plan-after-oil-collapse-1.1403179) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith beer flu now taking control of the world, demand is plumetting, and with Saudi Arabia pushing oil like me after eating taco Bell, the price of crude is going down.\n\nIt dosn't take a genius to look at the balance sheet of these companies to realize that they do not have enough liquidity to survive half a year of price war with oil, and the companies will absolutely need a hand out from the government. Normally, it wouldn't be a great situation but not too bad.\n\nNow with the beer flu though, a bunch of industries will need  handouts, airlines, hotels, restaurants, small businesses will need handouts also. It would be a political suicide for J. T. to handout to tar sand oil companies, while not helping save thousands of small businesses. Maybe he can find ways to make it work, but really at least half of them will have to die.\n\nI know everyone is being a gay bear with puts in the NYSE market, and thats fine, but I feel like within 3 months we will see major oil companies go belly up, and this might be a good opportunity for you autist to save the environment while making money.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want to hear other retarded opinions on this. I DD'd the balance sheet but I don't want to go through the fundamentals with people that don't even know  how options are priced.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust saying, discuss.", "created_utc": 1584679873.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flp0ok/canada_tar_sand_industry/", "is_self": true}
