Finding EPS Aint Easy.", "selftext": "I'm doing DD and keep seeing multiple EPS numbers for the same stock depending on source. \n\nI want to know the EPS and PE Ratio of the stock ffs. This is an issue for many stocks but here's an example with **$MIK** (Michael's - it's an arts and crafts store for suburban moms and it has earnings this week)\n\n[Screenshot album of the different EPS #s if you want proof](https://imgur.com/a/GFh5W0E)\n\n[**Yahoo Finance**](https://imgur.com/mnulJVX)\n\n* EPS: 2.00\n\n* PE Ratio: 2.84\n\nhmmm...relatively low. It's possible for a stock like $MIK. But I don't trust like that. \n\nBest to double check and do due diligence...NEXT\n\n[**Michael's Investor Relations website:**](https://imgur.com/hgtKSLJ)\n\n* EPS: 1.97\n\n* PE Ratio: 2.80\n\nAh shit. Now I need to triple check...\n\n[**EDGAR**](https://imgur.com/xeRpalW)\n\n* EPS:?\n\n* PE Ratio:?\n\nFuck this...I need to scroll though all these filings for the last 12 months and then calculate it myself. FML...\n\n[Hours later...

And with earnings pennies matter.**\n\n**Not only that, are these GAAP or non-GAAP earnings per share?**\n\n**No wonder the market is irrational.**", "created_utc": 1567475531, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cyyf9e/pimping_is_easy_finding_eps_aint_easy/", "is_self": true}
