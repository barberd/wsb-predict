{"id": "gi07to", "title": "Playing Earnings for Scrubs", "selftext": "Hey kids, do you like Primus? Do you want to see me stick nine inch nails through each one of my eyelids?\n\nWait, sorry, wrong sub.\n\nAre you fairly new to options? Did you just start trading at the bottom of the crash a month ago because the FOMO was strong as fuck after the retards here got rich then lost it all on the drop and recovery?\n\nYeah, me too.\n\nYou've probably seen quite a bit about trading earnings. You may have even tried it yourself only to get absolutely dick smashed by IV crush.\n\nThere is a way to get in on the earnings action without all the pain, and since theta gang is the devil, we aren't paying those fucks all of our tendies to get into the trade a week or two out before the IV spikes.\n\nSay we want to bet on TTWO (Take Two Interactive) smashing their earnings call on the 20th because gamers have been cooped up at home doing nothing but fapping, gaming, and more fapping for months now.\n\nTTWO is trading at $132.59 a share right now. We could go pay $590 for a 5/22 $133 call. If the stock trades flat from now to earnings most of that $590 goes to theta fags. We could do it anyway since the IV is relatively low right now and we watch our position bleed out and then see the IV spike just before earnings hopefully bringing us back to even. Or we could wait until just before earnings when IV is through the roof and pay a bloody fortune for a short term option, although then we can be right but have the stock not move far enough and get IV crushed. Both of these are what theta gangsters want you to do.\n\nInstead I give you the Robinhood special, 4-Option Order. There's probably a real technical name for it, but I'm a fucking idiot and this is what it shows up as when you put it in Robinhood.\n\nWe buy the same 5/22 $133c, then sell a 5/22 $134c. We also sell a 5/22 $130p, and buy a 5/22 $129p.\n\nThis capped our gains and our losses, but it also made us theta neutral. We lose zero tendies per day for holding this bitch waiting for the 20th. In fact if the stock trades flat all the way to expiration we make a few bucks. Entering the trade will credit us with $5, and tie up $95 of our buying power. If the stock hits $134 or higher on the 22nd we make $105. If it hits $129 or lower we lose $95.\n\nPotential return looks like this: http://opcalc.com/7Hl\n\nYou can do a similar trade the other way by selling a slightly OTM call backstopped with a slightly higher one, and buying an atm put and selling a slightly otm one to take a theta neutral bearish position.\n\nI know the capped gains and losses thing is kind of a drag, but there's no free lunch. I would also point out that you can jump into a trade like this the day of or day before earnings. Our buys and sells offset each other so the wicked high IV doesn't fuck us. We just have to get the direction of movement right, and we need much smaller movements to win our bet.\n\nAnyway, enjoy, and stop buying shitty way out of the money positions because it's all your broke ass can afford. Start doing spreads, and whatnot and win a few of your bets for a change.\n\nCheers fuckers.", "created_utc": 1589243466.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gi07to/playing_earnings_for_scrubs/", "is_self": true}
