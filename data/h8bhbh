I currently own 68 contracts for now out of money, near worthless SPG calls that expire on Friday.\n\ncontracts are between **85c to 100c** expiring 6/19 and SPG currently sits  **$75.80** so... I mean its possible that I am either rich as fuck by Friday or eating ice meals and taking naps for lunch. If they sputter or pull back and dont move cause of VIX I will have successfully blown 58k in calls in 1 week. Beat that nerds. Will update the losses at end of week. Godspeed autists\n\nTotal spent **$20492**\n\nMax Value: **$52500 (Jun. 8)**\n\nCurrent value: **$3174**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/xoqphJz](https://imgur.com/a/xoqphJz)\n\nLesson to be learned here folks. Get your hand out the damn cookie jar cause shit goes south quick.  Don't stop to take selfies with your +3000% gainer by saying it can still go up and when the market takes $15k from you at the opening bell, dont let them take the rest by trying to get more calls for cheap to average down.\n\nI bought almost all of these contracts between 80c-100c when SPG was bouncing between 84 and 91 the day of and before the drop.  I bought no Put protections to hedge against the loss either, because why do the sensible thing when you can just keep buying calls cause stonks only something\n\n&#x200B;\n\n$12k to 59k to $10k in the journey.\n\nBonus Gallery of what they were worth the night before the drop here: [https://imgur.com/a/1ZqDylo](https://imgur.com/a/1ZqDylo)", "created_utc": 1592068474.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h8bhbh/you_could_say_i_got_caught_with_my_pants_down/", "is_self": true}
