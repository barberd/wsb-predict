I've been thinking about this all day, here's what i think it comes down to:\n\nfirst this isn't a winner take all market, there are different sectors and demos and FB will probably cater to a specific one. i'm guessing more of a traditional MF relationship 30+ demo, which would make it a match.com / PoF / okcupid competitor, but we have yet to see. for the free user there's no real harm in having multiple profiles.next is the revenue piece. no word on this costing anything. FB has the advantage of being able to monetize without charging the users. so the question is, will FB dating cause match (mostly tinder) subscribers to unsub? if the demo isn't the same, then i think the answer is not significantly. primary source of revenue is male tinder subscribers, so taking all of this into account there are two important questions:\n\n1. **will female tinder users leave in favor of FB?**\n2. **will male tinder subscribers unsubscribe in favor of FB?**\n\ni believe 2 would follow 1, but 1 doesn't necessarily follow 2. so then, if the answer to either of these questions is YES (in significant numbers) then we can't long MTCH as this will begin to hurt their bottom line. **some notes**\n\n1. FB is only launching in the US, with a promise to launch in europe at a later time\n2. the biggest threat to MTCH is a free FB dating product that female tinder users prefer, leaving no reason for men to subscribe\n3. ongoing international growth in MTCH could help even all this out if the unsubs aren't too large\n4. continued investment in new properties or properties outside FB demo could also help\n\n**final thoughts**\n\n* MTCH is the current undisputed leader in the space, but upstarts like Bumble are already encroaching on their territory. FB launch makes this a bigger risk.\n* I still believe Zuck to be a robot incapable of delivering a product that attracts significant usage. Has has tried and failed at this before, but not in the US.\n* Along with the IAC spinoff, holding MTCH will be a bumpy ride for the next few months. But it could also create a delicious buying opportunity. I am currently not invested but will be watching very closely.", "created_utc": 1567718815, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d0748j/fb_dating_and_what_it_means_for_match_mtch_wsb/", "is_self": true}
