Like $WORK or $ZM they both were moving in the direction the day of results.  Where the fuck can I get earnings results ahead of time because the investors tab on the companies websites are shit and you have to listen to a conference call to find out the earnings. Like the dude on cnbc had the results in his hand the second the bell closed wtf how if it was supposed to be released an hour after close at earliest", "created_utc": 1591339694.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gwzhq8/snitches_get_stitches/", "is_self": true}
