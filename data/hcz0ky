{"id": "hcz0ky", "title": "Cannabis Farm Opportunity", "selftext": "So this may or may not be allowed, but I'll give it a shot. As you know, there isn't any way to invest in Cannabis in the US through stocks because the SEC is federal and Cannabis is federally illegal. So the only way to really get in on the industry in it's infancy is through direct investment. This isn't a scam, pump and dump, or anything like that. Everything here is verifiable through public records. \n\n5 years ago I YOLO'd my life savings ($274) by applying for a cannabis farm license. Myself and 1200 other people got approved. I used my mom's 5 acre farm and her capital to build it. What ensued was a race to the bottom because of oversupply and a crappy producer-processor-retailer model like alcohol has. I was able to hang in there long enough for about 30% of all the other farms to go out of business by keeping costs low and doing most of the work myself. After 3 years of making slightly more than enough to break even and add little improvements, my father died and my sisters looted my inheritance which resulted in a big fight and me kicking them to the curb. My narcissistic mother decided to disown me and sell the pot farm while I was on vacation. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I returned and learned of all this, I got the half of the business she promised me in return for my sweat equity and she sold her half to a pathological narcissist boomer pothead that hates autistic people. After he nearly ran the business into the ground during his first year, we managed to hustle some loans to bring it back and make $7k/ea for that year. Finally in the 4th year, the price of cannabis quadrupled due to a shortage and we made $130k/ea. This was when he decided to make his play while I was on vacation. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter I returned from vacation, I learned that he had usurped a business opportunity to buy my mom's farm and then proceeded to kick me out and self-deal by charging the business $20k/month rent for what amounts to a half acre of pasture(a $100/yr value). So now we're both lawyered up and he refused my $500k offer to buy him out over 5 yrs and I refused his $100k offer to buy me out and he is suing to have the partnership dissolved, which is what most likely will happen and cost us each $40k in legal fees. What a nice guy, eh?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, there are 3 opportunity options here:\n\n1. One(or many) of you smart autists on here pony up $200k this year for his half and then make $100k payments each year for 3 more years for his half. We'd be able to move the business to a less restrictive zone and double production so you'd be making wild profits of like $260k/yr less the $100k payments and recoup your investment in < 2 yrs and be set with $260k/yr for life. Then when federal legalization comes along you could sell your half for $5million or whatever to Phillip Morris or Canopy Growth or whoever. Maybe even IPO or merge into a SPAC.\n2. We can wait for it to go up for auction and I can throw in $130k(it's all I'll have after legal fees) to buy it and find someone else to pony up the rest. I don't know what it will fetch at auction but it is literally impossible to buy a license right now for a Tier 3(the largest allowed) producer/processor so it could be a big risk. The upside here is that I would get half of the auction money so if it goes for $500k I'd have $250k to throw right back into the deal to make it a 50/50 thing and have enough money to relocate it. \n3. You can buy it at auction and have a go at farming and I walk away with my sale money and go day trade in Bali. I'd much rather have $260k/yr for life.\n\nAnyway, just an opportunity coming up soon. If you'd like more details you can PM me or reply in comments. We have a CPA doing all our books so all the financials are sound. Last year sales were around $500k. Anybody holding a large interest in a cannabis company has to go through a background check to see if they had convictions for felonies or black market weed dealings. It's not that restrictive but rather based on points and how long ago it was.", "created_utc": 1592706483.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hcz0ky/cannabis_farm_opportunity/", "is_self": true}
