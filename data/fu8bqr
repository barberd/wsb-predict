This is what my everyday morning looks like.\n\nThis is my last one for the week bc I don't want you guys to get sick of seeing my art lol, as u/1RONYMAN once famously said in 1780BC: \" Supply and Demand creatith tendies, my child.\"\n\nPlease leave reguhmendations for more art and PM me if you want a custom piece. I'm also gonna find some art-style charity for kids and donate there in a few weeks. Happy Friday Autists, here's to another day of all the wrong moves.\n\nEnjoy this one.
