Anyway, the expired option was sitting in my account yesterday and I thought there's no way in hell they will exercise the option so I let it go. \n\nThis morning I woke up with a shit ton of money in my account and -100 SPY shares  in my account. I quickly covered my position during the day so it wasn't all a disaster. \n\nIn hope you retards don't repeat the same mistake I did.", "created_utc": 1584565342.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkx47v/warning_for_retards_in_the_money_expired_options/", "is_self": true}
