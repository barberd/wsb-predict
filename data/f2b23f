{"id": "f2b23f", "title": "Bond Market Telling a Different Story: Armageddon DD Inside", "selftext": "The bond market and stock market are often proxies for useful comparison. Historically, they could be viewed as contrasting financial products. Jump into the safety of treasuries when shit hits the fan. Jump into stonks when shit does not hit the fan. \n\nThis logic since the financial crisis has been negligent, as due to Fed policy (including ZIRP and QE) rates have been artificially held low. We know this. Cool.\n\nNow when you do an overlay comparison between the 10Y Treasury and SPY for the past decade, a significant plunge in rates preceded every significant SPY pullback with the exception of the Vol explosion in Feb 2018. \n\nHowever, on a 20 year (weekly) comparison, since the Vol explosion and trade war related volatility in Feb 2018, rates and stonks have been on the most significant divergence of the past decade.\n\nMoreso, on a 5 year (daily) comparison of the 10 Year Treasury and SPY, since late May / early June 2019 when Fed talk of rate cuts really escalated, the divergence in the relationship has been the strongest. \n\n**What does this mean?**\n\nTreasuries are having record inflows (in part due to Fed policy, foreign sovereign debt yields at negative yields, corona, etc.) while simultaneously stonks are hitting all time highs. Historically, such significant divergences are followed by mean reversion (in this case a short term return to a relatively symmetric relationship). The question becomes, which side is right and which is wrong? \n\nIs the bond market reasonably pricing in fear or are stonks worthy of all time highs?\n\n**tl:dr: Bond market and stock market are sending different signals. Bond market showing fear, stonk market showing optimism. Is this the final crusade for the bears to officially rise up?**\n\nDiscuss and if the consensus is I am not autistic, I will evaluate SPY put plays.", "created_utc": 1581439815, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f2b23f/bond_market_telling_a_different_story_armageddon/", "is_self": true}
