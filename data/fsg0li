I still think there is another leg down, short term volatility cannot be predicted, I am not buying anything for a long term hold today. This is just a perspective on the mid to long term. \n\nAbbott Laboratories got emergency permission from the FDA to produce their COVID-19 test that produces a positive in as little as 5 minutes, negative in 13. They are going to produce 5 million tests in April: https://www.abbott.com/corpnewsroom/product-and-innovation/detect-covid-19-in-as-little-as-5-minutes.html\n\n\nThis has implications FAR beyond the immediate benefit in flattening the curve and saving front-line healthcare workers, BOTH OF WHICH IT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO SIGNIFICANTLY. The 5 million tests being produced are basically fancy swabs to put into a machine, as described, about the size of a toaster. \n\n\nThis medical toaster. Fancy medical machinery, must be expensive, right? Is $10,040 expensive? https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/alere-i-influenza-a-b-alere-i-instrument/23046617\n\n\nIt may be for your broke ass. Is $10,040 expensive for your local Walmart store, to test all their employees before their shift starts in the flu season? \n\nDo American parents think $10,040 is too big of a one-time cost for little Susie's elementary school to test the teachers likewise? \n\nIs $10,040 too expensive for Disney to put one in EVERY SINGLE EMPLOYEES-ONLY AREA AT DISNEY WORLD? \n\n\nThey will obviously get FDA approval, if not the model as-is, they will revise it. I am speculating that production at massive scale will make swab costs negligible in the long term. Larger players and metro areas will have the cash to buy in sooner. \n\n\nBy Fall life is back to normal with some adjustments, economy back to normal, if it isn't already. As I write this out I'm not actually sure we've even going to have another big leg down at all. (Until the consequences of infinite money come about, which could be 3 months to never)\n\n\nTL;DL: By 2021 you will be subject to forced rectal swabs by both government and private parties at will, but SPY is at 400 and grandma is probably still alive.\n\n\nEDIT: I would love to hear the a bearish take on this. My own further research:\n\n-Flu A/B tests cost about $100 each: https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/alere-i-flu-a-b-2-mod-24t-pk/23046634\n\n-Strep A/B tests are about $77 each: https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/alere-i-strep-a-2-test-kit/23046632\n\n-RSV test kits are $90 each: https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/alere-i-rsv-test-kit-24-pk/23043632\n\n-They also sell \"control swabs\" at approx. $20 each that are sold in pack of 24; I assume these are consumable as well. \n\n\nSo a flu test is $120 inclusive, today. I don't know how much flu testing is being done. Unknown factors then are the starting price of the COVID-19 test module, whether this demand for non-medical testing I'm predicting will materialize, and how low the cost per test can go. Government could use some of that infinite money to subsidize private enterprise use of mass testing too.", "created_utc": 1585672095.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fsg0li/abbotts_5minute_covid19_test_is_massively/", "is_self": true}
