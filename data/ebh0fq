But strangles seem to be working great, every time I put one one, it is a winner. If the UL stays between the strikes then I\u2019m green on both sides. If the UL moves outside of a strike, the untested side gains more than the tested side loses. \n\nSo my question is, what is the catch? I\u2019m selling high IV &amp; 35-45ish DTE strangles.  What is the down side risk that I haven\u2019t seen yet?", "created_utc": 1576512306, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ebh0fq/selling_strangleswhats_the_catch/", "is_self": true}
