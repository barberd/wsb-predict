{"id": "fykcf1", "title": "Going Short Is Now American.", "selftext": "Your name is Hugo. You're an Ukrainian immigrant who moved to USA in 1969. Your mother is a nurse. Your father is an engineer. Smart parents, but still grew up poor because it works better for the story. \n\n\nYou graduate college with an engineering degree like your Dad. You get a good job in the Midwest making slightly over 50K. Over the years you put in over 50 hour weeks and move up the ranks. You're almost making 100K a year. \n\n\nFast forward to 2020. You've been working hard the past few years. Meanwhile executives at an airline corporation have been jacked to the tits on cocaine. They've been putting in 50 hour weeks on their yacht. They don't have to work very hard because all they have to do is buyback their own stock. \n\n\nA fisherman pulls up beside the yacht in a dingy. He yells \"I noticed you announced a 10 billion stock buyback program, yet you are selling personal holdings of the company stock. It doesn't make any sense.\" \n\n\nThe executives laugh, and whip out their dicks so they can piss on the fisherman. \n\n\nThe executives come back to shore from a 25 day cocaine binge. A virus has spread. They all rush back to the office. Their planes are literally flying with 5 passengers per flight. They all of a sudden have no more cash to keep the corporation afloat. They spent all the cash on buybacks. What are they going to do? \n\n\nThey pull out a top secret envelope. It's a list of middle class workers. Hugo is third on the list. An executive says \"Pick Hugo, he sounds like a poor person\". Hugo's tax dollars just got selected to fund the airline bailout. The executives continue to scroll down the list. They have 50 million more Americans to choose.", "created_utc": 1586539880.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fykcf1/going_short_is_now_american/", "is_self": true}
