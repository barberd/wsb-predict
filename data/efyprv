Here it is 11 days later and no update... yea its the holidays so not too furious but need to get my \"game\" on.  Cant sign on chat server which is the first options as evidently the demand has it crashed or India's internet is down.  I have to call and over 30 min wait so I have them call me back.  They call me back and shipping me another monitor.  Maybe I can get 2 now but I doubt it.  \n\nThe rub.... Costco online very busy so they must have sold a lot of shit.  UPS didnt hire enough temps to maintain minimum service over holidays.  Thank goodness I am a selfish bastard and this wasnt gifts for needy snot blowers or I would be Uncle Scrooge.", "created_utc": 1577383811, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/efyprv/long_costco_short_ups/", "is_self": true}
