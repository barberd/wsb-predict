{"id": "h0uxwy", "title": "WallStreetBets Podcast Idea", "selftext": "Hey friends, sorry for the repost. Just wanna get as much input as I can and last night was too focused on the impending death of all bulls, not that today will be much better.\n\nAnyways, I present to you \u201cWallStreetBets: Go Big or Go Home\u201d (yeah, name is shit. I\u2019d love your input and suggestions).\n\nI\u2019ve been on the sub a little while now and would love to hear from these individuals who bet their entire life savings and their lives are changed in a day. But, of course, I\u2019d also love to hear from the people who lost it all, but won\u2019t stop \u2018til they make that shit back. And from this idea, we\u2019ve arrived here.\n\nI would love to begin making a weekly podcast (released Saturdays? most likely) where I invite on some of the biggest winners (fuck WSBGod) and the biggest losers of the past week and hear about their trades, where they got the idea, what the hell they\u2019re gonna do with their tendies, or how they\u2019re gonna tell their wives they\u2019ll be sleeping in a car.\n\nI don\u2019t know about you, but I used to love weekends. And now, I watch the Weekend Dow for 48 hours straight listening to my own thoughts and reading the weekend thread. Now, we can all listen to others talk about their fortune and misery, fun!\n\nI\u2019d love to hear input on some names, ways to take the show, what else to include, and anything else you\u2019d like to say.\n\nThanks for reading (and hopefully listening) and I\u2019ll work on getting this figured out as quickly as I can. Maybe it\u2019ll be a shitshow, but I might as well try.\n\nVote if you\u2019d like: [https://strawpoll.com/8xswehf9](https://strawpoll.com/8xswehf9)\n\nThanks autists,\n\nMGM 25c 6/12, fuck", "created_utc": 1591862768.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h0uxwy/wallstreetbets_podcast_idea/", "is_self": true}
