DD: First friend in the group to figure out Costco vodka was generic grey goose.  \n\nSays he\u2019s keeping lots of money stockpiled depression-style in an apartment after losing $600 in the bank to \u201ctrade talks going to hell\u201d. \n\nWe\u2019re sitting here whining about yield inversion curves and shit, this dude just became the first Cash Gang casualty ive ever seen\n\nCan relay the following intel:\n\n~Gyna is geared to fuck us.  Their corporations gladly taking losses to essentially aid the overthrow of the US (FDs, essentially). \n[*note: Communism may be an effective way of combating the Republican Party. More on that later]. \n\n~is in fact allowed to talk about H___g K__g. Says it\u2019s a non-issue in everyday life compared to the trade war. \n\n~Said he is considering moving home and timing the condo market, which IMO is the investment profile of a scared man. \n\nMore to come.
