For me, just intraday because I can't get away from the feeling the market will tank hard one of these days after hours.  Which brings me to this little gem:  despite all the talk about earnings being priced in, JPM and WF release earnings today, and tank between 2-5%, on a day market went up 3%, for a delta of 5-8% decline.\n\nYet somehow, BAC who releases earnings tomorrow, and is already red today, have cheap puts.  I'm talking I bought 1 dollar out of the money puts for 5/8, for 1.50 a contract today.   Whatever you may believe, hard to not see value there.\n\nI think banks will also be one of the first dominos to fall, as they are exposed to all the debt default, and these earnings reports will be the first reality check for how fucked the market is.\n\nAm I crazy for buying these?  What am I missing?  A month ago, puts like this would have been 3-4 bucks...", "created_utc": 1586895315.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1cznw/bank_earnings_dd/", "is_self": true}
