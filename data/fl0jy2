I'm sitting at $3,200 up from my first option I purchased $925. It's not much, but its an honest living.\n\nIf tomorrow starts to drop hard early-mid day I'll sell my calls and rebuy them at the bottom of the day to prep for Friday. \n\nFriday orgasm all day, pivot on the drop reinvest all gains in SPY puts for next week.", "created_utc": 1584577985.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fl0jy2/you_made_me/", "is_self": true}
