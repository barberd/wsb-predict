Walking my dog today I hear a lot of fireworks... of course 4th of July eh. About 20 mins into my walk a big ass thunder happened. This thunder produced a sound over 120db to be specific. Think of a Metallica concert compressed into 2 seconds. Light show and all. \n\nYou might be wonder... whats the point? Well fellas. I can't expose where I live... but lets say Lockheed Martin has operations nearby. This thunder wasn't normal. After this thunder... I did not hear any more fireworks for another 10 mins or so... Fundamentals told me that people were impressed. Fundamentals also tell me to short fireworks... but of course we are here to make money. I am sure Lockheed had something to do with this particular thunder. \n\nAfter this... concensio, contango and macarena all tell me to go long on Lockheed Martin.", "created_utc": 1562309555, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c9cu09/long_lockheed_martin_dd/", "is_self": true}
