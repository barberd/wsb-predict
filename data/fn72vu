There is currently next to no testing be done. In some parts of India, the population density is 10x what it is in New York, and we all know how fucked Ol\u2019 York is. I\u2019m an engineering student at UW and as such I have the pleasure of knowing a shit ton of Indians and nearly all of them are boasting about their \u201cinvincible immune systems.\u201d India is setting itself up for a shit storm. Let\u2019s discuss what companies and indexes we think will take a big hit and how to make some tendies off this. \n\nMy positions: None, I recently pulled out all of my puts and sold any of the remaining stocks I still foolishly had. \n\nTLDR: Buy puts on India\n\nEDIT 1: For those claiming that since China was able to fight off the virus so will India, I would like to remind you that India will not have the balls to forcibly nail peoples apartment doors shut like China did. China is an authoritarian regime and as such was able to employ drastic measures to stop the spread of the virus.", "created_utc": 1584910664.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fn72vu/india_is_going_to_get_hit_hard/", "is_self": true}
