I'll jump right into it:\n\nI read over and over from many different sources that the vast majority of people (and CERTAINLY beginners) would do best to simply invest everything in the S&amp;P 500 and wait as long as possible instead of investing in individual stocks and trying to \"time the market\". But, well, to be honest, I have doubts about this advice... last year, the S&amp;P 500 had a return of about 35%... looking at a few stocks that are majorly popular and recommended by financial advisers (like Microsoft, AMD, Roku, Apple, Shopify, Mastercard, and so many others, you can literally just google \"best stocks\" to find them), their 2019 performance looks amazing! They had returns that absolutely crushed the S&amp;P 500's 35%! Most of them were over 100%... Investing in any one of those single stocks ALONE would have yielded substantially higher returns than the S&amp;P 500.\n\nHere's my question: is me doubting this advice (that its best for noobs to invest in S&amp;P 500 rather than individual stocks) coming from a place of naivety? Is it actually in reality a LOT harder to \"beat the market\" then I think it is? Is what I am doing right now (cherry picking individual stocks that had great performance last year and then expecting they'll have great performance next year) a recipe for disaster? Would I do best to simply invest everything in the S&amp;P 500 like everyone is saying, even though I feel like I can do so much better with those few stocks mentioned above?\n\nThanks for any insight!", "created_utc": 1577149835, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eetsgo/ready_to_invest_in_the_stock_market_for_the_first/", "is_self": true}
