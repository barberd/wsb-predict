I pray thee, wish not one man more.\nBy\u00a0Papa Elon, I am not covetous for $GLD,\nNor care I who doth feed upon my $DIX;\nIt yearns me not if my tendies print;\nSuch outward things dwell not in my desires.\n\nBut if it be a sin to covet tendies,\nI am the most offending soul alive.\nNo, faith, my\u00a0cause wish not a man from r/WallStreetBets.\n\nu/separate-variation peace! I would not lose so great tendies. As one man more methinks would share from me. For the best hope I have. O, do not wish one more!\n\nRather proclaim it, u/variation-separate, through my host, that he which hath no stomach to this fight,\nLet him depart; his passport shall be made,\u00a0\nAnd crowns for convoy put into his purse;\nWe would not die in that man's company\nThat fears his fellowship to die with us.\n\nThis day is call'd the feast of\u00a0Tendies.\nHe that outlives this day, and comes safe home,\nWill stand a tip-toe when this day is nam'd,\n\nAnd rouse him at the name of Tendies.\nHe that shall live this day, and see old age,\nWill yearly on the vigil feast his Puts,\nAnd say \"To-morrow is Tendies.\"\n\nThen will he strip his sleeve and show his scars,\nAnd say \"These wounds I had at Bull Trap.\"\n\nBoomers forget; yet all shall be forgot,\nBut S-V remember, with advantages,\nWhat feats he did that day.
