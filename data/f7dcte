That kind of transition can be an inflection point that justifies a strong share price gain, just as we have seen here.\"\n\nEtsy is definitely a Becky store. But Becky's sure do love it. They\u2019ve had positive eps in their last four quarters.\n\nIn my opinion, Etsy is a company that artsy Becky's love. To all you out degenerates out there that has experienced a relationship, I am sure a good portion of your women has purchased something off of Etsy.\n\nAnyway, their earnings call is 2/26 on after hours. Highly recommend purchasing some calls before their report. Especially now while they are still affordable. \n\nAnd with your gains, buy some moon stickers off Etsy while you\u2019re at it.\n\ntldr; Etsy is like the Becky equivalent of amazon, buy-in it now while it's low. Make some calls for the quarterly report.", "created_utc": 1582301688, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7dcte/real_dd_on_etsy_with_tldr/", "is_self": true}
