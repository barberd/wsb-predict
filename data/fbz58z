This level of the WSB video game was a lot of fun.  I think we hit the mini boss stage!\n\nI entered new leveraged SP500 positions in SSO and UPRO (posted below for proof) but what is the plan for Monday?\n\nIf at the start of trading we see a move down I will be going LONG (probably BRKB and SPY for a family portfolio looking for value and SSO or UPRO for me).  This will probably by FOMO shorts who saw the action last week and want to get in on it (but are likely late).  Such price action could also be driven by the weekend news if that was not already priced in.\n\nIf we BOUNCE up I am waiting it out and entering longs (same trades) but closer the end of business.  Margin calls will happen in the mid afternoon as well but I am not buying into the bounce... I will wait for it to come to me.\n\nOverall there is so much negativity ANY good news will bounce us up HARD so going short is starting to look riskier and riskier.\n\nNext week will definitely be an epic boss battle.\n\nAny other plans to share?\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/84V5bQS](https://imgur.com/a/84V5bQS)\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/ZFBmSrw](https://imgur.com/a/ZFBmSrw)", "created_utc": 1583090864, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fbz58z/trading_plans_for_next_week_we_have_reached_the/", "is_self": true}
