{"id": "f4krwm", "title": "Thousand Dollar Yolo", "selftext": "I found out about Robinhood instant deposits on February 11.\n\nMy RH is linked to an old bank account that has been closed and I had trouble linking my new paycard. While waiting I just couldn't miss out on sweet sweet tendies I had heard about on WSB. \n\nFriday they took the 1000$ out and after all plays I'm sitting at +221.36 whilst still holding some calls. They deduct the 1000 from my buying power so I still have some liquidation to do before I make any more plays Monday. Plan to sell all and buy any SPCE call I can get Tuesday with &lt;200$.\n\nI started with less than 5$ of my real money years ago and just held cheap penny stocks. All of my actual gains were from this thousand dollar YOLO.\n\nSpecial thanks to FB+SPCE calls and LYFT puts\n\nMy goal is to reach $1000 from an initial investment of less than 10$.\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nI yolo'd 1000$ I didn't have from RH instant deposit and it didn't blow up in my face. I have a gambling problem now.", "created_utc": 1581823579, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f4krwm/thousand_dollar_yolo/", "is_self": true}
