But just because you are smart doesn't make you money. Let me explain...\n\nAccording to Gallup (link here) about 55% of Americans own stocks/ETF's, which is around half the population (170 Million People).\n\n [https://news.gallup.com/poll/266807/percentage-americans-owns-stock.aspx](https://news.gallup.com/poll/266807/percentage-americans-owns-stock.aspx) \n\nOK, so what? So...\n\nI have been digging around google a bit, and I didn't find an exact figure but according to various articles and estimates there are about 5 - 10 Million active day/swing traders in the U.S. each day. Lets just call it 10 million.\n\nSo here's us, all 10 Million of us and we have a plan. Any LOGICAL person would agree when looking at this market that it HAS to do X - Y or Z, right? I mean we look at the market all day we know what we're doing. WRONG! Those other 160 million people that listen to the media, politicians and what their brokers say will FUCKING CRUSH YOU and there is a good reason. Volume.\n\nYea, there are some \"lucky\" people on WSB, that's a fact. But 95% of us lose. But you don't have to...\n\n**Stop trying to be so damn smart**. Listen, these people are sheep, OK? They are sheep. They run in any direction they are told to and they run together, just like the Bulls. Bears are solitary creatures for good reason. Nothing is LOGICAL about this and it never will be. I have tried to convince myself time and time again that \"this can't be real\", \"that's impossible\". Well wake up Lucy, it's fucking real. \n\nThis whole system is BIAS and the MM's that run it would rather WATCH PEOPLE DIE than let this market fall. Yea it falls a little bit here and there, and looking at past charts and graphs you would think that A - B - C would happen but its fucking 2020. The markets have learned from past mistakes, politicians and MM's are more cunning, there are algorithms and new laws. \n\nThe shit is rigged and it's more rigged now than it has ever been, as obvious as that may seem. \n\nI want everyone to make tendies, but most of us won't. Because to be honest this post probably wont be taken seriously and I understand. It's not fun to be a sheep. There's no thrill. Like why even do it if you're not taking a risk. I get it. I lost 10K this month. That might not be as much as some people but it still hurts. I'ts a ten thousand dollar lesson I had to learn. But **YOU** don't have to.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9otd1jlm6bt41.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4fb289197e68624fe1f1e99eac4d50005bda922\n\nI still don't think we hit bottom, but I know a lot of us Bears are discouraged. All I can say is the next time it dips, if it does, seize the opportunity, don't get greedy and **FOLLOW THE SHEEP**.\n\nIf you wanna be a Bear, I get it. If you are a Bull, I can see why. There is no right or wrong. Don't get caught up in what SHOULD happen, or why \"this shit is fucked up\". **You don't have to make sense, you just have to make money.** You guys got this. I believe in all of us. I really see a lot of potential here in WSB. Anyway you guys I appreciate you a lot, I've been on this sub for a short time but I have learned so much. I thank anyone that took their time to read this.
