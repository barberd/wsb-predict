{"id": "cev6al", "title": "Can someone lay out the bull case for NFLX?", "selftext": "Disclaimer: I own no position in Netflix currently but held a short position over earnings that was obviously profitable. \n\nI don\u2019t understand the bull case here. Its P/E is over 100, which I understand can be justified by 1) the fact that most revenue is being reinvested in the company for future growth (see AMD) or 2) there is an anticipated huge amount of growth in the future. Usually it\u2019s a combination of both. \n\nWith Netflix, do we have either? It seems that Netflix has such a high spending budget because it invests in original content and licenses other shows. But unlike companies that invest in infrastructure and equipment, if Netflix wants to stay relevant, it must continue to do these things. It would be decades before Netflix has enough original content to get rid of the other stuff, and I\u2019m not convinced it would be as popular without it.\n\nIn addition, do we really see massive growth from here? It seems that most people who want Netflix have Netflix, hence the drop in domestic growth, and that it just doesn\u2019t have the same appeal internationally (hence the disappointing numbers). If you travel, you know that nobody consumes streaming TV like Americans. We will never see comparable adoption abroad. \n\nSo, I ask, why is this stock so expensive?
