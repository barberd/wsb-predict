Im still addicted to the yolos, im thinking about shorting NVIDIA at their upcoming earnings, their current stock price is higher than a news article about a price evaluation from a german company or some shit #autistforlife which said It was a boost from 160 to 190, so will it correct down after earnings? Shall I yolo or nah, just wait till a more certain yolo. It said it was a boost, but its still higher.
