{"id": "fqds6r", "title": "Corona stimulus bill key detail", "selftext": "As I'm sure you know by now, the Senate passed a 2 trillion dollar Corona relief bill this week. If you're at all curious where that money goes, here's the basic breakdown of it:\n1) 560 billion to individuals via cash payment or unemployment benefits \n2) 500 billion in big corporate loans*(we'll get back to this)\n3) 377 billion to small businesses loans\n4) 340 billion to state and local governments\n5) 153 billion for public health\n\nFor the most part, this is pretty straightforward. The catch comes when you start looking at the fine text of the big corporate loans. Of the 500 billion, 75 billion will go straight to airlines. The other 425 billion helps capitalize a $4.25 trillion, with a T, leveraged lending facility at the Federal Reserve. The taxpayer dollars would soak up any losses from that lending program.\u00a0You read that correctly. The Federal Reserve will leverage that freshly printed cash at a 10:1 ratio. It gets worse. So much worse. The only legislated restrictions on companies that take these loans is a temporary ban on stock buybacks. Besides that, they can pretty much do what they want. They're not even held to the same standards small businesses will be of retaining employees on payroll. The government will get no equity in these companies. The money can be used for increased executive compensation, mergers, wholesale purchases of smaller businesses, etc. This bill blows the 2008 700 billion dollar corporate bailout out of the water. So yeah, I guess my DD from reading this is to invest heavily in big time blue chipper once you see us start to recover. The playing field has shifted even more dramatically in their favor. \n\nTLDR: 500 billion in big buisness loans is actually $4 trillion. Gonna be a feast for the big boys\n\nSource: https://www.google.com/amp/s/prospect.org/api/amp/coronavirus/unsanitized-bailouts-tradition-unlike-any-other/", "created_utc": 1585371787.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqds6r/corona_stimulus_bill_key_detail/", "is_self": true}
