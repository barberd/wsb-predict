Listed below are companies and their 3 month losses and 1 year losses.\n\n\nAll listed are red\nFood/Restaurants\nGRUB -12% / -50\u2013%\nYUM -22%/ -20%\nMCD -10% / -2.74%\nSBUX -22%/ -0.84%\nQSR -31% / -27%\n\nHotels\nHLT -27% / -6.96%\nMAR -34% / 19.3%\n\nVegas or Arena \nMSG (Madison was Garden) -21%/ 25%\nLVS -29% / 18.5%\nMGm -53% / -42.7%\n\nAmusement \nDIS -12.9% / 11%\nSIX -31% / 69%\n\nShops\nNKE -23% / 12%\nFL (foot locker) -38%/ -61%\n\nAirline/travel\nBA -50% / -56%\nLUV -25%/ -19.8%\nBKNG -28%/ -19.6%\nTCOM -26% / -39%\n\nBanks - more rate cuts/ oil exposure \nBAC -33% /-20%\nJPM -27% / -3.8%\nC -35% / -21%\nWFC -43% / -39%\nHSBC -24% / -27%\n\nTemp staffing (cant see companies hiring temps staff) \nAPECCO -37% / -24%\nRHI -24% / -27% \n\n\nMCD, SBUX, HLT, LVS, DIS, NKE, JPM, HSBC, RHI all seem attractive given they have not pulled back as much over the past year or over past month.
