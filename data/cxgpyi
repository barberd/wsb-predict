Shs shorted rose by +317k shs,+5.77%, over the last month as its stock price slid -28%, and rose, +66k,+1.15%, over the last week. Shorts are down -$699 mm in YTD mark-to-market losses\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the first time since the secondary offering after earnings, IB has 0 shares to lend out (as of yesterday afternoon when I checked), which is a good sign. The rise in the BYND stock price has basically mirrored the short borrow rate. As there are no more shares to lend out, the short borrow rate SHOULD rise as demand to short the stock increases. Short borrow costs bottomed out at roughly 50% in mid August. I have been buying up some calls with strikes in the $220-$250 range with expirations in the September - November time frame. Not a YOLO, since the momentum totally broke down, but [I am taking the calculated risk that this short squeeze might happen again.](https://giphy.com/gifs/XdOeeJ6BjyTB22iR1P) Please remember that the lockup expires end of October.", "created_utc": 1567170644, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cxgpyi/bynd_short_borrow_rates_and_short_interest/", "is_self": true}
