I'm here to tell you how to profit off of it.  \n\n\nFirst, long airlines. How are people going to get to Area 51? They're going to have get there somehow. I would recommend Spirit (SAVE) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) as they both have hubs at McCarran International Airport (Las Vegas Airport). [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarran\\_International\\_Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarran_International_Airport) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSecond, car rental companies. They all have to make at least an 80 mile trek out there, most likely more. The two I recommend are Hertz (HTZ) and Avis (CAR).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThird, the A-10 ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvIJvPj\\_pjE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvIJvPj_pjE) ) uses AIM-9 Sidewinders, AGM-65's and Mark 77 Bombs. The AIM-9 is made by Raytheon and Ford (RTN &amp; F), the AGM-65 is made by RTN as well. The Mark 77 bomb as far as I can tell was made by Rockwell who was then bought by Boeing  (BA). But we're not going to touch Boeing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTherefore, in my Wallstreebets expertise, I recommend the Area 51 ETF to be made up of:  \nSAVE, LUV, HTZ, CAR, RTN, F\n\nLong for profit.", "created_utc": 1563122762, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cd558r/how_to_profit_off_the_area_51_raid/", "is_self": true}
