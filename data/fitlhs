Is there ever a right time to?", "selftext": "Hey folks, wanted to talk about strategy in investing with leverage.  Currently my portfolio is only invested in two ETFs (SPY and QQQ) because simply put I like having some diversification while at the same time not having to read companies spreadsheets, business models, bottom lines, etc.  I understand a lot of the companies are duplicated in both, I understand that I'monly invested in large cap companies in the US and I understand that this may not be diverse enough, but I'm fine with that at my age (late 20-30 years old).\n\n---------- \n\n***Discussion with leverage in 3 phases:***\n\n**Phase 1 - Bull market:**\n\nI have been interested in investing a portion of my portfolio in SPXL or TQQQ for the short term (1 day to 30 days).  While SPY and QQQ were at an all time high for most of 2018 and 2019, there was always a fear in buying 3x leveraged etf because buying at an all time high has risk of an inevitable market crash. So investing with leverage was considered a no-no.\n\n**Phase 2 - Bear market:**\n\nNow we are at a point where we are no longer at an all time high, we can buy SPY and QQQ at a great discount, which I am doing currently everyday investing in a share per day.  I still want to invest with leverage but there is risk that because of COVID-19 \"things will get worse before they get better\".  So investing with leverage is still considered a no-no.\n\n**Phase 3 - Market picking back up:**\n\nEventually market will start picking up again, could be next week, could he next year, could be 5 years from now, who knows.  At that point that is ideally the time to confidently invest with leverage, but when do we know that the market is picking back up? When can we invest with leverage while assuring us that we are least at risk?  Tracking 50 day moving average?  Looking historically how and when markets recovered? \n\n---------- \n\n\nSorry if this post is not much help, but I am looking for some advice from other people who invest with leverage.", "created_utc": 1584236230.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fitlhs/most_of_the_time_you_should_not_invest_in_a_3x/", "is_self": true}
