A longer TLDR is at the bottom for autists who can't read.\n\nPOSITIONS: CCL 15/21C 30/40, RTX 15/21C 85, ZM 5/15 130/175 Strangle, 5/15 GME 4/6 Strangle, JPM 5/15C 120\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHello autists. I've had my fair share of gains and losses these past few months, and I'm not going to predict which fucking way the market is going to go because no number of magical voodoo lines on a chart is going to do fuckall to change the market. I know which way the market is going to go as much as the other guy, and literally everyone on this sub is autistic which is to say nobody fucking knows anything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Current Situation**\n\nData, however, doesn't lie. [https://www.crystalbull.com/stock-market-timing/Unemployment-chart/](https://www.crystalbull.com/stock-market-timing/Unemployment-chart/)\n\nThis chart shows that in 2008, peak unemployment numbers hit 7 months after the bottom of the market. Same thing in 2002, which had about an 8 month gap between the two. Yes, shit is bad out there. Millions are unemployed, poor people can't pay for food, goods, or rent. But that's the thing: the impoverished of the US are the most affected, AKA the smallest portion of the nation's spending power. Two decades of promoting excess and overspending have conditioned Americans to still shop regardless of their financial condition. Many of you are complaining why the market doesn't affect this. It's because everybody **KNOWS** about the job market going to shit. Everybody **EXPECTS**  bad news. Bad news no longer affects the market, good news will cause violent moves upwards. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Road to Recovery**\n\nOur economy is straight fucked. But we still have a populace that wants to spend money. To prove my point, cruise bookings are up [40% in the last 50 days](https://www.businessinsider.com/cruise-ship-bookings-are-increasing-for-2021-despite-coronavirus-2020-4) compared to 2019 bookings. In addition, the destruction to the economy is less than some of the apocalpytics here. [This website shows the average expenditures for Americans.](https://www.lexingtonlaw.com/blog/credit-cards/american-spending-habits.html) 84% of expenditures are necessities. That means the majority of US spending is still intact, and with new stimulus packages incoming it will help bolster this line of spending for a bit more (yes I realize the Fed is completely incompetent but the 1,200 stimulus checks will do *some* good). The phased recovery will bolster the economy even more, as services are slowly reinstated. Yes, more houses will be foreclosed, more businesses shuttered, and more jobs lost. But the economy as a whole will stay intact thanks to JPOW's 12 gauge liquidity minigun. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Stonk Market**\n\nThis is what ya'll actually care about. I have no idea where the stock market is going to go, but I can for sure tell you one thing; the initial stock market drop was fairly mild, with rumors driving price action. The massive increase volatility was mainly caused by the double black swan event (namely world pandemic and oil price war) that destroyed liquidity of major players in the market, forcing them to liquidate position to retain cash (this coupled with algos driving price action caused volatility to spike to 85-levels).  \n\nBut liquidity is back. MM's have all the cash they need to survive in this environment, and everyone is on prepared for another downwards spiral.  I see many posts talking about how \"unemployment numbers will drive markets down\" or \"reinfection will drive markets down\". Everybody and their mother knows about the potential for another shutdown, and shit is already priced in. While I'm not disputing the possibility of another downturn, it will not nearly be as violent because the catalysts contributing to high volatility in the initial drop are no longer there (liquidity crisis, unexpected). Everybody expects another downturn, and the fact that it's expected will make investors much more level headed about making trading decisions during a downturn. Short term plays still exist but you'll have to be relying on pure luck to make those plays. If you want consistent gains, LEAPS on stocks at their current bottoms such as CCL, RTX, and bigger bank stocks are great picks and potential 10-baggers in the next few months. Keep cash on hand and don't get burnt by theta by making stupid short term plays. A 10 bagger 3 months down the line is still better than zero next week. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Longer TL;DR: Catalysts for a sharp market downturn are gone, any drop will be slow. The stock market is not indicative of the current economy, but rather the more hopeful future. Don't let theta gang fuck you, make long plays for fat tendies.**", "created_utc": 1587090965.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2tcfu/stonk_market_economy/", "is_self": true}
