{"id": "f6bwoa", "title": "$AMD and $WORK : INSIDER", "selftext": "Hey Retards.\nThrowaway time. \n\nNo, this is not a troll. \n\n$AMD and $WORK have big announcements coming in the next week or so. Based on what's coming, I fully expect $AMD to almost wipe out any competition by the end of next year. They are solidifying a MASSIVE deal with the U.S military, and releasing beta results of a new super chip with never before seen capabilities.\n\nNot to mention, $MSFT is working on their flight simulator, but what's been kept secret is a \"fully immersive, near-reality\" VR world, with infinite possibilities, is being worked on. It's far out, but guess who's GPU's are going to be used to power it? Yup.\n\nAs for $WORK; as some of you may know, IBM just picked up and became their largest customer. I cannot say specifics, but they are the target in a large M&amp;A deal formulated to make them commonplace in any workplace (Call me Shakespeare;)). \n\nAnyway, I never post to delegate or give advice on trades, but I am DEAD serious when I say any call dated past March will ROCKET SHIP.
