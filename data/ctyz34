Dollar, equities, metals, bonds. Charts make no sense. What the fuck is going on? Were people just going flat to cash from, everything?? \n\nUsually metals and TLT is inverse to equities, both were selling. Usually TLT and HYG are inverse, both were selling. Usually dollar and metals are inverse, both were selling. \n\nOh, and let\u2019s not forget that the market tried their fucking hardest to not have the yield curve invert until the very end of the trading session yesterday. Fast forward to this morning and it inverts exactly when the Fed symposium opens up in WY. Almost like a shot across the bow.
