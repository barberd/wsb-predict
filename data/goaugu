{"id": "goaugu", "title": "Robinhood, vs. Webull, vs. Tastysnack for options trading?", "selftext": "I like Schwab and chase but options are expensive and I wanted to ask you guys what is the best among these 3 for options.\n\nRH has free options and the only one with instant deposits (without a full margin account) but everything else is shit. Including delays in price changes which is bad because you need to be quick.\n\nTastyworks is a bit more complex, but it has the best research of the three through tasty trade, and the complex table gives you more information about the underlyimg security or ticker. The mobile app is shit though. I can't figure out how to search and add stocks to my watch list, using the search bar in the settings cog doesnt let you add.\n\nWebull is more of a competitor to RH, though not as low cost overall it does give more info than robinhood does at the expense of speed. No instant deposits without full margin either. But otherwise has real customer service which RH lacks.\n\nSo just specifically out of these 3 since these are my only options, which do you think is the best value for options trading and why?\n\nI appreciate any legit insight given.", "created_utc": 1590114693.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/goaugu/robinhood_vs_webull_vs_tastysnack_for_options/", "is_self": true}
