Total cost basis (not including selling, including fees) is about **6694$** in actuals.\n\n\\---\n\nBecause of the increased interest rate, the oncoming correction will be that much harder due to credit expansion. In addition, supply side theory of the monetary policy is assuming that looser credit will be used to create economic gains through jobs and wages. Instead, a significant chunk has been and will be used for buybacks. This creates zero value for most people, and incredible value for the company and its shareholders. Still looking for that 100 bagger for the correction that should happen this year.\n\nReversed course EOD yesterday for 30 contracts of 299C 8/16.
