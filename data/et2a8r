Didn't even buy, just thought about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater in bed I got a fucking charley horse and it was so fucking bad. I thought it was gonna go from my calf all the way to my balls and I was going to end up on r/tifu talking about how I needed to get my testis amputated. My neighbors probably thought I was doing anal with another man but honestly I was just in so much pain. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI woke up this morning and bought 10 contracts of TSLA 700c and now my leg is just kind of wobbly and I just see chicken nuggets everywhere and I'm doing blow here with my boss and secretary. Don't think about buying puts\n\n  \nThanks for coming to my Ted Talk", "created_utc": 1579825599, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/et2a8r/never_think_about_buying_puts/", "is_self": true}
