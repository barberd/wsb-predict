How else can we go about getting the money back?\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/DO0fr1d\n\nKept throwing this error and didn't let close any existing positions that were bought this morning. Lost a ton of money :( Down close to 8k. \n\nHonestly, please let know if anything can be done to recover these losses. All trades & actions were recorded this morning.\n\nPositions:\nBA 145 puts - $5 to nothing. \nTesla 800 puts - $24 to shit.\nOther small positions\n\nEod ended day with +8k to -7k. \n\n**Account is over 25k but due to glitch my portfolio showed only half the balance, and this is usually a warning. But this time it kept throwing the same error and didn't allow to sell until noon. Tried turning off PDT but due to portfolio error(new RH error) my balance showed only 21k instead of 35k**\n\n**PS: To fellow autists who says I should quit RH, I use RH only to trade lottos and use other platforms, haven't fully migrated out.**", "created_utc": 1590622985.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/grv369/due_to_robinhood_incorrect_portfolio_value_error/", "is_self": true}
