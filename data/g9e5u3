{"id": "g9e5u3", "title": "Why the fuck is Alphabet Class A (GOOGL, voting rights) trading for less than Alphabet Class C (GOOG, no voting rights)?", "selftext": "Historically, Class A shares have always traded for slightly more, because Class A shares have voting rights attached to them. This itself has a small amount of value, and historically, this has reflected a slight premium vs. Class C shares.\n\nClass B shares are not publicly traded, they're held by insiders and have 10x voting power.\n\nClass C shares have no voting rights at all.\n\nSo why in the fuck is GOOG (Alphabet Class A) at $1,270.86 per share and GOOGL (Alphabet Class C) at $1,275.88 per share?\n\nThis is completely fucking irrational.\n\nAre we in an advanced simulation? Algorithms run the markets, machines have sentience, computer is having a joke, and humans are dumb as fuck.\n\nCan anybody seriously give me an answer?
