{"id": "dqa0ye", "title": "BABA - WTF??", "selftext": "I seriously need someone to explain to me what happened with BABA today. The stock was up close to 180 before pre-market BEFORE they announce earnings. Then they announce earnings - the blow past earnings. Revenue climbed 40% from the year-ago period, cloud-computing revenue jumped 64% to $1.3 billion. Overseas business boomed - tripled in Indonesia.\n\nThe stock then opens slightly higher, touches 182 and then fucking drills down LOWER than yesterday at 176. 46. Like seriously WTF. What am I missing? It doesn't make any sense at all. Volume was double than average yet price is stuck. Is the answer just market manipulation due to this being a chinese stock? Will it gain traction next week?", "created_utc": 1572640741, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dqa0ye/baba_wtf/", "is_self": true}
