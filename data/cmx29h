{"id": "cmx29h", "title": "TEVA to the Moon", "selftext": "Bull Case:\n\nThis article about a proposed 10 billion $ settlement came out today and it tanked the sector, Here\u2019s some names you might have heard:\n\nENDP down 21%\nMNK down 12%\nTEVA down 9.8%\nMYL down 5.9%\n\nNote: MYL just had the PFE deal so its down less,TEVA didn\u2019t get cut down as much as others considering.\n\nNow, if you\u2019re on this board you should read it [1]. In it you\u2019ll notice a couple of things:\n\nThe companies mentioned in the $10 billion settlement? Not TEVA, if fact, I can\u2019t even find TEVA mentioned in the article. Another fact, TEVA had 0.9% of the market share [2] yet TEVA got smacked today. TEVA got smacked last month and the month prior and the month prior (on and on). BUY WHEN THERE IS BLOOD IN THE STREETS LIKE TODAY. Honestly TEVA is undervalued in the sector and in the market as a whole. Management hasn\u2019t been talking about lawsuits for two reasons, one of which is painfully obvious:\n\n1) they are focusing on the COMPANY, developing products (look out for Epi Pen Jr in earnings call) to pay down the debt. That should be obvious, they aren\u2019t lawyers, they are hyper focused individuals who were brought in to reshape a failing organization, and they are stabilizing it in a solid, systematic manner.\n\n2) management doesn\u2019t feel the NEED to speak up, they didn\u2019t have a big roll at all in this, hence why they aren\u2019t actually mentioned in these recent articles. Sure Actavis is mentioned, but the weren\u2019t acquired until AFTER the time frame of the lawsuits in question. TEVA lawyers will deal with it so management can focus.\n\nThings to watch out for in earnings:\n- Epi Pen Jr.\n- Debt Payments\n- Positive Lawsuit Liability Dialogue\n\nTEVA is so beaten down and has such value behind it, they have plenty of potential catalysts for tomorrow and, depending on how good it is, has potential to squeeze to 9-12+ very soon.\n\n[1] https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2019/08/06/opioid-makers-said-to-propose-10-billion-settlement-to-end-state-lawsuits.html\n\n[2]\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/beta.washingtonpost.com/investigations/76-billion-opioid-pills-newly-released-federal-data-unmasks-the-epidemic/2019/07/16/5f29fd62-a73e-11e9-86dd-d7f0e60391e9_story.html%3foutputType=amp", "created_utc": 1565129887, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cmx29h/teva_to_the_moon/", "is_self": true}
