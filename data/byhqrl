I'm going to let you bears in on a little secret. Are you ready for it?? Here it is...\n\n*Buying puts is a sucker's bet.*\n\nDo not buy puts. Ever! Statistically, buying puts is one of the single worst trades you can make. In fact, selling at the money puts is historically the thing to do!!!!\n\nNow, you might counter that the market is about to crash, so buying puts is now the thing to do. WRONG!!\n\nThe biggest stock market rallies happen during bear markets. This is a fact! Just look at last week. \n\nThe thing to do is to patiently wait for a big drop; and then when VIX is over 20, you buy calls a few days out. \n\nThat's it. Free money. That's all you have to do. \n\nStop buying puts, you idiots. \n\nYou're welcome.", "created_utc": 1560064476, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/byhqrl/there_are_so_many_comments_this_weekend_from/", "is_self": true}
