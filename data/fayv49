So now i can pretend that a company like gilead that is mainly focused on AIDS research can somehow destroy the coronavirus and we make $ . so the coronavirus is simply a flu that spreads like a fuckin high school rumour - why do we care? This is just my 2 cents but i think gilead is a solid pharma researcher and their clinical trials are legit and global . hop on this train before its too late\n\nbuy gilead calls NOW 3/20 80$ or ur a \ud83c\udf08pussy and if u have a large set of balls 100$ calls are cheap as fuck - good luck retards \n\ntldr: Monday we will find out if gilead is making a corona virus vaccine - yolo call $90 3/20 GILD or ur a bitch", "created_utc": 1582913227, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fayv49/gilead/", "is_self": true}
