{"id": "fg1hko", "title": "Today I was absolute idiot and bought puts expiring today 1 minute before close, but wound up actually making profit.", "selftext": "Today I realized once again that I'm an idiot.\n\nAfter cashing out all my gains from Robinhood last week, I put $1000 of it into a TD Ameritrade account to play with as fun money, while I use the rest to pay off debt. I am not familiar with their UI at all yet, which lead to this glorious idiocy \n\nFiguring that the market would spike right before close like it has been on red days recently, I offloaded some positions about an hour before and waited for it to go up. It was seeming to go that way, until the very end when it started dropping. I held onto hope that it would reverse so I could get some cheaper puts, but right at the end I decided to just buy in anyways with a few hundred dollars and see how it goes.\n\nI was rushing to get the order in 1 minute to close, and I did it! Damn TD is good at filling trades, I thought, and all was well. Or so it was, until 4 minutes later when I realized I bought puts expiring today, March 9th, and markets were closed.\n\nFUCK\n\nWell, now in a low key panic and berating myself for being a retard, I went ahead and put an order to close my position in, not expecting anything to happen. Because you can't trade options after hours, right?? \n\nWrong, apparently, at least for SPY. It filled and I somehow almost doubled my money in 4 minutes.\n\nApparently being retarded pays \n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/CAFiU4b\n\nEdit: spelling", "created_utc": 1583786597.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fg1hko/today_i_was_absolute_idiot_and_bought_puts/", "is_self": true}
