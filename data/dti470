{"id": "dti470", "title": "November 15 puts on FSLY and AVTR", "selftext": "Both of these companies have performed alright since IPO, and both are at or above their IPO price. However, both will fall throughout the next week because they both have lockup expirations next Wednesday (11/13). FSLY lockup is 20\u00d7 the average volume and AVTR is 34\u00d7 the average volume, so needless to say both these expirations will give a lot of supply that won't be met by demand. Similarly, as we know with BYND, lockup expirations have a much larger effect when the market price is at or above IPO price as investors will want to take profits or avoid losses, so I'm expecting a large downward move in both before and during that day. Finally, it is clear that FSLY is on the downward trend because it reported great earnings and was up 15% in the morning but got dragged to basically flat as investors know the looming lockup expiration will be hard on the company. So, I recommend buying these puts today and riding out the gains through 11/13", "created_utc": 1573231817, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dti470/november_15_puts_on_fsly_and_avtr/", "is_self": true}
