I was kinda giddy about that, as volatility is my favorite investing instrument to use. For those who are open minded, or have converted back to bear cult, I would like to suggest we create a volatility gang. Before we get too deep into that though, I would like to say that since about early April I have been trading volatility quite a lot, and learning as much as I can about the VIX from reading CBOE\u2019s white sheet on it, to running infinite trade scenario analysis on TOS, to seeing how the VIX wiggles in real life.\n\nI\u2019d like to share some of the strategies I am using with WSB at large so people can do one of the following:\n\n1. Work into a great hedge that can protect you from massive downside\n2. Place a sizable (but not YOLO) bet on volatility\u2019s continuation and make good returns on the strategy (and why spreads on the VIX are not the way)\n3. Discuss the different instruments of volatility and how they can help you best\n4. Better understand the nuances of volatility trading\n\nI\u2019m going to write up different posts for one through three since they\u2019ll get pretty big in terms of complexity and detail. Number four will get cocooned into the other three as by necessity the nuances of volatility trading will come out in 1-3.\n\nBefore we get into number one, I would like to throw out a few disclaimers:\n\nTHIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. I am not responsible for your stupidity or inability to understand the information laid out here.\n\nVolatility trading is, as the name would suggest, volatile. If you don\u2019t have the stomach for wild swings, this is not for you. More than anything with volatility trading is temperament. You can have the best strategy in the world, but if you get caught up in every minute\u2019s tick you\u2019re going to be wound tighter than a watch and wind up clocking out at a bad time. I highly encourage meditation, frequent breaks, and sex midday which I have found can help reset you pretty well.\n\nVolatility instruments are complicated, and more often than not they won\u2019t work immediately. This is part of the process.\n\nWith the vix crushing down today to about 30 this might be a decent entry point for any volatility strategies. That said, be careful and diligent about implementing volatility strategies this week upcoming. Chances are we could see a real crush down to 26 or launch up towards 45+, so in all practical senses you are paying a bit more of a premium for this strategy than you may otherwise have. Be wary of this.\n\nI\u2019m keeping this post a bit longer than necessity because I want to offer helpful tips to people who are willing to put in the work, not give freebies to people who can\u2019t read three pages worth of text.\n\nOkay, so let\u2019s get into it:\n\n1. Work into a great hedge that can protect your dumb bull bets from massive downside\n\nYou\u2019re a perma bull. You can\u2019t stop charging ahead buying fuck tons of calls on NKE, AMD, whatever turns you on. But with the bomb of cases overrunning hospital capacity, you are decent enough to realize the risk factors to your bets just cranked up 50 dials.\n\nVIX calls long dated are for you.\n\nI will not be giving out specific strikes, because if you need that kind of hand holding you should not be trading this instrument. But, let\u2019s get into the specifics of the downside protection you get from Vix calls. \n\nThe Vix very specifically measures the farthest Bid-ask spread of greater then .01 difference on the option chain. Basically, it\u2019s measuring implied volatility, not as you\u2019ve likely heard it \u2018the amount of put buying.\u2019 So the Vix is basically inverse to the velocity of the market. The reason people confuse the vix with put buying is because we tend to see volatility on the way down, not on the way up. But as we\u2019ve currently been seeing volatility on the way up, you\u2019ll notice the Vix has been staying well above its resting value for awhile now. \n\nEven at the end of today, the Vix was going up with the market because the velocity of the move up was so quick. It\u2019s an important distinction to understand when trading the Vix.\n\nThat's the qualities of the Vix. Now, I\u2019m happy to share a few tips about VIX calls. The biggest thing about VIX calls is they are INEFFICIENT MOTHERFUCKERS. What do I mean by that? Well, when the Vix is cooking above, let\u2019s say 40, it\u2019s actually cheaper to buy the later dated option strikes than buying the near term options. \n\nIf you\u2019re a regular options trader, your brain\u2019s short circuiting at this. \u201cCheaper options further out? Astro, you\u2019re smoking a nice bowl man.\u201d \n\nNo. \n\nYou just haven\u2019t looked at the data like I have.\n\nHaving looked at the data, when the VIX was around 43 a couple weeks ago, this phenomena was in practice in plain view for everyone to see. The implied volatility on the front month options of the VIX were cooking so high (150%+) and the latest dated options were so cold in comparison (~60%) that there became a huge discrepancy between the front month and longest dated month options I personally capitalized on.\n\nNotably, this phenomena has smoothed out with the vix coming back down to 30 today, but its something to keep in mind in the future. Why?\n\nBecause when you Permabull start to notice downside momentum kicking in again, you might want to go and buy VIX options as a nice hedge on your position. Where should you be looking? No earlier than September in my opinion. Because also: let\u2019s say next wednesday the vix is cooking at 37, you buy in, and thursday morning a vaccine that\u2019s 80% effective is announced and coming to a Walgreens near you. Well your July vix calls would be fucked.\n\nBut your september calls would just be bruised. Pull out for a 50% loss instead of 90%. So not only do you get more time, you get fewer losses in case of a miracle return to normal. It\u2019s a wonderful fucking world isn\u2019t it? Now if this is a hedge, I would strongly encourage to let the calls either swell to a nice profit, or if we miraculously do find a thursday vaccine, let them expire worthless as downside protection to your bull case.\n\nOnce the vix is stewing around 50, you might be thinking \u2018Hey, those Vix 40 puts look great.\u2019 You go ahead and Yolo into the 8/19 40 puts. You go to sleep that night thinking about all the money you\u2019re going to make.\n\nYou wake up to the Vix at 48.9 and you\u2019re thinking \u2018great, I\u2019ll sell half and make a decent wad of cash. Maybe I can show my wife my portfolio and buy her love back.\u2019 You open your portfolio\u2014\n\n-to a slight loss.\n\nSo what happened? The theta burn on Vix puts, coupled with their lack of delta makes them bad tools when the Vix is at 50. If the Vix continues to go up from there, your Vix puts will get obliterated and the MM will be swimming in your incompetent tendies. If the Vix goes down only slightly, you\u2019ll be obliterated by an MM too.\n\nDon\u2019t buy Vix puts at 50 unless they are deep OTM, AND the likelihood of the vix going up is much less likely than it coming back down. Vix puts are a brutal tool and take forever to go your way, even if you\u2019re directionally correct. This is why I see them as useless tools unless the Vix heads north of 70. This is when Vix puts long dated become advantageous in my opinion, as the Vix has to fall back down and intrinsic value will make them valuable eventually.\n\nAnother thing about Vix is we are trading the NEW VIX MOTHERFUCKERS.\n\nIn 2014, CBOE realized there was a discrepancy with their baby Vix. She wasn\u2019t as accurate as she could be. Basically, due to how the vix is calculated, she was less volatile than true volatility in the market was. So when we \u2018broke\u2019 the old vix record, truthfully it wasn\u2019t that surprising since the new vix is going to go higher inevitably than the old vix due to the calibration of the equation.\n\nWhat does this mean for Vix call buyers?\n\nThat means in the next crash, whether it\u2019s next week or in december, we will likely not only see the Vix break its new record, but it could go even higher depending on the velocity of the crash. We could see it even go to 90 in a true crash event.\n\nThis is important to keep in mind as we prepare our portfolios for the next wave. Vix calls are the Market Maker\u2019s gift to you for hedging. They can pay out 10:1 depending on where you buy and how high the vix goes. So a 3% hedge can return you 30% of your portfolio's worth. My advice? Look into it. You may just come back thanking me at SPX 1900 for offering the lifeboat to your bull-headed portfolio. \n\nThat\u2019s all I\u2019m giving out for now. Depending on responses and interest level to this post, I\u2019ll write up a second post on topic number two.\n\nAlso: I\u2019d like to give a very special RIP to TVIX.\n\nTVIX, you were a distorted piece of shit with tiny-dick ability of tracking your underlying instrument. Credit Suisse only got rid of you when it benefitted them most. So fuck you, and I hope you burn in VIX heaven which is where all the bad VIX instruments go because they hate being up.", "created_utc": 1593550747.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hiw5zx/the_inception_of_volatility_gang_aka_volatility/", "is_self": true}
