I don't have enough money to cover 500 shares of the SPY and I wouldn't want to hold them.  \n\nWill I still be able to sell them if the market stops? How would robinhood handle this? I know they try to sell your option for you EOD but if the whole market stops and they can't sell them will I have 500 shares in my account over night? Or even worse, will they be worthless to me since I can't cover them?", "created_utc": 1583754846, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fftih6/i_have_5_spy_puts_expiring_today/", "is_self": true}
