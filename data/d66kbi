Lost on a GE call a couple weeks ago. My second option trade is a SPY put @ $292 in place till 9/27. \n\nAt one point, it reached 70% in returns this afternoon if I would have sold the contract. This was following the market trying to digest the Feds actions. \n\nI know the general response to this very much depends on a myriad of factors, but, I\u2019m curious if anyone has any hard fast rules regarding a percentage increase that prompts them to offload. Example: no matter what, if I see an 80% increase I\u2019m selling. Or, do you ride the bet till the wheels fall off.", "created_utc": 1568854560, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d66kbi/strategy_for_option_callsputs_bets_a_certain/", "is_self": true}
