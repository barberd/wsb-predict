{"id": "gf5tsm", "title": "Turtle Beach ($HEAR) earnings today. BUY CALLS!", "selftext": "Buy Calls for Turtle Beach ($HEAR) for today's AMC earnings. Here's why:\n\n\nEverybody in developed and high tech nations around the world is sitting at home playing video games, listening to music, watching $NFLX, and jumping into $ZM meetings. The headphones/earbuds market is CRUSHING it right now. EVERYBODY needs headphones, earbuds, etc. Look at $ZM! Look at $ATVI (owns Overwatch etc.)! Look at $NFLX!\n\n$ZM: https://i.imgur.com/lGqybWE.png\n\n$NFLX: https://i.imgur.com/55AR03S.png\n\n$ATVI: https://i.imgur.com/9m2bFZR.png\n\n\nTurtle Beach ($HEAR) is nowhere near their all-time highs. They've held pretty steady at ~$10 this year (except for the COVID-19 dip in the market, of course).\n\n$HEAR: https://i.imgur.com/6o5zx9m.png\n\n[Chart on Google](https://www.google.com/search?safe=off&hl=en-US&sxsrf=ALeKk00YtSjrdoaQzoddEAUz8UOqQw9GWQ:1588780809680&q=NASDAQ:+HEAR&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgecRoxi3w8sc9YSndSWtOXmNU5-IKzsgvd80rySypFJLkYoOy-KV4ubj10_UNU0oqk7KLCnkWsfL4OQa7OAZaKXi4OgYBAOkWFQxKAAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjVs6XezZ_pAhXFpZ4KHV2tALwQsRUwGXoECBQQAw)\n\n\nYesterday, their trading volume was insanely low. It averages at 766,004 and it was only 157,000 by the middle of the day yesterday. Nobody's paying attention to them right now. They are poised for a HUGE pop.\n\n$HEAR: https://i.imgur.com/saiy0Gm.png\n\n[Chart on Google](https://www.google.com/search?safe=off&hl=en-US&sxsrf=ALeKk00YtSjrdoaQzoddEAUz8UOqQw9GWQ:1588780809680&q=NASDAQ:+HEAR&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgecRoxi3w8sc9YSndSWtOXmNU5-IKzsgvd80rySypFJLkYoOy-KV4ubj10_UNU0oqk7KLCnkWsfL4OQa7OAZaKXi4OgYBAOkWFQxKAAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjVs6XezZ_pAhXFpZ4KHV2tALwQsRUwGXoECBQQAw)\n\n\nFurther evidence: ~ALL~ OF THEIR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD OUT ON AMAZON. Not \"we're having issues delivering\". No. SOLD OUT. THEY SOLD ~ALL~ OF THEM.\n\nTurtle Beach on Amazon: https://i.imgur.com/CxpwYZ0.png\n\n(https://www.amazon.com/stores/Turtle+Beach/page/05693197-8AB2-406B-8021-A3E7B558207F?ref_=ast_bln)\n\nEdit: my bad here they sold out of most of their top products not all. Still fucking nuts!\n\n\nThe bottom line is: their costs are minimal thanks to COVID, their revenue is HUGE! They're going to totally blow this earnings report out of the water and have lots of cash to reinvest into the company and continue to grow. In fact, they've beaten on all their last few earnings.\n\nAll photos: https://i.imgur.com/a/hhhR1wf\n\n\n**TL;DR:**\nBuy $HEAR calls. Thanks to COVID, they've sold out all their headphones with more shipments coming in soon. Their costs will be nearly $0 and they'll have huge revenue. Volume is TINY and the stock is super cheap.\n\nHEAR 12c 6/19\n\nHEAR 12.5c 7/17\n\nHEAR 13c 10/16", "created_utc": 1588855387.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gf5tsm/turtle_beach_hear_earnings_today_buy_calls/", "is_self": true}
