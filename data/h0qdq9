The price dropped the day before yesterday due to not so good Q1 earnings report.\n\nThis is not really a full DD, but:\n\n1. Slack\u2019s price drops pretty bad after every earnings call, yet the company then rebounds and reaches new highs. This could be due to a lack of effective communication with the shareholders (i.e., expectations vs reality).\n2. The company is growing pretty well, with high gross margins (\\~87%, as of Q1 2020), decent year over year growth rate (\\~11%, as of Q1 2020) and plenty of cash. \n3. Big sharks recognize the WORK\u2019s potential. Microsoft is trying hard to push Teams as a competitor to Slack. At the same time, Amazon just linked a partnership with Slack to take on Microsoft Teams. And considering that Amazon turn pretty much everything they touch into a pile of cash, I think this partnership can be quite promising. \n4. Technicals are pretty good too. RSI is 45 and based on MACD, it's starting to trend upwards.\n5. Finally, the killer - stonks only go up, especially in tech! \n\nI got 6/19 38C today just to test my theory. Closed +15% just in a few hours before the market closed. Going balls deep at open tomorrow.\n\n**Tl;dr. WORK 6/19 38C**", "created_utc": 1591843134.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h0qdq9/long_work_its_trading_on_sale_stonks_only_go_up/", "is_self": true}
