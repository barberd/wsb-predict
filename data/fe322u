Here's the DD\n\n\"Up in the morning\" - This in reference to market open. Kanye lives in Los Angeles so he has to be up from 6:30 AM.\n\n\"Miss you bad\" - Talking about all the money he deposited and lost in his RH account. \n\n\"Sorry I ain't called you back\" - Margin called...\n\n\"Same problem my father had\" - Kanye's father was a gambler and professional autist, and Kanye decided to take after his father's footsteps\n\n\"All his time, all he had, all he had, in what he dreamed\" - Time is referring to THETA fucking him in the ass. He dreamt of having all that he had but he woke up to 0.69c value.\n\n\"All his cash, Market crashed\" - Kanye predicted the market crash this year from back in 2016. He knew about beer flu coming into town and knew this shits going down\n\n\"Hurt him bad\" - The government tortured him into not telling us about it\n\n\"People get divorced for that\" - Referring to Kim showing us her baboon butt\n\n\"Drop some stacks, pops is good\" - This is the cycle of the autist. He thinks if he can pour some more money in, the next contract has to make me rich\n\n\"Momma pass in Hollywood, if you ask, lost my soul\" - Kanye is clearly less coherent than we even predicted here \n\n\"Driving fast, lost control\" - Kanye comes back to his senses here and is speaking in reference to $SPCE. $SPCE was mooning driving so fast to get there, then lost control and fucking landed in the gutters.\n\n\"Off the road, jaw was broke\" - Broken jaw helped with blowjobs to make up for the lost money in the market\n\n\"Member we all was broke\" - Final step of denial, acceptance. Accepting that you'll never get rich in this market\n\n\"Member I'm coming back, I'll be taking all the stacks\" - Back to the first step of the loop, THIS contract HAS to make me rich. \n\nThank you all for cuming to my Autist Talk", "created_utc": 1583446069.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fe322u/kanye_west_is_an_active_member_of_wsb_and/", "is_self": true}
