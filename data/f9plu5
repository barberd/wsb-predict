{"id": "f9plu5", "title": "DD about the Italian Market ($EWI", "selftext": "After reading this thread: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9oofe/eetsa_debt_bubble/\n\nI decided to do some of my DD of my own. I Infiltrated /r/Italy in order to get the general reaction around the coronavirus outbreak, asking them about how their media, companies, and public was responding to the outbreak. It seems like the media is blowing it out of proportion and several companies arenot operating because of the virus. what does this mean? SHORT $EWI!\n\nwe are trading faggy D\u2019s (FD\u2019s), we need to earn money over public and media perception, not how realistic it is that this gay ass virus will topple their economy!\n\nAnother good reply from my meatball friend: \u201cThis is speculation my dear American. It is despicable.\nMoreover, if you want to know. I will bet against everyone. Especially the States where the healthcare system is already a joke because it is not available for EVERYONE. Probably the virus is already widespread EVERYWHERE.\nThe only protocol in place was to ask if people came back from China. Or something like that. It was not a good idea.\u201d\n\nAKA SHORT THEIR ECONOMY \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/v2jxIX9/", "created_utc": 1582701860, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9plu5/dd_about_the_italian_market_ewi/", "is_self": true}
