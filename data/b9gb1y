{"id": "b9gb1y", "title": "Short Term Avocado Play To Make Some Guac $CVGW", "selftext": "Trump has been going on about closing the Mexican borders to stop illegal immigration, and because of that the value of US avocados has been going through the roof. 86% of the avocados the US consumes are imported, of which 88% come from Mexico. \nCVGW has been mooning today on this news and I don\u2019t see any reason for them to stop until trump backs down. So if you want to yolo some Avocado calls I am in the 4/18 95c\u2019s for hopefully some 500% gains like the 90c\u2019s had today. \nYes the liquidity is ass, take that as your will. \n\n[Minimal DD link ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/looming-avocado-shortage-drives-up-prices-as-trump-threatens-to-close-united-states-border-with-mexico/)", "created_utc": 1554401898, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b9gb1y/short_term_avocado_play_to_make_some_guac_cvgw/", "is_self": true}
