I know I want to buy more puts - so I've been trying to figure out what the best contracts to buy are if I make *reasonable* assumptions to when/where SPY will go. The two assumptions I used are that SPY will hit $180 by 4/03 and then that SPY will hit $170 by 4/03- will it happen? Maybe, idk but you idiots believe in witches so who are you to judge. If there are any fundamental issues with my work, let me know so I can fix it.\n\nNotes:\n\n* There's *a LOT* of underlying assumptions being made for this - I could be so wrong it's laughable\n* I could've calculated way more but these seemed reasonable and took me two hours so fuck you\n* The current SPY price was based on Friday (3/20) close, meaning all contracts will be different come Monday open - but I believe the concept still generally stands\n* I used my current buying power for the last three columns to see how much I could make if I full YOLO this shit\n* If anyone knows a program that can do this for me please fucking let me know it took so long to do all this by hand; switching between RH, optionsprofitcalculator, and excel", "created_utc": 1584803676.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmgg6l/i_manually_calculated_profit_margins_on_various/", "is_self": true}
