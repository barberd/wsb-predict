Well.. we all are.\nLong story short. Retired at 38 with $2m, years in IT with idea of playing the markets for living (overconfidence due to success in IT). Then made some, lose some, go to $0 in 2 years.\n\nThen.. snowball hits especially hard as liabilities and family grow - end up on drugs to don't reach for the rope. Regret I didn't start early as I was always thinking I need big capital to start and do it then full time as only then it makes sense.. but greed is killing.\n\nWonder your experiences and how you handled that cycle: BIg Capital -&gt; Full time trading \"dream\" -&gt; Blown up -&gt; Depression + drugs ... what next? I am better now but just as addicted autist just lost another $50k (out of $100k i put aside) on one day catching the knife on /ES .. feeling like shit! \n\nOthers: do not let this happen to you - it is not only $$$ but also your life on the line. yolo only when you are young.", "created_utc": 1583576666, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fetesi/autist_on_drugs_in_depression/", "is_self": true}
