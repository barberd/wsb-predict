{"id": "d53ik7", "title": "$SQ New Trading App War Request", "selftext": "I, like many of you all, have heard of the rumors that Square is testing a commission free trading platform to rival Robinhood. If this turns out to be true (first Long $SQ), I propose we split into autist factions of the SQ Warriors vs the RH Archers. Whoever can bring out the most autism will be the winner of WSB for the week. Also if the SQ allows more margin than RH, I expect nothing but more unsubsidized student loans to be taken out by you beautiful tards. Let\u2019s go Jack Dorsey! Do it for WSB!", "created_utc": 1568653175, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d53ik7/sq_new_trading_app_war_request/", "is_self": true}
