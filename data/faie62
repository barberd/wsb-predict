{"id": "faie62", "title": "More good news for PTON, this stock is going to rebound bigly once the recession is over", "selftext": "*A few days ago, I [posted](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7vj1j/pton_v_flywheel_settlement_is_actually_a_huge/) about how Flywheel's settlement with PTON was a big deal- bottom line, PTON was able to get a major win in defense of their patent for live-streamed, at home fitness classes that set a precedent for PTON to remain dominant in the field and avoid competition.\n\n*IPO lockup expired on the 24th, which many in the discussion thread insisted would cause mass insider sell-off. Not only did this not happen, but the stock *rose* from $25 to $27- literally the only green position in my portfolio that day. For context, that was the day SPY started tumbling. PTON has maintained itself over the past few days at ~27-28.\n\n*PTON just [settled](https://www.engadget.com/2020/02/27/peloton-settles-music-licensing-lawsuit/) with the NMPA for usage of music. Terms weren't disclosed, but this was the only quantifiable downside to their operations as they demonstrate growth (potential of unsettled lawsuit). \n\n*PTON still has an insane 88% short interest. Any significant move towards 30 is going to force shorts to cover and drive the price up even further. The fact that PTON has maintained, let alone increased, during this recession week is insane. Any other normal bull week this would have mooned to 35 on settlement + insider holding news alone.\n\n*News sites, in their effort to fill the 24hr news cycle, keep referencing PTON as beer virus-proof as people may have a tendency towards staying inside rather than going to gyms and getting infected. This could easily drive sales into an even more profitable quarter. \n\n*Rumors of PTON developing + selling an elite/VIP version of the bike and a rower in the next six months indicate that their model is sufficiently profitable for both R&amp;D AND expansion outwards. \n\nTL;DR PTON is on sale right now, April calls are looking tasty.", "created_utc": 1582835501, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/faie62/more_good_news_for_pton_this_stock_is_going_to/", "is_self": true}
