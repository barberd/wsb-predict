The great thing about this strategy and other credit strategy is that you really dont depend on direction of stock. As long as the price is within expected range you would not lose money. However like all other credit strategies your profit is cappedd.  Here's an example of trade that I opened yesterday and closed today for a 70% profit. \n\nI anticipated that SPCE will need a breather after this parabolic move. Also it didn't drop below $30 which  though was a good support after the selloff. When stock was trading at around $35 the IV was almost 300% for today's expiry. I opened the following for $3.8 ish credit. Expected move was $6\n\nSell Feb 21 35 put \nSell Feb 21 35 call\nBuy Feb 21 29 put\nBuy Feb 21 41 call\n\nI closed it today after lunch for about $1.4. \n\nTry it. Like all other strategy it will not work all the time but theta decay or iv crush will be on your side. \n\nANother example (earning ): sold ROKU 120-140-160 Iron Butterfly for $14 right before market close, closed the trade next day 30 min after market open for around $7.", "created_utc": 1582338824, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7m6sl/iron_butterfly_i_dit_it_on_restoration_hardware/", "is_self": true}
