Enemy teams working together (discord? Idfk); 3. EA not yet moving to fix the problem.\n\nAs a gamer, there is nothing worse Than cheaters. And their competitors PubG and Fortnite are ontop of these issues. \n\nSome Internet cafe owner specifically commented about seeing regular Apex players (customers) going back to PubG, Fortnite and even Csgo. (They Track what games players play and more of them are play a couple Apex games then moving to their old favourites mid session).\n\nWhat does this mean for the stock? Idk. Just pointing out that EA\u2019s two big early hopefuls for 2019 are having some troubles", "created_utc": 1554100839, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b7yjwe/shit_ea_dd_apex_legends_has_a_cheaterhacker/", "is_self": true}
