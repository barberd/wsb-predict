There are already 3000+  cases in the US (1000 known, but judging by the mortality rate of the first cohort, I'd say that number is \\~3000 at least two weeks ago. and possible 10,000+ these days)Containment is long gone.\n\nWhen that becomes clear the flights will resume. what happens then?\n\nLikewise about the virus itself. since for the general population under 60 , the risk factors are very low, rather than quarantine everyone, what if society goes out, but seniors and sick people alone are quarantined ?at some point someone will suggest that mortality rates for healthy people under 50 are very very low, and the economy can resume.----OTOH what will cause a big short term scare? a dead senator? what about a week later when it turns out all the senators under 60 got better?", "created_utc": 1583987537.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhat7o/lets_talk_about_how_this_crash_winds_down/", "is_self": true}
