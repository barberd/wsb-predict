I want to lock in my profit by selling the 5/29 $200c today for more than 2.12. I want to make sure that I will still profit if the stock goes above 200 and I am assigned on the short leg. If I don't have the $19,000 in my account to purchase the 100 shares at 190, will my option expire and I will still have to the shares on the assigned option? Or will Robinhood purchase the shares for me and then sell then to the other party without me having the funds in my account? I'm trying to make sure I'm not super fucked if that happens.", "created_utc": 1590690048.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gsbl4b/question_about_turning_call_into_a_spread/", "is_self": true}
