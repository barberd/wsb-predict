{"id": "ekgsi1", "title": "PTON outage yesterday and short interest update", "selftext": "When I spoke to customer service, I had them ask whether the outage yesterday was from hacking or a scheduled maintenance issue. They checked with their tech team and apparently the outage was caused by a server load issue. Too many people trying to logon at once. Probably a good sign.\n\nI\u2019m still holding my Jan 17th calls but obviously down on my initial purchase. I also own some March calls. \n\nIt would be ideal if the company announced the Peloton rower at CES this week, but not looking likely since PTON doesn\u2019t seem to have a floor booth on the CES app/map/schedule. \n\nLast I checked- short interest was in the mid to high 60% range and short borrow rate at IB was 22% with 300k shares to borrow and 12% borrow at Fidelity with 0 shares available to borrow. \n\nEarnings will be coming out in Feb (barring some pre announcement of holiday sales).", "created_utc": 1578248636, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ekgsi1/pton_outage_yesterday_and_short_interest_update/", "is_self": true}
