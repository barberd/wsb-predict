Here\u2019s What To Expect.", "selftext": "Advanced Micro Devices is likely to post strong results when the company announces first-quarter earnings after the close of trading on Tuesday.\n\nFor the quarter, the company (ticker: AMD) previously projected revenue of $1.8 billion, up 42% from a year ago. The consensus among Wall Street analysts calls for $1.78 billion in revenue and profits of 18 cents a share.\n\nAMD rival\u2019s Intel (INTC) last week reported better-than-expected March quarter results, driven by strength in both the personal-computer and cloud-server sectors. The memory-chip producer Micron Technology (MU) likewise recently reported strong results, driven by both PC and server demand.\n\nIn Intel\u2019s case, investors had a mixed reaction to the news, largely because of concerns about the outlook. Intel withdrew its previous financial forecasts for the full year, citing uncertainties tied to the Covid-19 pandemic and the associated financial downturn. Intel also cautioned that tailwinds boosting sales of PCs and servers in the first quarter were likely to fade in the second half of the year, due in part to a likely slowing of corporate spending.\n\nOne key question will be whether AMD maintains its current forecast for revenue for the full year, which calls revenue growth of 28%-30%. The Wall Street consensus, for $8.6 billion in sales, implies growth of 27.7%, slightly below the target range\n\nFor the second quarter, the consensus view is that revenue will total $1.92 billion and that per-share earnings will be 21 cents.\n\nhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/amd-reports-earnings-tuesday-heres-what-to-expect-51588019021", "created_utc": 1588083661.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9o28o/amd_reports_earning_today_heres_what_to_expect/", "is_self": true}
