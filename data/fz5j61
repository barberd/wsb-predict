The golden nugget in the article, that's a pure tell, is the mention that Trump is creating a council to advise on re-open. Ladies and gentleman the time for PUTS is upon us!! Trump is a gay lame retard in many ways, but he's also very smart in certain ways too.  He understands his people. Trump knows where things are headed and he's now created a special council as a scapegoat to point his finger at when the economy starts and continues to reverse and we still remain closed. He knows his supporters are retards who think we should open the economy up despite the coronavirus in order to \"save the economy\".  He's recognized this and is creating this council to be ther bad guy,  ergo showing his hand that things are ABOUT TO GO SOUTH!!!", "created_utc": 1586612661.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fz5j61/trump_says_us_to_remain_closed_longer_than/", "is_self": true}
