This is for 5/2-5/4. I\u2019m your host and resident autist u/expander2. You have to be able to read to gain anything from this so that rules out about half of you. As always, ticker is in bold on the left and what I deem \"important\" is near the top of the post. A TLDR, plays, and previous DD summaries will be at the bottom. My last posts still stand and hold some good info so check it out for more plays if this isn't enough for you greedy fucks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst things first. Remember that we are reading *Money; A Suicide Note* for the [WSB Books event](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g85inu/wsbooks_vol_1_money_a_suicide_note_4pm_et_516/). It can be bought (which is recommended) or [downloaded here](https://epdf.pub/money-a-suicide-note129e7b0df400a345810ae585631783a94603.html). It will download as a LIT file then upload it to [this site](https://anyconv.com/lit-to-pdf-converter/) and re-download as a PDF. This event is aimed at making everyone a better trader and having a little autistic fun at the same time.  Now for the DD.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Z;**  Let's take a look at Zillow. They are an interesting company. This is an excerpt straight from their website;\n\n>Zillow serves the full lifecycle of owning and living in a home: buying, selling, renting, financing, remodeling and more. It starts with Zillow's living database of more than 110 million U.S. homes - including homes for sale, homes for rent and homes not currently on the market\n\nThey are a big business raking in $2.7 billion in 2019. However, looking at [their 10-K](https://last10k.com/sec-filings/z#link_fullReport) from that same year shows a $300 million loss which is up about $180 million from 2018. That's not good. They are consistently spending much more than they bring in but somehow are still seen as a good company. Their debt also rose in 2019 from about $700 million in long term debt to a whopping $1.5 BILLION. All these numbers are straight from their 10-K (Feel free to thank me and thank u/fuzzyblankeet too for teaching me how to understand this shit). At the end of 2019 they had 2,707 homes in their inventory.\n\nNow you ask, \u201cWhat do we do with all these big numbers that I don't understand?\u201d, and I say, \u201cYou just fucking look at them.\u201d So here is what we can take away from this. This is a company that is consistently losing money, has more than doubled their debt in a year, and much of their asset value comes from owning 2,707 houses. What happens to the price of homes in a recession? It fucking drops\u2026 like a lot. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gdbzyn/home_sales_to_fall_up_to_60/) goes over some basic stuff but more importantly it shows what they just released which is a statement saying it might take UNTIL 2021 TO RECOVER. Damn, that sucks. Earnings come out on 5/7 after close so puts for 5/15 because you can't sell options that expire that day. But more than that, this is a long term play too. Zillow will not do well in a recession and we haven't quite entered one yet. If you want, look far out for puts. Could be a smart thing especially given all this information.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Next Leg Down;** For another explanation on why we are rising in the midst of a pandemic,  read [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gd1t2g/dddd_the_rise_of_buy_the_dip_retail_investors_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) or read the last few lines right here;\n\n>This entire bull rally has been fueled by new retail investors buying the dip, bringing the stock price to euphoric levels. Over the past few weeks, we\u2019ve been seeing the people waiting at the sidelines for years to get into the stock market slowly FOMO into the rally in smaller and smaller volumes, while the smart money have been locking in their profits at an even slower rate - hence an ascending wedge. As the amount of new retail interest in the stock market started slowed down, the amount of new bulls started to decline. This doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ll instantly go back to circuit breakers, we might see 282 -> 274 -> 284 -> 274 happen before panic, this time by the first-time investors, eventually bringing us down.\n\nI cut a couple things out so this isn't a direct quote but it's what you need to understand. Millions of first time investors are \u201cbuying the dip\u201d and when they stop doing this in such large numbers then the real gravity of the situation we are in will hit. It will be all Uh-oh\u2019s and fuck-me\u2019s from then till we hit the bottom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Oil Reminder;**  Oh and remember those tanker plays I recommended on the [4/9-4/13](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0nkrl/summary_of_dd_from_49413_insider_trading_oil/) post? Those fucking printed. So remember the [4/23-4/24](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7f1m6/dd_from_423424_live_nation_oil_starbucks_and/) post I made about land based oil storage? Those are going to print too so get in while you can.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Unusual Activity;** This isn't a big thing for me but it may help a few of you.  CNX Resources (CNX) is an oil and gas company and their earnings were terrible. Here's what is interesting; there was 32K open interest for Jul 6P, 28k puts for Oct 5p, and only 10k calls for Oct. Isn't that a little strange. That a lot of volume for a small company, seems like someone knows something we don't.\n\nThen there is Wright Medical Group NV (WMGI) which makes medical devices like joint implants and bone fixation devices for the foot and ankle and some other shit. They have 10k Aug 25P, 10k Aug 30p, and less than 4k volume for every other month. Weird. Do what you want with this information. I don't plan to do anything with these and wont include them in the TLDR or Plays. Here is [the original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gcgyg5/3_unusual_options_activity_from_last_week/) going into more detail about this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast thing, I plan to make an entire separate post detailing my strategy when doing earnings plays tomorrow. I will go over how I decide when to sell and what it looks like when things go wrong. I decided to leave it out of the DD summaries because it is its own category and would take up a lot of space in already long posts. Let me know if you guys are interested in this!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck fuckers and tune in on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for more WSB DD Summaries!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR;** Zillow is absolute horse shit, next leg down is because of all the new money, land based oil is a good idea along with tankers, earnings play information session will come out tomorrow.\n\n**Plays;** Z puts for 5/15 and much farther out if you are willing to wait, MPLX, PAA, PBFX, DKL, SHLX, CNXM, MMP, and PAGP calls for late May/early June.\n\n**Previous WSB DD Summaries;** [4/23-4/24](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7f1m6/dd_from_423424_live_nation_oil_starbucks_and/), [4/25-4/27](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9a05f/dd_from_425427_the_markets_future_wingstop_huazhu/),[ 4/28-5/1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gby6ez/dd_from_42851_match_alphabet_and_a_reminder_tldr/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDISCLAIMER; I am not personally advocating for any play that I add to this list. I merely go through a couple of days of posts and find what I think is competent DD.
