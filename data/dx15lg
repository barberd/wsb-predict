I closed the business a few months ago and have money &amp; time on my hands. \n\nOver the summer I found an old brokerage account I forgot about. I used it for speculative trading. Years ago I took the account from $10K to $90K to under $2K, then stopped looking at it and stopped with the spec trading. The last trade I made was Jan, 2012 &amp; the last time I looked at it was at the end of 2012. A stock I bought around $6 was around $2.50 and had $300 cash. Over the years I forgot about it &amp; even forgot the username &amp; password. \n\nOver the summer I found the account, recovered the logon info &amp; and my eyes popped out. The stock I bought in 2012... 700 shares of AMD! It was trading around $30 at the time. That was found money and I'm back in business boys! \n\nI took some time to re-educate myself on option trading, sold some AMD shares (kept some) and have the account up to $30K now (from a low of $17K). I could have let all the AMD shares sit, but what fun is that? The weed stock puts were very good to me this past week. \n\nI won't be doing any yolo's (been there, done that), but look forward to joining the action you got going on here. I just hope I last more than 3 months, ha ha.", "created_utc": 1573872634, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dx15lg/how_about_a_welcome_for_an_old_time_autist/", "is_self": true}
