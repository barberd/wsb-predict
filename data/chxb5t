Ended up paying 0.15 per for a total of $120. I thought it would see a little tiny bump (like. I was thinking a 0.5% change) and I'd be able to sell the swing tomorrow. But hahahaha, boy was I wrong. \n\nHandy dandy online options profit calculator is telling me that if the share price of SBUX is around 96.99 (just going with the after hours price) that I can sell these suckers for 1.15 per option for a total of $920.\n\nCan I really trust this calculator? Did I really just YOLO myself to a 667% return? Or am I missing something fundamental here?", "created_utc": 1564109451, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/chxb5t/question_about_what_i_can_expect_from_a_yolo_sbux/", "is_self": true}
