{"id": "dtra7v", "title": "PFE Opportunity", "selftext": "Hey,\n\nI've been following ABBV, BMY, and PFE, and hold all in my IRA.\n\nEarlier in the year, both ABBV and BMY announced acquisitions and then the stocks went down. Afterward they went up again, while also paying strong dividends. PFE recently had some business thingy with mylan that made their stock go down, but it hasn't gone back up again yet. (see below charts)\n\nABBV\n\n[ABBV - 5.67 Dividend](https://preview.redd.it/vtfm1pag7lx31.jpg?width=1209&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=618a9e4af5facdbafac55a498b6cc5ec7aba07b2)\n\nBMY\n\n[BMY 2.85 Dividend](https://preview.redd.it/6elig0bn7lx31.jpg?width=1206&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=517f66496e4936ecaa478b8fdee6b06e5922500f)\n\nI think that PFE is the next opportunity to take advantage of this pattern. (Green line added by me as projection of possible growth)\n\n[PFE 3.9&amp;#37; Dividend](https://preview.redd.it/nv2njk3z7lx31.jpg?width=1536&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf4938ec3bd012c60232553eaa3e5878af95c220)\n\nA rise to the stock price of $47 would give PFE a 3% dividend, which is still good. This would also make my  calls worth 15K!\n\nThe other thing is that the PFE Calls are really cheap, even distantly out of the money, for example the march 20 $41 calls are now 0.26 each. (it seems I bought too early, and have a 61% loss at this time, but will catch up). I will keep adding more PFE calls in the upcoming weeks as I cash out of other positions.\n\n[Current PFE Positions](https://preview.redd.it/09bbynzg8lx31.jpg?width=1443&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0433dcdf5f5c3594ac0401435e849b20a942edb4)\n\nI think the low option premiums make this a high reward to risk ratio idea.", "created_utc": 1573274009, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dtra7v/pfe_opportunity/", "is_self": true}
