The reason for the drop is debated but insiders report that a quant at SPY headquarters slipped on a pile of money and fell against a window, inadvertently opening the curtain and allowing an unspecified number of algo servers to see the world outside.  It is being reported at this hour that the servers are bearish due to seeing 3 of the four biblical horseman of the apocalypse fly down fifth avenue with flaming swords of the end times.\n\nAfter seeing the pullback, several retards in the daily thread decided to contribute the best of their keen intellect and made bold, and incredibly stupid predictions.  WSB newcomer u/brundonius was reported as saying *\u201dEveryone knows we\u2019re closing the day bullish.\u201d* u/amoctar , not content to leave his brain damaged screeching unheard simply stated *\u201cgreen eod\u201d* Unsurprisingly, both of these users were reported dead several hours later when they mistook a rat trap as a hot pocket and decided to share luncheon.\n\nThe selloff ended abruptly when thousands of previously affirmed permabears decided to experiment with other orientations and bought puts at the bottom.  \n\n##The War at 302\nFighting intensified today between the Axe Bodyspray Chads and Logic Neckbeard Virgins today.  Chads were pushed back throughout the morning but appear to be holding ground.  Published below is a letter from the front.\n\n*My dearest Gertrude,*\n\n*It is with a heavy heart that I report the bears have overrun 304, fighting is fierce, and I cannot help but admire these brave gay beasts.*\n\n*The bulls have set up their last stand at 302, and fighting is thick.  And they are giving it their all.*\n\n*The 420th division \u201cFighting Chads\u201d have entrenched with their Red Bull cannon.  And the memechine gun nests are numerous and well protected.  The 69th brigade \u201cthe flying BA gang\u201d has been bombing bears with insults and cargo shorts for hours.  But I fear the bears ultimate weapon \u201cReality\u201d will make it all for naught.*\n\n*What will be the outcome? I cannot say.  There is so much blood.*\n\n*Yours in SPY strangles,  -REDACTED-*\n\n###Impotent Rage at the Nations Capitol\n\n\nFinally, President Trump took an opportunity today to take a stroll on the White House lawn this afternoon.  Upon spying a large oak tree, he is reported to have frowned, steeled himself in fury and shouted *\u201dLAW AND ORDER!\u201d* at the plant.   Numerous squirrels stopped what they were doing for a full 10 seconds before resuming their business.", "created_utc": 1593030900.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hf8wp4/wall_street_bets_journal_issue_2/", "is_self": true}
