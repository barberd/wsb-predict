{"id": "hiy8hx", "title": "Turbo Tax Sucks Ass", "selftext": "Two days ago Hasan Minaj posted another video, and he made a website that had the IRS free filing forms. An idea occurred to me. Their earnings report will be on August 20th, and their ER will show how many Americans have actually gotten scammed ($60 to $120) by Inuit's fake \"free\" website. Therefore for the governments best interest, so that they wont have lobbyists on their asses, for us, so that some Autist does not have to pay $120 for a $1 dividend, and benefits for every American....we should share this website to everyone we know. What's in it for us you ask? While they get the toppings on the sundae, we get the entire desert. We can buy OTM INTU puts and short the crap out of their stock and hopefully make a 500% return. I have no idea if sharing his website will cause any trouble to this sub.....so to the mods feel free to delete my post if it does......But I personally believe taking down and shorting a tax prep company, who is trying to make file taxes harder, is pretty American.
