I then switched to short term, often day trades, without a long term view.  Last week on 5/12 I talked about a wedge and a possible bounce off it's top to test support.  On 5/13, we saw that happen.  On 5/14 I talked about a bounce off the .5 FIB, and we saw that happen.  Trading those moves, I made $2635.\n\n[Love $0 options trades, thanks RH](https://preview.redd.it/ltlif0zrpcz41.png?width=689&format=png&auto=webp&s=96d28e94f0a9aafaa426b5c0d422553883dd5afd)\n\n# The Dollar and Liquidity\n\nI talked [last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ggllpl/the_normie_playbook_lacking_a_catalyst/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) about any significant sell off needing a catalyst.  I'm a big believer that there are many possible micro catalysts, but they all trigger one macro catalyst: a liquidity crisis.  If you believe this market is going down hard and fast, then you almost certainly believe the world is going to sell assets (bonds, equities, commodities, etc.) to raise dollars to cover a need for liquidity.  That race becomes self destructive, and it can trigger massive crashes in the market.\n\n# Some Numbers and News\n\nFirst, some news.  I didn't intentionally make the bull case weaker this week, I just didn't happen upon as much throughout the week.  I'm sure there's more worth adding, but right now, the bears are piling on the straw:\n\n**Bullish**\n\n* [Carnival sees massive bookings](https://nypost.com/2020/05/09/carnival-swamped-with-bookings-after-announcing-august-return/?utm_source=reddit.com)\n* [Inflation doesn't look to be an issue](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/consumer-inflation-posts-biggest-decline-in-april-since-2008-as-prices-sink-cpi-shows-2020-05-12)\n* [Democrats pass 3T stimulus bill](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-vote-democrats-3t-coronavirus-heroes-aid-stimulus-checks-money-n1207816)\n\n**Bearish**\n\n* [Germany struggles with outbreaks on cusp of reopening](https://www.newsweek.com/germany-cusp-reopening-scrambles-contain-fresh-coronavirus-outbreaks-1502925)\n* [South Korea warns of second wave](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-southkorea-idUSKBN22M028)\n* [Canada warns against reopening incorrectly](https://www.businessinsider.com/trudeau-reopening-could-send-canada-back-into-confinement-2020-5)\n* [Dr. Fauci warns Congress of reopening risks](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/12/dr-anthony-fauci-testifies-before-congress-on-coronavirus-heres-what-he-says.html)\n* [Grocery costs jump most in 46 years](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/05/12/us-grocery-costs-jump-the-most-in-46-years-led-by-rising-prices-for-meat-and-eggs.html?__twitter_impression=true)\n* [Senator Graham introduces bill to sanction China](https://twitter.com/FirstSquawk/status/1260259253593366528?s=19)\n* [Investors follow FED to bonds](https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2020-05-12/the-fed-is-all-set-to-turbocharge-credit-as-billions-flee-stocks)\n* [Apple has it's own wedge](https://twitter.com/kc_swing/status/1260361839038230528?s=09)\n* [China could target Apple / Boeing in retalliation](https://www.fool.com/amp/investing/2020/05/15/dow-jones-news-china-could-target-apple-boeing-sto.aspx)\n* [China asks US to stop unreasonable suppression of Huwei](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-huawei-tech/china-asks-united-states-to-stop-unreasonable-suppression-of-huawei-idUSKBN22S0DE)\n* [FED's Kashkari say V shape recover is off](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/a-v-shaped-recovery-is-off-the-table-feds-kashkari-says-2020-05-14)\n* [Cash position is surging in retail and institutions](https://twitter.com/topdowncharts/status/1261003785888886784?s=19)\n* [GDP could decline 42% in second quarter according to ATL Fed](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/15/gdp-could-decline-by-42percent-in-the-second-quarter-according-to-the-atlanta-fed.html)\n* [Worse than expected drop in retail sales](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/15/us-retail-sales-drop-weighs-on-stocks-what-to-watch-now.html)\n* [Overseas investors sell $300b in Treasuries as dollar demand soars](https://www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/guid/862B98FA-22FA-4D49-97BF-6CA19D6A0B21)\n* [FED warns about asset price risk if pandemic grows](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-15/fed-warns-of-significant-hit-to-asset-prices-if-pandemic-grows)\n* [Speculation on dollar losing reserve currency status](https://www.kitco.com/commentaries/2020-05-14/The-US-dollar-the-final-act.html)\n* [Goldman wars QE not enough for bonds](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-15/goldman-warns-central-bank-qe-not-enough-for-avalanche-of-bonds)\n* [S&P may delist record number of companies](https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2020-05-16/drastic-makeover-looms-for-world-s-most-followed-stock-index)\n* [Stanley Drunkenmiller gets bearish](https://youtu.be/wKwoMuB2Tck)\n\nLet's take a look at a few numbers that highlight the Treasury's spending, the Fed's role in buying that debt, and how that impacted the market.\n\n**Treasury:**\n\n* Q1 (Jan / Feb / Mar) : Borrowed $477 billion please (\\~37 billion a week)\n* Q2 (Apr / May / Jun) : Borrowed $3,000,000,000,000 or 3 trillion (\\~231 billion a week)\n\n**Federal Reserve:**\n\n* Q1 : Bought \\~200+ billion in treasuries, with most of that in March (\\~42% of money Treasury raised)\n* Q2 : Seems to be headed to around \\~1.5 trillion in treasury purchases, with most of that in April (\\~50% of money Treasury is raising)\n\n**Stock Market (Fed Spend : ES +/-):**\n\n* 2/24 - 9b (-11.63%)\n* 3/2 - 22b (+0.44%)\n* 3/9 - 29b (-9.45%)\n* 3/16 - 20b (-14.74%)\n* 3/23 - 118b (+10.29%)\n* 3/30 - 338b (-1.63%) (Bull Flag)\n* 4/6 - 362b (+11.96%)\n* 4/13 - 294b (+3.25%)\n* 4/20 - 154b (-1.41%)\n* 4/27 - 120b (-0.27%)\n* 5/4 - 62b (+3.78%)\n* 5/11 - 49b (-2.8%)\n\n# The Point:\n\nThere's a couple points to make here:\n\n1. The Fed stepped in and was presumably buying up around 75% of the money the treasury needed to raise come March.  The Treasury then needed a lot more money, and the FED came in to buy.  The FED is now ramping down purchases, tapering, expecting the market to come back to the table.\n2. If the FED isn't buying, someone has to, and that someone needs dollars.  The FED's already bought about half of what the Treasury needed, but there is still likely around another $1 trillion dollars in treasuries that will be flooded into the market the remainder of May and June.\n3. Dollars are still in short supply, there are pressures on availability of dollars from many angles, adding an additional $1 trillion to the demand side of the equation will be felt.\n4. The market has been directly correlated with this injection, it's a likely loser as dollars rotate positions.  No guarantees as I can't see the full data, and am making inferences, but it's a guaranteed headwind to recovery.\n\n**Some TA:**\n\nLet's first apply this to a chart, it's fairly striking how it's impacted our channels on ES or SPY on a 3 month 1 hour chart:\n\n[Buys Up, Taper Down](https://preview.redd.it/olixo58ffcz41.png?width=1819&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a35e7f184529903d9a65bbbb0f447db03eaf2a9)\n\nZerohedge, where you need a grain of salt to enter, [had a point I found held water](https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/goldman-spots-huge-problem-fed).  Congress is likely to pass a stimulus, whatever ends up in it, it seems to be trending towards 3 trillion, at which point the Treasury would likely need to ramp selling to a point that exceeds the last two quarters.  The FED would likely need a catalyst to re-enter purchasing to that extent, and the catalyst is most likely to be another liquidity crisis, another equities crash, and another massive round of QE.\n\n[Latest active wedge](https://preview.redd.it/lffr289jjcz41.png?width=1550&format=png&auto=webp&s=5da0c87ebfb52bfaa515308b8a42a8a57fec60d9)\n\nThere's a wedge I've been watching form off around a weak head and shoulders pattern.  The wedge matches the top line of our falling channel, it also wedges right into the chop zone of our overall channel (purple lines).  Any single channel or indicator is fairly unreliable, but there are a lot of signs converging that suggest we're going to trade sideways this coming week in a range that sees highs of 293 descending to 291.5 and lows starting around 279 and rising to 283.  \n\nWe rarely make it to the end of the wedge, and I'd expect us to break this one in the back half of this week or the first half of next week.  The first liquidity crisis had an initial drop around 15%, followed by a week bull trap, and race to the bottom.  \n\n# Guesswork\n\n[How deep does this rabbit hole go?](https://preview.redd.it/uikxpmo1lcz41.png?width=1552&format=png&auto=webp&s=c51ff7b63f4288f0eddbd5e00368bd6318218ea6)\n\nThe following is not something I'm actively trading, you shouldn't either, yet.  I'll look on Monday and try to decide if I'm leaning up or down at open, currently leaning up.  As we break wedge, I don't think our initial drop this time would be as severe as last and testing the bottom of channel (purple) makes sense at a high level.  In theory, assuming a liquidity crisis is forming, you could easily see a repeat bull trap and subsequent plunge, but that's guessing on a catalyst that hasn't yet arrived.\n\nEnough for now.  I'll add updates here as the week moves on for anyone who wants to follow along.  If I opt to enter another long term play, I'll create a unique post to track that specifically.
