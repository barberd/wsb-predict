Last week, I'm sittin here thinking \"How is Yelp even alive right now?\" Then I check market cap and see its only 2 billion dollars. Household name, we've all used it, and its sittin at 2bil.  \n\nThen Im cruising LinkedIn and in between all the \"Im a good person because I helped a homeless person\" and \"I'm the best person ever and you could be just like me posts. Agree?\" posts, I see this gem.  \n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2019/09/02/facebook-stock-will-benefit-if-the-company-pays-6-billion-to-acquire-yelp/#4fabfea82d94](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2019/09/02/facebook-stock-will-benefit-if-the-company-pays-6-billion-to-acquire-yelp/#4fabfea82d94)  \n\n\nI'm thinking \"Oh that makes sense, FB acquiring Yelp.\" Then I read it and its literally just some bruh talking about why they should acquire Yelp, not that they're actually acquiring yelp.  \n\nBut theoretically, if Facebook or someone \\_did\\_ acquire Yelp. Even for half that at $4bil, and you had some long Yelp positions. Itd be straight rainin tendies.  \n\nAnd Yelp, although bleeding, their stock price has barely moved in like 4 years, so its not like youre buying in on a tanking company, just a stagnant one.    \n\n\nWhats the general consensus here?", "created_utc": 1568071216, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d1yyrq/long_yelp_potential_acquisition/", "is_self": true}
