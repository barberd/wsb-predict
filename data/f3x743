{"id": "f3x743", "title": "Aggressive Option Flow (02-14-20) - SPCE/MSFT/NVDA/PYPL", "selftext": "Today  I included the aggressive orders that I see, many of them instead of  just a few into one picture. Today I didn't color code the calls/puts   but did color code the companies.\n\nThese  options orders are on or above the ask. Many have the same expiry and  strike. Also lots of the orders were sweeps so these ppl were breaking  down their order to get filled faster.\n\nAlso all these orders volume of the contracts exceeded the open interest in  multiple trades so it's most likely not closing positions. Either buy to  open orders or sell to open orders and based on the aggressiveness of  the orders one can infer its buy to open. Some of these may be hedges  and some most likely not.\n\nData is here - [https://ibb.co/rKjZXD8](https://ibb.co/rKjZXD8)\n\nIt's from 9:30-2:08pm or so.\n\nWatch NVDA to maybe to to 300 soon, watch DB/SPCE/MSFT/PYPL, all those look really aggressive.\n\nI  will say this, don't just enter into positions based on this data alone in most cases. Use  technicals/fundamentals/options  data-flow/market  sediment all combined  instead of just 1 of these. Use protection like  spreads if you worry  about losing what u put in and be  smart,  understand the risks of putting  $ into weekly expiry's, consider a  longer expiry.", "created_utc": 1581708026, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3x743/aggressive_option_flow_021420_spcemsftnvdapypl/", "is_self": true}
