Proof of positions\u2014\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/ZSmD9tD\n\nWhy?\n\n1. Listen to their latest earnings call and tell me otherwise \u2014 [Link to Earnings Call](https://ir.expediagroup.com/events/event-details/expedia-group-fourth-quarter-2019-earnings-conference-call)\n\n2. They fired their whole management team which is why it dipped from $140ish a few months ago and things are better now than they were when it was trading around $140\n\n3. Barry Diller is running the company now and after listening to the earnings call I concluded that Barry is the man that will take this to the moon\n\n4. They guided double digit EBITDA growth even after taking into consideration impacts of virus\n\n5. Chairman Barry Diller and Vice Chairman Peter Kern LOADED up on shares\n\n6. On the earnings call they literally said they believe the stonk is significantly undervalued and that they will use any cash flow they have to buy back shares \n\n7. They said the prior management team made the company \u201cfat\u201d and that they expect $300-$500 million in cost savings \n\n8. Based on the best comp $BKNG and the multiples it\u2019s trading at $EXPE has at least 50%-75% to run IMO to get to same valuation levels. $BKNG NTM EBITDA multiple is 14x. $EXPE is 8x.\n\n9. It\u2019s significantly lagging the S&amp;P over past year\n\n10. Coronavirus fear has beat this down as well and that fear will fade\n\n11. Economy good means people will travel more \n\n12. Potential acquisition candidate at these low valuations levels (jackpot scenario)\n\n13.  Call premiums are cheap right now\n\n14. Barry Diller is the man and I\u2019m riding this thing with him.\n\nWish me luck autists.", "created_utc": 1582133324, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6e1gj/expe_is_due_for_msft_type_run/", "is_self": true}
