{"id": "ghpxxn", "title": "DD from 5/9-5/11, Okta, Cardlytics, and Guidance, TLDR and Plays included", "selftext": "Welcome back to the WSB DD Summary! This is for 5/9-5/11. I\u2019m your host and resident autist u/expander2. You have to be able to read to gain anything from this so that rules out about half of you. As always, ticker is in bold on the left and what I deem \"important\" is near the top of the post. A TLDR, plays, and previous DD summaries will be at the bottom. My last posts still stand and hold some good info so check it out for more plays if this isn't enough for you greedy fucks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot much good stuff for this weekend. Just watching the DD from Friday seeing how it pans out. We will get right into a couple plays but this one doesn't have many plays.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**OKTA;**  Okay, Okta is another cloud company. Straight from Wikipedia it; \n\n>...provides cloud software that helps companies manage and secure user authentication into modern applications, and for developers to build identity controls into applications, website web services and devices.\n\nThis means that they can make lots of money when everyone is working at home and overhauling their network because of the increased web traffic. This equates into more growth for an already growing company. I'm just gonna copy and paste the important shit [from this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gez830/why_okta_is_a_solid_play/) which gives you everything you need to make a decision.\n\n>Financial performance has been truly outstanding in recent years, with revenue growth reaching 54% annually since 2017. Management comments during the company's investor day on April 1 confirmed that the business keeps firing on all cylinders based on recent data, and several research firms increased their price targets for Okta after the conference.  \n>  \n>Most high-growth companies in the sector are losing money due to aggressive reinvestment needs to support long-term growth. Okta, on the other hand, is already generating positive free cash flows, and management has ambitious targets over the middle term.  \n>  \n>Okta intends to deliver revenue growth rates in the range of 30% to 35% over the next five years and a free cash flow margin of 20-25% in fiscal 2024. These targets are not easy to achieve, but they are not unrealistic either when considering the company's track record and future opportunities.  \n>  \n>Total revenue last quarter reached $167.3 million, an increase of 45% year over year. Subscription revenue was $158.5 million, an increase of 46%. Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO) reached $1.21 billion, growing by 66% year over year.\n\nEarnings come out 5/28 and should be a beat. I don't plan on entering this myself but I will absolutely look into it again next week and make a firm decision by then. I will update in one of my posts that week what I will do with Okta.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CDLX;**  Cardlytics is a company that provides a marketing channel inside apps like Wells Fargo & Bank of America, through consumer cash-back deals. For the retards, they put ads in banking apps with discounts so that people are likely to buy them. As we know, people are spending a shit ton of money online. Amazon, Shopify, Etsy, etc. are all making money hand over fist because of our consumer culture. People are spending money and this is good for any company that advertises deals. Here is what is interesting and the reason I might buy into this, according to the [OP of this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gg0jz7/cardlytics_nyse_cdlx_preearnings_call_next_monday/), before covid most of the ads in these banking apps were for airlines, cruises, theme parks; attractions. Now, most of these ads are for clothing deals, carryout, amazon, movies. This means they have successfully flipped their market to generate maximum profit from consumer trends in the wake of a quarantine. If this is true then it is brilliant. Another indicator of performance is the fact that Cardlytics insiders have been buying into their company to the point of spending around $33 million to buy shares of their own company. \n\nIf I had the liquidity to buy in, I would. Earnings release after hours today and I can see them reaching above $50 easily. I'm tied up right now but if I would have seen this earlier I would be in. Do your own research though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Guidance;**  If you have SmileDirectClub (SDC) calls then I would sell today, this is if you bought them because of my post on Friday. This run-up is indicative of a massive sell off after earnings no matter if they are good or not. If you got the $8.5 then you are a wealthy man. Don't be greedy. Wish I would have bought it on Friday last week. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My moves;**  Because of popular demand and as a credibility enhancer, I have decided to include my moves in regards to the stocks that I write about. This will include things from past DD summaries and ongoing trades. Most of them will not be this long and will only include my moves not an explanation but because this is the first I will include that stuff and more.\n\nToday (5/11) I bought CSCO $45.5c 5/15 and LOGI $60c 5/15 because both are down today and report earning very soon. Both were in my last DD summary so read that for more information on why. I plan to use the earnings from both of those plays to get in on BOX and carry over into next week. I also have some SATS calls that I am still trying to offload. I made quite a bit on SATS $35c so I used a small percentage of my profits to buy back in at $40 and lost that money but I\u2019m not hurt over that. \n\nI have a project going on with another user which will help find the perfect options contract to make a reasonable amount of money based on the smallest moves in underlying price. It is in its testing phases right now but we plan to use it next week for ourselves to see how well it works then I will look into releasing some of that information to you guys. That's all I can really say about it but know that it's taking up a bit of my time because of research and implementation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck fuckers and tune in on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for more WSB DD Summaries!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR;** Okta could make big bucks I will update on that one, Cardlytics will get above $50, Sell SmileDirectClub calls today.\n\n**Plays;** OKTA calls for 6/5 (but dont buy yet), CDLX calls above $50 for 5/15 and buy today because they report after hours. \n\n**Previous WSB DD Summaries;**[ 4/28-5/1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gby6ez/dd_from_42851_match_alphabet_and_a_reminder_tldr/), [5/2-5/4](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gdkvqf/dd_from_5254_zillow_next_leg_down_oil_reminder/),[ 5/5-5/8](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gfxy98/dd_from_5558_cisco_logitech_box_and_smiledirect/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDISCLAIMER; I am not personally advocating for any play that I add to this list. I merely go through a couple of days of posts and find what I think is competent DD.
