I now realize the coronavirus is far less deadly than I thought previously. \n\nI was panicking about the Covid19 because the virus had a initial death rate of 2% in China. It looks like the death rate was going to skyrocket due to the lagging effect. SARS had a initial death rate of 3% and ended up being 10% in reality. This virus was far more virulant with a R0 of 4-5, so spreading at 2-3 exponent higher rate than SARs. Basically I thought this was the apocalypse and that the world economy was going to end. \n\nNow i think by watching both the data coming from the diamond princess as well as Korea. I think what happened is that the number of death is pretty accurate, but far more people actually have the virus than is tested for. The death princess had 3500 on board, 700 tested positive and 5 dead. I think the reality is probably that like 1000-1500 had it, and that puts the death rate at 0.5%. Korea started aggressive testing to contain its spread and they found 2,000 cases relative to 22 deaths, so a death rate of 1% and falling. Further proof of this is looking a singapore, which has a great healthcare system, about 100 infected and 0 deaths. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think as we continue to watch the diamond princess we'll find that the real death rare is somewhere around 0.4-0.7%. For comparison, the seasonal flu is about 0.1% mortality so Trump would be right to compare this against a really bad more contagious flu. So yes there could be some short term impacts to the economy from people panicking but it is no where close to the world ending scenario I had imagined. \n\nTLDR: stonks only go up.", "created_utc": 1583165005, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fce6wb/coronavirus_is_overstated_previous_bear_who/", "is_self": true}
