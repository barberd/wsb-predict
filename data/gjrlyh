I found that Smartsheets is reporting earnings June 3rd, and their stock has not increased to the level we've seen other tech companies rise in the past few weeks (read: not priced in). Their Q1 earnings report also includes April, so the influx of people using Smartsheets due to COVID will show up on earnings and growth.\n\nTheir fundamentals are solid - they're still a growth stock, but they have a lot of runway. They've also been doing the \"growth\" part incredibly well, with 90% of the S&P500 as paying customers. If you look at the options volume for June 19th, calls vastly outweigh puts by *90%*, suggesting some early birds are seeing potential here (or insiders!).\n\nIntuitively, it's a great stock. If you were Manager Joe in the office yesterday, you could walk over to your underlings' desks to lay down a deadline for a report next week. Now that everyone's been stuck at home, you've gotta send a fancy official-looking spreadsheet and make them believe that the glorified Excel formula means they've gotta get you a report in a week. Anecdotally, every company I've ever worked at or interviewed with has introduced Smartsheets fairly recently.\n\nSMAR 06/19 55C, SMAR 06/19 50C", "created_utc": 1589479682.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gjrlyh/a_promising_options_trade_smartsheet/", "is_self": true}
