Analysts have been preaching doom and gloom for a year+ now and yet it's doubled in price since early 2018. This is even accounting for a big slide in the last month (when the founder sold a lot of shares). More slides coming as the stock corrects back to where it should be?\n\nMy DD: I grew up drinking this beer in college and after and man has it gone downhill in the last year. The mix packs used to offer six high-quality beers of different variety every season. Now they recycle the same crap and have switched to only four beers in a mix pack. I also rarely seem to see them here in SF, but that's partially because Lagunitas and Sierra Nevada have cornered the market. \n\nWhat's coming up the barrel for $SAM?", "created_utc": 1568864791, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d68jlc/sam_adams_discussion/", "is_self": true}
