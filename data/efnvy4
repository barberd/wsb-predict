{"id": "efnvy4", "title": "Trades for Next Week (Dec 30th-Jan 3rd)", "selftext": "Hey WSB, this is my first DD thread. I\u2019ve been meaning to compile one for awhile, but it takes a lot of time and effort to type everything out. For some background, I\u2019ve been on this sub for a few years. A friend jokingly recommended it as a form of entertainment in high school. Through it, I was introduced to options trading when I was eighteen. I\u2019m now an honors economics major in college with an emphasis in finance. I owe my interest in economics and financial markets in part to r/wallstreetbets and this is my way of giving back. Helping you all gain tendies is my objective. I trade purely on trend and technical analysis and I finished the last year with gains a little north of 110%. I\u2019ll be on vacation next week so I\u2019ll have had limited time to trade (hence why I\u2019m posting on Wednesday night) but I\u2019d like to share the three best trades I\u2019ve come across for next week. \n\n\n1/3/2020 $160 MSFT Calls @ $0.37\nWhenever anyone asks what stock they should buy, my simple answer is Microsoft. They\u2019ve got so much going for them. Limited China exposure, a global market, rising market share in cloud computing, yada yada yada. Microsoft has been consolidating at $157 for the last three days and is primed for a breakout once it breaks $158. I always kick myself for finding Microsoft plays and not acting on them. A 2% move after this period of consolidation is perfectly in reason for this beast. \n\n\n1/3/2020 $150 ROKU Calls @ $3.00\nYou all know Roku. It always trades the same until it doesn\u2019t. Recently it was affected by the departure of a high ranking employee, but based on the consolidation last week and the uptrend we saw Tuesday, the market seems to have digested the news. When Roku moves, it moves hard. I don\u2019t want to miss out on this one.\n\n\n1/3/2020 $30.5 WPM Calls @ $0.20\nWheaton Precious Metals is a Canadian mining company that focuses on, but not limited to, Gold, Silver, and Palladium. Disclosure: I\u2019ve been in this trade for the last week so I\u2019m biased, but I\u2019m bullish on Palladium and Gold in particular in the short term. A 3% move in the next week and a half wouldn\u2019t be surprising considering Palladium\u2019s recent consolidation. Gold also recently broke $1,500 for the first time in three months. This is definitely my underdog value trade of the week considering the multiple bullish factors it has going for it.\n\n\nOther trades I\u2019m bullish on in the short term: SHOP, SBUX, AAPL, and QCOM.\n\n\nIf you guys like this thread, I\u2019ll try to make it an every Saturday/Sunday thing. Feel free to DM me any specific questions you may have and I\u2019ll try to answer them. Otherwise, leave them in the comments. \n\n\nOther thoughts: I\u2019ve got a few bearish picks, but I\u2019ve chosen not to include them on this DD thread. Puts haven\u2019t been the play since August.\n\n\nDisclosure: This is not financial advice. These are my thoughts alone, and I am not liable for negative financial outcomes.
