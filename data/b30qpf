{"id": "b30qpf", "title": "My DD on CBD - Long AMRS", "selftext": "First off - a disclaimer: I don't smoke weed, never liked it much. I don't care about CBD myself, but I live in Colorado, and I see people putting that shit in EVERYTHING. Ice cream? CBD. Soda? CBD. Shampoo? CBD. Dog treats? CBD. Massage oil? CBD. Supplements that will cure every illness and make you a pro trader? CBD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow CBD is expensive. It's a molecule that is found in small quantities in weed/hemp. So you need to grow a bunch of expensive plants, extract, purify, and you only get a little bit of CBD of questionable purity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLuckily, CBD is A FUCKING [TERPENE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terpene). And my boys (and girls) over at Amyris (AMRS) have spent over a billion dollars genetically programming yeast, so that when it ferments, instead of delicious brewski, it makes any terpene. They are the only company who can do it reliably, and have scaled 8 different molecules so far. So for them the production process is fairly simple - throw a bunch of cheap-ass sugar cane in a large tank, add some magic yeast and watch it shit out expensive chemicals at an incredible purity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, as recently as yesterday, they [got](http://investors.amyris.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amyris-finalizes-cannabinoid-development-licensing-and) a $300M R&amp;D contract to make their yeast shit out CBD (they will also get a % of sales when they actually ship product). By my estimates it will cost them about $50M. The first CBD products made with their yeast are to launch in early 2020. BOOM, SHAKALAKA.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, Amyris also makes a bunch of other useful stuff. Best skin moisturizer ever, squalane. Best zero-calorie sweetener ever, Reb M. They have the fastest growing skincare brand in the US. They are launching infant formula, gross as that is, and baby skincare to dethrone the JNJ fuckups who put fucking ASBESTOS on babies and yet own the baby skin care market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe problem with Amyris, is that their balance sheet is GARBAGE. It took them a long time to get to where they are and they have $200M in debt. Some of it they will pay by BIG POPPA DSM buying their Vitamin E business next month. But I expect that they will have to issue some shares too. That's where CBD comes in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen CBD bros discover that there is a company in the sector, which isn't a  bunch of dirty hippies listed in Canada, but an actual MOTHERFUCKING technology company they will shit their pants, buy AMRS, and the company can address their debt with little dilution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReasons for WTB to be in AMRS:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Quality memes. Yelling YEAST MODE when the stock goes up is legit fun.\n* CBD, dude, like yeah.\n* It's the Apple of biology.\n* It will fuck you in the ass whether you are long or short.\n* Bill Gates owns shares, John Doerr is on the fucking board and is one of the largest shareholders, other big dick people in it whom I can't disclose.\n\nNumbers for the old schoolers who are into that stupid shit:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2018 Rev $80M\n\n2019 Rev expected $150M\n\nMarket cap $296M (though if you dillute it to what I expect it to be diluted to, it's more like $480M)\n\n2018 loss $120M\n\n2019 - who the hell knows, who cares about making money anyway?", "created_utc": 1553018939, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b30qpf/my_dd_on_cbd_long_amrs/", "is_self": true}
