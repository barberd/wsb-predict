{"id": "faw5a3", "title": "$MMM could have a jump", "selftext": "It is pretty obvious now that the beer flu will be affecting the US. We have all been waiting to see the first couple reports to pop up here and the time is now. It\u2019s common knowledge around reddit that N95 mask have been sold out through vendors and price gouging has been happening for weeks now. 3M produces the majority of N95 masks for the US and has been ramping up production of these masks over the past month. Their Q1 earnings call is set to happen on 4/28, and I could only assume they will beat earnings and will have nothing but positivity to spread for their impact on fighting off the beer flu. ATH is 219.75 and is currently trading at 151. $Lake just shot up +50% and I can see the same happening for 3M. They have manufacturing plants all over the world so they won\u2019t be fully affected by the supply disruption and even if the shares don\u2019t go to the moon, it won\u2019t be scuba diving in 2020 unless the beer flu mutates into the everclear knocked the fuck out turned zombie flu that wipes out the world.\n3M has been posted here but with recent reports of the virus in the US I was curious. Of course the 3M N95 masks contribute to a small portion of the company but you never really know til it happens.\n\nTDLR: inverse me to make money. However this is not a suggestion nor is it good financial advice.
