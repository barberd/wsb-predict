{"id": "dluk3u", "title": "TastyWorks $100 Challenge with free plays &amp; NEW website !", "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Started today October 21, 2019 with $101 in my account.](https://i.redd.it/rpxas0zkw7u31.png)\n\nI'm going to pursue a challenge to get this account to $1000 by the end of the year! I will be up uploading my plays daily along with my account value. Also if anyone has any tips about tastyworks or a better way to view portfolio positions, it may be helpful for further posts. Thanks!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#                                                              TRADE #1\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**$SIX(Six Flags Corp)** earnings were announced after hours today which is the main reason I choose this to be my first play. I needed to gain some more capital in the account to make further trades later in the week given I only have $100 to work with. \n\n So I went all in on the **Nov 15 $47.5 puts which I was able to get 1 contract at $0.70.** *( If you are unfamiliar with options the price of a contract is multiplied by x100 making the total cost of the trade $70 which Is 70% of the total account. )* \n\nBy the end of the day the put had **gained $0.25** in value **closing @ $0.95 per contract, w**hich you can see in *picture #1* above for **P/L DAY**. In after hours, **$SIX** **share** price had dropped to a low of $47.75 and if it holds this level tomorrow at open the position, it should be worth around $220 ! *See below in picture #2 !*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Options calculator projected value of trade.](https://i.redd.it/75oxzwl708u31.png)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#                                                      TastyWorks Position\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Nov 15 $47.5 put on $SIX](https://i.redd.it/3zu8m2wf08u31.png)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo lock in gains, I will be closing this out tomorrow at open so that I am able to make a few trades so stay tuned for more opportunities!\n\nI will post tomorrow around 7:30pm on the realized gain and further positions for the week once I get out of school &amp; I'm off of work.
