{"id": "frvza9", "title": "$NFLX Short Thesis", "selftext": "Waddup gay bears??  Want some dd for your limp dick pps?\n\nDisclaimer:  Short position on NFLX.  Not your financial adviser.\n\nI know most of you sheep will see the title and think \"Durrr, everyone's at home with nothing to do, what else are we supposed to do besides watch Netflix.\"  Well, here's the thing...Netflix doesn't make any more money on more people watching and actually has to pay more to those cloud tech nerds to take up space on their servers: their revenue is based strictly off subscribers.  I expect gross margin to be lower because of this.\n\nNetflix has grown revenues about 25-35% the last few years, which I admit is impressive to say the least.  At this point, the US/Canada market has become saturated though with 67 million subscribers but they only grew by 5% last year, accounting for about 50% of the firm's revenue.  Subscriber growth is much higher elsewhere...EMEA grew 37%, Latin America 20%, and Asia/Pacific 53%.  Impressive stuff.\n\nHowever, unemployment is going to be high across the world and I expect to see consolidation or cancelling of their subscriptions, or at the very least much slower growth and even with slower subscriber growth they can't easily offset that by increasing prices because of the increase in steaming competition.  Additionally, Karen's across the US are going ape shit crazy having to watch their kids all day and instead of watching Marriage Story for the 12th time they're going to decide to pick up Disney+ so that little Timmy and Sarah can get even more retarded by watching Phineus and Ferb.\n\nOk, so far we have a thesis for lower revenue growth and lower margins, but here's the best part...Netflix doesn't make any fucking money!!  No cash flow!! They're literally like the anti-fed.  You fuggers are like \"Look at their income statement, it's green!\".  Ok yeah but that's because everything they pay up front for tv show and movie rights is capitalized as an intangible asset.  Look at their cash flow statement...they're losing more and more cash for every dollar of revenue because they have to keep paying more for tv shows due to increased competition from rivals and networks realizing they were getting ripped off.  Every year they sell off more shares and increase their debt levels but nobody bats an eye.\n\nThe shares are trading near ATH and share price has been unaffected from China Flu because everyone thinks that their service is uncyclical.  In the next quarter or two I think we're going to see a drop in their growth and a correction more towards fundamentals which is at $200 IMO.", "created_utc": 1585592074.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frvza9/nflx_short_thesis/", "is_self": true}
