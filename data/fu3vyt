So weird that there\u2019s really no way to know what is going to happen with the stock market, the economy, or even the dollar. Because of this weirdness and uncertainty, you can\u2019t afford to not buy GLD 200+ 6/19 calls. Let me explain.\n\nWith so much uncertainty in the world and in the financial markets, it is not outside the realm of possibility that the US could soon switch to a gold-backed currency. It makes sense when you analyze what\u2019s going on behind the scenes and between the lines. I don\u2019t care to write up a full analysis of my position, but there are several indicators that this may happen in the next 60 days. Judy Shelton, Trump's use of the ESF through the Treasury, the odd declaration of war on drugs, the possible coronahoax, and several other pieces to the puzzle are worth researching for yourself. Anyway, if we do switch to a gold standard you can expect the value of GLD (and other gold/precious metal-related stocks/ETFs) to go to the moon. Due to the high strike price, you can get in on what could be an enormous payday for a really low price. If we make the switch, the strike price will be irrelevant and easily eclipsed.\n\nFor example, say you buy 10 GLD $215 calls at .50 for $500. If the price of GLD doubles to $300 (an extremely conservative estimate for the gold standard) you would make $84,500 in profit. A more reasonable estimate would have GLD at $1,000. This would leave you with a profit of $784,500 on a $500 investment. A higher-end estimate with GLD at $5,000 gives a profit of $4.75 million on a $500 investment. Some analysts even predict a revaluation of gold at $100,000 per ounce and let\u2019s say GLD goes to $10,000 as a result (an extreme example), the profit would be $9.78 million. The potential upside is huge and well worth the small amount of risk involved.\n\nThere will be plenty of naysayers coming along to shit on the idea of a switch to a gold standard, but if you have a little cash available to make this bet, can you really afford not to have some skin in the game? Look around at what\u2019s happening in the world. This switch is not outside of the realm of possibility, no matter what anyone tries to tell you. Don\u2019t be left out in the cold with what might be your biggest regret, ever.\n\nFor the record, I'm holding high strike 6/19 calls for GLD, GDX, NUGT, JDST, JNUG, and GOLD so that I'm diversified in the event of a bank failure or other issue. (screenshot added)\n\nThis post is not an attempt to unload any options or to manipulate the price. I'm riding this out until 6/19. You can call me crazy, but I prefer hyper-sane.  ;)\n\nYou\u2019re welcome. See you in June.\n\nEdit: Spelling and added screenshot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b8yvy0u2hmq41.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=53306c38275204e9a97dd698a3a4f645981a45a6", "created_utc": 1585898593.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fu3vyt/poor_mans_yolowhy_you_cant_afford_to_not_buy_gld/", "is_self": true}
