But unless something new and bad happens that we don't already know about the market will go up from here.**\n\n**I have short positions for 4/17 (SPX 2000, IWM 100) that I will be closing tomorrow, and I will be adding to my long positions with 2022 LEAPS on tech stocks. (Disclaimer: Unless we get some news overnight that brings new unknowns - like China starting a war or something).**\n___\n\nThis is my attempt at having a discussion on where the market is heading based on what we actually know, and not what we think might happen. My argument for why the market is headed higher will be based on a few points that, hopefully we can all agree on.\n\nWe all know the market doesn't act rationally, but sometimes we forget the reason why it doesn't act rationally is because the market moves based on fear and greed: The more fear we see in the system the more selling we see, the more greed we see in the system the more buying we see.\n\n* The only thing that the market is afraid of is the unknown - \"what will my position be worth in the future?\"\n* Bad events, do not directly cause fear in the market, it's only the uncertainty of what those events can lead to that cause fear in the markets.\n* Greed is less powerful of a motivator than fear, but it's still a strong motivator.\n* The market knows that in the long term, buying the dip will make you a lot of money\n\nSo, when we want to determine whether the market will go up or down, we should ask ourselves two questions:\n\n1.) Do market participants have reason to believe that buying now will benefit them in the long run\n2.) Do market participants have anything to fear that they don't already know about\n---\n\nLet's tackle #1 first. The answer to this is unequivocally yes. In 1929 when the stock market crashed, people didn't have over 100 years of stock market history to look back on and see that long term trends always point up. The US was also not the global superpower that it is today. There was genuine fear then that the US economy would collapse and all stocks would be worthless. The 80% decline we saw in the US market will only ever happen again if there is reason to believe that the US economy simply won't exist next year. I'm talking meteors, alien invasion, WWIII, zombie apocalypse, etc.\n\nIn 2008 when US markets dropped by 55% there was genuine concern that the world economy would collapse under the weight of the global financial system collapsing around them. However, despite those fears, we didn't drop as far as we did in the 1929 bear market. Why? History told market participants that the market eventually goes up, and if you can stomach the drops you'll be rewarded, aka buy the dip. \n\nNow 11 years later, people are looking at the 30-ish percent we've fallen and thinking \"yeah, I'm gonna buy this dip and get rich, because even if it drops 50% like it did in 2008, I'll still make money when it goes back up\". \n\n---\n\nNow for #2. What should market participants fear that they don't already know about? Well we can't really answer that question, because we don't know what we don't know. But we can talk about a few of the \"known\" fears.\n\n* Covid-19: We passed 1MM cases and 50k deaths today. That's a lot. It's going to get worse. We all know that. At this point, everyone has done the math in their heads, they've all played out the worst case scenarios where 100% of the world is infected and 10% of the world population dies. That's 770 million people dead. And yet, because we know it's a possibility, there's no unknown here. Is there something to fear? Sure, but nothing that we can't deal with if it gets that bad.\n\n* Economic downturn: So we all know that Covid-19 means people are staying home from work. That means less consumption, which decreases demand, that will cause decreased supply, and the already decreased supply from shuttered factories will drive up the cost of goods, which will create a compounding effect where people have less money to spend and goods cost more to purchase. But, we also know that world governments know about this problem. Central banks have shown that they're willing to spend unreal amounts of money on this problem. They'll give you unemployment checks to counteract your lost wage, and they'll give businesses interest free loans to counteract their lost business. It's a problem, but it's one we're dealing with. There's a question of \"how bad will it get\", but as long as we know that JPow and the FED will be there with the money printers, we can sleep okay at night knowing it won't get French Revolution bad.\n\n* Oil Prices: This really belongs in the 2nd bullet point. Any issues with oil pricing is entirely human made, and we can resolve it through diplomacy. \n\n___\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSo where does this leave us on the ol' fear-vs-greed-o-meter? Well, that question can only be answered by you, but from what I can see, the market is consistently shrugging off bad economic news, shrugging off coronavirus news, and as we can see from Trump's Fake News Tweet today, is primed to skyrocket on even the hint of good news. What happens when we DO have a resolution on oil prices? We know a vaccine is coming, what happens when we have an announcement of a date that a vaccine will be available?\n\nAlso, at this point the market is just a game of Billionaire Circle-Jerk. We could all be dead from the coronavirus and SPY would be at $200 with literally just 2 hedge funds trading back and forth with each other because it's all fake anyway.\n\nI'm not saying that we won't go lower, I'm saying that unless we get something NEW (i.e. not coronavirus, not economy is fucked because coronavirus, not economy is fucked because oil), we've likely already bottomed out for 2020.", "created_utc": 1585861858.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ftunlw/dont_marry_your_positions_the_market_isnt_rational/", "is_self": true}
