Later it turned it into iron condor by adding 309/308 bull put spread.\n\n\nToday was really crazy day especially the power hour but made +6k\n\nWas expected to make 7.5k ish but for some reason IB bought back my short options \ud83e\udd2c\ud83d\ude21. Really pissed at them. Made me lose 1.5k\n\nBut overall I am grateful!\n\nPS : I wanted to show up proper screenshots just like I did last week but IB fked up everything and showing absurd info in the positions section.\n\nAnyways you can verify realized - unrealized = 6k euros\n\n[Screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/5Lb9rdM)", "created_utc": 1575667725, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e74uy5/weekly_paychecks_getting_fatter_and_fatter_i_am/", "is_self": true}
