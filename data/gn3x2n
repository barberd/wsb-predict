But u/formerbuck made a big DD the other day, and garnered a significant amount of followers.  I only went as far as to follow his post, and try to see if his angle was correct.  It was not, and he has proceeded to delete his entire post, and comment history.  I don't know that he was mean spirited and purposefully wanted people to follow him in to the ditch, but I know he took a few people down with him.\n\nWatch who you follow, and trust.  In fact don't trust anyone here, in fact if you have any less a clue than I of what you are doing, just stop.  Or don't, it's on you tho.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: grammar and syntax", "created_utc": 1589945770.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gn3x2n/watch_out_for_people_like_uformerbuck/", "is_self": true}
