{"id": "h7bzfu", "title": "Trading away gains", "selftext": "In the past 2 weeks, I\u2019ve traded myself out of huge wins, costing myself probably 15k - 20k.\n\nSold AAL and MGM calls on Thursday 6/4 expiring Friday 6/5 that proceeded to 5x to 10x that Friday. Today, sold UVXW and VIXY calls because I was happy they up pretty big at open. The calls went on to 3x over the course of the day as UVXW went up 50% today, and VIXY went up 34%.\n\nWhat are things people do to keep from selling. Realized today I\u2019ve cost myself way more selling too early than I\u2019ve gained from \u201clocking in gains.\u201d How do you all find the balance and also guard against your instinct to lock in gains?\n\nI\u2019m considering giving myself like a limit of 2 trades per day or something.
