You buy a put option, and you sell a put option. \n\nIf you are already long a put option, you are halfway there. You just need to sell an equal amount of put options of the same expiry to turn your long put into a put vertical.\n\nHow does this minimize losses? You are selling put options for money into your account, which helps to cushion the loss from your long put.\n\nWhat's the drawback: You will only gain money if the stock price reaches below a certain price, and the gains will be much less than from just holding a long put option. But if you don't expect your long put to ever be ITM, this shouldn't matter. \n\nThe long put vertical is essentially theta neutral and delta neutral AKA time decay and underlying stock price movements affect the long put option and the short put option in opposite manners, so the net effect is around 0.\n\nPictures for dumdums:\n\nBuying your put options like a loser: https://imgur.com/HIQ41Gm\nMax loss is $1712\n\nSelling a put option to offset some losses:\nhttps://imgur.com/uhq1aOE\nMax loss $43\n\nYou sold an option at the same expiry. You sell something, that means money goes into your account. Very good for you. Both options expire worthless if the stock price stays above ~238", "created_utc": 1584544057.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkqz18/psa_to_sad_bears_if_you_have_a_losing_long_put/", "is_self": true}
