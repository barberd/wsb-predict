Sit in room, jerk off to loli waifu or whatever the fuck you degenerates like, and then just watch the free tendies roll in. It's so easy a caveman can do it, and that's probably why you're out here creaming your MLP onesies while buying into MSFT like you didnt miss that train 20 years ago. DEAC is merging with DraftKings this summer. Its more risk free than deciding not to ask that cute cashier for her number. It's also cheap as fuck right now. If you want to see the moon, then quit pressing your face against Bill Gates' anus and look at the glorious Diamond Eagle soaring above. Then again if you want to be crying on here with the loss flair under your name, go ahead. Buy more Microsoft. Just because you feel some solidarity with them cause your dick has the same name doesnt mean it's a good idea.
