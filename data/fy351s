Hug your loved ones and tell them how much you love them. You need to hug them and breathe deeply when you are close to them. Yes, it will seem gay but it's really just a show of love. I think we need to thank the chinese people for showing us how to stop this disease so let's fly over there and give them all the hugs. We will get through this just hug it out. Let's all just do a giant group hug on JPOW too. He deserves lots of hugs and kisses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMGM 11.5p 5/8", "created_utc": 1586475051.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fy351s/as_a_gay_bear_our_country_needs_to_heal/", "is_self": true}
