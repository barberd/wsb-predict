Some of you did listen but you foolishly sold for some dumb reason, **get back in before the premiums start actually getting expensive instead of being dirt cheap.**\n\n***Today's jumps as of 4:30PM EST:***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **$MAC: up 19.23%!**\n2. **$SPG: up 15.47%!**\n3. **$SITC: up 9.83%!**\n4. **$KRG: up 11.47%**\n5. **$SKT: up 7.05%!**\n6. **$KIM: up 6.36%** \n7. **$REG: up 2.00%!**\n\n**(Also PEI did good with 41% up, which is good for a B Class holder.)**\n\n**I have new DD** here to establish why the Hopium big mall rally of the top 7 malls (and some others apparently) will continue to rally until around end of July which is when I suspect most of the country will be *\"reopen\" in some form*:\n\n1. The Hopium Rally for the Big 7 malls will continue until July. Some states that have reopened are **still in the process of phase 2** and analyzing possible *phase 3 reopening*, and several are **just getting into** Phase 1 and are only recently starting to open, thus these reopening and traffic increases will go into July.\n\n2. Malls were and still are ***among the first to open*** with stores of various categories fro grocery, to clothing, to pharmacy, to novelties, to grooming. A lot of these were **open even in April** depending on the city/state and have become the primary access point as other shopping strips are slow to reopen.\n\n3. Some A rated malls ***are also integrated into the city***, whether as a hang-out or meeting area, a way to get to transport or other parts of the city, or holding a majority of businesses or a good amount within a district. This means as **some towns and cities reopen and traffic to shops and other aspects increase, the malls revenue and traffic will also increase by** ***default.***\n\n4. Large mall operators generally own more than just the malls and tenant leases, some own their own stores or services that are around or part of the mall. This can include public \"local\" parks', brands, partnerships with local transportation etc.\n\n5. Another example of point 4 is the Big Mac ($MAC) owns several business and ***apartment buildings*** around several of their higher class mall properties (indoor and outdoor), as well as meeting spaces, and ***partnerships to help small or online companies get retail space on rotation (called brand box)***.\n\n6. Some states/cities/towns will still have a ***few weeks to another month of curfews or restricted access to certain areas,*** which makes the **shopping centers/malls the best place to \"gather\" or \"entertain\"**\n\n7. Many of these top 7 operators properties are right next to, or nearly attached to many of the casinos or similar entertainment venues, **which means as they open the traffic and money will increase for malls/centers as well.**\n\n8. Finally, Many analysts have changed their minds and admitted t**raffic and mall activity has been higher then they have believed and are increasing ratings**. Also, *less businesses as expected have closed down,* and have retained their tenancy to these top 7 operators, and have been bringing jobs back. ***So as jobs start returning more than people expected***, a lot of these jobs will be in these mall/centers, which means that as people go back to work, the Malls will benefit via increase.\n\nI have my positions in the other thread linked above, plus about to possibly buy some more SKT as that is doing better than even I expected. The premiums for many of these are still cheap, just buy and *walk away until July if you aren't able to handle the emotions*. Most of them will be near and maybe at (and if lucky over) their pre-covid numbers, **which means theirs plenty of room to run.**\n\nI notice some of you sold, ***the rally doesn't end today people***, it won't be ending anytime soon, it's a V shaped recovery before the crash baby.\n\nJump in now while premiums on the big 7 (excluding spg) are insanely dirt cheap because **there are still crazy people doubting the facts, for some weird reason despite the month of increases** ***and the recent 3 day in-a-row super rally still going on now.***", "created_utc": 1591414632.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gxjlzi/mall_reit_dds_revenge_i_told_yall_not_to_mess/", "is_self": true}
