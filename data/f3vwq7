You get paid about $1.15 to buy $SPCE on leverage. \n\nBuy SPCE-WS for $14.45. Call your broker immediately to exercise the warrant. They will ask for $11.50 (or cashless exercise, no problem), which you will gladly pay. $25.95 total.\n\nMeanwhile, short 1 share of SPCE. Take the $27.10 and buy some free tendies with it.\n\nHold both positions for 1-2 weeks, and when the SPCE share shows up in your account from the warrant, you have made some free money at a rate of about 5% over 2 weeks. Not bad as far as free money goes.", "created_utc": 1581702985, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3vwq7/spcews_warrants_are_literally_free_money_hear_me/", "is_self": true}
