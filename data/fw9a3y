How about this:\n\nWho do you think was panic selling when they heard that some crazy virus was about to end the world? Who's ear do all the media outlets dance for like little autistic monkeys flinging feces at one another? That's right. Your poor wittle grandma. Does she know what investing is or how it works? Fuck no. \"Sell now.\" she says, \"I can't afford to cough by myself if the world ends.\" All alone and scared, the first thing she did was call up her broker and tell them to sell all of her shit. \"I don't care how much I've already lost. I have to reserve my ventilator.\" Just like how she planned her funeral years ago and told you all about it during that really awkward Christmas get-together. Well good fucking thing she did, because **Granny's fucking dead**.\n\nSo? How does granny's untimely demise factor into all of this?\n\nNo one is selling anymore. Every retard younger than 40 has heard that you buy when there's a recession. Every Chad on the block is grabbing stonks like Trump at a Miss America pageant. *And now they're doing it with Granny's inheritance money.*\n\nBut but, unemployment!\n\nPssh, get fucking real. The stimulus bill is on the way, didn't you hear? *1,200 cold hard cash*. Why pay rent now when you can use that money on stonks and pay rent later? Fuck the landlord. And unemployment is going to pay gig workers and give an extra $600 on top? Fuck, that sounds like stonk money music.\n\nQuit holding your little dicklett and jerking it to puts. Chad bulls until there's rioting in the streets, then long torches.\n\n**Granny's dead, baby. Granny's dead.**\n\nSPY 340c 11/20.", "created_utc": 1586215032.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fw9a3y/grannys_dead_stonks_go_up/", "is_self": true}
