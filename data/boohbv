{"id": "boohbv", "title": "While everyone is fretting to and fro over their tendies for the week, here's some long-term general market \"DD\" from your friendly neighborhood time traveler", "selftext": "* Everyone will make their own shit in the future. Long 3D printers, open-source software and hardware, and pretty much anything with a product more decentralized than its competitors\n* Copyright law is in its death throes after being beaten down by public opinion and human nature and technological advancement for the past several decades, short copyright holders and coupled with how everyone in the future can make their own shit copying classic industrial recipes probably best to short trademarked name brands too, long distribution platforms and production houses and stuff that don't rely on bullshit like that to make a profit, like movie theaters, or if you have forex, cd projekt red\n* As a corollary to those last two points, there are some name brands people will always have some kind of personal connection to such as nostalgia or legitimate trust in the underlying company, and authenticity will always have some value, so when everyone can get bootleg shit or make whatever they want themselves, you should be trying to think of what companies own brands that might still survive on shelves just by emotional value. Long YUM and KHC, imo, not as strongly as I recommend everything else here though because it's a bit too low-risk/safe-reward for someone like me who understands the radical volatility of the real world \n* Ridesharing is inherently profitable and does not require self-driving technology. Uber has the most market saturation and is a fucked up company so as an investment they offer the most risk for the least upside, but you can long any ridesharing investments other than them for the foreseeable long-term future and beat the S&amp;P over the next decade easily, volatility be damned.\n* Trump or Yang will win in 2020, don't gamble on your feefees about anyone else.\n* Water is three atoms found everywhere on earth in very known quantities that are never quite enough for demand globally. It's the most fundamental investment there is. Freshwater and potable water just keep getting more scarce, seawater would have us all set for a few orders of magnitude of population growth and societal advancement if we could convert it cheaply. Long the entire industry, either your existing freshwater and water infrastructure holdings will make more than 100% gains in the next decade from water scarcity increasing and prices jacking up to cancel out any possible losses from your R&amp;D industry investments, or your investments in R&amp;D to make new water will save the fucking world and make way more than 100% gains to cancel out any losses from the resultant supply flooding out your legacy investments.\n* Cable companies and Hollywood are going to die hard with a vengeance, not yet obviously, but in the long term very very much so beyond what you can probably imagine, short AT&amp;T when it's about to pop\n* Video games all day nigga, future of the big-money entertainment industry (because the rest of the entertainment industry gets taken over by Lil Money and volatility) \n* TMUS biggest American cell carrier network, MVNOs a market share gobbling behemoth forever, long TMUS and any decent MVNOs, short AT&amp;T again but with Verizon too if you have the balls to call the crash\n* Dogecoin wins, after other less friendly cryptocurrencies eventually end up causing some small-scale civil wars and making at least one American bank go rupt causing the rest of the world's banks, governments, etc. see the blood and guillotines everywhere and surrender to the future\n* Agriculture is failing and either everybody is going to die before anything else I wrote here comes true so you should long cyanide or we're going to innovate and geoengineer our way out of it so you should long food industry R&amp;D and other big boy scientific research \n* Oceanic shipping is gonna have to go back to sailboats, oil isn't infinite and once we run out of bullshit the options will be to either try to develop some crazy new new shit like electric cargo ships or try to develop some crazy new old shit like bigger stronger sailboats, which method do you think will win the race to dominate that new market? Pretty sure the one with a thousand-year head start is going to make its competitors look stupid for even trying\n* China is overpopulated, not a good bed. Not a typo for bet, bet on whatever you want, this is long-term DD so I'm just saying don't embed a whole chunk of your portfolio in China. They're bound to have more long-term issues than their temporary periods of upward volatility are worth\n* Korea is a very good bed *and* bet, long South Korea\n* Long Africa, South America, and scrappy little poor Asian countries (only the scrappy lil ones)\n* Europe is a mixed bag I won't go into, foresee it for yourself if you're not a dumbass and pick your own countries\n* Buy iron condors on Japan, repeatedly forever, whenever it feels wise (good luck executing this order, Robinhood traders)\n* Long dick, 2019 is pretty much peak pussy bubble (straight male so take it with a grain of salt that I might be bagholding my dick, not that I am just that you should have critical thinking about shit)\n* Speaking of long dick and bagholding, long TSLA, they have superchargers for infrastructure and some number of top minds for talent. Short almost every other car company, almost all of them suck and most of them *really* suck extra bad. I guess if you really want to you can long F, VW, POAHY, maybe a few others.\n* Weed gets legalized federally in America and pretty much everywhere, long weed, very \"duh\" bullet point here\n* Short Intel, nVidia and most other chipmakers, long AMD, Xilinx, maybe TSMC depending on how you feel, this is somewhat in line with the general statement to long businesses with open-source connections but figured I should be more specific about these big names\n* Some cultists who occasionally eat money to gain its powers end up temporarily taking over the world, really weird chapter of history, get in on it\n* Spend the long-term repeatedly placing short-to-medium-term bets on really cool shit, money is forever madly in love with &amp; passionately attracted to cool shit and to a lesser extent really dope shit in general\n* Long Airbus, short Boeing, America in 2019 is deadass deep into the process of forgetting how to make planes, flip it around and long Boeing when America figures out how to make planes again after a while\n* Short addictions like nicotine and alcohol and caffeine, massively over-popular in present era and already been easing into the decline for a long time, ready to get slammed out by the weed legalization and simultaneous cultural shift\n* Long starvation, short malaria (idk how)\n\nI'm hungry, that's all for now", "created_utc": 1557867573, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/boohbv/while_everyone_is_fretting_to_and_fro_over_their/", "is_self": true}
