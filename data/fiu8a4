Guess when he got his results?\n\nSATURDAY. TODAY. Full four day lag. THE MOST SOLID OF WORK BY THE CDC. Not sure if other people have heard this or if this delay has already been passed around, but it's legit. 4 f\\*\\*\\*ing days. My friend kept in touch with other people that were quarantined that day as well, and they all haven't received their results yet. \n\nPROOF OF HIS TEST ATTACHED. Feel free to reverse image search...he took it on Wednesday. \n\n[https://imgur.com/a/3OnqQ0N](https://imgur.com/a/3OnqQ0N)\n\nSPY 180P 4/20", "created_utc": 1584238993.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fiu8a4/testing_delays_in_minnesota/", "is_self": true}
