{"id": "gc6zj1", "title": "Uber Earnings DD", "selftext": "Here's an interesting indicator for Ubers upcoming earnings. An Uber eats competitor (Foodora) has just up and left Canada with about two weeks notice, citing profitability issues [CBC News article] (https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbc.ca/amp/1.5546642). Note they indicate the competitive landscape is rough in Canada. This is no different than the US with the exact same players everywhere. And Foodora operated a lot out of major cities that are similar in size and density to US cities (Toronto, Montreal). I believe this is a great indicator of upcoming shittier-news-than-expected for Ubers earnings call. \n\nNow seeing as how Uber eats is one of the only theorized things to be making money for Uber these days, they are clearly suffering what Amazon is in that revenue may be there (maybe it isn't even there really), but profit isn't. Earnings are may 7th and it should drill to 25 I would say if earnings miss something like 30%+ from revised consensus. Now I know I will catch some \"priced in\" shade, but the market is irrational right now and the stock is irrationally high for a company that already lost fuck tons of money under normal circumstances, and now can't get any fucking volume. \n\nFor the ambitious it might even drop to 22.5 given the absolute fallout this upcoming earnings will have. They are so fucking junk grade that I don't even know if pow pow would print for their bonds. \n\nTLDR: $UBER 25p 05/08.\n\nEdit: added context to the link between the two and minor shit\n\nEdit: there's been some shade about using the Canadian market as an indicator...think size guys. Toronto proper is larger than Chicago proper. Montreal is larger than Philly. If you saw a post saying doordash couldn't make a profit in Chicago or Philly, you would be like oh fuck maybe I'll short skip. It's the same fucking thing guys.... Foodora isn't delivering to the igloos of northern Canada that some of you are thinking, nor are they biking out to fucking dairy farms and maple syrup forests.
