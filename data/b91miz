{"id": "b91miz", "title": "Help me with MNX (mini nasdaq 500)", "selftext": "A month ago I started paper trading the Nasdaq 500 (NDX) to wet my toe in options trading.  Once a week I would buy on a dip one option, 30 points above the current strike, set to expire 1-1/2 - 2 weeks. I would sell any where from 50% - 100% profit. The trading was bitter/sweet. The bitter was I don't have the kind of money to do this in real life, but sweet that it was working. \n\nCBOE offers a mini  500 that is 1/10. The bid/ask ran about 10% higher than the NDX b/a. With the NDX I can trade every week,  but the MNX does not.  The next expiration is not until Dec '19. The last exp was 3/15/2019.\n\nDoes this index only come available twice a year or only if the CBOE decides to offer. I would like to get into trading MNX because it's more affordable to me. I've searched every where to find an explanation but found nothing specific to MNX. \n\nThanks", "created_utc": 1554315741, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b91miz/help_me_with_mnx_mini_nasdaq_500/", "is_self": true}
