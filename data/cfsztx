{"id": "cfsztx", "title": "$NOK for the value investor", "selftext": "Nokia DD\n\n\n\nNokia is an interesting, somewhat overlooked story, that has a lot of value and potential in the near term. Here is some DD to consider:\n\n\n\nHistorical Reputation: Nokia is not the one-trick pony as many think. Much of the perception around Nokia is due to its cell phones from 2000-2010 which became obsolete due to the introduction of iOs and Apple's IPhone. Few realize that the company actually started in 1899 as a paper supplier and has conti ually transitioned based on market/industry trends to remain profitable and healthy. They have done this continually and have a huge new stake in 5G and surrounding new technologies. \n\n\nAlso, it is important to remember that the lingering aftertaste of Nokia's old cellphone tech is a fading one. Many of the new market purchasers are younger and did not ever own Nokias. This also is irrelevant in emerging markets.\n\n\n\n5G Market Share: 5G is here and Nokia is a player within the space - no surprise there. What is intriguing about Nokia is NOT that they are leading some tech in 5G, it is that they have positioned themselves as an end-to-end supplier for operators within the space. This has TREMENDOUS upside for 2 reasons: (1) With the rise of high-tech manufacturing, new enterprises will be able to purchase -at scale- all inclusive 5G tech from Nokia without dealing with a piece-mealing their tech together from different vendors. Nokia makes this globally available. (2) The end-to-end portfolio can allow Nokia to easily grow/shrink areas of their company to match industry trends and remain profitable.\n\n\n\n5G Contracts:  As of today Nokia has 42 inked contracts for 5G. These are revenue generating contracts for deliverable 5G tech. Not R&amp;D, not \"trials\", actual 5G contracts. Currently they are the largest provider globally. And they are contracted with some large players including T-Mobile, Sprint, China Mobile, China Unicom, BT Group, SoftBank, US Cell Core, and Taiwan Star Telecom. For me the India contracts are the most appealing. \n\n\n\nCash Flow, Profits, and Rajeev Suri: Nokia has put most, if not all, its efforts to the development of 5G and related new techs. They have sold over 80 patents, and remain nimble enough to continually grow. Additionally, they are not rushing to increase their operating margins and are HONEST about that fact with investors which makes them a long play. Since they are reinvesting much of their revenues back into new tech, they have stated that Q1 &amp; Q2 will remain underwhelming in 2019 with revenue rising sharply in Q3 &amp; Q4 as the contracts become revenue-generating. All this being said about their profits, they still continue to pay out an annual dividend of over 5% to their investors for a $5 per share stock. This is greater than anyone else in their space and illustrates their committment to investors and the company.\n\n\n\nRajeev Suri, the CEO since 2016, has been with the company since 1995 and has built a reputation as a corporate renewal specialist in the field. He is not an empty corporate suit,  but rather a knowledgable forward thinking leader in the sector. He also has global appeal and is nimble enough to move and adapt Nokias infrastructure in response to geopolitical tailwinds.\n\n\n\nThe Investing Strategy: Based on its current price of $5.14 it is better to outright own the shares and then trade options overtop. Currently a 10 lot ($5 x 1000 shares) would be roughly $5000, and a 5 lot would be $2,500. Owning the stock outright is the best strategy before Q2 reporting on Thursday. If the stock jumps, you get a nice profit from the shares and can purchase options from the profits after IV Crush. If stock trades down, you can write covered calls and get back some premium while still having great exposure to a healthy future 5G revenue generating company.\n\n\n\nSo do I get some flair now?", "created_utc": 1563668990, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cfsztx/nok_for_the_value_investor/", "is_self": true}
