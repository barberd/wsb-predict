{"id": "g95vy7", "title": "NAT as a potential constant in volatile oil", "selftext": "tl;dr NAT 5/15 7c 6/19 6c 7c\n\nBeen playing oil and USO, made out well on some smallstreetsbets but am getting ulcers from the price swings as futures contract near expiry, USO halts 5 times per day, trump alludes to war, etc etc. Looking to settle down with a nice upward trajectory.\n\nThe constant in the \"Oil fucked\" market is supply and storage. Not a new concept on wsb, but I was surprised when I got in at such low premiums. I've already made good tendies and I know that by posting here I'm willing this market to destroy every dollar of gains, but I've lurked long and gained and want to pay it forward. \n\n**NAT (tankers, for the truly retarded) is on a consistent rise for months, the issues with crude supply mean fundamentally it should only continue to rise, it didn't dip when the market did and shouldn't when the market dips again, and it's trying to be the popular girl among tanker tickers**\n\nA few important factors in the next two months:  \n\\- June prices are about to take a big shit, hence USO rolling past June contracts preemptively to [slow their inevitable implosion](https://i.imgur.com/5Cf851d.jpg). Demand for storage will increase.  \n\\- Brent June contracts expire 4/30 , already seeing [the dip](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/brnm20?countrycode=uk)   \n\\- WTI June contracts expire 5/18, the same day as NAT earnings. Earnings are gonna be so Big Dick, that this on top of an inevitable bottom-price, potentially negative (though not as negative) future price is gonna make the news, which we sell.  \n\\- Brent July exp soon after, 5/29\n\nOil prices up oil stocks up?? Etf down?? Up???? Who fucking knows. But oil prices go down BECAUSE supply is too high, and that isn't changing, and even if it does, futures will maintain demand for storage. Something about mangos. Every time oil dips below $10 we are gonna get more news, and people will throw money into tankers.\n\nWhy NAT and not $MYBOYFRIEND'STANKER ?  \nBecause they keep talking about [how big their dick is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blqp2f0YBj8) on fucking cnbc, and if I've learned anything about this market, it's that dumbshit groupthink and popularity is as important, if not more, than any fundamentals. Two days ago they said \"We are making a lot of money\" and today they're +20%  \n\n\nOr don't, fuck you", "created_utc": 1588010656.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g95vy7/nat_as_a_potential_constant_in_volatile_oil/", "is_self": true}
