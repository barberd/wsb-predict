Here is the answer...", "selftext": "Right now market could be up or down on bad, good news... whatever makes no sense...\n\nThe reason why it\u2019s happening is because most of the negative are priced IN and any slight good news is not so today... unemployment again at record level but it\u2019s the lowest augmentation so far... hey it\u2019s a good news!! Market dildo up! \n\nSo..about the next leg down...\n\nIt\u2019s gonna go down the same way it did when the virus was still starting to slowly spread...You remember before the crash? Everybody was downplaying the virus, saying it won\u2019t spread into US for numerous reasons and all the denial... I loaded on puts at the precise moment when the market was priced in on the fact that USA wouldn\u2019t be impacted... you know what happened after...\n\nNow today the market has priced in the fact that this virus is temporary and will get fixed quickly AND the economy will re open quickly and biggly in a terrific way starting Q2 then going stronger Q3-Q4... \n\nAt the precise moment the market realize... \n\n1. Economy reopening is not working \n\neither stores are open and nobody show up and numbers are bad / stores close back because no customers / state going back to lockdown on infection surge flooding the care system\n\n2. Virus is not going anywhere and a vaccine isn\u2019t happening 2021 ... \n\nsorry to be grim here but right now only thing we got is the gilead meds reducing a little bit the time to recover which is not enough to say hey go all get infected with the virus so that we can cure it quickly and go back to normal... not happening... \n\nWe have evidence virus is mutating like the flu... you know the current vaccination campaign for the flu and sometimes they miss the prevalent strain? Same could happen WHEN we get a vaccine... and the fact it\u2019s mutating already complicate the effort on finding the vaccine... \n\nI don\u2019t see an easy and quickly way out of this one... herd immunity seems way far and we still don\u2019t know if you can get it back...\n\n3. The numbers of jobs loss that will be permanent ...\n\nThis is not priced in... right now the market expect 95% of all the jobs to be back... won\u2019t happen... unless a vaccine get us back to normal which is gone...\n\nPeople and market are holding on a pre-war world that isn\u2019t there anymore... mentally will change, the way we do stuff will change and this will require more staff less customers on location at the same time... less revenu/ more cost..\n\nTL/DR\n\nNext leg down won\u2019t happens before one of the 3 \u00ab\u00a0not priced in\u00a0\u00bb event happens", "created_utc": 1588863684.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gf8539/having_a_though_morning_figuring_why_the_market/", "is_self": true}
