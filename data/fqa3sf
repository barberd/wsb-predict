{"id": "fqa3sf", "title": "ZM- Zoom Video Communications DD", "selftext": "\\-March 4 2020 Zoom announced previous quarter earnings, which are highlighted [here](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/04/1995406/0/en/Zoom-Video-Communications-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2020-Financial-Results.html).\n\n\\- \u201cZoom has added 3.5x more MAUs YTD \\[year to date\\] than the same period of 2019 (2.22 vs. 0.64 million), so even with half the normal paid user conversion rate, this would still yield 74% y/y growth in paid user adds YTD,\u201d they wrote. '\n\n\\- The company added 2.22 million monthly active users so far in 2020, while in 2019 it added 1.99 million.\n\n\\-Is no big news that corona is causing a huge spike in Zoom user base. However this report was from March 4, quite early compared to the relative widespread chaos we see now. March 10-15 was when North America started going on lockdown.\n\n\\-One religious group, The Jehovah Witnesses(my parents sadly) have stopped there church gatherings. The are going to be holding the church meetings(3 times a week) from video application, you guess it, Zoom. \n\n\\-That is 1.2 million JW in USA, another 250k in Canada, all connecting with the Zoom app, 3 times a week starting like last week or this week. I don't even count other countries, who are also advised to follow the same procedure. \n\n\\-April Is the Memorial of Jesus, the JW most attended ceremony. Last year 2.5 million attended alone in the USA. This year it's the first year ever to be held from individuals homes, all tied together using the Zoom application. On Wed April 8, Zoom app will have 2.5+ JW's alone,  just after sundown. \n\n\\-They will be using the app till this shitstorm is over\n\n\\-March 4 Stock ticks at $116, goes to $125 the next day or earnings report. Consensus was -0.01, actual was 0.05 EPS. Again, this report ends fiscal JAN 2020.\n\n\\-March 6 onward stock heads south with rest of market, towards $110\n\n\\-Then Papa announces free money for the world, fire up the printers, and the ticker booms to $160, drops down to $135 the next day.\n\nWell what does all that mean? i dont have the slightest fucking clue. I just watch the lines go up and down and tune in for the first class stories, Yolo retards and the gay babies but i thought maybe someone else on here could make sense of tis all?\n\nIf i was i betting man and didnt think the world was going to collapse in a few months, I would go hard long on this fucker. If this bitch can rally to $160 from fake money, Just imagine what actual real money will do? \n\nZacks has it at #3. Most condenses are flat EPS, which is straight bipolar. They beat last report by 0.06 a share. This report in June will be up until like april-may. Will hit .10 a share. Send that ticker into the 2 hundos.\n\nEstimated next report dates is June 4, 2020. Going time for expiration. I mean that is if the whole fucking market does explode. \n\nPositions-Me? fuck you guys i make money the easy way, i work for it. You retards all contribute to the kong fuckery that we call economics.
