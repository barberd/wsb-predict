{"id": "h8rzce", "title": "How to use Commercial Bond Pricing to Inform Equity Trading", "selftext": "**BACKGROUND:** \n\nFirms get funding from both debt and equity. Companies usually prefer debt financing because the (upfront) cost of capital is lower. Paying interest on loans is cheaper than diluting equity with a public offering. This is because equity holders assume the most risk in the event of bankruptcy. When a firm files for bankruptcy, the debt holders must be paid off entirely before the equity holders get anything. The corporate bond, or fixed income, market has rocketed in growth since the LBO boom of the 1980s. \n\nWhen a company files for bankruptcy, all of their assets are liquidated. The bond holders are legally entitled to the firm\u2019s assets. The equity holders get nothing unless the creditors are made whole first\u2014 this is extremely rare because if the firm could pay their debts, they wouldn\u2019t have filed in the first place. \n\nThere are also tiers within the debt structure\u2014 firms issue both secured and unsecured debt. If a firm files for bankruptcy, the secured bonds get priority over the unsecured bonds. Thus, unsecured bond pricing fluctuates the most as bankruptcy risk fluctuates\u2014 they will not get a slice of the firm\u2019s assets until the secured bonds are completely paid off.  \n\n**HOW ARE BONDS VALUED?**\n\nThe principle of a bond is the up-front amount the company is borrowing from the creditor. The coupon rate is what the company pays the creditor in periodic interest. Upon maturity, the principle is paid back. The total income paid by the bond is fixed unless the firm declares bankruptcy. Thus, firm bankruptcy risk is a main driver of bond price on the secondary market. Fed interest rate policy also affects bond values\u2014 bond interest payments are usually set at issuance, so when the federal funds rate drops, the price of bonds on the secondary market rises (when the Fed drops rates to zero, high paying bonds that have already been issued become more desirable). This makes bond valuation pretty clear cut. \n\n**WHY SHOULD I CARE?**\n\nStories of trading novices using their stimulus cash as gambling money are all over the internet and even this sub. This influx of novice traders has allowed bankrupt and near bankrupt firms like Hertz and Chesapeake Energy see their equity balloon in market value even when they are intrinsically worth nothing. Those extreme examples make it clear that there is a lot of distortion in today\u2019s market\u2014 firms stock prices are highly detached from their true value. \n\nAs we all know, a significant driver of this source of equity pricing \u201cnoise\u201d is zero commission, mobile trading. However, it is relatively much harder to trade corporate bonds. Robin Hood does not allow users to purchase bonds of specific firms. Most online brokerages that do charge money for this feature, so it is less common. There are lots of corporate bond ETFs, but these do not distort pricing of firm specific debt.\n\nThe higher barrier to entry makes bond markets more efficient. Us retail traders can use bond pricing to make better informed equity trading decisions. \n\n**HOW?** \n\n[http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/BondCenter/Default.jsp](http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/BondCenter/Default.jsp)\n\nThis site shows recent corporate bond purchases. Enter a specific ticker, then show results as trades. Sort by trade date in order to see most recent bond transactions. You want to pay attention to price: the listed price is basically what the buyer most recently paid for a bond with an issue value of $100. In other words, the bond price is $100 at issue, then fluctuates from there. If interest rates drop, price goes up a bit\u2014 investors pay more than \u201ctrue\u201d value because lower interest rates make the (already issued) bond relatively more desirable. If bankruptcy risk rises, then the value of the bond plummets\u2014 once bankruptcy occurs, investors only receive pennies per dollar of face value (value of bond upon issuance, assuming no bankruptcy). \n\nFor simplicity, look for recent, high value transactions of unsecured notes. Because this type of debt has lowest priority, their prices are most indicative of bankruptcy risk. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gp14cpszyu451.png?width=881&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb6e996dc99923dc894ee41caea2d15bbc16b5ea\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere is an example. The chart shows how pricing of an unsecured Hertz note has fluctuated through the coronavirus crisis. Note the most recent price of $48.50- this means that the buyer believes that upon liquidation, they will receive 49 cents of assets per each dollar of face value (value of bond upon issuance). You can see that the value of debt climbed significantly post bankruptcy. This is because of the perceived economic recovery\u2014 debtors believe their used cars will be worth more now that people are leaving their houses again. Most recently, debtors are excited by the 1 billion dollar equity offering \n\nThe fact that the trade price is far under $100 means that the equity is probably worthless. Equity holders will get nothing unless these debt holders get 1 dollar of assets for each dollar of face value first, which is not going to happen. This bond pricing graph makes something we all already knew empirically clear: Hertz\u2019s equity ballooned in price while its intrinsic value remained at 0.\n\n**TLDR:** \n\nInexperienced traders do not touch the commercial bond market. This makes commercial bond pricing generally more accurate. These markets can provide very useful insight into a firm's bankruptcy risk in today's highly uncertain Coronavirus environment.", "created_utc": 1592133244.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h8rzce/how_to_use_commercial_bond_pricing_to_inform/", "is_self": true}
