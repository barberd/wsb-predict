For example, that \"new\" DILDO? At some point, you get used to the larger size, the high-intensity vibration, the excellent texture, and it's just a Dildo now, even though it is the top quality of its line\n\n**When I use the money to buy tendies, I adapt.**\n\nPsychologists call this the \"Cuck-Autistic Order Chronic  Kawasaki syndrome\" (COCKS for short) \u2013 I get used to being fucked in life, and the fucking becomes \"old things,\" and I decide that I need even newer things to fuck me.\n\nAnother reason that buying puts, while JPow is running Unlimited QE, was a reasonable decision on my mind. The puts won't make me happy, but I did because subconsciously, I tend to compare myself to my girlfriend. I want to get fucked as hard as her boyfriend fucks her while I write this post\n\nEven though I am a retard with limited brainpower, I tend to adapt to new things in my environment remarkably well over time, like having an account decorated with Red.\n\nI am in my safe place; they don't call it REDdit for nothing, this is where I belong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nF $0.69 4/20", "created_utc": 1585443529.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqwo2f/i_got_99_problems_getting_rich_aint_one/", "is_self": true}
