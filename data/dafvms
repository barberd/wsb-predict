{"id": "dafvms", "title": "long apple (checkm8)", "selftext": "For those of you that aren\u2019t aware, a bootROM exploit just dropped for A5-A11 devices. That is, all devices from the 4S all the way up to the X. This exploit is completely unpatchable.\n\nFor devices that don\u2019t have a Secure Enclave (pre touchID), this means that an attacker with physical access can bypass the PIN and dump all of your data\n\nFor devices that do, in theory an attacker could install a backdoor that dumps all of your data when the device is unlocked. Granted it would stop running when the device is rebooted (the vulnerability requires USB access to trigger)\n\nWhat does all of this mean? Well for security minded individuals &amp; organizations, these devices need to be replaced ASAP. And what are they going to be replaced with? The new iPhone 11/Pro/Max of course!\n\nlong apple", "created_utc": 1569676763, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dafvms/long_apple_checkm8/", "is_self": true}
