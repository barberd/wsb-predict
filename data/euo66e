On Friday January 24th, 2020 around 10:40 am the volume on the Feb 21 $120 call and the April 17 $130 call surged to about 23,000 contracts. From what I can tell, some big money entered a vertical call debit spread at these strike prices. Currently, overall open interest sits at 113,430 calls versus 54,621 puts. I blindly followed in shortly thereafter on Friday; however, the market has been dumping since because of the coronavirus. Depending on how low the market tanks this could be a solid play. Alternatively, because I now posted this on WSB I am forever doomed and you should inverse me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Possible uppies on MDT if the coronaflu doesn't ruin us.", "created_utc": 1580133199, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/euo66e/medtronic_mdt_unusual_option_activity_pre_earnings/", "is_self": true}
