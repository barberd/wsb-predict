{"id": "evm9r9", "title": "Investing My Taxes...", "selftext": "After VERY little thought I discovered I could boost my investing potential this year 20%+ by not paying taxes.  \nThe IRS has a very competitive 72 month payment plan.  They\u2019re offering 3% annual interest rates and guaranteed approval for loans $10,000 or less.  Also there\u2019s no minimum monthly payment as long as you pay them their money within 3 years!  \n\nAssuming I can invest the money and generate a substantially higher yield than 3% as well as easily cover my 72 or less payments from regular income, is there any reason not to do this?", "created_utc": 1580301089, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/evm9r9/investing_my_taxes/", "is_self": true}
