BYND is totally unpredictable! Who knows what its going to do tomorrow!\"\n\nThis is true, but what we CAN see, is that on average, it's going up. A LOT. AN INSANE AMOUNT. WAYYYYY TOO MUCH. But that's fine. Ride the wave bitches. \n\n\"BUT BUT BUT. Premium BRUH\"\n\nAlso true. So here's what we do. Sell Deep ITM bull Put spreads.\n\nHere's an example. BYND is currently selling at ~190s. So we go check out the options, and see that 205p 9/20 is selling for $53 and the 210p 9/20 is going for $57. So you can sell a 9/20 205, and sell a 210 for $400 and only have to put $100 down for collateral.\n\nThat's a potential of $400 by only risking $100.\n\nSeems to good to be true right? 4x profit with almost no downside? It's because it's a stupid ass play and unlikely you'll make profit. If the stonk doesn't make a large move by expiration, you're at risk of being assigned. if it does go up, but not as much as you wanted, you probably won't make any money either. \n\nBut don't fret fellow autists, for this is no simple stonk. This is the one true lord and savior of meme stonks, BYND! BYND is over +300% up since it IPO'd LESS THAN THREE MONTHS AGO. Until there's a major correction, which I would guess will happen in October whenever that lock-up thing that I can't remember the name of releases, it's tp the FUCKING MOON.\n\nOh did I mention they have earnings coming up next week even though they just posted earnings last week?
