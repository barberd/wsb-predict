{"id": "grwevb", "title": "ASPS and why poors r fuk", "selftext": "Listen up Jabronis, these foreclosure/eviction moratoriums are not gonna last forever. Unemployment bonus $$$ ends in July, and many states are not gonna allow people to chill on unemployment til the end of 2020. People were already upside-down on their mortgages and credit cards before all this shit happened. Some states like Iowa and Wisconsin are allowing landlords and banks to begin serving papers at the end of the month. I know in our little wsb bubble we forget about the regular people who are gonna be in for a Indonesia sized Tsunami of Pain, but this shit is coming. This isn't a bear thesis on the stock market necessarily, but rather a bearish thesis on the ACTUAL PEOPLE in the economy.\n\nIn comes ASPS, a company that specializes and makes profits during foreclosure waves and housing crashes. The reits will be fine IMO, but the everyday homeowner? Nah, these guys are gonna start rolling HELOCs to get through this, and then get shafted when those jobs don't come back and the free government tendies dry up. If you look at their 5 year chart they always spike up during economic distress. I'm looking to open some long calls on this one towards the end of the year or into early 2021 since bankruptcy and foreclosure  proceedings usually take 3-6 months to go through.  They are already almost back to their pre-covid prices, and I think once the fed chills and the dust begins to settle, the true economic damage will be exposed, and this one will go to the moon.\n\ntldr; ASPS long calls 12/20 1/21 on foreclosures\n\nEdit: Also looked into the Payday Lenders and the PayDay rule, which basically limited the rates that payday lenders could charge was repealed about two weeks ago. These businesses thrive on poor people in financial hardship, and people are gonna be screwed because banks aren't just gonna be lending money to anyone right now, and so desperate people are gonna get thrashed by 400% interest and use their homes or vehicle titles as collateral.", "created_utc": 1590627901.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/grwevb/asps_and_why_poors_r_fuk/", "is_self": true}
