[DD from a type 1 diabetic.]", "selftext": "Hello fellow retards. \n\nHere is some spicy information on some obscure companies you probably dont know much about. I am a type 1 diabetic pump user and therefor have integral knowledge about these companies and their products. \n\n\nI will try to make this brief and leave out the bull shit. These companies get a large percentage of their profits from providing supplies every month to diabetics. I use the Medtronic 670g system. My costs per month without insurance is $970 for my CGMS.. $300 for pump reservoirs.. and $150 for infusion sets. And incase you missed it this is the costs PER MONTH.\n\n\nNow you ask me why should you give a shit? Well because being a diabetic in America was unaffordable during the best of times when everyone had a stable job and insurance. Now we will have people losing insurance big time do to lack of jobs. They will eventually go on medicaid since it was expanded by the ACA for people who have low income. There are also rumors of these companies providing free supplies during the epidemic for those who need it. They are afraid of the public backlash if they let diabetics die because of lack of supplies. \n\nCombine this with the potential of Democrats winning the elections this fall. (highly speculative) i believe if they do then universal healthcare will become a serious consideration. This will all but assure profit losses because they will need to abide by the single payer rates.\n\nSo i suggest long shorts/puts on the medical device industry. Especially aim for a target of mid November. \n\nIt will print tendies for sure.", "created_utc": 1589414283.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gjb09d/midlong_term_putsshorts_on_medtronic_mdt_and/", "is_self": true}
