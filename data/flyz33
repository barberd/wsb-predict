LYV, NCLH, and SIX puts that I bought yesterday. I\u2019m not worried, I know I\u2019ll be cashing before their expiration.\n\nWe\u2019ve got more to fall. A lot more. Credit agencies have barely started their corporate downgrades yet. No bond or loan payments have been defaulted on yet. The bankruptcies haven\u2019t started yet. They\u2019re coming. \n\nCorporate debt was at record highs. Balance sheets were in trouble before this happened. Companies have been levering up 7x+ (debt/ebitda). The missed revenue, and trust me it\u2019ll be a substantial number, is going to cause companies to be unable to service their debts. Many will have to restructure. Others will be forced into a liquidation.\n\nI work in corporate banking (leveraged finance). Trust me, I don\u2019t want the markets and economy to continue to free-fall. I will certainly be out of a job. My loved ones and friends will be out of jobs. Our 401k\u2019s, brokerage accounts, everything, will all be compromised. Life as we know it will change, just as it did following the mortgage crisis.\n\nThis is the last thing I want, but I see it as inevitable. I\u2019m not a trader (as clear by my -$12k lol), but I do work in leveraged finance within the capital markets, and as such, this is how I truly believe the situation to play out.\n\nStay healthy, stay safe.\n\nEdit: my positions\n\nNCLH 4/17/2020 $7.50p\n\nSIX 9/18/2020 $7.50p", "created_utc": 1584725340.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flyz33/im_a_leverage_finance_banker_this_is_how_i_see/", "is_self": true}
