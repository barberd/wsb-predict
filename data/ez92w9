If the shares continue to rise, dynamically managing that hedge can entail increasing purchases.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cSo, now you get the picture, that every day **at the open lately, folks are grabbing call options quickly and driving the stocks/indexes higher,\u201d** writes Scott Murray of Volatility Analytics. \u201cIt is much easier for this kind of market to be unhinged, as long call holders\u2019 corresponding dealer position is long the underlying.\u201d\n\nSo /r/wsb thinks it discovered the holy grail, because it learned that sellers of options hedge their delta. \n\nu/SuXs, managed to distinguish himself from the imbecile masses of the subreddit, by appearing to truly believe that if he manages to convince some people to buy $200 MSFT calls, the dealers will buy enough shares to offset their delta to make a $1tn stock rally. \n\nJust check out his recent submission history - reads like a strong CV for a position of a full retard: [https://i.imgur.com/x3T544x.png](https://i.imgur.com/x3T544x.png) \n\nNews flash - delta hedging becomes a factor when a stock goes up 20% in a day. Or 100% in a month.  Not when you place a $100k (let's be generous) order for $200 MSFT calls. Also, while TSLA can conceivably go to $1000 or $1200 or $700 over the next week, those kinds of moves are not in cards for MSFT - hence even less need to aggressively delta hedge.\n\nMSFT is a solid company. But today, I sincerely hope it totally shits the bed or else you dumb motherfuckers will really believe that by having 20 guys spend $300 each on an OTM call you can make the share price of a $1tn company go up.\n\nBTW buying OTM calls at the open has nothing to do with HFT spoofing of orders that Navinder Sarao got busted for. That guy was just flashing a huge order on the bid side to move the market marginally up (and opposite for ask side). He never intended for those orders to be filled, so he was quickly cancelling them after getting the desired effect.\n\nSometimes you make me ashamed to be part of this subreddit.\n\ntl;dr; the post is not about advocating selling of MSFT (I have no view on the stock), the title is a clickbait.", "created_utc": 1580907001, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ez92w9/sell_msft_and_the_tale_of_rwsbs_utter_retardation/", "is_self": true}
