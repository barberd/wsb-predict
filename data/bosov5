Left unmitigated, this vulnerability could allow sophisticated attackers to gain access to sensitive data, secrets, and credentials that could allow for privilege escalation and unauthorized access to user data.  \n\n\nSince learning of the vulnerability, our engineering team has been rapidly rolling out mitigations across our fleet. We also recommend taking steps to [ensure your Droplet is up to date and secure](https://pages.news.digitalocean.com/n/c0J03IZE06XI1eVD70kaY00). This is especially important if you are running multi-tenant applications or untrusted code inside your Droplet.   \n\n\nWe\u2019ll continue to keep you updated via our [blog](https://pages.news.digitalocean.com/n/Be008E3DX000J1YI0kb6ZIV), but if there are any steps that you need to take - we\u2019ll reach out directly via email with instructions.   \n\n\nIf you have any questions about this vulnerability, you can read [Intel\u2019s initial statement](https://pages.news.digitalocean.com/n/HE0030I0XZ9kYDJ16eI00cV).   \n\n\nThanks,  \nTeam DigitalOcean", "created_utc": 1557890605, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bosov5/short_intc/", "is_self": true}
