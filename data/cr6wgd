It\u2019s worth at least 14.8 per spread bringing my profit to roughly $1730 at its current price but I can even get a fill for neat that or even lower. I know I will be exercised because it\u2019s so ITM that it\u2019s extrinsic value is below the dividend amount in the 30th. How can I deal with this so Robinhood doesn\u2019t fuck me ?
