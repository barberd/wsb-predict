Made like 500 trades in just 3 months type of trader. 3X leverage, margin, options, sugar, ES, you name it... \n\nI then YOLO'ed on DPTR (Nat gas) and woke up to a 12k loss. From there all just went to hell. I stayed out for 7 years because I could have had so much tendies by just holding my mgm and Mac but No I YOLO'ed.\n\nI came back around 2016 and YOLO'ed on qcom and their acquisition. Turned 5k into 23k then rode the waves before cashing out 18k.\n\nSince then, I have participated very little due to time constraints.\n\nI'm bad MF'ers!!! Full blown on tsla and REITs for now.", "created_utc": 1562115314, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c8hl3h/im_wsb_confession/", "is_self": true}
