Microsoft I realized has a near monopoly on gaming computers. I realized I could use this information to my advantage.\n\nREPORTER: Your advantage?\n\nDAVID (Autist): Yes, I found this site called WallStreetBets on reddit which taught me how I can make lots of money on my Microsoft knowledge through the purchase of options.\n\nREPORTER: Oh, WallStreetBets, we've been tracking that site for a while now on bloomberg.  A lot of hedge funds here in NY make billions of dollars by taking the opposite positions of whatever is posted on that site.\n\nDAVID (Autist): Yes well, anyways, the guys on there are really nice and helped me apply for a loan which I used to buy a ton of MSFT calls.
