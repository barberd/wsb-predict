This will force suppliers to make cuts whether they like it or not. Furthermore some suppliers will likely shut down all together, others will be pushed into M and A.\n\nOPEC + will have to revisit the drawing board to address further deep cuts, as will non OPEC members such as the US. The million dollar question is - how low can it go? My sense is that $11 a barrel is egreigiously unsustainable and will greatly damage the industry in the US and abroad. That means that cuts are coming and the US will have to do something dramatic soon to prop prices up. I believe what we are seeing today is near the bottom, if not the absolute bottom.\n\nTLDR:\n\n$USO $5c 15/01/2021\n\n$XLE $40c 15/01/2021\n\n$CVX  $100 15/01/2021\n\nNOTE: PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK THESE ARE EXTREMELY RISKY\n\nNOTE 2: short term pain imminent", "created_utc": 1587403626.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g4x47x/oil_leaps_uso_xle_cvx/", "is_self": true}
