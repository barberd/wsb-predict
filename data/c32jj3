{"id": "c32jj3", "title": "Attis Industries, ATIS - The \"Long and Hard\" Truth and Why I'm All In", "selftext": "**Starter Information**\n\n(If you want the fast track to my conclusion, it\u2019s at the bottom. Seriously, it's a long read, consider it.)\n\n(If you're looking to trade this thing, it's on a slight uptrend and it's bounced between $1.60 and $3.00 pretty consistently over the past two months with a very low float. I've opened up a small position two times now where I've gotten in at 1.90 and sold out at around 2.30. Overall though most of my position is in Attis for the long term. (OTC) GERS is a solid buy if you can find shares around $0.055 and sell out at $0.08 or $0.10. I'm long GERS too.  I'm not a trader so take this advice with a grain of salt. Moving on)\n\n**Background**\n\nAttis Industries, formerly known as Meridian Waste Solutions, is a conglomerate with businesses in the healthcare, medical waste, and environmental technology sectors. Management believes that the multi-industry structure is a key factor in their ability to create value for their shareholders and to fund developing operations. Attis Industries, $ATIS, currently sells on the NYSE at a market cap of between $7,000,000 &amp; $10,000,000, and has a total of 3,441,000 common shares outstanding. \n\nAs of 05/17/19 they are delinquent on their Q1/10-Q/2019, 10-K/2018, and Q3/10-Q/2018 filings (SEC Notice: [https://bit.ly/2XiAb43](https://bit.ly/2XiAb43)). As of 06/06/19 they have entered into the SEC appeals process to try to remain listed on the NYSE. According to this tweet [https://bit.ly/2WRA8Yo](https://bit.ly/2WRA8Yo) (06/06/19), the hearing went well, but no decision has been released yet. As of today, 06/20/19, Attis Industries still remains listed on the NYSE. Most of what you need to know about the SEC Appeals process can be found here [https://bit.ly/31HzdgR](https://bit.ly/31HzdgR).\n\nAttis\u2019 latest non-delinquent 10-Q (Filed Date: 08/20/18 For Date: QPE 06/30/18) can be found here [https://bit.ly/2MY6dyp](https://bit.ly/2MY6dyp) and the one prior (Filed Date: 05/16/18 For Date: QPE 03/31/18) can be found here [https://bit.ly/2XXfjfC](https://bit.ly/2XXfjfC).\n\n**The Formation of Attis**\n\nOn 02/20/18, Meridian Waste Solutions ($MRDN) sold their waste management service operations to Warren Equity Partners for $90,000,000 and the remaining operations were rebranded as Attis Industries ($ATIS). The transaction eliminated $87,000,000 of debt and allowed the newly formed entity, Attis Industries, to pursue new business opportunities in higher margin industries. The remaining assets, not sold in the deal, are worth around $44,653,407 according to their most recent 10-Q ([https://bit.ly/2MY6dyp](https://bit.ly/2MY6dyp) Page 1) and were expected to generate $3,000,000 in pre-tax earnings, or approximately $0.15 per share according to Jeff Cosman, CEO ([https://bit.ly/2x1P1wP](https://bit.ly/2x1P1wP)). The remaining debt includes approximately $20,123,523 in current liabilities and $8,914,995 in non-current liabilities according to the same 10-Q.\n\nSince the formation in 2018, Attis has made multiple acquisitions and formed multiple partnerships pertaining to all three of their business segments. They are listed below. \n\n**Partnerships**\n\n**American Science and Technology Corporation (ASTC)**\n\nTheir first partnership came on 11/10/19 and was formed with American Science and Technology Corporation (ASTC) ([https://bit.ly/2MVMijq](https://bit.ly/2MVMijq)). From this partnership, Attis gained the exclusive licensing rights to ASTC\u2019s patented Organosolv Process Technology. Under the terms of the agreement, Attis Industries will have an exclusive commercial license to ASTC patents and a lease for the ASTC Biomass Processing Facility in Wausau, WI. ASTC\u2019s patented technology proclaims to drive the value of Lignin up from $50 per ton to between $600 and $2000 per ton.\n\n**Unnamed Tennessee Hospital**\n\nTheir second partnership came on 12/04/17 and was formed with an unnamed Tennessee Hospital. According to Attis, \u201cThe partnership between Attis Healthcare and the hospital will result in a profitable, highly functioning hospital laboratory that will provide improved health care for the citizens of the hospital's community. A hospital laboratory of this size can typically process, on average, upwards of 1,000 samples per month, once it is fully functioning, leading to a potential increase in revenue in excess of $5,000,000.\u201d \n\n**Unnamed Company Believed to be Greenshift Corporation**\n\nTheir third partnership came on 01/16/18 and was formed with an unnamed company that is believed to be Greenshift Corporation ([https://bit.ly/2IV77Gv](https://bit.ly/2IV77Gv)). With the partnership came a licensing agreement for a proprietary biofuel process technology. This technology is expected to reduce construction costs and improve profitability of ethanol by an estimated $0.40 per gallon. Just prior to the announcement of this partnership, on the exact same day, Attis was awarded a USDA $3,000,000 grant to support the commercialization of patented and patent-pending lignin conversion and refining technologies that it owns. (Grant Details: [https://cris.nifa.usda.gov/cgibin/starfinder/0?](http://pr.report/dPZoy7Fr)). Conclusion, biofuels may have just become $0.40 more profitable.\n\n**New Representative Group**\n\nTheir fourth partnership came on 06/04/18 and was formed with New Representative Group ([https://bit.ly/2RqBokn](https://bit.ly/2RqBokn)). The Rep Group includes approximately 300 representatives from across the country, and it will provide toxicology and blood samples for testing in the new Attis federal lab as well as other partner labs that Attis works with throughout the U.S. \n\nTwo months after this partnership was formed, Attis obtained its CLIA Certification for its first internally developed lab ([https://bit.ly/2WTLxan](https://bit.ly/2WTLxan)). The Company expects that this federal laboratory will be testing a baseline of 3,000 toxicology samples per month by the end of 2018, which trends to approximately $600,000 per month of revenue and over $7,000,0000 for 2018. The Company also expects to add blood testing to its federal laboratory by the end of the year, which will drive additional revenue growth for the Company moving forward.  By the second quarter of 2019, we expect the combined number of blood and toxicology samples in the federal lab to be between 5,000 and 8,000 per month. This means the federal lab is expected to be generating over $1,000,000 in revenue per month by mid-2019. This adds around $12,000,000 to Attis\u2019 total revenue. \n\n**Noveda Technologies**\n\nTheir fifth partnership came on 06/06/18 and was formed with Noveda Technologies as part of the JVCo acquisition where Attis acquired a license to use Noveda\u2019s technologies ([https://bit.ly/2IT1R6o](https://bit.ly/2IT1R6o)). Noveda is leading the integration of emerging concepts like blockchain, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to streamline resource management, while helping to decrease consumption, optimize performance, and reduce carbon footprints for customers and users world-wide. Noveda's patented monitoring solution integrates consumption and generation data to provide actionable real time intelligence for owners, operators and users, including for users across networks of production facilities.\n\n**Jordan Forest Products**\n\nTheir sixth partnership came on 07/17/18 and was formed with Jordan Forest Products LLC ([https://bit.ly/2Y2OOFG](https://bit.ly/2Y2OOFG)). With the partnership, Attis announced the execution of a letter of intent with Jordan Forest Products, LLC (\u201cJordan\u201d) to provide raw material feedstock procurement services for its recently announced biorefinery in Barnesville, Georgia.  Jordan is a division of Jordan Lumber &amp; Supply Inc., one of the largest privately-owned lumber companies in the U.S.\n\n**Gyeuongbuk Institute of Science and Technology**\n\nThe seventh partnership came on 08/09/18 and was formed with the Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and technology (DIGST) ([https://bit.ly/2RoUdVd](https://bit.ly/2RoUdVd)). With the partnership, Attis gained an exclusive license agreement for DIGIST technologies. An excerpt from the press release states , \u201dAttis Announced the execution of a sponsored research and exclusive license agreement with Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology (\u201cDGIST\u201d), to develop and commercialize processes that use sunlight to efficiently promote conversion of carbon dioxide (\u201cCO2\u201d) and water into hydrocarbon fuels compatible with the current energy infrastructure.  The new agreement is intended to build on the Company\u2019s and DGIST\u2019s prior work, including the work of Professor Su-Il In and his team at DGIST, as recently reported in Energy and Environmental Science, a journal published by the Royal Society of Chemistry, in an article entitled *High-Rate Solar-light Photoconversion of CO2 to Fuel: Controllable Transformation from C1 to C2 Products*. Professor In and his team recently demonstrated CO2 photoconversion efficiencies exceeding ten times anything previously reported, achieving sunlight-to-fuel (Joule-to-Joule) photoconversion efficiencies of up to 3.3% (quantum yield 91%). Such efficiencies are an important milestone, and demonstrate that an industrial-scale sunlight-powered CO2 to hydrocarbon fuel technology is realistic to envision.\u201d\n\n**North Crest Medical Center of Springfield**\n\nThe eighth partnership came on 10/08/18 and was formed with North Crest Medical Center of Springfield. North Crest Medical Center is a community hospital located in Springfield, Tennessee.  Attis Healthcare, a subsidiary of Attis Industries, will assist in the expansion and operation of their existing state-of-the-art hospital laboratory and provide outreach services within the community.  Attis estimates that the laboratory will be able to test upwards of 1,000 specimens per month and the Company expects to generate revenue and cash flow almost immediately from this partnership.\n\n**Unnamed Oklahoma Medical Clinic**\n\nThe ninth partnership came on 10/31/18 and was formed with an unnamed Oklahoma medical clinic ([https://bit.ly/2FlC3yu](https://bit.ly/2FlC3yu)). Attis believes the account can generate upwards of $1,000,000 in annualized revenue. \n\n**Novozymes**\n\nThe tenth partnership came on 01/16/19 and was formed with Novozymes (https://bit.ly/2ZxC9uF). Novozymes is a world leader in biotechnology for renewable fuel production.  Under this newly announced relationship, Novozymes has committed to supplying the enzymes required by Attis to convert its pulp into sugar at all of its planned biorefineries.\n\n**Iowa State University**\n\nThe eleventh partnership came on 01/24/19 and was formed with Iowa State University. The partnership called for a funded research program to develop carbon fibers for use in a wide variety of applications derived entirely or predominately from lignin produced at Attis\u2019 planned biorefineries.\n\n**Acquisitions**\n\n**DTX Medical**\n\nTheir first acquisition came on 10/23/17 with the purchase of DTX Medical, LLC ([https://bit.ly/2x26JQW](https://bit.ly/2x26JQW)). DxT Medical is a national healthcare distribution partner aiming to improve patient care and provide cost-saving opportunities through innovative, compliant, comprehensive diagnostic and therapeutic solutions for patients and healthcare providers. The all-stock transaction for DxT Medical was valued at $462,000 and comprised of 350,000 restricted shares of Meridian Waste Solutions valued at $1.32 per share. I was unable to find potential revenue or income estimates for this transaction.\n\n**Welness Benefits LLC, LGMG LLC (verify Resource Group), Integrity Lab Solutions LLC**\n\nTheir second acquisition came on 11/20/17 with the purchases of WelNess Benefits LLC, 71.65% Membership Interest in LGMG LLC (Verifi Resource Group) and Integrity Lab Solutions LLC ([https://bit.ly/31KRN7R](https://bit.ly/31KRN7R)). The 71.65% interest in LGMG LLC comes from the WelNess Benefits LLC acquisition which owned the initial interest. The three acquired companies specialize in medical hospital laboratory testing and diagnostics operations. These acquisitions are said to be producing at least $1,070,000 in revenue (Page 37) with $766,141 in associated operating expenses (Page 37). All this is according to Attis\u2019 most recent 10-Q ([https://bit.ly/2MY6dyp](https://bit.ly/2MY6dyp) \u201cPage 37\u201d). The total costs of these acquisitions are as follow: Stock Consideration $1,000,000, Warrant Consideration $896,645, Contingent Consideration $2,220,683, Total $4,117,328 (Page 35). Conclusion: Total Cost $4,117,328, Total Revenues $1,070,000, Total Operating Expenses $766,141.\n\n**Advanced Lignin Biocomposites LLC &amp; UT Battelle LLC Partnership**\n\nTheir third acquisition came on 11/30/17 with the purchase of Advance Lignin Biocomposites LLC (Advance Lignin) ([https://bit.ly/2IrmSWI](https://bit.ly/2IrmSWI)). Advanced Lignin owns and develops lignin recovery, production and applications technology. Advanced Lignin uses its methods to more cost-effectively produce many different materials, including adhesives, renewable fuels, carbon fiber, and plastics. Advanced Lignin\u2019s main operations generated revenues of approximately $7,000,000 to $10,000,000 and $2,000,000 to $3,000,000 of cash flows the year prior. Along with this acquisition came Advanced Lignin\u2019s partnership with UT-Battelle LLC, the management and operating contractor for the Department of Energy\u2019s Oak Ridge National Laboratory. On 05/29/18 Attis restructured this acquisition to reduce the associated expense and liabilities of the deal by about $1,350,000 or 50%. The estimated total cost for this acquisition is as follows: ABL Shortfall Provision $2,307,363, Shares Issued and Sold Value by ABL $1,032,000, Total Cost $3,319,363 (ALB SFP Page F-39, Shares Issued Page F-22, Document 10-K 2017 [https://bit.ly/2xpqK7b](https://bit.ly/2xpqK7b)). Take the \u201cestimated total cost\u201d number with a grain of salt, it\u2019s all I was able to gather from the 10-K and I was unable to find an official number online. \n\n**Genarex FD LCC**\n\nTheir fourth acquisition came on 05/29/18 with purchase of a 49% stake in Genarex FD LLC ([https://bit.ly/2KoKA8l](https://bit.ly/2KoKA8l)). Genarex is a technology development company focused on refining low-cost renewable feedstocks into functional biofillers. Genarex is capable of recovering about 1.1 pounds of biobased plastics additive per gallon of ethanol produced, which equates to an expected $11 million in new EBITDA from each 100 million gallon per year ethanol facility. Under applicable agreements, the Company agreed, in pertinent part, to pay an aggregate purchase price of $2,266,667, plus 8% of the EBITDA and certain material transaction proceeds of the Company\u2019s Innovations group. An initial payment was made at closing in the form of 1,000,000 common shares and 22,600 of the Company\u2019s Series G preferred stock. The preferred stock converts into common stock at the greater of $0.50 per share or 100% of the prevailing market price for the thirty days prior to conversion, up to a maximum of 9.9% of the Company\u2019s issued and outstanding common stock. The agreements require the Company to register the shares by August 31, 2018, and for all sales thereafter to be limited to the greater of $50,000 or 50,000 common shares per month, amongst other conditions. Conclusion, adds an extra approximate $10,120,000 to Attis\u2019 EBITDA per plant.\n\nFLUX Carbon LLC (JVCo)\n\nThe companies fifth acquisition came on 05/31/19 with the purchase of an 80% stake in FLUX Carbon LLC (JVCo) ([https://bit.ly/2Iv5SyZ](https://bit.ly/2Iv5SyZ)). JVCo is a new joint venture company between Attis Industries and Greenshift Corporation that holds the rights to an expansive portfolio of clean technologies and manages an existing engineering and licensing business. This new joint venture can be expected to initially contribute between $2,000,000 and $3,000,000 to Attis\u2019 earnings. The existing business generated approximately $7,000,000 per year in sales with gross margins of about 70% for the three-year period ending December 31, 2017.  The Company agreed to pay an earn-out based purchase price with a floor of $18 million. An initial payment was paid at closing in the form of restricted shares of the Company\u2019s stock, including 180,000 shares of the Company\u2019s Series G preferred stock. GreenShift is required to use the first proceeds received upon sale of the shares to pay or refinance its senior secured debt. \n\nThe opportunity with Greenshift and JVCo could be huge for Attis. Greenshift is currently in legal battles over patent infringement, claiming that multiple ethanol producers have infringed on their patents. According to Attis\u2019 press release linked above, \u201cCleanTech and its inventors developed and commercialized a process that intercepts the flow of that final third in the plant, extracts corn oil, and returns the stream back to the host for completion of drying. The extracted oil is then most commonly sold as a feedstock for refining into biodiesel for about $0.25 per pound. CleanTech has licensed its portfolio of corn oil extraction patents to producers of about 12% of the 15 billion gallons of ethanol produced annually in the U.S. However, CleanTech estimates that upwards of 90% of the corn ethanol industry practices methods covered by CleanTech\u2019s patents, and some of those patents are the subject of litigation which CleanTech has asserted against about 10% of the industry alleging infringing use since 2010. \n\nOn 09/05/18 Attis and Greenshift filed an appeal to overturn the initial ruling that Greenshift\u2019s patent portfolio was unenforceable. The legal battle is still raging on. More information on the legal battle can be found at [http://greenshift-gers.blogspot.com/](http://greenshift-gers.blogspot.com/). The full appeal can be found here [https://www.greenshift.com/content/investorresources/pdf/appeal\\_2018\\_08\\_29\\_brief.pdf](https://www.greenshift.com/content/investorresources/pdf/appeal_2018_08_29_brief.pdf). \n\n**Quality Rx Returns LLC**\n\nThe companies sixth acquisition came on 08/08/18 with the purchase of Quality Rx Returns LLC ([https://bit.ly/2WVCIBF](https://bit.ly/2WVCIBF)). Quality Rx Returns is a full-service provider of pharmaceutical reverse logistic solutions, serving pharmacies, hospitals, and healthcare providers nationwide. Attis plans to grow the Quality Rx business through its existing robust sales infrastructure, including its recently announced partnership with a new nationwide representative group. The Company\u2019s potential network now includes the 4,749 hospitals and 45,000 long term care facilities located in the United States. In addition, the Quality Rx acquisition is expected to expand the Company\u2019s service capability for large quantity generators and manufacturers of pharmaceutical waste by the third quarter of 2018, and enable the Company to expand its licensing to include high margin services for the return and destruction of DEA pharmaceuticals. I was unable to find the financial impacts of this acquisition.\n\n**Custom Cable Services (Hasn\u2019t Closed Yet, Both Parties Still Working On)**\n\nThe company\u2019s \u201cpotential\u201d seventh acquisition came on 09/10/18 with a purchase agreement between Attis and Custom Cable Services ([https://bit.ly/2ZCRpGN](https://bit.ly/2ZCRpGN)). The agreement is an all stock deal valued at $4.6 million. The transaction has yet to close but is still being worked on by both parties. Custom Cable Services, Inc. is a broadband network construction and maintenance firm. Over the past 5 years, CCS has generated consistent annual revenues between $10-$12 million with $1.5-$2.0 million in EBITDA. CCS has key long-term relationships with Charter and Cox Communications for multi-year projects.\n\n**Fulton Ethanol Plant**\n\nThe company\u2019s eighth and most recent acquisition came on 06/04/19 with the purchase of Sunoco\u2019s 85,000,000-gallon Fulton ethanol plant ([https://bit.ly/2ESnkLh](https://bit.ly/2ESnkLh)). According to Attis, the plant is expected to produce $150,000,000 in annualized revenues and lay the foundation for their other patented technologies. With their current patent and license portfolio, they expect to have industry leading margins at this facility. They also have plans to upgrade this location from 85,000,000 gallons to 100,000,000 gallons, adding an extra $20,000,000 and pushing revenues to $170,000,000. At today\u2019s current ethanol prices (06/19/2019), ethanol plants are averaging a profit of between $0.17 and $0.30 per gallon of ethanol produced ([https://bit.ly/2Rm3q0k](https://bit.ly/2Rm3q0k)). This means that Attis could see a bottom line of between $17,000,000 and $30,000,000 from Fulton alone. Attis also has plans to purchase two to three more facilities over then next one to three years and expand operations at Fulton to include other bioproducts such as plastics and carbon fiber. The current full specifications of this plant are as follows: 85,000,000 gallons of ethanol, 360,000,000 pounds of CO2, 455,000,000 pounds of distiller's dried grains with solubles, 18,000,000 pounds of distillers corn oil, and 4,000,000 pounds of malted grain. This plant was purchased from Sunoco for $20,000,000 and was recently appraised at a value of $57,000,000. Sunoco had a write down of $47,000,000 for the facility in their most recent 10-Q ([https://bit.ly/2Kt5ov7 Page 6](https://bit.ly/2Kt5ov7%20Page%206)) leading me to believe that the assets true value is somewhere between the $20,000,000 purchase price and the $47,000,000 write down.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSo, what does this all add up to? If you play it extremely conservatively, after their most recent acquisition and excluding non-closed deals and non-guaranteed figures, Attis will have a total of $91,653,407 in total assets and a debt load of between $30,000,000 and $35,000,000. Total revenues will be between $150,000,000 and $180,000,000 by the end of 2019. From these revenues, they will have a bottom line of at least $17,000,000, possibly more. \n\nWhat\u2019s the downside? They are delinquent on their filings for some undisclosed reason and are currently wrapped up in a patent infringement case that could decide the future of Attis Innovations, Greenshift and JVCo. It is my belief that the JVCo joint venture is partly responsible for Attis\u2019 delinquent filings. The downside of this investment could be zero for both companies. With Attis\u2019 recent acquisition, management\u2019s capital allocation ability, presidential policies, and the companies Healthcare revenues, I personally feel that at least Attis is here to stay. \n\nAttis currently trades at a market cap of below $10,000,000 and I believe that the market cap should be at least equivalent to my estimated book value of around $50,000,000 at some point in the future. This figure does not include any potential growth avenues or discounted cash flow valuations. I believe the potential market cap could be much, much higher if everything goes in Attis\u2019 favor. The downside risk is still very real so be wary and I would recommend not betting the farm on it. Good luck and happy investing, or gambling if that\u2019s what you\u2019re into; I don\u2019t judge.\n\n**Disclosure**\n\nI am not claiming to be a professional and that should be abundantly clear if you have read this far. I work a full-time job as a retard and research companies in my free time. With that being said, I am not your financial advisor and I am not responsible for your investment decisions and highly recommend you do your own research. \n\nI hold investments in both Attis Industries and Greenshift Corporation.\n\n**Other Useful Information**\n\n**Full Greenshift/Attis Patent Appeal**\n\n[https://www.greenshift.com/content/investorresources/pdf/appeal\\_2018\\_08\\_29\\_brief.pdf](https://www.greenshift.com/content/investorresources/pdf/appeal_2018_08_29_brief.pdf)\n\n**Quick Read Explaining the Appeal**\n\n[https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/09/05/1565628/0/en/Attis-Industries-Joint-Venture-Partner-Files-Appeal-in-Patent-Infringement-Case.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/09/05/1565628/0/en/Attis-Industries-Joint-Venture-Partner-Files-Appeal-in-Patent-Infringement-Case.html)\n\n**Past Reddit Posts from Different OP's**\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/amrcmy/attis\\_industries\\_atis\\_could\\_be\\_a\\_sleeping\\_giant/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/amrcmy/attis_industries_atis_could_be_a_sleeping_giant/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/9mk5s7/another\\_dd\\_post\\_atis\\_attis\\_industries/?utm\\_medium=android\\_app&amp;utm\\_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/9mk5s7/another_dd_post_atis_attis_industries/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)\n\n**Attis Twitter Pages**\n\n[https://twitter.com/attisindustries](https://twitter.com/attisindustries)\n\n[https://twitter.com/attisinnovation](https://twitter.com/attisinnovation)\n\n[https://twitter.com/attishealthcare](https://twitter.com/attishealthcare)\n\n[https://twitter.com/AttisBio](https://twitter.com/AttisBio)\n\n[https://twitter.com/AttisBiofuels](https://twitter.com/AttisBiofuels)\n\n**Attis Facebook Page**\n\n[https://www.facebook.com/AttisIndustries/](https://www.facebook.com/AttisIndustries/)\n\n**CEO Interview**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXme3FAaxBE&amp;app=desktop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXme3FAaxBE&amp;app=desktop)\n\n**Second CEO Interview**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCMP7R-Tot8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCMP7R-Tot8)\n\n**Shareholder Update Call**\n\n[http://ir.attisind.com/ir-calendar/detail/3377/shareholder-update-conference-call](http://ir.attisind.com/ir-calendar/detail/3377/shareholder-update-conference-call)\n\n**News Story About Recent Facility Acquisition**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCEQcWv73ao](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCEQcWv73ao)\n\n**Small Caps Daily Articles**\n\n[https://smallcapsdaily.com/attis-industries-investing-in-a-sustainable-future/](https://smallcapsdaily.com/attis-industries-investing-in-a-sustainable-future/)\n\n[https://smallcapsdaily.com/attis-industries-aiming-to-disrupt-fossil-fuel-markets-with-groundbreaking-advancements-in-bioprocessing/](https://smallcapsdaily.com/attis-industries-aiming-to-disrupt-fossil-fuel-markets-with-groundbreaking-advancements-in-bioprocessing/)\n\nOh yeah, I also started a subreddit dedicated to following Attis, so I\u2019m going to shamelessly plug that at the bottom here.
