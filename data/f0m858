Today I made $500 on INO and promptly lost $2.5k trying to chase more gains before it took a dump right at close and during AH.\n\nMy portfolio is about $140k and I typically trade using margin, trying to close out each night, but sometimes I forget and hold $50-75k of stocks overnight. I try not to, though.\n\nHow do I overcome greed which appears to be the reason I lose money? If I make a few hundred in a day I can't just sign out and leave well-enough alone. I try to make more or recoup earlier losses which makes everything worse.\n\nIf someone put $300 in cash in front of me I'd take it and be happy, but for some reason trading stocks doesn't seem as real to me, and lately it's been killing me.", "created_utc": 1581134266, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f0m858/serious_how_do_you_get_over_greed_when_trading/", "is_self": true}
