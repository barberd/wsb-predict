{"id": "ghosjl", "title": "PFE might be about to blow this week", "selftext": "So I have a birdy who was telling me about these reports of Pfizer looking to outsource production of certain drugs in order to transition completely to this vaccine. This birdy told me two other NY facilities are now currently preparing to do so as Pfizer must have received some positive feedback from these trials so far. They expanded even further beyond their original outsourcing to a facility on Long Island. \n\nKeep an eye on Pfizer, and it might be worth throwing some money on end of may and end of June calls just in case they get some sort of serious hype behind their vaccine. It\u2019s up on the news, but that news will be expanded upon here shortly. \n\nWest pharma, gerresheimer, hospira, pyramid, etc.\n\nBonus play: Agilent calls and sell before earnings.", "created_utc": 1589208064.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghosjl/pfe_might_be_about_to_blow_this_week/", "is_self": true}
