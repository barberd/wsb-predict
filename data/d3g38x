{"id": "d3g38x", "title": "Patient Tendies Strategy", "selftext": "Yo guys I wanted to share a strategy that has been working pretty well for me and I think could help a lot of you autists out that are consistently losing money with smaller accounts or have shit luck with buying puts. This isn't some super obscure strategy and Im sure many of you play it or know about it. Basically every time one of these low float meme stonks like FSLY or BYND has a massive run up and just consolidates for a few days, I put a huge portion of my account into slightly ITM call credit spreads. Far enough ITM to skew the risk to reward ratio to about 1:1 or better depending on how retarded the run up was. I give myself time to be wrong so usually these spreads are anywhere from 40-100 days out. Yes, sometimes the bid/ask spread is absolute shit but it hasn't stopped me from acquiring tendies. Play it safe boys, try to do some research on lock up expirations, short float, announcements, volume, and options liquidity for the stock. Not all stocks fall just because of lockup expiration after a sizable run up from IPO, but after a ridiculous squeeze into the 200's on something like BYND, I feel pretty comfortable selling deep ITM spreads that are a few months out or less. If it drops massively in a short amount of time then you can net an easy 50% or just patiently wait until the spreads expire to collect the full credit. Be smart yoloing and take profits when you can because these things can randomly squeeze until their lockup expires or short interest massively decreases.\n\nDon't just instantly yolo your whole account into BYND credit spreads from this post if you have no idea what you are doing, its price is still crazy but I haven't touched it since after the drop from high 160's, but will be keeping a close eye on it.\n\nTLDR- sell ITM call credit spreads on meme stocks 40-100 days out after crazy run ups, be patient and wait for tendies.", "created_utc": 1568329573, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d3g38x/patient_tendies_strategy/", "is_self": true}
