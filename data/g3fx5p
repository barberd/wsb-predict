Or they\u2019ll be eased back so that there\u2019s more to do other than stay at home and watch NFLX.\n\nIt\u2019s likely the economy will continue to hurt people in their wallets more in the coming months. Meanwhile, they\u2019ll be leaving their home more often with less cash to burn on subscription services. By this point the nagging monthly payments combined with resentment of having been stuck watching all this NFLX over the last few months would lead to cancellations offsetting any sub growth.\n\nFurther, NFLX will eventually encounter a gap in new content with production shut down throughout these shelter in place orders. The lack of new content would further expedite cancellations and likely sour overall sentiment on NFLX.\n\nThis will take some time to play out so ideally the way id see this working is a nice but expected pop on their earnings this upcoming Tuesday with phenomenal sub growth creating a good entry point for puts about 4-5 months out.", "created_utc": 1587177175.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g3fx5p/puts_on_nflx_after_their_upcoming_earnings/", "is_self": true}
