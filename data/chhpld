{"id": "chhpld", "title": "Is Robinhood Support outsourced in India?", "selftext": "So I had a request I made to Robinhood since my cheapass wanted $100 worth of onboard credit for buying 100 shares of CCL for my cruise. \n\nAnyways they sent me an email with my document after some back and forth BS where they were having trouble with my simple request. (They kept ignoring my question and would respond with some unrelated \u201chelp\u201d). All I asked for was a pdf of the trade confirmation or a pdf of my statement this month showing the trade. \n\nI was emailing someone named Jane from Robinhood support and eventually she sent it after I told them to take a minute to actually read my request. The representative, Jane, emailed me a link to my pdf which was hosted on the website SendSafely.com and encrypted it with the first 7 digits of my social security number. \n\nAfter all this, I noticed that the person who attached my pdf to \u201csendsafely\u201d was not Jane but actually \u201cJanki D\u201d according to the uploader details on \u201cSendSafely.com\u201d and googled the name Janki which is supposedly an Indian name. \n\nAnyways might explain why support has trouble responding sometimes.", "created_utc": 1564021529, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/chhpld/is_robinhood_support_outsourced_in_india/", "is_self": true}
