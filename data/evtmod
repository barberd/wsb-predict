I should see buy some stocks associated with his lobbying  groups. Since he came from the biotech world.\n\nI  quickly grabbed some LLY options without doing any research at all on  their numbers. Then I saw they will report their earnings tomorrow.  Whoo!\n\n5x $141 call @  $2.00\n\n10x $140 call @ 2.77\n\nTotal investment : $3,770 I think... It's around 13% of my portfolio. Sooo ... not a YOLO?\n\nWish me luck? Call me an autist? Idk what to expect, this is my first WSB post. Throwaway or not. \n\n[https://imgur.com/a/QXcyjm6](https://imgur.com/a/QXcyjm6)", "created_utc": 1580333313, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/evtmod/lly_calls_totaling_to_3770_first_wsb_post_did_i/", "is_self": true}
