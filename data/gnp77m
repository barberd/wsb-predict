For every few shitposts, you occasionally stumble across golden DD and trusted traders among the community.\n\nI know these gains aren't much against the heavyweight traders here, but I hope this post serves as inspiration for new traders like myself. It was a painful 3 day journey of diamond hands (to an intelligible extent). For all you autists I marked which trades correspond to what since StreetSmartEdge isn't the most intuitive when analyzing trade history:\n\n**5/18**: Purchased lots 1, 2, 3 (screenshot below) as SPY hit $295 in the morning. We hit $296.75 (HOTD) in the afternoon and I'm up $3K. **Down $1K as SPY hit $294.94 from EOD sell off and my greed.**\n\n**5/19**: Down $1.5K as SPY dips to $293.50 at open. Up $2.5K as we hit $296.21 (HOTD) in the afternoon. Feeling good about myself - picked up 20 FB 5/22 222.50c for $4,500 as shares hit $218 and as Facebook Shops is being announced live. MINUTES LATER - MRNA news craters SPY to $292.02 and FB to $216.88. **Down $7.4K total ($5.4K on SPY and $2K on FB)**\n\n[Didn't screenshot my FB losses here as I just shut down my PC after a depressing day](https://preview.redd.it/jdfgrpiic1051.png?width=1021&format=png&auto=webp&s=398266448c2e2e0b841e7baf2bdfda6fd3173e60)\n\n**5/20 10:07AM ET: Up $9.2K total** ($1.2K on SPY and $8K on FB)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/goco21nkc1051.png?width=1044&format=png&auto=webp&s=160d910a350b9a837092d087e3e1319f9e32bb86\n\n**5/20 11:19AM ET:** Sold lot 1 at $63 loss - a win considering same day expiration after being down $1K. **Up $16.5K total** ($3.7K on SPY and $12.8K on FB)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/86mnhm7mc1051.png?width=1021&format=png&auto=webp&s=411179efffa0d1f3e569c262cf413dcce53c9a2e\n\n**5/20 3:26PM ET**: Made autistic trades in between, but sold 14 5/22 FB calls (still have 4 left) and SPY calls. **Realized $13.8K profit** ($1.9K on SPY and $11.9K on FB). Sadly left $2K on the table for SPY by being greedy.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t3mn0whnc1051.png?width=1041&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fcbe68c93436ce6ae1461beb03579af7a6efbdf\n\n**END RESULT: Up $18.5K profit (incl. unrealized)** \\- ($16.7K on FB and $1.8K on SPY)\n\nAlso current positions: Thoughts?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/flczbfjpc1051.png?width=1021&format=png&auto=webp&s=4929fb9651d0742b453906bb2a46b40b288d6bc9\n\n**tl;dr** in the red $7.5K and made out with $18.5K profit ($13.8K realized) on FB and SPY calls\n\nP.S. Can someone recommend a charity so I can donate tendies?\n\nP.S.S.
