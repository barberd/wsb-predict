(Spoiler no ones revenue is going up this or next year)\n\n65% of sales come from In store sales and 35% online. However spoiler girls ain\u2019t buying yoga pants right now since all gym closures are imminent. \n\nAlso earnings March 26 so your IV is cushioned from crush until then. (If any of you know what IV even means)\n\n(Long term I think it\u2019s a fine stock to hold)", "created_utc": 1584493379.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkgups/lulu_puts_to_100/", "is_self": true}
