The stocks I've listed in the edit at the bottom of this thread are what I've collected from the comments and have *not* been vetted by me. I'm floating the idea of opening a google doc for public collaboration on research into these banks. I don't vouch for any of the tickers I've mentioned in this thread. Yet.\n\nI also want to make it clear that I'm not predicting a bunch of US banks to fail. They're better insulated from this than the rest of the world. The vulnerable ones are abroad, and they're the ones with really lazy lending standards. US banks will be hit, but likely won't tank. Also, as stated at the end of this post, please correct me where I'm wrong. Feel free to leave a comment, but definitely reach out to me via chat or DMs so your message doesn't get buried. I would rather prioritize constructive criticism than a bunch of excited assent - *if I am wrong, tell me in my DMs, preferably with an explanation rather than just \"you're full of shit\"*\n\nDrop me a chat (not a dm, swear to god, reddit doesn't need two different messaging systems) if you'd like to talk about coordinating. I'll get up with you guys tomorrow. I would love to pool information and repost this over the weekend with a more comprehensive picture of what the fuck is going on with the international lending system. Cheers!\n\n***Jesus, this really blew up. I'm at work right now, so I won't be super available to respond. Suffice it to say, though, that I've received an overwhelming amount of responses indicating interest in collaboration. After work today, (4-5 pm EST) I'll start really going through all the messages you guys have send me and shooting off replies. Mods have approved a Google doc so we can all contribute, and a disc chat might be in order, since there are so many of you fucking autists that have reached out. God bless. I'll be in touch soon.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nForgot to put strike/date at the top: I'm in September BAC $18 puts. Banks will start failing later this year. It's hard to tell which ones will fail, due to the *shadowy* nature of the *shadow lending* market. That, and the dollar will moon. You want positions spoonfed to you? Fuck off. This post is half food for thought, half explanation. Trying to follow the money here is *hard.* If you're lazy, just buy puts on indices like $INDA and $EWG and $EWY: any country that's loaded up on eurodollars.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlright, you tards, listen up: this is going to be a long, confusing post.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst off, I'd like to say that I'm not smart. But that doesn't concern me, because you're not smart, either. I just began reading about repo operations a few days ago. I've seen a few posts on here lately remarking on the repo ops, and a lot of misconceptions about what they *are* and what they're intended to *do*. I've learned all of what I'm going to post here from other users on here and from my own research.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe most important thing you need to understand about the repo market is that it's a black box. It's an **interbank loan market** **where securities (ideally bonds) are put up as collateral for short-term cash loans**. The transactions are private and the market usually sets the rates. Repurchase agreements are semantically different from fed repos, but **operate in the exact same way.** This is important. Banks, per federal legislation, are required to keep a minimum amount of cash on hand to prevent liquidity issues. The repo market exists as a way to circumvent these requirements; banks run as close to the reserve requirements as possible to maximize their profitability, and sometimes run below the limit. In this case, the bank posts collateral on the repo market in exchange for liquid cash to meet the requirements again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn September of last year, the fed was forced to offer hundreds of billions of dollars in repo agreements to banks. This is because the interbank repo interest rate had reached 10% due to liquidity problems. I'm still not sure, and I'm not sure that anyone else is sure, why the liquidity shortage arose, but it did. If I were to hazard a guess, it's because big domestic lenders, sensing volatility abroad, started to pull out of the repo market. Since then, the fed has been, on-and-off, offering repo agreements to large banks (designated banks are called Primary Dealer Banks \\[PDBs\\]) and they hold a special status and maintain accounts with the fed. Once these PDBs post collateral (again, securities), money (kind of) is transferred temporarily to their fed account. These PDBs then distribute the cash in the interbank repo market (which is anonymous) at a slight profit. The fed repo interest rate was around 1.6%; on Tuesday night, it jumped up to 1.8% because of the emergency demand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe fed had planned to cut repo ops to 0 by April of this year, essentially weaning the US banking system off of liquidity infusions. This didn't happen. Due to supply chain disruptions and market volatility, the fed was forced to offer several hundred billion in overnight repo agreements this week to PDBs in an effort to maintain liquidity. In fact, this month is set to hit record repo lending balances. Furthermore, the [fed is expecting another $130b](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/repo-reverse-repo-agreements/repurchase-agreement-operational-details#monthly-summary) to be repaid in the next three weeks, sucking even more liquidity out of the market.\n\nEdit: The fed was also pondering establishing a standing clearing house for fed repos to smaller entities like hedge funds. Hopefully, they're walking that idea back, because it's a fucking *terrible* one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, here's where I learned I was wrong, and this is a point of confusion for some: **the banks don't need the liquidity for themselves.** They need the liquidity for their *borrowers*. See, these PDBs float money anonymously in the repo market to lots and lots of entities, both domestic and foreign. This is *shadow banking*. Remember when I said the repo market is a black box? Right, well, American banks have been lending money to foreign banks that don't have as stringent of regulations as American ones do. In the US, between two US banks, when a loan is written, some percentage of the loan size must be physically transferred over to the borrower (the reserve amount). Between an American bank and a foreign bank, though, no such requirement exists.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom this discrepancy in regulation, the eurodollar is born. **The eurodollar is imaginary money** that is printed by American banks: when they make a loan to a foreign bank, the loan exists only on the balance sheets. There is no physical manifestation of currency transfer. Consequently, eurodollars get *leveraged to shit*. Instead of the fractional reserve system, the ideal interbank loan system in America, eurodollars can get loaned indefinitely, forever. Eurodollars are paying factory workers, building bridges, and trading as currency. But it's *not* currency. And because eurodollars are what circulate outside the US, real USD are becoming increasingly rare.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou see, the USD has become the de facto global currency. There's a lot of confidence in it. It backs virtually every exchange of goods or services in the world. Right now, though, emerging markets' banks aren't really using it; they're hoarding it. Additionally, they're accepting *awful* collateral in exchange for eurodollars, because they know the USD has intrinsic value and eurodollars are imaginary. Collateral like subprime loans. Sound familiar? It should, because the 08 crisis was global *because of the international monetary system*. The mortgage defaults here at home were just the impetus - just like the supply chain disruptions this year might be. The subprime mortgage scandal was just the scapegoat for the **underlying fragility of the eurodollar system.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, PDBs are aware of this. That's one reason they're starting to become stingier with their lending. They know that their borrowers are accepting garbage collateral in exchange for eurodollars. They know that foreign banks are leveraging themselves up to the tits on *low-grade collateral,* which means, in essence, the fed is, by proxy, making out hundreds of billions in loans to banks in places like India for fucking used car loans instead of treasury bonds. So, say that Shyam over in India can't make his car payments this month because he hasn't worked since the quarantine began. And his neighbors all do the same. Without US liquidity injections, channeled through the PDBs and into the shady repo market, that Indian bank will fail.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, that's why it matters that US lenders are pulling out of foreign markets: with supply/manufacturing disruptions and increasing volatility all over the world, foreign banks are direly hurting for liquidity so they can make out loans for businesses and manufacturers and individuals and all sorts of entities. If they don't get this liquidity, they're likely to default. And what happens when these capital groups and small banks die? They default on *their* loans. So on, up the chain. Say JPM takes out $50b against its treasuries from the fed. It then sells that money on the repo market. Eventually, that money finds its way to Yong Jiang over in China, who took out a loan to keep the lights on in the McDonald's Toy factory in Hubei. Well, three months later, sales haven't made up for lost revenue during the quarantine, and Yong Jiang becomes insolvent and defaults on his loan. That default makes its way back up the ladder to JPM. Now, JPM can either default on its loan from the fed (and bonds get dumped on the market) or it can liquidate some of its assets to pay the fed back.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJPM has made this calculation and decided, fuck no, it wants none of that. The problem is, though, that the loan has already been taken out by Yong Jiang. Say Yong Jiang's bank needs some liquidity because Yong defaults. Well, JPM has stopped taking fed repos because of the risk, so there's no money to buy on the market, and Yong's bank fails. This happens dozens of times, across dozens of countries. Pretty soon, the international banking industry faces systemic collapse. For reference, the global repo market [is valued at $12T](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&ved=2ahUKEwjqgof02IToAhXwm-AKHY3rA8gQFjACegQICxAF&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bis.org%2Fpubl%2Fcgfs59.pdf&usg=AOvVaw21Jay8zD6uNqWJcspNvCXa) USD, and only 3/4 of it is backed by \"pristine collateral\" - government bonds. **That means that $3T of it is in equities or derivatives.** The fed's balance sheet is only *$4T* USD in comparison. Additionally, $.5T is in private capital groups, which are entirely opaque and likely have rotten fucking lending standards. No way to see who they're lending to, or what collateral they're taking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe're already seeing this beginning: [India's Yes Bank is about to be nationalized](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-05/india-s-central-bank-to-seize-yes-bank-to-help-revive-lender) due to, you guessed it, *liquidity* problems. It's been involved in shadow lending practices, and American liquidity is starting to dry up across the world. China is also heavily dependent on eurodollars, but I'm not sure how that relationship will shake out. Their economy might be so big and so vital that we're forced to prop them up. If not, China's banking system will go tits up, too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe question then becomes, is the fed willing and able to meet global liquidity demands? And beyond this, how do they force PDBs to keep printing eurodollars and continue to assume risk, risk which may violate their fiduciary obligation to shareholders? Trillion-dollar question.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, what does all this mean? Who can we short? Honestly, this is hard to say. Personally, I have september puts on BAC for $18, and I'm still looking for anyone else who might be vulnerable. Any of the PDBs with accounts at the fed might be at risk. I'm going to start hunting for SE Asian, African, and South American banks that've been taking repo money. Those are likely to be the most probable to fail. On top of that, as banks start dropping like flies and the global economy tanks, the USD is going to fucking \\*moon\\*. That's a worthwhile bet, too. The issue here is that the repo market is anonymous, so it's hard to follow the money. If anyone has any recommendations for specific banks or lending groups to target or look into more, please feel free to let me know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf the global banking industry started to fail, though, look for it to hit full swing later this year. This is going to be driven by large amounts of defaults that will be spurred by the manufacturing disruptions, the extent of which won't be fully felt until at least midway through this year. Add a few months for missed loan payments, and I'm wagering that you'll see banks start *really* failing by August or September.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's a lot here I'm going to continue to research, and if there's anything I've gotten wrong or anything you'd like to add, please speak up and correct me/educate me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSpecial thanks to:\n\nu/Psicopro, u/farisbuellerRULES, u/FlexMcgooch, u/meritorius_demotion, and every other fucking angel who answered my stupid goddamn questions and let me bounce ideas off of them\n\nThis is a good sub, guys; embrace cooperation and weaponize your collective autism\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: For further reading, check out Jeff Snider. He's a macro economist who's been shrieking about this for years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 2: thanks for the positive responses and the awards, guys! Please, let me know if you find anything related to these repo market participants, either in the comments or (preferably) in a DM. I'll either update this post or write an updated DD. Cheers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 3: list of vulnerable recommended banks from the comments - Bank of East Asia, HDB, IBN (both in India) - keep em coming, guys\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 4: this blew up even more than I expected. I'm likely going to repost this over the weekend with more information and more citations, and I'm considering the possibility of opening up a google doc to aggregate research into vulnerable banks. Hit me up in my chat if you've got relevant information on this, or if you'd like to talk about the possibility of collaborating. I'm not sure how risky it would be to pool research like this, but I'm fascinated by the idea of crowdsourcing the work to identify the weak points in the international banking system.", "created_utc": 1583457758.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fe5s7e/the_fed_repos_are_an_attempt_to_prop_up_the/", "is_self": true}
