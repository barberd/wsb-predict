Have a bit of time on these calls though so will likely hold on to them until Friday at the very least. \n\n\n**Profit/Loss today**:\n\n+360 USD Closed\n\n\\- 248 USD Open\n\n**Account totals:** \n\nCash - 75 CAD or 57 USD\n\nOpen - 3786 CAD or 2878 USD\n\n**Total Equity:**\n\n3861 CAD or 2935 USD \n\n**Profit/Loss all time**\n\n+792 USD Closed\n\n\\- 248 USD Open\n\nJust saw some news about WHO considering declaring a global emergency. \n\n[Link](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health/who-to-reconsider-declaring-global-emergency-as-china-virus-evacuations-begin-idUSKBN1ZR2VG?fbclid=IwAR2A2bYl9NvQwvasnd09fog6yGFl_l_ufvQiJioqD74IAr1P__jRLEiqbrw)\n\nI still think the whole coronavirus is over hyped though. Might have to hold these calls til next week but we will see. \n\nThanks", "created_utc": 1580331888, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/evt99i/day_2_of_14k_loan_from_loan_shark/", "is_self": true}
