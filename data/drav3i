For those of you who are brand new to investing and to [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/), this is a little gift for you - I'm going to tell you how the stock market REALLY works.\n\nPeople seem to think the stock market is like gambling. Nah son, the stock market is a stripclub. Let me explain.\n\nWhy do we keep staring at stock charts from the asscrack of dawn until the candle burns out? Those charts are the **titties and ass** of our way of life. We keep staring at these stocks twerking up and down and throwing our money away, never to get it back, but it just makes us feel great about ourselves. Some perverted degenerates need 12 monitor setups just to get themselves hard.\n\nTits up? Tits down? Who knows? Maybe it's \u00a1TETAS ARRIBA! cause you bet on an Argentinean stock last month.\n\nWhat's the Federal Reserve doing? DJ JPow is just dropping fat beats to make them titties jiggle more. Make no mistake about it; the DJ runs the fucking show. But sometimes the DJ doesn't understands anything at all (i.e. DJ Greenspandex)\n\nWhat's \"SEC\"? The SEC is the bouncer waiting to throw us out. Here are some reasons why he would do that\n\n* we have no money to keep watching (freeriding)\n* get too greedy and put our hands on these thicc juicy asses (stock manipulation)\n* peeking in dressing rooms (insider trading)\n\nWhat, you thought S&amp;P stood for Standard and Poor's? Nope, it actually stands for Strippers and Pimps.\n\nHere's a glossary of confusing terms for you\n\n* DD = Double D's\n* PRT = just the sound of a fart. Ignore it completely\n* Tendies = chicken tenders. They're tasty\n* FD = Free Dollars\n* Long = erect\n* Short = flaccid\n* Options = Coke or Pepsi\n* Call = call the stripper to give you a VIP dance. If you hold without blowing your load long enough, you might form a special bond with her and she can take you to the club safe. This move usually will make you gain money.\n* Put = put your money inside the stripper's cooch. You'll never most likely never see it again. Maybe she'll shake something out though, once in a blue moon. This move usually will make you lose money.\n\nYou're welcome and welcome to Stratton Oakmont, you fucking degenerate. Now sit back and enjoy the show.", "created_utc": 1572833529, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/drav3i/the_wsbers_guide_to_the_stock_market_stripclub/", "is_self": true}
