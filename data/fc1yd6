{"id": "fc1yd6", "title": "The new move on Monday: Puts on PG", "selftext": "The stock market is going to open red on Monday, and probably fall this week just like before. China's manufacturing is still taking a shit, the virus is spreading like crazy in France, Germany, the UK, USA, Spain, Italy, and South Korea (all of which are globally relevant nations), China's new cases per day are accelerating again, and Trump told the market to fuck off on his briefing on Saturday, saying the virus is his only concern and that the stock market can take care of itself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately, the IV of options on all stocks is quite high lately. Look at the shit people (including myself) have options on right now - TQQQ? SPY? SQQQ? IV is huge, this means premiums are high and you're making less profit because the market is essentially pricing in the probability that your put is going to be profitable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPG is Procter and Gamble and makes a fuckload of recognizable brands of products, just go look at their list, it's truly astounding. They're a massive corporation. They manufacture 90% or more of their shit in the USA. But, that's final manufacturing of the completed product.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGuess where the precursors and components they use to finish their products, come from?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChina.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Nobody in the USA makes the components. Only China.](https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/21/news/companies/trump-trade-war-china-procter-and-gamble/index.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGuess what country is still shitting itself from the Omega Flu? Yes, also China. [Their manufacturing PMI was awful](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3052985/coronavirus-chinas-factories-activity-plunges-all-time-low). They're not \"back online.\" Manufacturing isn't back to normal yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[105p 02/27 only costs 1.88](https://prnt.sc/ra124j), that'll go up on Monday (since Monday is definitely going to be red), but you can load up on these, watch PG tank over the next week, and sell for easy money. IV is lower than indexes - especially the leveraged indexes like SQQQ - and they're *going* to fall more. You don't need to wait for them to fall to 90 or some bullshit, you buy during a spike in the market on Monday, wait until later in the week to sell for 50% gains (which would only require about a $4 dip in their price, which is less than 4%, and the entire market including PG has experienced drops of a similar degree in intraday trading *multiple* times last week). Could hold for 100% gains, but obviously that's riskier. But this is DD, not shitpost. So I'm advocating this play for 50% returns over the course of a few days, assuming the market continues to slowly bleed itself to death.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for coming to my TED talk you retards", "created_utc": 1583102069, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fc1yd6/the_new_move_on_monday_puts_on_pg/", "is_self": true}
