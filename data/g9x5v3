{"id": "g9x5v3", "title": "A sign of things to come?", "selftext": "So this week we have seen the most improbable rebounds from awful earnings with no guidance in HOG.\n\nWe have also Google up 9% AH currently after \u201cnot as bad as we thought, but not great\u201d earnings.\n\nNETFLIX and AMD both did relatively better and neither (thus far) came out the other side well.\n\nSo, with FB, MSFT, AAPL and AMZN coming up this week, is all sense out the window? Will bad news moon regardless? How much money will AMZN have to report in order for their stock to drop 5%?\n\nPersonally i feel that this GOOGL example will draw even more FOMO retailers in tomorrow and leading up to next earnings. I hope we all manage to catch one, whichever one we can afford, but I fear that there will be some surprises. Google was a bit of an unknown, the report was average, and here we are.\n\nThoughts?", "created_utc": 1588112924.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9x5v3/a_sign_of_things_to_come/", "is_self": true}
