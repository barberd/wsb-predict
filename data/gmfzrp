{"id": "gmfzrp", "title": "DD: Aritzia ($ATZ) - The Great Canadian $LULU", "selftext": "As I eagerly refreshed my stocks app today counting my tendies from my LOW calls, I couldn't help but wonder how my ATZ position was going. Unfortunately, the northern-brethren of the US of A had markets closed today in recognition of Victoria day (some monarch idk tbh).\n\nNevertheless, I bring to you the finest DD on what is undoubtedly going to be the next Lulu, it's about time we migrated some of our degenerate gambling to the TSX.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; purchase ATZ stock as it is a long-term buy, but also play their Q4 earnings (5/28) with ATZ 18c 6/19.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Aritzia - What is it?**\n\nA Canadian semi-luxury fashion house and clothing company based out of BC that operates 94 stores in North America (predominantly in Canada, but with about 20 stores in the USA).\n\nThe company predominantly sells in-house brands (Babaton, Wilfred, etc.) but also stocks clothing/accessories from the likes of Levi's and Herschel among others. Aritzia has had an amazing success over the last few years, growing organic same store sales in the past 19 consecutive quarters, and posting a double-digit EBITDA and top-line sales CAGR since 2016 when the company went public.\n\nThe stock ([ATZ.TO](https://ATZ.TO) on the TSX) traded for an ATH of $26.12 shortly before the Feb crash and is currently sitting at $14.60 as of Friday's close.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why is ATZ the next Lulu?**\n\nAritzia first caught my attention from the countless packages that were being delivered to my upstairs neighbors (3 late-20s females), as well as from the various Tiktoks and Instagram haul stories that I had seen over the past few weeks. I was curious, could a clothing company that operates brick and mortar locations be doing well during quarantine? The answer is yes, and not only are they surviving the quarantine, but they are THRIVING.\n\nAritzia has one of the best-in-class E-commerce platforms of any retail clothing manufacturer in North America, let alone Canada. Their 2020 target was for 25% of all sales to be digital, I am sure that they have far exceeded that threshold so far this year. The company views their brick-and-mortar stores as showrooms for their product, but ultimately is focused on an omni-channel  sales strategy. Customers are used to shopping both on-line and in-store and their tech-savvy target clientele of women aged 19-35 are the prime audience to be spending their CERB and Trump Bux on the latest line of summer lounge and athletic wear for at-home delivery.\n\nAritzia's most popular market is BC, where recently CoVID restrictions have been lessened, and Aritzia stores have started reopening. The company has a well-thought-out approach on how to maintain customer safety for the remainder of the crisis which can be found here:\n\n[https://business.financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/sorry-maam-that-dress-is-in-quarantine-how-clothing-stores-are-prepping-for-a-strange-new-reality](https://business.financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/sorry-maam-that-dress-is-in-quarantine-how-clothing-stores-are-prepping-for-a-strange-new-reality)\n\nGiven their track-record of growth, the re-opening of their key markets, and their best in class E-commerce and social media marketing, I think that ATZ is a slam-dunk to become the Lulu in the coming weeks/months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Grass roots due-diligence**\n\nCustomer Surveys:\n\nI asked over 20 females of varying ages, cultural backgrounds, locations in Canada, and levels of economic status a few key questions about Aritizia.\n\n* What is your opinion of Aritzia as a brand?\n   * Unanimously, the feedback was positive. Respondents noted that they predominantly switched from fast-fashion brands such as Zara to shopping at Aritzia because their styles are more timeless and were of high-quality materials. They also cared a lot about the company's sustainable fashion mindset, and the various community donation and social cause campaigns that are frequently at the forefront of Artizia's media presence\n   * To gauge the response from non-Canadian residents on how Aritizia is performing in the US I reached out to a number of Americans (predominantly in California and Texas), the response there was mixed, most had heard of the brand (impressive given its retail footprint of 20 stores) but most had not shopped there recently. Nevertheless, it gives long-term support on the brands growing awareness in the US, which is one of the company's next big bets.\n   * Below is a response from a BC resident (early 20s, white) on why she shops online at Aritzia:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vlk6y18iomz41.png?width=870&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbc6d8308a19fa81c10efaa7432278df720c930c\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Have you or your friends shopped more online at Aritzia than you did prior to the CoVID crisis? If so, why did you do so?\n   * Almost unanimously, respondents claimed to have shopped online at Aritzia more during the quarantine than prior, mostly because of the style of clothing that Aritzia specializes in (lounge and athletic wear... do we want to guess why Lulu is doing so well?) but also because of an overall desire to engage in retail therapy. Many noted that although online spending increased at Aritzia, it did not for other products (with the notable exception of Sephora).\n   * The below response from one of my co-workers (mid-20s affluent white Canadian) is not unique in its description of the level of online shopping going on right now at Aritzia:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/el1s5kuknmz41.png?width=841&format=png&auto=webp&s=25909419c5eb61003294bceb6392a31adc605ecc\n\n* Have you experienced any stock-outs on products online? And if so, are they back in stock quickly?\n   * This question was asked to assess if there are any supply chain constraints in Aritzia's ability to service the high level of demand\n   * Respondents claimed that while some products were unavailable, it was only due to them being on pre-order (ie. not released yet). This leads me to believe that if Aritzia does have inventory issues, they are not widespread and they are able to disguise them well as pre-orders potentially further increasing hype\n\nOther Grass Roots DD:\n\nAs stated earlier, the majority of Aritizia's sales occur in the province of Brittish Columbia, where most of their retail stores are located (approx 20% of the system). BC was one of the early provinces hit by CoVID and only saw 2400 cases in relation to Canada's 78,000 (3.1% of cases for 14.3% of the population).\n\nI wanted to ensure that what I was hearing from my social circle, was accurately being represented by actual deliveries in the market they are most highly penetrated in. I was able to get in contact with a Fedex driver that works in Surrey BC, he was able to back up the previous survey statements by saying that almost 1 in every 2 packages of clothing he delivered over the last 2 weeks was Aritizia, and that was not the case prior to CoVID. Unfortunately this is a sample size of 1, and represents a very small area of their operations, but nevertheless, it does help to strengthen my thesis.\n\nTo further support my research, the following was posted on their Twitter account on Friday, during an event they were hosting to sell Front-line worker themed merchandise:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aglvvz61rmz41.png?width=769&format=png&auto=webp&s=729eb861c399eac28cbeb1abe1316b68da4f13c2\n\nIn summary, from the testimonials of Aritizia customers, the real world experience of a delivery driver in BC, and the company's own reports on their website traffic, the company is without a doubt seeing unprecedented online demand for their products.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Financials**\n\nHere is where the DD gets juicy as Aritzia has one of the cleanest and healthiest balance sheets I have ever seen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wyvl3ay8smz41.png?width=908&format=png&auto=webp&s=f62b9806893f97817d49e20f608a023071d39c30\n\nThe first thing to point out is the companies healthy cash position, the entirety of Artizia's long-term debt is entirely covered by their current cash on-hand.\n\nThe other thing to note is the large change in lease liabilities and right-of-use assets from the same period last year. This is driven by an accounting treatment change whereby the entirety of the companies lease obligations over the committed term of their head-lease must be included as a liability on their balance sheet, with the offsetting right-of-use asset representing their remaining tenancy on their retail locations.\n\n2 points here:\n\n1. the current portion of lease liabilities (C$58m) does not present as a cash-flow issue as almost all of the major commercial real-estate companies (Choice Properties, CT REIT, Rio Can, etc.)  are all offering rent-deferral for commercial tenants over a 3-yr period. This coupled with their healthy cash position, the availability of a C$100m revolver, and their growing online sales, materially remove all liquidity risk in the near term\n2. Backing out leasehold obligations as they are not true-debt in the conventional sense, the company has a debt-to-EBITDA of >1.3x, which is below the retail industry average of 2.5x and a healthy debt-to-assets of \\~0.3x\n\nI wont go over any analysis of their earnings history and revenue growth as it is pretty self-explanatory, but here are the charts from their latest 10-k here:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1cpssejyvmz41.png?width=377&format=png&auto=webp&s=c90520494d9b9740dde043bd4e6d716947dd5198\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/16wjyz00wmz41.png?width=373&format=png&auto=webp&s=67dcc7f8ce78fba8c5a92a352a44ec8ea842592e\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAritizia is a healthy company with growing revenues and EBITDA that has managed to capitalize greatly on its E-commerce platform over the last few months. Currently the share price is trading at a point that hasn't been seen since June 2018.  The outlook for the company is arguably stronger now than it was pre-crisis, as in addition to the points I covered above, many women's clothing retailers have declared bankruptcy leaving a bigger piece of the pie for the remaining incumbents.\n\nThe Aritzia earnings call is 5/28 but will only cover their Q4 which ended March 1st 2020, there will be no CoVID impact on these results; however, I still strongly believe that with strong FY20 guidance, the stock could recover back to its early-2020 levels. I recommend either longer term OTM calls with expiry in October in order to guarantee the impact from my grass-roots DD is priced in, or betting on the June expiry options in anticipation for strong guidance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPositions:\n\nATZ 14c 6/19\n\nATZ 18c 6/19\n\nATZ 18c 10/16", "created_utc": 1589855826.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gmfzrp/dd_aritzia_atz_the_great_canadian_lulu/", "is_self": true}
