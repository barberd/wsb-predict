Fine, let\u2019s forget that Robinhood forced the brokerage market to remove the $5 trade fee and fuck you all up the ass on the order flow. That\u2019s negligible when you consider you can\u2019t YOLO your damn portfolio away in deep OTM options for free on other platforms. I\u2019d be dammed if I lost $50 on contact fees instead of $50k on SPY puts. \n\nSo sit back and let this company fuck you over for another 4 years so you can forget this day again and your shit wiped all over again.
