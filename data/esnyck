All it refers to is the fact that the market loves to repeat price patterns and price movements, and can be seen in most long term charts of most securities.\n\nMy thesis is simple and reasonable: The entire move in TSLA between June 2013 and December 2019 was nothing more than a giant consolidation pattern, and now we are getting set to reap the rewards of a continuation move.\n\nHere are images of the Journey to TSLA $1425:\n\n[https://imgur.com/sUFp6aa](https://imgur.com/sUFp6aa)\n\n[https://imgur.com/7BHIkeg](https://imgur.com/7BHIkeg)\n\nIt appears as though this process is underway right now, and judging by the speed of the rise in price out of this consolidation, it seems that the dates could line up perfectly with the last breakout pattern.\n\nHere are the proposed moves:\n\nTSLA: **$1080 , Early April 2020**\n\nTSLA: **(40% Crash) $648 End of May 2020**\n\nTSLA: **Spike to $1425 End of  August 2020**\n\nI'm basing my estimated moves off of the percentage moves in stock price that occurred during the last breakout, thus the market 'harmonics'\n\nAll you Gay Bears still trying to short TSLA, might be prudent to wait until Spring!", "created_utc": 1579752613, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/esnyck/tsla_tesla_road_map_to_1080_then_to_648_then_to/", "is_self": true}
