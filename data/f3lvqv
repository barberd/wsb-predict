Once people start realizing SPCE is a retarded long term investment and has 5 employees and zero revenue people are going to dump the shit out of it. Puts are easy money. If I'm wrong come back in a month and call me a retard. These recent gains are just because people are pumping money into it for no valid reason other than its a rising meme stock. Even though stocks only go up, SPCE is just not going to follow that rule. I'm not a gay bear I swear.", "created_utc": 1581649707, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3lvqv/spce_is_going_to_fail/", "is_self": true}
