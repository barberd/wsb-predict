That means by definition you are going to be wrong most of the time and when you are sometimes right, it will make up for your losses and some.\n\nSince you know you are going to be wrong most of the time, you can't afford to make a trade which will lose you all or most of your money, so you can get going until you score a profit. You need strict loss limit strategy for every trade. There are plenty of information out there how to do that, learn about it.\n\nNow for the retard vs autist key difference\n\nAutist does own DD, creates a thesis by using his high levels of autism analyzing and piecing together solid data. That thesis is so insane it can actually work so he goes for it big, like a true autist he is. Now even when autist is wrong and blew all his money, his incredible amount of work and bravery that went into that trade is worth of admiration and celebration.\n\nRetard on the other hand, keeps following fomo around without any strategy or general idea how anything he is doing works. Scoring one loss after another until he is at 98%+ loss. That's going full retard, because falling for fomo once should be enough to realize how retarded that trade was. Furher retarding himself by crying about how literally every trade he made went exactly the opposite way right when he bought in.\n\nLet me explain how fomo works, so you can stop walking into at least the most obvious traps. For every trade to happen, there has to be someome buying and someone selling. That means, by the time you learn about fomo and are about to buy into it, there are traders ready to take a profit and they need you to sell their bag to you. Once sell off starts happening, which is excatly when fomo is happening, price is about to reverse hard, leaving you holding the bag of time limited options, which are going to expire worthless, because theta decay.\n\nAt last, there are now mutliple pump and dump schemes going on like ROKU, because trading volume on some stocks is so low, even a small group of people can swing the price really hard and really fast. These people will bait you into fomo on these stocks, leave you holding their bag and move on. Point being made here, watch trading volume if you see movements to know if this is new legit trend taking off or pump and dump bait.\n\nDISCLAIMER: I am just another dude trying his luck by taking advantage of high volatility and leveraged instruments with calculated risk trades. And of course I did fuck up big when greed got better of me by doubling down on my own fault thesis refusing to cut loss and holding bag until expiration.\n\nAnd I am sure for most people here this is all obvious common sense and I just wasted your time by being gay in attempt to save at least one retard from himself.\n\nPositions: DIA 260c 6/30 as hedge for SPY 288p, 280p, 277p 8/21 becuase if we have another bull, retards are likely going to pump stocks in DIA harder than any other major index.\n\nEDIT: added tl;dr", "created_utc": 1592379079.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hamkwe/the_key_difference_between_retard_and_autist/", "is_self": true}
