From the 1890s, a\u00a0number\u00a0of English language sources relate the \"unlucky\"\u00a0thirteen\u00a0to an idea that at the Last Supper, Judas, the disciple who betrayed Jesus, was the 13th to sit at the table.\n\nAt the end of the questionnaire, Jerome is asked one final time about a possible bubble to the stock market. It just so happens to be the 13th question asked. In Jerome's response, he believes assets will continue to hold their value and we'll see an invisible inflation.\n\nInvisible inflation...hmmm\n\nMy prediction is simple, JPow had thirteen money printers but the are at 50% capacity.
