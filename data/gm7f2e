{"id": "gm7f2e", "title": "Taking off my helmet and diving in", "selftext": "Tl;dr: Buy AMRN $10C 1/15 (current price ~$7.55)\n\nI\u2019m finally freeing myself of my helmet and diving into the empty pool. Here\u2019s my retard bet for the year: Amarin. In my overall risk assessment of myself, I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that in order to invest in AMRN I should only invest what I am willing to completely lose. So here\u2019s the play: I\u2019m taking approximately everything and putting it all in options that expire in December and January. Why? Two reasons: \nReason 1: European approval likely by eoy (good chance for end of September). They have about a 85-90% chance of approval with peak sales in Europe reaching about $3billion if they receive approval. \nReason 2: Amarin just got an expedited appeal in which they seek for the overturning of the patent ruling in the US. Since the appeal is expedited, this could and probably will render in a decision by the eoy. \nSo why options and not shares, Mr. BootySlapps? Well firstly this is wsb so what the fuck is even a share. Secondly, pretty much one of three things will happen by the eoy that will decide the company\u2019s fate for the foreseeable future: \nA.) They win patent appeal and get European approval. Price, depending on the market at the time, should settle anywhere from $15-$22. \nB.) Receive European approval but lose patent appeal. Price should settle around $8-$12 depending on a deal they get with a bp in Europe (which they have already been approached about). \nC.) No European approval and loss on patent appeal case. Price settles right at about $0. \nD.) I\u2019m wrong about everything including number of possible outcomes.\nBuy AMRN $10C 1/15. Let\u2019s dive in before mom gets back here with my Totino\u2019s and discovers me without my helmet (price could drop from here and creating cheaper calls but that requires patience. Fuck patience) \nEdit: this is not financial advice.
