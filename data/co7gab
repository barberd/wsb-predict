Down exactly $100 from one year ago, it is trading at $154 down from $254. The product lineup is not as fresh as last year compared to AMD. Google trends shows that the search for word NVIDIA is down. NVIDIA is reporting next week. Implied volatility is 70-80% which is typical for this stock just before reporting. I think this makes it an attractive option play for next week's options. With PE ratio of 29 the expectations aren't too high. I don't think even a miss wouldn't make the stock plummet. I wrote a pair of puts but my conviction isn't strong enough take on twice as much risk which is my usual MO. \n\nDisclaimer: this is my opinion and I am not your financial advisor even though I raw dog your sis.... Invest at your own risk.", "created_utc": 1565379874, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/co7gab/nvidia_earning_next_week_dd_sweet_77_iv/", "is_self": true}
