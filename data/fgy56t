Both companies just sent home two or three employees a piece who tested positive for Covid.  They also sent home \"anybody that came into contact with them.\"  \n\nThey are NOT however, sending everybody home or closing the campuses bc quote, \"They are sanitizing the infected area.\"  Covid about to spread through two major regional centers of two major financial services companies (Fidelity has moved a lot of regional leadership roles from around the country to their Dallas area campus and Schwab is in the same process).\n\nDo with this what you will but literally just talked to friends who work for both companies and in both call centers and, again, neither call center is shutting anything down or doing anything serious to contain the spread.  They're basically saying, \"We discovered the infected and sent them home and that will stop it right there.\"  They are also telling employees not to be concerned and they are unable to test more than a handful of employees.", "created_utc": 1583937536.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fgy56t/covid19_officially_confirmed_at_both_the_fidelity/", "is_self": true}
