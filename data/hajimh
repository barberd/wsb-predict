Stock in Ibm, vz, att, hal, and dkng to spice it up. Scooped those first 4 after the march low low, now i just watch and count the dividend peanuts\n\nThe other half is the fun stuff: options spreads on mgm, aal, evri, spxs, amd, spy, vxx, qqq. \n\nIm starting to avoid playing options on stocks. MMs got it too easy. ETFs i find much more success predicting general short-mid movements. \n\nHAL, SPY, and MGM have laid golden eggs\n\nAAL is cursed, also i have dgly calls expiring tm and i think that is the most retarded trade ive ever made \n\nWhats in your wallet?", "created_utc": 1592366040.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hajimh/whats_in_an_typical_wsb_users_pf/", "is_self": true}
