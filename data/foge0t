{"id": "foge0t", "title": "Jumbo refi was canceled today Redwood Trust", "selftext": "Got a strange email from our mortgage broker this afternoon telling us Redwood Trust has stopped issuing jumbo loans. We had locked a jumbo refi in at 3.7, or so we thought. Great credit scores and there were no issues with the appraisal. All paperwork was done and submitted last week. We received an automated message last week saying the conditional approval was received. Today we received the message with an offer from our mortgage guy to pay us almost $4,000 for our inconvenience. Shit is blowing up...   \n\n\nImage of email here:  \n[https://imgur.com/a/7Z9V6Do](https://imgur.com/a/7Z9V6Do)  \n\n\nVerified autism:  \nDB 04/17/2020 5.00 P  \nLULU 04/17/2020 85.00 P  \nSPY 05/01/2020 160.00 P  \nSPY 05/01/2020 185.00 P  \nSPY 04/24/2020 220.00 P   \nULTA 04/17/2020 90.00 P", "created_utc": 1585095042.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/foge0t/jumbo_refi_was_canceled_today_redwood_trust/", "is_self": true}
