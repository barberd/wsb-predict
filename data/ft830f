A couple weeks back, I liquidated my RH account.  It was down $2500 (from $6,000) so I resorted to options trading.  I think I'm starting to figure this shit out after starting with $4500. \n\n\nPositions in screen shot.  Holler if any of you ever want to pharma/biotech advice.  I am a pharmacist and work in the IT sector building the ordersets for oncology and non-oncology clinical trials.  Would love to give back since I have made gains from you all!\n\n[Gains/Positions](https://imgur.com/a/QmiEAUR)\n\nMoney printer on these puts is gonna go brrrr. \nAppreciate you,\n\nYour friendly wsb pharmacist. \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b\n\nEDIT:  In the future will post pharma options, not advice.  Also, sorry I don't use RH because I have a real job, sorry if it takes a minute to look at....actually I'm not sorry, stop being poor and using RH!", "created_utc": 1585773380.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ft830f/gains/", "is_self": true}
