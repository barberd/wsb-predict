{"id": "fj6y71", "title": "The day WSB cucked the market makers", "selftext": "I recently read a long theory on here about how the market makers are the victims of a [vast global conspiracy](https://imgur.com/gallery/ZESV9) designed to tank the US stock market\u2026\n\nTwo words: Occam's Razor. Why does it have to be some massive conspiracy, and not just that greedy MM are caught with their pants down in a bubble?  It's been no secret for many weeks now that this COVID19 shit is only going to get worse and cause major economic issues.  If MM were such geniuses they would have utilized the entire MONTH they had at all time highs to hedge and prepare for this once they saw what was happening in China.  But they didn't, they were too busy gargling Trump cock, writing as many puts as they could during an election year, and instead got bent over and plowed by the WSB autists.  \n\nThis extremely unique event has provided something no other market crash has EVER done  - a HIGHLY predictable timeline of the fallout of the damages.  It is as if scans detected an asteroid hurtling towards Earth and calculated it would arrive in exactly 60 days, yet the MM sat on their hands greedily and waited until day 30 to do anything at all.  We've all [seen the graphs](https://twitter.com/WSBgod/status/1238512082250653696?s=20)\nabout how quickly the stock market is falling compared to the past, and the rapidity of the modern financial world where information has been democratized is something their models did not account for.  Someone always has to be the loser, and this time it is the infallible MM who failed to assess risk properly.\n\nPeople like to look at the MM as some invincible geniuses who can't be beaten.  WRONG.  I beat them every single day, and I have beaten them for over 4 years straight now, continually transferring money from their pocket to mine.  You don't have to be a genius yourself to beat them (although it can certainly help), you just need to know their strengths and weaknesses so you can wage asymmetric financial warfare against them.  You will never react to headlines as quick as them, you will never scalp arbitrage like they can, but you can absorb information and use that to deduce predictable human behavior like their algorithms can only dream of doing.   \n\nStop making excuses for the MM failures.  They are not gods and they can bleed just like you.  I know it's sad the poor ol' MM lost so much money to WSB, but in my eyes the MM are just getting a harsh lesson in \"The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.\"", "created_utc": 1584300565.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fj6y71/the_day_wsb_cucked_the_market_makers/", "is_self": true}
