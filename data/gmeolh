I'm simply trying to bring about statistical bias, not media bias, in the reporting of a study. A CNN [article](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/11/health/hydroxychloroquine-doesnt-work-coronavirus/index.html) posted recently mentioned how \"Hydroxychloroquine doesn't work for coronavirus\" the article they reference is [here](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2766117) The paper takes 1400 COVID-19 patients and exposes them to various treatments including and not including hydroxychloroquine. The study ends up concluding the mortality rates for the control group, along with each of the hydroxychloroquine groups, were similar. But if we dig deeper, we can see that they weren't administered to similar groups of people. The CNN article states that \"after ***statistical adjustments***, the death rate for patients taking hydroxychloroquine was similar to those who did not take the drug. The death rate for those taking hydroxychloroquine plus the antibiotic azithromycin was also similar.\" What's interesting is that statistical adjustments were actually not made, hence why in the research world this paper has been heavily discredited. In this study, the group treated with hydroxychloroquine was significantly more sick than the control group at baseline. According to the research published:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* \"Patients receiving hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin were overall sicker on presentation.\"\n* The information provided in Table 1 showed they were significantly sicker with multiple risk factors:\n* Black or Hispanic patients were more likely to receive hydroxychloroquine and/or azithromycin as treatment compared to the control group. Studies have shown that these groups of people, from a purely medical perspective, have an intrinsically higher mortality rate.\n* Patients receiving the hydroxychloroquine\u2009+\u2009azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine treatment alone were more likely to be obese and have diabetes.\n* Patients receiving hydroxychloroquine alone had the highest levels of chronic lung disease (25.1%) and cardiovascular conditions (36.5%).\n* The paper also mentions that \"those receiving hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, or both were more likely than those not receiving either drug to have diabetes, respiratory rate >22/min, abnormal chest imaging findings, Oxygen saturation lower than 90%, and aspartate aminotransferase greater than 40 U / L.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven after all of these disparities in groups, the mortality rates were similar in the end. CNN mentioned how \"the patients who took the drug combination were more than twice as likely to suffer cardiac arrest during the course of the study.\" This statistic fails to account for the fact that the patients receiving the drug combinations already had \"the highest levels of cardiovascular conditions.\"\n\nThe researchers mention how in the article, no conclusion can be made, personally I disagree with this given the fact that mortality rates ended up being similar even though their pre-existing conditions were disproportional. However, regardless, CNN (and I've seen MSNBC, NYTimes, Washington Post, and other news sources tout similar flawed studies), should not be misleading the public with a title that says that the drug does not work for hydroxychloroquine. The selection bias in the statistical study is one thing, but there is no excuse for selection bias in research papers by media sources.\n\nPeoples' lives are at stake, and if the media is going to continue to politicize research papers for their own political agenda, the authors of these papers have to speak out. I don't mean to single out CNN as like I mentioned earlier, multiple news sources do this. It's important to be educated on the matter. Media outlets will take advantage of the fact that most readers will only read headlines and will not actually go through the research publications referenced. For your own sake and health, please try your best to look past the politicization of these articles and read the papers themselves.\n\n**TL;DR:** People make bets on the news and wonder why the market goes in the opposite direction. Market Makers know that retail investors react emotionally to headlines rather than material and can take advantage of this. When you see a headline, look deeper into it before you make your decision and you'll realize more times than not, it's important to inverse the news because a lot of times when a news agency like CNN posts a negative article, it's usually because the Trump administration did something positive.\n\n**TL;DR TL;DR:** Inverse CNN. They're biased and push their narrative rather than facts. (This is why you rarely see good news on CNN and yet wonder why SPY is about to hit 300 from 220 a couple of months ago)\n\nSPY 300c 6/19.", "created_utc": 1589850851.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gmeolh/the_politicization_of_the_pandemic_in_the_media/", "is_self": true}
