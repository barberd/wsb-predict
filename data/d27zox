{"id": "d27zox", "title": "Kroger ($KR) is going to CRUSH earnings - DD inside", "selftext": "2019 has been a horrible year for the NFL so far.  After a officiating boner led to a never-should-have-been Super Bowl matchup that produced the lowest point total in the game's history, the league was subject to embarrassing headline after embarrassing headline during the offseason.  This included having an owner (Bobby \"Two-Strokes\" Kraft) arrested in a prostitution sting, having a star player's (Tyreek Hill) child removed from his home by Child Protective Services after allegations of abuse, two incredibly high profile early retirements due to the physical toll of the game (Rob Gronkowski, Andrew Luck), and a variety of contract disputes (Le'Veon Bell, Ezekiel Elliott, Melvin Gordon) that widened the already significant rift between players and owners heading into upcoming collective bargaining negotiations.\n\nIt's enough to make a man lose sleep at night.  And the man losing the most sleep is the man tasked with shepherding the NFL through the minefield of these issues year after year, its commissioner Roger Goodell.  Things can't be easy for Roger right now, but there's one company that has reached out to reassure him that the NFL can look forward to yet another successful season of minting money.  The company?  Kroger.  Its message?  It's right there in the name!\n\nKroger\n\n-&gt;\n\nK-Roger.\n\n--&gt;\n\nOK, Roger...\n\n---&gt;\n\n\"Everything's going to be OK, Roger.\"\n\n\nIn no uncertain terms, Kroger is telling Roger Goodell that he has nothing to worry about during this upcoming season of football.  They're letting him know that Americans are fatter than ever, have stuffed their larders full of beer, sausage, and cheese, and are gearing up to spend another fall season parked in front of their televisions, watching young men batter each other's brains into gooey cauldrons of molten CTE for their entertainment.  And Kroger has the receipts to prove it. \n\nLong $KR.", "created_utc": 1568124348, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d27zox/kroger_kr_is_going_to_crush_earnings_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
