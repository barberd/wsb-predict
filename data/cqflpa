{"id": "cqflpa", "title": "Levels to watch on SP500", "selftext": "I would add that last week we had an intra-day low of roughly 2775 on SP500 where we bounced really hard.  If you're short, these are some good levels to watch for potentially deciding when to close.  If you decide to go long, these would be some good levels to watch for as entry points.  If you're not in the markets and we bust through the 200 day moving average, that's a good level to go short SPY at.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/l2952tc17hg31.png", "created_utc": 1565815459, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cqflpa/levels_to_watch_on_sp500/", "is_self": true}
