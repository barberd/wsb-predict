Up 60% this past week, it\u2019s looking very tasty for the casual retard like me that does minimal research. I suspect it will continue to grow as it has \u201cMD\u201d in the name and doctors are never wrong and thus this stock is never wrong. Dump some money into it like me and ride the wave before it goes to high.\n\nHave a nice day hope this DD wasn\u2019t too analytical.", "created_utc": 1566234464, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/csk08y/inmd_easy_tendies/", "is_self": true}
