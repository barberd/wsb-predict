But. \n\nAm a continuing education/returning student (\u201cburnout\u201d) with no previous debt, no dependents, not much to lose, etc. \n\nStudied fine arts/did prereqs at JUCO, then dropped out when I wised up. Just need to finish literally any BA before those credits start to expire. \n\nI figure the art world has already prepared me for disappointment and loss of thousands of dollars gambled with terrible ROI, I have stone cold hands at this point and therefore the knowledge to profit in any market (like a cockroach). \n\nSo, Finance or Economics focus? I\u2019m asking the autists which is the better degree because I don\u2019t wanna get stuck with those bunch of Ally savings holding Mormons over at r/ investing. \n\nI want 2 fuck married women and complain about yacht fees. Help me accomplish my dreams. \n\nThe End", "created_utc": 1563921689, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cgzogy/how_many_of_you_have_had_success_trading_on/", "is_self": true}
