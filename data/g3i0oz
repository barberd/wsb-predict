Even if US shuts down for two years and we recover in the third, we should theoretically only lose 8%. \n\nWhat's not the same. \n\n1. Massive Fed intervention. Some companies would not survive this crisis, causing a chain reaction ultimately leading to bank failures. Now no one is going bankrupt. Empty hotels for a year? No problem, corporate bonds are basically guaranteed now.\n\n2. Rates going down, cheap leverage for the future, good for stocks.\n\nImagine if you had an ATM printing $4 for $100 dollar you give it, and that $4 grows say at 6% a year. It's been running for a 10 years, and then suddenly it stops working. You take it to the shop and they say that it's broken and may take a year to fix but the US government will instead pay you $10000 while you wait, are you going to sell the fucking ATM for $50? Fuck no. You are jack to the tits and you are going to acquire more ATMs.\n\nThat is all", "created_utc": 1587186458.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g3i0oz/why_stock_go_up_from_here/", "is_self": true}
