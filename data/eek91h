All the illustrations are only Disney characters.  Snow white, Mickey Mouse, the little mermaid and shit.  What's a guy going to choose with options like that?  He chooses the black Darth Vader one is what.\n\n Now everytime I go to Wendy's for tendies cashiers want to talk about star wars.  Like, what the hell. I didn't sign up for all these random conversations about a movie franchise I don't even watch because people assume you're a super fan with a personalized card.\n\nAll I could think was, wow great marketing Disney.  Nice way to get everyone talking about your movies even though people don't get a choice and it should be illegal. \n\nShort DIS. Their marketing is predatory and worse than wells Fargo.", "created_utc": 1577105558, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eek91h/short_dis/", "is_self": true}
