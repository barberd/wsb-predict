{"id": "fyh9u4", "title": "The Darkest Timeline: Part II - JPow and The Core", "selftext": "Yes, nothing makes sense in the markets right now.  Yes, JPow is buying anything that isn't anchored to the floor.   Yes, this is the equivalent of members of the Fed taking turns pooping in the collective lunchbox of wall street bears.\n\n(Possible unpopular opinion): it remains the right thing to do, and is likely one of the most important police actions of the century.\n\nThis is where the 2003 masterpiece \"The Core\" comes in.  I submit to you that JPow sat in a meeting at some point this year, and watched a big-brain back-office analyst burn a piece of fruit with some hairspray.  JPow then quickly and publicly promised \"unlimited\" QE.\n\nA few things to consider:\n\n* This does not appear to be an empty threat, as evidenced by my portfolio\n* There is no reason to risk the financial future of the United States, unless it prevents a catastrophe of equal or greater size\n* JPow worked previously to raise the debt ceiling, this is a man who understands the ramifications of what the Fed is doing right now\n* This, like suppressing wildfires, is not a long-term strategy, and \\*will\\* lead to larger oscillations of the markets\n* JPow knows all of this, and chose to do what he is doing, over other options that he deemed worse\n\nConsider the possibility that at some point this year, someone pulled a binder marked something like \"Financial Collapse - Biological\" off of a large shelf and dropped it on the desk of a manager at the Fed.   This binder made the way to JPow, who, as an practiced politician, a lawyer, a former college professor, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and father of 3, suddenly became a frightened man with a checkbook offering to pay whatever it costs.\n\nI don't know of any precedent for any of this.  I doubt JPow would want to be known as an alarmist, or as the guy with a rented truck filled with toner.\n\nConsider what possible scenarios are in that binder.  A virus leads to a financial collapse, which leads to panic, which leads to rioting, which leads to a breakdown of basic services, all of which continue to power the spread of a highly virulent pathogen.  This is a possible recipe for literally millions of deaths, the end of the United States as we know it, and a possible power vacuum that could destabilize other chunks of the world.  We are talking about one of the single worst disasters in the course of human history.\n\nWas that going to happen, possibly not, there are a lot of long shots that have to happen for that scenario to happen.  But clearly JPow set off a couple of nukes in an attempt to restart the liquid spinning core of the planet so that we would be safe from swarms of angry birds.  Does this mean that the planet is safe forever, no.\n\nI think we all know that this was a one-shot deal.  If they stop, it may not be convincing the second time.  I can't exactly say how long the Fed will be willing to do what it is doing.  There is no other sane course but to let the market collapse at some point.  My best guess is that QE will continue until 1) after the first wave of the beer virus crests, or 2) after a successful therapy is widely available or a vaccine has been administered to a significant percentage of the population.  I cannot fathom why they would do option 1 if they have come this far.\n\nRIP my positions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you missed it - Part I:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fsgiso/the\\_darkest\\_timeline\\_the\\_markets\\_and\\_idiocracy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fsgiso/the_darkest_timeline_the_markets_and_idiocracy/)", "created_utc": 1586530485.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fyh9u4/the_darkest_timeline_part_ii_jpow_and_the_core/", "is_self": true}
