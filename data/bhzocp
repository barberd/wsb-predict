{"id": "bhzocp", "title": "18 to 1 Reward to Risk ratio iron condor", "selftext": "So Thursday before the bell I put on an Iron Condor with strikes at the money (basically iron butterfly) on AMZN.  Short strikes were  1912.5 and 1915 and long strikes 1887.5 and 1940.  I sold 4 of these spreads.  This was on weekly options expiring day of earnings.  I noticed that I was showing max profit of $9,400 and max loss of around $500.  Is this normal for an AMZN iron condor/butterfly?  I was able to close out the position yesterday mid day for over $4,000 profit.  Wondering if I was extremely lucky that price stayed between strikes for a while or what?  An 18 to 1 reward risk ratio seems too good to be true.  Anyone else had a setup like this before?", "created_utc": 1556375882, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bhzocp/18_to_1_reward_to_risk_ratio_iron_condor/", "is_self": true}
