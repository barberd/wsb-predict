Obviously you'd tell to me fuck off, yet here I am long time lurker first time caller with a low risk/high reward talk for you. \n\n**The Plan**\n\nGM CEO The Virgin Mary Barra spoke on EV wednesday and announced their plans to beat Tesla at their own game. \nThe battery modules: Ultium, is going to lower the price of EVs while still pumping in profit for the company. The battery also has a longer range than Tesla models boasting a 400 mile range.\nThe Cars: 11 Future EVs have been released, they already have the Chevy Bolt. Announced was a Fully Self-Driving Cruise Origin, The Luxury SUV Cadillac Lyriq, and the fucking Electric hummer. A fucking hummer being unveiled on May 20th with production in Sept 2021.\nAs of right now Tesla sold 90% of the US's electric cars. GM is the only company with a tangible and easily obtainable that can take on take like no other company can\n\n**The Tendies**\n\nC'mon, guy, wheres the money? \n\nThis is not a short term plan. I'm not talking a next call strike up expiring 3/13. I talking Jan 2021/2022 calls. GM just hit a new 52 week low on Friday and could possible go lower this week too, the calls are fucking cheap. If your like me and lost 90% of your money between Mon-Tues in The Fuckening, this could be a long term pre-heat the oven and retrieve tendies when cooked.\n\n\n**Disclosure**\nAm I saying that GM is going to have insane runs like Papa Musk gave us in the last couple months, no. Do I think that GM has the potential to triple or quadruple in value, absolutely. Before you say it's just a car company, there's no way. So is Tesla, I think 60% of the reason Tesla is so successful is because of Musk. GM doesn't have a musk, they a 20 Billion plan to pump out EVs in the next coming years.\n\n[The Plans] (https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/03/04/gm-unveils-10-future-evs-new-batteries-and-its-plan-beat-tesla/4905906002/)\n\n(https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/04/business/gm-electric-car-battery-400-miles-of-range/index.html)", "created_utc": 1583680993, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffdycr/dd_electric_cars_2_general_motors_bugaloo/", "is_self": true}
