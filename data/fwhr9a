{"id": "fwhr9a", "title": "UK Formal Sale Processes, Difference between sell-side advisor and broker", "selftext": "Hi guys,\n\nWas just wondering if anyone could explain the difference between the companies who act as financial advisors vs those who act as brokers on the sale side in the UK? I\u2019ve been trying to educate myself on FSPs recently and have noticed that often times there will be either one or the other, or both. \n\nI had always thought the difference was mainly with regards to the size and scale of the company being sold, but is there a more meaningful difference in the approach each takes/the tasks they fulfil?\n\nThanks in advance for any help!", "created_utc": 1586253000.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fwhr9a/uk_formal_sale_processes_difference_between/", "is_self": true}
