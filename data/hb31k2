{"id": "hb31k2", "title": "PSA: Bankruptcy is an option", "selftext": "Dear retahds,\n\nBy now you've all heard the story of the autiste who committed sooeeeside after racking  up $700k in Robinhood debt.\n\nFirst of all, being short gamma with VIX over 40 is retarded. In the bad way.\n\nBut if you did that anyway, I want to remind you that you live in the United States of America. In the land of the free, we have abolished slavery, including debt slavery.\n\nDon't end your sorry little autiste life. It makes us sad. Instead, declare bankruptcy and your debt just goes away. You can legally tell Robinhood's risk management department to fuck off.\n\nYou can wipe out all your debts, so treat yourself to a nice little credit card shopping spree to celebrate the newfound strength of your will to live. In 7 years the bankruptcy will even be wiped off your credit score. By the time you are growing body hair, you will have a clean slate.\n\nUnfortunately, this deal doesn't apply to student loan debt because our society is a fucking scam.", "created_utc": 1592437314.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hb31k2/psa_bankruptcy_is_an_option/", "is_self": true}
