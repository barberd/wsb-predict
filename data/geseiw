In regards to the stock market it also **inflated** stocks that wouldn't have otherwise been where they are.\n\nI though it would be cool to make a list of stocks that only got bumps due to the coronavirus scare and the restriction responses by individual states, as these are most likely in most cases to fall back down to their older levels or head toward zero offering **free puts**.\n\nSo mention a fad stock that has only really come to attention due to Corona and why you think it should be added to the **list below.**\n\nI'll start with Zoom, it's really not going to go anywhere as the restrictions ease back, and new competition enters every day (ringcentral is now including video conferencing now for example) and it isn't a major earner so it will collapse overtime.\n\nI'll update the list frequently.\n\n# LIST OF FAD STOCKS:\n\n1.
