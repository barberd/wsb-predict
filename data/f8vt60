When was the last time you ever heard of something \"Made in China\"? Probably never.   \n\nNow you may ask: What about Korea and Japan, who face serious outbreaks? Japan and Korea are imaginary concepts to allow the Americans to enter WW2. They bombed their own base on Hawaii and then invented the story of some fictitious Asian country being responsible. But as we know Asian countries do not have any modern industry, could never defeat a western power in any kind of naval engagement and are irrelevant to the world economy as a whole.   \n\nConclusion: Other people are stupid and you are just too smart for the market by getting MSFT 300c 20/3 options. Other people have mental break downs and mumble something about \"severed supply chains\" (I mean why would a supply of chains even matter????), ramble about a \"Japanese recession\" or \"China, an integral part of our world economy, standing still\" and make up stories about cities touching the sky in places called Shengei, Hong Kang or Tokyoh. \n\nIts those irrational people who took away your tendies, not your misjudgement of the situation.", "created_utc": 1582569579, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f8vt60/remember_this_is_just_irrational_people_being/", "is_self": true}
