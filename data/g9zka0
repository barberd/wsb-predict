{"id": "g9zka0", "title": "BP is going bust in 1 quarter. CEO Bernard Looney is a greedy fuck", "selftext": "This report is shit: https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/investors.html\n\n\n They used Underlying Replacement Cost which is a Non-GAAP (basically accounting cancer to fool investors).\n\nAren't they legally obligated to publish balance sheet with GAAP measures? Where is the readable version without accounting cancer?\n\n\n\n\nAnyways they tried to hide but I found it, they lost 4,4B in first quarter of 2020.\n\n\nSo January and February should have been ok... Half of March was fucked and they publish 4.4B in losses in a cooked report trying to blame the Gulf oil Spill and FX rates? They still pay themselves 10.5 cents a share? FUCK THIS ADMINISTRATION.\n\nShort this cunts. They have 18,139M in cash 14000M is debt and leases, they are going to bust after next quarter.\n\nTomorrow I will make AMD.\n\nPS: I am noob. Bernard please don't sue, just pay less to you and your friends you stupid cunt.\n\nEdit2: They have net assets of 90B, they are loosing money at a fast pace, did shit profit in 2019, have a bleak future ahead and are still valued at a bit more than 70B. It you don't short it at least don't buy this.
