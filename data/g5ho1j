Results: The cohort (including 704 ivermectin treated and 704 controls) was derived from 169 hospitals across 3 continents with COVID-19 illness. The patients were matched for age, sex, race or ethnicity, comorbidities and a illness severity score (qSOFA). Of those requiring mechanical ventilation fewer patients died in the ivermectin group (7.3% versus 21.3%) and overall death rates were lower with ivermectin (1.4% versus 8.5%; HR 0.20 CI 95% 0.11-0.37, p<0.0001).\n\nWhy is this good? \n\n* 1 - This is a CONTROLLED study. This provides much stronger evidence than Remdesivir at the possible efficacy of ivermectin.\n\n* 2- Ivermectin dosage does NOT change in liver or kidney dysfunction: That means it will NOT become toxic in people with liver/kidney failure (like hydroxychloroquine). It's only contraindication is if you are specifically allergic to it.\n\nWhy should I care? It is sold under the brand name Stromectol, and produced by Merck. Merck's stock traded SIDEWAYS yesterday. Remember how Gilead stock shot up over 15% overnight off of a RUMOR?? This has strong evidence to do more than just maybe work, and it's not harsh on the system like an antiviral or choloroquinine.\n\nMRK manufactures Ivermectin for human use. This isn't just a horse dewormer. Might be some tendies here.\n\nTL;DR - MRK 90c 5/15 x30 contracts\n\nI think i got removed for marking this as DD and then turning up the memes too much so i'm trying again (i drew a batman it was awesome)", "created_utc": 1587484111.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5ho1j/ivermectin_trials_could_cause_a_surge_in_mrk/", "is_self": true}
