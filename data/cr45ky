A couple of months back I bought a GE put with a strike of $9.\n\nMy question is, what do I do now? I think I'm going to give this fraud thing a couple of days... maybe even a few weeks, but when it is time to sell, what exactly do I do? \n\nIt expires 9/20.\n\nAdvice is greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks.", "created_utc": 1565948933, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cr45ky/ge_put_now_in_the_money/", "is_self": true}
