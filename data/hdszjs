If you can't think or read, this tip is for you.\n\nLook at the bid ask spread and the volume. If there is a tremendous amount of volume, but the spread is still as wide as your mom's cheeks, then despite the illusion of liquidity, i.e. high volume, there is actually very LITTLE liquidity, hence why the price can be pushed around very easily. This is because MMs pussy out and aren''t going to provide significant  liquidity at the ask or bid. They are not going to fight the tape. Eventually, the pump stops because the flow of capital stop, early pumpers cash out, and similarly here, MM's aren't going to provide  meaningful liquidity at the bid on the way down either, same reason.\n\nYou can see this in NKLA and U1 right now.\n\nEdit: suck my dick mods this is more DD then all the DDs posted today", "created_utc": 1592834876.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hdszjs/the_only_real_technical_analysis_you_need/", "is_self": true}
