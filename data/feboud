Some facts need to be set straight. Note I'm only going to be talking only about the virus itself and it's medical impact, the economic impact and market movements will of course always be based on human emotions to perceived threats/misinformation and not necessarily reality.\n\nThere's a reason why China's market is already flying high while everyone else is tanking. *I suspect China's market has realized the coronavirus is not fundamentally going to disrupt anything in the long term in their working age population (they literally just got over their Covid outbreak and can see the low mortality effects) and are pricing that accordingly, which is why it is not sinking; of course their markets are also bolstered by government rules on selling.*\n\nThe mortality rate trumpeted by WHO right now is 3.4%. **This is a dramatic overestimation as there are so many infected people who are mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic and will never get tested.** The real mortality rate is likely going to be BELOW 0.6%. I would not be surprised if the true death rate is equivalent or less severe to seasonal flu (0.1%).\n\nEvidence:\n\n&gt;\"World Health Organisation Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Tuesday said the global mortality rate from Covid-19 recorded so far was about 3.4 per cent, higher than previous estimates - though this figure was accompanied by caveats that the rate could be lower when more was known about the disease.Yet in South Korea, where the country\u2019s Centres for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday reported 6,088 cases and 40 deaths, the mortality rate appears to be hovering around 0.65 per cent.\n\n[https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/health-environment/article/3065187/coronavirus-south-koreas-aggressive-testing-gives](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/health-environment/article/3065187/coronavirus-south-koreas-aggressive-testing-gives)\n\nAlso:\n\n&gt;\"For a more structured view of the new coronavirus\u2019s lethality, some scientists are pointing to the Diamond Princess cruise liner in Japan, where all passengers and staff were quarantined and closely followed. More than 707 people on the ship have caught the virus, with six deaths, or about 0.8%.\" [Source](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-06/coronavirus-s-true-lethal-power-still-eludes-disease-experts?srnd=premium/)\n\n**Keep in mind cruise ship passengers have a MEDIAN age of 60-69 (only 19% of cruise passengers are BELOW age 60).** [Source](https://www.cruise1st.co.uk/blog/cruise-holidays/how-old-is-the-average-cruise-passenger)\n\nYou can infer that a death rate of 0.8% in a heavily elderly cruise ship population only means the overall death rate is far far lower if you extend it to the general population median age:\n\n&gt;Deborah Birx, a coronavirus response coordinator, said at the press conference that data shows the elderly and those with preexisting health conditions are most vulnerable to the disease. Birx said that in South Korea, which has the largest outbreak outside of China, no one under the age of 30 has died from the disease.
