I\u2019ve noticed a lot of shit posting around the FED and how money machine can only go brrrr brrrr for so long so you\u2019re puts must print eventually! Global economy is heading into the shitter 100%. Here\u2019s why your most likely going to be shit out of luck. \n\nThe day is Nov 25, 2008 the US has been in economic free fall sense October 2007 what does our glorious FED choose to do? They announced the purchase of the direct obligations of housing-related government-sponsored enterprises or GSEs and the Federal Home Loan Banks and mortgage-backed securities or MBS\n\nSome time passes markets continue downward trend and on December 16 2008 the Fed evaluates benefits of purchasing longer-term Treasury Securities\n\nMore downward trending however the fed comes out Jan 28 2009 to discusses expanding program\n\nNow here is the important part Autists so pay attention-BOTTOM IS HIT February 2009-\n[Fig 1](https://imgur.com/gallery/04NLWzR)\n\nMarkets are bouncing a little bit the Fed says not good enough on Mar 16, 2009 Fed expands MBS program to $1.25 trillion. They buy up to $300 billion of longer-term Treasury securities.\n\nNow here\u2019s an important date for you all Mar 31, 2010, initial QE is terminated. What do we see? Market isn\u2019t to happy when Fed cuts the support, continues to fall for a couple of months [Fig 2](https://imgur.com/gallery/8ZfXw4t)\n\nWhat does the fed do to respond Aug 27, 2010 Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke hints at return QE back in some manner. Next month market recorrects and returns to positive growth.\n[Fig 3](https://imgur.com/gallery/5hCbTTb)\n\nSo what does this all mean? While I\u2019m no expert (seriously I got like 2 brain cells and dyslexia) I do think they\u2019re is a trend that we can spot. Market responds well to QE, markets responds even better to unlimited QE. While this pandemic is different then the housing crash the principle is the same, once the Fed starts handing out cash the market goes up. If they cut that funding we will of course see a rebalancing event, but the fed learned its lesson and it ain\u2019t takin its foot off the pedal tell we at record high ATHs. Does this mean we are on track for Dow 30k, no but the fed is going to make damn sure we don\u2019t trend below all time lows. If you want to bet against the Fed be my guest but ask all the guys in 2010-2015 saying \u201cjust wait the crash is coming soon, just one more day and we drop 30%\u201d how well their bet went.\n\nTLDR: You know you can buy calls right?
