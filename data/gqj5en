{"id": "gqj5en", "title": "Bear Porn: Speculating what might cause the next downturn", "selftext": "There's been plenty of speculation on this sub as to what might cause the next correction. Common points of discussion include defaults of CLOs, a [global food shortage](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-13/un-seeks-more-funds-to-fight-locusts-with-crisis-far-from-over), and a second corna wave which might lead to even higher unemployment. Plenty of \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b porn to go around.\n\nEveryone knows that this rally has been driven entirely by tech - just look at the [$NDX vs. the $SPX](https://imgur.com/a/5qq5C96). This isn't surprising to anyone; I mean shit, tech has been doing [*really really good right now*](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/04/big-techs-earnings-prove-its-immune-to-the-coronavirus.html)*,* meanwhile the S&P (ex. FAGMANN) has essentially bottomed out. This begs the question: what might cause another correction to form in the S&P (and NDX)?\n\nI was reading [this article](https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2020/05/25/the-new-depression-covid-19-and-stocks-rightful-owners/) published to the CFAI blog, and this quote specifically grabbed my attention:\n\n>*The last and most alarming mechanism of this upward redistribution: \u201ccashout leakages\u201d from workers withdrawing plan balances consequent to job changes, non-repaid loans, and, critically, emergencies such as job loss and medical expenses. A 2015 CRR paper estimated this leakage at around 1.5% per annum, or about 25% over the span of total employee participation.These cashout leakages will become a flood. As I write, millions of Americans, newly out of work due to the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, have come face to face with the cruel mistress of financial destitution.* ***The luckier among them will stave off ruin by liquidating what little assets they have, mainly in the form of their 401(k) and IRA accounts. Other small investors, both inside and outside retirement plans, while not immediately threatened by penury, will sell their equities in panic***\\*.\\* *One does not have to venture too far into the social media sphere to see evidence of this.*\n\nNow, as we know FAGMANN is a cornerstone to just about any money-manager's portfolio. I don't have data to back up how concentrated institutions are to FAGMANN, but I think it's safe to say that it's pretty damn concentrated.\n\nThe point of discussion that I wanted to throw out there is this: juiced up unemployment benefits end [July 31](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/04/unemployment-benefits-will-be-reduced-after-july-31.html), the extension of which appears to be [contentious to say the least](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/congressional-republicans-and-white-house-fear-pandemic-unemployment-benefits-are-a-barrier-to-getting-people-back-to-work-2020-05-22). Assuming unemployment benefits aren't extended and we as a nation aren't able to return to full employment (e.g., further job loss/white-collar furloughs becoming permanent), could we see a mass exodus of money from [rent-burdened](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gpvbgk/conversations_with_vegas_hotels_and_other/) retail investors, concentrated around areas like NYC and SF, in what could be a wide-spread liquidation event of retirement accounts? Effectively a retail investor \"bank run\"?\n\nCounterpoint: I know retail investors make up a significantly smaller portion of trading volume vs. institutions, but I'm still curious of how, assuming there were a \"bank run\", it would affect FAGMANN and the general market.\n\nCounterpoint 2: Relating to the link to yesterday's post, I'm not saying we're going to see millions of homeless in NYC, a quick [Google search](https://wherewelive.cityofnewyork.us/explore-data/housing-conditions/) will show you that nearly half of the city is already rent-burdened. I don't see how the coronavirus pandemic hasn't exacerbated this.\n\nThese are just my thoughts.", "created_utc": 1590440106.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gqj5en/bear_porn_speculating_what_might_cause_the_next/", "is_self": true}
