{"id": "gpu350", "title": "Unusual Options Activity for Lam Research $LRCX", "selftext": "Lam Research is a major [semiconductor processing equipment maker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lam_Research)\n\n[Moderate new bullish activity for 5/29, from 5/22](https://i.imgur.com/acxvGqo.png)\n\n[New 1DTE open interest for 5/22 from the day prior](https://i.imgur.com/JwEI5oY.png).  It didn't work out then, as tech stocks continued to be weighed down by China trade tensions, but it seems these options buyers were not discouraged, and are trying again this week.\n\n[Overall, the call/put ratio seems strongly in favor of calls for 5/29](https://i.imgur.com/NTW5ERV.png). **<---Tl;dr**\n\n[20D Chart](https://i.imgur.com/zOeBfJo.png)\n\n\n\nIs this someone trading on an expected announcement or new development for Lam?  \n\nSome scenarios:\n\n1) Could Lam Research benefit by a move out of China by the semiconductor equipment industry?  \n\nIn trying to come up with scenarios, it's worth noting that with the current trade war, Lam is a US-based company, with [88%](http://archive.is/Gb9Fd) of its facilities in the US.  However, [none of the biggest semiconductor equipment suppliers are Chinese](https://www.statista.com/statistics/267392/market-share-of-semiconductor-equipment-manufacturers/), so there's no obvious reason why LRCX in particular would benefit at the expense of a competitor.  Competitor Applied Materials is 90% based in the US.  [ASML is not particularly beholden to China](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asml-results/asml-sees-no-impact-from-china-trade-war-good-growth-in-2020-idUSKBN1ZL1YQ).  Tokyo Electron has no China chip equipment facilities [and is honoring the US's chipmaker blacklist](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-semiconductors-exclus/exclusive-top-japanese-chip-gear-firm-to-honor-us-blacklist-of-chinese-firms-executive-idUSKCN1TC0H6).  KLA Tencor [is another US based company like Lam](https://www.ft.com/content/4a8553a6-f3b2-11e8-ae55-df4bf40f9d0d).\n\nOn May 15, the Trump Administration implemented [new measures to restrict American IP and technology making its way to Huawei](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Huawei-crackdown/TSMC-halts-new-Huawei-orders-after-US-tightens-restrictions).  On a likely related note, the Taiwanese chipmaking company TSMC recently announced it is building a big new plant in the US.  TSMC is a Lam customer.  The announcement of TSMC's new foundry lead to a spike in chipmaking stocks [including LRCX](http://archive.is/WnZ18).  However, the very next day the new restrictions on Huawei went out, and [LRCX dove right back down](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/chip-stocks-slump-following-new-huawei-restrictions-tsmc-announcement) (see [chart](https://i.imgur.com/f2h9mPx.png)).\n\nBut perhaps another similar announcement will encourage investors again.\n\n[This 2019 article forecasts AI and IoT fueling growth in new chip designs, with India as a center](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/trend-tracking/ai-iot-fuel-new-chip-designs-and-india-is-at-the-centre-of-it/articleshow/69951739.cms).  Perhaps big new facilities being built somewhere like India as a result of an out-of-China movement will provide Lam Research with a new sales boom, just like the AZ plant notice did?\n\n2) Finding new ways to evade US sanctions could boost LRCX \n\n[This 2019 forecast](https://www.semi.org/sites/semi.org/files/2019-12/EMDS_Chart_800px.png), from [here](https://www.printedelectronicsnow.com/contents/view_breaking-news/2019-12-12/semi-releases-global-semiconductor-equipment-sales-forecast/), forecasts Taiwan and North America as the big winners for semiconductor equipment manufacturing in 2020:\n\n>Taiwan will dethrone Korea as the largest equipment market and lead the world with 53.3% growth this year, followed by North America with a 33.6% uptick. China will maintain the second spot for the second consecutive year, and Korea will fall to third after throttling back capital expenditures. All regions tracked except Taiwan and North America will contract this year.\n\n>SEMI expects the 2020 equipment market recovery to be fueled by advanced logic and foundry, new projects in China, and, to a lesser extent, memory. In Europe, equipment sales will surge by 45.9% to $3.3 billion. Taiwan is forecast to remain the top equipment market next year on the strength of $15.4 billion in sales, with China second at $14.9 billion and Korea third at $10.3 billion.\n\nWorth noting [Lam Research is considering a move of its R&D to Korea (2019 article)](http://www.theinvestor.co.kr/view.php?ud=20190919000763).  This could help them evade restrictions of export of American R&D to China, because it would now be Korean R&D.\n\n3) Secular growth in chip sector due to AI, big data etc, as demonstrated by Nvidia's continued strength (this [article from February on Nvidia's earnings beat could be copy-pasted to this past week after another Nvidia earnings beat](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-shares-surge-signs-machine-133600859.html)).  Again, an announcement of a new partnership with the likes of Nvidia would definitely drive LRCX up.\n\n\n4) This is a YOLO play by someone with deep pockets.  It does strike me as odd why they would try repeatedly after saccing tens of thousands last week, if they were just doing this on spec.  So if anyone think's it's this, please speak up.\n\n---\n\nI wrote this out as kind of an exercise, I know the options activity isn't crazy huge, but it does seem persistent and directional, so I wanted to try to understand what could be going on.", "created_utc": 1590342904.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gpu350/unusual_options_activity_for_lam_research_lrcx/", "is_self": true}
