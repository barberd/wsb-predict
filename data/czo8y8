{"id": "czo8y8", "title": "Long OLLI", "selftext": "Okay fellow autists, here's the deal: buy Olli calls.\n\nAs many of you know, Olli dropped 20 points last week from their quarterly earnings call. \n\nOn the 28th they released their quarterly earnings and surprise surprise same-store sales were down %1, the stock went down from 77 points to 56 over night. However, this was really expected by many considering the rapid growth they've had by taking over the leases of the old toys-r-us buildings (rip) and they've been expanding like crazy on all fronts. Sales growth is actually up 16% nationwide for this quarter and similar bargain stores like DG stock is also going up like crazy. I just don't see how this stock doesn't go back up within a month.\n\nMany people aren't realizing that the same exact type of drop happened back in December of 2018, 86 points dec 4th, down to 71 dec 5th. Thats a 15 point drop.. The stock was back up to 88 in Feb. Which is the exact reason why I'm longing Olli because at the very least they're super undervalued and many analysts agree that this stock will be back up over 75 which a months time.. The 20 point drop was an overreaction to slightly bad news, however, Olli still holds incredible value and I wouldn't be surprised to see them jump back up over 70 within a week or two.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me know what you think, do you agree with my choice to long Olli?", "created_utc": 1567619360, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/czo8y8/long_olli/", "is_self": true}
