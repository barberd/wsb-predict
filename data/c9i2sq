I hope the usual fags on this sub still hate me though and I will be shitposting the rest of the day and on the weekend.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm tired of the **NVDA** meme, sold out for gains and fuck that stock for a while.  I'm keeping some cash from that allocation but I took very sizable (for me) positions in the following:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.  **SNPS** \\- Synopsys.  I can't not be in semis because I'm an autie degen, but Synopsys is the \"top pick\" from a semi analyst I like and I've been following for a while.  They raise guidance like clockwork and bulldoze up.  $20Bn mkt cap, I see some upside.  **I have never once seen this name talked about on this sub.**  This is a long term hold.\n2. **XPER** \\- Xperi.  Without going into it too much, these guys are a somewhat recent business combination of two other firms and they have some shit going on - adoption of ASC 606 fucked their contract revenue recognition.  But they make a shitload of money.  This is a $1Bn mkt cap semi with massive upside.  I'm long shares and Dec $25Cs.  This is a long term hold.  Options are way OTM (rare for me) but smaller position, will roll up and out if I get the chance.\n3. **LMT 8/16 $320C**.  You guys know LMT.  Fucking long 'Murica, long Mango, long Missiles.  I like deep ITM, keep delta close to 1, don't lose your fucking shit on a big play going OTM.  I'll \\*probably\\* sell thses before earnings (wink).\n4. **WM 1/17/2020 $90C**.  Long Tony Soprano.  You don't have to meme all the time my bois.  Looking at these, $90Cs for like any month from August to Jan were the same price.  Maybe I'm an autistic and missing something, or maybe these are a good buy.  We will find out.  Plan with these is to roll up and out should I have some gainz.\n5. **Short VXX as always** on a spike.  I didn't, but you could today, look at VIX increase vs VXX, this is the steep contango board I talked about  here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c8b89l/short\\_the\\_vix\\_no\\_really/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c8b89l/short_the_vix_no_really/)  .\n6. **Other trades I made**:  After selling NVDA I wrote 2 puts at a lower strike - $152.5 for next week.  Just a little premium.  Writing CRM puts for next week too.  Probably $155s.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nProbably won't make anymore trades today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't usually go long options, usually short, and usually spreads, but in this low vol environment, buying options isn't so bad.  Go deep ITM and far out, pick low IV stocks, and you won't lose your shit.  Won't be a 100:1 lotto ticket, but you won't need to ask your boyfriend for a loan until your next paycheque either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Thanks bois, and from the bottom of my heart T4P**.", "created_utc": 1562344746, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c9i2sq/trade_ideas_for_today_752019/", "is_self": true}
