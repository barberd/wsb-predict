{"id": "gooycn", "title": "Zoom lawsuits and user decline imminent, set Puts for June or July for maximum gains. Detailed DD inside.", "selftext": "As a person that works with lawyers and the police you have lots of connections with your regions cases as well as any cases from other parts of the country due to contracts or major firms having branches in other cities and/or states.\n\nZoom is shortly, and in the future, having ***multiple court cases*** based on the companies operations, not just with the app itself, but misleading information, breaking contracts, deal retaliation, lying about certain aspects of their company and other issues.\n\nHowever, this is not what will cause the stock price to fall but rather help the primary reason. One thing about preparing cases is you get tons of information from inquires and investigations on both sides of the case, and the significant amount of \"looking into\" whether it's for a lawsuit or considering lawsuit, Zooms operations has revealed one thing that colleagues of mine and others in the field have brought to my attention.\n\n**Zoom numbers are falling at a brisk pace**. For every company or \"celebrity\" that uses zoom pushed by the media, Zooms prospects drop with a declining customer base that is abandon, or switching providers. This is the only data point that is completely common regardless of the reason for lawyers or others digging into the company in preparation for court.\n\nSure, Zoom losing some of these cases may drop the price, if they get on the news and some will, but once people start accusing zoom of inflation and start contrasting x company or celebrity using zoom with another announcement of zoom have an X% decline, people are going to realize that this stock doesn't have a platform to stand on, and the lawsuits will just cause a major panic.\n\nWe are already near the end of may so we can be seeing this happen within June or mid to early July, so those would be when to put your puts in order (I'm doing July to be safe.). I wouldn't recommend calls even in the short term because you're likely going to see organizations and firms slowly pull out as they will be the first to start panicking and you'll notice the gradually sudden decline in Zoom stock. As that grows your time is running out to jump in.\n\nSo definitely get those puts ready because Zoom is going to crash, although it probably may stay around $30-$40 though since they do have infrastructure, kind of, so it's not going to be a penny stock unless the amount of lawsuits and the consequences of those lawsuits are enough in number to cause a massive flight.", "created_utc": 1590172256.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gooycn/zoom_lawsuits_and_user_decline_imminent_set_puts/", "is_self": true}
