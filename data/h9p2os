After all the things that have happened recently from the hordes of unemployed investors that just installed Robinhood, to the gamblers who are out there gambling with their rent/stimulus money, I wanted to make a post on my view of how markets are currently functioning now, why retail will lose on average, why you should probably keep trading or investing, and why public exchanges should be public. I am definitely not a professional but I do like the markets that we have, bash me if you want to.\n\nYou can skip through to the payment for order flow part, but the first part is there for the newbies haven't learned basic market mechanics yet, I kinda need this to show why I believe the broker-dealer structure is broken. Skip if you just want to yolo and don\u2019t really care about inequality ingrained into market structures.\n\n*Copied Disclaimer from* [u/AsoftEngStudent](https://www.reddit.com/u/AsoftEngStudent/) *- This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion.

In derivatives/options, you\u2019re probably buying lottery tickets or selling high risk insurance, you make money when you think the lottery tickets are mis-priced.\n\nIn larger equity funds (SPY), your taking on society\u2019s risk that the world won\u2019t be plunged into chaos, and you make money when it doesn\u2019t fall into chaos. Generally falling into chaos results in negative returns for investors and less money for traders due to decreased need for people to trade with (liquidity).\n\nIn all of these you can either try to pawn off the contract as soon as possible on another person for profit or hold it until you think it\u2019s reached where it\u2019s supposed to be. Doing any of these things in practice is really difficult but also intrinsically fun. In the end though, what your doing is expressing a view on something that you think is better, something that might make you rich, or in something that you believe in. Generally, the public buys these on secondary exchanges, the original owners bought them via IPO\u2019s or some other underwriting procedure.\n\n**Trading is a zero sum game**\n\nWhile in investing you get stuff like dividends that makes the game positive sum, when trading in a fixed space of time you have to compete with other traders to determine the best price. In the simplest way, when I buy from someone, I profit if the stock goes up within my time/range and the other guy loses. Those who are good or lucky keep trading, those who aren\u2019t stop trading, those who gamble keep coming back for more, and those that retail trade futures or options get crushed into oblivion from the leveraged negative sum game.\n\n**Broker/Dealers/Clearinghouses and How They Make Money**\n\nOkay so you want to trade, how the fuck do I trade, there\u2019s this dude on the street handing out cards for this thing that says Robinhood, that's a famous thief btw, and I don\u2019t have to pay anything to play. *GREAT LETS GO.*\n\nThese apps are great in that they provide an easy way to invest/trade and offer the relationships between brokers, dealers, exchanges, and clearinghouses.\n\nBroker\u2019s are front-line people you call/lookup up to buy or sell an asset, or sometimes they call you, and they\u2019ll quote you some prices. Dealer\u2019s offer market immediacy meaning that when you want to buy there\u2019s someone there to take your money for the contract. Clearinghouses pretty much look at your financials and say hey this chick has money that she\u2019s good for, so let her trade. The exchange is a place with some rules on how to trade so people aren\u2019t complete jerks, many lease and sell seats for the right for people to trade on.\n\nAll of these traders make money off some sort of commission. Brokers make money off commissions. Exchanges make money off commissions and seats. Dealer\u2019s make money off their bid-ask spread, they will take your order at a certain time with the expectation that they can pawn off that contract on someone else in the very near future. Dealer\u2019s like it when the people trading with them are uninformed of their views or the current consensus since that makes them money in the long run.\n\n\\*Dealer networks, public/private exchanges, exchange seats, market fragmentation/consolidation are also very important but I just want to talk about this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**My Main Point - For Those That Want To Profit or See to The Welfare of Society**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Broker Dealers and Payment for Order Flow**\n\nNow this all sounds great right, the entire broker-dealer structure. If your not a complete non-competing sucker you probably already know all this. One question you might ask is hey, if all these guys need to make commissions how can they offer up free no commission trades to the uninformed public ala Robinhood or other retail investor platforms. The main answer to this is payment for order flow, where a broker sell their orders to another trader (usually a hedge fund or institution) where they act as the dealer in the transaction, holding the orders from the broker and either making a market or taking the other side of the trade it in the hope of profit.\n\nOkay so you get commission free trades, but in aggregate you\u2019re giving your money to someone who really wants you to lose since they make money when you lose, and now that you\u2019ve given them all of society\u2019s money and they have sufficient volume to actually move the price. If your in something where you're leveraged and can get margin called (your loans aren\u2019t good anymore) this is **REALLY DANGEROUS**. This is why trying to beat the banks and other institutions is beyond asinine via some retail platform vs direct market access, how can you beat someone when you are giving them you\u2019re money, it literally takes money from the public and gives it to people who determine the consensus. This is one part of a practice called internalization, and is highly scrutinized partially because it incentives brokers to forward their orders to the highest paying dealer/market-maker, and much more importantly it introduces systematic risk by giving all the public risk to a select few highest bidding institutions instead of having it spread out across everyone equally in public markets. When I lose my money I want to be losing it individually because I\u2019m the idiot, not systematically because there are traders who can\u2019t or won\u2019t take the risk.\n\n**Mutual Funds and Broker Dealers**\n\nYou can say similar things about investing in mutual funds, except that\u2019s not quite as idiotic since there\u2019s positive expected return on a portfolio of companies that are actually generating cash to give back to you, unlike bankrupt Hertz. However, by gambling your money into one large pile for someone else to gamble (mutual fund) the risk is now completely spread onto that singular broker-dealer managing that fund. If you lose money stuff gets pretty fucking dark because now everyone\u2019s losing money, and investors might pull out in a panic. A similar trend appears in the SPY, when Warren Buffet tells you to go buy the $VOO he actually has a profit motive since Berkshire Hathaway is in the index. I think that $VOO/$SPY is still important for diversification, but some percentage of ESG ETFs (maybe 30%-60%) might be a better option so your not handing over money to other people that might eventually take back the public's money like Exxon or Amazon.\n\n**More Opinion and Some Fucking Compassion**\n\nI\u2019m not saying that this is a bad thing, or that it\u2019s definitely happening, or that the SEC isn\u2019t regulating broker-dealers, or that I'm trying to start some kind of conspiracy theory, or that your orders aren\u2019t actually getting executed at the price their supposed to (but they probably at least have been in the past). But giving someone this kind of power seems like a not so smart thing to do especially right now when financial pundits are out insulting retail investors that are providing liquidity in a time of risk, regardless of whether you think it\u2019s a bubble or not. Many who are just desperately peddling for money to continue their lives in the midst of a pandemic.\n\nLabeled \u201cmillennial day traders\u201d and \u201cwe have to wait until they get blow out\u201d. With current outages at brokers, retail traders not given the option of getting out of futures positions during the oil crash, and again the complete disregard for the people that these companies and institutions are supposed to serve maybe its time to think about ways to solve this problem. Small owners of wealth in this system need to hand over their wealth over to larger institutions to express their views, and often these views are opposed to each other. More importantly I don\u2019t think that the financial system has to carry the entire burden of the risk assigned to it, there are literally people signing up to take this risk as I\u2019m writing this.\n\nThis is important because these issues mean that our free market is not healthy, the heart of the way wealth is created, destroyed, and transferred to working productivity is not functioning, at the very least it may not be transparent enough for the public to be able to either confirm or deny its effectiveness. Even as a Democrat and interventionist I believe that this is a problem. I believe in J. Powell\u2019s printer going BRRRRR and I would vote that is working very well at the moment given the alternatives.\n\nWhat I think is needed is for the financial experts who are trusted with the well being of our economic health, to share the risk, take a greater role in educating the public and take a step back from trying to manage all of that risk on their own, often summarized as forecasting the future. None of these ideas are new, but given the increasing relevance of the $ROPE meme and an incident where someone was able to take out $700,000 in leverage apparently past the possible issuer of the loan, the clearinghouse, broker, dealer, and the people who eventually took the other side of that trade is not acceptable on any side and deserves some fucking compassion.\n\nOne solution is to get exchanges to compete directly with brokers-dealers for public order flow, meaning they offer platforms connected directly to the exchange. Brokers and dealers are middlemen that do not need to exist in the age of the internet. Making the public exchanges truly public by adding infinite open retail seats at reasonable commission, and allowing the public to openly trade on them along with the help of clearinghouses to ensure safety is a pretty good option in my opinion. Traders will find renewed interest in the markets, advisors will have more clients, exchanges will receive increased commission, current broker dealers will be forced to compete within this structure, and the public will know better what they are buying and have a personal stake in its future instead of having the world\u2019s equity owned buy large players at least in some markets.\n\nI could make arguments about how quantitative easing transfers the wealth from the young and poor to those who are wealthy and elderly but frankly I don\u2019t give a shit. One of the core beliefs of capitalism is that you have a vote via your productivity and the system we have rejects our votes, and that people may not be voting in their best interests due either to ignorance, boredom, or more likely the current state of desperation. The public's faith in capital markets is actually what enables capital markets. Instead there's a bunch of new traders who in there desperation are turning to the markets to actually provide them something by fucking gambling. I'm concerned that the systems that we have in place has no faith because it deserves no faith, that opportunity is met with monopoly, and that capital is not being allocated to where it is most needed for the future.\n\nBut I\u2019m also just some random willfully ignorant upset guy on the internet, I am not a financial expert and would be happy to hear something on this, because currently I\u2019m in my parent\u2019s house looking for a job legitimately eating something close to tendies and while I\u2019m posting this on [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/).", "created_utc": 1592255719.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h9p2os/nddd_the_brokerdealer_structure_is_broken_why_you/", "is_self": true}
