That's a lot of face peels, cheek implants, botox and hair plugs for sure.\n\nLord Elon has been taking out massive cash loans from big banks like GS & MS using his $TSLA shares as collateral so he can keep the endless Portuguese snowblowers with whatever smoking hot babe he has on his arm at the time going.\n\nGoldman and Morgan Stanley are now puckering their butt holes at the current business climate, thinking to themselves, holy fuck , in our cocaine and alcohol fueled stupor we loaned Elontastic like almost a billion dollars, and took his TSLA shares as collateral, which was fucking great in December and January but fuck me, these could be worthless soon.. l think were fucked. Unless... if Muskaroonie can get that b-b-b-billion dollar bonus based on Tesla's stockprice, we could pull out of this, get our loans paid back and maybe have some left over for a nice eightball, truck stop hookers and 2 hours at a interstate motel.\n\nGS and MS have a vested interest in Musk's ability to collateralize and repay his blow loans. His biggest asset is the value of his TSLA shares. GS & MS plan on keeping those shares elevated at least until May 1st.", "created_utc": 1587413950.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g50d7l/why_tsla_price_is_dislocated_from_reality_for_at/", "is_self": true}
