{"id": "hgnbqv", "title": "Why next week go Brrrr", "selftext": "The VIX did not keep pace on the Wed/Fri dip with where it was on June 11. Or even where it was the week of the 19th during flat days. \n\nMuted VIX (relative to March and October 2008 dumps) + selloff in early March 2009 presaged the big rally.\n\nHere is a strikingly parallel example from 2010 that played out much like early 2020 (the Greek Debt Scare). As you can see, the second (really the third) spike in the VIX did not keep pace with the first and so the second dip in SPY was shallow as well. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/WnndZQj\n\nHere you can see your current situation where it's clear the VIX peaked the week of June 8 which implies the market bottomed that week too. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/3DSxB33\n\nThat weakness in the VIX/SPY ratio implies a green week next week. Normally, this far into a real dump, you'd see the VIX spiking, not falling.\n\nTwo possibilities: \n\n1. Stimulus talks could begin next week; \n2. MRNA's Phase 2 results due in the next few weeks. \n\nFor some reason, MRNA moves the markets more than INO or AZN.", "created_utc": 1593233126.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hgnbqv/why_next_week_go_brrrr/", "is_self": true}
