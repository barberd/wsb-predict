On my defense, everyone has said that if the Fed is buying corporate paper, they are buying LQD. Well, LQD is trading below NAV. It did all fucking day Friday. The whole god damn day. Not one buy to push it above NAV. So Fed is obviously not buying this bag of shit. How retarded or gay bear am I?\n\nSecondly, Fed said banks would have PPP loans available last Friday.
