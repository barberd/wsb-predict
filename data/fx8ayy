I sell the 267 call for $2.02.\n\nSo I am risking $43 to gain a max of $57 at expiration, leaving me with $100. The risk to reward ratio is 57 / 43 = 1.325\n\nSay I have 2:1 leverage, margin, buying power, whatever. With $43 I can instead buy two spreads. If the option expires in the money, I have $200. If it expires worthless, I have lost $86. The risk to reward is now 157 / 86 = 1.825.\n\nIncreasing the leverage seems to make things more and more favourable.\n\nAm I missing something fundamental about how this works? I understand that CBOE margin requirements offer no buying power reduction for spreads like this. Is it because it is an infinite money cheat code?\n\nPositions: a load of OTM ES options exipring Monday.", "created_utc": 1586359187.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fx8ayy/buying_options_on_margin/", "is_self": true}
