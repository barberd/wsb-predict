I\u2019m extremely new as far as investing in the market but I thought it was strange nonetheless. I read through the comment section and someone posted a link of an article that showed GE dip shortly after the CEO bought stock last time. So i figured what the hell its worth a shot. $37 an option at the time, woke up this morning to this story and was surprised. \n\nI have a question though since I\u2019m extremely new. If i hold on to these contracts, expiration date is 1/17/20, and it dips down to say the $1-$2 range will that contract be hard to close out? Or should I get out sooner.", "created_utc": 1565932432, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cr1s0f/let_it_ride_longer_or_cash_out_now/", "is_self": true}
