{"id": "g59uel", "title": "Battle of Wits", "selftext": "Alright autists, I challenge you to a battle of wits.\n\nFor the Tendies.\n\nTo the death.\n\nLet's pour the wine and think this one through.\n\nWe just saw a massive long squeeze right before contract expiration on WTI crude. Right now the volume on the June contract is massive, and we know that most of that volume is speculators that don't want to take or make delivery, so most of them have to exit their trade the opposite way in the next month.\n\nNow, here's the question, are they buying or selling right now? \n\nIf they all think we're going to see a repeat of yesterday right before this contract expires, they're selling right now. But that would mean a massive short squeeze right before contract expiration as they all tried to buy to close at the same time and the price jumps to $70+ per barrel. So, we being the clever autists that we are should actually buy contracts right now and bleed the shit out of them just before expiration.\n\nHowever, a huge chunk of the volume is just ETF's and I don't know if they can short. I think they take r/investing's money and buy long no matter what, meaning they have to sell to close and we see another price collapse. Making selling now and buying to close just before expiration the freest tendies ever given unto man.\n\nSo, which cup contains the poison? The battle of wits has begun and it ends when you click buy or sell on your CLM20 contract.", "created_utc": 1587449262.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g59uel/battle_of_wits/", "is_self": true}
