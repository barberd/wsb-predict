Can\u2019t find any reasons for the sudden huge drop in price, so Im thinking it\u2019s just a correction for really high gains. Am I crazy for buying on this dip? I figure peloton will be a huge holiday gift this year esp with their newish layaway pricing and blood-curdlingly expensive treadmill that would be the envy of any cul-de-sac. Might just YOLO the shit outta PTON rn, what are other\u2019s thoughts??", "created_utc": 1574276249, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dz6huq/what_the_fuck_is_with_peloton/", "is_self": true}
