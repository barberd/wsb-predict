So what do you do? Spread it out into four banks? And then 8 once your money grows? No that\u2019s not what millionaires do. Most higher a financial planner and if they don\u2019t it\u2019s bc they know what to do and that is buy USA Treasurys and that is bc the United States of America has never defaulted on a debt payment. Other countries like Germany and the U.K. defaulted in ww2 and before. All countries except for the US don\u2019t have a perfect record. \n\nIn order to buy US treasuries you need dollars. So if you are from another country and want to keep your money the safest it can be you need to transfer your foreign currency to US dollars (which increases the demand for US dollars sending the value of the dollar up) in order to buy US treasuries. This is why the Dollar is the \u201cReserve\u201d currency of the world. It\u2019s not bc anyone said it has to be it is where the demand lies. \n\nAll of the shit about bitcoin drives me nuts bc if you understand this then you wouldn\u2019t care much about bitcoin.
