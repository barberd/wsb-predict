{"id": "g1hfyd", "title": "USO prices April 15 - May 5", "selftext": "For anybody interested, now that USO has rolled over from their May to Jun contracts - they hold 129,354 JUN '20 contracts. \u00a0\n\nObviously USO is now following [June oil prices](https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/CLM20/overview). \u00a0\n\nHere is the breakdown of USO prices and how they correspond to crude oil prices until the next rollover begins on May 5th:\n\n*This assumes a premium discount of 2.42% - which is probably a bit generous as the average over the past month has been 1.98%. The difference in that amount is about 2 pennies so I just went with what it closed at today. \u00a0 \n\nCrude / USO\n\n$20 / $3.41\n\n$22 / $3.75\n\n$24 / $4.09\n\n$26 / $4.43\n\n$28 / $4.77\n\n$30 / $5.11\n\n$32 / $5.45\n\n$34 / $5.79\n\n$36 / $6.13\n\n$38 / $6.47\n\n$40 / $6.81\n\n$42 / $7.15\n\n$44 / $7.49\n\n$46 / $7.83\n\n$48 / $8.17\n\n$50 / $8.51\n\nNone of these numbers are accurate beyond May 5th. As oil prices stand today, it looks like USO may lose another 15% to 25% of contracts next month (leading to further decay in USO value) but it's too soon to say for sure. \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nFYI: the math is very basic\n\n(Contracts x 1000) x Oil price = market value.\n\nmarket value / shares = NAV price\n\nNAV price + premium discount = Share price", "created_utc": 1586910594.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1hfyd/uso_prices_april_15_may_5/", "is_self": true}
