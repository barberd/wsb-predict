The RSI is at 29 on daily and is diverging positively. It bounced off 200 day MA twice in two days so we know that $1752 is good support. It has only hit this low of RSI in May and December and rallied $300 plus since. We also got a Doji and hammer candlesticks. \n\nAnalysts had upgraded it with 2300 or so PT. It is all gambling but odds are looking good as long as market doesn't sell off and Bezos stops selling his shares.", "created_utc": 1565127007, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cmwgfa/amzn_calls/", "is_self": true}
