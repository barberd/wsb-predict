It's that genie lamp you bought from a pawn shop in Tijuana, where you go every 3 months and pay strippers to hold your hand in public. \n\nWhen the genie comes out, you play it smart. You've seen enough movies and know the genie will fuck you over if you ask for money, and this one only gives you a single wish. So, instead of money, you ask the genie when the next investing opportunity of a lifetime will come. You know how options work. You can leverage a personal loan and become a millionaire overnight.\n\nThe genie tells you that, by Summer 2020, the US will have 50 million unemployed, the worst GDP contraction in history, and the army will be open-firing into a crowd of peaceful protestors. The genie vanishes into smoke.\n\nYou think to yourself, holy crap, that's dystopia and only 7 months away. You go straight back to Pornhub, but once you finish, you sell all of your belongings and take out a loans to buy 50k worth of SPY 200 Puts expiring August. They were really cheap because SPY was $299.99 then, so you bought 10,000 contracts.\n\nThe day after, you celebrate a bit too hard in Tijuana and the Mexican police arrests you for a year, but you get out after 6 for good behavior. \n\nThe first thing you do when you get out is check the markets. \n\nSPY $306.", "created_utc": 1591055958.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/guw8cc/you_find_out_that_the_genie_lamp_you_bought_at_a/", "is_self": true}
