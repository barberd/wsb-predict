{"id": "blybb7", "title": "My trading career so far, some observations and wisdom", "selftext": "Hello all,\n\nI got into trading a year ago at nineteen. After reading several value investing books I came to the conclusion that value investing is boring, but the stock market is cool. I then binged tastytrade and decided that options were the way to go, it was at this moment that I understood that more leverage is always better. Unfortunately I don't have the funds required to get leverage yet, thought this is changing soon.\n\nI don't really have a style of investing. To be honest I kind of just throw money at things that I find interesting and then sit back and enjoy the roller coaster that it takes me on. No stop losses, remember - you don't lose money until you sell. For example, last week I bought edibles from a Spirit Leaf Store and later bought their parent company stock while peaking. I figure the profit they made off of me while be redistributed back to me and then some through me holding their stock, checkmate, capitalists. \n\nLate last summer I had managed to grow my account from $1200 to $2000 in two months through steadfast reckless, irresponsible and completely impulsive investing. I made most of that money flipping OGI, a weed stock. I then reinvested my entire account into FRII because I had read about them in value investors club. I sold FRII a week ago after telling myself to just wait it out for a year at a net loss of \\~$1200. Reinvested that into a few stocks, my largest holding is SNC Lavalin to show some patriotic pride. \n\nMy smallest position was PRO Real Estate Trust, I had read about it in a MotleyFool article as it has a +%9 div yield and had bought it last summer, only to sell it to buy more FRII.  Bought $150 worth, it's tripled in three days due to the company announcing the fact that it was going to be listed on the TSX.\n\nThe lesson here is to always seek out companies committed to delivering value wherever possible.  PRO Real Estate provides me value through it's ridiculous div yield, and for joining the big boys on bay street. SNC provides me value with the knowledge that this company will go to absurd, illegal lengths to make money. But FRII? I ate there once and left hungry, not enough protein. \n\nTLDR: Wallstreet bets is a great community that has fostered my own personal growth and development. I credit it extensively with my ability to - nah I'm just fucking with you, the post would take maybe 3 minutes of your time to read - what else are you going to do? I'm not going to be the cause of perpetuating ADHD in Western nations, lazy fucks. \n\nCheers,\n\nWalmartman", "created_utc": 1557274058, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/blybb7/my_trading_career_so_far_some_observations_and/", "is_self": true}
