{"id": "entw5p", "title": "TSLA probably mildly down on earnings", "selftext": "Hear me out. \n\n\\- Earnings beat already more than priced in due to delivery data and speculation\n\n\\- Lots of new dumb money coming in due to recent turnaround from CNBC, Cramer, O'Leary, etc.\n\n\\- Q4 is always good and Q1 always shit, so if I'm Kirkhorn, I'd try to defer some Q4 profits into Q1 to even things out. Milder beat for Q4 but much better surprise for Q1 earnings, and seeming to buck the trend of other automakers. This will appear, however, like Tesla's margin was less than expected, which looks like a trend in the wrong direction, even though this is just accounting shenanigans to defer some profits into Q1. \n\n\\- Elon tweeted that feature complete FSD is coming \"soon,\" so this makes them unlikely to recognize any FSD revenue in Q4. \n\n\\- Likely also a lot of new debt incurred in getting GF3 up and running on time, which will make the Q4 balance sheet less attractive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBased on above, I expect TSLA to see a mild sell-off after Q4 earnings, since the beat will be \"less than expected,\" and \"lingering issues about margin sustainability and debt obligations.\" If I had to guess, I would guess a sudden drop to around 450 level at earnings, and then a slow decline to around 430 into Q1 as people won't expect much boost from a Q1 automaker earnings. Maybe a slight pop on delivery numbers if they are impressive, but probably not. Then Q1 earnings will be a big surprise thanks to:\n\n\\- Deferred revenue from Q4\n\n\\- Increased sales as china factory ramps up\n\n\\- Partial recognition of FSD revenue.\n\nExpect immediate rebound back to 475 level, and then slower crawl up past 500 as the FOMO sets in. New support around 500 level. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR: Buy slightly OTM weekly puts going into Q4 earnings. Return to theta gang a week after earnings. Buy slightly OTM calls going into Q1 earnings.
