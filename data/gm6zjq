{"id": "gm6zjq", "title": "HD/LOW will report record-breaking Q1 results. Q2 will likely be above average. Full year--???", "selftext": "So basically Lowe's and Home Depot are highly likely to crush Q1 earnings.  What's more, they'll do it with increased online sales, which is something Wall St loves even in normal times, as it shows resistance to the Amazonification of commerce.\n\nMy only concern is how Lowe's/HD will handle guidance. Will it be another AMZN/CTXS, or will it be an ATVI?  Firstly, I think they will surpass expectations for Q1 results better than AMZN/CTXS.  Secondly, I think an argument can be made strong sales will continue for HD/LOW.\n\n**Q2 Outlook**\n\nSales may drop back to normal in Q2, but Q2 is also normally one of the two annual peaks in sales for HD/Lowe's.  What's more, if people got in to gardening/home improvement this spring, they are likely to continue that hobby throughout the summer, supporting higher-than-normal sales even as lockdowns end.  Further, many states have extended lockdowns, which would be good for the stay-at-home home-improvement play.   \n\n**Pro Customers**\n\nIn particular, I think a recovery in pro customers may be important, as well as a recovery in the housing market.  On those topics, it does seem like searches for home-improvement related occupations have at least recovered after a dip, or are at new highs.  Also, the real estate market isn't as bad as reported- [Redfin: Home-Buying Demand Passes Pre-Coronavirus Levels; Inventory Down 24%](https://www.redfin.com/blog/homebuying-demand-passes-prepandemic-levels/)\n\nAlso, Home Depot/Lowe's are less dependent on new home starts than you might think, because [HD/LOW are not where big development projects get materials from](https://www.reddit.com/r/Construction/comments/14annh/where_do_real_estate_developers_and_home_builders/), they're for smaller contractors and DIYers.  \n\n**Full year outlook**\n\nFinally, the optimism in today's market due to vaccine/JPow may bleed over into the full-year guidance provided by HD/LOW.  Especially since they still have Q2 -summer peak and Q4- holiday season to look forward to.  \nThoughts?\n\n\nTl;dr Q1 for HD LOW will be record-breaking, but what about guidance?\n\nPositions: LOW 6/19 115C HD 6/19 250C \n\n---\n\n*Note that AMZN diminished its profit due to virus-related expenses, but I don't think that is as big an issue for HD/LOW because they are less logistics-heavy compared to Amazon, I don't think they took as extensive steps as Amazon, and finally Bezos loves to not report much profit and spending profits on the business- I think to some extent he is just be using CV as an excuse for doing so this quarter.\n\n\nGoogle Trends: Searches for [Lowe's/HD have nearly or more than doubled their all time highs](https://i.imgur.com/z1jjSuv.png).  Included for comparison are Wayfair and Bed Bath Beyond, the latter of which saw a big increase in its stock price upon revealing it saw a big uptick in online sales, which you can see in the trends search data.  \n\nLowe's seems to have increase proportionally more than HD, and Lowe's also is favored in the South and Midwest, states with early spring and/or low virus impacts and lots of houses with yards.  In addition, Lowe's sales are historically less targeted toward pros and more toward DIY consumers, compared to HD.\n\nAlthough the past quarter has been about DIY, guidance going forward may depend on a return of professional customers.  To that note, many searches for [occupations related to home improvement](https://i.imgur.com/1ilY1e1.png) have shown either recovery to norm from a March low, or in some cases at ATHs.\n\nSearches for products LOW/HD sell are mostly at all-time highs, many doubling previous highs.\n\nFrom Google Trends:\n\n[Construction/backyard materials](https://i.imgur.com/02r60TQ.png)\n\n[Gardening materials](https://i.imgur.com/Ma3w3Ee.png)\n\n[Big ticket backyard items](https://i.imgur.com/99aRd4d.png)\n\n[Tools/Machines](https://i.imgur.com/PDdzWho.png)\n\nSubreddit posts from /r/HomeDepot and /r/Lowes showing just how absolutely insane the past quarter has been; some recent posts report it hasn't really slowed down yet, and some places like Canada are still reopening/moving into spring, can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/18845683/comments/gm6oih/dd_links_for_data_on_hdlow_q1/).
