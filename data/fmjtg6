This place is not clean on a regular Saturday and the people there and questionable at best.\n\n\nToday was unreal. No staff with masks zero glove changes and hundreds of people in store without gloves or masks. It was insane. Some customers had masks and gloves myself include because on a good day I leave feeling gross  from that place. Long and short places like this with lots of uninformed or just careless customers will cause issues. \n\nBless all the retail workers but goddamn that experience put it in perspective. \n\nPositions: cash gang cause I got witchered for 60% loss Friday\n\nEdit: puts on all restaurants and I own one.", "created_utc": 1584816141.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmjtg6/dd_from_restaurant_supply_chain/", "is_self": true}
