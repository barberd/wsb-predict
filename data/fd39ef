Today I had the brilliant idea of getting puts on INTC. But I didn't pull the trigger. Why? Because my confidence is SHOT. At a time like this, hype is all you need. And I didn't have it. I pulled the trigger on one thing today. Nothing big. Just a DEAC call. One call contract. (Just one? Yeah. Pathetic) Supposedly, DEAC is merging with Draft Kings, yippee, they have a conference tonight. Can we hype some good plays for tomorrow? Please, people who have done your DD, or people who are currently making good money, or expect to. Share, and discuss.
