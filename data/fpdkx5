Mostly because I was high and I thought their earnings report was 4/17 but since noticing my error I have found new more autistic ways of justification. \n\n This is the year of 4/20/20.  Not only is it 420 all month but on that special day there is clearly another 20.  THIS EXTRA 20 IS NOT PRICED IN!  Exponential possibilities. The 420 ether in the air will reach intoxicating levels on the big day having unsuspected traders pulled in to that penny stock quicker than my wife's boyfriend comes over after I leave pretending to go to work.\n\nTldr: ACB $1c 4/24 for a smoke ride in the Tesla in Orbit. Or you know a couple free lunches.", "created_utc": 1585237017.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpdkx5/acb_424_blaze_it/", "is_self": true}
