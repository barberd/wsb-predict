Fuck you, read my shit.\n\nThe reason oil prices go negative is because it's apparently more costly to stop and restart oil production than it would be to literally pay people to take the oil off your hands. Of course, this doesn't happen until storage facilities reach maximum capacity. [u/krypticlol](https://www.reddit.com/user/krypticlol/) was pretty early with his prediction of when even federal reserve capacity would reached (they estimated end of March).\n\n>Drillers and pumpers already know this \u2013 so they\u2019ve been chartering oil tankers out for months at a time. You can quote me on this: giant floating tanks of oil, typically used for transporting oil across oceans, will instead be repurposed to act as storage facilities during this oversupply event. This is not the first time these boats were used for this reason, same thing was done in 2015-2016. For those who want to know the mechanics, daily spot rates to reserve one of these VLCCs has risen from an average of $30,000/day to over $250,000/day. Keep in mind, boat expenses will not vary much, crew, food is all fixed \u2013 so nearly every additional dollar at the topline can flow to the bottom. We are talking about a potential for 3-5x in net income for some of these names.\n\nWell that's great u/ozemoed, but where are your news sources supporting this prediction?\n\nNovember 19 2019: [President of Scorpio Tankers buys $450K of call contracts](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3520684-scorpio-tankers-bugbee-buys-2k-call-option-contracts-for-450k)\n\nMarch 11 2020: [Hes back for more, this time $1.9M of call contracts](https://www.tradewindsnews.com/finance/bugbee-back-again-for-more-scorpio-tankers-options/2-1-770883)\n\nFuck you u/ozemoed, me likey draw colors tuhuhuuu crayons hhhhh\n\n[STNG Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/wopr1anqd1u41.png?width=1503&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad3c2343b67460da90874d95e9609ba31ee73607)\n\nSee the ascending triangle (white crayola)?  STNG just popped today with the negative oil prices for the /CLK20, sending it straight through that resistance and towards the 200EMA on the daily chart and the large Time-Price Opportunity node at 26.4. Furthermore, the MACD agrees with the upward momentum and stochastics indicate an upwards swing may only be getting started.\n\nEarnings for STNG are on 4/30/20 before market open. Just in time to pick up some STNG 25c May 15 calls for $3.10 ea.\n\nAnd before you ban me for not having a position.\n\n[STNG Position](https://preview.redd.it/d8epredrg1u41.png?width=1191&format=png&auto=webp&s=00616237437430023d1080b5280b4f385ec59a5f)\n\nGot in today when the mark was $1.45 and made a quick $280. Taking a larger position once I see the trend continue into the large volume node.\n\n**TL;DR STNG 25c May 15**\n\n**Edit\\* 5:33PM** In response to u/Pro28 \"OK man let me know how you plan on getting land-locked WTI to an oil tanker\":\n\n[They already have pipelines out to the coast](https://preview.redd.it/m4zrysgpk1u41.jpg?width=920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ca35cf870736d5ed28a117a94e34a7b063ab67ed)\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1587417370.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g51hde/oil_tankers_are_floating_storage_stng_25c_may_15/", "is_self": true}
