If you are like me you failed to get to the store on time to fight off the boomers for TP. Well you are in luck! Fortunately I racked up some massive student loan debt getting a doctorate, now society thinks I am smart. As I was pinching a loaf this morning I reached into my cabinet to find only one lonely roll left. First I cursed my girlfriends name as she uses half of roll every time she enters the bathroom. But then I had an idea. A permanent fix! A bullet proof idea for all future situations which involve people hoarding TP. Bidets!!! And guess what!!! Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s and menards all got a few in stock. Now I know these bad boys aren\u2019t popular in the good ole USA but in Australia they don\u2019t have this TP problem because everyone has one. And your butt will love that nice warm water cleansing it from those frozen burritos you stocked up on and ate the night before . No more raw ass (for life) and no more TP issues. Well I have said enough!\n\nTLDR: Home Depot calls 4/17.... puts after because housing markets will be toast in the next recession", "created_utc": 1584193258.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fiiimb/no_more_charmin_for_your_delicate_arse_home_depot/", "is_self": true}
