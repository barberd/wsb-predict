{"id": "beaya1", "title": "[Discussion] What type of investors actually beat the market?", "selftext": "If anyone has taken a finance class, one of the first things you learn in Portfolio Theory or Investment Management is that active funds historically underperform the market over the long term.  We see articles all the time that retail investors underperform the market, but at the same time, institutional investors such as hedge funds and actively managed mutual funds have historically underperformed as well.  There are many studies such as [DALBAR](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/americans-are-still-terrible-at-investing-annual-study-once-again-shows-2017-10-19) which continually show that retail investors are god awful (no surprise).  Here is one of numerous studies that illustrate hedge funds underperforming the market by [JP Morgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com/jpmpdf/1320744896869.pdf).  Theoretically speaking, the performance of the market should be the average, but every study confirms that every major group underperforms.\n\nMy question is, what types of investors actually beat the market?  \n\n1. Are there a few top funds or Wizdaddy that perform well above the rest?  Taking gains from all retail and institutional investors and lowering their average returns?\n2. Are fees from brokers causing this performance difference by lowering returns?\n3. Is everyone on WSB overperforming and unaccounted for? /s\n\nWhat are yalls thots?", "created_utc": 1555524184, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/beaya1/discussion_what_type_of_investors_actually_beat/", "is_self": true}
