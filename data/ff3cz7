{"id": "ff3cz7", "title": "Will $TQQQ bust tho", "selftext": "[About 2 weeks ago, on February 24th, /u/dlkdev posted some DD about how $TQQQ is over leveraged and could potentially bust.] (https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f8s1tc/tqqq_is_going_bust/) \n\n$TQQQ has $1.3B of its portfolio in cash for its NDX Swaps, for which its exposure is $12.5B. The rest of its collateral is in the form of stocks. He says that for every % NDX closes down, $TQQQ loses $125M in cash. Ultimately, if NDX loses too much of its value, $TQQQ will have to liquidate it's stock holdings in order to cover its swaps. This would wipe out the fund. \n\nBut would it?\n\nAccording to the fund's [prospectus] (https://www.proshares.com/funds/prospectus.html?ticker=TQQQ), $TQQQ \"seeks daily investment results ... that correspond to 3x the return of the Nasdaq-100 Index ... for a single day, not for any other period.\" In the worst case scenario, $TQQQ wouldn't be able to meet it's investment objectives. Is that enough to bust? I'm not sure if the fund would go from its current price of ~$76.84/share to $0/share. Just because it's unlikely to meet its objectives. After all, it still has plenty of holdings in stock. Wouldn't it more likely just delist? The share price might lose some value, but it certainly wouldn't end up at $0/share, or \"bust\". \n\nThis is all if this scenario happens at all. Looking at the fund's holdings sheet on [March 6] (https://www.proshares.com/funds/tqqq_daily_holdings.html), on [Feb 26] (https://web.archive.org/web/20200227095934/https://www.proshares.com/funds/tqqq_daily_holdings.html), and on Feb 24 (no archive on this date), it doesn't seem like $TQQQ is under duress.\n\nIt's true that cash went from $1.3B on 2/24 to $859M on 2/26 to $473M on 3/6 but it looks like $TQQQ just used the cash to buy shares in NDX's underlyings. For example from 2/26 to 3/6, the number of shares held by $TQQQ for the majority of its stock holdings ($AAPL, $MSFT, $AMZN, etc.) increased. In addition, its swap exposure decreased from $12.5B on 2/24 to $10.5B on 2/26 to $10.2B on 3/6.\n\nHonestly, I'm not sure how to interpret this at all. I'm hoping something with more experience can chime in.", "created_utc": 1583622736, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ff3cz7/will_tqqq_bust_tho/", "is_self": true}
