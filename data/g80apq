Never have I ever seen such jaw dropping loss porn on WSB, but don\u2019t let this stop you fellow autists. Keep burning more cash till we break even and send ourselves to the fucken moon boys. Down 20k all time, was up 27k early March but JPOW bonned us all. I was so confident about my winnings that I gave fianc\u00e9e 3k to spend and I built myself a sick PC with some AMD shit and NVDIA shit. So technically I\u2019m in the hole 25k. Have $500 left in my WeBull, $1k in TOS and 100 shares of LK in RH LOLOLOLOL. Stimulus check aint in yet and neither is my unemployment card. But once those funds come in, you bet your ass I\u2019m going all in on TOS. Don\u2019t let these bitches scare us out of our black lambos. It\u2019s just money in the end.", "created_utc": 1587845100.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g80apq/alright_you_fkn_autists_im_down_20k_and_aint/", "is_self": true}
