{"id": "gwilzm", "title": "SPAQ - new reverse merger play?", "selftext": "Been looking into potential reverse merger companies (SPACs) and came across Spartan Energy Acquisition (SPAQ).  This is a company, similar to VTIQ and DKNG, that exists for the purpose of effecting a merger to bring a private company public at a cost much lower than a traditional IPO.\n\nI want to lead saying SPAQ has NOT announced a potential target as of yet, however, their deadline to effect a merger is August 13, 2020 or else they have to liquidate.  \n\nI think that it is unlikely that this will happen as they are managed by Apollo Global (a legit private equity firm) and has $569M in its trust account at the end of Q1 2020.  Rather, I think it is likely that they will announce a potential target and set a shareholder vote to extend the deadline to effect a merger prior to Aug 13 (how nearly ever other SPAC has done leading up to the merger date).\n\nOnce a target is announced, the stock (SPAQ) and the warrants (SPAQWS) will pop, and again following the shareholder vote.  Doesn't really matter who the target is, since the warrants are trading at .60 right now (well under the $1.5 listing price when the SPAQ was set up).\n\nThen again - the risk in all of this is that no merger is announced and the SPAC liquidates on August 13, leaving the warrants worthless.  So keep that in mind before you drain your life savings into this one.\n\nTLDR: Buy SPAQWS - some risk, big reward.", "created_utc": 1591281306.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gwilzm/spaq_new_reverse_merger_play/", "is_self": true}
