I know that when the market opens tomorrow, the new % gains or losses will not be based on the ETN's initial value, but rather the % change tomorrow. So what I was wondering was if oil opens 3% down tomorrow, will I then have a 30% gain? Or will the gains/losses be based upon the % change after the initial opening price? \n\nI have tried googling everything, but couldn't seem to find an answer...\n\nThanks in advance!", "created_utc": 1580153549, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/euszti/what_happens_to_an_etn_when_the_market_is_closed/", "is_self": true}
