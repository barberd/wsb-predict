{"id": "fcz686", "title": "QGEN TENDIES & Donation", "selftext": "[Qiagen was acquired today by Thermo Fisher](https://www.barrons.com/articles/thermo-fisher-buying-qiagen-covid-19-sart-virus-molecular-testing-diagnostics-51583247510) after rejecting a previous acquisition offer as the cornovirus outbreak just started in Wuhan. Their stock traded sideways relative to most of the other biotechs. During the past few days I flipped 34 calls for gains.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo celebrate my gains, I've made a $21 donation to a [teacher](https://www.donorschoose.org/classroom/ms-darmody). Many underpaid teachers spend hundreds of their own tendies per year on school supplies for their students.\n\nEdit: Increased my donation to $100 because I'm getting shamed. I'm up 1400 after suffering some losses earlier in the year. I don't know the donation etiquette for this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rci9wyk78ik41.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4080e03b5230cb3985b9fbef5c132211e9b3c72\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uav69kyo3ik41.png?width=412&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc5ea7ff8ff94565388b815df2a43891f1323407\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zz5k09ns3ik41.png?width=1476&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a08a478b88926bb0904b36e1c83a4e990874e5c\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/74mypuw5pjk41.png?width=420&format=png&auto=webp&s=50b3949d44074c41c21605320179451ca567fd32", "created_utc": 1583260841.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fcz686/qgen_tendies_donation/", "is_self": true}
