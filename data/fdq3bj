From the start the Chinese numbers have been dodgy, and I turned extra gay when I heard the Chinese do nothing save face government went full quarantine a few weeks back.\n\nIt made me resurrect my robin-hood account and go all in on puts about a week back.\n\nI honestly think there is a significant possibility that the actual mortality rate is being hilariously underreported due to chinese numbers being absolute bullshit.\n\nI've been waiting to see what western countries will report in regards to mortality rate, and its not looking good in Italy currently.\n\nItalian cases recovered vs dead = 45/21 --&gt; [source](https://www.thelocal.it/20200228/italys-coronavirus-death-toll-rises-to-21-as-821-cases-confirmed)\n\nWe are possibly looking at a virus that is essentially as deadly as 2003 SARS while being much more infectious.
