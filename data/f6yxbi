{"id": "f6yxbi", "title": "MSFT mooning YOLOs.", "selftext": "You dumb retards that know nothing about Government procurement and YOLO'd all your tendies on MSFT calls are true autists of WSB.\n\nDisclaimers: My day job is as a Government Procurement Officer with the power and unlimited authority to contractually bind the Government so I can give you quality insights.\n\n1) This recent ruling basically not only prevent MSFT from starting work, it's telling the awarding agency to recheck/re-evalute their award decision for potential bias (crossing their Ts and dotting their Is) because shit is about to get real.\n\n2) When it gets to this stage, the Agency's Legal Advisors always recommend addressing the allegations, tweaking the requirement, and requesting for re-proposals from the parties still in the competitive range (AMZN and MSFT).  Pretty much back to square 1.\n\n3) Legal Advisors' recommendations are always adhere under these conditions since Government employees do not have and/or cannot afford personal attorneys should they chose to disregard the recommendations. These Government employees care about their paychecks, your calls and puts are irrelevant to their day to day work.\n\n4) Political allegations will cause further delay in the overall decision.  Political and professional career advancements make this decision a tough sell this fiscal and calendar year.  You can keep kicking this down the road without risking/losing your job as a Government employee.\n\n5) The Government argument submitted as to why the award should remains as evaluated, the delay cost, and risks to the Government are all standard language.\n\n6) Even if MSFT eventually won the re-evaluation, the bump in the stock price is not even going to be more than 5% and insignificant in my opinion.  This Contract is big and only received alot of recognition and attention from the media because of the political allegations, but in the grand scheme of things it's just another huge Contract for the DoD which may give someone a slight edge on their resume when it comes to interviews and promotions as a talking point. \n\n...With that being said, the risk to reward is too low for you retards to keep pumping MSFT on this single issue.  Your guarantee bet is to buy the stonks if you wholly love MSFT or sell call/put options and keep collecting the premium from all the WSB retards.  MSFT ain't going to moon this year nor the next based on this single issue.", "created_utc": 1582229586, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6yxbi/msft_mooning_yolos/", "is_self": true}
