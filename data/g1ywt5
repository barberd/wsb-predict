It's a real bold strategy to announce that you have national news, and that you're gonna put it out 24 hours later. To my autist ears this sounds like news that won't get cucked, and has real relevancy (isn't some UFC shit) to the NFL world. What kind of news could that be?    \n    \nI don't fucking know and neither do you (and the other half of you don't give a fuck), but theres a CHANCE this could be news regarding a streaming service for football provided by Fox. It's the only news that presumably wouldn't leak beforehand, and would be national news as the NFL prepares to play at least part of a season without fans, and seeks to monetize the viewing experience for those fans out of their local market. It's a stretch but what isn't here...    \n    \nOr in a far more likely scenario, it's literally news about ANYTHING else and we light our money on fire together.    \n        \nFOXA 4/17 calls or GTFO", "created_utc": 1586978980.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1ywt5/maybe_maybe_not_maybe_fox_yourself_how_a/", "is_self": true}
