{"id": "hg8uul", "title": "Foolproof DD for Guaranteed Gains", "selftext": " \n\nBeen reading and trying option strategies on this sub for sometime and nothing seems to work. My account has been a sea of red and I'm at the verge of losing my all investments, house and family.\n\nWhen it comes to options, absolutely nothing works. Market goes up? Puts lose. Market goes down? Calls lose. And you magically happen to be holding exactly the options that lose money in that market scenario. As soon as you sell and reverse positions, the market gives you a big middle finger and reverses trend. It all seems like the whole market was invented to personally rob you of all you've cared for in your life - money.\n\nWell, if this sounds like you too, I've got an absolutely foolproof way of making a boatload amount of money. Hunker down because this is going to get very complex and technical. Although I will try to keep this as simple as possible so it can be understood by 11 year olds - the average age of a Robinhood user.\n\nFirst thing first, this has nothing to do with options. I'm tired of losing money on calls and puts. Yeah, you make +1,000% once in a blue moon, but this strategy is going to make us even more tendies.\n\nStep 1: Finding the right stock for this. For this strategy to work, we need to find a stock that has a really low market cap. Don't worry about this step as I've done you guys a favor and after hours of research and a quick google search, found one. $NLST The stock trades about $0.44 as I write this and has a market cap of \\~80 million.\n\nStep 2: We have 1.3m degenerates on this sub. This strategy will have to be a collective effort of everyone on this sub. A bunch of you are pussies and are not going to buy in, and for the sake of calculation, I'm going to consider only 1,000,000 of you. All of us need to buy the stock of $NLST. But just so that we're fair to our brethren and people of room temperature IQ (Celsius), we're all going to limit ourselves to a buy of $80. If a million of us contribute $80, we can buy the whole company with $80 million.\n\nStep 3: ???\n\nStep 4: PROFIT!!!\n\nI understand some of you are confused right now but I had to do it for the sake of memes. Let me explain step 3 again.\n\nSo, you might've seen this strategy in play before. It's called taking a company private. Rookie move if you ask me. We're going to take this one step further, or backwards in this case. We're going to own all of the stock and NOT take the company private.\n\nNow comes the most interesting part. Since we own 100% of the stock, we'll be the ones deciding the sell price. Now, if you're shortsighted like Elon Musk or Warren Buffet, you could sell it for double or triple the initial investment but we're diamond hands baby. We're going to aim much higher than that. If we just refuse to sell our share at any price, FOMO and greed are going to kick-in and going to make people want it even more. But we must absolutely refuse to sell.\n\nYou would ask, how would someone get rich from this then? Well, let me explain this through a chart.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ghi5xno5o9751.jpg?width=525&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=18cafa78e6454573c7bfda9644643ebd04648740\n\nAt what price level do we stop? $100? $200? $300? NO! Infinity baby!\n\nIf we own all the stock of this company, we can pretty much set the price we wish to sell. And if we set that price as infinity, we'll be infinitely rich!!!\n\nNow it's obvious that your pea sized brain is unable to handle all this information at once and you're wondering who would buy the stock if we price it at infinity. Even Jeff Bezos taps out $160bn.\n\nHere's where it gets even more interesting. We've got to take some inspiration from Jeff Bezos. Is he worth $160bn because he sold off his stock? NO! Someone there to pay $160bn to take his stock off him? NO! But he's still worth $160bn.\n\nWe're going to do the exact same thing but at an even higher scale. Instead of setting a lowly target of $160bn, we're going to set the stock price at infinity! Anyone holding stock of the company would instantly become a infinitenaire. We're going to have so much wealth that we can purchase anything on this planet, heck even the planet itself.\n\nYou can leave your job, retire at 12, say fuck you to everyone around you and start finding the island you're going to live the rest of your life in. I've already quit my job and purchased my share of the stock. Can't wait to kick this plan in motion and become infinitely rich!", "created_utc": 1593182597.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hg8uul/foolproof_dd_for_guaranteed_gains/", "is_self": true}
