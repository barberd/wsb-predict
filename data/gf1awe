{"id": "gf1awe", "title": "Buy the tanker dip faggot", "selftext": "You woke up today as I did and saw stng jumped 6% at open. Maybe you were like me and didn\u2019t see the tanker DD till too late and didn\u2019t want to pay for the 200% IV calls before earnings. You feel the FOMO and can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t jump on the easiest profit train of your life. Earnings 60% higher than expected, when that was purely driven in ~2 weeks of higher rates to end the quarter. The guidance comes out that these debt ridden companies are being responsible with paying it off, and are expecting to make a killing in Q2. Then the tanking starts. Down 10% after a big earnings beat and some of the best short term guidance you\u2019ll ever hear from a company. How could this happen? \n\n~85% of tanker stocks are held by the institutions. People underestimate the retard strength that WSB buying power actually has. Algos were selling those high IV options to all you retard faggots that have never looked at a Greek that wasn\u2019t a ripped statue resembling your wife\u2019s boyfriend. The market is built to cause you max pain and take your money. They sold you the contracts at a high premium, bought them back from you at a 1/4 of the price, and will profit off them themselves while you join $ROPE gang watching them make the sweet 5x tendies that you should have made. \n\nDon\u2019t fall for it. If you were already in, tough it out a bit longer. If you weren\u2019t already in, buy the dip. I personally bought stng 25c for July right before close today. Don\u2019t be surprised if tankers make a push in the next week and the 5/15 calls you gave up on end up in the money after all. If that doesn\u2019t happen, wait till the oil chess game continues with the next wave of contracts. STNG is down over 50% from the beginning of the year after a successful quarter with quite possibly the best quarter it will ever have on the horizon. Don\u2019t be retarded and overthink this and let the algos talk you out of what will end up being the easiest tendies of your life very soon.", "created_utc": 1588832911.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gf1awe/buy_the_tanker_dip_faggot/", "is_self": true}
