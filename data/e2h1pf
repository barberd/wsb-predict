Oh holiday dinners with your broke ass company that doesn't cover the bill? I'm stuck with paying 300 dollars for your vodka waters. Wake up, pay 30 bucks to go work off all those carbs at some dumb spin class with PTON. Then you really think we're going to go back to her house without passing SBUX and getting her peppermint mocha? Think again dumbass. We finally get back to her house and I have to hear about how all her LULU is old and she looked like she was wearing a trash bag compared to the other BECKYS in her spin class and she needs to go buy new ones. And all the while we're taking daily trips to fucking ULTA so she can keep looking good for her family she wants to make jealous and impress my retard co-workers. \n\nTL;DR\n\nLong; $BECKY\nShort: my bank account", "created_utc": 1574866311, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e2h1pf/becky_season_is_upon_us/", "is_self": true}
