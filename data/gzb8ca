Beyond Meat's #1 competitor coming to the market SOON DD", "selftext": "Alright boys time to let the people that don't already know in on another beautiful SPAC play that has ridiculous potential. FMCI, or Forum Merger II Corp announced on May 13, 2020 that they have\u00a0[signed a letter of intent](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1741231/000121390020012047/ea121786-defa14a_forummergii.htm)\u00a0with \u201c*a high-growth, plant-based food company with a broad portfolio of innovative products that are aligned with major food trends and sold through leading retailers and distributors across the United States.*\u201d  They also stated that the Target\u2019s disruptive strategy is focused on addressing the growing consumer demand for nutritious, great tasting, better-for-you products with plant-based food. The Target\u2019s alignment with today\u2019s secular food trends, combined with its robust, plant-based offerings that feature unique ingredients, innovative recipes and creative branding, has allowed it to establish a meaningful market presence in a short period of time. Best case scenario is a merger with Impossible Foods. Impossible also just recently had a job listing for a \"Stock admin\" which is something a publicly traded company would be looking for. They are looking for a company valued between $500 million-2b. Impossible is a bit outside of that range but it's still a possibility. (Valued around $2.5b)\n\nFMCI had a stockholder meeting today to vote to extend the SPAC that expires on June 10th to the end of September. They also stated at their meeting that they will be officially signing with and announcing the company they intend to merge within the next couple of weeks. In connection with the extension, none of the Company\u2019s public shares were redeemed by stockholders. (very bullish imo)\n\nOther possible companies include Just, Inc, Before the Butcher, Follow Your Heart, Turtle Island, etc. \n\nCurrently, Beyond Meat $BYND is the one and only stock in the plant-based meat market that is publicly traded with a current market cap of 8.4 Billion, but this has been as high as 15 Billion back in July less than 3 months after their IPO. Even if it's not Impossible, I think giving Beyond a competitor on the market will help both companies. You guys remember what happened not long after Beyond IPO'd, and it's still doing great to this day. \n\nAlso: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-05/half-of-americans-want-meat-free-options-after-industry-s-crisis](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-05/half-of-americans-want-meat-free-options-after-industry-s-crisis) Don't forget the U.S. is also dealing with a HUGE meat shortage at the moment. \n\nPOSITIONS: no options on this yet (wack as fuck) \n\n500 shares of FMCI at an average of 11.82\n\n2,000 FMCIW at an average of 1.18\n\nDo what you want with this information. Good luck gentlemen.", "created_utc": 1591659769.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gzb8ca/fmci_and_fmciw_the_next_vtiqnkla_beyond_meats_1/", "is_self": true}
