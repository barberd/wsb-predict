We need some ideas, but not shitty ones. \n\nHere are some of my ideas: \n\nI like short and long sleeve shirts with pockets, bc pockets are great for drugs\n\nI love the wallstreetbets kid, but I can\u2019t find the source image. I want the [wsbkid](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https://ih0.redbubble.net/image.379601684.6062/raf,360x360,075,t,fafafa:ca443f4786.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=https://www.redbubble.com/people/officialwsb/works/26666062-official-wallstreetbets-the-kid-merchandise?p%3Dcontrast-tank&amp;tbnid=n5KK7jgk_nrSIM&amp;vet=1&amp;docid=GsjXrEcagzcISM&amp;w=360&amp;h=360&amp;hl=en-us&amp;source=sh/x/im) popping out of the pocket [kinda like this](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/277464027020938352/) \n\nI don\u2019t have access to photoshop anymore, and I will not spend money on it bc I have no need to, so if someone has it I\u2019d be more than happy to talk you through the designs while you do all the work, or we can outsource to some other nerds who\u2019d do it for us\n\n[Here\u2019s what I spent the last hour making](https://imgur.com/a/aYdqhwR) on some shitty online photo editor, it\u2019s nowhere near what I\u2019d want the finished product to be but it\u2019s just so you guys get the idea.\n\n[This style](https://www.amazon.com/WRSHP-Modern-worship-Tee-Ambassadors/dp/B079Z43P6T) would be nice as well, but with WLSTBTS or something idk\n\nSo spit your ideas, and pls remember we are all adults and not in fucking middle school.
