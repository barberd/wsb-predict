{"id": "d007gm", "title": "Crazy to Short $AAPL", "selftext": "Since everyone here agrees, opposite must be true.\n\n$AAPL relies on repeat sales of over-priced hardware to people that either:\n(1) already own an iPhone and have no compelling need to upgrade.\n(2) don\u2019t already own an iPhone and are perfectly content with cheaper products of arguably better/equal quality offered by Samsung/Google/etc, OR, are perfectly content paying small small fraction of price for Huawei/crapPhone/etc.\n\n$AAPL faces tremendous risk from trade war with China that isn\u2019t going anywhere favorable prior to 2020 election.\n\n$AAPL stock has been pumped and maintained from buybacks not revenue growth. Their latest positive earnings was an anomaly due to unexpectedly high sales from wearable hardware that are one-time purchase.\n\n$AAPL core OS riddled with major security and privacy vulnerabilities caused by years of short-sighted feature-development. An unprecedented number of exploits have been quietly revealed for their core products each week this year and trend continues to increase/worsen.\n\n$AAPL is at risk for significant anti competitive / antitrust regulatory action over their tight control of their App Store\u2014 already lost in Supreme Court ruling 5-4 permitting legal action against Apple. This could not only decrease the margin on their \u2018services\u2019 revenue stream, but may also introduce massive competition (not only from Spotify etc) but via 3rd apps siphoning core icloud services by the cloud giants (already permitted Chrome on their protected iOS webkit)\n\n$AAPL \u2018s recent methods attempting to force users to purchase newer iPhones/computers (e.g. preventing 3rd party battery replacements or repairs, pushing out software updates to program performance degradation of older iPhone models, preventing older MacBooks from upgrading to latest OS, soldering computer parts to MB to prevent ability to upgrade, etc.) has upset many loyal customers. Most of their purported logic behind these methods are flimsy at best and unethical or nonsensical at worst. (E.G. Why should a base model dual-core 1.8GHz i5 4GB RAM mid-2012 MacBook Air be able to upgrade to latest MacOS \u2014 but NOT a quad-core 2.4GHz i7 16GB RAM late 2011 MacBook Pro ?!?)  \n\n$AAPL outlook signals poor. By diverting focus from their core business model offering *premium consumer electronics* instead venturing into forays such as software services, credit cards, audio/video content streaming, etc. reveals a lack of innovation, and signals that their market saturation has peaked. This senescence of growth of ether market saturation or market differentiation is supported by the appeared scrambling to grasp-at-any-straw that APPL can leverage their peaking market saturation behind\u2014 if growth was planned, or expected, many of these plays would be better executed later; if you are the worlds best consumer electronics company and your flagship product\u2019s sales are slowing down, shouldn\u2019t you focus on creating/offering the world the next great consumer electronics product? Why TF create credit card or start creating and streaming tv shows?! \nApple Pay never took off. Netflix/Disney/Amazon/Google/Spotify will win streaming. Anybody who spends 10 minutes googling credit card rewards offers for 10 prior to applying will see the Apple Card offers far less that quite literally every other card.\n\n$APPL was an innovative company made successful by the vision and attention to product quality of Steve Jobs.\n\n$APPL cannot suddenly drop, makes up too much of the market and included in too many ETFs. Expect to see a slow rotation out of APPL over next 12-18 months, initiated by next negative earnings and outlook.", "created_utc": 1567686829, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d007gm/crazy_to_short_aapl/", "is_self": true}
