{"id": "bp26hj", "title": "Speculation: MSFT could see considerable growth this summer?", "selftext": "This is by no means any kind of DD or real analysis. I am long MSFT and as a professional software engineer, I love the direction Nadella has taken this company in.\n\nJune 9th Microsoft will host a press conference at E3. Widely expected to unveil their new console, games, and partnerships, they are also likely to put on display their xCloud streaming (perhaps new hardware device as well) service. This will likely compete with Google's Stadia and nVidia's GeForce Now.\n\nI'm not a big gamer but I own an nVidia Shield and love the game streaming aspect. With Microsoft owning the second largest cloud infrastructure I have huge optimism in their ability to execute on this vision.\n\nAdditionally, their relationship with Nintendo continues to become more inclusive. Rumors that you may be able to share one game ecosystem between both companies and devices including mobile, desktop, console, TV.\n\nAnother speculative play is Microsoft's ability to land the US Military's 10 billion JEDI contract. It seems as though this announcement may not come until July at the earliest, however, MSFT already has partnerships with DOD with Hololens.\n\nI bought some June/July calls when we hit these recent lows. MSFT has a relatively low IV compared to historical volatility. I'm thinking there's still room to grow here; anyone else?", "created_utc": 1557947900, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bp26hj/speculation_msft_could_see_considerable_growth/", "is_self": true}
