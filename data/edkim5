{"id": "edkim5", "title": "Convertible bond/preferred stock hedging", "selftext": "Alright fellas I'm drunk again. I read my first book (one that wasn't a pop up) about a dude named edward thorpe who cucked the market and casinos for years. He mentioned how he would leverage a convertible bond/preferred stock in a long and short position and make money off the interest on the bond/preferred typically with a high yield and take a market neutral position. NOW HERES MY AUTISTIC THEORY if I act all smart like or even open up an LLC (any idiot can do it it takes a couple hours and a couple bucks from a lawyer) and say I run a hedge fund and convince a broker to provide me with 10X leverage explain to him what I'm doing so he doesn't skull fuck my whole strategy up with a margin call if the market dramatically moves. Would this be feasible to pull off? Do any of you autists work for a hedgefund and know if this would work?", "created_utc": 1576898428, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/edkim5/convertible_bondpreferred_stock_hedging/", "is_self": true}
