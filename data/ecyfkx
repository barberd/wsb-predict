Tired of RH closing out your spreads before the end of day and wondering \"what if?\" Want to watch your spreads get assigned and dont need the RH nanny to tell you no?\n\n\\-\n\nI am in need of some autists to beta test a feature on RH for me! \n\n\\-\n\nSo back in August, I figured out how to defeat the RH risk management team when they tried to close out my spreads. \n\n\\-\n\nI [reported](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dzrslt/ive_finally_figured_out_how_to_make_money_on/) it finally a month ago for some easy tendies and they apparently didnt fix it even when they knew about it 3 months ago.\n\n\\-\n\nI need testers to see if they have fixed it yet. Why? Just curious/ chaos. Why not me? banned from options.\n\n\\-\n\nall you need to do is have a spread thats at risk. spam F5 starting at 3pm (2:59pm to be safe) on the history page and wait for their close order to pop up. quickly cancel it. rinse and repeat every 5 minutes until market close. who knows, maybe you'll catch a lucky break from PPT and make money on your now expired spread instead of having RH close it for a loss!", "created_utc": 1576785356, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ecyfkx/robinhood_beta_testers_needed/", "is_self": true}
