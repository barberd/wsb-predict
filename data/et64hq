If you try to be \"responsible\" and wait to throw money at SPCE once space tourism is fully operational, you're simply going to end up paying 10x more money for the chance of significantly lower returns. \n\nOnce Branson steps off the first flight successfully this year, do you morons really think the stock is going to wait for you to to step on board? **Of course not!** It's going to blast off along with Virgin Galactics ships and you'll be in full FOMO, desperately scrambling money together to pick up shares/calls at double, if not triple the the price you can now. The strategy is to position yourself early. Because by the time it's a proven success, itll already be too late. \n\nDon't let a minor occasional dip bend you out of shape, because it's likely to pay off very well down the line... \ud83d\ude80\n\n*Not financial advice, don't sue me*", "created_utc": 1579844910, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/et64hq/youre_going_to_be_kicking_yourself_for_not/", "is_self": true}
