Here are my predictions:\n\n* MRR for the next several quarters will be flat and may even decline\n   * Was $55mm as 1Q/20 compared to $54mm at the end of Q4/19\n   * Company already guided to headwinds from free trials but they expect this to pick back up again in 3Q once the trial period ends\n      * [How many of these stores will make it past the 90 day trial?](https://community.shopify.com/c/Feedback-On-My-Store/bd-p/ecommerce-gallery)\n   * I expect users to continue to downgrade in an effort to conserve cash or outright cancel\n* GMV will not stay at these elevated levels\n   * A majority of the categories mentioned on the call are one-time in nature (e.g. home, fitness, entertainment, leisure and hobby products)\n   * Food, beverage and tobacco product category most likely experienced a massive ramp in the first several weeks of April as buyers \"hoarded\" supplies\n   * Consumer discretionary spending will become more challenging over the coming months as the reality of this \"V\" shape recovery sets in\n* As expected, they just [issued a secondary](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001594805/20faef37-cde2-4aec-8b7d-8cbf2bf73c0d.pdf)\n   * Should marginally put pressure on the share price near-term\n* Ownership breakdown is really odd for a $85bn market cap company\n   * 65% owned by institutions, 10% by insiders and 25% by the public/retail\n      * CEO and a Director account for nearly all of the insider holdings\n      * COO owns a *total* of 78 shares, Chief Product Officer owns a *total* of 47 shares, CTO will own *zero* shares once his Intent to Sale goes through on June-1, Chief Legal Officer owns a *total* of 1 share, etc.\n   * I think the retail category can be sum up by yesterday's [Buy the Dip](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gerkgx/they_said_buy_the_dip/) post\n      * Sort by new and look at all the users absolutely having no idea what they're looking at but wanting in\n\nThese guys have never missed on earnings. Again, I believe even a quarter of flat/to declining growth will change the perception driving the stock down. Once that happens it's a race to the bottom.\n\n# TL;DR\n\nI still think the fundamentals of the [original thesis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6pehn/shopify_a_poor_mans_amazon/) hold true. Volatile stock that has little upside given recent massive run-up but major downside risk if they miss revenue growth.\n\n**Position: Jan 15 2021 300 P**\n\nOf note, the OI on this position has increased from \\~800 at the time of the original post to nearly 3k.\n\n*Disclaimer: On the prior post someone said logic does not apply to meme stocks and that ultimately may be the case here. Worst case scenario you lose a few Ks. Best case scenario you end up on the front page of WSB.*", "created_utc": 1588902106.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gfjxgb/shopify_1q_earnings_recap_and_next_steps/", "is_self": true}
