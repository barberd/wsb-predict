{"id": "fczwv8", "title": "Lock in profits without a day trade", "selftext": "If you want to lock in profits (or as close to locking in as possible) convert your calls/puts to a spread. Find your option on the list, then sell the same number of options either above or below the ones you own. Example:\n\nI buy one call of TSLA 720 3/6. It goes up 10% and I want to lock that in but can't sell it because of PDT. So, I sell a TSLA 715 3/6 or a TSLA 725 3/6. Now no matter which way it goes, my risk is reduced.\n\nIf you sell a higher value option, you're reducing risk and betting the stock will reverse. If you sell a lower value option, you're reducing your risk and betting the stock will continue it's current trend.\n\nIt's not as safe as selling, obviously, but it's better than holding with no recourse if you want to exit or reduce your position. I'm not a professional, these are just my opinions and if you lose money that's not on me.\n\n\nedit: If you want to close it the next day, don't close them individually. Close them jointly as a spread where you buy what you sold and sell what you bought.", "created_utc": 1583263603.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fczwv8/lock_in_profits_without_a_day_trade/", "is_self": true}
