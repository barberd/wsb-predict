Broker?\n\n- Tastyworks. Free permissions to do naked options as long as you have initial margin requirements.\n\n2. Margin requirements to sell naked options?\n\n- I think it depends on broker, underlying stock, strike, date, IV, and other stuff. July 19 $195/275 short strangle for $10.53 credit is showing $2.2k buying power reduction for me. Meanwhile a short straddle at $230 for $36.38 credit is showing $4.6k BPR. \n\n3. Your current/next moves?\n\n- Currently selling some uncovered AMZN options. https://i.imgur.com/PztIVlz.png. Not the best margin reduction to profit ratio, but it's a fun play. Will start selling TSLA in the future when next earnings comes up. For the time being, I consider selling puts under $220 as \"safe\" and calls over $255 as \"safe.\" Anything can change. Play accordingly and don't trade more than you're comfortable with.", "created_utc": 1558056033, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bpkxbo/tsla_naked_options_are_free_money_update_1733359/", "is_self": true}
