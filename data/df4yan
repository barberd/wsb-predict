So tried shorting the bounce on ES and CL. Got greedy because i thought we were going to get another leg down. Fast forward to like 30 mins ago with Powell saying he\u2019s bringing back QE so closed for a loss and flipped long cause QE. And then he\u2019s like \u201chaha JK not QE\u201d. In the same 15 mins we slap visa restrictions on chinese officials. In that 15 min candle we had a 21 point swing or .73%. \n\nOver 1k loss between yesterday and today. Anyone else? \n\nNote to self: Don\u2019t short the bottom and stop fucking overtrading.", "created_utc": 1570563285, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/df4yan/anyone_else_getting_their_fucking_face_ripped_off/", "is_self": true}
