{"id": "faopna", "title": "PDT Question - Robinhood", "selftext": "Ok so today I got restricted from trading as I made like 6 day trades today. It says I\u2019m restricted from trading for 90 days. I have 3k in my account in buying power. If I put in another 22k to reach the 25k will my restriction be lifted or will I still have to wait the 90 days? This is also the second PDT restriction I have had. \n\nLeave an answer and bet you would like me to make and I will post it. This being said I will only do this for what I think is the best answer and if it proves right as I already deposited the 22k (recurved my instant 1k , waiting on the rest to hit robin-hood from my bank)", "created_utc": 1582862182, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/faopna/pdt_question_robinhood/", "is_self": true}
