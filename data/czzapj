Leaving reopening and landing 2 hours into trafing. Fucking spirit airlines cause it's a 24 hour trip and I can pack everything in a backpack. I'm concerned I may be poor when I land.\n\nPuts:\n\n HSBC - aw shit... things looking good in Hong kong.\n\nBOX - I dont know... maybe I was drunk a few days ago? Holding for the pullback after yesterday's moon\n\nGTES - it was a falling knife, but someone picked it up and tossed it I guess. Looks like I'm getting cut.\n\nCalls\n\nKGC - one of you assholes told me gold was a good buy. Market looks green, which means red for Gold. I must be colorblind.\n\n\nRDUS - supposed to go up? Went down? Fucking stonks man.\n\nPOR - holding positions for October and Jan. This is my only shining star. All of you will hate me when I'm rich off of an Enron-cast-off-utilities-bullshit. But as I've said before, this one only goes up. Great business plan that.\n\n\n\nSo... I'm definitely going to get killed today\n... except for one thing...\n\nAVOCADOOOOOOOOOOOOIIS!!!\n\nCVGW earnings call keeping me green as guacamole today. All you assholes enjoy your avo-toast while I make the avo-most. \n\nSee you when in a few hours to gloat. I've never tried tendies dipped in guac before.", "created_utc": 1567681434, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/czzapj/stuck_at_the_airport_pre_opening/", "is_self": true}
