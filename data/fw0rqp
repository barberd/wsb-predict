Today they announced that their revenue has DOUBLED since covid hence tbe huge 38% run up today. Volume is higher than usual but if shorts were running to cover i would expext to see a 1.5-3x volume. So covering hasnt started. \n\ni think theres a good chance that you see another big rally tomorrow. \n\nI bought $70C $W 4/9. Why? because ive taken my account from $6k to $20k to $1k being a gay bear. \n\nif i had more $$ I would go mid may/june calls. their earnigs are early may, but im poor so fd\u2019s for me.\n\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1245730268830408705?s=21\n\nEdit1: little drunk and had 4/10 instead of the correct 4/9", "created_utc": 1586187105.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fw0rqp/wayfair_w_short_squeeze/", "is_self": true}
