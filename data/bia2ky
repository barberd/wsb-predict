I told her about AMD stock and how much i had spend on it, because I know it would skyrocket on earnings 30.4.29 after the market close. Like Neil Armstrong to the moon thing.\n\nI told her I was divorce my wife and our 4 kids because they where liabilities. Sold my pets too. \nShe looked stifft into my eyes and after some seconds she told me that she could\nlend me some dough. I was hesitant to use her money because she worked hard for those money. She married young to some rich old dude. So what will i do with gramnas dough? I will immediately wire to my broker. And Buy AMD ASAP monday.\n\nAfter i made alot dough from grandmas i would buy her some nice wine and alot of her favorite cookies.", "created_utc": 1556448906, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bia2ky/grandmas_dough_spend_on_amd/", "is_self": true}
