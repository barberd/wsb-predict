It's 1 of 4 companies, last I checked,  granted emergency use authorization (EUA) by the FDA for their test. The other 3 weren't publicly traded.  They're based in New York. They've been piling up buy ratings.  \n\n\nI bought a few shares to watch it & have been buying calls on every dip. The dips have been small. My shares I bought a while back are over 100%. Earnings appear to be coming out next week on 4/29.  \n\n\nI like test companies over vaccine companies since it seems we'll have more tests done than vaccines done.  \n\n\nOf course do your own research... I'm gladly willing to listen to people suggest anything I've overlooked.  \n\n\nCurrently own some May calls at $15 & June at $20 bought on last dip and some shares.  \n\n\nSources:  \n [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/chembios-covid-19-test-could-separate-it-from-the-rest-of-the-pack-analyst-says-buy-2020](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/chembios-covid-19-test-could-separate-it-from-the-rest-of-the-pack-analyst-says-buy-2020)   \n [https://www.modernreaders.com/news/2020/04/21/chembio-diagnostics-nasdaqcemi-rating-increased-to-buy-at-zacks-investment-research.html](https://www.modernreaders.com/news/2020/04/21/chembio-diagnostics-nasdaqcemi-rating-increased-to-buy-at-zacks-investment-research.html)", "created_utc": 1587659880.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6pycb/cemi_betting_on_tests_over_cures/", "is_self": true}
