{"id": "hgcviz", "title": "US r fuk", "selftext": "Yes, the US has the best printers in the world. BUT \"J\"-shaped recovery is priced in. What will happen when the bounce-back doesn't materialize? Peeps are going to unbuy stocks faster than J-Print can snatch them up. While Europeans are sitting on WIRECARD gains and thinking \"Rona, c'est quoi?\", Muricans are showing the world who's number one... in coronavirus cases. I identify as a perma bull, but there's literal proof that the \"US r fuk\":\n\n**Proof that $SPY hits 150 EOY:**\n\nCase distinction:\n\n1. Second Lockdown: Wall Street realizes that they're sitting on overpriced junk that won't recover any time soon. They are currently disinclined to sell, because they have so many $$$ that they don't know where to put that shit. Under the mattress seems risky because they might not be worth the paper they're printed on if J-Print introduces the USD 1,000,000 bank note (digitally, of course). But if Wall Street feels shit is hitting the fan BIGLY, it takes just a little blood in the water and the bulls turn into \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b. => $SPY 150 EOY\n2. No Second Lockdown: Boomer Remover wreaks havoc. No hospital beds empty. Car crash? \"Nothing we can do for you.\" C-section? \"Can't you just keep the baby inside for a bit longer?\" Imagine that! America will become worse than a third world nation from a healthcare perspective!\\* Reverse Travel Bans will be the norm. Businesses will adjust their outlook and fire even more people. The economic reality for most of America will be poverty & living off shoddy welfare. Millions dead. Many more millions impoverished. From this point, there will be two options:\n   1. Heard immunity hits. US can return to normal But conservatively herd immunity will hit mid-2021. Until then: Choas. => $SPY 150 EOY, $SPY 350 6/30/21\n   2. Heard immunity doesn't hit. => $SPY 150 EOY, $SPY 50 6/30/21\n\nWe have shown that the current situation invariably leads to **$SPY hitting 150 EOY.** The (trivial) proof that the case distinction is exhaustive is left as an exercise to the reader. QED. \n\nThis isn't some \"WAVE II\" shit. We are still not out of Wave I! To the bears: Fuck you. To the Bulls and Kangs: Godspeed! ... and buy lube.\n\n\\*Some would argue we're already there.", "created_utc": 1593195493.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hgcviz/us_r_fuk/", "is_self": true}
