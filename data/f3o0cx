More than thousands of people actively buying options trying to make money.   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nmy question is, what if 1000 of us came together amd made a play, then collaborated to influence a stock. so on the more illegal side, we buy puts on NVDA and then get some intern to say the CEO sexually assaulted her and we all spam the story at every news outlet there is. Maybe a more legal version of it would be to all get together and protest outside a companys HQ, not allowing them to enter or exit the building and this somehow lowers their stock.   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlenty of ideas, even a few good legal ones. My question is has this been done before? Why\u2019s it not done more often? How could one go about organizing something like this?", "created_utc": 1581660640, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3o0cx/could_we_legally_organize_to_influence_a_stock/", "is_self": true}
