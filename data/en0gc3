{"id": "en0gc3", "title": "Tonight is a full moon so short $SPY (here me out)", "selftext": "Let's be honest, you buy calls/puts and then justify the decision post-fact. Here's a legitimate reason to become a bear cuck that you can still mask as autistic, because it sure as hell sounds it - but it's actually supported by *real* data believe it or not. I have linked the academic study below if you want to read (you don't) but here's the short-ish version: \n\nThe lunar cycle is the 1 month rotation of the moon around the earth and the different stages are marked by how the moon appears in the night sky. Every 2 weeks there is a full moon (full circle visible), and then two weeks later there is a new moon (no visible moon), and in the middle there is all sorts of half moons and crescent moons. The cycle repeats on and on and on every month. \n\nJust as the gravitational forces move the water on earth and cause the ocean tides, these particular alignments of the sun, moon and earth also cause chemical reactions in our brain (not sure what kind, but just go with it). On the dates of full and new moons there are higher suicide rates, higher aggression in schizophrenics, more hospital admissions, greater crime rates, all sorts of shit ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar\\_effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_effect) ). In short, the lunar cycle affects human psychology - a huge factor that affects the stock market, wouldn't you agree?  \n\nWell it just so happens that stock markets exhibit unusual returns surrounding specific points in the lunar cycle. Stock returns are found to be lower on the days around a full moon than on the days around a new moon. This leads to an out performance of 3% to 5% per year if you consider the lunar cycle in your portfolio. i.e sell around a full moon, and buy around a new moon. 3-5% is pussy shit to be left for r/investing and tbh they are way too rational to base their portfolio on the moon. However, someone here ought to buy this moon theory, and by using options instead of a plain stock portfolio maybe that 3-5% could become 3-5,000%, no? \n\nAt first I thought this sounded crazy, but you can look at a chart and see the effects for yourself. Below is the S&amp;P500 with an overlay of the full and new moons. You can clearly see the market turning from bull to bear and vice versa at a new/full moon - particularly when emotions are ruling the market e.g. Q4 2018 - look at that bottom.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b1yr5lvbt1a41.png?width=2118&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5122c788cfec1f817bdb01f067ed30c9084be51d\n\nAnyway, today (10th Jan 2020) was a full moon - when market returns are usually depressed. Not only that, it was a special kind of full moon known as a 'Wolf Moon', because it was the first full moon of the year - and wouldn't you know markets were negative.. coincidence? I think not. (BBC wolf moon report:  [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51066892](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51066892) ) \n\nThe market has been overbought for the past 3 months now and IMO this is the final signal we needed for the bears to take over. Today was negative and I'm calling the top. Monday the 13th of Jan, soon to be known as Black Monday, will be devastating - down &gt;10% at the open at least. I hope you can buy some OTM puts in time or already have some. \n\n**Enjoy your tendies.**  \n\nTL;DR - it was a full moon today so buy OTM $SPY puts or short SPY  \n\nAcademic paper 'Are Investors Moonstruck?
