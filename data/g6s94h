{"id": "g6s94h", "title": "June Monthly Puts on ZM at EOD", "selftext": "As we all know, Georgia is easing state orders for social distancing and other states will soon follow. The data from those states will probably look fine for a while because most of us have the good sense to limit our interactions with random strangers even if a few retards think COVID is fake news. I'm guessing we will have a relapse in a few months, but that's beyond the time horizon of my puts. I think the changing sentiments over the next month or so will curtail the unhinged speculative growth for stonks like ZM and TDOC.\n\nBased on the dip and recovery of ZM, people have essentially shrugged off the security issues associated with the app. Some autists have offered their family Easter spyware sessions as anecdotal proof that the company has no direction to go but up. The problem is that ZM doesn't make money when grandma uses her free subscription to virtually judge how shitty of a job your parents did with you. Revenue comes from organizational and corporate use, which is dwindling. It really doesn't matter if ZM says they have a patch. The damage is done and your company knows they will look inept if they get caught with their pants down after continuing to use ZM. It's a \"fool me once\" kind of game.\n\nThis wouldn't be a problem if ZM had some kind of service or technology that set it apart from other providers and warranted a subscription service for all users - but it doesn't. Personally, I think the app is shit for both mobile and computer uses.\n\nThe unwarranted optimism about ZM is giving me a throbbing red FOMO boner. I will be shorting this meme stonk and incinerating what little funds are left in my RH account.\n\nTLDR: easing lock-downs + security problems + no moat = ZM is fuk\n\nZM 130p 6/19", "created_utc": 1587667354.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6s94h/june_monthly_puts_on_zm_at_eod/", "is_self": true}
