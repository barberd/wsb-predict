Airline stocks registered strong gains in the second half of 2014 as oil prices plunged.\n2. **Transportation** Shipping and freight companies also benefit from lower oil costs since fuel costs are a significant expense for those industries. Among freight companies, FedEx Corp (FDX) has gained 16.0% since June 2014.\n3. **Consumer Discretionary**: This sector includes companies in retail, travel, entertainment\u00a0and restaurants. These businesses benefit indirectly from lower oil prices, as consumers looks for places to spend the money that they save on fuel.\n4. **Consumer Staples**: Although consumers are more likely to spend their fuel savings on the fun stuff, part of the expanded budget will also go towards food and drink.\n5. **Automobiles**: Low oil prices means that consumers will opt for larger and more expensive vehicles (like SUVs and trucks) over smaller, fuel-efficient models.\n\n*The benefiting industries from decreasing oil prices are highly negatively effected by the coronavirus however lower oil prices would indicate a faster recovery in all 5 mentioned industries.*\n\nDecreasing oil prices are positive for the airline industry because it will increase the recovery rate much faster than expected, it's a much more attractive investment than it was just a day ago. Once countries and airlines start opening up the recovery will be fairly fast compared to what was expected.\n\nIncreasing unemployment rates and people in quarantines won't have a positive effect on the automobile industry and therefore i wouldn't recommend investing in automobile companies, maybe it will become a more attractive investment once the unemployment rate decreases and especially after coronavirus.\n\nI'm personally going to increase my holdings in the airline and transportation industry because countries are dependent on export and import, it's a big market and will eventfully recover in a couple of years unless this virus evolves into something worse.\n\n***-Airline stocks-***\n\n* **Delta Air Lines Inc** *(-59,56% this year)*\n* **American Airlines Group Inc** *(-61,45% this years)*\n* **United Airlines Holdings Inc** *(-68,46% this year)*\n\n***-Transportation stocks-*** *(no major transportation by flight)*\n\n* **Deutsche Post AG** (-22,14% this year)\n* **United Parcel Service Inc (UPS)** *(-13,58% this year)*\n* **FedEx Corp** *(-18,78% this year)*\n\nEspecially the Airline industry contains a pretty high risk but to decrease that risk i'd recommend to divide the amount you intend to invest in the airline industry within example 3-5 airline companies to decrease the risk of bankruptcy.\n\nI'd like to hear what investments you'd recommend to invest in that are benefiting from decreasing oil prices, i'm constantly thinking of how to take advantage of this situation and i'd like to hear your thoughts, Thanks for reading!", "created_utc": 1587434061.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5697h/how_to_take_advantage_of_the_decreasing_oil/", "is_self": true}
