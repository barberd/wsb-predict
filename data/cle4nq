It urged the US to abandon \u201cits illusions\u201d, \u201cshoulder some responsibility\u201d and get back on track in resolving the trade dispute. The Commerce Ministry did however say that the door for trade talks with the US remains wide open, but that China will never give in the blackmail and intimidation. China did not go as far as to call off talks scheduled for later in the month, but warned \u201cthe US must show sincerity\u201d. Similar punchy talk followed from China\u2019s US Ambassador Xhang; he said if the US wants to talk about trade, then so will China but if the US want to fight, so will China. He added that new tariffs are an irrational and irresponsible act and reiterated the Chinese stance; that Beijing will take new adequate countermeasures against.\n\n* TRUMP: The President later said that the US has to have a better deal, not an even deal, with China; says China has a lot to do to turn things around, and he can always raise tariffs.\n\n* KUDLOW:\u00a0In a wide-ranging interview,White House Economic Advisor Kudlow walked back on earlier reports that the Trump Administration was considering delaying the tariffs should China meet certain conditions; he said he had not heard anything definitive about a possibility of China tariff delays, before adding that US President Trump is not satisfied with progress in talks. Kudlow caveated, saying that a number of good things could happen in the month prior to tariffs going on Chinese goods and good things could happen at the US/China talks in September, before adding that he anticipates a very small impact on consumers from the tariffs. Switching to the topic of the EU; Kudlow said that US President Trump doesn't like the idea that Europe is \"manipulating\" the EUR and that negative rates in Europe reflect the terrible European economy. Kudlow concluded by reiterating the Trump Administration has ruled out any currency intervention.\n\n* US/CHINA TRADE - ANALYSIS:\u00a0US President Trump\u2019s decision to put 10% tariffs on the remaining (untariffed) USD 300bln worth of Chinese imports starting in September follows the return of US negotiators from Shanghai, and \u201clikely signals that US-China talks did not make sufficient progress to convince the White House that a deal was likely in the near-term\u201d, notes Goldman. US President Trump\u2019s tweets also contained positive comments, including \u201ccontinuing our positive dialogue with China on a comprehensive trade deal\u201d. Goldman suggests that there is a possibility that this decision could be a way to apply extra pressure in a bid to extract concessions ahead of the next round of trade talks in Washington in September. \u201cIf so\u201d the bank says \u201cit suggests that these tariffs are not a foregone conclusion.\u201d This line of thinking was confirmed by CNBC reports, which suggested that the Trump administration may be willing to shelve China tariffs if China takes positive (although Chinese officials have vowed not to \u201cgive an inch\u201d according to an SCMP commentary). Goldman concludes that the tariffs are more likely to be implemented than delayed or called off. Regarding the implementation of new tariffs; most of the domestic barriers to the implementation of these tariffs have already been lifted. USTR Lighthizer released a proposed list of products subject to tariff (so-called \u201cList 4\u201d) and held public hearings. The bank now awaits release a final proposal with a slightly revised list as well as a 10% tariff rate and an implementation date (likely 1 September); these tariffs would then take automatic effect unless extra measures were taken to reverse them. Goldman points out than consumer goods will be hit the hardest by these tariffs, making up 62% of the tariffed goods. Capital and intermediate goods, which constituted the bulk of the previous three tranches, make up 38%. The bank points out that much of the new tariffs on goods will be concentrated in areas that have thus far been unscathed by prior rounds of tariffs, including apparel and footwear, Toys and phones, which raises the risk of firms passing this cost on to the consumer. As such, Goldman expects new tariffs to be politically unpopular. Regarding how the new tariffs might affect the data; Goldman expect these tariffs to push up core PCE inflation by just over 20bps by year-end, and estimate a hit to GDP of between 0.1-0.2%, added to the 0.2% hit from the tariffs already imposed. It adds that the hit to GDP could rise to 0.5-0.6% if the tariffs on USD 300bln of China imports is raised to 25%. However, other analysts have argued that these tariffs will contribute to the global slowdown, contributing to recent downward pressure on global prices from the demand side. Regarding the impact of this latest round of tariffs on Fed policy; as made clear in Wednesday\u2019s FOMC statement and press conference, trade related uncertainty was a significant factor in the Fed\u2019s decision to make a 25bps \u201cinsurance\u201d cut. Goldman Sachs concludes that the announcement of further tariffs increases the likelihood of a rate cut at September\u2019s FOMC meeting.\n\n* FED: Fed's George (voter, hawk) explains her dissent at Wednesday's FOMC, saying the moderation in the economy was in line with her outlook at the start of the year; says there are risks to her outlook, and she will be data dependent in shaping her outlook. Meanwhile, Fed\u2019s Rosengren (voter, Hawk) on his dissention at the recent FOMC vote, says that he does not see a clear and compelling case for additional monetary accommodation at this point.\n\n* NORTH KOREA: US President Trump played down the recent North Korea missile tests, saying they are not a violation of the agreement signed previously in Singapore; Trump also spoke fondly of North Korea leader Kim Jong-un. Although later reports suggested satellite imagery had shown a potential continuation of operations at a North Korean Uranium Enrichment Plant. Elsewhere, Chinese UN Ambassador said that the US cannot ask North Korea to do \u201cas much as possible\u201d while it holds sanctions on the country.\n\n\n* US NFP DATA:\u00a0Headline nonfarm payrolls printed in line with expectations at 164k, once again signalling that domestic data in the US is holding up well amid fears of global secular stagnation. Today's data is being framed in the context of US President Trump's ramping up of trade tensions, and specifically, what impact it has on the Fed's rate path; the Fed has, of course, cut rates as insurance against a slowdown and debasing of inflation expectations amid global trade wars. However, Capital Economics says that the relative resilience of employment growth suggests that trade tensions alone won\u2019t necessarily be enough to convince officials to cut rates again. The details of the report were encouraging: participation rose, and wage growth was a little firmer than expected. \"Overall, this report won\u2019t be enough to move the needle much in either direction as far as a September rate cut is concerned, but it reinforces our sense that another move next month isn\u2019t yet as sure a thing as the markets are now pricing in.\"\n\n\n* US UNI OF MICHIGAN/FACTORY ORDERS:\u00a0\nConsumer sentiment was 98.4 in the final June data, a touch short of the consensus 98.5: The expectations gauge was firmer than expected at 90.5, while conditions slipped to 110.7 against an expected rise to 111.6 from 111.6. The one-year inflation gauge was unchanged at 2.6%, though the 5-10-year gauge declined to 2.5% versus 2.6% prior. \u201cFactory orders increased in June but were revised down in May, but growth in core capital goods orders and shipments was revised down in June and May,\" Goldman Sachs said, adding that following the data, its July Current Activity Indicator remained at +1.4%. Goldman Sachs lowers Q3 GDP tracking estimate by one tenth to +1.8% (QOQ AR), leaves past-quarter GDP tracking estimate for Q2 unchanged at +2.0% (compared to +2.1% as originally reported).\n\n\n* BREXIT: The UK Conservative Party lost its Brecon, Wales seat in a by-election, which was won by the pro-EU Liberal Democrats, cutting the ruling Conservative Party\u2019s working majority (which includes 11 DUP votes) to just one and as such, increasing the likelihood that the Party might lose a vote no-confidence prior to 31 October, on which day UK PM Johnson has pledged to take the UK out of the EU deal or no deal. Notably, the swing from the 2017 election, which saw the Conservatives win the seat from the Liberal Democrats, was quite sizeable, likely raising concerns within the government over UK PM Johnson\u2019s chances should it come down to a general election. Analysts pointed out that the presence of the Brexit party in the bi-election, who have largely garnered votes from the Conservative Party, helped facilitate the Liberal Democrat win, by effectively splitting the \u201cBrexit\u201d vote (note: the UK operates a \u201cfirst past the post\u201d election system, where the party with the most votes in each constituency wins the seat and other parties receive zero representation).\n\n\n* WTI FUTURES (V9) SETTLE USD 1.71 HIGHER AT USD 55.66/BBL: Crude sold off heavily on Thursday, as trade tensions between US and China ramped up, bringing the demand side of the equation into focus. However, oil rebounded strongly on Friday after hitting fresh six-week lows. \"Traders seem to have concluded, not unreasonably, that Thursday\u2019s sell-off was an overreaction to the latest US move to add tariffs on Chinese goods,\" Citi said, \"concerns over slowing petroleum demand growth remain, but we continue to note offsetting declines in OPEC production for July, at least according to most early estimates.\" Citi also notes that declining inventories also should bolster market confidence that a projected 3Q seasonal supply/demand deficit is actually taking place, and the bank says recent supply issues in Russia as well as the US loss of production due to Tropical Storm Barry are also unexpected background supports for the market.\n\n\n* S&amp;P 500 -0.7% at 2932, Nasdaq-100 -1.4% at 7692, Dow Jones -0.4% at 26487; SECTORS: communication -1.0%, consumer discretionary -0.9%, consumer staples +0.1%, energy -1.3%, financials -0.2%, health care -0.2%, industrials -0.6, IT -1.6%, materials -1.2%, telecoms -0.8%, utilities +0.1%.\u00a0\n\n\n* EARNINGS:\u00a0Energy namesExxon Mobil (XOM) andChevron (CVX) moved higher premarket after both beat on the bottom line, however they were unable to stay in the green as the wider energy sector sunk amid risk off.Pinterest (PINS) and Fortinet (FTNT) shot higher premarket on strong earnings; both companies beat on top and bottom lines and raised guidance. Arista Networks (ANET) sunk on light cloud revenue and poor NetApp Inc (NTAP) guidance, who also subsequently sunk. Square Inc (SQ) was under pressure after the co. lower Q3 EPS guidance. Flour Corp (FLR) sunk after the co. reported a surprise loss and weaker than expected revenue. Notable other stocks advancing on decent earnings include; Newell Brands (NWL), Noble Energy (NBL), Restaurants Brands International (QSR), Motorola (MSI) and EOG Resources (EOG). Notable other stocks under pressure after reporting soft earnings include; Herbalife Nutrition (HLF) and Lyondell Basell (LYB).\n\n\n* STOCK SPECIFICS:\u00a0Risk off trade saw the stock slide continue, as the predictably negative Chinese response to Trump\u2019s most recent tariff announcement kept trade tensions at the forefront. Higher beta and China exposed sectors were the underperformers; Chipmakers Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) lead the Nasdaq 100 lower. The FANG index sunk, with analysts at Bank of America noting that Trump\u2019s new tariffs would put a dent in Apple\u2019s (AAPL) earnings. Defensive sector outperformance saw the utility, consumer staple and health care sectors comparatively well supported. Decent earnings from Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) were unable to turn the tide, the energy sector sunk with lower crude prices (compared to the beginning of the week), and recent poor earnings from the likes of Concho Resources (CXO), Marathon Petroleum (MPC) and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) dragging on the sector. Boeing (BA) was well supported on the news that the co. is redesigning its 737 MAX so that it is dependent on both of the plane\u2019s flight-control systems instead of just one. Cloudera (CLDR) shot higher on the news that activist investor Carl Ichan had taken a 12.6% stake in the co., and said he would speak with the board and management about enhancing shareholder value. IBM (IBM) spiked higher on the news that the co. is targeting single digit growth in FY20/21.\n\n\n* FX WRAP:\u00a0Friday FX action largely saw an extension of Thursday\u2019s post Trump tariff tweet moves.\u00a0Safe havens\u00a0continued their assent;\u00a0JPY\u00a0extended gains; USDJPY moving to YTD", "created_utc": 1564803269, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cle4nq/what_a_cluster_fuck_this_week_has_been/", "is_self": true}
