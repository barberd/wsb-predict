{"id": "gmkjkb", "title": "Why JD and BABA are about to have an explosive Q2", "selftext": "On 5/20/2020, this marks a very special day for all Chinese/Taiwanese couples. It is essentially Valentines Day 2.0, except much more sentimental this year especially since the day 5/20 is means to sound like \u201cI love you\u201d, and especially with this year being 2020, the phrase is extremely meaningful in that it sounds like \u201cI love you, love you, love you\u201d. \n\nTypically on 5/20, both JD and BABA experience extremely high volume sales as couple scramble to get their significant other a gift online. This year, I believe that the sales are going to break some records by a landslide to the previous years. \n\nThis is not a joke. Google it if you\u2019d like, but this day is deathly important for couples in China and Taiwan and one fuck up for the guys can mean a lifetime of asswhooping. People are literally planning to get married on this day just for sentimental value. I\u2019m sure there is going to be a giant spike of sales, marriages, and perhaps divorces (to get married to sidechicks) on this day. So do yourselves a favor and buy a single call that\u2019s 5-10% out for June.
