TLDR at bottom. \n\n\\---\n\nSo if we look back around 1 week, there was that article from Bloomberg which postulated options actions could drive price actions in the underlying. This is absolutely true since who do you think sells you those options? They're all algos. \n\nThose algos are designed to make alpha, which should be as risk-free as possible, which includes picking off pennies. The classic strategy to do this is covered calls, meaning for every 1 call contract they sell, they hedge it with buying 100 shares. \n\nI've checked some options histories today on QQQ and MSFT. Around some near expirations (which have $1 or 50c intervals), nice round numbers (MSFT 200, 205, 210, QQQ 235, 240, 245) there are some massive spikes in volume. I'm talking about 0 volume for the strikes close to it, and then boom 2000 contracts on a nice round number. I absolutely believe that is due to autists here since probably none of us are going through and calculating Black-Scholes values to get the best value. \n\nSo great, let's say 20 autists each bought 100 contacts at 50c each, so that's just $5k (which from TSLA, I believe many of you have). Some poor algo has to go out and buy 200,000 shares and add to the average 20,000,000 volume. That's 1% of the day's volume, and that's only 1 strike at one expiration. We're probably doing this across 5 strikes and 8 expirations (2 months). 40 points \\* 200,000 shares = 8 million shares. That's a good 1/3 of the daily volume we're most likely contributing to. \n\nAnd because we're focusing our WEAPONIZED DOWN SYNDROME on the second largest component of Nasdaq-100, it's driving the entire market up. Everyone is panic buying into all kinds of tech. AMD, MU, SPCE, you name it. \n\nOf course, JPOW and extension of multiples especially on tech is lending a helping hand.\n\nSo when will it end? Either when algos decide IVs are too out of whack and decide to use put/call to hedge or something else. Of course, we may also have an effect by en-masse selling our calls when we  decide we've had enough. That number may very well be $200, followed by a massive short squeeze and then decline like TSLA. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR:\n\n1. We autists have focused all our power on a stock that's 11.5% of NASDAQ100\n2. Call sellers are usually algos which do covered calls\n3. Our weaponized autism and inclination to go for cheap calls (&lt;$1) amplifies our buying power (more contracts = more shares)\n4. Buy random calls, algos need to hedge, so they buy the underlying\n5. Push prices up and up and up and up (including the index, which causes overall more buying)\n\nI'm not a debbie downer and telling you to sell MSFT. All I'm saying is that if we wanted to weaponize again, it should be in an orderly fashion, and that we should pick another relatively big one with low IVs. CSCO anyone?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6swdxc29d8g41.png?width=904&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7e03b6f4568c12e2ac78204ef0f039aa6edfd78", "created_utc": 1581399818, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f23ygu/your_weaponized_autism_may_be_pushing_the_entire/", "is_self": true}
