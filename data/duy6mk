Withdrawing ALL funds from Robinhood (and the power we have if we all do the same). #byebyeRobinhood", "selftext": "$3,625,000,000 worth of power in OUR hands (assuming a modest account average of $5k on Robinhood for all subs). We deserve better than the endless onslaught of RH's lackluster of an app; bug-filled, infinite money glitched, commission free trades no longer special, inability to reach a human being on the phone, ZERO TA tools, horrendous fills on the bid/ask, restricted accounts, constant disappointment on the \"cash management\" feature, and on and on and on.\n\nCall me crazy but our few BILLION in account value should be worth something... I'm throwing in the towel on Robinhood and initiating a withdrawal of all funds. I know some of you have already trail blazed this path and some of you have thought about it. If you have already withdrawn from RH, or want to support me, show some love with #byebyeRobinhood \n\nCheers", "created_utc": 1573503251, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/duy6mk/fed_up_withdrawing_all_funds_from_robinhood_and/", "is_self": true}
