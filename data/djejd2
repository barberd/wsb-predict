{"id": "djejd2", "title": "Short TD Ameritrade?", "selftext": "After reducing commisions to $0.00 this month, TD Ameritrade (AMTD) cut [16% of net revenue](https://www.financial-planning.com/news/schwab-and-td-ameritrade-to-take-big-revenue-cuts-after-dropping-commissions) which diminishes their net income by 35%. To compensate for this revenue loss AMTD will close 20% of retail branches. Although AMTD has great management, how will these circumstances effect the stock price? AMTD is already trading $3.31 from its 52-week low, so how much lower can we expect a company with solid fundamentals to go?\n\n My question is... would it be wise to short/excerise a put on AMTD -because the next two quaters will have greatly reduced figures- or buy AMTD now and wait for the company to recover long term?", "created_utc": 1571354354, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/djejd2/short_td_ameritrade/", "is_self": true}
