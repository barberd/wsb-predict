Enter at your own risk.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL,DR: Title you dipshit\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Company Overview**\n\nNYT, or New York Times, is a paper and web-based news service, and like all news publications have been heavily covering the COVID-19 crisis. NYT has its earnings later today, and we've spotted some unusual activity surrounding the 31p.\n\n**Options Activity**\n\nToday throughout the day we've seen massive sweep orders bought at the bid on the May 15th expiry 31 puts, the three largest orders being 2702, 1183, and 1374, all with aggressive purchase prices. Option volume as of 8:45 is near 11k, representing over 50% of the average daily traded volume of NYT. The large sweeps themselves are valued at over 4 million dollars in premiums paid, and our in house industry veteran has informed us this does seem like a directional play rather than a hedge for earnings due to the extremely expensive premium paid (>2% of underlying).\n\nAs you read this more sweeps are coming in gradually.\n\n**Thesis**\n\nIt seems like the big boys know that NYT may not beat earnings expectations. Because of the COVID crisis most people expect news outlets to perform well, so the proper contrarian move here would be to initiate short positions. We also saw large selling action throughout the day as well, perhaps the big boys unloading their positions.\n\n**Risks:**\n\nThere is always the risk that this could be an IV momentum play, where the institutions pump up the action on the option then dump once volume picks up. Judging by the lot sizes, order flow, and fundamentals however, this seems more and more like an earnings bet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf note: Seems like some of the largest orders were bought at .89 when Ask was .85. Very aggressive buying action\n\nPositions:  [https://imgur.com/a/DWzZkZX](https://imgur.com/a/DWzZkZX)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCatalyst is earnings, if ya'll are uncomfortable with the short squeeze then bail but I'm staying in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n12:36: We're dumping with big volume ladies and gents", "created_utc": 1588695463.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ge0qql/nyt_515_31p_unusual_options_activity/", "is_self": true}
