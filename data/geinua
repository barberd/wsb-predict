Scroll to bottom for TLDR.\n\nThe value of RST isn't its consumer language business, it's Lexia, their EdTech company (covered below).  Language has been a dying business for them and the equity isn't priced for growth in that sector. (Think \u201cyellow cd Roms from 1995\u201d.) That being said, consumer language is still extremely high margin and vital to brand awareness. Look at google search trends on rosetta stone with focus on Q1 activity:\n\n [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=rosetta%20stone&amp;amp;geo=US](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=rosetta%20stone&amp;amp;geo=US) \n\nAnd look at \"learn language online\" to show the interest in response to COVID:\n\nhttps://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=Learn%20language%20online\n\nIn their PQ earnings calls they said \"In Q1, Consumer Language is off to strong start\". This was before COVID. See remarks in investor letter below (read whole thing). \n\n [https://investors.rosettastone.com/static-files/04718fc3-8017-4cc6-91df-91f1f720b19c](https://investors.rosettastone.com/static-files/04718fc3-8017-4cc6-91df-91f1f720b19c)  \n\nAgain, the equity is not about consumer language, the value in RST is in EdTech.\n\nRST owns Lexia, which is an EdTech company focused on K-12 literacy. It is doing really, really well even before COVID and is an award-winning SaaS business that doesn't have much competition. Quick link on Lexia accolade:\n\n [https://pr.rosettastone.com/news-releases/news-release-details/new-report-lexia-core5-reading-finds-percentage-k-3-students](https://pr.rosettastone.com/news-releases/news-release-details/new-report-lexia-core5-reading-finds-percentage-k-3-students) \n\nLook at what just happened with CHGG. Look at GSX (Chinese SaaS EdTech) reported this morning; although it may be corrupt Chinese fraud, they reported 307% QoQ growth in users. The RST CEO is a former Goldman Banker, it's a well run company, no doubt RST has been taking advantage of this situation.\n\nSee investor letter above - RST has focused on handing out licenses to schools. This is sticky business. RST usually has an extremely quiet calendar Q1 as the school sales cycle is end of summer / early fall. So expectations are low. I expect they will crush earnings and show tons of new users across all their platforms/applications. \n\nHere are really good VIC articles about the business and valuation:\n\n [https://www.valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/ROSETTA\\_STONE\\_INC/1602994739](https://www.valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/ROSETTA_STONE_INC/1602994739) \n\n [https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/ROSETTA\\_STONE\\_INC/1193337407](https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/ROSETTA_STONE_INC/1193337407) \n\nTLDR: \n\n$RST calls. Language business will benefit from COVID. EdTech market will also benefit and is key growth engine going forward. Stock is cheap. Use limit orders on options, vol is low.\n\nRST 20c 6/19\n\nRST 22.5c 9/18\n\nRST 30c 12/18", "created_utc": 1588766408.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/geinua/rst_rosetta_stone_earnings_today_buy_calls/", "is_self": true}
