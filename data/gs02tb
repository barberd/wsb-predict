You have nothing to gain here, much to criticize, and will be worse off having read. This is for the truly retarded.\n\nYou, like me, may have lost money over the last month or two, have spilled a tear or two in shame and overall you are fucking retarded.\n\nMost people I see in the Daily discussion are paper-handing every play they can get their Jimmy in contact with and FOMO with wild abandon.\n\nYou may be wondering where the market is headed.\n\nThree broad directions things can take from here:\n\n1) NOTHING DRASTIC HAPPENS, reopening occurs in phases as is happening now, sectors may soar, sectors may pullback, but overall on the SPX and DOW no major support lines are broken, things may trade flat for 1-2 weeks, dips may occur but the OVERALL TREND IS TOWARDS RECOVERY. There will be no major crash. There may be a month of a pullback, followed by more V-shaped insanity. But overall, CHAD BULLS WITH PUSSY LONG CALLS DOMINATE IN THIS WORLD.\n\n2) VACCINE TRIALS ARE SUCCESSFUL and by fall there is a rona vaccine. Before you expert fucks chime in saying impossible, never been done before, no vaccine likely, etc etc, THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A CONCERTED EFFORT TO DEVELOP A VACCINE UTILIZING ALL RESOURCES ON PLANET EARTH SIMULTANEOUSLY. This is unprecedented and thus things can occur that are without precedent. In which case, a vaccine develops and by end of 2020 restrictions are lifted, and a SWIFT recovery resembling the great swoosh of Nike ensues. Odds of this occurring? Less than 50%. But that doesn\u2019t matter, we are going to apply simple gambling methodology at the end of this thread.\n\n3) BEAR DREAMS COME TRUE, technicals catch up with the market and a rug pull ensues, catching every Chad-bull pants down with his noodle in his hands while their wife\u2019s BF rakes in the tendies. Long term market downturn, stonks fall and keep falling, etc.\n\nWell, there\u2019s a simple play to extract tendies from these eventualities:\n\n75% of your account on raging Chad bull calls, July/Aug/Oct and even Jan 21 if you\u2019re that gay and with focus on stonks that have much room for full recovery: namely entertainment, retail, travel. Choose strikes that will give you 4-baggers and above by hitting a target of 80% pre-Rona recovery by mid July.\n\n25% on ATM SPY puts dated July and August and October.\n\nIf us dumb fucks held these positions, we could steadily rake in 2,3,5,8,12 baggers over the next couple months while ALSO COLLECTING DIPS AND SPY BREAKS OF SUPPORT AND HEDGING AGAINST RUG PULL.\n\nTLDR:\n\nCasino, DIS, entertainment, key retail calls July/Aug/Oct exp. Sprinkle in Big Tech, medical, etc. Maybe even buy some stonks.\n\nHedge with 25% SPY 300p July/August/Oct\n\n[Positions. please only a temp ban.](https://imgur.com/a/kqfKnfL)", "created_utc": 1590643115.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gs02tb/a_retards_insight_to_losing_money_less_quickly/", "is_self": true}
