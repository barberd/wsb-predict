{"id": "e03a0t", "title": "The Shatter Heard Round the World: Cybertruck and the future of TSLA", "selftext": "Well if you love cringy shit, christmas came early last night. With all the confidence of a middle schooler that did his presentation the night before, Elon put on one of the more autistic performances in recent memory.  All I can think is someone on the design team saw that article from a few years ago when some guy turned his 7 year-old kid's drawings into stuffed animals, and thought he would be a shoo-in for dad of the year if he did the same thing with his 5 year-olds drawing of a car. \n\nHowever, the design isn't the biggest issue. The biggest issue was the window shatter. Why? The truck lost all credibility after that. Elon rants about windows being the equivalent to the doors of fort knox and some 110 pound virgin breaks them with a baseball. Didn't think to test that one backstage? So for the rest of the presentation Elon has to stumble over his words while standing in front of \"bulletproof\" windows that couldn't stop a half-assed throw from a guy who was cut from his kindergarten t-ball team. Then they put up the stats and the price. But guess what? NOBODY HAS ANY REASON TO BELIEVE ANY OF THAT SHIT IS TRUE. Think about it, if Elon was so confident about the window that he would risk a live demonstration, think about all the shit they didn't actually show. And don't even get me started on the glorified barbie car reveal at the end. \n\nElon doesn't give a shit about making money, he just wants to be the Galileo of his century. As many have said, this was all for the preorders for an interest free loan. Why burn gas when you can burn cash instead? Earnings are headed back into the shitter. \n\nOnly thing that can save this Aztec 2.0 pos is a military contract. But I don't see the US being too eager to put those \"bulletproof\" windows to the test over on Tatooine.", "created_utc": 1574439977, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e03a0t/the_shatter_heard_round_the_world_cybertruck_and/", "is_self": true}
