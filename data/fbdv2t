Bloomberg, CNBC and Wall Street Journal all state that Netflix and Zoom are the few stocks that are already gaining due to the Coronavirus. \nHowever, I see TTWO, EA, ATVI, SGAMY, UBSFY, NTDOY, SNE, MSFT (XBOX), OTGLF the best positioned to win in this crisis. The less people go out, the more people stay in looking to be entertained. As the highest growing entertainment division, it is very conceivable to see video gaming profit in these condition: Self or Imposed \u201cquarantines\u201d.  I predict more ppl will renew their PS/XBOX game pass subscriptions. More ppl will dust off their PlayStations, XBOX, Nintendo consoles, and will buy new games online. As if this wasn\u2019t an incentive enough, the newest XBOX Series X and PlayStation 5 consoles are scheduled for release at the end of the year.", "created_utc": 1582989313, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fbdv2t/best_ignored_coronavirus_stocks_to_own_video/", "is_self": true}
