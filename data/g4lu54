{"id": "g4lu54", "title": "Snapchat: how bad will it be?", "selftext": "Hello all.\n\nI recently saw a bullish post on Snapchat based on Technicals. Let me offer my (bearish) perspective based on fundamentals.\n\n**The report**\n\nSnapchat released [this report](https://forbusiness.snapchat.com/blog/how-snapchatters-are-adapting-to-the-covid-19-health-crisis) on April 1st to brag about increased user engagement. Specifically, \"a **36% increase** in install volume for app ads, and a **19% increase** in swipe-up rate overall during late March compared to late February\".\n\nNow, that's good. We now have a concrete number of how much more people used snapchat, specifically, how much their revenue increased. Unfortunately, Snap didn't give a percent increase for other parts of the app. We'll assume they're worse.\n\nAlso, they decided to add into this report that they're making \"medical face shields, which will be donated to augment the N95 masks we\u2019ve given to hospitals in need\". Donated. They said donated. Pretty sure this will be insignificant to their bottom line though.\n\n**Ad Revenue**\n\nIt's no secret, we know ad revenue is down. By how much? Youtube partners are experiencing around a [50% drop](https://www.reddit.com/r/PartneredYoutube/comments/fs26f7/revenue_down_is_this_related_to_covid19/), so we'll assume the same for Snapchat.\n\n**Estimating Snapchat's Revenue**\n\nWARNING: I am retarded. Please do not make a trade solely off of this number.\n\nQ4 2019 gross revenue was $446.2M, and total expenses were $451.9M, about a 50/50 split between R&D and general administrative.\n\nLet's say Snapchat app revenue is cut by 50%, then boosted up by, let's be generous and say 30% (this is assuming more app installs than swipe-ups, and assuming all other segments are up this amount). 446.2\\*0.5\\*1.3 = **$290.03M**. That is their total revenue, estimated. A drop of 35%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Someone smart pointed out, I have to correct numbers for a 50% drop in march ONLY, will update in morning", "created_utc": 1587355345.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g4lu54/snapchat_how_bad_will_it_be/", "is_self": true}
