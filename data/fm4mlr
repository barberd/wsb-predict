I got here by searching \"Gay bears,\" which was unexpected, but welcome\n\nBefore today, I had never traded before. But after 5 minutes of browsing this sub and seeing you fools make hundreds of thousands of dollars, I was inspired. So I opened up a RH account and bought my first option. \n\nSPY 4/17 $208\n\nBy EOD, I've made $200. I know, it's peanuts to you, but to me, it's the first step on my quarantine-long journey to buying myself my very own twink boyfriend for life\n\nI'm holding this b til next Friday. \nThen buying more SPY puts. \n\nAs a man with literally no knowledge of the economy or stonks whatsoever, I can say with confidence I belong here. \n\nBy the end of the month, I expect to be your new mod.", "created_utc": 1584745179.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fm4mlr/literally_gay_autistic_bear_here_first_time/", "is_self": true}
