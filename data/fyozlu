He dumped a ton of his positions less than a month prior to the massive drop and dumped BAM the day it peaked before the drop.\n\nRichard Burr also timed his very well, but we are unable to see the positions to know exactly how well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately the results are quite delayed so can't really follow their positions or know when to get out of them before it's too late. I was thinking about charting their trades vs position % change afterwards, however, I don't have the time for that. Overall, it's quite interesting....", "created_utc": 1586553357.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fyozlu/some_senate_members_were_hit_and_miss_with_their/", "is_self": true}
