Yes, I know it's a couple weeks old, but the P/E hasn't changed much since then. Since I know you lazy slobs won't read the whole thing, the TLDR is the following:\n\nThe dot-com 2000 P/E height of the S&amp;P was 46.7 and the housing bubble of 2008 saw a max P/E of 123.7. Historically, the P/E of the S&amp;P has averaged around 16.8. So yes, at 23.6 we are definitely above average. However, we may not be as overpriced as it seems. This shit could double or triple as a market no problem. I just got fired from Wendy's yesterday, so I'm bored and decided to write this after screwing up 3 consecutive paint by numbers. And my mom only helped me with part of it, okay? Oh good, she's calling me for dinner as I write! PS, this is not financial advice.\n\nTL, TLDR: Stonks only go up. Open those calls up boys, we flying high next week again!", "created_utc": 1582406832, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7z557/why_i_think_the_market_may_still_be_bullish/", "is_self": true}
