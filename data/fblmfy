{"id": "fblmfy", "title": "A productive conversation on what everyone's watching this week", "selftext": "I feel as if the split currently for how monday is going to open is 50/50. The split might be a little more weighted but there's definitely just heavy fear mongering going on with the PUT holders. \nAnyway \n-\nWhere's the real WSB spirit promoting actual call outs?\n-\n\nNone of this /r/all BS that everyone already knows about with travel companies and banks. What are some solid dd's outside the public view people are watching?\n\n\n$MMM - I feel regardless of how this impacts their profit, it's going to go up a bunch. People literally aren't buying corona beer due to name association. People are dumb. CALLS ON MMM AT OPEN\n\n$ABT - ABT medical calls etc etc random options activity. \n\n$ZTS - This is the real ace in the hole. Kudos to anyone who could actually read this far because i'm fairly confident this is going to be big. The corona virus has been spreading to animals. \"Zoetis Inc. is the world's largest producer of medicine and vaccinations for pets and livestock.\". They're going to jump, regardless of if they pull through just for the hype train. BUY CALLS. \n\n\nAny random DD? I'll be enjoying my ZTS tendies, regardless of how the market swings they should imrpove. If the market goes up, they start to recover and gain value +profit. If the market get's worse, fear continues and they go up +profit. This can't go tits up folks. \n\n\nTLDR: BUY $ZTS (PET MEDICAL) AND $MMM (DUMB CITIZENS) CALLS FOR PROFIT. \n-", "created_utc": 1583021310, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fblmfy/a_productive_conversation_on_what_everyones/", "is_self": true}
