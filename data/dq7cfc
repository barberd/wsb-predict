{"id": "dq7cfc", "title": "How to make unlimited tendies", "selftext": " With Robinhood Gold, you can use what's called Margin to trade with increased Buying Power. So I did an instant deposit of 2000 dollars (the minimum required to access Gold Trading), and then I bought 100 shares of AMD for 3,800 or so, with margin. Then I sold an AMD Call Contract with a 2 dollar price strike to get almost all my money back (it's important to find a stock that has Call Options with such low strike prices like Ford, GE, etc). Then I use that money to buy TWO hundred shares of AMD because remember, margin doubles my buying power, then I sell 2 Call Contracts witht he same 2 dollar strike price to get almost all my money back, which is then doubled again thanks to Robinhood's Margin. I repeat this until I am sufficiently leveraged for my Personal Risk Tolerance. Right now, I am at 25x leverage because I had 2000 dollars in Instant Deposits. I then use my increased buying power to maximize my gains.", "created_utc": 1572628962, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dq7cfc/how_to_make_unlimited_tendies/", "is_self": true}
