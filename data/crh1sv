The eighth largest country in the world, it is the second largest country in South America after Brazil, and it's about one-third the size of the United States. Argentina is bordered by the Andes Mountains and Chile to the west.\n\nTo the east of the Andes, the interior of the country is flat, fertile grassland called the Pampas. The eastern border of the country is the Atlantic Ocean. Bolivia is to the northwest and Paraguay is to the north. The high mountain spine of the Andes, called the Andes Cordillera, creates a natural 3,195-mile (5,141.9-kilometer) border with Chile.\n\nThe country is divided into four regions: The Andes, the North, the Pampas, and Patagonia. The Pampas is the agricultural heartland.\n\nUnlike Mexico and South American countries such as Peru and Ecuador, Argentina has fewer native people and a large population, which came from Europe. The population is comprised as much as 95% of people of European descent, mostly from Italy, Spain, and Germany. Much of the native population died from diseases brought in by Europeans.\n\nNearly half of the population lives in the area around Buenos Aires. Buenos Aires has been called the \"Paris of South America,\" because of the European influences.\n\nThe people are well-educated and 97% of the population can read and write.\n\nSoccer is the favorite sport in Argentina.\n\nGauchos, like American cowboys, have been a symbol of the open plains of the Pampas region.\n\nArgentina is rich in animal species. The coast of Patagonia is home to elephant seals, fur seals, penguins, and sea lions. The waters off the Atlantic are home to sharks, orcas, dolphins, and salmon.\n\nIn the north, there are many large cat species such as the cougar, jaguar, and the ocelot. There are also crocodiles and caiman. Flamingos, toucans, turtles, and tortoises also live in the subtropical north.\n\nPatagonia is a sparsely populated area rich in natural resources and wildlife, including herons, condors, pumas, tortoises, and guanacos.\n\nThe highest mountain in the Andes range is the Cerro Aconcagua, which peaks at 22,384 feet (6,960 meters). Northeast Argentina features rain forests and Iguaz\u00f9 Falls. These spectacular falls, on Argentina's border with Brazil, descend along a 1.6-mile (2.7-kilometer) front in a horseshoe shape.\n\nAs the country develops it is being affected by deforestation and pollution.\n\n[Source](https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/explore/countries/argentina/)\n\nTl;dr: It's a nice, diverse country with plenty of animals, mountains and regions.
