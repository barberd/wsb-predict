{"id": "b2hk2d", "title": "Buy MIK Puts - Thank me Later", "selftext": "Michaels (MIK) is an arts and crafts retailer in North America. In FY\u201918, the company generated 49.8% of sales from general and children\u2019s crafts, 22.0% from seasonal and home decor, and 11.6% from papercrafting. 90.6% of top line was generated in the US, while 9.4% came from Canada. Although the company currently trades at a 5.28x price to earnings multiple, representing a 48.4% discount to it\u2019s one year average, I am loading up on puts in anticipation for earnings being released before the bell on Tuesday (3/19). \n\nMIK began fighting against slowing sales and margins in 2018 with initiatives geared towards improving store layout and digital offerings. The company introduced flexible merchandising areas (FMA) to promote seasonal items. There are 700 stores with the FMA layout, up from 420 (lol) in FY\u201917, which includes 238 conversions in 2Q\u201918. FMA space was used to sell back-to-school, halloween, and holiday products in 3Q\u201918, and management plans to use it to boost kids creative gift sales in 2019. These FMA stores are reflected in MIK\u2019s same store sales, which grew 3.8% in 3Q\u201918 after only growing 1% in the same quarter a year ago. It is important to note that unlike other retailers (TGT, WMT, KSS), MIK\u2019s share price does not historically trade in line with same store sales figures. After MIK released 3Q\u201918 earnings, which included a 3.8% increase in SSS, the share price fell ~28.3% in the weeks following the report. \n\nWith digital initiatives, the MIK is adopting a buy online, pick-up in store (BOPIS) model. The company expanded online selections by 35% in 3Q\u201918, and now offers over 100,000 items online. In terms of executing the BOPIS model, MIK doubled the amount of stores capable of fulfilling these orders to 450 stores. The company also brags about upgrades to its app, which has over 6.5mm downloads. I think an e-commerce push is essential for MIK to survive in today\u2019s retail landscape, and is exactly what TGT, WMT, and others have done to succeed. But in MIK\u2019s case, online sales make up such a small part of top line I don\u2019t see these initiatives having much of an impact on earnings or investor\u2019s opinions of the company. I couldn\u2019t find any specific numbers, but management hinted at how insignificant this segment is to the business. \n\nMIK has continued change in 2019, when CEO Chuck Rubin \u201cmutually agreed with the Board of Directors to transition out of his role as CEO.\u201d A CEO just doesn\u2019t leave a healthy company, so I\u2019m guessing the Board of Directors isn\u2019t satisfied with 4Q\u201918 results, and is not very confident about the future. This event caused JPM to downgrade their outlook from overweight to neutral. Two metrics that could have been responsible for the CEO\u2019s departure, and I think will hinder the business moving forward, are gross margins and costs of goods sold. Gross margins have fallen 5.57% and 3.69% YoY in 2Q\u201918 and 3Q\u201918, respectively, largely due to higher COGS. COGS rose 1.46% and 5.6% YoY in 2Q\u201918 and 3Q\u201918, respectively, and if this trend continues without strong sales, MIK is in for a tough quarter. Analysts expect MIK to report 4Q\u201918 adjusted EPS of $1.43, which would be a 20.2% YoY increase, thorough in the past four weeks this consensus has fallen (0.17%). Revenue is expected to come in at $1.78B, representing a (5.8%) YoY decrease, and this estimate has fallen (0.05%) in the last four weeks. \n\nOverall, I don\u2019t think 2018\u2019s growth initiatives will be enough to support MIK this quarter. Although the stock trades at a crazy discount, I think there is still room for it to go lower. \n\nTLDR: Buy naked MIK puts today.
