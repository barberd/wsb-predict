{"id": "e3wdri", "title": "Id there gonna be another December flash crash?", "selftext": "Last December I alot of money in the December flash crash.  Was holding AMD in stock since like 10$ or something.  Had like 25k in it before the rally, used some margin and was close to 50k-60k in stock at the highest. Everything crashed and TDAmeritrade sold my position the same day because it went into the negative.  Once they sold I was left with like 5k or something.  Well... Now im pretty much all in at Puts in Roku and AMD and things of the sort because everything is literally just as high.  I see someone bought a ton of gold options expecting short term gold volatility, so It feels like were looking at another December/January flash crash... Thoughts?  I cant force myself to buy anything other than small FD's or very short term calls if I do go bullish.  Made a decent chunk on the Roku rebound but looks frothy now.  Same with AMD and whole SPY in general.", "created_utc": 1575121101, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e3wdri/id_there_gonna_be_another_december_flash_crash/", "is_self": true}
