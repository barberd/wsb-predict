I may say some disparaging things about Disney, but that in no way reflects my opinion on the direction of their stock - I am only commenting on Netflix here. \n\nNow, I tend to get long-winded in my writing, but I'm not trying to submit an essay for you degenerates so here are some draft bullets:\n\n- Netflix has done so much cool shit with their releases in the past, but it's always gone under the radar or not been fully appreciated. Does anyone remember when they showed the trailer for Cloverfield: Paradox at the Superbowl, and it was available to watch right after? I remember thinking how much of a flex that was to the entire industry, realizing that no other company was positioned or even capable of doing something similar. Whether its movies, television, premium subscriptions, or streaming content - the current model is entrenched in the process by which it is monetized, which is to say that it is deliberately slow and hinges on the hype and anticipation of a release to ensure a return (sponsorships, advertising, product placement, IP, merchandising, etc). Game of Thrones comes to mind here for several reasons, not the least of which is that I started this bullet by mentioning Cloverfield, and both were series with promising beginnings that ended in pointless dogshit. However, in the case of Cloverfield: Paradox, Netflix was able to give it that type of a release and look good regardless of the movie's reception. That's a supreme flex, but if you're already the biggest dude in the gym, you're just alone straining your biceps in front of a mirror. Netflix Miyagi needed its own Cobra Kai so that next time it beats up a bunch of teenagers in an alley after a Halloween party, the viewing public knows who to look to and say, \"Ooooooh shit, you gon' take that!?\" \n\n- The thing is, it's hard to call the mouse a cobra here, at least in my opinion now that the platform has been out for two weeks. Disney + to me feels barren and its release calendar, while full of great IP, isn't really something to fawn over. I'm personally most interested in the upcoming Marvel series (Loki, Winter Soldier), but it's difficult to justify staying a subscriber and being trickle-fed content when I can just cancel and wait a year to binge the best selections over the course of a weekend or two. The 10MM subscribers on release day doesn't say anything except that people that frequently stream for entertainment are starved for content. \n\n- Disney is a massive corporate stitching of media portfolios with tremendous value, but much like Frankenstein's monster, it is conceivably stiff and inflexible in its operations due to the nature of its composition. The next time Netflix orchestrates another surprising/unique/buzzworthy release, all eyes will be on Disney + to meet or exceed (as is expected in a competitive market), but my expectation is that they will be unable to respond in kind for several years. All of the buzz surrounding Disney + now seems more and more like strictly paid advertising - disingenuous. Seriously, how quickly will the buzz for The Mandalorian *as a driver of the platform* diminish when on the same day as the release of its penultimate episode, Netflix drops a full season of the Witcher series. \n\n**The streaming wars will not be won by the quality of upcoming content, but first by the frequency, consistency, and novelty of its release.** Right now it seems like Disney's best bet is to become the staple family-oriented streaming platform, whereas Netflix is actually competing for most essential viewing platform, period.\n\nNow, for the shit that matters: I started building a $1,000 position in Netflix on Wednesday, buying 310/315 calls expiring 11/29 - 12/06, and 325/340 calls expiring 12/27. Took some profit on Thursday, but still holding 315C - 11/29, and 340C - 12/27. Will likely continue to load up on Monday morning and I intend to hold through to at least Wednesday/Thursday, depending on how things move along. \n\nFeel free to discuss, I'll post screenshots of my position if requested.", "created_utc": 1574538095, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e0mwje/disney_aint_shit_the_netflix_story/", "is_self": true}
