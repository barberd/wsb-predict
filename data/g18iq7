This quarter will probably take a beating and might spook investors about what Q2 could have in stores if this lockdown continues.\n\nThe puts are looking pretty reasonable with this run up and I\u2019m trying to buy some on the cheap before all hell breaks loose. What are your thoughts?\n\nLYFT $20 P 5/15", "created_utc": 1586881075.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g18iq7/lyft_puts/", "is_self": true}
