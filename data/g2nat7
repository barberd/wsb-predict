My DD is a surface level proof to Citron\u2019s report. \n\n2020 has not been a good year for GSX. It should have because stay at home order should have boosted their business. But short report come out twice for them and apparently they are getting [sued by VIPKID](https://cj.sina.com.cn/articles/view/1887344341/707e96d502000v34a?cre=tianyi&mod=pcpager_fintoutiao&loc=1&r=9&rfunc=3&tj=none&tr=9) for unethical acts and hacking yesterday asking for 8 million RMB (1.13 Million USD). \n\nThe interesting thing I am seeing is some clear act of fraud just on the surface. \n\nGo into their website, you can see all the free classes have a number indicating how many people are signed up. But all the paid classes is not showing a number. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0gmsdrc8s8t41.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2e93170aa970c44487c5f8c7f9877a1baa41128\n\nIf you click into each of the paid classes, you will see some small text on the right bottom: \u4f18\u60e0\u6d3b\u52a8\u4e2d, \u4ec5\u52693\u4e2a\u540d\u989d, which translate to: Discount, only 3 spots left. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pc269l79s8t41.png?width=325&format=png&auto=webp&s=d25bea9b088c0df41ce721d8db6cfe980440d898\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/re2ac0s9s8t41.png?width=327&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b7d34af5dbce7800c85b2e464f454b2c5a2b118\n\n  \n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uzo4fj6bs8t41.png?width=346&format=png&auto=webp&s=14429ea19895aee9970d4a62e6811b1fd62d9954\n\nIf you check a lot of the classes you will see most of them are having this little text, it is always 1-5 spots left. What are the chances most of them have so few spots left so you can join now or never? \n\nAnother very interesting thing is their app on AppStore. (This is a Chinese AppStore account)\n\nYou can see there are a lot of different usernames comment the exact same long review 1 year ago. So goes for the untrustworthy 4.8 start review. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9izruoxbs8t41.png?width=444&format=png&auto=webp&s=7da0bfc90c0e317e3af958d5e8c9e3bdd3f652e7\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2rr4farcs8t41.png?width=444&format=png&auto=webp&s=324507e8dc8938b2081ec85929df7e7cb24efdd4\n\nCitron also mentioned there are a lot of fake comments in the classes itself, so seems this is a common practice for them: \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ot8pt6pds8t41.png?width=389&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e2b07730da2b5fddf20eaaef43d10ea64cd0027\n\nNow let\u2019s talk about the [CEO](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E9%99%88%E5%90%91%E4%B8%9C/55090). He recently tweeted on Weibo about the situation. If you know Chinese, or use Google Translate on image, you can see what he is saying. He is basically saying none of these is making sense. But he did not give any solid number or arguments. All he said is a very emotional: No that\u2019s all bullshit. You guys are so arrogant you don\u2019t even know what we are doing. \n\nI don\u2019t know what you think but my gut feeling is that he don\u2019t have anything concrete to show. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i8ut57hes8t41.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=8118996242d029d10836c159872d2e5158d9ee7f\n\nBesides this He also replied with other [emotional messages](https://www.cnbeta.com/articles/tech/968093.htm). \n\nA semi famous Chinese writer also has written a response to the CEO. What this says is basically: if you have concrete earnings, them US shorting you is a great opportunity for you, just go ahead and buy your own stock. Why do you so eagerly go on Weibo and streaming rants trying to say they are wrong instead of taking this opportunity? \n\nHe also explained they are expanding to a very small market (I don\u2019t know what that is) right now, an act of desperation. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v01zvabfs8t41.png?width=584&format=png&auto=webp&s=803b1d1f7c55b3b5de100f2fad2bd20b076ea7ab\n\nIn Conclusion, Citron\u2019s report is solid and easy to prove and I see this is another LK opportunity.", "created_utc": 1587070066.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2nat7/gsx_is_the_next_lk/", "is_self": true}
