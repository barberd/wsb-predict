That's equivalent to quad Titan RTXs ($10,000).\n\nThe much more interesting line though is the 32 GB 4D XPoint memory with 8TB/s bandwidth (12x faster than the bandwidth of a Titan RTX). That would explain why Micron has focused it's energy on the next generation of Xpoint and left left first gen Optane to Intel. This 4D Xpoint I am assuming will be manufactured at the Utah plant that Micron just kicked Intel out of. It would take at least a couple years for Intel to build one of it's own.\n\nI was curious what Sanjay meant by their optimism for \"next generation memories\" in the December earnings call especially since he implied it was something other than 3D Xpoint or GDDR6. Some un-named memory and this might be what he was referring to.", "created_utc": 1554063508, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b7s7mn/intel_leak_discussion_and_implications_for/", "is_self": true}
