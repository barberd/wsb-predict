Some crude variants are already trading at negative rates, WTI is down 60% today, and we are still a few weeks out from the climax of the storage crunch.\n\nThere has been a massive retail influx of cash into USO of (super smart) people thinking that it can only go up from here, oh boy is that wrong. Many ETF's are collapsing this year do serious research before you buy and hold. What will happen to USO when crude trades at a negative rate? If you can't answer that question hold off on buying it perhaps.\n\nNot financial advice, blah blah, some meta joke about wife's boyfriend. And for the love of god stop buying JNUG leaps.\n\nHolding $SPY 6/19 250P          $Z 8/21 25P  \n\n\n\\*Edit, WTI crude[just hit $0](https://www.tradingview.com/x/3ek6Bq1Y/)", "created_utc": 1587400910.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g4w8a9/uso_shattered/", "is_self": true}
