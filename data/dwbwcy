There was a dip in the HK stock market when the market started, there was a recently bounce in October, along with global rallies, but the unrest has gotten much worse.\n\nThere are two paths forward, and there is no chance that Hong Kong market WON'T take a shit over the next several months if the violence continues to escalate as they have. There are TWO paths forward.\n\nWe have protestors using [bow and arrows](https://abcnews.go.com/International/hong-kong-protesters-wielding-bows-arrows-hunker-universities/story?id=66966924)\n\nWe have protestors [setting people on fire](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/10/asia/hong-kong-protester-shot-intl-hnk/index.html)\n\nWe have poorly trained or outmanned [police shooting protestors using live rounds](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/10/world/asia/hong-kong-protests-general-strike.html) (regardless of justification, it still happened).\n\nFirst option, the police continues to be cucks due to lack of manpower of political will, and protestors WILL continue to set the city on fire. Recently more shit has been going on in Central (the financial district) versus the outer regions. Expect more road blockages and vandalism, in general making the place a shithole for business. Crazy shit is that real estate prices, aka the backbone of the economy, has been surprisingly resilient, obviously everyone STILL expects to just blow over. If you are able to survey local protestor media you will find that they are LITERALLY prepared to die for the cause, so I think the optimism is really misguided. \n\nSecond option, the more spicy version, is if China decides to intervene, and regardless of its plans for the region, people will freak out like they did in 1997 and the stock market will take a shit because now your money could belong to the government at any time. \n\nPlays for retail investors: EWH etf (US), Hang Seng mini futures (33k USD a pop).\n\nOne caveat: a lot of index constituents are Chinese companies and do business in China. BUT IT DOES NOT MATTER, this is a play on fear and violence. \n\nTLDR: make tendies when asians kill each other instead of not making tendies", "created_utc": 1573749129, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dwbwcy/easy_asian_tendies_short_hang_seng_index/", "is_self": true}
