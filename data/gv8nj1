Glad I bought some of those \n\nThis is still down bigly from COVID impact and is currently trading around $11.80. Further upside is definitely in question as the price target has been updated to $20+ (close to back where it was). \n\nMy play is currently 6/19 $12.5 calls and these things are still cheap. Thinking about buying more. What do you guys think about this? \n\n\nhttps://dbtnews.com/2020/05/27/market-analysts-see-flexion-therapeutics-inc-flxn-gaining-to-25-time-to-buy/", "created_utc": 1591109327.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gv8nj1/congratulations_to_those_that_purchase_the_flxn/", "is_self": true}
