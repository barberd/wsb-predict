I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 4th, 2019.\n\n# **It\u2019s getting to be the best time of year for stocks, and the Dow could soon set a new high  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/01/the-dow-could-soon-join-other-benchmarks-at-a-record-as-strong-november-seasonality-kicks-in.html)**\n*****\n&gt; As November unfolds, stocks should continue to make gains in one of the best months of the year for the market, and it\u2019s very likely the Dow will soon join other indexes in setting new highs.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq both traded in record territory in the past trading week, boosted by some better economic news, a better-than-expected earnings season, and hopes that trade talks will soon lead to a first-phase deal between the U.S. and China. On Friday, China said it reached a consensus with the U.S. in principle after a phone call among high-level negotiators.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts say stocks could follow the seasonal trends higher, barring problems in trade talks. The market is starting the best three months of the year historically, and it has a few catalysts in the week ahead. There are a number of economic reports, the most important of which will be the ISM services PMI on Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; Third-quarter earnings season continues, with about 80 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting, including media companies Disney and News Corp. and chipmaker Qualcomm.\n*****\n&gt; # Top months ahead for stocks\n&gt; November is the third-best month for the S&amp;P 500, which has been higher two-thirds of the time since World War II with an average 1.3% gain, according to CFRA. As good as November has been, December is even better, and as the No. 1 month, it is up 76% of the time with an average 1.6% gain. November, however, is the month that has seen the most new highs for the S&amp;P, on a percentage basis, according to CFRA.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cInvestors likely remain too skeptical on the impact of Brexit, the U.S.-China trade talks and the impeachment hearings. They\u2019re too skeptical that the market can advance,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Many strategists say the efforts by Democrats to impeach Trump is not hurting stock prices currently but it could if there are any developments that would put his re-election in doubt.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think November and December are pretty much going to buck the emotional trend right now. The market is telling us it wants to go higher,\u201d Stovall said.\n*****\n&gt; Of the more than 350 S&amp;P companies that have reported earnings, 76% beat earnings estimates, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. Earnings are down about 0.8% for the quarter, based on companies that have reported already and estimates.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis will be the 31st consecutive quarter in which actuals exceed estimates, but as much as earnings are coming in better for the quarter, they\u2019re going down in terms of Q4 and 2020. That\u2019s not good,\u201d said Stovall. But he said stocks could be lifted by the end of the trade war, the impact of lowered interest rates and a possible tax cut from the White House.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think because the market is doing so well, it might be telling us we\u2019re underestimating forward growth. Prices lead fundamentals,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P and Nasdaq soared into record territory Friday after the October jobs report showed nonfarm payrolls grew by 128,000, much greater than expected. The number was weaker due to the strike against General Motors but not as weak as feared.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed also added to positive sentiment with a rate cut on Wednesday, but the central bank went out of its way to signal a pause in policy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe rally is definitely broadening out. The measured move is 3,200 on the S&amp;P 500 by year-end. In the last two sessions, we retested and spent some time above the 3,025 area. Today\u2019s move showed some needed power, after a jobs report that was Goldilocks: It had something for everyone, not too strong to have the Fed as a headwind but strong enough to keep recession fears away,\u201d said Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. \u201cToday\u2019s move lends some power to the bulls.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Redler said Apple\u2019s performance this week was a big boost to sentiment. It ended the week up 3.7%, at a new all-time high, after strong earnings. \u201cTraders love when Apple leads the way,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was higher for a fourth week in a row, its longest winning streak since March. The S&amp;P ended the week at 3,066, up 1.5% for the week, while the Nasdaq closed at a record 8,386, up 1.7% for the week. The Dow gained 1.4% for the week, lifted by a 301-point bounce Friday. It finished the week at 27,347, 0.2% below its all-time high of 27,398.\n*****\n&gt; Historically, industrials have had the best gains on average in November, going back to 1995. Industrial stocks have been up an average 2.9%, followed by materials, up 2.7%, consumer discretionary, up 2.6% and then technology, up 2.4%, according to CFRA data.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe cliche thing is everyone is focused on the breakout. I think the key technical event that\u2019s been developing for weeks, it\u2019s really been this rotation toward cyclicals,\u201d said Robert Sluymer, technical strategist at Fundstrat.\n*****\n&gt; He said he expects the Dow to break to new highs soon. \u201cWe think the market is strong through year end and well into 2020. We continue to think the market cycle low developed in late 2018. This is the next leg up in the bull market,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; # What are bonds saying?\n&gt; The bond market did not respond in the same way as stocks to the jobs number. Yields were slightly higher Friday but remained near or below the level they were at just prior to the Fed rate cut on Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re actually down on the week. That tells you what the bond market thinks about the economic landscape, particularly with the jobs report. I know there\u2019s a lot of enthusiasm about it,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer with Bleakley Advisory Group. \u201cThe bond market continues to send a very different message than the optimism in the equities market. The pace of job growth is still slowing, and this number is going to get revised multiple times. Everything is pointing to a slowdown in growth.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.73% Friday afternoon, and it had been at 1.80% at the end of the prior week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s a bit of moderation from the sell-off we saw last week. The Fed was pretty much in line with what people were expecting,\u201d said Ben Jeffery, a rate strategist at BMO. \u201cI think probably stocks are viewing it as the Fed is comfortable leaving rates on hold, so many recessionary fears are a bit overblown. You could make the argument the bond market is less convinced about that.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; However, Stovall said it\u2019s a positive for stocks when the yield on the 10-year is lower than the yield on the S&amp;P 500, now about 2%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI would say another positive for stocks is historically when the dividend yield on the S&amp;P 500 has exceeded the yield on the 10-year note. The average 12-month return for the S&amp;P has exceeded 22%,\u201d he said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/fMSMfhh.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Zk6ZCDD.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/Ory2tKZ.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/vDtIzbr.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kgoXJ3b.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xE5ngtV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/z6KfVTK.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ohfhFMl.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/aw5n74R.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/c6iyCwq.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZLfqEJs.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/4lgiA2G.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/PgvRk8F.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/zKsPBmS.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/nnvJEBa.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical November Trading: First Month of \u201cBest Months\u201d\n\n&gt; November\u2019s long-term track record has been stellar. It is the number one month of the year for S&amp;P 500 since 1950 with an average gain of 1.6%, up 47 times in 69 years. DJIA\u2019s record matches S&amp;P 500, up 47 of 69 with an average gain of 1.6% although November is DJIA\u2019s second best month. NASDAQ also averages a 1.6% gain in November (second best), up 33 times in 48 years (since 1971).\n\n&gt; Over the more recent 21-year period, 1998 to 2018, November\u2019s average performance has remained solid. November has opened well with gains during the first four or five trading days depending on index. From there trading has become rather choppy with gains receding through mid-month before a low around the fourteenth trading day. At which point bullish holiday spirit has kicked in around Thanksgiving propelling all indexes to a strong rally to finish the month.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b9faf85e2a54e356f1c29214261f03fa/bc2631ef216e46d9-31/s500x750/2c6005f0edfe2e0b6025767f1183dd1afd1b3235.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 11/1/19\n\n&gt; It was an extremely busy week for economic data with over 40 releases on the calendar. A vast majority came in either inline or worse relative to expectations or the previous period, while only 27% of releases came in stronger than expected or above the prior reading.\n\n&gt; The Chicago Fed\u2019s National Activity Index was the first release of the week, turning back into negative territory in September. The Dallas Fed\u2019s Manufacturing Activity index was also released on Monday and also missed estimates while shifting negative. The Conference Board\u2019s reading on consumer confidence also softened unexpectedly as the spread between present conditions and expectations widened further. Housing data was somewhat mixed as prices slowed slightly, but pending home sales was much better than expected. Wednesday\u2019s GDP release also came in stronger than expected with solid personal consumption. Core PCE and other inflation indicators like the Employment Cost Index were inline with expectations. Finally, Wednesday also saw the FOMC rate decision which resulted in rated cut another 25 bps, as expected. ADP\u2019s stronger than expected employment data, preceded a solid NFP Report on Friday. Nonfarm Payrolls were expected to show 85K added jobs in the month of October which would have been a substantially weaker number than the 136K increase the prior month. Instead, actual results showed 128K added jobs, which was better than all but the highest of estimates (140K). Another focus on Friday was the Markit and ISM readings on manufacturing. Both were expected to improve from the prior month which they in fact did but by less than estimates were calling for. Markit's preliminary PMI was originally showing a stronger reading of 51.5. Instead, the final reading came in at 51.3 which was still the highest reading since April so the report wasn't entirely bad. Meanwhile, the ISM index ticked up off of last month's reading of 47.8, its lowest levels since June of 2009. This was in part thanks to the readings on new orders and employment improving. Aside from these improvements, ISM's indices\u2014unlike Markit\u2014are still showing contraction in the manufacturing space.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/Eco-1.png))**\n\n&gt; The economic calendar slows down next week with around half as many releases as this week. Final durable and capital goods data and factory orders will take up the entirety of Monday\u2019s reports. Durable goods orders are not expected to show any change from the preliminary readings, but factory orders are expected to show moderation in September. On Tuesday, we will get the services counterparts to today\u2019s ISM and Markit manufacturing gauges. While both manufacturing readings missed, ISM\u2019s Non-Manufacturing index is anticipated to rise to 53.5. Quarterly mortgage delinquencies and foreclose data will also be out on Tuesday. Wednesday will see more quarterly data with the Q3 preliminary releases of Nonfarm Productivity and Unit Labor costs. Following this week\u2019s weaker Confidence report from the Conference Board, next Friday we will get further clarification on sentiment with the University of Michigan\u2019s preliminary November data.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/Eco-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Price-to-Earnings Around the Globe\n\n&gt; Every Wednesday, we release our Global Macro Dashboard, which tracks major data economic and market data points from 23 of the largest global economies. One stat we include is each country's P/E ratio for their respective equity markets. India continues to have the highest valuation with a P/E of 26.9. That compares to the US which is now valued at 20.1x earnings and the fifth-highest of the countries tracked. This is also higher than the average P/E for all of these countries which is 17.02. Other countries with notably high valuations include Norway, Germany, and Switzerland. Russia, on the other hand, has by far the lowest valuation of just 6.41, the only country with a P/E in the single digits.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/PE1.png))**\n\n&gt; Compared to where things stood six months and one year ago, valuations around the globe have collectively risen. The world average now stands at 17.0 versus 16.4 at the end of April and 15.1 last October. While the average multiple has increased, only 60% of the countries tracked have seen valuations increase over the last 6 months while 74% have risen over the past year. Germany's P/E has actually risen the most of these having jumped to the third-highest P/E of all countries (22.6). Six months and one year ago, Germany (EWG) actually had a below-average P/E. Multiple expansion can come in the form of higher prices and/or lower earnings, and in the case of Germany, the culprit has been weaker earnings.\n\n&gt; Even though it currently continues to hold the number one spot on the list, multiples in India (INDA) have actually fallen over the past six months from 30.4 down to the current level of 26.9. Given INDA has fallen over 2.5%, this lower valuation makes better sense than the jump in Germany. Similarly, in regards to the US, the ratio rising to over 20 from 19.28 comes is a result of the S&amp;P 500's 3% gain as earnings have been pretty flat.\n\n&gt; Compared to one year ago, it is a similar story. As is the case now, Russia and Hong Kong have had the lowest valuations over the past six months and one year, although they have risen in that time. The valuation for most countries have risen over the past year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/PE-6m.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/PE-Y.png))**\n\n&gt; Summarizing in the table below, there is a bit of a mixed picture in regards to how P/E ratios have changed with performance over the past half-year and year. One would expect the ratio to increase as equities rise, but that has not necessarily been the universal case. For countries like Norway (ENOR) and Germany (EWG), valuations have risen the most in spite of equity markets that have experienced declines over the past six months (Norway's declines being the fourth-worst of the 23 countries) and only modest gains in the past year. On the other hand, Russia (RSX) has the lowest valuation of all countries despite having outperformed dramatically over the last six to twelve months. RSX has also not seen any major surge in valuation in that time as earnings have kept up with prices. Meanwhile, other countries like India (INDA), Switzerland (EWL), Taiwan (EWT) and the US (SPY) have seen this dynamic react more in line with what could be expected.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/PE-table2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Guidance Trends Lower\n\n&gt; Our good friend (and a former boss) Laszlo Birinyi used to hammer home that \"it's all about the guidance!\" when it comes to earnings reports for specific companies. That is indeed very true as investors discount stocks based on forward projections more than what they've done in the past. On the subject of guidance, this season we've been seeing a lot more companies lower guidance than raise guidance, which has resulted in a pretty big tick lower in our guidance spread reading on our Earnings Explorer page (available to Bespoke Institutional members).\n\n&gt; Our guidance spread reading shows the difference between the percentage of companies that have raised guidance and lowered guidance over the last three months on a rolling basis. A positive reading means more companies have raised guidance than lowered guidance over the last three months and vice versa for a negative reading. As you can see, the reading is currently at -6.48 percentage points, which is well below the historical average of -2.97. (It's notable that historically the average guidance spread has been negative, which tells us that in general companies like to under-promise and over-deliver.) The guidance spread completely tanked in the first quarter of 2019 before stabilizing and rallying back during the summer. While it hasn't been in positive territory all year, the spread did briefly get above its historical average during the Q2 reporting period in July.\n\n&gt; A negative guidance reading means companies are less optimistic about the future than they could be, but it's not necessarily a bearish sign for the stock market. If anything, it gives companies an easier chance at beating estimates going forward as long as the economy doesn't completely fall off a cliff. As you can see in the second chart below that extends our guidance spread reading all the way back to 2003, the current reading is hardly a negative outlier to be concerned about. The only time the spread really collapsed was in mid to late 2008 in the midst of the Financial Crisis.

Still, GDP increased 2% year over year last quarter, slightly below 2.1% year-over-year average growth since the cycle started in July 2009.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/solid-consumer-spending_1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The composition of growth last quarter showed U.S. consumers pulled the economy along once again. Consumer spending contributed 1.9 percentage points to the GDP increase during the quarter, while government spending added 0.4 percentage points. Housing contributed 0.2 percentage points, a nice surprise after residential investment dragged on growth for six straight quarters.\n\n&gt; Business spending reduced overall GDP growth by 0.4 percentage points, its biggest drag on growth since the fourth quarter of 2015. Growth in capital expenditures (capex) has stalled as U.S. companies have shelved expansion plans amid a surge in global uncertainty.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe economy continues to muddle through at an average pace of growth,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWhile we\u2019re not surprised to see another dull quarter for capex, we\u2019d like to see business spending eventually pick up this late in the cycle. Higher business spending could provide a boost to productivity, and higher productivity could jumpstart GDP growth.\u201d\n\n&gt; Unfortunately, we don\u2019t expect to see a material increase in capex growth until the United States and China make more significant progress on the trade front. The U.S.-China limited trade deal could provide some lift as tensions thaw, but we think companies may need to see more evidence of a larger compromise before feeling confident enough to spend.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending November 1st, 2019** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9rfOCG3orw))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.3.19**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;
