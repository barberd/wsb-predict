{"id": "gqgtgn", "title": "Opinion on Evofem (EVFM)", "selftext": "I was watching tickers Friday and saw a news break talking about a new non-hormone based birth control had received FDA approval. I did some research quickly and saw it is some sort of cream that causes a vaginal ph drop, which makes it (gay bear vagina) inhospitable for JPow sperm.\n\nIn all seriousness, does anyone see potential for this to spike more this coming week? It saw little to no reaction on the news, until after market hours, when it spiked 60%......options we\u2019re almost non-existent due to low low volume. Earnings suck, but that hasn\u2019t seemed to matter lately. Seeing this as a possible opportunity to buy some cheap calls on tomorrow morning?\n\nAnyone have an opinion?", "created_utc": 1590432805.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gqgtgn/opinion_on_evofem_evfm/", "is_self": true}
