Just had a coffee reading and the first thing the lady says is Monday is a good financial day for you and you will have a big decision to make, I ain't even tell her I'm holding 4.8k in SPY 320 calls expiring Friday. She says I should take profits from 10:30 to 11:30. If this works out I'll post an update.\n\nEdit: https://imgur.com/OGNbLVY", "created_utc": 1592671169.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hcpbkd/brrrrrrrrrrrrrr/", "is_self": true}
