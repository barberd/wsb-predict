{"id": "dya75j", "title": "How to SHORT Adam Neumann, Softbank, or any other person with more money than sense!", "selftext": "We've all seen that somehow Adam Neumann was able to extract $1,000,000,000 from Softbank despite losing like $8 BILLION for them. How did he do it? \n\nWell, he basically used a bunch of fluff/crap language, said the word \"community\" more than a fat guy saying \"more please\" at a buffet, and generally looked/acted like a burned out hippy with a \"purpose\" about blah blah blah.\n\nIf you want to replicate his amazing success, start watching his YouTube videos/interviews and replicating his presentation style and pay close attention to word choice. \n\nNext, start booking pitch meetings with everyone you can get in front of. Go to https://angel.co/ and start sending a slide decks to them. Eventually, you'll get some moron rich guy/gal trying to find \"the next best thing\", and you can scam them if you make them think you're some type of unfound genius. Rich guys love finding new people to make them more money, and also being able to say to their friends when they're playing golf or at the strip club \"Hey, *I'm* the one who FOUND that new guy! He would've been nothing without me!\" Rich girls also fall for it too, because they like to prove that they \"actually are smart\" and totally don't have money only because of their husbands or inheritance.\n\nKind of like Billie McFarland when he got [socialite dummy Carola Jain](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/everything-know-carola-jain-megainvestor-181141339.html) to invest in his dumbass ideas. See, Carola Jain (no, not Adam Carolla) is the wife of a hedge-fund manager, so she's rich by proxy, but not smart. She's the PERFECT mark for a fraudster like Billy McFarland, and trust me there are A LOT of Carola Jain's out there! [Here's a list of Billionaires](https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/#3b19120a251c), and they all have dumb wifes, dumb husbands, or dumb kids that you can pitch your ideas to. You just have to find them, pitch them your dumb idea, ask for money, and then make sure you're SMART about your fraud like Adam Neumann was so that you WALK AWAY a rich person, not like Billy McFarland, who wound up in prison. If you want to make a film, pitch your idea to someone like [David Ellison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ellison), the dumb son of Billionaire Larry Ellison. David Ellison is so dumb he make *Geostorm* and *Gemini Man*, okay? It literally can't go tits up! (Well, for you at least; David may be running out of his Father's money, who the fuck knows). His other dumb daughter (who dropped out of USC too) [also owns a movie studio.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/deborahljacobs/2013/06/05/larry-ellisons-trust-fund-babies/#ece54c748e88) Starting a bidding war between these two morons for some stupid movie project would probably land you in some sort of actual Hall of Fame, not just the WSB Hall of Fame.\n\nNow, Adam Neumann *has become* a dumb person with money, and is the PERFECT person to pitch to because he's going to be all like \"Now I want to take on the next project and *REALLY* change the world or whatever. Who's out there who wants to change the world?\" And Boom that's your opportunity to pitch him some bullshit and walk away with millions of dollars. \n\nGot it?? So stop making dumb memes about retards like /u/controlthenarrative and go out and ACTUALLY make some money off these dumb rich morons!", "created_utc": 1574113967, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dya75j/how_to_short_adam_neumann_softbank_or_any_other/", "is_self": true}
