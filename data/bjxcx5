{"id": "bjxcx5", "title": "Why use any broker over robinhood?", "selftext": "I've been banned from robinhood for a few months for too many day trades because I did a day trade that I didnt think was a day trade after I already did 3 for the week. I was looking around for another similar trading app and they're all pretty garbage. They just siphon off your money with each trade with trading fees. They take a million years for funds to deposit and stricter requirements for gaining access to options trading, yada yada. I made a TD Ameritrade account like a big boi and wow, it's not nearly as easy to use nor does it make sense to make any short term trades. Is there really no better alternative for losing my money as fast as possible?", "created_utc": 1556816549, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bjxcx5/why_use_any_broker_over_robinhood/", "is_self": true}
