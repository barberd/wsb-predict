{"id": "gj9d3i", "title": "Allogene (ALLO) up >40% on smashing safety and efficacy data!", "selftext": "Two days ago we posted a write-up on the good likelihood that Allogene (ALLO) would demonstrate positive safety and efficacy data from their P1 trial in their ASCO abstract. **Today, positive results led to a >40% return after-hours. We made adjustments to our position on this news.** Here's a quick download of what was found in the paper:\n\n**TL;DR:** The relatively clean safety sheet overall coupled with our expectation that the higher dose groups will be enriched for the complete responders once we get a deeper look on 5/29 has us confident that Allogene is triangulating on a relatively safe, highly efficacious dose to take forward into further development.\n\n\\---\n\nThe ASCO abstracts including  Allogene's ALPHA trial abstract have been released. All in all the abstract supports our thesis for Allogene that we walked through in our recent write up, though we will need to wait for the 5/29 presentation for a more detailed look at the data. Key takeaways from the abstract include: \n\n1) No dose-limiting toxicities or GvHD observed: this is great news \n\n2) Only 2 (22.2%) of patients developed Grade 1 - 2 CRS, which resolved within 72 hours \n\n3) 78% ORR, including 3 complete responses. Given this was a dose-ranging study, what we will be looking for in the 5/29 readout is how the higher dose groups in particular responded, since these will likely be the doses taken into the pivotal trial.", "created_utc": 1589408881.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gj9d3i/allogene_allo_up_40_on_smashing_safety_and/", "is_self": true}
