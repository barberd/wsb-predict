{"id": "g5h736", "title": "Tyson getting Butchered", "selftext": "Recently, there was an outbreak of covid-19 cases in Sioux City, IA and a couple miles across the river in Dakota City/South Sioux City, NE.

It has spread over to Sioux City, IA. No one has been testing as much. Hell, the hospitals stopped testing for a couple weeks, for what I believe was a lack of testing kits.\n\n\nDrive by any of the plants, and you'll see the media trying to get an answer, but they won't for a while. You would think they would try to temporarily close and sanitize, but who knows how well that will work.\n\n\nHere's a little back story. Tyson has a subsidiary known as BPI or BPI Tyson. Even since the movie, Super Size Me, BPI went under hot water due to the pink slime scandal.\n\n\n[Pink Slime Article on BPI](https://mobile-reuters-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN0GC26220140812?amp_js_v=a3&amp_gsa=1&usqp=mq331AQFKAGwASA%3D#aoh=15874823931785&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reuters.com%2Farticle%2Fus-usa-beef-bpi-reopening-idUSKBN0GC26220140812)\n\n\nBPI was on the brink of closing down. It still is. Hell, they even rebranded as \"Empirical Foods\". This is going to be worse than the Smithfields incident in Sioux Falls, SD. TSN is going to take a hit. Short TSN.\n\nTLDR: TSN $50p 6/19.\n\nEdit: The Tyson Plant in Council Bluffs near Omaha, NE is flowing suit.

The Tyson Plant in Perry, IA, which is like half an hour from Des Moines, IA, temporarily shut down and is getting called out by a state auditor.
