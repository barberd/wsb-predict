I have a 20 yr old cousin who just killed himself because his losses were so bad this past week. If you\u2019re feeling down, talk to someone, be honest. People are there for you and they do care. Money is not more important than your life. If you need anything, please don\u2019t be afraid to ask. This isn\u2019t the end of the world if you go bankrupt. I\u2019m here if you need to talk to.
