I've had several messages asking about the script as well as I've noticed some comments in the weekend thread looking for some sort of TA thread were people can share plays and talk about strategies.\n\nSo I figured I'd make a post about my relatively new strategy and answer any questions as well as provide a place for people to critique/shit post my method if they so choose. \n\nHere are some predictions for tomorrow I made this morning- [https://imgur.com/a/j8SL88v](https://imgur.com/a/j8SL88v)\n\nPlays for tomorrow based off my forecasts:\n\n1.  I like to combine my model's forecast with TA to form plays, and I see some TA to back up the models forecast for NVDA. [https://imgur.com/a/UP2QcKr](https://imgur.com/a/UP2QcKr). Bearish divergence on the hourly chart for both the AO and the RSI. If this play doesn't work out intraday I'm fine holding for several days. Looking for a mid day rally in NVDA with overbought RSI on 5 or 15 min charts for a entry into puts. However, If I see signs of slowing momentum early, I might pull the trigger in the first 30 min-1 hour. Probably looking at 5/17 190s.\n2. See a similar story with AAPL, bearish divergence on the RSI, not as clear in the AO but we do have two red ticks at the end of the histogram. [https://imgur.com/a/kCgR8SJ](https://imgur.com/a/kCgR8SJ). Going back to my forecasts, I'll be looking to get in to some puts 15-30 minutes after open. Right now I have my eye on 5/17 195s. Same story with NVDA, if I don't get the move I'm looking for, perfectly happy holding as I see some signs of slowing momentum on the daily charts.\n\nFeel free to comment your own TA, critique my model/TA, or just as questions. I've gotten a lot of helpful feedback about my model from the daily thread so looking forward to some more feedback. Important note, this model is still very young and I make no guarantees of it being bug free so take that into account when looking at the predictions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "created_utc": 1554664991, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bak04y/taalgo_dd/", "is_self": true}
