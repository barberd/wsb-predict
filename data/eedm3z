{"id": "eedm3z", "title": "Tax-free tenders for weekend fap", "selftext": "6 months back I posted about rising from ashes and Here is my year-end summary:\n\nBackstory:\n\non Jan2 my RH account is 1.8k (i.e. negative -140k RH account on Jan 2nd to 60k RH account by Feb) and using some of those gains to open two Roth IRA accounts for 11.5k each in Feb to max out fy\u201918 &amp; fy\u201919 limit for myself &amp; spouse. Initially, that 23k in 2 accounts slumped to less 10K and after several trades, I went to 310k in 3 months. At this point, I went full retard on Fitbit calls which are 8 months out when it is at 4.8$ and got cucked on earnings where my 310k positions went to 30k (fit had fallen almost 2.85). so bagholded this position for 2.5 months and after the turn around of Fitbit back to 3.95$, I converted my naked 4$ calls (2700calls expiring on Jan 17 2020) as 4$-5$ call spread out of safety measure. A week later buyout rumors came and the sale happened and eventually, my position recovered back 330K( If i hadn't converted to spread this position will be 1M $ position, you are welcome WSB autist whom I sold 5$ calls for 0.17 which might have later been 2.2). After this Fitbit debacle, I mostly traded safely (relatively to my initial autism) and eventually landed well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntrading summary:\n\n* Several hundred of trades on tech stocks and SPX options.\n* no single position gain is greater than 60k I guess\n* year starting RH with negative 140k is something accumulated over 2 years (blown up several up time after breaking even) and landed at 60k positive by Feb 1st week (yolos are played only during this time).\n* Surprisingly, I even made money on puts this year despite of mad bull run.\n* There aren't many 100% yolos played in this ROTH account. Mostly 20%-30% account with 2-3 trade spreads with hedged directions\n* after Feb Mostly traded in ROTH account itself except for 2 trades in June for TSLA overall losing 53K in RH again\n* I mostly trade spreads where win ratio is 2:1 so I had the luxury of loosing twice for each win.\n* Also, I barely pick far OTM spreads. Mostly, I leg into large contracts closer to ATM with very tight spreads\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:**  I guess I went from 1.8k to 760k (including the Robinhood negative starting crap). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is a year-end update...\u00a0 \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qs9jrpvv9a641.png?width=987&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16c6f3ee2ffaf907fd1e7d9149c53eb8a5848af2", "created_utc": 1577065148, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eedm3z/taxfree_tenders_for_weekend_fap/", "is_self": true}
