{"id": "hcs31w", "title": "UPDATE to previous post: $FOUR is next $SQ?", "selftext": "Hi all, I previously posted about $FOUR but someone wanted me to add my position is here you go.\n\n$FOUR recently IPOed this past month and has been on an upward trend. $FOUR seems to be like $SQ, except it also provides services to parks, resorts, hotels, restaurants, etc. It\u2019s biggest customers are HLT and UPS.\n\nOn Friday, when the market dipped hard AF, $FOUR did as well. HOWEVER, towards EOD, although some stocks went up, and some dipped even harder, $FOUR showed its retard strength and went way tf up (bullish imo).\n\nAnyways, as the country begins to open up more, $FOUR will play a larger role. As such, I bought $40C and am up on them. I plan on buying $45C 7/17 right when market opens on Monday as well, as I believe this has more steam. Again, although past performance is not indicative of future performance, their trend shows an upward trajectory. The $45C 7/17 are cheap rn, and I think it\u2019ll go up up up as others begin to pick up on this company (again, because FOUR can potentially ride on the coattails of SQ and PYPL success).\n\nAnyone else holding positions or thoughts?", "created_utc": 1592680885.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hcs31w/update_to_previous_post_four_is_next_sq/", "is_self": true}
