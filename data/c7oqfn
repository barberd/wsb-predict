{"id": "c7oqfn", "title": "Options for recently vaccinated - Delta Force!", "selftext": "This is a second post in education on options I was planning to do weekly. It looks like bi-monthly now.    \n\nSame disclaimer:  there are plenty retards there who readily jump on and yell \"you're wrong, I know better\"\n\nGo ahead, be my guest.\n\nTo recap 3 guidelines from first post :   \n\n\\- don't buy calls if you want to own stocks.\n\n\\- don't let options expire\n\n\\- call/put parity : buying calls - selling puts, selling calls = buying puts ( on first approximation at least)\n\nNow is the next level ,    \n\nOptions are called derivatives of stocks because their price is derived from the price of stock. Or even more specific the \\_change\\_ in price of options is derived from \\_change\\_ of stock price. There is some fancy formula to calculate it and feel free to \"discover\" it through google.     \n\nThe first and most important component of that formula is 'delta' .\n\nDelta is multiplier of stock price change.  E.g. if  stock price is 30$, then delta of at the money option  (strike = 30) is 0.5.\n\nWhy?  Because there is 50-50 chance that stock will go up or will go down. Delta is probability that stock will reach the strike price.    \n\nIs 0.5 a lot ? Well, let's do the math - $30 stock goes up $1 , 30 strike call option with expiration 2 months away will go 50 cents up.  If the original price of that call was $1 then it's now 1.50 - a 50% gain. Compare it to 3.3% gain in stock price. So for 1k investment you could buy 10 calls for $1 and get 1500 when you sell it. If you would buy stock you'd get 33 shares  and you would get 1033 when you sell them.  That's why we love'em .    \n\nThen it gets more interesting.    \n\nAs I said 'delta' represent probability that stock would reach strike level. The crazy OTM options have tiny delta and their price doesn't change much - those who still keep their 60 MU calls know that their price stays pretty much the same. It's relatively stable investment now (until the other part of that formula - theta - will eat it out) . This is where YOLO game is played. Earnings are coming and you buy far OTM calls , earnings are great, stock price jumps and suddenly your calls are in the money  and now delta is substantial and you cash out and post screenshots.     \n\nThen there is a boring counterpart - deep in the money options. Their delta is close to 1 , they behave like stock. But they are still cheaper then stock.  And you can use the leverage here. Instead of buying 300 shares of APPL at 198 , you can buy 12 of 150 Calls (about 50 bucks a piece) , same 60k investment but now if APPLE goes up $1 , you get $1200 profit instead of 300. Well, if APPLE goes down $1 you are -1200 instead of  -300.    \n\nNest step is to realize that with call (or put) at the money delta of 0.5 ( or -0.5 for puts) also represent risk of loss if stock goes the ~~wrong~~ usual direction. To minimize risk you can employ 'zero-delta' strategy - buy call and buy put at the same time , It's so popular that it got special name - 'straddle' if at the same strike, or 'strangle' if strikes are apart.  Any self respected autist here would tell you 'no risk, no gain' . Unless you sell short those straddles to autist next to you. There are a bit more complicated zero delta strategies (iron condor, butterfly etc). When 1r0nyman said box spread was 'risk-free' he meant it was zero-delta and he was right. Until he was wrong.    \nAnd then there are combined stock+options strategies. Right now I am enjoying my 1.5 delta in WDC (stock + short put)  , my portfolio goes up like mushrooms after rain and I hope it will be green again soon.    \n\nOr you can sell short put and buy call and it will behave like stock but it will be cheaper.\n\nYou see, there are way more ways to lose money with options than just buying shares.\n\nStay liquid , keep paddling and don't listen to those idiots.
