{"id": "fhtklu", "title": "On the ground in Singapore: MCD puts", "selftext": "[https://imgur.com/gallery/tY6MHXz](https://imgur.com/gallery/tY6MHXz)\n\nSpoke to my Singapore contact. Weird flex on the messages, I know, but he says food and beverage businesses being hurt the most. If you've been to SG then you know shopping and eating is the national pastime. MCD is the biggest chain there (no surprise) followed by KFC. MCD dropped big today (10% and more in AH) but it hasn't dropped like the obvious travel related victims. Outbreak hasn't been too bad there since they are a model economy and country, but the PM still says the pandemic could last for a year. Singaporeans are already germaphobes as it is, so they're not gonna be out there willynilly shopping and eating. \n\nTldr; MCD and YUM puts \n\nPs. That money coming in is going right into these and other positions ASAP.
