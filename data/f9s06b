Inspired by my new experimentation with being a super gay bear for PE, and not losing money, I have a new idea: Comcast puts.\n\nFirst off, who likes Comcast? Nobody. So fuck believing their stonks go up. Here's why:\n\nThe news has been swirling a bunch of rumors about the summer olympics being cancelled, and frankly, while I doubt the Japanese would let that shit go down, it's a small possibility.

You can't collect what you can't spy on, and they've been vehemently opposed to this directly and through their lobbying company. Chrome has discussed implementing the change as well.\n\nI see another drop of 5% likely, 10% probable, more if serious news about the olympics drops.  \n\n\nSo here's what I know:  \nIn my opinion, based on overall factors in the market, we'll see a small bounce tomorrow maybe friday, when I plan to grab a variety of puts on Comcast for the near short term (1-2) months, namely the following:  \n\n\n$41.5 March 20th  \n$41.5 March 27th  \n$40 April 3rd  \n$35 July 17 (If you feelin froggy)\n\nMostly this is because they make me pay money to watch all the porn I want, fuck your data caps Comcast, now give me tendies.", "created_utc": 1582717487, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9s06b/shorting_comcast_seems_like_free_tendies_to_me/", "is_self": true}
