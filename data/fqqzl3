I am looking for some autistic YOLO plays (cheapish puts only for my \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b status)  for the next few months or so. Saw someone mention in the weekend thread that BA 5/15 $50p were going for 1.76 - which started this (ty sir)\n\nAnd before you retards say \u201caint no way it\u2019s going to drop that low\u201d - no shit. I\u2019m not in it to hold until the contract expires. Just looking to sell for a higher premium. \n\nI\u2019ve been looking at 5/15 and 6/19 LULU $100p (who is going to buy high priced clothes, esp with their stores closed down, when everyone is losing their jobs and cant afford shit). Also, im thinking their shit might be hard to size on, so ppl would be more inclined to try their clothes on first, thus limiting online purchases. Contracts are only ~2.00 at this time. \n\nAny and all replies/thoughts are appreciated.\n\nOr maybe i just made this bc im so bored on the weekend and need something to do. \n\n\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b out\n\n4/17 SPY $200p crew \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udd90", "created_utc": 1585424607.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqqzl3/autistic_option_playslottos_for_mayjune/", "is_self": true}
