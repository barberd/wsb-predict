I'm a biomedical researcher and here's why you should continue buying stocks from pharma companies over the next few months, and then sell them to some cuck before they plummet:\n\n1. As anyone with a brain knows (i.e. 5% of WSBets), most pharma stocks are rising in hope that the company will create a bear flu vaccine. That's cute until the company doesn't create a vaccine. Take Pfizer for example; as this article explains ( [https://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2020/05/20/the-man-betting-1-billion-that-pfizer-can-deliver-a-vaccine-by-this-fall/#570b4cc3382e](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2020/05/20/the-man-betting-1-billion-that-pfizer-can-deliver-a-vaccine-by-this-fall/#570b4cc3382e) ), they are betting heavy on a vaccine. The CEO's plan is to spend a billion making 20 million vaccines BEFORE THEY KNOW IF THE VACCINE IS EFFECTIVE. That way, if it is effective, they can give the vaccine to the public asap. Once another company inevitably makes the vaccine, Pfizer will have lit a billion on fire (+ opportunity cost). In short, there can only be one winner, yet companies are putting endless financial resources and human capital into finding a cure.\n2. Biomedical research is currently at a standstill. Many research assistants, coordinators, and principal investigators are not conducting research at hospitals and universities right now. For the few patients who are at hospitals right now, they want to get out as fast as possible. You know what delays that process? When a shithead research assistant knocks on your door and asks if you want to enroll in a study. Who the fuck wants to have a study explained to them for 30 minutes in the middle of a pandemic in a location that is most likely to have bear flu? No one. Similarly, universities shifting to online is going to massively fuck with academic research. The majority of research assistants, i.e. the people who actually work in the lab while the MD/PhD sucks some cock for grant money, are students at the university where the lab is located. Who is going to replace these people? For example, at the University of Pennsylvania, will they replace students with the degenerates who live in West Philadelphia? No, labs will just be less productive until things are back to normal. Plus, many universities currently have a hiring freeze, so some academics can't even hire new people if they wanted. Similarly, many universities won't even allow people in labs unless it's essential (e.g. you can enter if you need to go feed your monkeys).\n3. As this post argues ( [https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/05/every-stock-is-a-vaccine-stock.html](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/05/every-stock-is-a-vaccine-stock.html)), other stocks may benefit more from a cure than the company who makes it. \" It\u2019s not surprising that when Moderna reports good vaccine results, Moderna does well. It\u2019s more surprising that Boeing and GE not only do well they increase in value far more than Moderna. On May 18, for example, when Moderna announced very preliminary positive results on its vaccine it\u2019s market capitalization rose by $5b. But GE\u2019s market capitalization rose by $6.82 billion and Boeing increased in value by $8.73 billion.\"\n\nPositions: BA $200 1/21/22, PFE $33 1/15/21", "created_utc": 1590950944.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gu4ix7/pharma_is_going_to_plummet/", "is_self": true}
