{"id": "fujxoz", "title": "Something not priced in...", "selftext": "Huawei is still on the blacklist. They\u2019ve just reported the smallest profit increase in three years. \n\nHuawei\u2019s chairman said China will not \u201cjust stand by and watch Huawei be slaughtered.\u201d \n\nHe is implying Xi Pooh Pin Ping will retaliate against American tech companies trying to gain Chinese market share. Think Apple ban. \n\nNo that\u2019s not the play\u2014not going to happen.\n\nBut it\u2019s clear the US has started to financially hurt Huawei. This is important because 5G is considered to be of extreme strategic importance for continued US dominance as the global de facto superpower. \n\nNow, Huawei has just released their new P40 phone. And surprise surprise!!..\n\nIt has American tech inside. \n\n[Some astute tech geeks tore the phone apart and found it to contain Qualcomm, Skyworks, and Qorvo parts. ](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/03/huaweis-p40-phone-contains-us-parts-despite-blacklisting/%3famp=1)\n\nHow you ask? Aren\u2019t they banned from doing business with Huawei? \n\nLoopholes. Loop fucking holes. \n\nWhen Huawei was asked to comment on this, they stated that they would never break any US regulations and their designs are completely LEGAL... And they are right. \n\nThe Export Administration Regulation (EARS) was designed to stop shit like nuclear weaponry falling into the hands of terrorists. This regulation is now being used to stop American technology being sold to Huawei. \n\nThe current ban states that any product with more than 25% US origin content CANNOT be sold to Huawei. \n\nHowever, American companies wouldn\u2019t embody capitalism if they didn\u2019t circumvent this ban. \n\nThese dirty rotten commie unpatriotic companies circumvent this ban by having their chips made in Taiwan by TSMC, and then shipped to China. \n\nThe chips are made internationally and specifically to fall under the 25% content origin rule. \n\nBasically for the mouth breathers... these supply chains fall out of US jurisdiction reach. \n\nThe US government understands they\u2019re being bamboozled tho. \n\n[They are now deciding whether to lower the de Minimis rule to 10% or even 0.](https://lawreview.syr.edu/no-way-huawei-proposed-rule-change-to-further-restrict-exports-to-china/)\n\nNow, even though these chips are made offshore and away from US reach, TSMC uses American manufacturing equipment supplied by companies such as LAM research and AMAT. \n\nBecause \u201cAmerican equipment\u201d offshore is being used to manufacture these chips, the US would make it illegal to for TSMC to use American equipment to make chips to sell to Huawei\u2014without a license. \n\nWithout a license is just a formality\u2014god knows that\u2019s not happening. \n\nThis is called a \u201cdirect to product rule.\u201d\n\nIf the US imposed a a direct to product rule, it would make it illegal for TSMC to sell ANY chips made using US equipment to Huawei. \n\nThe US government literally wants to choke Huawei in a BDSM style torture rack. \n\nBecause even if Huawei could design their own chips and stop buying US, they would need TSMC to not use the American equipment. That is extremely difficult and unlikely on TSMC\u2019s part. Damn near impossible. \n\nThe US is basically destroying Huawei\u2019s capability to not just access US chips, but chips altogether\u2014from the largest and most robust manufacturer on the planet\u2014TSMC. \n\nThey are going for the jugular. \n\n*The Play:*\n\nQCOM, SWKS, QRVO, AMAT, LAMX, TSM\u2014these are all good plays, but these are fundamentally strong and sound companies\u2014with exception of QRVO\u2014they do not belong in the category with these titans. \n\nHowever, there is a better one from all these. \n\nA true gem \ud83d\udc8e\u2014 a gem that when you wipe the dust off, realize you\u2019re holding a turd in your hand... \n\nEnter NeoPhotonics\u2014NPTN. \n\nThis thing moves bigly on Huawei related news. \n\nWhy?\n\n[NPNT gets ~45% of its revenue from Huawei](https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/USA-CHINA-HUAWEI/0H001GSE93H2/index.html)\n\nIt moved up 16% a while back simply because Trump blurted out US companies need to be open to business with China\u2014and some things like microchips aren\u2019t even a national security concern. \n\nMy guess is he got smacked and schooled by his advisors after saying this dumb shit as the newer chips are 100% useful for military grade equipment. \n\nThat, or he had calls on semis\u2019s that day\u2014more likely he had calls. \n\nBack to NPTN... \n\nNPTN Earnings Transcript from March 2nd, 2020:\n\n[If the existing de minimis threshold were to be lowered to 10%, without other changes, we would not expect a significant direct impact to our revenue outlook.](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4328019-neophotonics-nptn-ceo-tim-jenks-on-q4-2019-results-earnings-call-transcript)\n\nThis means their products must contain less than 10% US origin content. That is why they are still selling to Huawei. \n\nThese rotten commies have plants in China and Japan and are able to reduce their origin content to under 10% and thus able to sell to Huawei being under the allowed 25% total. \n\n*Here is the conclusion:*\n\nIF the US goes all out and lowers the de Minimis threshold to under 10%, NPTN will have nearly half its revenue stream wiped out overnight. \n\nHuge. Fucking. Fall. \n\nHalf it\u2019s revenue stream. \n\n*Timeline*\n\nAny minute. \n\n[It seems Trump officials have already agreed on the new measures for the de Minimis and to alter the direct to product rule.](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/03/27/us-prepares-crackdown-on-huaweis-global-chip-supply-sources-say.html)\n\nI don\u2019t know when the new measures will be made public, but the White House is also holding a 5G summit at some point in early April with the top tech Companies to discuss slowing down Huawei in its 5G expansion.\n\n*Trade with a wind at your back*\n\nThe US China phase one trade deal states:\n\n [In the event that a natural disaster or other unforeseeable event outside the control of the Parties delays a Party from timely complying with its obligations under this Agreement, the Parties shall consult with each other.](https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/files/agreements/phase%20one%20agreement/Economic_And_Trade_Agreement_Between_The_United_States_And_China_Text.pdf)\n\nCan you put two and two together? \n\nCongratulations. \n\nCovid-19. \n\nTrump calls it the Chinese virus. China states it was released by the US. \n\nChina at the moment looks to be the pandemic expert. US looks likes Italy\u2019s retarded cousin. \n\nHowever, I think the recent intelligence report saying China is fudging their numbers will become a serious thing in the near future. \n\nThere will be a row between Trump and Xi Pooh Pin Ping. With disruptions from beer flu, China might not be able to fulfill its side of the deal to buy designated American goods, let alone can the US manufacture them unless they\u2019re considered essential (such as John Deere\u2014they\u2019re essential to food supplies). China will still have to buy John Deere from the great farmers lol. \n\nBut at some point, because of Covid-19\u2019s supply chain and global shut down disruptions, the US and China will ABSOLUTELY have to come back to the Trade deal and amend certain aspects of it. Things might not go smoothly after all this Coronavirus blow out next time they come to the table. \n\nMillions of Americans unemployed? Priced in. \n\nNot enough ventilators? Priced in. \n\nMillions Americans dying? Priced in. \n\nCorporate bonds bursting? Priced in. \n\nCompanies going bankrupt? Priced in.\n\nUS-China phase one falling apart? Absolutely NOT fucking priced in. \n\nThis could be the driving force for the next leg down. \n\nThis play has the wind at your back. As a general and specific put play if you\u2019re bearish. \n\ntl;dr NPTN pootz", "created_utc": 1585960150.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fujxoz/something_not_priced_in/", "is_self": true}
