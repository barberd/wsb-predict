I am writing to you today to express concern in the recent actions of the FRB on behalf of myself and others, whom I would expect to take action as well.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIt has become quite clear that the policies being put into action are hypocritical in the sense that - leaders in government and high profile roles have made clear that letting your kids fail is OK and that we all don't need participation trophies, however that is the exact opposite of what is currently happening with all this bail out money being given for bad behavior by companies. I won't and we won't, stand for it.\u00a0\n\nIt has also become clear that market manipulation is currently taking place and therefore I and others will be filing complaints with FINRA and the SEC.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nMargie's reply:\n\nDear Mr.,\n\u00a0\nThank you for your message below in which you expressed your views on current economic issues.\u00a0 \nWe appreciate receiving observations that bear on the Federal Reserve's responsibilities, particularly from citizens like you who are concerned about the economy.\n\nAgain, thank you for writing and sharing your thoughts with us.\n\nSincerely,\nOmbudsman Office", "created_utc": 1586529779.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fyh20w/update_from_the_federal_reserve_ombudsman/", "is_self": true}
