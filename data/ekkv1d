I never learn, I almost always hold too long.    \n\nBut since I started using different studies throughout the entire market hours, I have been a lot more lucky.    \n\nMy timing has improved to the point where I am getting out of my positions at the right time, but when it continues to climb and I am missing out on that extra 50%, I get more aggravated that I sold too early.    \n\nAnyway, I say all this because I know 90% of you deal with this same crap, so I am including my TOS study layout that I use tick by tick, I suggest you learn each of these studies and if you are able, watch the market the entire trading day.    \n\nYou might have an issue with so much data, but I have 2x 49\" top/bottom CHG90's, take one study at a time, learn what it's telling you, and then go on to the next, after a while you can look at your screen know when to make your entry, and when to make your exit.    \n\nI wish you all luck, we're all here to make money, and I am happy whenever I can help someone.    \n\nHere is the TOS layout,  [https://tos.mx/LArqrXl](https://tos.mx/LArqrXl)\n\nAnd here is my current setup,   [https://i.imgur.com/SnYnZjM.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/SnYnZjM.jpg)", "created_utc": 1578266503, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ekkv1d/lifetime_bag_holder_seeking_recovery/", "is_self": true}
