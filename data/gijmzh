They are primarily in 7 different SEA markets, a historically difficult market to penetrate.\n\nLet's financial numbers:\n\n* Digital entertainment rev increased 245% YoY\n* E-commerce rev increase 304% YoY\n* Company has NO debt\n* Reported a net loss of 1.46b -- attributed to sales, marketing, r&d, hiring additional employees (basically all the things you want for an aggressively growing company)\n\n\nTheir cash cow is this app called Free Fire. It's a battle royal game that is MASSIVELY popular in SEA. It was voted #1 game in the Google play store for 2019. This game attributes to 94.5% of their digital entertainment rev. According to this [tweet](https://twitter.com/MadsC007/status/1258508500444954624?s=20) of a guy who posts his data from prioridata (effectively a market analysis tool looking at mobile apps data), Free Fire has almost doubled in the past 30 days & India is a large contributor to that. \n\nThen we have other news like this:\n\n* [\"According to e-commerce hub and price comparison site http://telunjuk.com  which surveyed online shopping platforms Tokopedia, Shopee and Bukalapak, there was an estimated 400 percent increase in online purchases of basic necessities between March 2 and April 5.\"](https://twitter.com/DennisHong17/status/1259114836862140418?s=20)\n\n* [They have EXCLUSIVE licenses for the distribution of Riot games in SEA (Call of Duty, League of Legends, FIFA etc.) ](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1703399/000119312517291352/d363501dex108.htm)\n\n\nFurthermore, if you look at the charts -- the stock has barely taken a hit from covid. Hardly being chirped about on Reddit - this might be the first DD post.\n\nI took a position today.
