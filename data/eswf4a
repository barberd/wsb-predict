YELP allows companies to give them too much money to make them look better on their website, that's not the point of reviews lmfao. sock puppets/meat puppets/etc\n\nAlso, **I have personally heard from people in HR positions in the Silicon Valley** area that their employees literally fuck in the hallways. I'm not saying dating or hooking up every now and then is bad. You can search around as well, some stupid fucks.\n\n**Its not like GOOGLE where the company is actually work a fuck, its because they have nothing better to do, because their jobs could be automated with code**\n\nwhat im saying is:\n\n(1) this entire company could be automated with code, swear to fuck, what the fuck do you think google reviews are\n\n(2) they have nothing better to do so they fuck in the hallways\n\nThis is an easy bet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Puts on retards on fuck in the hallways because they have nothing better to do during the day and their jobs could be automated with code like google reviews.", "created_utc": 1579800958, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eswf4a/yelp_could_have_99_of_their_company_automated/", "is_self": true}
