{"id": "hc1maf", "title": "Apple Glasses DD and how it will go brrrrrr", "selftext": " tl;dr at the end\n\n# How Google Glass failed\n\nFollowing list was key reason why intensely hyped Google Glass failed miserably.\n\n* **How to use** \u2013 The product did not provide much meaningful features to user\n* **Privacy concerns** \u2013 People got pissed for shoving camera in their face without consent\n* **Looked ridiculous** \u2013 It looked unnatural and very awkwardly looking.\n* **Battery life** \u2013 It lasted 2-3 hrs\n\n# How will Apple make it work\n\n**How to use?** \u2013 Basically, it will have most of Apple Watch functionality such as notification popping up and answering calls but improved with screen size plus without having to look at your wrist every time, **Key difference between Apple Watch and Apple Glasses is Apple Glasses will be able to place notification and information on actual objects or places in real world**. Which is huge.\n\nSome specific examples basic uses of AR\n\n* Displaying iPhone battery percentage over your pocket when you look at your pocket.\n* Displaying direction on the street so you won\u2019t have to look at your iPhone or Apple Watch constantly\n* For example, touring in Paris, when you look at Eiffel tower it gives you basic historical facts right next to Eiffel tower.\n* Displays google/yelp reviews on restaurants door as you walk pass it.\n\nApple\u2019s huge cash pile allows Apple to fund R&D for VR tech and it\u2019s already buying VR companies like NextVR \u2013 company that provided VR live events for NBA games, WWE, boxing, NHRA, ICC soccer, concerts, exclusive behind-the-scenes music experiences and stand-up comedy events.\n\nAlthough Apple Glasses will integrate iPhone notification lot better than Apple Watch, **it won\u2019t cannibalize it**. Apple Watches have the features that Apple Glasses can\u2019t have, health sensors + NFC for Apple Pay (unless you want to put your face on the NFC reader) + finger print authenticator + haptic sensor feedback.\n\n**Privacy concerns** \u2013 Use of Lidar censors, simple.\n\nFor people who aren\u2019t familiar with what is Lidar I personally copy pasted Wikipedia\u2019s summary to save you a click, *\u201cLidar is a method for measuring distances by illuminating the target with laser light and measuring the reflection with a sensor. Differences in laser return times and wavelengths can then be used to make digital 3-D representations of the target\u201d.*\n\nLidar sensors are already being wildly used on self-driving car and proving their accuracy and usefulness.\n\n**Looked ridiculous** \\- Looking past history, Apple were able to make initially hated and memed Airpods into fashion statement and mega hit. I have no doubt Apple will do the same to Apple Glasses, leaked information also suggests they will look like glasses with prescription as well. Not only It won\u2019t look ridiculous, I believe it will become fashion statement and status symbol like Airpods and Apple Watch.\n\n**Battery** \u2013 Having vertical integration of hardware and software, Apple is king of battery optimization and power to battery efficiency.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nApple\u2019s seaming-less iCloud integration between devices will let Apple Glasses complete the apple wearable saga. Although, I doubt first generation of Apple Glasses will be able to pull everything off smoothly, but I am certain it will lay foundation for next generation of Apple Glasses to become essential product line to Apple ecosystem and start the AR glasses race.\n\n# How Apple Glasses will dramatically boost revenue\n\nWith acceptable price tag Apple Glasses itself will sell like hot candies. Just how buying Apple Watches alone without iPhone doesn\u2019t do much, Mass audience\u2019s interest in Apple Glasses will draw them into Apple\u2019s ecosystem, boosting entire Apple\u2019s product line. **Airpods for audio support + Apple Watch for health and fitness info, Apple Pay, and authenticating fingerprint + iPhone being hub to connect all wearables.**\n\nMy bet is that Apple will integrate their Apple Watch tightly with Apple Glasses, displaying health and fitness info and working as an authenticator with its fingerprint censor. There\u2019s a rumor next Apple Watch will include Touch ID on the watch crown, showing Apple\u2019s intentions to give the Watch sort of health tracker with personal authenticator position if rumor is true.\n\nI have doubts on Apple Glasses\u2019 long media viewing experience due to its transparent display. But if it\u2019s pleasing enough, it will also boost Apple TV subscription.\n\n**Being able to argument reality means meaningful personalized ads for users.** For example, it will give you small pop-up suggestion to dine in some restaurant when walk pass it. Or gives you hotel suggestion when you are on a trip.\n\nAlso it\u2019s very important Apple Glasses experience will be **very hard to replicate** from other competitors since creating well baked ecosystem with all devices aren\u2019t easy, not to mention their ARM chip\u2019s battery optimization.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: Apple Glasses will do what Google Glass couldn\u2019t and It will sell crazy, pulling them into Apple\u2019s ecosystem prison.", "created_utc": 1592576766.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hc1maf/apple_glasses_dd_and_how_it_will_go_brrrrrr/", "is_self": true}
