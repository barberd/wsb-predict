{"id": "gafafe", "title": "DSCK DD and tendies", "selftext": "Options are still very cheap for DSCK (Discovery Inc). Morningstar report values them at $30, currently trading at $22.58. They have shown steady growth over the last month and I believe still have room to grow. They, like most, are having a slowdown in ad revenue. Ad revenue made up about 60% of their $11bn annual revenue in 2019 in US markets, but less than 50% in international markets.  Their net income in 2019 was $2bn. As of 12/31/19, they had $1.5bn in cash and cash equivalents and have access to $2.5bn in revolving credit, none of which it was using on 12/31. They have $3.5bn in debts due this year. They have earnings coming up on May 8th. I plan on holding until closer to earnings and then offloading.\n\nThe volume isn't super high but ive been able to fill all my buys and sells. I bought some 6/19 $25c on monday and sold some this morning at 250% gain and bought more when it dipped back down.\n\ncurrent positions:\n\n$27.5c 6/19\n\n$25c 6/19\n\n&#x200B;\n\nalso, am retarded and probably did something wrong as this pops my DD cherry.", "created_utc": 1588186774.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gafafe/dsck_dd_and_tendies/", "is_self": true}
