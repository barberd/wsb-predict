{"id": "fbzl49", "title": "Anybody here buying natural gas/energy stocks?", "selftext": "So, I have around $10k in one stock (Peyto, which I think is a great company selling extremely cheap). My averge cost is $2.95, bought 6 months ago. During this time, it went up to around $3.92 (didn't sell) and last closed $2.20 friday. They've paid dividends $0.04/per share every month, and that's well covered.\n\nThe winter was not cold and so NG has been at record lows. I think during this year/next year, as production slows (because bankrupcies and capex cuts), the price will improve and especially getting closer to future projects being completed in North America for LNG exports (2,3 years out).   \n\n\nPeyto (along with other companies that have low costs) has room to grow production towards end of the year and was planning to invest more than last year before the coronavirus hits.  \n\n\nThe stock is down from record highs of 40s a few years ago, mainly becaus eof production cuts.  \n\n\nNG seems to be trading differently from oil (although still mostly down), the forward curve is higher than that of crude, with prices higher the further you go out.  \n\n\nI attached copper/crude/natural gas future monthly contract prices for reference. Thoughts?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/15sq4pek84k41.png?width=649&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fbb5a7c4332306e370ad93be9441516d77c67d09\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mwpvuoek84k41.png?width=642&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8186dc6a111a1163699cbd2703ed18e473e48bbb\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yd7gbpek84k41.png?width=637&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6dc4ee3d37dd4b33056ebe1e4521b4fd2d73d737", "created_utc": 1583092610, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fbzl49/anybody_here_buying_natural_gasenergy_stocks/", "is_self": true}
