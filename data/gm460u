{"id": "gm460u", "title": "HUYA is the most undervalued company in the history of the NYSE. Has the Killer App of the decade on it's hands. About to be the most profitable company in the world. DD Inside", "selftext": "HUYA is an Internet Live Streaming company from China with an emphasis on video games.  A bunch of these launched 4-5 years or so ago and just like in the US they ran up as people jockeyed for position in companies that might be successful in the future.  Winners and losers were picked based on guesses, tea leaves and the statistics of young companies just trying to get traction.\n\nWhile researching many of these companies one (HUYA) caught my eye as they moved their earnings up 1 month.  Companies don\u2019t rush to tell people bad news. Here is the results of my research.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHuya $1.15B Market Cap $17.13 Share Price NYSE\n\nEnterprise Value MRQ = $2.8B\n\n67.1 Million Shares Class A (The smaller amount of available shares will amplify this rocketship)\n\n[Huya NYSE](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-HUYA/)\n\nConsidered the 3rd place streaming company by American Investors.  The reality though is it\u2019s number 2 and rising fast when viewed in the macro.  It started in 3rd place in American minds because of it's size, it was started in the 3rd biggest city though and had less to do with the other companies being more successful. Has much better business model and analytics compared to it\u2019s competitors.  One of the many reasons it\u2019s price is suppressed was being listed on NYSE and not NASDAQ like it\u2019s competitors. NYSE has been more negative for Chinese stocks and less sympathetic to tech compared to NASDAQ. Sometimes it\u2019s the little things that are actually big. Currently 12.5% shorted but was as high as 74% on 5/11\n\nMost similar competitor\n\nDoyu  $2.41B Market Cap $7.60 Share Price NASDAQ\n\nEnterprise Value MRQ = $1.7B\n\n317.4 million Shares\n\n[Doyu NASDAQ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-DOYU/)\n\nConsidered the top Publicly Traded Chinese Game Streaming Company by Americans.  Has VERY FEW metrics that are better than Huya and has basically capitalized by taking early mindshare during the exploratory run up and less price suppression due to it being listed on NASDAQ. All the stats it beats Huya on are garbage stats that don\u2019t really mean much.\n\nFrom the jump we can tell that Huya is currently worth over DOUBLE what it trades for with just a cursory glance of the information above.  Let\u2019s talk about this awesome company that is about to take a rocket ship up.\n\nHuya has been working in the lab to become one of the most profitable companies that have EVER EXISTED.  We will discuss this in 3 parts\n\n1. Chinese Domestic Market =  One of the problems with evaluating Chinese companies is the West doesn\u2019t always trust their numbers.   Because of the closed nature of the Chinese Internet and language barriers it is hard for western investors to get a good grip on what is going on.  A lot of the numbers look crazy and Chinese companies in the past have used fake numbers and continue the fakery until they collapse.  This is a contributing factor to HUYA price suppression.\n\nThe video Game Live Streaming Market in China is maturing.  These companies are often called the \u201cTwitch\u201d of China.  In reality they are more like a hybrid of Only Fans, Twitch and ESPN or CBS\n\nLive Streaming is still their bread and butter\n\nTwitch Type Stuff with Gamers\n\n[Twitch type stuff with Gamers](https://www.huya.com/520jiege)\n\nOnly Fans Stuff but probably PG Rated\n\n[Only Fans type stuff but PG rated](https://www.huya.com/5920)\n\nLooks like there is even room for some men to livestream to girls or Chinese Gays.  Who knows\n\n[Livestreamers male and female](https://www.huya.com/g/4079)\n\nThe market is putting more emphasis towards live esports content. (Remember this for part 3)  Like ESPN of video games. This is happening in America as well, Professional sports have an EPIC problem on their hands.  12-24 year olds are starting to NOT WATCH ball and bat sports, they watch  ESPORTS.  Even jocks do this.  Professional sports are going to start to see a YOY erosion of viewership in the next 5 years.\n\nANYONE WHO HAS A TEEN RIGHT NOW CAN PROBABLY VERIFY THIS\n\n[This is the Future, Live Streamed eSports events](https://www.huya.com/2020cfpl)\n\nHuya just signed a bunch of exclusive content deals to secure the streaming rights of major tournaments.  The best western example of this I can give is CBS locking up March Madness and we know what a cash cow that is in America.  Huya is going to be the dominate player for future online esports content.\n\nThe Super Bowl, NBA Finals, World Series as we know it is DYING.  The writing is on the wall and it\u2019s just a matter of time. Do you want to be in on the switch NOW or once all the normies figure it out?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Huya is about to become the #1 Destination for Chinese 18-35 $$$$$$](https://preview.redd.it/qeaelfdfijz41.png?width=1183&format=png&auto=webp&s=e48adc7aa3eccb55babfeda920385647cebe2350)\n\nAbove is a graph showing traffic to the Huya website.  Note the flat line for 5 months and then on the 6th the climb starts (Just 1 month of increased traffic will be on Q1 earnings FYI)  This can be attributed to 2 things. 1. Coronavirus and 2. Huya has started rolling out it\u2019s plan to be the destination for esports viewership.\n\nHuya has always made the most money pound for pound of any streaming platform in Asia. Their business model is just better.  90% of their revenues comes from the users themselves tipping their favorite streamers with virtual thingamajigs.  The system works and Huya has been able to consistently show some of the best profits.  They have been very smart over the past few years plowing said profits into future operations to the detriment of their share price.  Domestically they used these profits for securing rights so they can shift into a global media player. I\u2019d imagine that in the future Huya sees themselves as the ESPN of China with the twitch thing on the side because it is a cash cow. (Much the same way Netflix still does physical DVD\u2019s.  (It STILL makes fat stacks of cash by old economy standards)\n\nDomestically Huya is the BEST Live Stream play and they prove it with the $$$ but you can also see the stats.  Huya makes more money per on it\u2019s traffic vs competitors and it\u2019s not even close.\n\nAlso domestically things are shifting.  Doyu is falling off and Huya continues to grow and find more audience, better stats and more money. It\u2019s got better stats and better profits than it\u2019s competitor who has double the market cap.  Huya is the king of bad timing (Outside Forces) when it comes to their value and is ahead of the curve when it comes to preparing for the future.\n\nYou can compare some of the stats here\n\n[Alexa Stats Huya        RISING](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/huya.com)\n\nvs\n\n[Alexa Stats Douyu   FADING](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/douyu.com)\n\nThrough out history Huya makes more money with less and their popularity is climbing while Douyu is falling.  In reality though this is like comparing ABC/CBS/NBC to each other in the 80-90s  they will probably ebb and flow as the domestic market changes what they are in to. Huya though has consistently shown they MAKE MORE MONEY WITH LESS and MAKE EVEN MORE MONEY WITH MORE.  The people in charge on this company are smart and make the right choices.  Unfortunately they haven\u2019t been able to reap the rewards of this work. (That changes this week)\n\nWith what people currently know RIGHT NOW.\n\nHuya should trade at $41.81 if we valued the company from it\u2019s KNOWN MRQ.  Why doesn\u2019t it trade in the $40s?\n\n1. Chinese stocks have traditionally been undervalued by US investors for good and bad reasons. The biggest reason though is investors can\u2019t trust a lot of the numbers that we see as we have no baseline for reference and the Chinese market is obfuscated.  What we do know though says that Huya is undervalued RIGHT NOW.\n2. Huya has had a history of epic bad timing.  It\u2019s the unfortunate thing about being a foreign company that is traded on another countries stock exchange.  Often you get compounded negatives.  Those negatives are further compounded by it\u2019s NYSE listing that doesn\u2019t give the same bump to tech stocks like the NASDAQ does.  Huya\u2019s share price has been epically suppressed by outside forces.  It\u2019s a spring at full compression ready to release.\n\nWe will discuss below.\n\nHuya would be on a 2 year Bull run but it didn\u2019t suffer from bad timing.  Here are some graphs to illustrate this position.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[\\\\\"Trade War\\\\\" Cycle hit HUYA hard, NYSE amplified that affect.](https://preview.redd.it/vljhdsqkijz41.png?width=1045&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bb657e179d5733e43a247916325baaac3b1a7f3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Huya DOUBLE hit by Corona, Should have been double boosted.](https://preview.redd.it/zu31hgliijz41.png?width=887&format=png&auto=webp&s=9988eb3d5105b65d673f880e4ec5ef30801a1f48)\n\nThese are the overlays of Huya and the S&P 500. Top is all time and bottom is about 10 months.  This is important for scale.  Huya would have been on a Bull Run since December of 2018 but world politics have kept it down.\n\n# Key Suppressions\n\nMarch, May, August 2019\n\nTrump fired up the \"Trade War\" with a March 2019 Deadline.  Huya was able to stave off the pain until April because it CRUSHED earnings early March but eventually even awesome earnings couldn\u2019t keep it\u2019s stock price up. Notice S&P Dips in May and August.  These was all Chinese \u201cTrade War\u201d uncertainty and they affected Chinese Stocks BIGLY.  Huya kept getting knocked down just as it was rising each of these affect were amplified by it being on the NYSE\n\n2. October 2019\n\nU.S. Commerce Department targeted companies that had human rights violations Huya wasn\u2019t one of these companies but anything bad for China has been in the past bad for Huya.  Huya doesn\u2019t have an identity inside the US market so it is just generically hurt when something bad happens to China and is generically hurt when something bad happens in the US.  For example BABA wasn\u2019t hurt so much by many of these China disruptions because US investors can wrap their hands around BABA a little better IMO.\n\n**THIS IS ABOUT TO CHANGE**\n\n3. December 2019\n\nCorona Virus hits China.  This hammers Huya which is unfortunate.  It should have actually done the opposite.  Americans will understand this if they have followed Chegg, Zoom, Twilio Etc Etc\n\n4. February 2020\n\nCorona Virus jitters hit the US.  This once again Hammers Huya.  (Should have done the opposite)\n\n5.  March 2020\n\nUS Shutdown. Same story. Hammers Huya but should have done the opposite.\n\n6.  May 13th and 14th\n\nLast week Huya is just beginning to RIP but once again it\u2019s trading is affected by US domestic issues.  Lows on these days match the lows of the S&P 500.  Huya has had decreased volume recently because the eyeballs in the US market are elsewhere and with that lower volume it is more sensitive to changes in the broader market.  **THAT IS ABOUT TO CHANGE**\n\nIn part 1. We learned that Huya should be trading at $41.81 RIGHT NOW (If it traded at MRQ instead of Market cap, LoL See MELI)  based on what we know about it and if you removed broader market issues that have affected Huya\u2019s stock price negatively.\n\nWe are now at a Stock Price of $41.81\n\n**WE HAVEN\u2019T EVEN GOT TO THE GOOD PART YET**\n\nOne of the reasons Huya hasn\u2019t been viewed as positively as some of the MANY other streaming plays in Asia is while even though they have been posting some AWESOME earnings people felt like they could do more.  At odd times they seemed to have set guidance lower than expected. Americans assumed they were sandbagging so they can beat expectations.  Cheap win to raise the stock price.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t what was going on. HUYA has been in the lab working on WORLD DOMINATION and all the work and hard knocks are about to pay off.\n\nLet me introduce Americans to [NIMO.TV](https://NIMO.TV) the GREATEST MONEY MAKING APP OF ALL TIME.  This thing is going to be a juggernaut and it is JUST GETTING STARTED\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt already has more active participation than Twitch.  This is absolute crazy sauce.\n\nTo get an idea how crazy this is TWITCH is the #32 website on the entire Internet according to Alexa\n\n[Alexa Stats TWITCH](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/twitch.tv)\n\nNimo is #4400 and just started climbing.  We just left base camp an hour ago.\n\n[Alexa STATS Nimo.TV](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/nimo.tv)\n\nThink about this for a second. Let\u2019s lop off the last number and use a basketball analogy. The Number #3 team in the nation is getting dunked on by the number  #440 team in the nation. The women's UMBC basketball team is beating Virginia.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow is this possible?  This can\u2019t be true?  This is one of the things that have depressed Huya\u2019s stock price.  It\u2019s hard to believe their numbers.  So I did some DD\n\nMany of my kids are gamers.  We spent 2 nights this week playing around with [NIMO.TV](https://NIMO.TV)\n\nI expected them to dump on it because my teenage kids are at the hater age and my younger ones just go with the flow.\n\nThey were stunned. LOVED IT.  I learned some things about it. Many of the games being streamed are not PC games. They are Mobile games.  A lot of the big streamers are using a keyboard and mouse hooked up to their smart phones.  The important part here is the cost of entry for new customers is low. Many Second/Third world countries have the infrastructure to support broadband connections and people there have adequate phones in their pockets and lots of them have phones that are just as powerful as a desktop computer in the US just a few years ago.\n\nThere are 3.5 BILLION smart phones in the world and NIMO integrates them as well as desktops.  The ceiling on this is HUGE.  Seriously the biggest ceiling I have ever seen on a product.\n\nMy kids loved the website and it was popping.  We spent hours on it having a good time.  The genius of it though is the business model.  Streamers are essentially Independent Contractors it looks like. They make money via Diamond Tips that are bought by the viewers.  Unlike the US where our privacy is the product and the media is free.  Most of the world they make you pay to use stuff.  90% of NIMO revenues come from these fees.  No advertising downturns and essentially the talent works on commission.  If you\u2019ve ever worked in sales you will immediately recognize why this is an awesome business model.  Some of these streamers are making bank and you can count up their diamonds.  Even low end streamers get revenue.  The business model is a tread mill. GENIUS\n\nIt was POPPING so POPPING I suspected it wasn\u2019t legit.  NIMO has more ACTIVE VIEWERS than it\u2019s American version that is the Number 32 website in all the internet.\n\nHas to be fake right?\n\nIT\u2019S NOT and it\u2019s gob smacking.  This is just the beginning.  We are at the bottom of the ramp and this ramp is the most distributed and balanced money making machine that has ever been created.\n\nThe world of NIMO where the numbers are crazy and can\u2019t be true. BUT THEY ARE.  Nimo\u2019s business model encourages it\u2019s users to promote their channel.  This thing is gaining traction in 12+ countries, Big Ones and it\u2019s only getting bigger.  Crazy levels of engagement.  Stuff you can\u2019t fake.  Let\u2019s start with NIMO official Social Media Channels\n\nInstagram (Not even a complete list this is just highlights)\n\n[Latin America](https://www.instagram.com/nimotv_latam)\n\n[Argentina](https://www.instagram.com/argonotoficial/)\n\n[Brazil](https://www.instagram.com/nimotv_brasil/)\n\n[Indonesia](https://www.instagram.com/nimotv_id/)\n\nThere are TONS of individual streamers with 6 figure followers on social media\n\n[One of MANY 100k Streamers](https://www.instagram.com/drspeedytv/)\n\nPsiko \u2013 Love this dude, Moroccan and I guess speaks Arabic, dude is crushing it in Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait etc etc. He is quickly becoming the most famous person in Morocco and his fame comes from the rich countries in the Middle East.

What is hard to fake is the engagement.  Read the comments on these dudes. Armies of 12-25 year olds follow and interact with them and every one of them has their [NIMO.TV](https://NIMO.TV) link in their profiles.  They are becoming legit celebrities with people YOU KNOW wanting to take pictures with them.  This is the future.\n\n[NIMO is just getting started APP statistics](https://sensortower.com/android/BR/nimo-tv/app/nimo-tv-live-de-streaming-de-jogos/com.huya.nimo/overview?selected_tab=reviews)\n\nOver 2 million downloads a month right now and has grown exponentially in the past 6 months.  It\u2019s going to be at 10 million a month by the Fall AND THIS ISN\u2019T EVEN STREAMING SEASON YET. May is actually the lowest month traditionally for streamers.\n\nFYI from my research only 1 month in Q1 had the increased traffic that Nimo has benefited from on the books and unlike much of the broad internet market it has retained and INCREASED it\u2019s coronavirus bump.  The seed for Nimo\u2019s success had already been planted. Corona was just the fertilizer.  This means whatever Q1 is Q2 is going to blow it out of the water.\n\nGive you an idea of what kind of valuations one is to place on this kind of heat.\n\n[If Mixer paid $20 Million for Ninja they should have just paid $20 Billion for Nimo](https://mixer.com/browse/all)\n\nMixer payed a streamer called Ninja $20 million plus a year to move to their platform.\n\nMixer currently has less users than [Nimo.Tv](https://Nimo.Tv)\u2019s 25th country.  Nimo has presence all over the world with top and bottom hemispheres.  This is important because it balances the seasonality of profits and bandwidth distribution.  Nimo is seriously set up to be the most stable and distributed profit machine the world has ever seen.\n\nRemember when we discussed that Huya was the most profitable Chinese streaming company despite it being the 3rd in size? IMAGINE HOW MUCH IT IS GOING TO MAKE WITH THIS JUGGERNAUT\n\nAlso the PPP of the countries that it is gaining traction in are mostly HIGHER than China and Brazils is only marginally lesser and statistically very similar.  This answers the question about profitability in foreign countries. Their profits should be the same or greater because the average PPP in the countries it is currently in should be higher than China.  Since it\u2019s distributed to many cultures it will also weather the changes in usage because of trends.  Myspace didn\u2019t have the luxury of revenue from Germany when it started losing users in the US. [NIMO.TV](https://NIMO.TV) can and it is on it\u2019s way to becoming the 800lb gorilla in a lot of these markets while domestically Huya had to claw it\u2019s way from the bottom.  I have never been more impressed with a companies trajectory and decision making over it\u2019s first few years than I have with Huya.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe reason why Huya adjusted guidance was not to sand bag as many suspected.  It was because they were cooking up the Killer App of all Killer apps\n\nIf [NIMO.TV](https://NIMO.TV) was a stand alone company it could be worth MORE than Huya but for evaluation purposes we will say that it is worth the same.\n\nBased on what we KNOW about Huya the MRQ justifies a $41.81 share price if [Nimo.TV](https://Nimo.TV) is worth that right now we should be valuing Huya at $83.62.  $41.81 x2 and in reality even more as [Nimo.TV](https://Nimo.TV) has been a parasite on Huya for the past 2 years and is just now beginning to bring in revenue and because of corona it was perfect timing to capitalize and EXPLODE.\n\nAt $83.62 with 67 Million outstanding shares we have a valuation of $5.61 Billion (Market Cap) for the most profitable streaming company in China that is trending up (Douyu @$2.41B for example is trending down and worth double of Huya currently) Huya is on the pathway to becoming the most popular domestic platform and at the very least number 2 (It\u2019s already Tops in profit).  To be honest a 2.8 Billion Market Cap is UNDERVALUED for the Chinese properties.  It\u2019s MRQ has suffered because Huya has been financing it\u2019s rollout of Nimo for the past 2 years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe are now at the Stock Price $83.62\n\nBUT WE HAVEN\u2019T EVEN GOT TO THE GOOD PART YET.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about value.\n\nWHY IS HUYA SO UNDERVALUED?  Timing, Politics and Trust\n\nHuya can\u2019t help it\u2019s timing.  It just got dumped on chronologically because of many things outside it\u2019s control, Politics becomes less of an issue the bigger and more recognizable you get.  That\u2019s why BABA, BIDU and soon JD fluctuate less when bad China news happens. They still fluctuate but less and rebound faster.  The world is about to find out about HUYA and it will receive the same benefit.  Trust,  When I started my research on Chinese companies I came into this as a skeptic.  PDD, IQ, Doyu and others. I looked at them all and I was trying to find things that didn\u2019t smell right and were possibly faked.  We hear all the time about Chinese companies and their shenanigans.  Huya seemed to be totally legit and I believe all of their Chinese numbers are legit.  I can\u2019t really verify a lot of it because of the Great Firewall of China and the nature of the closed Chinese Internet.\n\nWe can however verify a lot of the Metrics on [NIMO.TV](https://NIMO.TV) and the gas pedal has been slammed to the floor on this property and it has just gotten started.\n\nSo what is Huya actually worth?\n\n[SE $19 Billion Market Cap](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-SE/)\n\n$19.4 Billion 313.9 Million shares $61.96 share price\n\nThis is SEA.  They make stuff like Garena Free Fire and mobile games.  They are a revenue monster but like many internet companies not super profitable (Unlike Huya) they have a $19B valuation.  Why? Well the company does have legit potential but it has avoided a lot of the blows that Huya got because it\u2019s based in Singapore which has a positive relationship with the US and the openness of it\u2019s internet allows for more scrutiny of it\u2019s operations.  It\u2019s worth this because of it\u2019s revenue and it\u2019s POTENTIAL to be as profitable as a company like HUYA has already proven it can do.  Huya is worth MORE than SE because SE\u2019s value is dependent on it\u2019s properties.  Most things don\u2019t have minecraft levels of sustained enthusiasm and good companies can still release good products that don\u2019t get traction in the market place (See Gameboy Micro) Huya makes profits off of the labors of companies like SE and if SE falters there will be another product to replace it.\n\nHuya will have SE levels of revenue or more this year AND Huya levels of profitability. Remember Q1 2020 only has 1 month of the needle being pegged and it takes awhile for new users to start paying and understanding the platform.  Whatever increases in Q1 I suspect double or more of that will happen in Q2\n\nIf Huya was valued like SE by obtaining similar revenue levels (and it should be more as it\u2019s super profitable) It would be trading at $290+\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNOW FOR THE GOOD PART\u2026\u2026  Everything you have read to this point are Third and Second Place when it comes to the valuation of Huya\n\n[DKNG $20 Billion Market Cap](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-DKNG/)\n\n$29.23 Share Price 20.6B Market Cap 705 Million Shares\n\nThis is Draft Kings. They are an American gambling website.  The US market for Sports Gambling is about $880 Million and Projected to be up to $8 Billion in 5 years\n\nSports Gambling Worldwide is about a $110 Billion enterprise of both legal and illegal gambling. So Draft Kings is worth $20.6 Billion RIGHT NOW because of it\u2019s POTENTIAL to have a piece of an $8 Billion Industry (Maybe in 5 years) What do you think DKNG\u2019s market share will be?  Even if it\u2019s 30% (Optimistic) we are talking about $2 Billion in revenue in 5 years.  Watching sports on TV is going the way of the Digital Camera, rear wheel drive sedan and the Travel Agent.  In five years these 17-22 year olds watching Nimo will be 22-27 making money and playing video games.  They won\u2019t be using Draft Kings. As big as esports are to watch (It\u2019s legit big with massive tournaments in places like the Staples Center and Prize money in the millions with endorsements from companies as big as Honda) there is even MORE money in esports gambling.\n\nEsports Gambling is a $15 Billion Dollar Industry RIGHT NOW.  If American Sports gambling is going to grow from $800 million to $8 Billion over the next 5 years how big will the esports gambling market be just in the US? How big worldwide?  At some point esports will overtake Sports Gambling just like the Smart phone overtook the Digital Camera Market.  I personally predict that in 7 years esports gambling will overtake Sports Gambling\n\nDKNG is worth $20 Billion and part of an Industry that is 1/20th the size of the esports gambling industry RIGHT NOW.  It\u2019s entire platform is centered around just gambling. Huya hasn\u2019t even tapped that part of their market and the portion they are eating is currently 20x larger.\n\nBrazil is one of the countries Nimo is booming in and Brazil is also a country with lots of Sports Gamblers.  Bet365 is in the Top 50 websites in Brazil for Internet Traffic\n\nWHY IS THIS IMPORTANT\n\n[LOL, This is an 18x Bigger market than US Sports Gambling and LESS competitors](https://preview.redd.it/wzzqwhsrijz41.png?width=794&format=png&auto=webp&s=997473de15a392ad58c029e9a490211acbcf0a34)\n\nHidden in the Nimo App is this little nugget, Huya has spent the last couple years cooking up and rolling out the Killer App [Nimo.TV](https://Nimo.TV) that could possibly be one of the most profitable Internet properties ever and they are about to pour gasoline on that fire.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMY ADVICE if you have any positions in any of their competitors. SELL IT AND BUY HUYA  If you have stock in MELI SELL IT AND BUY HUYA if you have DKNG SELL HALF AND BUY HUYA if you have SPCE SELL IT AND BUY HUYA\n\nBUY HUYA.  It\u2019s possibly the most undervalued stock ever.  It\u2019s not going to be a secret much longer.  Tick Tock time is running out, Earnings are Wednesday evening and if what I suspect is right it is going to be an EPIC GAP UP\n\nSynopsis\n\nHuya is the most under valued stock in the past 50 years.  Political, Cultural and Timing issues have suppressed the Stock.  About to announce BIG EARNINGS AND GUIDANCE May 20th  They have a Killer App called [Nimo.TV](https://Nimo.TV) that has more active users than [Twitch.tv](https://Twitch.tv) the company is ridiculously profitable, Chinese Numbers have always been suspect but a lot of NIMO metrics can be verified and it is BLOWING UP.  HUYA is booming, [NIMO.tv](https://NIMO.tv) is worth more than Huya and they are working on something even more profitable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBuy in this order of priority.\n\n101 Shares or 20/80 Shares/Options = Big Bank Rolls\n\n10 Shares or Even 1 = Small Bank Roll\n\n20C or 21C 5/22 (It's already blowing up while I prepare this DD)\n\n$35C 1/15/21\n\nStrikes that are $0.05 \u201cLottery Tickets\u201d (Load Up)  5/22 (These may not exist anymore)\n\n$34C 10/16\n\n$40C 1/15/21\n\nSmaller Bank rolls buy 1, 5 or 10 shares but the shares are important.  The option is the seed and the shares are for watering said seed. Over 100 is the magic number as then you can buy/sell covered options like the big boys.  Plus if all you retards bought shares while you are buying options the magnified effect is like dropping bread crumbs to the algos.  This stock has a lot of pent up demand and occasionally high percentage of shorts.  This stock should GAP UP BIGLY ON THURSDAY\n\nFor all you crayon users look at this beauty within context of the information you just read.  This is what a rocket ship right before takeoff looks like.\n\n[Insert Crayon Drawings](https://preview.redd.it/sf0yg0nuijz41.png?width=1376&format=png&auto=webp&s=be112ca000d749ad80c6ef1365c109671ddcd6f1)\n\nHere someone or some computer has created a map to predict where said gap will  start.  I suspect this was made by a computer.  GIGO\n\n[Where it should actually gap up to..... TBH](https://preview.redd.it/o8f37ojwijz41.png?width=1072&format=png&auto=webp&s=fcabf1f058e13c0ddbb246fa3082d74fb9afd6b1)\n\nA human would know that the previous 12 months of this crayon drawing isn't actually flat.  A base was being built with which Huya is going to launch from after it reports earnings.  I count back at least 12 months worth of outside of Huya's control market disruptions.  That's why Huya has traded flat for probably 18 months of it's existence if you looks at the numbers with no context.  These price targets aren't for 12 months in the future it's for 6 months in the past AND Huya is straight killing it.\n\nHow much is a company worth that punches up domestically and then goes on a rampage of worldwide domination in markets that speak 20+ different languages with an army of of their target audience talking about it everywhere?\n\nIF DKNG is worth $20 Billion for a chance to get a PIECE of an $8 Billion market in five years how much is a company that is in a position to eat half the watermelon or more of a $15 Billion dollar market RIGHT NOW?\n\nSE is worth $19 Billion and doesn't have the balance sheet of Huya.  [Nimo.TV](https://Nimo.TV) is the most killer app of all killer apps that have ever existed.\n\nNimo\n\nSomeone else makes the games.\n\nSomeone else plays the games\n\nSomeone else advertises\n\nAll you do is sell the diamonds and take the \u0432\u044b\u0301\u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b\u0448\n\nThe worlds greatest tendy printing machine is already rolling in like 11 countries.
