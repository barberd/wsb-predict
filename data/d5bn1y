(details inside)", "selftext": "Alright fellow degenerates, $EA releases FIFA 2020 on Sept. 27 in North America and Sept. 29 worldwide. This is why short-term calls on the hype is a must:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The best-selling PlayStation 4 video game title in 2016 was FIFA 17, which sold 10.03 million units. (source: VGChartz, 2017)\n* EA\u2019s *FIFA* is built on an arsenal of real-world data. Professional soccer consists of 800 teams (comprised of 18,000 players) across a variety of countries, and each is represented in-game (source: Western Digital blog) [https://datamakespossible.westerndigital.com/meet-data-master-ea-sports-fifa/](https://datamakespossible.westerndigital.com/meet-data-master-ea-sports-fifa/)\n* FIFA 19's \"Ultimate Team\" made up 28% of EA's revenue last year ... just one portion of the FIFA video game series (source:\" PCGamesN) [https://www.pcgamesn.com/fifa-ultimate-team-revenue](https://www.pcgamesn.com/fifa-ultimate-team-revenue)\n* 95% of the planet's purchasing power is outside the U.S. and soccer, for some strange reason, is popular in countries not named \"U S of A\".  \n\n\nBelow, you will see the stock chart from last year for the week leading up to the FIFA 2019 release. While the chart doesn't show it, 52 weeks ago, the stock had gone down 1%, then climbed a little more than 5% going into the release, for a total of a 6% climb. Now, previous behavior is not indicative of future behavior, and we have FOMC coming up which will affect the markets as a whole. \n\n**My suggested play:**\n\nTake a small position tomorrow (Tuesday, Sept. 17). After FOMC, consider DCA'ing into your position and ride your calls into TendieTown^(TM). Offload those motherfuckers on Monday, Sept. 26. Ride the hype, and sell DAT NEWS!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/xz2uiy0mt2n31.png", "created_utc": 1568692378, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d5bn1y/the_case_for_short_term_ea_calls_its_fifa_baby/", "is_self": true}
