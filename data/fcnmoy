{"id": "fcnmoy", "title": "Corona: Quick math on one year of -25% earnings", "selftext": "As a quick exercise in tragedy, let's assume that on average companies lose 25% of their revenue this year, but the economy is back to business as usual next year.  How much should a rational stock market fall?  Maybe a set of reasonable assumptions could help us come up with a number.\n\n1. Assume that PE rates will remain constant.\n2. Assume average 10% profit margin.\n3. Assume average 24% EPS growth.\n4. Assume terrible 25% loss of revenue for the year Corona virus hits\n5. Reminder that revenue is not the same as EPS (this is the death blow)\n\nThis is not meant to predict anything, but rather just to produce some numbers to stimulate discussion.\n\nSo, below is the EPS for a fictitious company with above stats, starting at year 1 with a EPS of $1.0.\n\n* Year 1  EPS: 1.0\n* Year 2 EPS: 1.24\n* Year 3  EPS: 1.54\n* Year 4 EPS: 1.90\n* Year 5 EPS: 2.36\n* Total earnings over 5 years: 8.04\n* Pretend stock price is 100, and calculate a PE based on average 5 year earnings.  100/(8.04/5) = 62 (we'll use this later)\n\nNow, let's pretend the Corona virus hits in year 3, and causes a 25% loss in revenue (not profit).  We need to figure out a new EPS for year 3.  To do that we need to figure out how much revenue was responsible for the 1.54 EPS.\n\nRevenue \\* 10% profit margin = 1.54 earnings.   Algebra says it was 15.4 dollars per share.  Losing 25% of this revenue means a loss of 3.85 per share.  So that year 3 EPS of 1.54 turns into (1.54-3.85= -2.31) negative 2.31 EPS for that year.  Ouch.  Now lets look at the new 5 year earnings for that company with the new numbers:\n\n* Year 1  EPS: 1.0\n* Year 2 EPS: 1.24\n* Year 3  EPS: -2.31\n* Year 4 EPS: 1.90\n* Year 5 EPS: 2.36\n* Total earnings over 5 years: 4.19\n* Assuming the PE over 5 years remains constant at 62, calculate the new price of the stock.  P = 62 \\* 4.19/5 = 52\n\nDid you get that?   One year of 25% lost revenue with constant PE would cause negative EPS for that year, and a loss in stock price of nearly 50% when averaged in with 5 years of normal earnings.\n\nPlease tell me how to modify this analysis to be more accurate.  Sure, if I averaged 10 years of earnings it would be less bad.  But it would still merit a far greater drop than 10% in the market.  As stands, I might want to liquidate all long positions to cash tomorrow morning.  Does the cash gang also get a gay rainbow?", "created_utc": 1583202394.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fcnmoy/corona_quick_math_on_one_year_of_25_earnings/", "is_self": true}
