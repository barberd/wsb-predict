{"id": "ebi5zd", "title": "Horses", "selftext": "Well I did some DD and it looks like buying and selling horses (and racehorse semen) might make you more money than leveraging your house on Robinhood or TD. \n\nMy DD comes from a few horse girls I talked to on Tinder and other matchmaking sites. One girl (aged 18) has made a whopping \u00a326k ($40k) profit in the last year by buying horses and then training them. She goes to school so imagine how much more she would have if she didnt waste her time there. Her dad has made over \u00a3200k in selling race horse semen to horsephiliacs. Withdraw your money and buy a horse for \u00a35k. Train it for a year and a half. Sell for \u00a314 to 20k online. \n\nEz money everytime.", "created_utc": 1576517335, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ebi5zd/horses/", "is_self": true}
