{"id": "fbapc1", "title": "Some deep thoughts about the beer virus", "selftext": "Experiencing the carnage this week was no easy feat and to switch positions to get tendies was not easy. I was thinking about the whole beer virus situation and have a series of what ifs for you guys to think about\n\nWhat if the beer virus was already spreading all over the world and the symptoms were so mild that it is confused with common cold. \n\nPeople were traveling without any restrictions until 1/24/2020. And every day at least 3 flights from China land in the San Francisco airport. So if the incubation period ranges from 14 to 27 days, then we are talking about several thousand people potentially bringing in the virus. And the population density in SF would take care of the rest. \n\nAnd if most people only felt mild symptoms then, they could have chalked it to jet lag and people from China may experience jet lag for 10 to 12 days. And thanks to the messed up health care system, people tend to seek NyQuil to deal with their symptoms. If it was a mild infection, then it would probably be already gone with the basic medication that they never felt the need to wear masks, quarantine themselves or feel the panic. \n\nWhat if the population in the countries where flu shots are commonly administered are less likely to get severe cases. If that is true, then most of the US population may feel mild symptoms and will be ok in 2 to 4 weeks and this could have already happened. \n\nI am not denying that this is a nasty bug and I am not trivializing the fact that many have died fighting this virus. All I am saying is that we do not know a lot about the covid and the markets may be oversold and it is time to buy some damn calls.", "created_utc": 1582971981, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fbapc1/some_deep_thoughts_about_the_beer_virus/", "is_self": true}
