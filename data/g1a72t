{"id": "g1a72t", "title": "FANG: The opportunity to gain 500% or lose all your money.", "selftext": "So I took a cursory look at FANG (Diamondback Energy) before I bought some wildly OTM LEAP calls, here's what I found.\n\n1. They currently do not have enough current assets (869 mil) to service their short term liabilities (1.263 bil). That said, their overall liabilities to assets ratio is very favourable (3:1) so I believe that with QE assuaging the worst of the liquidity crisis, they should be able to raise additional debt to service these short term liabilities. I also believe that is priced in their stock.\n\n2. Their break even price per barrel is about 24.70 USD. With this being a presidential election year, I fully believe Trump will buoy oil prices by every means at his disposal given that the O&G industry is central to Texas Republicans. With the demand crunch slowly assuaging over late 2020-early 2021, we should start to see normal oil prices in late 2021.\n\n3. With a 52 wk low at 14.55 and a 52 wk high at 114.14, the stock seems to have plenty of room to grow with a current price of  31.80, once the underlying commodity rallies.\n\n4. Despite having generally low volume on options, the Jan 2022 call has roughly 15k open interest, which seems to indicate that these might be liquid enough to trade. Watch out for the spread though, it's pretty brutal.\n\nPositions: GOLD 1/15/2021 20c, SPY 4/17 250p, SPY 6/19 200p, USO 1/15/2021 5c, FANG 1/21/2022 100c", "created_utc": 1586886430.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1a72t/fang_the_opportunity_to_gain_500_or_lose_all_your/", "is_self": true}
