What an actual load of horse shit. Just like with Iran a few months ago. There was a minor sell off every week and it was because of \u201cfears over Iran\u201d. But then the market would be back up to all time highs. These news sources try to explain market volatility in the most clickbait ways possible. I get that the corona virus is temporarily affecting profit speculation and some production but the market has bigger issues such as the inverting yield curve, outrageously high PE ratios, overbought market as a whole, illiquid funds from investors, and potential for an interest hike.", "created_utc": 1582732870, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9vd2g/im_glad_the_corona_virus_is_nothing_to_worry/", "is_self": true}
