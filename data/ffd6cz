The Saudis say they can pump as much as 12.5 million barrels a day.\n\n*- Aramco slashed its official selling price for flagship Arab Light crude to buyers in Asia by $6 a barrel, to a discount of $3.10 below the Middle East benchmark. The cuts eclipsed the $1.90 reduction expected by traders and refiners. It also reduced Medium crude to Asia by $6 a barrel, dropping the grade to a $4.05 discount, according to the company\u2019s pricing sheet.* ***(VERY IMPORTANT)***\n\n***Looking into the future:***\n\n***We are about to enter an OIL glut:***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xq3wldkxngl41.png?width=753&format=png&auto=webp&s=03365a3125a374059dcea1f5cb50a6c13b0fde49\n\nSo now let's look at some charts and some resistance and support levels for Crude:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Crude Oil Monthly Chart](https://preview.redd.it/sfm77hwqjgl41.png?width=1564&format=png&auto=webp&s=70257980916fd62d6fbfa0c7db5e40f6f891459e)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs you can see on the monthly chart, oversold conditions haven't been encountered in over 5 years. Since our large sell off and we are approaching the $30/Barrel price. I expect the price to dip below 30 to $20-$25 before support can be found. (This is news dependent as things could change).\n\nOur Next Support is $20 Dollars\n\nLook for Puts in /CL Futures which provide a good cheap way to enter options contracts or any stocks ETF's ETNS or banks that are oil heavy in portfolio.\n\nThe coronavirus will shut down major cruise ships and airplane travel also pushing prices down.\n\n \n\nPOSITON: 10 Put Contracts APRIL 20th 2020 30 STRIKE\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/dnoMTOj.png](https://i.imgur.com/dnoMTOj.png)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6muk9f9dkgl41.png?width=1250&format=png&auto=webp&s=b905ceae0471b664d637bb0f6164afcaae82e7aa", "created_utc": 1583677454.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffd6cz/oil_crash_of_2020_dd/", "is_self": true}
