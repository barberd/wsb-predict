{"id": "cugwnc", "title": "$TGT and $WMT Pump and Dump", "selftext": "Immediately after earning reports released, $TGT and $WMT shares surged in price, with Target going over 20%. Why? Banks and investors are pumping the shit out of the stock getting ready for a big dump in the upcoming months. Everyone including their moms freaked out about the 10% tariffs on September 1st on $300billion worth of Chinese imports, with Tim Apple having a personal meeting with Mango Man. As a result, mango man delayed tariffs until December 15th and the market became bullish. \n\nWith that said, retailers like WMT, TGT, DLTR, and DG all stock goods from Chinese factories. During Targets earnings report, there were no questions about Chinese tariffs in the upcoming future so investors could pump the stock. However, companies like DKS (Dicks) were railed with questions about impending tariffs. \n\nCurrently, the trading volume for all 4 stocks are significantly lower than previous volumes. My guess is that investors are waiting for Trump's tweet to put into effect September 1st tariffs in retaliation to China's $75 Billion worth of tariffs that was announced in the morning. Also, there are always corrections after earnings reports and $TGT's $104 share is not priced in. \n\nLooking at the list from the USTR, there are a FUCK TON of goods like clothing, meats, baby products and raw materials like cotton and plastics that are impending a 10% tariff. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI bought puts for $TGT specifically because the 20% growth won't last long. So buckle up and lets wait for MANGO MAN to tweet his next line of bullshit to tank the market for the second time today!\n\n[https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/enforcement/301Investigations/List\\_4A\\_%28Effective\\_September\\_1%2C\\_2019%29.pdf](https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/enforcement/301Investigations/List_4A_%28Effective_September_1%2C_2019%29.pdf)", "created_utc": 1566580760, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cugwnc/tgt_and_wmt_pump_and_dump/", "is_self": true}
