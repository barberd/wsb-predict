Currently trading at 91 cents Canadian under the symbol $LGX.v and 68 cents USD under the symbol $LXXGF. As seen with the run up in $CODX from under a dollar in late December to $21.75 on Fridays trading. Once the market catches onto LexaGene, the share price will take off. This company offers a quick diagnosis of the virus and makes it easy for health care professionals to isolate the person immediately with having confirmation within an hour. \n\n\" **LexaGene\u2019s LX Analyzer Successfully Detects Coronavirus RNA using the CDC\u2019s Tests** \"\n\n\" The LX Analyzer delivers excellent sensitivity, specificity, and breadth of detection and **can return results in about 1 hour**. \"\n\n[https://ceo.ca/@nasdaq/lexagenes-lx-analyzer-successfully-detects-coronavirus](https://ceo.ca/@nasdaq/lexagenes-lx-analyzer-successfully-detects-coronavirus) \n\nDr. Jack Regan, LexaGene\u2019s CEO and founder, says the company\u2019s genetic analyzer can detect new pathogens such as the coronavirus in \u201cjust one hour, on-site\u201d.\n\n\u201cCurrently the traditional process requires that samples from sick individuals must be transported to laboratories for manual processing,\u201d Regan said. \u201cThis is extremely inefficient and introduces a significant time-delay that can have severe consequences for disease spread. Today\u2019s coronavirus outbreak highlights why LexaGene\u2019s technology is needed so desperately.\u201d\n\n\u201cCurrently, no technology exists that allows for these locations to readily start screening for a new threat within days of an outbreak being identified,\u201d Regan continued. **\u201cLexaGene is addressing this urgent problem and has developed the first ever, easy-to-use, open-access diagnostic analyzer that is designed to help control the spread of deadly outbreaks such as this 2019 coronavirus.\u201d** \n\n[https://ca.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/911564/lexagene-bombarded-with-inquiries-about-pathogen-detection-platform-for-coronavirus-identification-use-911564.html](https://ca.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/911564/lexagene-bombarded-with-inquiries-about-pathogen-detection-platform-for-coronavirus-identification-use-911564.html) \n\n\u201cWith a traditional reference lab, by the time a clinic takes a sample and ships it off, you\u2019ve lost 12 to 24 hours,\u201d said Dr. Jack Regan, the chief executive of LexaGene, a Massachusetts company that hopes to sell its coffee maker-size instrument to airports, schools and clinics. \u201cWe can get results in under an hour, which makes a huge difference during deadly outbreaks.\u201d \n\n\" A wider rollout of these tests faces a number of hurdles. Most of the tests identify a patient\u2019s infection 80 to 90 percent of the time \u2014 regulators would like that figure to be closer to 100 percent \u2014 and many of them are still awaiting a green light from the F.D.A. But health experts say a larger impediment to their widespread use is economics: **Most of the tests run $500 to $3,000** (the test used to diagnose Mr. Springer was $2,000) and because few private insurances companies cover them, the costs are largely borne by hospitals or patients. \"\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/24/health/genomic-diagnostic-tests.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/24/health/genomic-diagnostic-tests.html)", "created_utc": 1583093292, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fbzrl8/very_undervalued_coronavirus_testing_company_lxgv/", "is_self": true}
