Recession is here and that means the best stocks you want to hold in your portfolio are those that move **inversely** to the market.\n\nWhich ones are those?  Well I did my homework for you retards:\n\n1. ZM.  This company has top-line revenue growth of 115%+/year (geometric average) over the last 3 years. The phenomenal growth rate ranks in the top 5% percentile of all companies.  This is also not even including the most recent quarter, which I'm sure blow by expectations because of the shift to online communication platforms.  I work in academia and I know that 80%+ of academic institutions are using Zoom on a regular basis due to lockdown.  Sure there are privacy and security concerns with the software but the widespread adoption of this technology will far outweigh these problems.  The stock price is trading at only 35% over the highs before the crisis so if we take into account the recent surge, there\u2019s upside value. \nMost importantly, ZM has no long-term debt and positive free cash flow to equity already, even though it is a relatively new publicly traded company.  Usually, companies in rapid growth phase have negative FCFE (i.e., NFLX).  Six-month price target: $175\n2. REGN. Revenue growth is at 22%/year over the last 5 years.  EPS growth of 43%/year.  No long-term debt.  Positive FCFE in the each of the last 5 years.  This stock was a winner before the lockdown.  They are one of the top companies currently working on a rona vaccine.  My personal favorite healthcare stock at this time.  Six-month price target: $650\n3. AMZN. This stock has only increased by 10-15% since before lockdown.  It's so rare to see a $1.1 trillion market cap stock that is still growing revenues by 24%/year.  Their purchase of Whole Foods turned out to be strategically sound.  FCFE/share has increased from 11 --&amp;gt; 27 --&amp;gt; 40 in the last 3 years.  Sky's the limit.  I mean fuck, you can tell how well they are doing because they are hiring 175,000 people during these times.  They report their earnings in 10 days and I expect to see them smash it.\n4. TDOC. Interesting stock that someone else here mentioned.  They have 64%/year revenue growth in the last 4 years but negative FCFE in each of those years.  They are still ramping up but I do believe in the quick adoption of tele-medicine in the near future.  Doctors and patients no longer want to see face to face.", "created_utc": 1586811706.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0rk0n/listen_up_you_fucks_recessionproof_stocks_are_the/", "is_self": true}
