{"id": "g50itt", "title": "DD: Massive Gains on $FLIR today and more to come!", "selftext": "What's up, cucks?\n\nSo my prediction was correct and FLIR went up bigly today, even more than I had expected. \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2t1b1/dd_flir_thermal_cameras_watch_this_one_go_up_bigly/\n](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2t1b1/dd_flir_thermal_cameras_watch_this_one_go_up_bigly/)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI was sitting on 17 5/15 $40 calls that I sold for 200% profit. If I had held I would have made an extra 160%! Instead, I panic sold and then immediately rolled over to 7/17 $55 calls. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'll summarize my DD for you retards with attention spans shorter than Donnie's micro-penis. So don't fucking debate me and go \"Buh-buh FLIR is too expensive, It wasn't made for human temperature monitoring wahhhhh\" until you actually understand my reasoning:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* THIS DOES NOT DETECT CORONAVIRUS and a lot of people are actually asymptomatic meaning no fever\n* Instead, thermal imaging is a first line of defense that can allow companies to easily and rapidly monitor for elevated body temperature from a safe distance.\n* Business, governments, and people want to get the fuck back to work and this is a tool that can add some sense of security, even if false. It's part of a broader solution to get us back to some sense of normalcy.\n* Even if this expensive, $11k is literally nothing for big businesses that stand to lose more than 10x that every day they aren't operating\n* No, your cheap Chinese crap, with spyware and gimped specs for Americans, will not be fucking contracted by LAX and JFK. Look how well relying on china to provide our PPE and essential equipment turned out for us and Europe last month\n* I can see it being part of national security to not have our vital industries rely on Chinese shit. So Raytheon, Lockheed, and Boeing will legally not be allowed to have chinese or foreign thermal imaging equipment in their facilities. On top of public infrastructure like airports.\n* Lastly, other thermal imaging companies rely on sensors from FLIR and Lynred (which is shut down btw). SO even if they aren't buying FLIR cameras, they are still benefitting from the sensor sales. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAlso new DD here for those of you who are beyond a 6th-grade reading level: https://imgur.com/gallery/1o0h1rq\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'll be honest. The largest gain-train had left the station at 3:59 PM last Friday. Too bad for those of you who didn't read my DD. There are still some gains to be made but not anywhere near 360%, sorry. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nAlso Mods, Please ban [u/awildianappears \n](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2t1b1/dd_flir_thermal_cameras_watch_this_one_go_up_bigly/fnso661/)per his request as he was completely wrong.", "created_utc": 1587414416.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g50itt/dd_massive_gains_on_flir_today_and_more_to_come/", "is_self": true}
