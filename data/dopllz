Underlying optimism that the U.S. and China are reportedly on track with trade deal progress has helped sentiment. On a related note, the USTR said it is considering extending tariff exemptions on $34 billion of imported Chinese goods that would go into effect Dec. 28. Separately, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said she expects growth in Hong Kong to be negative in 2019. Tokyo's core CPI came in softer than expected in October, with the effects of the sales tax hike garnering some attribution for the weakness.\n\n* In economic data:\n   * South Korea's November Manufacturing BSI Index 74 (last 73)\n   * Tokyo October CPI +0.4% yr/yr (last +0.4%); Tokyo core CPI +0.5% yr/yr (expected +0.7%; last +0.5%)\n\n\\---Equity Markets---\n\n* **Japan's Nikkei:** \\+0.5%\n* **Hong Kong's Hang Seng:** \\-0.4%\n* **China's Shanghai Composite:** \\-0.9%\n* **India's Sensex:** \\+1.5%\n* **South Korea's Kospi:** \\-0.04%\n* **Australia's ASX All Ordinaries:** \\+0.1%\n\n\\---FX---\n\n* USD/JPY: unch at 108.92\n* USD/CNH: -0.03% to 7.0624\n* USD/INR: +0.2% to 70.898\n\n**Europe**: DAX -0.2%, FTSE -0.9%, CAC -0.1%\n\nMajor European indices are experiencing modest losses, as buyers have been a reluctant bunch in today's trading action. Earnings news has failed to whet their appetite, with oil giant BP and packaging firm Stora Enso among the luminaries weighing on the bourses after reporting results that failed to please investors. The Brexit saga continues with recent news that the Labour Party is now willing to support a Dec. 12 general election knowing that a no-deal Brexit isn't in the cards for three months after the EU confirmed an Article 50 extension until January 31. The British pound had been weaker earlier, but has gained some ground following the report.\n\n* In economic data:\n   * UK's October Nationwide HPI +0.2% m/m (last -0.2%); +0.4% yr/yr (expected +0.2%; last +0.2%); BoE September Consumer Credit GBP0.828B (expected GBP0.88B; last GBP 0.969B)\n   * France's October Consumer Confidence 104 (expected 104; last 104)\n   * Spain's September Retail Sales +0.1% m/m (expected +0.5%; last +0.2%); +3.4% yr/yr (expected +3.2%; last +3.3%)\n   * Italy's September PPI +0.1% m/m (expected -0.1%; last -0.4%); -1.7% yr/yr (expected -0.9%; last -1.4%)\n\n\\---Equity Markets---\n\n* **STOXX Europe 600:** \\-0.4%\n* **Germany's DAX:** \\-0.2%\n* **U.K.'s FTSE 100:** \\-0.9%\n* **France's CAC 40:** \\-0.1%\n* **Italy's FTSE MIB:** \\-0.1%\n* **Spain's IBEX 35:** \\-0.5%\n\n\\---FX---\n\n* EUR/USD: -0.2% to 1.1080\n* GBP/USD: +0.03% to 1.2864\n* USD/CHF: +0.1% to 0.9956\n\n**DISCLAIMER: ALL CONTENT COURTESY OF** [**ATOM FINANCE**](https://atom.finance)**!**", "created_utc": 1572354702, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dopllz/morning_briefing_10292019/", "is_self": true}
