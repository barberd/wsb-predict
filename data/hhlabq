{"id": "hhlabq", "title": "Tech is not overvalued - a rebuttal", "selftext": "Yesterday, some boomer who works as a 'consultant' made a post titled '[Tech is not overvalued](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hgypxy/tech_is_not_a_overvalued/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)'.\n\nHe included a picture of a cloud (cute) with the names of a bunch of companies inside (I guess boomers still get hard over 'Cloud Based Solutions'). I was curious, so I started looking up these companies.\n\nHere is the first 6 of those companies, along with a quick description of what they do, and an Open Source / cheaper alternative, or my take on why they are overvalued.\n\nI think it's telling that for 50% of these companies, the first suggestion Google gives after typing in the name is \"share price\".\n\n**8x8**\n\n* Voice or IP. i.e. they let you call people, but using the internet.\n* QTox\n\n**Alteryx**\n\n* Data Visualization\n* Python (Matplotlib etc.)\n\n**Anaplan**  \nTook 4 months moving another companies spreadsheets 'into the cloud'. I wonder how much they were paid during those 4 months. Worked with MUFG to speed up carried interest calculations. Used to take 4 hours. Now takes 30 minutes after 'automating' some things. I would love to know what calculations they need to do that makes it take so long in the first place.\n\n* 'Planning and Modeling Applications'\n* ~~Hire competent people.~~ This a consultancy company, not a software company.\n\n**Appfolio**\n\n* Property management 'app'.\n* ~~Kill all landlords.~~ This is not a tech company, this is a management/consultancy company.\n\n**Atlassian**  \nThis is the company that makes Trello. They also have a podcast called \"Teamistry\", which I think is fitting. The kind of person who uses Trello is the same kind of person who thinks \"Teamistry\" is a funny pun.\n\n* Project Collaboration software\n* ~~Learn to use git properly you baby back bitch.~~ Git + Emails.\n\n**AutoDesk**  \nComputer aided design (CAD) software is like photo editing software, but for 3D. AutoDesk makes AutoCad + other CAD stuff.\n\n* CAD software.\n* FreeCAD.\n\n**Avalara**  \nThis company is supposed to help automate taxes, but isn't the point of the complicated tax code to make it easier to hide loopholes and contradictions. Then you hire an account to help you exploit those loopholes. If this software automagically does that, then that's pretty cool. RIP accountants.\n\n* Accounting/Tax software\n* GNUCash? Maybe. Or just hire an accountant, depending on pricing.\n\nWould be great is someone could add to this with your own industry knowlegde. Have you heard of any of the companies in the original post? Do you use any of the software or do you know of any alternatives?", "created_utc": 1593374496.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hhlabq/tech_is_not_overvalued_a_rebuttal/", "is_self": true}
