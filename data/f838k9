{"id": "f838k9", "title": "Weekend DD", "selftext": "Ok here is some DD on a stock i\u2019ve been watching for a while. AMA about this sick DD on $AMC.\n\n$AMC is primed for a $SPCE style explosion \ud83d\ude80 :\n\nThe float is more than 50% short going into earnings this coming Thursday. Expectations are low as fuck because there is this narrative that no one goes to the movies anymore due to streaming. That\u2019s false. A-list has over 900,000 subscribers and Stubs over 20 million households. The box office is a $10+ billion dollar industry per year, and the studios have a vested interest in keeping AMC in good shape. (There has been talk about Adam Aron making some more favorable ticket deals with DIS. See business insider article for that DD.)\n\nAnyway, the current book value of AMC is over $13 while the stock is at $7.50. How? Because of their debt and capex. But their capex will be way down now that all of their theaters have been redone. The debt is also getting paid off as we speak and is way better than it looks.  Why you may ask?? \n\nBecause new accounting rules mean future lease obligations must be taken into account in the debt load. This is unfair to companies with many lease obligations like $AMC because it makes future lease obligations look like more debt. If you have 2 mos. left on your lease at $1k per month, would you say you\u2019re $2k in debt? No thats retarded.\n\nExpansion abroad is also ignored...U.S box office hasnt been as explosive this and last year, but Saudi Arabia \ud83d\udc2a is a massive emerging market that AMC is breaking into. Also, keep in mind that the box office is cyclical. End of 2019 and 2020 will be the biggest box office of all time.\n\n\nhttps://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-amc-saudi-arabia-20180404-story.html\n\nThis stock is so slept on the short silly \ud83d\udc3b s are going to have to pay its ridiculous dividend, leading to a squeeze.\n\nTL;DR: AMC calls dont sleep on this", "created_utc": 1582425265, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f838k9/weekend_dd/", "is_self": true}
