They were looking GREAT pre-market. I had a limit set to $10 (originally purchased at 3.59). I was confident we were mooning at open! And then... the highest they reached were $4 then it was downhill from there.\n\nApparently I only have diamond hands when I\u2019m losing money? \n\nA Merrill rep left several panicked voice mails. I tried to call back and was put on hold for 30min. I thought, well, maybe it\u2019s time to let these turds go and hung up.\n\nI sold them back for ~$2500 (I haven\u2019t actually done the math) about 1.5 hours before close. Never got that pump I thought we would! Here\u2019s the sell orders for them. Beware that losses don\u2019t look cool outside of RH.\n\n[sell orders](https://imgur.com/a/OuBTldN) Easter egg! \n\nI also had a bunch of $270\u2019s that ended up nearly worthless.\n\nImportant notes:\n\n1. These wiped out all my gains for the week. Still up over two weeks.\n\n2. Yesterday I sold my 4/17 $220\u2019s with the plan to buy a June strike once the market pumped. I bought 50 SPY June 220\u2019s when it hit 236. Those closed up $10k.\n\n3. Don\u2019t listen to anyone on WSB and also listen to everyone on WSB. Someone is right sometimes.\n\n4. During the charity drive, u/wallstreetbooyah mentioned there wasn\u2019t enough loss porn lately. Ask and you shall receive!\n\n5. Folks, most importantly, make sure to keep your mental health in check and play with money you can lose. No need to go broke when you need the money the most. Times are about to get tough for a lot of people. No need take unnecessary risks if you are out of work.\n\nTake care of yourselves! Monday will be yugely geeen since I bought puts again!", "created_utc": 1584738686.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fm2upp/witching_hour_was_actually_a_bear_gangbang_35k/", "is_self": true}
