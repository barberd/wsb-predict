I loaded up on toilet paper, peanut butter, water, and canned food.\n\nThis place is out of everything.  \n\nI\u2019ve never seen so many middle aged soccer moms fighting over top ramen noodles in my life.  \n\nAnyway, I spoke with a guy who worked there.  He had a massive pile of cardboard on his cart.\n\nAnyway, he told me they did $400,000 in sales yesterday.  And have all been given clearance for overtime.  I believed him on the overtime, guy smelled like swamp ass.\n\nBut that swampass also smelled a lot like tendies too.", "created_utc": 1583111728, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fc466b/i_did_some_dd_on_walmart_today/", "is_self": true}
