{"id": "ckatkv", "title": "BYND updated borrow costs from S3", "selftext": "From S3: BYND short int is $1.02 billion; 5.25 million shares shorted; 44.59% of float; 126% borrow fee on existing shorts but new small borrows going at 250% to 475% fee, We saw 41k of net short selling yesterday as [\\#BeyondMeat](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BeyondMeat?src=hashtag_click)'s stock price fell -12.32%. Secondary hasn't happened yet,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is their article from yesterday discussing the secondary and why they think a short squeeze is still on deck:\n\n[https://shortsight.com/beyond-meat-shorts-up-170-million-on-secondary-offering-news-2/](https://shortsight.com/beyond-meat-shorts-up-170-million-on-secondary-offering-news-2/)\n\nBeyond Meat Inc (BYND) reported mixed 2nd Quarter results with earnings of -$0.24/share, missing expectations, but Sales of $67.3 million beating expectations. The biggest news on the call was the announcement of a secondary offering of 3 million shares from existing investors and 250 thousand shares from the company. BYND investors will be able to cash in on the company\u2019s nearly fourfold rise in its stock price ahead of their November lockup period expiration and Beyond Meat Inc. will be able to raise cash for operational purposes.\n\nBYND short interest is $1.16 billion; 5.21 million shares shorted; 44.45% of its float; 138% borrow fee on existing shorts and new stock borrows are going between 160% to 240% fee.\n\nBYND short selling has been hampered by lack of stock borrow supply since the end of May. While short selling has increased slightly since the beginning of June, an increase of 55 thousand shares +1.07%, we have seen 179 thousand shares covered, -3.33%, over the last week. Most of the short selling has been forced due to a slew of stock loan recalls hitting the street over the last two weeks, but there has also been voluntary short covering due to the high cost of borrow eating into trader\u2019s alpha and the nearly $1 billion of mark-to-market losses incurred by short sellers since BYND\u2019s IPO.\n\nBYND short sellers were down $970 million in mark-to-market losses since its IPO, and down $441 million in July. BYND\u2019s stock price was down significantly in after-market trading after the secondary offering news and the price weakness carried through to today\u2019s market open. BYND is down -14.5% in early morning trading and shorts have recouped $167 million in mark-to-market profits in less than 15 minutes of trading. Shorts are now down \u201conly\u201d -$803 million in mark-to-market year-to-date losses and down -$185 million in month-to-date losses.\n\nA BYND short squeeze is still looming on the horizon, shorts are paying over $4.4 million in daily stock borrow financing costs; stock borrow rates continue getting more expensive; stock loan recalls keep hitting the streets; there is virtually no stock borrow supply left on the street to cover those recalls; and shorts are still down a significant amount of mark-to-market losses even with today\u2019s price drop.\n\nBYND is still a Tesla-like lifestyle based long stock holding and therefore we are less likely to see long shareholder capitulation on price pullbacks which would shift BYND\u2019s price momentum downward. A rebound rally back to its yearly highs will probably shake out some more short sellers who caught a temporary respite from seemingly daily losses and provide some buy-side pressure. If BYND\u2019s stock price rebounds it will force some short covering as shorts realize some of today\u2019s profits before they disappear into thin air. If long shareholders decide to buy on the dip and build their positions at today\u2019s \u201ccheap\u201d prices, short sellers may decide to cut their losses and buy back shares now and possibly wait until the 3.25 million share secondary offering hits the tape to re-establish their positions.\n\nThere are many reasons for an impending BYND short squeeze, but only a complete 180 degree change in long shareholder sentiment will save BYND short sellers\u2019 year-to-date P\\\\L. If today\u2019s price weakness doesn\u2019t hold, look for long buying coupled with short covering driving BYND\u2019s stock price back to its recent lofty heights.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe again- I think the earnings' figures were pretty spectacular. They didn't miss EPS when you exclude the warrant revaluation from having the stock go from $25 to $200, but that doesn't matter since the stock is down. Obviously revenue and guidance blew the roof off both estimates. I'm curious how this will trade after the secondary prices tonight. Will borrow costs come down below 100%? If so, its probably dead in the water. However, if it doesn't, shorts are sitting on high borrow costs while they wait 3 months for 3Q earnings. I am trapped in $300calls for August 16th that are super out of the money. There isn't enough volume to sell them if I wanted, so I have no choice but to be long here :) I sold a small bit of my position on Monday before earnings (the post was taken down due to downvotes? Good system we have here at WSB). So I am sitting on a 30x bagger that I've cashed out. But I am definitely hoping I can recoup something for the massive amount of calls that are presently almost worthless.", "created_utc": 1564590813, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ckatkv/bynd_updated_borrow_costs_from_s3/", "is_self": true}
