No one wants America to collapse. Even the people who print your money have made it as clear as can that they will do everything in power to support markets. \n\nSure, a 1/1'000'000'000 steak in AMD isn't really worth $40 - but who cares? I've see way more people losing money on puts than on calls - so if you're gunna buy puts, at least stay within your Personal Risk Tolerance.\n\nDon't be pussy.
