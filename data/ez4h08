You think \u201cshit I lost 1k today\u201d or \u201cI could have made many thousands\u201d but that doesn\u2019t matter as long as you live to yolo another day. The cucks at investing will say shit about taxes and long term gains but they know nothing of strippers a Peruvian marching powder. Remember; don\u2019t bet more than you can lose and that big bank takes little bank.
