{"id": "fhhwlg", "title": "WWE still has plenty of room to drop (Why the XFL is gonna RIP)", "selftext": "TLDR: WWE $30p 3/20\n\nWWE as far as I know is the only publicly traded sports league. Not only does it have its Super Bowl equivalent, Wrestlemania, in April. Not only is it underwhelming its new TV deal...\n\nIt also has its newly-founded XFL. I think people don't realize how much corona could hurt the XFL. If the MLB, NBA, and NCAA (and maybe NHL soon) are all cancelling games/seasons, I think the XFL will have to follow suit. Since the XFL brand is not an established one, it has more to lose. Also, the XFL schedule was specifically designed to fill in this lull in American sports that happens in February and March, but that schedule is going to be fucked either way. Also, since there are only 8 teams in the league, there is more exposure than a 32 team league has.\n\nGuess where some of the 8 teams are? NY = lots of cases, Seattle = lots of cases, LA = cases, Texas = cases, Tampa = cases, DC = cases, maybe St Louis is safe idk. Has this all been priced-in? I do not think so.\n\nBut yeah, WWE $30p 3/20 (and 4/17 if you less of a degen)\n\nEDIT 1: I guess Alpha (XFL) and WWE are technically separate, but McMahon is McMahon, and the public/investors are going to link the two. I think it is just as credible a link as puts on MSG secondary to NBA suspension, or something like that. But, fade this read if you want, IDC. Wrestlemania is probably half-priced in, so even if XFL has no impact (which I still think it will), I think WWE bottom is still lower.  \n\n\nEDIT 2: Smackdown was cancelled this for tomorrow. Currently meeting in Tampa to decide Wrestlemania's fate.", "created_utc": 1584026267.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhhwlg/wwe_still_has_plenty_of_room_to_drop_why_the_xfl/", "is_self": true}
