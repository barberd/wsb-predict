{"id": "dffqs2", "title": "The effects of trading options on women (NSFW)", "selftext": "This is a clearly true story that happened in real life not made up to troll. So I was strolling through the supermarket picking up my usual twinkies, fried chicken, and donuts since I naturally have the body of a Greek god due to FD\u2019s generating 10x returns per usual and raising my testosterone to god tier levels. My only workouts consist of swiping up to lock in my Robinhood trades, and then repeatedly swiping up until I finally get filled. I was checking out and I heard some guy talking to his wife about the sweet, sweet $AMZN shares he just spent his life savings on, but the whole time she was looking at me as she saw me pull out my newly acquired Robinhood debit card. You could tell that she just knew I had autism, and she knew I was raking in the tendies. Her husband said his card was denied, and she said she was going back to the car to get her card. She gave me a quick look that said it all, she wanted my 9 $IN P to go deep ITP, I mean ITM. I quickly followed her out and ravaged her in her husband\u2019s Toyota Prius with a Bernie 2020 sticker on the back bumper. She told me to talk dirty to her so I told her I lost my entire life savings on $TSLA 420 C\u2019s. She moaned and told me to $NUT inside her, but being the respectable honorable man I am, I knew her husband could not afford my chad spawn with all his assets tied up in Ally savings accounts and mutual funds, so I pulled out and released on her $JNUG\u2019s. She asked me to run away with her and leave her husband behind, so I had to be quick and think of an excuse. Luckily the gods were watching out for me, and I got a phone call, it was Robinhood letting me know I owed $100k on a margin call and that if I didn\u2019t pay by the end of the day, my account would be closed, and my debt would be pursued. I laughed as I deleted the app, signed up for a new account in the wife\u2019s name, had her cleared to trade options. I told her I could turn her life savings into 1 million in a month and that\u2019d I\u2019d return. I left the car a champion, ready to trade FD\u2019s, and ready to pursue my destiny.
