Europe detail:**\n\n**Asia**: Nikkei +0.3%, Hang Seng -0.8%, Shanghai -0.4%\n\nEquity indices in the Asia-Pacific region turned in some generally underwhelming performances on Wednesday, as the disappointing earnings report and outlook from Texas Instruments and the swirl of uncertainty surrounding Brexit left buyers in a guarded mood. There was also a lack of meaningful economic data to stir things up. In news, Beijing is reportedly looking into replacing Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, the IMF said growth in Asia in 2019 could slip to 5.0% from its prior forecast of 5.4%, and China, according to *Bloomberg*, is granting more waivers for buyers to step up purchases of U.S. soybeans.\n\n* In economic data:\n   * Singapore September CPI +0.5% yr/yr (expected 0.5%; last 0.5%)\n\n\\---Equity Markets---\n\n* **Japan's Nikkei:** \\+0.3%\n* **Hong Kong's Hang Seng:** \\-0.8%\n* **China's Shanghai Composite:** \\-0.4%\n* **India's Sensex:** \\+0.2%\n* **South Korea's Kospi:** \\-0.4%\n* **Australia's ASX All Ordinaries:** unch\n\n\\---FX---\n\n* USD/JPY: UNCH at 108.46\n* USD/CNH: -0.04% to 7.0744\n* USD/INR: +0.2% to 70.94\n\n**Europe**: DAX +0.1%, FTSE +0.3%, CAC -0.6%\n\nMajor European indices have followed suit with their Asian counterparts and have thus far delivered an underwhelming performance. The drama surrounding the timeline for Brexit has kept investor conviction in check, along with an earnings warning out of Heineken. Disappointing quarterly results and guidance from both Texas Instruments and Caterpillar has the futures market presaging a negative start for the U.S. stock market, which has been another drag on sentiment. The euro and the British pound are both down 0.1% against the dollar.\n\n* In economic data:\n   * France's October Business Survey 99\u00a0(expected 102; last 102)\n\n\\---Equity Markets---\n\n* **STOXX Europe 600:** \\-0.3%\n* **Germany's DAX:** \\+0.1%\n* **U.K.'s FTSE 100:** \\+0.3%\n* **France's CAC 40:** \\-0.6%\n* **Italy's FTSE MIB:** \\-0.7%\n* **Spain's IBEX 35:** \\-0.2%\n\n\\---FX---\n\n* EUR/USD: -0.1% to 1.1110\n* GBP/USD: -0.1% to 1.2863\n* USD/CHF: +0.1% to 0.9898\n\n**DISCLAIMER: ALL CONTENT COURTESY OF** [**ATOM FINANCE**](https://atom.finance)**!**", "created_utc": 1571839441, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dlzru0/morning_briefing_10232019/", "is_self": true}
