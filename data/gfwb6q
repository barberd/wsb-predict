{"id": "gfwb6q", "title": "$STON funeral home / cemetery owner and operator", "selftext": "StoneMor Partners NYSE: STON is a owner and operator of funeral homes and cemeteries.  A few years back it was a high dividend yield company paying upwards of 10% until piss poor management and debt burden caused them to halt their dividend.  Now they are a penny stock trading a around $.50.  Their CEO has been quoted as saying they are \u201csolvent enough\u201d to make it through the corona crises.  Although the funeral home business has not done well during social distancing protocols the burial plot business has seen a spike in demand due to covid deaths.  As we start to ease out of social distancing the funeral business should see a slight recovery and people who missed the opportunity to have a traditional service may elect to do so.  Also with speculation of a second wave in the fall the burial plot/ crematorium business should remain strong until a vaccine is fully distributed.  IMO At .50 a share this thing is worth a bet.  I also added $2.50 October calls  the other day for around .12.  In conclusion with stocks and deaths trending up to ATH $STON looks like a solid penny stock to bet on.", "created_utc": 1588955273.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gfwb6q/ston_funeral_home_cemetery_owner_and_operator/", "is_self": true}
