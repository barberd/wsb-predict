Any number below 5M is just not realistic. The joblessness claims numbers are going to break 5.5 million.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Iftu0ShgsMD74uWLVXcuY75h2o_YY4bD7cZnhHPrJK8/edit?usp=drivesdk\n\nI've spent the last week tracking down local news coverage of governors and state officials letting the upcoming jobless claims numbers slip into their press briefings. I've gotten actual numbers for 16 states. These jobless numbers are anywhere from 5.2M to 7M... this week. Any estimate below 5M is just lazy fucking guessing. \n\nThe best state number is Minnesota, with only a 3% increase from the previous week. Hawaii is the worst, with an 1100% increase (although that's an outlier). Many states will be near or exceed a 500% increase (AL, CA, CT, CO). I'm estimating (on the low side) that CA is about to report 1.1M losses.\n\nGoing through the other states news reports where i couldn't get a hard claims number, most are still reporting people are completely unable to get through (meaning many will still be unaccounted for this week). Most states are increasing employment of their unemployment claims officers by anywhere from 30% to 2x (I've forgotten which ones, I didn't save those links).\n\nEstimating the other 34 states, if i live in fucking dream land where everything is rosy and the world isn't on fire, I could say a 20% increase from the previous weeks numbers is fair. On the high end maybe its a 300% increase (very unlikely on all 34 states)\n\nOhio, Texas, Massachusetts, and some others are particularly large wild cards in my estimates.\n\nThis gives a range of 5.2M on the low and 7.8M on the high end.... Now... These numbers may include revisions to the previous week. So what I'm saying is, if the reported number this week is 4.2M, then i expect revisions to the previous report to account for that missing million. But overall, newly reported losses will be  anywhere from 5.5-7.5M\n\nThat being said. I actually want to estimate it closer to 8 or 9 million, given that most states simply aren't keeping up with the call volume. But that's the wild card in the estimate.\n\nedit:\n\nsomehow my positions were deleted in my last spell correct edit :/\n\nSPY 303P 4/24, SPY 300P 5/15, SPY 210P 6/19, other short positions\n\nedit2:\n\nthe \"priced in\" and \"Brrrr\" and \"meaningless\" comments are expected. and maybe you're right, today it might not mean shit. But the market hasn't priced in the continuing story of bad news. Today maybe it's just that the jobless number estimate was low (although I'm trivializing), but tomorrow that means the 30+M jobless estimate is low. You know what other estimate was low? The death count estimates that was given in a press conference at the White House 2 days ago, more on that below.\n\nPair that with the FACT that this shit isn't ending in April.... or May.... or maybe even June. It could easily go through the summer. Every mounting piece of bad news is more and more evidence to slowly convince every investor that this shit is not going to be whamm..bamm bye Covid -> to the fuckin' moon market. Every negative surprise is another anchor on the back of any bull. And every day the US is shutdown, people are jobless, and not spending cash, another company will become insolvent.\n\nOnce insolvencies start to begin... market panic will occur.\n\nWhat I'm saying is... the market has been sold the \"best case\" story for 3 months. Slowly, every new puzzle piece in the picture will destroy that \"best case\" story. And we are so fucking far from the best case that it's just delusional. This is why [smart money is calling the market dysfunctional](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/outspoken-wall-street-bond-whiz-says-the-stock-market-is-acting-dysfunctional-and-may-hit-rock-bottom-once-we-take-out-marchs-low-2020-03-31). But the equity market won't stay dysfunctional once companies start blowing up - because they can't. Equity of a bankrupt company is 0, it doesn't matter what the fuck the market thinks. This will be the mid-cap, over leveraged, illiquid dog shit. This is why [these companies are ending 401k matching](https://money.yahoo.com/coronavirus-companies-begin-eliminating-401-k-matches-to-cut-costs-182416302.html). They have no cash flow. Cash flow is king, and the fire hose was just shut off. For how long, we don't know. The market thinks it's going to get going again in May. I think it's going to be much later than that.\n\nedit 3: got a little overzealous there\n\nedit 4: fucking called it, https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf\n6.6M\n\nedit 5: ok... so looking at the state to state data I can say I was wildly off on some estimates and spot on on others, thus is the estimation game. I did fuck up the initial claims vs insured unemployment in CT & CA (I counted them all as initial claims). overall, I expect this picture to continue even as SBA loans are being made. Simply because states have still not been able to keep up with calls. All the people who couldn't file last week are still filing this week, also big companies have just begun with mass layoffs this week. I'm still holding on.\n\nThere needs to be some genuinely good news re: the underlying problems before I start selling my puts.\n\nedit 6: as of 8:54am SPY has lost all of its pre-market gains and is now red", "created_utc": 1585821462.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ftjo0r/any_jobless_estimate_below_5m_is_wishful_fucking/", "is_self": true}
