I think this stock doubles.", "selftext": "[Yesterday we killed it]( https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6tthu/lumber_liquidators_ll_a_massive_turnaround_play/) with Lumber Liquidators (LL). Everybody said it was a boring stock. Fuck dat. Ladies, we rocked that boring bitch up 30% and if you played the options game you 6x your money by noon. Don't get cocky, but today I got a WSB for you that's even better. And remember, boring can be beautiful. Here's the DD.\n\n[Position Screenshots](https://imgur.com/rGAHuVL) I've gone balls deep into this stock.\n\n**The Michaels Companies, Inc. (MIK) has 1260 stores and is the largest seller of art supplies in the USA.**\n\n**Two years ago the stock was at $27. Now it's at $5. But it won't stay there for long. This is a WSB triple. In fact, in September of last year, the stock went from $5 to $10 in 7 days. In December (2 months ago) it went from $6 to $9 in 12 days. When this thing moves, it rockets.**\n\n1) The market cap is $700 million, but the company actually earned $320 million in profit last year. And in the last 12 months it made $327 million. (https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MIK/financials?p=MIK) It's basically trading for about 2x earnings. The market is giving this company away. \n\n2) The company knows the shares are undervalued and in the last 9 months, it has repurchased almost 12 million of its own shares. As of November 2, 2019, the company had $293.5 million remaining under their current share repurchase program. At this price, that's enough to buy back almost 50% of the company. [Last quarterly filing]( https://investors.michaels.com/sec-filings/quarterly-reports/content/0001558370-19-011403/mik-20190803x10q1a8a8c.htm?TB_iframe=true&amp;height=auto&amp;width=auto&amp;preload=false). Remember, RH did a massive buyback in 2017 and caused one of the [largest short covering squeezes in history.]( https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-09-07/restoration-hardware-shorts-annihilated-after-company-announces-50-stock-repurchased)\n\n3) Bain Capital and Blackstone own a combined 46% of the company according to the latest [Annual Report](https://investors.michaels.com/sec-filings/annual-reports/content/0001558370-19-002281/mik-20190202x10k.htm?TB_iframe=true&amp;height=auto&amp;width=auto&amp;preload=false). These are two of the smartest private equity firms in the world. Bain Capital associates still have 3 board seats and the Chairman is a former Blackstone managing director. No joke dudes. \n\n\"Affiliates of, or funds advised by, Bain Capital Partners, LLC and The Blackstone Group L.P. (together the \u201cSponsors\u201d) beneficially owned approximately 46% of our outstanding common stock as of February 2, 2019. As long as the Sponsors continue to hold a significant portion of our outstanding common stock, they will be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions, and their interests may conflict with yours or those of our Company.\"\n\nThese guys are real Wall Street players and they will do everything in their power to turn this company around and run the shares higher.\n\n4) The short interest in the company is [48%]( http://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=mik&amp;submit=Short+Quote%E2%84%A2). WTF. Any rally will cause a short covering waterfall and will send the shares skyrocketing. The shorts have had their way with this stock for a year. It's sick. And this baby is ready for a bounce.\n\n5) The company just hired a [new CEO]( https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191227005036/en/Michaels-Companies-Appoints-Ashley-Buchanan-New-CEO). His name is Ashley Buchanan and he was the Chief Merchant for Walmart U.S. eCommerce. This guy is an eCommerce bulldozer. He will turn the company around. He will officially take over as CEO on April 1, 2020. As part of his [employment agreement]( https://investors.michaels.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001104659-19-076303/tm1927469d1_8k.htm?TB_iframe=true&amp;height=auto&amp;width=auto&amp;preload=false_) he was granted options to purchase 500,000 shares and 795,000 restricted stock units. Next year he gets even more options! \n\n\"As part of the 2021 annual equity grants and subject to his continued employment, Mr. Buchanan will be eligible for (i) 500,000 options to purchase shares of the Company\u2019s common stock and (ii) a number of restricted stock units equal to $1,666,666 divided by the closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the grant date.\" \n\nThis new CEO is getting a boatload of shares, and you can be sure his #1 mission will be to turn the company around so the share price will rise.\n\n\n**The best way to play this is with call options. Buy the March 2020 $5 and $7.50 calls. The company reports earnings on March 17 and these things will be rocking leading up to that date. The $5 calls currently trade for about $0.70 and I think they will easily be worth $3. If the shares go to $10 then the $7.50 strike calls will be worth north of $2.50 (currently trading at only $0.15). That's 16x your investment right there.**\n\n**The short squeeze on this thing today will be brutal and I think we can easily see the stock up 30%.
