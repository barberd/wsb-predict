That's going to require loads of construction and building materials.\n\nAgri: GMOs are going to be the only way to feed the world (lol except the poor), organic farming is going to get BTFO as output will need to be increased with a smaller amount of farming land.\n\nWater infrastructure: companies like tyler technologies that make water infrastructure technology and monitoring systems. Water efficiency technology, recycling etc. \n\nALTS: lets go over alt investments, Land in the northern US states and canada is going to be $$$$$$$$$ for the long game. Look at places that will never put into place a Land Value Tax. Just buy empty land in bum ass nowhere Montana and sit on that.\n\nprivate prison groups: refugee camps outside national borders to heard the refugees into.\n\nlong dated food commodities futures\n\nWhat to short:\n\nanything around the equator, coastal cities in poor countries (lol cant afford wall), and if it's possible short human rights because the realpolitik aspirations of nation states wont be able to uphold those anymore. It's either maintain global power or help poor non-citizens.\n\n\nany other ideas", "created_utc": 1562020061, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c8142d/how_to_make_money_in_regards_to_global_warming/", "is_self": true}
