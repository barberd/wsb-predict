Fucking jello hands? Small PP syndrome? Whatever it is, I have it. \n\nHere are my last 6 trades:\n\n$60 RY 3/20 puts bought at $3.60, sold at $3.10. Now trading at $4.85\n\n$150 MCD 4/3 puts bought at $8.00, sold at $7.50. Now trading at $19.00. \n\nGSK bought at $35.57 sold at $33.95. Now at $34.09\n\nMRNA bought at ~$21 sold at $22.79. Now at $30.92.\n\nINO bought at $7.30, sold at $6.01. Now at $7.05\n\n$35 Zillow 3/20 puts bought at $4.60, sold at $7.70. Now at 13.05. \n\nNow I'm still up 3% this week overall. That's fucking amazing for a regular investor in this market. But I have left literally thousands of dollars on the table. If I had held until today, I would be up 150%. WSB isn't just about making the right calls, it's also about being able to stick to your guns through the ups and downs. It's about being willing to YOLO your cash.\n\nIf you're like me and are a normie who stumbled across this subreddit and thought that you could do this, beware. You can't know if you have \ud83d\udc8e hands until it's too late. I'm lucky that my phone ran out of battery for 2 hours, otherwise I would have lost 5%.\n\nI have 1 more put on the table, and I'm having my GF change the password of my Robinhood for 2 weeks, because I fucking know it's gonna print, but I'm too much of a pussy to not sell when I'm up another 5%. But after that, I'm out. I'm just not cut out for this. I'm only a little aspergers. You gotta be full on autistic to make the big bucks.", "created_utc": 1584549713.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkskmm/reminder_if_you_dont_have_hands_this_subreddit/", "is_self": true}
