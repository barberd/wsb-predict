They got lucky at the end though. \n\nRussia lost 80% of its account when it shorted Germany, YOLO'ed the last 20% on Germany puts and regained most of its losses. \n\nAmerica was buying the dip and reinvesting dividends.", "created_utc": 1566247224, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/csn11g/the_wsb_version_of_world_war_2/", "is_self": true}
