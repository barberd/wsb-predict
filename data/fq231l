I\u2019m your host and resident autist u/expander2. You have to be able to read to gain anything from this so that rules out about half of you. As always, this is organized from most important at the top to least important at the bottom. A TLDR, plays, and previous DD summaries will be at the bottom. My last posts still stand and hold some good info so check it out for more plays if this isn't enough for you greedy fucks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDISCLAIMER; I am not personally advocating for any play that I add to this list. I merely go through a couple of days of posts and find what I think is competent DD. PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs is tradition, I shall start with the news. [Boris Johnson](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fpv7i4/boris_johnson_tests_positive_for_covid19/) (The UK's Trump) has tested positive for WuFlu. That=we are fuk. There is news [that GM](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpqf7b/gm_building_mass_ventilators_fake_news_people/) and Ford will not be building ventilators for the hospitals as DJ Trump said. They did not realize the logistics and that transmissions and ventilators are not the same thing. For those of us that cant extrapolates, this means fewer ventilators for victims of China's Plague of Doom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Federal Government and JPow are spending a shit load on trying to keep the SS Economy from taking a nose dive to the Marianas Trench. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpjjde/i_crunched_the_feds_spending_and_it_says_more_puts/) explains the numbers and there are even pictures for you to look at. The Fed is throwing lots and lots of money at this problem to make the ship sink a little slower. Well, they can't do that forever and today is clearly an example of that. Money only makes people happy for so long, especially when their family is dying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow I know we hate every other investing subreddit, however, [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fp4vxy/my_experience_of_the_2008_bailout/) is a good (serious) view of what the coming months will look like and relates what is coming to 2008. We are ticking all the boxes of similarities and that is not a good thing. Not saying its gonna be as bad as The Great Recession but lookout.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext is another bit of knowledge for you fucks. My boy u/fuzzyblankeet did one of the [best breakdowns](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fplquv/something_fishy_fuzzys_seas_covenant_breakdown/) I have ever seen using SeaWorld (SEAS) as an example. He explains how to break down any companies 10-K (which is an annual report about the financials, company makeup, etc.). He shows us retards how to do a targeted review, breakdown and understand their debt, and goes over financial covenants. These are all big words but if you read the post then it'll be a lot easier to understand. Reading this post will allow you to do YOUR OWN DD instead of relying on WSB and fucking idiots like me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn to the actual plays. Mariott (MAR) looks like it's gonna have some problems because of the Beer Flu. No one is traveling right now so no one is booking hotel rooms. No bookings= no revenue. Expect a drop in earnings, and because of this, a drop in stock price. MAR 5/15 50p is what [the OP said](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpiimx/big_dd_marriott_is_dead/) but I would go for a higher strike because people will want to sell at the price of the stock now ($80) if it drops to $50 a share.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLikewise, oil is going to be something to watch in the coming weeks. If America and our economy goes tits up, oil goes tits up according to [this guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fp9ff7/the_fall_of_oil_and_how_you_can_make_tendies/).  The US economy grinding to a standstill will compound with the Saudis dropping the price per barrel and ramping up production. His post gives us a few ways to profit from the fall of oil including ETFs, options, and stocks. Puts on any oil company that can not support itself through this and make sure they expire late April/May. Note, DO NOT play with DWT or UWT. They are being delisted on April 3rd. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Warning; satire!) Now I'm gonna do a little fear-mongering. So the book of Revelations tells humans how the world will end. The 4 horsemen of the apocalypse will come (Famine, Death, War, Pestilence), trumpets will sound, and the end will be nigh. We already have death and pestilence (which means plague) because of COVID19. Famine is coming with the [GIANT SWARM OF LOCUSTS](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/why-a-plague-of-locusts-is-threatening-crops-in-africa-and-beyond/ar-BB11JOHX?li=BBnb7Kz) 3 times the size of New York in Africa and the middle east. And with China and the US having a [dick measuring contest](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpsulz/trade_war_part_2/) in the Taiwan Strait we are looking at the possibility of war. Also, are we sure that God said trumpets and not Trump/Pence? Just kidding, this is all bullshit, I don't believe in God. If he's real then he's a dick.  Strike me down where I stand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBig Stupid Idiot of the Day is [this man](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpm6qt/ive_been_told_to_come_here_to_make_it_all_back/). Why would you come to WSB to make your money back? What a fucking idiot. I thought that everyone knew we only lost money here. You lose $260,000 and come to the hive mind of autism for help? Fuck off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck fuckers and tune in on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for more WSB DD Summaries!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Boris Johnson is fuk, GM and Ford are not medical manufacturers, Feds can only fuck the market for so long, Mariott is fucked possibly, Oil is fucked possibly, and the Book of Revelations is happening.\n\nPlays; MAR 5/15 50p (Eh, probably a higher strike), any Oil company that can't support themselves (Except DWT and UWT)\n\nPrevious WSB DD Summaries; [3/21-3/23](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fnui1i/i_compiled_dd_from_the_last_3_days_for_you_cucks/), [3/24-3/25](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fp0s8l/wsb_dd_summary_324325_plays_and_tldr_included/)", "created_utc": 1585332441.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fq231l/wsb_dd_summary_326327_plays_and_tldr_included/", "is_self": true}
