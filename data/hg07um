{"id": "hg07um", "title": "PTON long dick style!", "selftext": "I need everyone of you that is gambling your 401k away to get your hand off your meat rod and go buy calls on PTON. Earnings come out end of next month. Peloton is the future of home gym equipment. You can by the equipment at full resale or have a monthly subscription similar to a gym but without all the added fees. They are up 60% this year in sales alone and have an insane amount of advertising clout. When they beat earnings, I'll buy everyone dilly bars from Dairy queen. Calls on Dairy Queen as well. \ud83d\ude0e", "created_utc": 1593142304.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hg07um/pton_long_dick_style/", "is_self": true}
