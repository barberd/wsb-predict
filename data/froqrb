I work primarily with non-agency MBS but also do a lot of work with agency credit risk transfer (CRT) bonds. TL;DR of CRT bonds is they are issued by the Fannie and Freddie and they pay less if Fannie and Freddie start taking losses on the mortgages they guarantee.\n\nGiven my time constraints, I'm going to pick and choose what  I respond to/clarify in the original post. Overall it is a fantastic write-up, but I feel there's a couple of things I can add to it given I have a different view of the industry given my different position.\n\n>although the Servicer does not own the asset, they have the responsibility to make the payment to the investor, even if they have not yet received it from the borrower.\n\nMy understanding in agency loans is the servicer is heavily incentivized but not legally required to advance the principal and interest payments. Basically, if their loans start taking heavier losses than other servicers and they don't advance, this will hurt their relationship with Fannie/Freddie. However, if this is happening across the board, everyone's rating goes down so it doesn't impact the servicers competitiveness relative to others. So, while it's not good for a servicer to not advance P&I, it's not a major breaking point.\n\n>I'M FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND I'M HERE TO HELP In the Government\u2019s effort to help those who have lost their jobs because of the Coronavirus shutdown, they have granted forbearance of mortgage payments for affected individuals. This presents an enormous obstacle for Servicers who are obligated to forward the mortgage payment to the investor, even though they have not yet received it.\n\nIt's not clear to me whether forbearance has to be advanced, so I'll take the OP's word for it. I'd recommend someone with more time to actually look into what Fannie and Freddie expect regarding forbearance.\n\n>But what has not been yet contemplated is the fact that a borrower who does not make their first mortgage payment causes the loan to be ineligible to be sold to an investor. This means that the Servicer must hold onto the asset itself, which ties up their available credit. And with so many new loans being originated of late, the amount of transactions that will not qualify for sale is significant. This restricts the Lender\u2019s ability to clear their pipeline and get reimbursed with cash so they can now fund new transactions.\n\nThis is true and could present a massive issue, but as of right now we don't know how many people will actually miss their first payment. I think it is likely that a large number of people refinancing to lower their rate are the same demographic who will have a few months savings as a cushion, but who knows what % don't.\n\n>MARK TO MARKET This week - Due to accelerated prepayments and the uncertainty of repayment, the value of servicing was slashed in half from 1% to 0.5%. This drastic decrease in value prompted margin calls for the many Servicers who financed their acquisition of servicing. Additionally, the decreased value of a Lender\u2019s servicing portfolio reduces the Lender\u2019s overall net worth. Since the amount a lender can lend is based on a multiple of their net worth, the decrease in value of their servicing portfolio asset, along with the cash paid for margin calls, reduces their capacity to lend.\n\nThis is true, however in other mortgage products we saw a large rebound in value this last week. Also, at this point most if not all credit providers are offering forbearance to these firms who can't meet margin call. However, if mortgages and related products have another drop in value it could be painful.\n\nI'm out of time but wanted to touch briefly on how mortgage servicers hedge. My understanding is this section contains the biggest inaccuracy in the original post. Mortgage servicers do NOT hedge using MBS, they hedge by shorting pools of mortgage loans. While there are still downsides to this due to the negative convexity of mortgages, these are a more direct hedge than MBS and remove a layer of the disjointedness that markets have been experiencing the last few weeks.\n\nOh, one more thing. Most of this stuff is already priced in. Remember those CRT bonds I mentioned in the beginning of this post? Some of those bonds have gone from trading at ~$140 to in the $20s, representing an 80% drop. And you guys thought equities were performing poorly, lol.\n\nTL;DR shit is bad and can get worse, but isn't quite as bad as the OP.", "created_utc": 1585566255.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/froqrb/mortgage_servicing_crisis_explained_from_an_mbs/", "is_self": true}
