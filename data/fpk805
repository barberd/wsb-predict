If backtesting is to be believed and ignoring the uniqueness of the factors, this means that there will be a 95% chance of recession within the next year.\n\nWith data obviously being skewed due to the beer flu, could this relatively new metric still bear any weight? \n\nMost of all, is this priced in? Do you think that the market has over/underestimated the rise in unemployment or the knock on economic effects that this will have? \n\nI have a feeling this is a bull trap, markets were way overvalued (and acting manic with some of the run ups some stocks have seen, think: TSLA, SPCE, even BYND a while back, etc) and the system was showing cracks even before corona broke out... sketchy corp loans, leveraged derivatives of said sketchy loans, repo operations  (and unwillingness to use them, which is a rabbit hole itself), \u2018backwards\u2019 macroprudential tools of central policy (reserve requirement now at 0%) and of course the global liquidity trap. \n\nI feel that the current market run is long term r/investing types that are DCAing and otherwise employing capital to buy the dip, which is of course squeezing the shorts and killing the vega and theta extrinsic value for all you \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bs. Whilst we have had extreme volatility, after the recent mini bull run we have not had a recessions worth of devaluation, so what is going on with the large rallies? \n\nAm I, (are you?), overvaluing the economic detriment of Kung flu?\n\nThis sub has become an echo chamber of sorts for doomsayers and I\u2019d like to hear what the chad bulls, if there are any left, have to say. \n\nWhilst this sub is the best on Reddit for it\u2019s general jokey demeanour, I\u2019m hoping this will trigger an enlightening conversation. The loss porn is fun, the huge gains are fomo-inducing and the memes are top quality but I wouldn\u2019t spend nearly as much time here if it wasn\u2019t for the intelligent musings you occasionally stumble upon, even if you have to infer it. Like, reading a well thought out post with solid DD, or insights providing another 0.01% of the big picture of the world of finance. These are the crack that keeps me coming back.
