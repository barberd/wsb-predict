See the tldr for strategy and positions.\n\nLike many of you, I made a good chunk of change off TSLA and SPCE calls. Shortly afterwards my mom grounded me from Wallstreetbets and Robinhood for doing coke. When I returned to the sub I saw how many gay bears had freshly bleached assholes due to profiting off of puts(???)\n\nSeeing those freshly bleached assholes really got me thinking and I started questioning my sexuality, and so I bought my first put. SPY 185 4/17. Almost instantly Jpow impaled my lower intestines with his giant Shrek cock. I knew what it was to be a bear. I felt shame and disgust.\n\n The Bulls in my Lamborghini enthusiasts Facebook laughed at me. And so I did exactly what I did with my Microsoft 3/20 200c when Jeff Bezos tried to cockblock me over that cloud contract. I doubled down and bought more OTM options out of spite. \n\nI don't need to explain the last 2 weeks to you autists in order for you to figure out how many tendies I had left at EOD Monday, 4/13.\n\nOn a whim of nostalgia and I stalked my exes page. After some scrolling I found it. SPCE calls. I decided to buy some. Nothing makes sense in this market anyways. Maybe Jpow would stop using the gag ball if I showed willingness to repent my gay bear desires. \n\nWhen I woke up the next day I checked my spy puts. Somehow even more worthless than before. Something felt off. I went into my settings to try and turn off \"green mode\" on Robinhood when I remembered those SPCE calls. Suddenly, looking at my positions I had an epiphany. \n\n*Until* the mythical triple limit down black Tuesday happens...STONKS ONLY GO UP. \n\nTL;DR *REPRESS YOUR GAY BEAR INSTICTS BUT DO NOT FORGET THEM. BUY CALLS ON LITERALLY ANY STOCK AND HEDGE YOURSELF WITH SPY PUTS. WE ARE BULLS IN THE STREETS AND BEARS IN THE SHEETS*\n\npositions: SPY 5/15 240p, SPY 6/19 240p and a FUCK TON OF CALLS ON EVERYTHING ELSE.", "created_utc": 1586907217.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1gi2m/if_you_bought_puts_expiring_in_april_i_have_a/", "is_self": true}
