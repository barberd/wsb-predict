{"id": "hiu67k", "title": "Twitter: A Market Analcyst", "selftext": "We all know Twitter is the red-headed step social platform child that everyone likes to hate. Jack Dorsey is a clown, and has done nothing to spur the company towards at LEAST getting to be on fucking par with its peers (FB, INSTA, SNAP, etc)\n\nObviously you know where I'm going with this, but just hear me out.\n\nAt the start of the COVID-19 downturn, there was a huge shake-up in the board management. The activist investment hedge fund manager P.S.Elliott decided to try to take shit over and make some money finally. Dorsey was able to scramble and get a deal with silver lake to stave off getting fired. Again, you probably know all this already. In any case, they got some voting power on the board now to try to make changes, but I'm most excited about having Dr. Fei-Fei Li there. A Stanford computer scientist, she actually might be able to improve the platform going forward. So that's green flag #1.\n\nAs the market rebounded, Twitter miraculously recovered most of what it had lost. Personally, I think it should've gone higher faster, given how many new people are on Twitter. The amount of new mDAU's is record-breaking in the history of the platform. Green flag #2.\n\nFacebook has been the target of an ad boycott by major companies, and that has spilled over onto Twitter in an almost completely proportional (by %) way, in terms of the recent crush it has experienced. Facebook is shrugging it off, like a boss, because that's what evil corporations do. They make tons of money off ads, but it's not their only revenue stream. For Twitter, the ads are what keep it afloat. So thats RED flag #1.\n\nRed flag?!\n\nSo thats why it's time to buy now. Because if anyone's been picking a fight with Orange Cheeto (tweet labeling/censorship/whatever you want to call it), it's been Twitter leading the charge there. They should be praised and loved by the Civil Rights Action groups (and notably, are NOT the target of the ad boycott). So why is Twitter suffering the wrath of these companies pulling ads from \"all social media.\" It does not make sense. If Chewbacca lives on Endor, you must acquit!\n\nAs soon as these analysts pull their heads out of their asses, they'll realize that Twitter earnings are around the corner (7/23 in the MORNING). But those ads are NOT being blocked outside of the US. Twitter has 79% of its users international. So even this partial blowback of the ad boycott is completely mispriced. And when those earnings come, they're going to show that the world uses Twitter more than any other platform or news outlet for breaking news. It's the only reason we know what is happening at the STREET LEVEL during these protests. And the whole world is protesting. Green flag #3.\n\nTwitter is going to blow these earnings out of the water. I think it's time to buy stock now. Options, too, maybe don't put all your eggs into one basket... but who am I to judge.\n\n$TWTR Price Target should be like $37 for earnings, $41 by the end of the year, and I wouldn't be surprised if it hits $50 or more in 2021. I made all these price target numbers up and am long Twitter, suck my balls, thanks.", "created_utc": 1593544855.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hiu67k/twitter_a_market_analcyst/", "is_self": true}
