{"id": "d1x3mj", "title": "500%+ Option Play On UNH", "selftext": "This FCF generating machine has been beaten down based on political fears. The company is expecting revenue growth of over 8% and earnings up 13%. As Congress comes back into session and the markets start to realize that Cocaine Mitch is completely bought by the health care lobby the market will start pricing no new restrictions on the health care industry.  This company is also highly recession resistant and is trading near 52 week lows. \n\nMy recommended play is the October 17th, 2019 Calls with a strike of $240. The market price for these calls is $3.60. These options will take you through earnings on the week of the 17th. You can either take profits going into earnings or play for a massive bump. This is the quarter where analysts will get a good look at how 2020 is shaping up and I expect another large buyback from the company and solid guidance. My price target is a breakout back to the $260s after earnings are released and a run up to the $240s before earnings. If the stock reaches $260 you will profit 450% and at $270 you will profit 720%.\n\nIf you are truly about the Yolo life you can purchase the $250 Calls for $1.40. These would pay out 614% at $260 and 1329% at $270.", "created_utc": 1568063148, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d1x3mj/500_option_play_on_unh/", "is_self": true}
