If I only knew then what I know now.\n\nI opened up a margin account and as a soon to be savvy investor I took to WSB to make the tendies rain. \n\nLast week I bought spy puts and before I knew it I got hit with a margin call. I ignored it obviously and then today questrade came to my farm and talked to me face to face for about wanting me to pay back their money. \n\nObviously I didn\u2019t have the money so questrade decided to settle my debts in a different way. They went outside and fucked Maggie, Jim and Martha (my 3 goats) in plain sight. They looked so helpless but I knew I owed questrade so I had to let them proceed.\n\nI\u2019ve contacted questrade support about this incident and am hoping for some funding for the anxiety medication needed for my goats after questrade fucked all 3 of them against their will.\n\n\nPlease support me and my goats and close your questrade accounts.\n\nAMD 40p 4/15", "created_utc": 1585892846.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fu2red/how_questrade_ruined_my_goats/", "is_self": true}
