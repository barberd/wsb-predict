Here is his most recent portfolio. (Friend sent me this)\n\nShort MDCO - really hard to believe this drug will do well. The stock is up 50% since the last update, despite the lack of success of other PCSK9 and ESPRs momentum. Much better entry point here.\nShort 084990: My #1 short worked out, dropping 30-40%. Given the company has no assets, it is somewhat remarkable it did not drop more, but that is Korea for you.\nShort XON - another top short working well, down about 30%\nShort Telecom/Media: nothing has happened here, yet. AT&amp;T went up about 20%, VZ 5%, DIS 10% and CMCSA 5%. There is just so much content out there between social media and streaming, it s hard to fathom that monetization will continue at this unabated rate. The bashing of Marvel movies by an acclaimed director is telling. I continue to think the Internet is a huge deflationary, democratizing force that these companies are exposed to.\nShort ACAD - This dog has almost doubled on some fake data. Sometimes it's best to throw in the towel.\nShort WEED, ACB, TLRY - all of these stocks have fallen 50%. Fascinating.\nShort LULU - up 15% since update, still think we're in the 9th inning of this athleisure trend\nShort RETA - nearly doubled. i think if i wasn't in the SHU i might have not gotten run over. thankfully a 1% position.\nShort TSLA - up 50%. was a little uncomfortable with this one, got sucked in like an idiot.\nShort SAGE - working pretty well. I think the drug has bad side effects\nShort BA - the only stock where literally everything you could ever want as a short is happening but it doesn't go down\n\nLong BMRN - down about 15% in the last 6 months. very cheap in my opinion. i think hemophilia gene therapy will sell fine.\nLong ALXN - just about the same as BMRN, a good value, will do its thing.\nLong REGN - up around 10% in the last 6 months, the tide of fear is turning\nLong RGNX - Down 30% or so. Still great value I think but worth dusting off to be sure\nLong RARE - probably the biggest mistake, down around 40%. the gene therapies aren't working and the rest of the portfolio is basically Crysvita which is largely 4151's drug\nLong UBER - down about 50%. Well... that didn't go right. My theory that they have a lot of cash/investments may not be perfect since the Didi investment could be overvalued (see the rest of Softbank's portfolio).\nLong GSK - Up 10% without dividends, my perrenial big pharma favorite.\nLong BMY - Up almost 30%, really nice trade here for such a large cap.\nLong ABBV - Up 20%, similar to BMY.\nLong BIIB - Nice and lucky with the AD news but value investing is all about 'free luck'.\nLong AMGN - Up around 15%.\nLong SGEN - nearly doubled :)\nLong SRPT - down 30% or so, not sure what to do there\nLong BOLD - thesis has not changed, stock quite a bit cheaper", "created_utc": 1575573563, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e6m15f/shkreli_dd_included_short_sage_and_mdco_long_bold/", "is_self": true}
