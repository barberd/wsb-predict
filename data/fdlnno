{"id": "fdlnno", "title": "XAIR update", "selftext": "So I've received a few PMs regarding the meeting I had.  I spoke with the CCO and an engineer from the company and they basically gave me a rundown of the machine.  They wouldn't go into much detail regarding the business side of things but did say they hope to gain approval by the AARC convention this year, which is November 14 of this year.  I'm hoping they announce that they filed for approval on Investor's day March 5.  \n\nSince I've written about XAIR they have nearly doubled and I don't think they are even close to done.  They rang the closing bell the other day up 13% and will probably continue to climb as they gain more notoriety.  The prompt from Nasdaq said they have potential of 4 B in sales, which I believe will at least be 300 million in the next couple of years.  At a market cap of 110 M they could have a pretty nice valuation.\n\nI asked the CCO what they're biggest weakness was and he said from his side of things it will be scaling up and effectively selling the product to everyone that wants it.\n\nOverall, still looking very strong.  We'll probably see some pull back from current levels as going straight up isn't sustainable but a good long run stock.
