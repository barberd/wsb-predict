I\u2019ve been investing 33% of my wages for about 6 months for a very humble return thankfully.\n\nI envy everyone that is able to use RobinHood to trade as in my country (New Zealand) RobinHood is not available and from what I\u2019ve read our laws are prohibiting RobinHood from providing there services here (Not exactly sure how) \n\nI can\u2019t find anywhere reliable that allows me to Day trade the US stock market without finding a huge compilation of crap reviews online (like Plus500, which I\u2019m still on the fence about? But 90% sure it\u2019s a scam, with people having withdraw issues etc) \n\nThe way I have to trade is through HatchInvest.nz. I can only BUY stocks and cannot bet against the market, this puts me in a shit position to start with because I can only play the upside. They do not allow day trading as when you sell a share you own the process is not completed for 2 days, although the sell is completed instantly and the money is available in your portfolio to invest again right away, you cannot sell any shares you buy with that money before the process is completed through there US broker, selling shares you have brought with the money from another recently sold share will result in a black mark on your account, so no day trading unless you want to buy and sell one.\n\nThe fees are as follows and I would like to know if this is reasonable. I know commission free is a thing now but I just simply can\u2019t seem to find it available to me in New Zealand.\n\n\nPay a flat $3 USD fee to buy or sell a fraction of one share, OR\n\nPay $0.02 USD a share ($8 USD min) to buy or sell one or more shares (e.g. 20.3 Apple shares = $8 USD)\n\n_________________________________\n\n\nI guess my overall question is: \n\nWHERE THE FUCK CAN THIS AUTIST DAY TRADE?! HELP.  Specifically Australian WSBers as maybe like the Plus500 shit may be available to me in NZ as well.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for the shit post.
