{"id": "cv9ry7", "title": "UBS + Deutsche Bank merger = the perfect short", "selftext": "Saw an article from WSJ pop up this morning talking about how at one point UBS and Deutche Bank were considering a merger. I didn\u2019t actually read that shit but basically if this happened it would be the perfect opportunity to short after the potential initial pop. \n\nWhy you may ask? Because these two banks are the laughing stock of the industry. Both have suffered massive loss in market cap over the last year, are scandal ridden, and frankly retarded. It would be like combining this sub with r/politics or some shit. \n\nJust yesterday my grandfather was asking me how options work Bc he read an article in the paper about UBS being sued by clients who\u2019d been roped into a 5:1 leveraged derivatives portfolio and lost bigly this month. And the day before I was listening to a podcast from 2006 where Cramer was shitting on UBS even back then. I think his exact words were something like \u201cthen I\u2019d go buy puts from someone who doesn\u2019t even know what\u2019s going on, like UBS.\u201d Thanks for that Cramer.\n\nAnyway I honestly wouldn\u2019t be surprised if half these companies shareholders are in this sub if it weren\u2019t for the fact that no one here would ever buy a low P/E dividend stock. It must be the board then that\u2019s on here trying to figure shit out. Hell maybe that\u2019s where they got the idea in the first place. Anyway boys my private jets about to take off, gtg.
