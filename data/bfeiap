Good afternoon and happy Saturday to all of you on this subreddit. I hope everyone made out pretty nicely in the market last week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 22nd, 2019.\n\n# **Earnings and data could be proof that slowdown fears were overblown  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/19/earnings-and-data-could-be-proof-that-slowdown-fears-were-overblown.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Earnings season shifts into a higher gear in the week ahead, as investors also watch for fresh economic data that could show that the economy is pulling out of a temporary rut.\n*****\n&gt; Amazon, Boeing, Microsoft and ExxonMobil are among more than 140 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting quarterly results. According to Refinitiv, 74% of the companies reporting so far have beaten expectations. Based on forecasts and actual reports, earnings for the S&amp;P 500 as a whole are expected to decline 1.7%, the first negative quarter in three years. Some forecasters had projected an earnings decline of 4% or more.\n*****\n&gt; The equivalent of the economy\u2019s first-quarter report card will be released Friday, with the first reading of GDP. The outlook for first-quarter growth has suddenly shifted upward, after a series of better data releases later in the quarter. CNBC/Moody\u2019s Analytics Rapid Update survey shows economists\u2019median forecast is now tracking at 2.4%, way above the 1% expected earlier in the quarter, when severe winter weather and the government shutdown were stifling the economy.\n*****\n&gt; At the same time, investors are feeling better about global growth and far less fearful of a recession in the near term. One reason is that China\u2019s data has also been picking up. This past week, China reported first-quarter GDP at 6.4%, slightly better than the 6.3% expected by economists.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think a lot of this is leveraged on economic activity. I think investors have kind of gotten past this notion of global downturn. The China number was pretty good earlier in the week. I do think next week is going to be important for earnings. We\u2019re going to get a great cross section of industries,\u201d said Jack Ablin, CIO at Cresset Wealth Advisors. On Wednesday, China\u2019s first quarter GDP\n*****\n&gt; U.S. trade talks with China could be also important in the week ahead, with negotiations continuing and investors awaiting news of a summit between President Donald Trump and China President Xi Jinping.\n*****\n&gt; Dan Suzuki, portfolio strategist at Richard Bernstein Advisors, said he still sees deteriorating fundamentals for both earnings and the economy, even though data appears to be improving.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s a function of expectations were probably dropping too quickly, and I think recent data is telling you that growth isn\u2019t collapsing but it\u2019s slowing,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s very important. That\u2019s probably going to be the most important dynamic. That\u2019s probably going to continue.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; That could make for a choppier market at some point, he said. Suzuki said he could see stocks ending the year higher than current levels but he expects to see the market pull back first.\n*****\n&gt; The market shrugged off Thursday\u2019s release of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on the Trump campaign and Russian election interference.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis type of thing firmly falls into the category of it can move the needle for the market on a daily or weekly performance basis, but it\u2019s not going to be a longer term story for the market,\u201d Suzuki said. Analysts have said the economy\u2019s performance is more important for Trump\u2019s reelection than the report at this point.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://finviz.com/publish/041819/sec_all_w1_172296422.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/YVzys7Y.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/p5M3cmQ.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/NePiUFY.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/TobFvKR.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/h8Eq5bp.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BbGACws.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/dZN6aqZ.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/I7U3Q9A.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\nNONE SCHEDULED FOR THIS UPCOMING WEEK.\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/9asLRmX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/5m8LayE.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Pre-election year Mays: Just 10th overall DJIA and S&amp;P 500\n\n&gt; May officially marks the beginning of the \u201cWorst Six Months\u201d for the DJIA and S&amp;P. To wit: \u201cSell in May and go away.\u201d Our \u201cBest Six Months Switching Strategy,\u201d created in 1986, proves that there is merit to this old trader\u2019s tale. A hypothetical $10,000 investment in the DJIA compounded to a gain of $1,008,721 for November-April in 68 years compared to just $1,031 for May-October. The same hypothetical $10,000 investment in the S&amp;P 500 compounded to $757,335 for November-April in 68 years compared to a gain of just $9,079 for May-October.\n\n&gt; May has been a tricky month over the years, a well-deserved reputation following the May 6, 2010 \u201cflash crash\u201d. It used to be part of what we called the \u201cMay/June disaster area.\u201d From 1965 to 1984 the S&amp;P 500 was down during May fifteen out of twenty times. Then from 1985 through 1997 May was the best month, gaining ground every single year (13 straight gains) on the S&amp;P, up 3.3% on average with the DJIA falling once and two NASDAQ losses.\n\n&gt; In the years since 1997, May\u2019s performance has been erratic; DJIA up ten times in the past twenty years (three of the years had gains in excess of 4%). NASDAQ suffered five May losses in a row from 1998-2001, down \u2013 11.9% in 2000, followed by eleven sizable gains in excess of 2.5% and four losses, the worst of which was 8.3% in 2010. Since 1950, pre-election-year Mays rank poorly, #10 DJIA and S&amp;P 500, #7 NASDAQ, #6 Russell 1000 and #5 Russell 2000.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8b63d458d074ef227692acda9189db81/tumblr_inline_pq6cpwpk6s1spdppr_400.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Liberate Your Portfolio Sell Passover\n\n&gt; Much like the ancient Hebrews\u2019 exodus out of Egypt, springtime and the Passover holiday are often an excellent time of year to consider major portfolio moves.\n\n&gt; Some may remember the old saying on the Street, \u201cBuy Rosh Hashanah, Sell Yom Kippur.\u201d Though it had a good record at one time, it stopped working in the middle of the last century. It still gets tossed around every autumn when the \u201chigh holidays\u201d are on the minds of traders as many take off to observe the Jewish New Year and Day of Atonement.\n\n&gt; The basis for the new pattern, \u201cSell Rosh Hashanah-Buy Yom Kippur-Sell Passover,\u201d is that with many traders and investors busy with religious observance and family, positions are closed out and volume fades creating a buying vacuum. Actual stats on the most observed Hebrew holidays have been compiled in the table here.\n\n&gt; We present the data back to 1971 and when the holiday falls on a weekend the prior market close is used. It\u2019s no coincidence that Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur fall in September and/or October, two dangerous and opportune months. We then took it a step further and calculated the return from Yom Kippur to Passover, which conveniently occurs in March or April, right near the end of our \u201cBest Six Months\u201d strategy.\n\n&gt; Perhaps it\u2019s Talmudic wisdom but, selling stocks before the eight-day span of the high holidays has avoided many declines, especially during uncertain times. While being long Yom Kippur to Passover has produced 55% more advances, half as many losses and average gains of 7.2%. It often pays to be a contrarian when old bromides are tossed around, buying instead of selling Yom Kippur \u2013 and selling Passover. From Passover to Yom Kippur DJIA averages just 1.6% and is littered with nasty declines.\n\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9f2d78911ef8eee527659fdd4f7b38a2/tumblr_inline_pq43bl43711spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Individual Investors Remaining Neutral\n\n&gt; Last week, bullish sentiment as indicated by the AAII's weekly survey of individual investors came in at the second highest level of the year at 40.29%. Declines this week seemed to have weighed on bulls as the percentage of investors reporting as bullish fell to 37.56%. That is back below the historical average of 38.2%, though, it is also not far away from where bullish sentiment has stayed for much of the year. This week's level deviates slightly from the Investors Intelligence survey which saw bearish sentiment unchanged while optimism rose to the highest levels since October.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/041819-AAII-Bullish-Sentiment.png))**\n\n&gt; The bearish camp seems to have borrowed from the bulls as 21.83% of investors reported bearish sentiment versus 20.38% last week. This is a fairly small movement relative to what could be observed in the past couple of months. For example, last week and in the final week of March, bearish sentiment fell by over 7%. In other words, bearish sentiment seems stable around the lower end of the range from the past few years, now several percentage points below the historical average of 30.31%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/041819-AAII-Bearish-Sentiment.png))**\n\n&gt; While bullish and bearish sentiment remains high and low, respectively, neutral sentiment is also very elevated. At 40.61%, the percentage of investors reporting neutral sentiment is now slightly over one standard deviation above the historical average. The last time this happened was in late July of last year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/041819-AAII-Bearish-Sentiment.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Mortgage Applications Hit Nine-Year High\n\n&gt; This morning the Mortgage Bankers' Association (MBA) reported mortgage application volumes for the week ending April 12th this morning. Refinancing volumes dropped over 8% after an 11.4% WoW drop last week. Refinancing is still running at a strong pace (roughly twice the pace where they finished last year), but the more economically relevant result was the strong purchase application data. Applications for purchase are a leading indicator of home sales, so the new cycle high in purchase application volumes posted this week is a good sign that the housing market remains in a much better position than where it stood last year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/041719-MBA-2.png))**\n\n&gt; Weekly data can be tricky to seasonally adjust, so it's also worth taking a peek at weekly data without seasonal adjustments. As shown, we're right near the typical seasonal peak for application volumes, and as-of this week, only two weeks since 2009 have recorded stronger purchase application volumes. That confirms the basic message of the seasonally adjusted index, which is that mortgage applications are running at a very strong pace.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/041719-MBA-1.png))**\n\n&gt; On a YoY basis, purchase application volumes are not extremely strong, but it's pretty clear there's a healthier trend than the period in the second half of last year. Since week-to-week applications can be pretty volatile, it helps to smooth things out with a rolling 4-week average. Using this approach, the 4-week average of purchase applications is up 8.2% YoY, the best pace since the week ended February 9th of last year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/041719-MBA-4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Chart of the Day: Fourth Best Start on Record in Junk Bond Market\n\n&gt; After a rough Q4 for the junk bond market, 2019 has turned into a banner year for the sector. As measured by the Merrill Lynch High Yield Master Index, the total return for the high yield market through Tuesday's close has been a gain of 8.67%, making it the fourth-best start to a year for the sector on record and the best start since 2009. This year's gain also marks the eighth time since 1987 that the high yield market had gained more than 6% through 4/16.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/041719-1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for April 18th, 2019** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 04.21.19** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$AMZN**\n&gt; * **$FB** \n&gt; * **$BA** \n&gt; * **$TWTR** \n&gt; * **$MSFT** \n&gt; * **$TSLA** \n&gt; * **$T** \n&gt; * **$SNAP** \n&gt; * **$CAT** \n&gt; * **$VZ** \n&gt; * **$HAL** \n&gt; * **$KO** \n&gt; * **$PG** \n&gt; * **$INTC** \n&gt; * **$LMT** \n&gt; * **$F** \n&gt; * **$CLF** \n&gt; * **$V** \n&gt; * **$XLNX** \n&gt; * **$CNC** \n&gt; * **$PYPL** \n&gt; * **$GWW** \n&gt; * **$BIIB** \n&gt; * **$STLD** \n&gt; * **$UTX** \n&gt; * **$CMG** \n&gt; * **$UPS** \n&gt; * **$ABBV** \n&gt; * **$NOK** \n&gt; * **$KMB** \n&gt; * **$DPZ** \n&gt; * **$MO** \n&gt; * **$AAL** \n&gt; * **$XOM** \n&gt; * **$JBLU** \n&gt; * **$SBUX** \n&gt; * **$BMY** \n&gt; * **$ANTM** \n&gt; * **$LRCX** \n&gt; * **$HOG** \n&gt; * **$BOH** \n&gt; * **$LUV** \n&gt; * **$IRBT** \n&gt; * **$NUE** \n&gt; * **$FCX**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/I7U3Q9A.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/tbDs9W8.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/5nWvC9S.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.22.19 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/U8rUlRU.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.22.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eGinu8Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.23.19 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/FGGlgZC.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.23.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/GtvoPl4.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.24.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/QeGgBWf.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/22aFbi3.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.24.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/piSQk20.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/alzT9AG.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.25.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/SaLLuBG.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/o4E02vw.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/ydo0jbh.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.25.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/HlmlbTz.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/bLhyMPH.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.26.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pwr1QwZ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.26.19 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Amazon.com, Inc. $1861.69 \n&gt; **Amazon.com, Inc.
