{"id": "d9y20q", "title": "Why I think EA will have a shit year", "selftext": "i'm thinking FIFA will have pretty bad sales this year, for multiple reasons:\n\n1. no big transfer in 2019: the previous years there were big transfers in the summer that make people excited to play their favorite teams. 2017 neymar mbappe lukaku 2018 ronaldo coutinho dembele. however one exception in 2016 when the only big transfer was pogba but FIFA 17 sales was still higher than expected, this could be explained by point 2\n\n2. 2019 is an odd number year, meaning no EURO or world cup. these tournaments usually increase the number of fans of the sport. FIFA 17 might've benefitted from EURO 2016 idk\n\n3. no new xbox or playstation consoles. the best selling console in 2019 is the nintendo switch/nintendo switch lite, and these consoles sell especially well in holiday season since they make nice little gifts. and these consoles don't boost sales of FIFA much, if at all\n\n4. FIFA 20 will have virtually no changes compared to 19: people usually think \"but it's FIFA it'll sell regardless\". yes, but that could be due to the other reasons listed above that boosted previous years' sales. it will most likely finally catch up to them this year when there's no other factor to carry the game's sales\n\nmy conclusion: inverse me and buy calls", "created_utc": 1569577558, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d9y20q/why_i_think_ea_will_have_a_shit_year/", "is_self": true}
