{"id": "g40tk5", "title": "My DD", "selftext": "I think some of the company that can bring SPX down re apple, facebook, and alphabet\n\nApple is kinda screwed since they\u2019re targeting rich people, or people that have money to spend on something \u2018exclusive and expensive\u2019... with this economic and spending downturn, I think the last thing in your mind will be buying apple stock, or the newest apple product, so they could be one big catalyst, although they did a dodge by launching newer iphone with lower profit margin to catch more poeple that just get the stimulus cheque... but I still dont think they will get the demand they want... \nEarning for Q2 - 30 April 2020, so that will be in 2 weeks, forecast $2.46\n\nFacebook... I dont even understand how facebook make profit lol, I know their platform get more user traction since now people spend time online, but then the revenue from ads most likely or will decline sharply \nTheir earning date is:\n04/29/2020 after market close\nThe forecast will be $1.78\n\nAlphabet... Well google is kinda diversify, so I think they would not get beaten so badly, but hey, some people here commented about their earning decline from the ads of the travel company, and YT thing, so I guess that\u2019s one part of it, \nThey also freeze hiring, so that\u2019s kinda concerning if that means anything lol\nEarning at 5/4/2020, maybe wrong since it was based on algorithm, so lets see...\nForecast : $11.27\n\n\nMsft, crazy they almost went back to their ATH, their cloud computing is pretty decent tho, so I would not expect them to drive the market down, although maybe some sales on some aspect will decline...\nEarning 4/29/2020 after close, forecast $1.28\n\nAmazon reach their ATH during economic crisis, that\u2019s new and interesting, their earning date is 4/23/2020 based on algorithm 4/30 according to market insider... the forecase is $6.34 \n\nSeems like this coming two weeks is the crunch time, if their earning miss the targets, then walah, welcome to the second leg ride\n\nOn the other hand lets see netflix, stupid high valuation with non diversified investment... earning on 4/21/2020 after market close with forecast of $1.62\nCould this be the biggest bubble that will burst soon?\n\n\nSo my take, looking at the stupid amount of put at flowalgo, spy will retract back to $180-185 area after they\u2019re up to $190 ish since there\u2019re some calls due on the 22nd, then they will trade sideway, maybe downward after Netflix Earning after market close... since a lot of people will close their position after the earning report, then we will go sideway again this week, maybe dip here and there, expect range like last week, and then close high or around the same value this week, maybe lower, and next next week is the big boys earning.... to be continued", "created_utc": 1587267216.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g40tk5/my_dd/", "is_self": true}
