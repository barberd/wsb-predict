Uber cut down few more Engineers last week.\n\n\nUbers only solution is to go fully autonomous to achieve profitability, which is 5 to 10 years away and very much likely **WAYMO OR TESLA WILL HAVE ITS OWN FLEET OF AUTONOMOUS CARS** even before Uber. There won't be any use of just a app. Both TESLA &amp; GOOGLE want their own Taxi service, won't sell to Uber. \n\nWAYMO running 600 l4/l5 fully autonomous/driverless cars/taxi in Arizona. They will soon introduce their own fleet of autonomous taxis all over US before Uber.\n\nShort UBER and LYFT. Don't fall for this cheap market manipulation.\n\nLong #MSFT, #TESLA, #GOOGLE (WAYMO)", "created_utc": 1581134150, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f0m7ez/uber_69_billion_valuations_89_billion_yearly_loss/", "is_self": true}
