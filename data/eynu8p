TSLA is singlehandedly putting the strapon over the strapon and fucking the everliving fuck out of the electric car industry and NIO is an electric car company. Not only that but NIO is a chinese based company that deals in electric car, I will let that speak for itself in this current climate. They also lost out on technology needed that Tesla bought, not only that but they are so close to solvency they can taste it on elon's musky ballsack, they have continuously lost money (and I mean a lot) and are down to their last 200 million. \n\nSo with all this how in the fuck have they gone from 3.54 to 4.08 last trading session, and why are they at 4.26 right now pre market. I am sensing a fat drop today or a huge spike and I have no clue but none of this is making sense unless one of you are going all stonks only go up on this because it makes no sense.", "created_utc": 1580810260, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eynu8p/which_one_of_you_donkeys_are_inflating_nio/", "is_self": true}
