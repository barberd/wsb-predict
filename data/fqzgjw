{"id": "fqzgjw", "title": "ROKU Puts", "selftext": "ROKU had a huge bounce during this past rally, almost 30%.For what fucking reason? None.\n\nThe truth is SPY is looking for my downside. Monday will be bloody and the VIX is going to moon again (I'm not saying VIX calls its too easy to get fucked there)\n\nSo as SPY looks for more downside the stocks that tumbled the first time will again. And one of the biggest bouncers/illiquid stocks is Roku. Not to mention if we do end up setting a new low I assume most tech boomers who are stuck bag-holding will capitulate.\n\nIn power hour Monday I'm going to be looking for May 8th 65P. At Friday they were 3.47 a contract.\n\nProfit potential is around 2.5x given VIX remains the same.\n\nGood luck retards\n\nEdit: Here's a chart stop whining and telling me this thing doesn't look like the Titanic\n\n[https://imgur.com/C49tDwf](https://imgur.com/C49tDwf)\n\nEdit 2: Don't mix streaming services with Roku. Roku is a device that needs to be purchased in order to make $$$", "created_utc": 1585454546.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqzgjw/roku_puts/", "is_self": true}
