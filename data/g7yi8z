{"id": "g7yi8z", "title": "Boeing cancels $4.2 billion Embraer deal, get ready for $100 BA by week's end", "selftext": "Last week I would have said that Boeing would probably have a successful test of the previous initial support at $120. Now with the news today terminating the merger agreement, I'd say it's likely $120 fails support. $100 is a nice round figure, and maybe new support forms there. However it's more likely $100 will fail and a retest of the previous low around $90 may come into play in early May. With the weak performance of the stock on Friday, it seems as if the smart money already knew about the failed merger deal.\n\nWhat's even worse, news just came out a few hours ago that Embraer said Boeing \"wrongfully terminated\" the 4.2 billion dollar deal, and vowed to pursue all remedies against Boeing for the damages incurred. Not only does this news exacerbate and already bad financial situation for Boeing, it's also a PR nightmare.\n\nPosition: BA $100p 5/1 expiration", "created_utc": 1587839112.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7yi8z/boeing_cancels_42_billion_embraer_deal_get_ready/", "is_self": true}
