{"id": "guubk0", "title": "Pfizer DD", "selftext": "TLDR:  9/18 PFE 44c\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrent Positions: 6/19  35.5, 37c\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPFE dropped 7.15% today after announcing that its drug Ibrance failed to make a significant difference in early stage treatment of breast cancer.  While this is a major setback for the company and Ibrance is a big moneymaker, I think the more important thing to focus on is the fact that they are a leading candidate for developing a COVID vaccine.  Their CEO announced today that he expects to have a vaccine ready by October 2020.  [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/drugmakers-focus-coronavirus-vaccine-2020-114711773.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/drugmakers-focus-coronavirus-vaccine-2020-114711773.html).   We have all seen the pops that Gilead has had.  All it will take is one rumor of a potentially effective trial for PFE to blow up.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs far as technicals go, its currently sitting at $35.46.  This region between 34.50-35 has been a support level multiple times since 2017.  It briefly broke 35 today, but rebounded quickly and slowly climbed back up to 35.50.  Level 2 data shows some serious buying support at 35 as well.  The hourly RSI is right below 30, and the 30 minute MACD is about to have a bullish cross.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf they can show positive data for a COVID vaccine, or even if theres an overblown rumor, I see no reason why the stock couldn't revisit the December 2018 level of 46$ or more.  The best part is the price and IV of the calls.  IV is currently 25.3% for September 18 calls, and the $44 contracts are only $0.14.  You could definitely go with a lower strike, the $40 are $0.50.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am an absolute retard and currently have a losing record, but this seems like an absolutely ideal entry and could turn out to be a 10+ bagger at some point this summer.
