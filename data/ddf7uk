{"id": "ddf7uk", "title": "Pumpkin Spice ETF", "selftext": "October is shaping up to be a rough month.  We've got basically shit apples all over the globe, from the China / Hong Kong thing, European debt crisis, Brexit, basically all of South America is fucked with Venezuela/Argentina and now Peru having their own massive crisis, Hindu nationalism creating a potential nuclear war while at the same time they can't even land a simple lander on the moon, North Korean subs with missiles, and now even the USA which was doing fine has this whole thing I'm not going to mention because politics are not allowed in WSB and I want to respect that rule.\n\nTons of bad economic news coming out this week...blah, blah yadda yadda...I could go on.\n\nSo where do some of our cocaine-infused bulls throw their hard earned cash in times like this when it seems like everything is going down including your mom?\n\nPumpkin Spice.  Basically we've seen a consistent YoY uptrend of pumpkin spice bullshit since around 2010, however we had a slight downtrend last year\n\nhttps://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;geo=US&amp;q=pumpkin%20spice\n\nSo I'm guessing that any earnings estimates taking pumpkin spice sales into accounts are expecting another down year, yet if consumer sentiment is down, and people feel sad and start losing their jobs, they may actually be more likely to buy pumpkin spice, so earnings could be undervalued.  Also we can already see a slight uptick in Google searches hinting at this maybe being true.\n\nAt the same time, all pumpkin spice is, is cinnamon and cloves and some other bullshit, there aren't even pumpkins in it at all, costs should remain fixed.  So here it is, I present to you, the recession-proof, pumpkin spice index fund:\n\n$SBUX - Starbucks - earnings 11/7/2019\n$KDP - Keurig Dr Pepper, has pumpkin spice keurigs now, 11/6/2019\n$DNKN - Dunkin Doughnuts - earnings 10/24/2019\n$GIS - General Mills - pumpkin spice kellogs frosted flakes - 12/18/2019\n$EIDO - ISHARES TR/MSCI INDONESIA ETF - Indonesia grows 70% of the world's cloves.\n\nI'm thinking we're going to see a huge fucking pumpkin spice year this year because people are depressed.  This is a way to profit off of other's misery.\n\nAnything else you care to add, please list below...", "created_utc": 1570230889, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ddf7uk/pumpkin_spice_etf/", "is_self": true}
