Small Excerpt:\n\n\u201cIn the wake of that crisis, governments themselves have become highly indebted, requiring virtually continuous support from central banks to acquire that debt to maintain low interest rates to support growth. The average ratio of government debt to GDP for G-7 economies reached 117% in 2019, up from 81% in 2007. Any attempt to taper or reverse the accumulation of government debt or other assets is quickly reversed as financial markets become unruly and economies slow.\n\nNow faced with the exogenous shock of the COVID-19 pandemic, policymakers are returning to the same tools employed in the financial crisis a decade ago. They are desperately searching for programs that will fill the demand gap created by massive shutdowns and travel restrictions while simultaneously finding ways to prop up businesses that to a large degree are overly indebted as a result of artificially low interest rates from the past decade.\n\nThe ultimate policy goal is to stabilize the economy by salvaging industries that will need to provide employment when the pandemic ends. Given the high level of leverage in these companies, any gaps in cashflow will make it impossible for many companies to service their debt. *The total debt of U.S. non-financial businesses has grown by about $6 trillion since 2007, while cash on hand has only grown by $1.7 trillion. A big driver of that debt growth has been buying back stock.*\n\nLending these companies more money will only compound the long run problem resulting from over-leverage and make the companies even more vulnerable to failure in the long run.\n\nWe are experiencing the end game of the great debt super cycle. As the private sector has become increasingly over-levered, the baton is being passed to the public sector where resources are so strained that the printing press has become the last resort.\u201d\n\nTL;DR: read the title, also italics \n\nFull article [Op-Ed: Growth of government, corporate debt a Faustian bargain](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/27/op-ed-growth-of-government-corporate-debt-a-faustian-bargain.html)", "created_utc": 1585346336.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fq6tol/we_are_experiencing_the_end_game_of_the_great/", "is_self": true}
