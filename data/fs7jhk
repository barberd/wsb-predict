That's a dildo aimed straight at your un-lubed ass.\n\nIf you think those OTM puts you bought are gonna print, think again. You know, those puts you poured you min wage check into when the market had already tanked and IV was at it's maximum....SMH\n\nEvery dip from now on will be somewhat bought up. Even if we see further decline in the coming months, it won't be a crash type money printing move like that from earlier in the month. Itll be a slow decline at best.\n\nSo you either got IV raping you, or the FED or cashed up boomers who just learned how to use google. Take your pick and just enjoy it. Either way you're going to be crushed harder than the last 20 Christmas's when you thought your daddy might finally show up.\n\nEdit: \nYou autists failed to get the point of this tongue in cheek post. You all FOMO'd yourselves into a super high risk, low reward position. Theta will kill your position even if you're right. You've already felt that in the past week. Buying puts after a massive drop with IV at its peak was plain dumb. If you bought today, after we've rallied back and IV contracted somewhat then that would be an ok play given the uncertainty. \n\nAlso, just because I'm having a go at you gay bears, doesn't make me a bull either. You know there are many, many ways to play options other than simply buying long calls / puts and hoping.", "created_utc": 1585634449.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fs7jhk/bad_news_for_you_gay_bears/", "is_self": true}
