{"id": "fcxup8", "title": "Urban Outfitters (URBN) 3/3/2020 AMC - Has Becky truly left the building?", "selftext": "Stock: **Urban Outfitters (URBN) - 23.33$**\n\nDirection: **Neutral Bearish**\n\n**Price Target:** **23$**\n\n**Type: Call Credit Spread**\n\n**Fundamental:** Urban Outfitters has a great low PE and strong margins. Recently, it\u2019s debt levels exploded and cash-on-hand are dwindling. This paints a mixed picture of a company trying to transition through growing expenses. While last quarter and Jan sales guidance were lackluster, some of its non-core brands are performing quite well in their respective niches. Outside of macro issues, a key focus will be Nuuly, its digital experience.\n\n**Technical**: Priced below 20, 50, 200 day moving average. MACD shows bullish neutral. RSI shows around 35, oversold. Options sentiments are very bearish in volume and very bearish open interest. Implied movement is 9.8% or about 2.30$ Short interest is at 8%, with 6.1 days to cover.\n\n**Sentimental**: There are several macro headwinds that plague all of the retail sector, especially on their forward guidance. In addition, there may have been massive Adspend and development costs that will be factored into the earnings. Urban Outfitter\u2019s incredible margin is a bright spot in this muddy analysis. In addition, we will be updated on the performance of Nuuly and see if there are incremental gains and updated progress towards a digital transformation. I think the main bull thesis is the \u201clight in the darkness\u201d potential. If URBN beats really hard and everything else is red, there is a chance that traders flock over. However, any negativity or weakness will be exposed and drive stock prices down. \n\n**Robinhood (3/3/2020) Fucky. Not using.**\n\n**Sell - 3/13/2020 24 call**\n\n**Buy - 3/13/2020 26 call**\n\n**Urban outfitters is a declining company that is on the cusp of great value purchase. If they can prove the turnaround this quarter, it may be wise to buy. However, given that the market is on sale, I believe people will flock to other stocks even in the event of an URBN beat.**", "created_utc": 1583255845.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fcxup8/urban_outfitters_urbn_332020_amc_has_becky_truly/", "is_self": true}
