Still cheap so load up.\n\nFMCI: Plant based food. Unnamed company right now and already up some, still room to run IMO.\n\nGPAQ: Football Hall of Fame. James Dolan set up this group. Knicks are terrible but he knows how to make $.\n\nPositions: A metric fuckton of SPAC warrants\n\nHello Autists. I can\u2019t put SPAC tickers in this bc automod blocks all sub $7B market caps now. QUIT BANNING THAT SHIT.\n\nI will be sounding out the tickers so I\u2019m not blocked. Fuck you automod.\n\nI was the guy who called a certain plant based food co at $0.90, and tried to post about the Burgerfi merger at $1.00. Sadly automod kept getting me. Everyone is stuck buying calls and stocks but missing the top money maker: SPAC warrants.\n\nSPACs are hot right now and everyone wants to find the next VTIQ/NKLA or DEAC/DKNG. Eff Em See Eye is going to print, along with GeePack and Oh Pee Ee Ess. Personally I have 11,000 warrants in various companies.\n\nMoney is pouring into these plays right now. Even with SPY down today most of my warrants were up 20%+. Yeah it\u2019s not options, but they provide the same leverage on speculative companies but with much longer time horizons. \n\nI\u2019ve gone $6k to $21k in 3 weeks riding the SPAC wave, and will continue to do so.\n\nEff Em See Eye, Oh Pee Ee Ess and Gee Pee Aa Que should all be profitable over the next month. There are other sleepers that will gain traction in the coming weeks. There is a ton of money in warrants, don\u2019t miss out.", "created_utc": 1591849778.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h0s1p4/if_stocks_only_go_up_spacs_defy_gravity/", "is_self": true}
