Here are the first few lines:\n\n* Outpatient testing must not be encouraged, promoted or advertised.\n* Persons with COVID-like illness not requiring hospitalization should be instructed to stay home. It is safer for the patients and health care workers and testing does not currently change clinical management or recommendations about staying home.\n* Hospital systems may create alternate testing venues to offload their emergency\ndepartments.\n* This minimizes risk of transmission to others, especially healthcare workers (HCWs)\n* There is a national shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), collection swabs,\nand viral transport media supplies and it is critical that laboratory testing be prioritized\nfor hospitalized patients\n* There is no reason to test asymptomatic persons or mild-to-moderately ill persons who\nare not hospitalized, including HCW or first responders\n* Testing may play a more significant role after the pandemic has peaked\n\nLater in the document:\n\n> To preserve PPE for HCW providing medically necessary care for hospitalized patients, the NYC Health Department is directing healthcare facilities to IMMEDIATELY STOP TESTING NON-HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS FOR COVID-19 unless test results will impact the clinical management of the patient. In addition, do not test asymptomatic people, including HCWs or first responders. COVID-19 testing is only indicated for HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS.\n\nYou can find the whole document here: https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/han/advisory/2020/covid-19-03202020.pdf\n\nBasically confirmed cases are only the number of the absolute WORST cases.\n\nedit: specifically, I work for a tech company that provides healthcare.
