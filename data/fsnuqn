As soon as they start **broad testing, get CASH GANG**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1) Introduction\n\nLet me explain.\n\nSomething that has not been discussed a lot from what I hear on discord/read in the sub: **antibody** testing. Yeah I get, shit is bad and world will collapse and so on but hear me out - the permabulls will take any major positive news for a good 10% rally. \n\nAntibody testing is already done in New York and testing capacities are about to be expanded:\n\n[https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037713v1](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037713v1)\n\nAdditionally the head of the Charit\u00e8  - most reputable medical institution in Germany - announced that there will be anti-body testing of big groups in **around 2 weeks.**\n\nSource (GERMAN - ENG sub):  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GNhq1LHhQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GNhq1LHhQ)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) Conclusion\n\nWhile we are riding into an economic armageddon, we still wanna ride the waves up and down. After we will get a big downie from SPY being rejected at 263, we will still see a **massive rally** at the time when **antibody tests are shown to be effective in just a single country** because it will most likely be the same data for all the other countries. I can only give a timeframe, which would be somewhere between  **4/14-21**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3) Side-takeaway:\n\nEveryone who is doing \"diamond\" hands - if you don\u00b4t have leaps, you should probably switch to trading with the trend/go more Cash because while we will get a lot of bad news - there will also be very promising good news soon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust my 2 cents, go ahead and flame or whatever you wanna do.
