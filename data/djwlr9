I haven't seen GPU's and CPU's sell out this fast since mining craze in 2016.\n\nThis quarter, AMD released 2 huge market share eaters:\n\n* 5700 and 5700 xt gpus\n\n* Zen 2 series\n\n5700 series gpus are eating market share from Nvidia, but not as aggressively as Zen 2 generation CPUs have been absolutely demolishing Intel. There is a competing CPU for pretty much every mid/high range CPU Intel has released. If you compare Intel and AMD there is almost a reversal in trends.\n\nBoth of these (CPU and GPU) are far superior for the price to performance ratio in the PC market. Scalpers have been buying up the CPU's and reselling on ebay at a higher price because that's how in demand these CPU's are. There has not been actual sales or deals on these CPU's other than things that are done through the platform selling the product (like Google first time purchase), and still these things sell out in minutes every time at full price.\n\nAdditionally, I took a look at the price history, and although i know fractals are usually bullshit, just for fun:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/b9QN76g.png\n\nMy positions - this is actually the last of my liquidity as I'm trying to close on a house with the remainder of my money:\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/W7ixnqD.png", "created_utc": 1571445754, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/djwlr9/i_believe_amd_will_take_off_to_40_nearpost/", "is_self": true}
