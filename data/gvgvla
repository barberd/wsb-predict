This is unhealthy and will impede economic recovery if we reach that point. It will be \"The emperor's new cloths\" moment because while recoveries up to this point could be pretended to be \"anticipating reopenings\" or other bullshit, we're getting to the point where there are no more excuses and everyone realizes the Fed went too far. \n\nIf the news become \"market reach all time highs during a pandemic because printer go brrr\", this will look very negative for both Trump and Powell. They will try to avoid this just as much as they try to avoid a crash. \n\nI think Powell already started to suspect he went too far, and his last speech already generated a huge selloff. I think it's just a matter of time until he announces stopping QE, and the response is going to be unprecedented. There's a reason the financial system dread his speeches, it's because it's expecting him to backtrack. He said himself that this was an \"act fast and deal with it later scenario\" and the \"deal with it later\" is about to happen.\n\nSo watch out for announcements of Powell. At this point even an announcement about an announcement can bring this brittle market down. \n\nPosition: monitoring Powell's announcements. Will buy TVIX the moment he announces an announcement. Expecting historical selloff to happen as a result of his announcement. Nothing else will bring this down, and sideways is just not an option with so much liquidity leaking from the printer.\n\nTL;DR Printer will have to shut down soon, market will go cold turkey like a heroin junky. Bulls will be betrayed and stabbed in the back by their idol.", "created_utc": 1591135189.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gvgvla/its_going_to_be_the_fed_to_bring_this_house_of/", "is_self": true}
