{"id": "cghywj", "title": "Finding the meaning of YOLO.", "selftext": "Whether or not something is a yolo is dependent on each person. There is no one true definition of a YOLO and there are a few variables that come into play which all need each other. \n\n Position, net worth, volatility.\n\nPosition - Your play, more specifically, how much you put into a play. Important if the play is more volatile, however this means nothing if it isn\u2019t a large percent of your net worth or AT LEAST your investment account.\n\nNet Worth - Total cash value of assets. The YOLOness of your position is dependent on this factor, as well as-\n\nVolatility - How likely your position is to fluctuate up or down.\n\nSome examples:\n\nRoger has a $1,000 WeBull account. Other than his WeBull account, he has $300 sitting in his bank account. Roger has autistically decided to put his entire $1000 into Netflix FD calls. Rogers **Position** is 77% of his **Net Worth** and his position is **Volatile**. Upon losing his entire investment, which he most certainly will, Roger will have effectively wiped out over half of his net worth. Roger has YOLO\u2019d, however nobody cares because Roger is a poor.\n\nJasmine has a $10,000 Think or Swim account. Other than her ToS account, she has only $1,000 saved up in an Ally\u2122\ufe0f High-Yield\u2122\ufe0f Savings\u2122\ufe0f account earning 2%\u2122\ufe0f interest. Jasmine has high functioning autistically decided to put her entire ToS account into a mix of long dated Microsoft calls, and shares. Jasmine\u2019s **Position** is 91% of her ***Net Worth**, however her position has little **Volatility**. Jasmine may have YOLO\u2019d on terms looser than her taco, but her investment is relatively safe, so nobody cares.\n\nChad B. Turner (the B stands for big long swinging retarded dick) has $5,000,000 of his parents allowance in an eTrade account. And his dad said if he can turn that $5,000,000 into $5,000,000.01 he\u2019ll buy him a new Lambo. Other than his eTrade, he has some play money and a Ferrari, and is sure to inherit his parents multi-million dollar fortune, along with his fathers penthouse full of whores frothing at the mouth for his cock. And I\u2019m telling you, these girls will do ~anything~. Like, you don\u2019t understand, if you tell her to get on her knees and shove a live snake...ah I\u2019m getting off track. Anyway, Chad decides making this money in a smart effective manner isn\u2019t worth his time and dumps $500,000 into Netflix calls before earnings, because he watched Netflix one time while your girlfriend was giving him sloptop and while the head wasn\u2019t very good, he could at least focus on Jennifer Aniston\u2019s nipples on Friends, eventually bringing him to orgasm. Chad B. Turner\u2019s **Position** has a high **Volatility**, however it is only .2% of his **Net Worth** which means this is indeed not a YOLO for Chad. Chad takes a screenshot of his positions and posts to WSB.\n\nLast but not least, we have you. You have $20,000 in a Robinhood account, and besides that you only have your last paycheck sitting in a .01% interest checking account. You\u2019ve just logged onto WSB and saw Chad B. Turners post. \u201cHOLY SHIT WHAT A YOLO\u201d, you exclaim and get to thinking. For this man to put 500k on Netflix uppies, he\u2019s gotta know what he\u2019s doing, or has some kind of insider info, right? I mean, hey, he has more money than I do I better get in on this! So you log into your Robinhood, sell your $MU and $USO FD\u2019s for a small loss and go all in on Netflix greens. Your dick instantly gets hard thinking about how you and your new WSB partner will share in glorious tenderloins. You leave a comment, \u201cI\u2019m all in as well!See you on the other side.\u201d You, the chosen one, have hit the trifecta. You\u2019ve got the position, you don\u2019t have the Net Worth but god damnit do you have the volatility. \n\nThe time has come. Netflix reports their earnings, and you get a nice little notification at the top of your screen. \u201cNFLX announced quarterly earnings of $0.60 per share, beating expectations by 7%.\u201d \u201cFuck yeah, beat earnings holy shit I\u2019m gonna be so rich.\u201d You log in, fumbling to type in your password several times in excitement before telling yourself to calm down. You slowly type, 1-2-3-4-5-6....\u201cYo what the FUCK?!?\u201d Netflix is down 10%...11%, you tell yourself it\u2019s just a fat finger and it\u2019ll come up with guidance. A CNN news snippet appears, \u201cNetflix stock plummets after massive subscriber miss.\u201d It\u2019s still going down, you realize this is it and panic sell to save the last scraps of your investment.\n\nMeanwhile Chad B. Turner has just recently returned from his trip to the Bahamas with some of the girls his father lent him. \n\n\u201cSo, son, how\u2019s that investment coming?\u201d \n\nHe\u2019s completely forgotten from all the sex. He logs in and hangs his head in shame. \n\n\u201cSorry, dad, looks like I lost $450,000.\u201d\n\nHis father smiles. \u201cCheer up, son. Hey, the important thing is that you did your due diligence and you went with your gut and took a chance. That shows courage. But sometimes, things don\u2019t work out the way we plan and we have to deal with the consequences.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand, dad.\u201d he says solemnly. \n\n\u201cSo, hey, we\u2019ll table the Lamborghini for now but how does that new corvette sound?\u201d\n\n\u201cGee whiz no foolin? Thanks dad!\u201d\n\nChecking back in with you now, it seems like you\u2019ve decided to spend the last of your investment on $ROPE. But, rest assured, your girlfriend is in good hands.", "created_utc": 1563824681, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cghywj/finding_the_meaning_of_yolo/", "is_self": true}
