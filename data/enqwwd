You just need to prove you are SEC \"accredited\" investor that either makes $200,000 income a year or have $1m in assets. They then allow you to either invest in their angel fund, which is basically an invite only mutual fund with a $125,000 minimum investment in a basket of 200+ startups they pick. Or you can directly invest up to around $10,000 in a specific startup through an Angellist syndicate (fancy way of saying a group of investors who as a whole fund a couple hundred thousand for a startup's funding round).\n\nI ruled out the first option, the private mutual fund of startups, because 95% of the stuff in there seemed like hot garbage. Like mobile pizza ovens on wheels, coding schools in India, phone game developers, shit that is already out there and not innovative and low margin.\n\nSecond option is super intruiging, there's guys on there who got into Uber and Airbnb and Casper and Ring and Dollar Shave Club in their early rounds and walked away with millions. You get sent an invite to join a funding round every couple of weeks by a syndicate lead, who does as much vetting as he/she can, but again this is VC so it's murky af and you pretty much expect to lose every penny given the odds. Some syndicates fund rounds every other week, others do one a year, depends on who is leading it and what their investment objectives are.\n\nI haven't pulled the trigger yet on funding a round, almost every invite I get is for a startup I think is either a shit idea or poorly executed, I'll share when I do and will post updates.", "created_utc": 1578852554, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/enqwwd/are_angel_investorsventure_capitalists_autists/", "is_self": true}
