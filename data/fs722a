The price war is leading to oversupply and probably won\u2019t end soon. So you have a demand shock and a supply shock creating a perfect shit storm. It is not impossible for oil to fall into the single digits. There will be blood.**\n\nJust to get it out of the way: SPY $200p 4/24 and F $4p 4/17. I know, I\u2019m a fucking idiot.\n\nI\u2019ve been getting questions about oil trickling in since /u/fuzzyblankeet started writing his outstanding corporate debt threads and I wrote about it in one of them, so I figured I would give you guys a (short, but terribly long for you autists) primer on the oil and gas industry, demand destruction and the price war. TL;DR\u2019s will be provided in sections for the lazy or can\u2019t be bothered.\n\nI\u2019m not giving you trades because 1) you need to do your own DD on specific companies (I briefly looked at finances for Oxy and Devon in fuzzy\u2019s first thread if you want to go find that); fuzzy\u2019s suggestions are a good place to start, particularly for US shale companies 2) I\u2019m not an experienced options trader and you don\u2019t need me giving you full-retard plays. \n\nAs far as my background, my full-time job involves covering the news in the sector for an industry-specific data and analytics company. You have to pay more than pocket change to read my good stuff, but I'm several orders of magnitude less expensive than fuzzy. I mainly cover the Canadian and international upstream markets, but I have dabbled in the rest of it, including capital markets, and I understand the broad strokes of US shale.\n\n**Definitions**\n\n**TL;DR If you know nothing of the oil and gas industry, you may need a bit of a down-and-dirty glossary to get started. I wrote this first, so I may not use all the terms listed (and I certainly didn\u2019t list all the terms there are), but they are good to know anyways. Skip if you have at least a passing familiarity with the industry.** \n\n\u00b7 Upstream \u2013 Essentially exploration and production. These are the companies (or divisions of supermajors) that find the oil and gas and pull it out of the ground.\n\n\u00b7 Midstream \u2013 Transportation and storage. Moving produced oil and gas by pipeline, truck, ship, railcar, etc. and when needed, storing them.\n\n\u00b7 Downstream \u2013 Refineries and plants. These are the guys that turn unprocessed crude and gas into end-use or intermediate products.\n\n\u00b7 Oilfield Services \u2013 These are the companies that help upstream companies get their shit. They may shoot seismic to help find prospects, run land or offshore rigs to drill wells, build infrastructure, provide drilling fluids or other chemicals, and a whole host of other shit. \n\n\u00b7 Conventional \u2013 These wells are the traditional image of how oil and gas gets produced. You drill a well (mostly) straight down and you find a pocket of oil and/or gas or you don\u2019t. Good rock with high permeability and porosity. Most offshore production is conventional. It also typically has lower decline rates.\n\n\u00b7 Unconventional \u2013 This is essentially shale. Tight rock with low permeability and porosity. You drill down to the rock and then drill a lateral section, so you have as much pipe in the pay zone as possible. Then you use that evil fracking shit to break the rock up so oil and gas flow. These wells are often comparatively more expensive to drill, and the output declines quickly, so you have to constantly drill new wells if you want to maintain or grow production. Unconventional shale is what led to the US boom in production in recent years.\n\n\u00b7 Oilsands \u2013 Canada. This can either be mined to produce bitumen or extracted through things like steam-assisted gravity drainage (pump steam into ground to heat up the bitumen and make it less viscous). It has to be blended with diluent (very light oil or condensates) to move in pipelines and is processed into synthetic crude.\n\n\u00b7 Light vs Heavy oil \u2013 API gravity says how light or heavy oil is. High API is lighter, low API is heavier. One isn\u2019t necessarily better than the other, they have different uses. For example, heavy oil makes better fuel oil for ships. Sometimes oil can have high sulfur content, which is expensive but necessary to remove. \u201cSweet\u201d oil means low sulfur content. WTI and Brent are light crudes, a lot of Middle Eastern, Canadian and Venezuelan oil (as examples) is heavy.\n\n\u00b7 Condensate and Natural Gas Liquids \u2013 C2-C5+ (ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, etc.) found in some gas fields. Exist as liquids at ambient temperatures and often more valuable than the gas itself. \n\n\u00b7 Gas \u2013 Natural gas, not gasoline. Most oil fields have associated gas production, which may be flared (burned off) or reinjected into the reservoir to enhance recovery (keeps pressures higher so production doesn\u2019t decline as fast). \n\n\u00b7 LNG \u2013 Liquefied Natural Gas. If you\u2019re exporting gas overseas and can't use a pipeline, you send it to a terminal that makes it really fucking cold to liquefy it and then send it to export markets by ship, where it is turned back into gas.\n\n\u00b7 OPEC and OPEC+ - You all should have heard of the OPEC cartel, but OPEC+ was a group of non-member countries (Russia chief among them) that worked with OPEC to protect oil prices by reducing their output. That ended early in March and led to the price war.\n\n\u00b7 NOCs \u2013 National Oil Companies. Most producing countries have a state-owned oil company that will typically control large portions of the country\u2019s reserves or all of it; sometimes there are a few state-owned companies in one country. They\u2019ll also partner in assets outside of their country. Saudi Aramco in Saudi Arabia, Rosneft and Gazprom in Russia, Petrobras in Brazil, ONGC in India, Equinor in Norway, etc. The US, obviously, does not have a NOC. Not all NOCs are created equal. Pemex, Mexico\u2019s NOC, is a steaming pile of shit and the one of the most indebted companies in the world.\n\n\u00b7 Supermajors \u2013 There are five: ExxonMobil, Chevron, Royal Dutch Shell, BP and Total. Huge, valuable companies that have been around forever and will probably be around until the Sun swallows the Earth or we all kill each other. Even after we transition away from hydrocarbons as our energy source, these behemoths will adapt and endure.\n\n**Industry Background**\n\n**TL;DR Very brief history, skip if you don\u2019t care**\n\nThe oil and gas industry has always been more boom and bust than a lot of other sectors. The world wants exactly as much petroleum as it wants and not a drop more. When supply does not match demand, prices fluctuate widely. OPEC (essentially led by Saudi Arabia) was formed in 1960 and as of 2018, its 14 member countries control nearly half of global production and over three-quarters of proven reserves. Since the 1980s, the organization began setting production targets to protect oil prices and market share. This has led to a series of price wars, with the previous occurring in 2014-2016.\n\nUS oil production peaked in the 1970s and had been in steady decline until about 2009, when the shale revolution began. The early days were the wild west, with small independents springing up like weeds and spending years and billions focused on growth over returns. Oil output climbed to 8-9 MMbo/d in 2014 and was over 12 MMbo last year, making the US the largest producer in the world. \n\nThe price war in 2014 began when Saudi Arabia and OPEC moved to protect market share by allowing themselves to exceed their production quotas. The goal of the price war was to reign in US shale. US output fell from a peak of 9.5 MMbo/d to a low of 8.5 MMbo/d. However, companies were backstopped by an inflow of new capital from lenders, private equity and others under the promise of future returns. Oil prices dipped into the high $20/bbl range before the end of the war. The price war was ultimately abandoned by Saudi Arabia after King Salman was warned that the country would be bankrupt within three to four years if it continued and major economic reforms weren't implemented.\n\nIn the years since the 2014-2016 price war, consolidation has begun in the US shale patch. New capital is harder to come by and investors have shifted focus from continued growth to positive cash flow and returns. Smaller or over-levered companies have started folding or been bought out by larger, stronger competitors, including supermajors.\n\nIn order to curb oversupply issues and protect prices, OPEC+ (OPEC, Russia and ten other non-members) began curtailing production in 2017. Those original cuts have been extended and expanded multiple times, all the way through March 2020. The current cuts that expire Wednesday amount to 1.7 MMbo/d, or 2.1 MMbo/d when including voluntary reductions from Saudi Arabia.\n\n**Demand Destruction: Who needs oil when you are knocking back a cold bottle of beer flu**\n\n**TL;DR Oil demand could fall by 20 MMbo/d YOY at the peak. Bad for prices.**\n\nCovid-19 threw a wrench into oil markets, which should be painfully obvious. Industrial production in China\u2014one of Russia and Saudi Arabia\u2019s primary customers\u2014fell off a cliff. China is the largest energy consumer in the world and accounted for over 80% of global oil demand growth last year. Demand for transport fuels has also been pummeled with 3 billion people on lockdown and fewer goods moving around. As an example of how important that is, 70% of US petroleum consumption, or 14 MMbo/d, is used for transportation. Petroleum is also used for hundreds of intermediate and end-use products such as plastics, polyurethane and solvents, which aren't being made. Power generation is also important, but a fairly small slice of the pie, and I don\u2019t have time to get into electrical grids, baseload power and everything else it involves.\n\nIn early March, the IEA estimated oil demand this year would fall by 90,000 bo/d from 2019 to a total of about 100 MMbo/d, compared to its previous estimate of 825,000 bo/d of growth. This forecast was based on an assumption of 2.5 MMbo/d less demand in Q1 with a gradual rebound the rest of the year. At the time, its best case scenario was that oil demand would grow by 480,000 bo/d. In the worst case, demand would fall by 730,000 bo/d. \n\nThis was pretty bad, but far too rosy an outlook. Since then, numerous analysts have projected declines in demand ranging from 7 to 10 MMbo in Q2. Goldman Sachs and Vitol (world\u2019s largest independent oil trader) estimate oil demand could fall by 15-20 MMbo/d YOY at its peak. The IEA has since said much the same thing. Even if the price war ended tomorrow, it would be too late to avoid an oversupply issue, which I\u2019ll talk about later.\n\n**Price War: \u201cFuck US Shale\u201d -Putin probably, but in Russian**\n\n**TL;DR Saudi Arabia and Russia are fighting for market share, with the added benefit of knee-capping US Shale. Oversupply could be several million barrels per day. Both of them are equipped to draw this out. Even worse for prices.**\n\nSaudi Arabia and OPEC knew how bad the pandemic was going to be for oil prices, so they sought to extend and expand production cuts again in late February and early March. The cuts would have taken another 1.5 MMbo/d off the markets through 2020, for a total of 3.6 MMbo/d. The proposal required the approval of OPEC+ (mainly Russia), as the non-members would have been responsible for 500,000 bo/d of the cuts.\n\nRussia, as we all know, did not agree to the cuts. Their argument was that any production cuts were quickly replaced by growth in US shale oil production. Which is true, we\u2019ve added about 3 MMbo/d in the three years that OPEC+ has cut production by, at most, 2.1 MMbo/d. There have been reports that new sanctions against Rosneft regarding commercial relations with Venezuela were what ultimately caused Putin to tell his energy minister to reject the cuts.\n\nSaudi Arabia responded quickly. Russia rejected the deal on March 6, and by March 8 the Saudis cut their official selling prices and kicked off the war, leading to the March 9 oil route. In a bid to recover market share they lost in the previous war, Saudi Arabia cut prices for their flagship Arab Light crude by $8/bbl for northwest Europe in April\u2014directly challenging Russia\u2014setting a discount of $10.25/bbl under Brent, compared to a $2/bbl discount for Russia\u2019s Urals blend. The Saudis also reduced their prices to Asia and the US by $6-7/bbl.\n\nBeyond prices, Saudi Arabia promised to increase production to 10 MMbo/d from their current 9.7 MMbo/d, once the existing OPEC+ production cuts fell off on April 1. Since then, they have doubled down and said they would increase production to 12.3 MMbo/d and begin increasing capacity to 13 MMbo/d. Now, it is estimated that 12 MMbo/d is the Saudi\u2019s current production capacity, meaning they would have to dip into their stored reserves and couldn\u2019t maintain 12.3 forever.\n\nThe UAE, primarily Abu Dhabi\u2019s ADNOC, said they would increase production by 1 MMbo/d. Russia promised to increase their production by 300,000 bo/d. The other 12 members of OPEC and 10 non-member countries of OPEC+ also have no reason to hold back anymore. This won\u2019t happen overnight on April 1, but you still have promises to add something like 3.5-4 MMbo/d to a market that doesn\u2019t need it, which is a nightmare in the best of times.\n\nUnlike previous price wars, which were started by Saudi Arabia to protect market share, Russia started this one for geopolitical and economic reasons. Putin pulled the trigger, and he is obviously not some replaceable energy minister, so this will go on as long as he wants or until everyone else capitulates. Russia is also far less reliant on oil revenue than Saudi Arabia. \n\nAccording to the IMF, Russia needs $42/bbl to balance its budget, compared to $82/bbl for the Saudis. Oil and gas revenue account for 1/3 of Russia\u2019s budget and about half its exports, compared to 80% and 2/3 for Saudi Arabia. Russia has also said it could withstand $25-30/bbl for 6-10 years (remember SA ended the 2014-16 war because they were going to be bankrupt in 3-4). Saudi Arabia\u2019s advantage is that they have the cheapest production costs in the world, at $2.80/bbl. Their budget requires $82/bbl because they are using the revenues to try to diversify their economy, which they can also put on the back burner.\n\nTo quote analyst Vincent Lauerman, \u201cIf oil consumption was to decline by a conservative 2.5 million bbls/d this year, oil production by Saudi Arabia, UAE and Russia was to increase by 2.57 million bbls/d on an annualized basis, and given the initial 1.65 million bbls/d surplus forecasted by OPEC, global oil supply would exceed consumption by an insane 7.88 million bbls/d in 2020. In the heart of the previous three oil price wars, global oil supply exceeded consumption by no more than 1.76 million bbls/d, in 1998.\u201d\n\nHe went on to say that the surplus won\u2019t be that high, for several reasons, which will be explained next. But it\u2019s a good summation of how impactful a price war during a pandemic is.\n\n**Impacts on Industry: We\u2019re all fucked (by popular request)**\n\n**TL;DR WTI oil prices could fall to $10/bbl or even single digits. Shale companies are fucked, OFS companies are fucked, downstream companies may be fucked. Midstream companies may actually be ok.**\n\nThe most obvious impact are oil prices. WTI briefly hit its lowest price since 2002 once already since March 9 and again today, when it fell below $20/bbl. WCS (Canadian benchmark) costs less to buy\u2014about $8-9/bbl\u2014than it does to ship it. I won\u2019t spend much time on Canada, they\u2019ve been fucked since 2016 as they don\u2019t have enough takeaway capacity and too much regulatory uncertainty, and now they\u2019re just a gaping, bloody mess. But the prices aren\u2019t stopping here. With the massive oversupply that is coming and limited storage, many analysts are forecasting prices as low as $10/bbl or even single digits if the price war and pandemic are drawn out.\n\nSeveral US shale basins were marginally economic to begin with (remember unconventional wells are expensive), and with prices falling so far they are entirely uneconomic. Almost every company, although not all of them, have cut capital expenditures (and sometimes dividends and executive/employee pay) to reduce their cash outflows. Remember, new capital saved shale in the last war, but it isn\u2019t happening this time. Shale is no longer in the good graces of lenders it enjoyed in previous years. \n\nThe companies will be able to prop up production for a while with DUC inventories, which are wells that were drilled but uncompleted, meaning they can be brought on stream for relatively small amounts of capex. But eventually those will run out, and uneconomic production will be shut in regardless. Russia (Putin) is actually likely to get what they want, at least for a while, as independent producers in the US who don\u2019t have the state backing of a NOC will let production decline to try to survive.\n\nMany producers, including US shale companies, have been hedging their production in recent years to protect against low oil prices. Many of them also used three-way collars to do it. An example of a three-way collar would be buying a put at $45/bbl, then selling a call at $55/bbl and another put at $35/bbl to offset premiums. They\u2019re fine between $45-$55\u2014or whatever they expected oil's price range to be\u2014and protected from $35-$45, but once it falls below that, the put they sold wipes out any gains from the one they bought and then some. Some, like Devon, used costless collars and swaps to hedge, so their positions will be fine (Devon\u2019s position is worth about $800MM right now). And a few, like Continental, didn\u2019t hedge at all, so they get to take $20 or $10/bbl right in the nuts.\n\nStorage is also finite and quickly running out, which is and will further depress prices. The Texas Railroad Commission (regulates O&G in Texas) said some pipeline operators have issued warnings to producers to reduce production because storage is filling up. Midstream companies, I think, will actually weather this storm fairly well. Pipelines are typically anchored by long-term firm service (take-or-pay) contracts, and as storage becomes more scarce it becomes more expensive. Enbridge, a Canadian midstream company that is North America\u2019s largest, has already said it is in a strong position to get through this.\n\nOilfield services companies are particularly vulnerable. Unlike producers and midstream companies, their product is their work. If they don\u2019t have work, they don\u2019t have cash flow, whereas the others can sit on their thumbs and the oil and gas provides cash flow. Halliburton has reduced hours for 3,500 employees in Houston, as an example. And Aker Solutions and some other OFS companies that operate in the North Sea have issued layoff warnings to all of their employees and sent foreign contractors home. Downstream companies are also being affected, as refineries are preparing for run cuts (falling demand, no one wants what they are selling) and slowing deliveries (they\u2019re onsite storage is running out too). \n\nOnce all this blows over, oil and gas will recover. Again, it won\u2019t be overnight. Production will have to be cut across the industry until demand recovers (probably next year will be ok). They will have to wait for storage levels to fall too before prices will recover fully. There will be bankruptcies during and a wave of consolidation after.\n\nAs an aside, the adminstration\u2019s promise to buy 77 MMbo for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is a crock of shit. The SPR is already 90% full, and 77 MMbo, if they can even buy that much, is a drop in the proverbial bucket. It would accomplish nothing and will not protect oil prices or US companies at all.\n\n**So what do we do with this asshole?**\n\n**TL;DR I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m a dumbass and I only know about oil and gas, but I can\u2019t directly participate in energy markets. Figure it out for yourself.**\n\nAgain, I\u2019m not doing DD for you on specific companies, that\u2019s on you. As I said before, /u/fuzzyblankeet threads are a good place to start, and I did talk about Devon and Oxy a bit in his first thread. A lot of US shale companies have debt up to their eyeballs, much of it bad. I\u2019m restricted by my company from participating directly in energy markets, so I haven\u2019t looked as closely at companies as I have in other sectors, other than for those I\u2019m writing about for work (and 75% of what I write is focused specifically on E&P operations).\n\nIt should already be priced in, but I think there may be some more movement on April 1 when the OPEC+ cuts fall off and a deal hasn\u2019t been reached (they aren\u2019t even talking, it\u2019s not going to happen). Saudi Arabia can turn on the taps quickly from 9.7 MMbo/d, as their current production capacity is estimated at 12 MMbo/d, but by and large the increases in output will take weeks or months to materialize. This will be offset to some extent by falling production among independent producers all over the world, but it won\u2019t be enough.\n\nUpstream US company stocks are sure to go lower, especially if WTI goes to $10/bbl or below, and some of them will go bankrupt. Might be a good opportunity to buy in for them sweet dividends (when they come back), but also carries a risk. \n\n**Some of my sources for the specifics (not all, some are paywalled, some are from work)**\n\n[https://www.opec.org/opec\\_web/en/press\\_room/5797.htm](https://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/press_room/5797.htm)\n\n[https://www.iea.org/news/global-oil-demand-to-decline-in-2020-as-coronavirus-weighs-heavily-on-markets](https://www.iea.org/news/global-oil-demand-to-decline-in-2020-as-coronavirus-weighs-heavily-on-markets)\n\n[https://www.upstreamonline.com/production/brace-for-the-carnage-oil-hits-18-year-low-on-demand-collapse-and-flood-of-supplies/2-1-783812](https://www.upstreamonline.com/production/brace-for-the-carnage-oil-hits-18-year-low-on-demand-collapse-and-flood-of-supplies/2-1-783812)\n\n[https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/oil-and-petroleum-products/use-of-oil.php](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/oil-and-petroleum-products/use-of-oil.php)\n\n[https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Goldman-Sachs-Prepare-For-A-Massive-Oil-Demand-Shock.html](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Goldman-Sachs-Prepare-For-A-Massive-Oil-Demand-Shock.html)\n\n[https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/IEA-Boss-Warns-Demand-Will-Plunge-By-20-Million-Barrels-Per-Day.html](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/IEA-Boss-Warns-Demand-Will-Plunge-By-20-Million-Barrels-Per-Day.html)\n\n[https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Pipeline-Operators-Un-Texas-Urge-Producers-To-Stop-Pumping.html](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Pipeline-Operators-Un-Texas-Urge-Producers-To-Stop-Pumping.html)", "created_utc": 1585632026.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fs722a/primer_on_the_oil_and_gas_industry_demand/", "is_self": true}
