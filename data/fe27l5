I use TD and for some fucking reason it never seems to get the sell price set correctly and I always have to manually make sure it's correct. I noticed it after I was cucked out of $70 because for some fucking reason it made my order sell an option for $40 instead of the $110 it was worth. RH's reliability may suck ass, but their UI is top notch and I miss it dearly.\n\nEdit: So apparently I did what is called a limit order rather than a market order. Still does not make any sense that TD would automatically set the limit sell price so low sometimes. I used TD like 2 years ago before switching to RH for commission free trading and I don't really remember this happening in the past.\n\nI considered deleting this post because it makes me look stupid, but I still think its good info to be aware of.", "created_utc": 1583442805.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fe27l5/psa_anyone_switching_from_robinhood_to_other/", "is_self": true}
