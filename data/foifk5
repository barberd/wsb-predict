{"id": "foifk5", "title": "DIN might be a goose egg", "selftext": "Dine Brands International Inc. (DIN) is the corporate parent of Applebee's and IHOP. \n\nAs of their most recent 10-K, their balance sheet was as follows:\n\nAssets:\n\n*$116M cash\n\n*$230M non-cash current assets\n\n*$600M long-term tangible assets, a little more than half of which is operating lease right-of-use\n\n*$1.1B intangible assets, much of which is goodwill\n\nLiabilities:\n\n*$160M gift card liability\n\n*$24M deferred employee compensation and benefits\n\n*$174M other current liabilities\n\n*$1.3B long-term debt\n\n*$360M operating lease liabilities\n\n*$240M other non-current liabilities\n\nEven if we add back in the gift cards and employee compensation, they have a book value of essentially zero. They also filed an 8-K last week stating that they drew down $220M from their revolving credit facility \"although the Company has no need for additional liquidity\" (lol, sure), which means they have more cash but an offsetting amount of debt.\n\nBased on their 10-K for FY2019, 98% of their revenue came from within the US, and \"At December 31, 2019, there were no long-lived assets located outside of the United States.\" If giant sections of the US are locked down for much of Q1 and Q2, their revenue will be close to zero. And in that case it's not clear how these poor motherfuckers are gonna pay their rent, much less their $1.3B in long-term debt.\n\nThey're down like 75% over the past month, because everyone knows they're pretty fucked. But that's after they were up 33% today, because some morons think Trump is gonna bail out IHOP shareholders, even though he clearly prefers McDonald's breakfast. I say no, this company is on a Virgin Galactic ship to Chapter 11. Even after the economy reopens, who the fuck is gonna choose to celebrate by going to Applebee's?\n\ntldr: $DIN 20p 4/17", "created_utc": 1585103065.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/foifk5/din_might_be_a_goose_egg/", "is_self": true}
