You see, Pfizer will be releasing data on their coronavirus vaccine within the very near future, and as we all know, stocks with COVID treatments skyrocket on even the slightest hint of good news.  Look at GILD, MRNA and NVAX.  You might say that Pfizer is bigger than all three of them so will have less volatility and you would be correct, but GILD has a 93B market cap, so while PFE is twice as big at 187B, if inconclusive data on GILD can send it up 10% plus, think about what positive data on a coronavirus vaccine that will actually hit the public in September will do.  \n\nThe best part about this is that PFE options are pricing in extremely low volatility, so they aren\u2019t even expecting much of a move which is quite surprising given how the market has reacted to coronavirus treatment news in the past.  This means that instead of IV crush, there will be an IV spike if PFE takes off after the data is released.  So not only will you make money from the stock price increasing, you will also be making money from IV as well.  Money + money = TENDIES.  \n\nLooking from a technicals standpoint, the play becomes even better.  After a pretty poor performance over the last few weeks dropping PFE from over $38 on 5/29 to now $33.70 at the time of this post, the RSI has fallen quite a bit down to 35. Momentum now seems to be shifting upwards, and positive coronavirus data might be just the play to send it soaring as there is a ton of room to run before RSI gets even close to overbought.\n\nNow you may be thinking that this sounds nice and all, but what if the data is bad.  Well let me put your mind at ease. It won\u2019t be. They are testing four different vaccines in the largest vaccine trial to-date involving the 18-80 age group and across 3 different markets (Europe, the USA and China).  Pfizer is so confident in their vaccine they are outsourcing production of their patented drugs to increase manufacturing capacity for these vaccine candidates ahead of results.\n\nAnd no one should forget that the second data is released, Donny Pump will be all over this.  Tweets will say that a cure is almost here thanks to Pfizer, and boomers will pile into PFE stock for that juicy dividend and retail millennials will fomo into it because Pfizer will become the next hyped up corona play.\n\nTo add icing on this cake, did I mention that Pfizer\u2019s new diabetes drug was just discovered to make people lose over 17 pounds, improves blood sugar tremendously, and will be an oral agent to replace existing injectable options within the class? Every diabetic man, woman, and child is going to be asking to be on this weight-loss drug (typical diabetes drugs cause weight gain). They are about to announce this information today at 11:30 EST in a conference call with analysts to review data presentations at the American Diabetes Association held on June 12-16, 2020 on their oral small molecule GLP-1R agonist (PF-06882961).\n\nThe market has not reacted to this yet, as there have been no articles by any major news sources on the data, nor has the stock price reacted at all. Pfizer not only has the COVID vaccine going for them, but also extremely promising data for their diabetes drug. The momentum from these upcoming headlines should push PFE back to a normal valuation; it is currently selling at a discount lower than any price in 2019 and has recently been oversold from May valuations. \n\nPositions:  I have $38 and $39 PFE calls, as I believe at the current price they have huge potential to be at least a 10 bagger at minimum if not more and I picked 7/17 as the expiration date because of the liquidity and because of the IV spike that will accompany positive data next week.", "created_utc": 1592485508.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hbe7qf/pfizer_call_will_get_your_pp_harder_than_viagra/", "is_self": true}
