WTF I thought, so I tried again...and again. Then I ran over to my desktop and couldn't even get Robinhood to load. Throughout the day I would open the app, I could see my contracts and I would try to sell them (I did this like 10 times). Then later this evening I received an email saying my contracts executed at 9:45am for $492/each, however, when I looked at Robinhood tonight it said I still had two contracts valued at $886/each. Now that the app is fixed my SPY calls are gone and I received the $492/each.\n\nIt seems like it executed during one of the lowest points of the day and the fact I didn't receive this email until 4:00pm is annoying.\n\nNow, this is very common for me to sell my options before they have any value but that's MY JOB and Robinhood did it for me. Can I do anything else besides complain?", "created_utc": 1583207110.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fcoo64/did_anyone_else_have_contracts_execute_during_the/", "is_self": true}
