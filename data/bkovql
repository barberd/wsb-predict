{"id": "bkovql", "title": "EA Analysis (Mostly about Apex)", "selftext": "So iv'e been suggesting for awhile now that EA is about to blow expectations, but I haven't provided my reasoning yet. First EA has very stable IPs (ie. sports, battlefield, star wars) that will continue to generate consistent revenue. Anthem was a flop, but still generated revenue on purchases; I would not expect this to produce any better future guidance though. Now the golden goose, Apex Legends. Analysts are looking at Apex by the only metric they have available, which is twitch; now let me explain why this is a bad metric for predicting active player count. Twitch viewership will migrate to the channels that are most popular ie. Ninja, Timthetatman, Dr. Disrespect, and Shroud (list goes on). A lot of these channels have tied themselves to Fortnite, which is why they are not willing to change. These channels also produce cult like followings, which is why Fortnite viewership still reigns supreme. Sure that is lost advertisment, but as new content is released some of these big names might come back to give it some more publicity. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think Apex, which I will remind you has only been out for like 3 months, has more staying power than people give it credit for. They ramped up effort to get rid of cheaters, The servers are stabilizing, they have provided a year roadmap for content, and have opened up communication with the community. All of this suggests that Apex has a growing interest and that player count might still be expanding not contracting.", "created_utc": 1556998535, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bkovql/ea_analysis_mostly_about_apex/", "is_self": true}
