It was MONOPOLY MONEY, people were gambling, capitalism doesn't really work that way, does it?    Now COMPANY X can tell you how very profitable they were last quarter and everybody gets a dividend, but now that everyone and I mean everyone is scrambling for the hills, golden parachutes need to be paid for, chances are NEXT quarter, there will be no profits and no dividends. \n\nSo all STOCK money can go to zero. \n\nBONDS are so overbought that the yield is going down to near-zero, as well.  You really think the US Government, who has a 22 trillion dollar deficit when the economy is as good as it's ever going to get, is going to repay you that $10,000 of bond money ten years from now?  There won't BE a ten years from now America at this rate, I guarantee it!\n\nAnd people say, PEAK FEAR will be when there are so many dead bodies in the homes, that the ambulance services can't keep up, when the whole neighborhood has that dead-body AMMONIA smell.  That will be Peak Fear. \n\nOr maybe it gets EVEN WORSE from there, I dunno. \n\nWhat do you, WSB, think PEAK FEAR looks like?", "created_utc": 1583981119.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fh9g5u/wsb_discussion_zone_what_will_constitute_peak_fear/", "is_self": true}
