Apparently my store is doing top 100. And we only beat our expectation by like 15%. Everyone else is garbage from what she told me. And she works her ass off to keep the store to maximum profits, those that think every penny counts. Anyway DG is doing better overall for the year but nothing significant to show for. Earnings whisper suggests a cent over expected. Which is the \u201cbetter overall\u201d fact source. Thats what the bosses are told I guess. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m not too sure what guidance means but its not good apparently from what the nerds at investing say about mango man and whatnot. Cuz retail is bad rn? idfk\n\nWhat I\u2019m mainly looking at, is the fact that out of 15k stores, our store in the top 100 beat by 15% more or less.\n\nSo Puts ITM. I\u2019ll throw 1k on it.\n\nI\u2019m 80% sure on this. But if I\u2019m wrong and you lose money just remember that you listened to a random guy on the internet. On the other hand if you win bigly, remember that it was all thanks to a guy on the internet.
