{"id": "bx2l2o", "title": "Trade idea - ATVI", "selftext": "\n$ATVI is a steal at this level..I am going long term calls, as well as going long. Do not underestimate the recent $APPL settlement that is going to prevent apple from taking 30% of all in app purchases. Activision's mobiles games will see a big boost in revenue if that is taken down to say, 10%? Candy Crush made 1.5billion last year, think about how much that was shrunk by the 30% apple take-away. Not to mention Diablo/Cod mobile will be coming out further taking advantage of those decreased app profit takeaways. Get in early before E3 and take advantage of beaten down stock. The sector has recovered and atvi is next. It is a great opportunity to get into a leader in a constantly expanding industry with many short term and long term catalysts (particularly esports). \n\nThis is a great value play in my mind.\nI would take a look at the these calls:\nJan 15 2021 strike 50 at 5.85\nJan 15 2021 strike 55 at 4.05\n\nI would argue these give you good exposure for the money, but alternatively if you would like to go long I think that is a good play as well. It all depends on the amount of capital you are willing to put out.", "created_utc": 1559741474, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bx2l2o/trade_idea_atvi/", "is_self": true}
