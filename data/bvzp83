Not enough to buy real estate, so the next thing would be, well stock. \n\nI'm thinking about buying (obviously), specifically AMD (Advanced Micro Devices), but first of all, i don't know how to evaluate a company if it's good, bad, neutral / long run, short run etc.\n\nI don't plan to jump out, but rather have that sucker in there and just let it sit as don't need that money, so 100% long term. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, my question would be, do you think if it's a good/bad idea, and if it is how did you come to the conclusion.\n\nAlso, if you don't wish to share (what is 100% understandable, every man for himself), what material should i read that'd educate me on the subject of the stock market (if it's heavy in math, i don't really mind)\n\nThanks\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nps.: hope flaring is correct", "created_utc": 1559495758, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bvzp83/im_pretty_new_to_the_stock_market_and_would_like/", "is_self": true}
