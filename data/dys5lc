But your life doesn't have to continue down that path. Here are two stocks, that \\*oh yikes\\* you might just have to buy common shares and hold it for 24 months. I know, I know, you want tendies next week. Well this isn't that kind of pla, but here you go:  \n\n\n1) GPRO.  I'm quickly becoming the GoPro Stan of this sub. I'll die on that hill. This is a brilliant play for autistic gamblers. You can do anything with it: Fire on the $3.5 next week calls, buy the 4/20 $5 FDs, or just do the smart thing for once, and load up on common shares. You can max out that RH account on the common and not have to sweat every tick into expiration. This stock is turning around. This company is a world wide brand. They posted what could be the last losing quarter of the next 5 years, and the street hates them. This fucker tanked 15% without any news over the past few days and could go lower. But you have February earnings as your savior. Before you go looking at March calls, pull your head out of your ass and realize some rando on the internet could be 1 quarter off and you have to hold for 6 months to really see the turn around. But that shit is coming. Most can't see it because GPRO has been a negative stock meme for years. Jump in. This is your \\~100% in 1 year kind of shit, which I know may not be good enough for the ravenous masses. Fine. Buy your $.35 11/29 calls and try to catch the bounce. See if I care. I'll be here with my steel hands.   \n\n\n2) SPCE.  What? You didn't hear that Virgin Galactic went public? That's because they did it through Chamath's shenanigans Social Capital merger whatever. There was no roadshow. there was no hype. there was no 14 analysts with the 14 buy ratings when it came out. This shit will take a year or two, but when they start launching insta models into space in 2020, this shit will be fire. Who knows if it gets to cool space hotels and shit, but you best believe when you start seeing \"I'm the richest nigga in space lol\" Insta posts, it's too late. That shit runs to $100 /share before anyone looks at a balance sheet. Hype train, 1 year away. I'm getting on board now.", "created_utc": 1574203044, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dys5lc/gambles_most_autists_cant_wait_for_but_are/", "is_self": true}
