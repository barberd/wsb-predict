I followed the statements of the article and they have been pretty much spot on and actually helped me recouped my losses from puts that I bought during the ATH IV. Basically, they state that DOW will be pushed toward 25,000 before the reality check kicks in and the second leg down begins. The article was from March 31st when DOW was around 22,000. To be honest, despite the massive pumps by JPow and the Feds, the market is highly inflated in itself and big players are pulling out even with the continuous gains. \n\nTL;DR: Possible top when DOW reaches 25,000 before a reality check kicks the market down like a dirty dog.", "created_utc": 1586470998.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fy222j/possible_top_when_dow_at_25000/", "is_self": true}
