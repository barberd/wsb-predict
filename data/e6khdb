Prints. Fucking. Money. \n\nThe phase 3 trials for this thing are insanely good. The New England journal of medicine, AKA THE GUIDING ROD OF MEDICAL CHANFE, has covered these in published results a few months ago. \n\nWith 95% of doctors who treat this disease already saying they would prescribe the medication... the science backs the financials in a big way. \n\n10k dosage, insurance coverage because of lacking alternatives after PA for most plans, and a company that previously was in a 2.2billion kiddie pool market share has the potential to skyrocket with this thing come February.\n\nSimple DD: Buy calls.
