{"id": "gbrxja", "title": "Population ratios effects on the stock market", "selftext": "So i was [reading this](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2004/01/2004a_bpea_geanakoplos.pdf) thought it was interesting. They take they comapre younger working adults to middle age (age 40-65) working adults to try to predict the stock market. The basic theory is that younger adults(age 20-39) are likely to take out debt and be broke from having kids vs middle age whom would be investing and building their retirement.\n\nNow, i was interested in a different ratio: the **retired population vs the working population**, defined as:\n\n\\-working population age 19-64\n\n\\-retired popuation 65+\n\nMy general thesis is that the working population serves as buyers into the stock market and the retired population serves as eventually sellers in the stock market. And yes, im aware many retiress stay invested, but they stop adding to their accounts and begin to make withdrawals overall. **I'll post the data in the comment section** to make this post easier to read.\n\nIn 1950 the ratio is about 10x, meaning there are 10 working class buying stocks for every 1 retiree withdrawaling from stocks. Today that ratio has steadily decreased and to about 6x and will be 3.5x by the time many of you retire.\n\nFood for thought: how many new buyers does it take to replace one seller? Adjusted for inflation, the dow jones has made 1,000% gains since the 1950s, so does it take 10x new buyers to displace a seller with 1,000% return? luckily they are not cashing out 100% and only take out what they need to spend each month. So we stay afloat with only 6x new buyers for every 1 retired seller.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**HOW DO I MAKE TENDIES FROM THIS?** The mechanics of the stock market work like a ponzi scheme, a growing population means the ponzi scheme will keep going. A declining population means stonks go down. **Long term SPY puts**", "created_utc": 1588372236.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gbrxja/population_ratios_effects_on_the_stock_market/", "is_self": true}
