I crowed sourced /r/investing (smart people) who gave me a couple of suggestions to look into. The stocks I decided that were worthwhile to choose from were:\n\nMCD, CHD, ROST, DLTR, DG, EW\n\nThe criteria I used were how little it dropped during the recession but more importantly how fast it recovered. The thinking was that if I bought the longest expiration leap calls (as I tend to do) at the height before the recession hit, would the market be able to recover before they expired? Dollar tree didn't even lose value in 2009, and ROST consistently regained value very fast after around \\~1 year, and that's good because if I buy 2 years out leap calls at the money I would\u2019ve been able to regain value or even profit through the recession.\n\nSin stock etfs look like they blew up in 2018.\n\nWhat other stocks do you think are stable to invest in through a possible recession?", "created_utc": 1582517980, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f8lpig/recently_i_looked_into_recession_proof_stocks_and/", "is_self": true}
