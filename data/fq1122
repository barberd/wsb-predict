The rises in these companies are an obvious bubble. Just take a look at the three-month charts for any of these tickers. Where does their profit come from? What do they do uniquely that gives them an edge over other similar companies? Once the crisis is over (say, 3-6 months from now), these companies will be no better than they were before the crisis. Slack and Zoom especially don't have any alternative product.\n\nFor instance, morningstar gives Zoom a fair value of $62, Slack $20, Netflix $150. These estimates aren't everything, but fundamentally none of these companies have done anything to increase their true value during the crisis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nrcgplk6z8p41.png?width=1278&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5badc809933f01cd7390fdc52d124367d0ff951\n\nSimilarly, I've seen a lot of risky plays on companies that will obviously have value after coronavirus is over. Uber, Lyft, Ford all have deep enough pockets to wait out coronavirus, and once things are back to normal, they'll be just as valuable. This is why they skyrocketed a few days ago, and why Puts on them won't be as profitable. This being said, I think there's still room to drop and am personally betting on a \"bottom\" in mid-May, based on my virus model. If a recession follows, there will be a long bleed afterwards, but I admit there's potential for a quick recovery, and would maybe even bet more heavily on this side, unless you believe strongly in the underlying problems with repos/loans or whatever.\n\nI'm still holding SPY, QQQ, F, LYFT, and SNAP puts for between now and May 15th.", "created_utc": 1585329369.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fq1122/slack_zoom_netflix_etc_insanely_overvalued/", "is_self": true}
