Since these have no time decay (in the sense of theta, strike date) you can hold them as long as you need to recover loses from your PUTs. SPXL is still down 60% from 52wk high, so lots of room for growth.\n\nSP500 goes down? PUTs print, hold SPXL until it recovers (Dollar Cost Average as needed)\n\nSP500 goes up? PUTs die, hold SPXL until you cover loses\n\nSP500 stays flat-ish or grows slowly? This is were you get into a bad spot.\n\nPlenty of other strategies, but this one is easy enough for ~~anyone to understand.~~ (apparently I don't understand well enough to describe it correctly)\n\nApparently I'm off the mark on my description but from an aggressive strategy perspective, thoughts?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I am wrong about time decay specifically, but in practice have no strike date. Won't delete post, I own my mistakes.\n\n*(Disclaimer: This isn't investment advice, but instead a discussion on strategy)*", "created_utc": 1586378140.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxeb74/hedge_time_decay_and_loss_from_your_puts_with/", "is_self": true}
