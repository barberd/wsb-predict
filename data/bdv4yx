{"id": "bdv4yx", "title": "Day Trading Nerves?", "selftext": "So I have been trading stocks for a little over three years.  Mostly long term investments and some swing trading.  I have been pretty successful with it, but really wanted to get into trading more aggressively.  So a few months ago I went PDT and have been doing pretty well.  My problem is that since I started day trading I have been really nervous in the mornings.  That nasty butterfly feeling in the stomach you know?  Sometimes it even upsets my stomach a bit.\n\nI figure it's just jitters from doing something new and fast paced, but I'd love to hear some stories from vets that have done this for a long time.  When you were a greenie did you have nerves at opening bell?  How long until you felt confident enough in your abilities that they went away?  Did they ever do away?  I love day trading and I feel like I'm pretty good at it, but I also don't really want to fight nerves the rest of my career.\n\nNew things can be scary I know, but it's still nice to hear from other people who have been there you know?  I really appreciate anyone willing to offer up some words here.  Thanks!", "created_utc": 1555427932, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bdv4yx/day_trading_nerves/", "is_self": true}
