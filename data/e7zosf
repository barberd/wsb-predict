After skim-reading the (148 page...) prospectus for the bond I clocked the phrase 'EURIBOR' &amp; which seems like a reasonable thing to tie the interest of your bond to. \n\nThe current 12-month EURIBOR rate is -0.269%. Going back to MarketsInsider, they don't quote the coupon, but they do quote the yield of the bond as being -0.27% even though the bond is currently priced at \u20ac100, and has a face value of \u20ac100. So yeah, I think it's fair to say that bond has a  -0.27% coupon.\n\nAccording to MarketsInsider, they issued \u20ac1,000,000,000 worth of bonds in April of 2019. \n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the company has 12 employees.\n\nTo sum up what I'm saying: The ECB can and will print money to buy these bonds. ABB only have pay back 99.73% of the initial \u20ac1'000'000'000 loan. Meaning, they can split the remaining \u20ac2.7 Million amongst the 12 of them. \n\nOf course, I'm sure they aren't doing this. At the bottom of the 148-page prospects you can see that both KPMG and EY audited the deal. Plus, 18 banks - including HSBC and Goldman Sachs - were involved in the deal. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSources if you cba to google:  \nECB website, where you can find an original copy of the list of bonds: [https://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/implement/omt/html/index.en.html#cspp](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/implement/omt/html/index.en.html#cspp)\n\nGoogle sheet of eligible companies:  \n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dXZtb-\\_f-IoZj9ORZM0zbXSXNteabJarDfbMBxI8kAM/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dXZtb-_f-IoZj9ORZM0zbXSXNteabJarDfbMBxI8kAM/edit?usp=sharing&amp;authuser=0)  \n\n\nGoogle Sheet of companies eligible for the UK's bond-buying program, for those interested.
