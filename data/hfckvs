{"id": "hfckvs", "title": "Las Vegas Report 6/24", "selftext": "MGM has been a hot topic on here the last few weeks. I decided to stop by Vegas with my girlfriend for a few nights and figured it\u2019d be helpful to share some information that may stop any more of you autists from buying MGM calls.\n\n1) Capacity down- almost everything in casinos has been reorganized. There are less places to sit at games and tables, less tables in general, and not all slot machines are open\n2) Lack of people- I would estimate hotels are at about 30-40% capacity. This comes from hanging around the last few days and I have no statistics to prove this other than experience. At the pool midday, only half the chairs were full when normally they are at 100% capacity (pre corona)\nDelayed reopening- many restaurants remain closed especially those inside casinos.\n4) Sportsbooks- I was planning on placing some bets on the EPL but was surprised to find many sports books were closed (tried to place the bet on Tuesday). Realized this made sense considering how few sporting events were going on. \n\nTLDR: Vegas is completely different than it was before the virus and the changes will result in less revenue over time. Puts on casinos for several months out.", "created_utc": 1593044894.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hfckvs/las_vegas_report_624/", "is_self": true}
