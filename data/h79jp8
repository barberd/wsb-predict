After printing money during a week where America had its greatest social unrest in at least 50 years, now we\u2019re going to be bearish about COVID?\n\nEven my RV stocks where the whole bull case is built on COVID staying...tanked.\n\nBag holding Nordstrom.  Down over 20% now that all the stores are open.  Last week they soared when they were being looted.\n\nJPow said nothing people didn\u2019t already know.  Rates will stay low, employment will take awhile, virus is a worry in the fall.  People initially gave it the green thumbs up.  We should actually want JPow to be worried about the economy.  How else will the market get flooded with more prints?\n\nI think this was blowing off steam from the last couple weeks.  Staying long but wishing I listened to my gut to sell last Friday.", "created_utc": 1591919257.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h79jp8/unnecessary_bearishness/", "is_self": true}
