If you're using another broker I'll assume you already know about diagonal spreads.\n\n**Why do this?** It allows you to \"lock in your gains\", and unlike entering a straddle (where you buy an opposite options) you won't lose money on theta burn\n\n**How to do this?**\n\n1) Get advanced tier options trading on RH if you don't already have it\n\n2) Make money on your options. Let's say you're up 120% on the SPY 2/28 322.5 put you bought today\n\n3) SELL the same expiration, but a lower strike price (for a put; higher for a call). Click on Sell on the top left corner. Using the above example, sell a SPY 2/28 319 put\n\n4) If SPY drops more, you'll still make money on your bought put even while you're losing money on your sold put. Total gain will stay relatively the same. Same is true for the opposite, if SPY goes up you'll make money on your sold put while losing money on your bought put; again total gain will stay relatively the same\n\n5) The next day (in the morning unless you know what you're doing), buy back the put you sold and sell the put you bought.\n\n- MAKE SURE you have enough available cash in your account to buy back the option(s) you sold! Leave enough room for the possibility the option you sold could go up in value by over 100%\n\n- If you're wondering what happens for early assignment, or if you just let your options expire ITM...look it up.", "created_utc": 1582663792, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9gxu1/the_diagonal_spread_ie_how_to_day_trade_wo_25k_in/", "is_self": true}
