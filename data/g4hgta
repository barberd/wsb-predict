{"id": "g4hgta", "title": "MRNA Bullish? short-term", "selftext": "What's up cool cats and kittens, how are your SPY puts holding up? Oh what's that you say, they're in hell?!?! I'm sorry to hear that, maybe you shouldn't have begged your Nan to cash out her Roth IRA, now she'll be worked to the bone till the day she dies. She will never sleep again till she eventually stumbles into her coffin. That's on you, you have to live with that, you robbed an old granny of her retirement you sick fuckers!\n\nAnyways, I'm not here to talk about autist SPY puts right now. I know there is a lot of bearish sentiment regarding MRNA atm because it could very easily be the next meme stock, I agree. What do y'all think short-term after Donny Pump cut them a check for [$483M](https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/moderna-receives-483-million-barda-award-for-covid-19-vaccine-development)? Does this mean the sentiment surrounding the stock is still hype?  We all know it popped during after hours trading last Thursday, but is the moon mission over yet? Look, I couldn't give two fucks about MRNA's long term prospects, but do y'all think the beer virus hype carrying this stock will last until mid-May? According to the chart analysis, it seems to be following a cup & handle breakout pattern: [$MRNA Stonks TA](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/MRNA/4kNWoFYu-MRNA-Cup-Handle-Breakout/). Legend has it that Stalin once said: \"In mUddAh RussiA, it wise to fill your cup with VoDkA, but it even wiser to stick your meat in the cup\". Now I am no Stalin, but what do all you edumacated swine think about this cup bullshit? Is it feasible?\n\nIf so, this is the play I have been contemplating:  17th Jul $60.00 $MRNA Call.\n\nBefore you wankers come at my throat, I am no fucking IB analyst. Please reply ASAP, I want to know before I burn another hole in my wallet tomorrow.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2utekz7ozut41.png?width=1865&format=png&auto=webp&s=536a29162b401de6d2c11cdef7db70214c5ca927", "created_utc": 1587337612.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g4hgta/mrna_bullish_shortterm/", "is_self": true}
