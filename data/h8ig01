{"id": "h8ig01", "title": "The coming weeks", "selftext": "The federal reserve has severely reduced it's purchasing of Treasury bonds. Back in late April and early May they were purchasing 10-15 billion dollars worth a day. This last week they slowed it down and again will slow it down to about 2.66 billion per day starting Monday 10:30  - 11:30 am eastern time lasting through to July 12th.

Your thoughts? \n\nAlso, go check out the federal reserve's website for the full numbers on their quantitative easing. Printer go Brr Brr Brr Broke\n\n(Also, how the fuck did Black Rock get in on asset purchasing. I smell something and it smells like bullshit)\n\nPositions: SPY P 285 7/2 | VXX C  41.5  6/19 | DAL P 29 7/2", "created_utc": 1592090960.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h8ig01/the_coming_weeks/", "is_self": true}
