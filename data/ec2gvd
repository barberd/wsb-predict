PACB is down ~10% after hours. PacBio might not be long for this world if this acquisition falls through as they've been operating at huge losses and Oxford Nanopore's sequencing technology is getting better constantly. \n\nIllumina's original price target was $8 bucks a share and PACB is down under $5. Might be a good time to ~~gamble~~ strategically purchase options based on the predicted outcome.\n\nTrial begins Aug 18, 2020.", "created_utc": 1576618768, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ec2gvd/illuminas_ilmn_acquitions_of_pacific_biosciences/", "is_self": true}
