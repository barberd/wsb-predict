No conspiracy at all and I\u2019ll explain why which will make investing and understanding markets much easier.", "selftext": "The most irritating thing I deal with in the investing world is ignorance. Most all of that ignorance comes from hatred towards the fed, the dollar, and banks. \n\nThe dollar is the reserve currency of the world for one reason and one reason only. DEMAND FOR THE US DOLLAR. Here is why. \n\nThe FDIC only insures you to 250,000 dollars on an individual bank account and twice that for a dual account. So if you want to keep your money safe if you have more then that you will need to get another bank and then another and another which is not realistic. \n\nWhat happens when you have that much money is not hard to imagine. You either take care of the money yourself or you hire an expert. \n\nMost people with this much money are not that concerned with making more but with protecting it. \n\nUnited States treasuries are 100% guaranteed and the only country never to default on a debt payment. \n\nNot only do American rich people protect there money this way but foreigners can too but not until they convert their currency into Dollars. This is where the reserve currency comes into play. \n\nAround 40% or more of all the worlds currency is held in dollars. VOLUNTARILY! \n\nThere is no conspiracy, the whole gold argument is nothing more then ignorance and once you accept reality it makes decision making much easier. \n\nLong story short. Educate yourself with unbiased information intended to do nothing more then educate. \n\nMy best sources are TEXTBOOKS!", "created_utc": 1589729164.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/glh8ic/how_the_dollar_really_became_the_worlds_reserve/", "is_self": true}
