I wouldn\u2019t like to waste your time I found your info on a stock and crypto related page and I said to myself I must share you some good news, I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m CNN lol Do you trade?\n\n# ME: not any more bruh , i went tits up\n\n\ud83d\udcf7Oh i see, but why?\n\n# ME: i said i went tits up ... that means i blew up robinhood\n\n\ud83d\udcf7That, what i'm asking , what happened it's blew up ?\n\n# ME: that means options expired to worthless, saying no no words and cant trade no more\n\n\ud83d\udcf7Most people refuse to trade, because they feel that having small account is a crutch and that it\u2019s an uphill battle too hard to climb lol, others because of their 9-5 jobs they can\u2019t trade but they forget that they can employ the services of professionals like me to trade for them. The market is constantly changing so if you try to trade it the way you traded it 6 months ago, you are going to lose money.One way to resolve the issue is to maintain awareness of the market stages and these stages are known as accumulation, advancing, distribution and declining.\n\n# ME: bruh , i dont trade i gamble . i dont think you see the issue here trading is for pussies , my brothers and sisters in WSB r/wallstreetbets will laugh at me if I hire you\n\n\ud83d\udcf7How will they **laugh** at you when you will be making good money from this?\n\n# ME: you know what ... you sound like a very educated person.But I did tell you outta the getco , MY ROBINHOOD ACCOUNT BLEW UP !!! I WENT TITS UP , that MEANS i am eating ramen noodles !!\n\n# $SPY 50p didnt happen !! \n\n \ud83d\udcf7How much are you currently holding in your Robinhood? \n\n# ME:  ... when your account blow up... you either have zero or a M call......  and i m also not allow to trade until the next month... not June but July , i believer i day traded like 7 times one of those last days...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt seems like that dude just left me alone... \n\nTLDR : $ROPE 69C **All lives matter, and Target wants their shit back since the officer was arrested...**", "created_utc": 1590866653.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gtk2yn/very_interesting_conversation_i_just_had_with/", "is_self": true}
