If you open up the MACD and a 1-month chart you can see the pattern and trend. The volume sold is also much higher than expected. Ive noticed these trends happen over a week frame so lets say you time the MACD and oscillator and buy Ford stock at $8.50. you wait 6 days and see that the MACD is showing bearish signs so you sell against for $9. You've just made $.50 a share. \n\nIf you were to invest $100 into this you would have a quick 5% gain in a week. I tested my theory out yesterday Bought at $8.83 and sold at $9.05 today. I invested $500 into it and made $12 profit(I could have bought earlier and sold later).", "created_utc": 1574872012, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e2iefu/ford_analysis_100_iq_play/", "is_self": true}
