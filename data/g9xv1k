Harley Davidson has been an overweight garbage company for a while now and it's time for Chinese bat flu to put them out of business.\n\nW Harley-Davidson Inc reported a drop of about 45% in quarterly profit on Tuesday as motorcycle sales took a hit from global lockdowns due to the coronavirus pandemic. Well first off you need to think about the economic decisions people are currently making during this time. Considering all these boomers are dying from bat flu and/or are stuck on their hospital beds they're not going to be buying an overpriced piece of garbage bike for $30k.

Harley wants to implant a shift in strategy for the company that symbolized the counterculture movement of the 1960s comes as it struggles to woo the next generation of younger riders with its electric and nimbler bikes in the United States.\n\nHarley's net income fell to $69.7 million, or 45 cents per share, in the first quarter ended March 29 from $127.9 million, or 80 cents per share, a year earlier. Harley jumped 15% today on news that they beat Q1 earnings. However, Harley cut its quarterly dividend to 2 cents from 38 cents. Earlier this month, it pulled its 2020 profit forecast and decided to temporarily lay off most of its global production employees to reduce costs. Sales have been declining for the past five years in its largest market as its baby-boomers are aging off. Overall sales have fallen 15.5% in the united states and 20.7% internationally.\n\nPuts on this shit company at any time and you win", "created_utc": 1588115225.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9xv1k/puts_on_hog/", "is_self": true}
