I work for an online tutoring company in the UK part time and the UK government already gives them \u00a31000 per low income person so imagine when schools have to shut.\n\nONLINE TUTORING IS DONE FROM HOME\nAnd imagine all the rich people who will pay for it themselves aswell because they need to pass exams.\n\nTLDR: Any company involved in online tutoring = big fucking money during a pandemic \nEDU, BFAM, STRA, \nJust do some research and find some tutoring/education stocks I bet there\u2019s fucking loads", "created_utc": 1583218652, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fcqu47/online_tutoring/", "is_self": true}
