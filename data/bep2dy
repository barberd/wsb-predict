Explain why this may work out.", "selftext": "Long story short, I accidentally bought a GCG call at the daily high in RH when i wanted to buy a put.  I am not too fond of navigating the RH options platform and trying to get a good entry point, I made a split decision and swiped up. SO STUPID. It was too late, i realized i just became an autist looking for some form of acceptance from your group. (or already was one in denial)   Here was my plan...I decided that I was going to buy a few CGC puts with the same expiration date to cover my ass.  I believe this is known as a straddle.  I would love to say i'm testing out new strats, but that just ain't true.  I'm an impulstic idiot frantically looking for a way out.  Cherry on top-i;m 1 day trade away from being market as a pattern day trader so i couldn't get out immediately  Did I cover my ass enough so i wont lose a fuck ton of money?  I have $1818 on the line.    $133-$150 value for a balance of $-17 loss at the moment.  I was always scared to try a new strategy, this may be the start.
