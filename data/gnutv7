Slack is reporting earnings on June 4th AMC. Slack's competitor, Microsoft Teams, has seen extreme growth during this time period and has been very public on their daily active user numbers (DAU's). \n\nIn October, it was [reported that Microsoft teams has just surpassed Slack in DAU's](https://venturebeat.com/2019/07/11/microsoft-teams-has-13-million-daily-active-users-beating-slack/) (13 million vs 12 million DAU's). Now, Microsoft has reported 3 key figures on their growth with teams since then.\n\nWeek of March 18th:  44 Million DAU's\n\nWeek of April 29th: 75 million DAU's\n\nSource: [https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-teams-hits-75-million-daily-active-users-2020-4](https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-teams-hits-75-million-daily-active-users-2020-4)\n\nWhile many people may worry that Microsoft Team's growth may stifle Slack's growth, statistics from Slack searches in google and follower count suggest that Slack had a significant amount of growth as well. The fact that Microsoft has grown 570% in DAU's since the October figure, signifies that Slack has had a significant amount of growth as well. Slack's revenue comes solely from the subscription of its service model. Even a 200-300% growth (24 million to 36 million DAU's) in DAU's will sharply increase Slack's revenue for Q1 and allow them to have better guidance. \n\nUnlike other stocks like ZM and PTON, WORK (Slack) is still an underdog in terms of their growth. They have not released another DAU statistic since the October date and the earnings call on June 4th will cover beggining of the year through April. Slack has the potential to moon like Twilio.\n\nTLDR: WORK $35c 6/19", "created_utc": 1590059060.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gnutv7/dd_the_key_statistic_on_why_you_should_not_sleep/", "is_self": true}
