Got rekt on the 3rd, had 9k left. And have now lost that as well. \n\nI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m gonna do now, clearly I can\u2019t make money trading right now. I want to blame external factors but really it\u2019s just my shitty decisions and unwillingness or inability to see clearly. Don\u2019t have any money left to put in so will be taking a break from trading to re-evaluate things and build up some capital. This isn\u2019t my first time blowing up an account, always used to bounce back but now idk. Anyways enjoy the loss porn. \n\n[positions](https://imgur.com/gallery/FS7LcjH)", "created_utc": 1588177902.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gacn90/last_of_my_once_45k_gone_this_month/", "is_self": true}
