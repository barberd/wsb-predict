{"id": "gtjpyx", "title": "Bear Calendar Spread Puts, long-term", "selftext": "After trying to follow the Bull's, I realized I just have shaky hands and watching the market go up and down and reading WSB, it all gave me anxiety.  That being said, I am still bearish on the market, and I don't want to take any risks, so I am doing a rolling Calendar spread at 2800 SPX.  My goal is to do a hold long-term puts, but sell puts rolling them over as they expire.\n\n|Date/Strike|Value|Days to Expire|price/days to expiry|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|6/19 @ 2800|15.60|20|0.78|\n|7/17 @ 2800|41.50|48|0.86|\n|8/21 @ 2800|72.20|83|0.87|\n|9/18 @ 2800|93.50|111|0.84|\n|10/16 @ 2800|112.10|139|0.81|\n|11/20 @ 2800|138|174|0.79|\n|12/18 @ 2800|153.1|202|0.76|\n|1/15 @ 2800|162.5|230|0.71|\n\nAs you can see, the price/days goes down significantly at 1/15/2021.  Assuming market volatility is not too extreme and SPX stays about 2800 for the whole term, you could sell puts at 2800 every month or so and you should be able to get 0.80 to 1.0 price/day on those options.\n\n**Note:** These values are representative on a weekend and the volatility in the market, the actual price of an option can easily jump up or down 10% to 20% depending on the day.\n\n**Caveats:** The basis for selling at 2800 is assuming the market stays at that level consistently for the year.  If SPX goes down, you should sell a lower strike option. If the market goes down pass your strike price, SERIOUSLY consider buying it, and selling your Long put.  If the market tanks you can lose money if it goes down far enough fast enough.\n\nShort-term Calendar spread at 2800,  [http://opcalc.com/8yj](http://opcalc.com/8yj)\n\nPossible overall Outcomes,\n\n**Market(3200+):** If the market goes up to 3400 and stays there, good news, bad news.\n\n* **Bad news,** you are going to come out a loser in your puts.\n* **Good news**, JPow has bought everything and then some and everyone will be working for the Feds and the banks.
