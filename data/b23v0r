I find it offensive. If you were to create a word-cloud visualization of the language used on wsb, I bet \u201cinvestor\u201d is largely absent or in the very fine print.  And that\u2019s because no one pretends wsb is an investment forum.  Investment forums are fucking boring.  Jack Bogle and all that shit. Diversification and low-fee indexes. Fucking AOL shit.\n\nSo when Charlie Munger, the co-godfather of boring-ass value investing says \u201cI would be comfortable putting 100% of my net-worth into one stock\u201d, what the fuck does that mean?  I mean, he\u2019s old as fuck so maybe that\u2019s just ancient crazy talk. I mean, way back in our Magnavox black-and-white vacuum tube history, before algo trading and 401K\u2019s and QE, the market was way easier, right?  Back in those days, you could buy a railroad stock in a booming economy growing 30% a year and throwing off shitloads of free cash flow at a PE of 2.  Well duh, I\u2019d do that too.  But today, with the S&amp;amp;P500 at an all-time high, trading at a PE of 17, with Washington all kinds of fucked up, North Korea and Brexit and all that, no way is that motherfucker putting all his money in one stock.\n\nExcept he did. Well, Munger and his business partner, Warren Buffett, did.  And here\u2019s how i think it went down:\n\nWay the fuck back when, in 1846 to be exact, Henry Wells and William Fargo (yeah, the same guys) founded a company focused on transporting goods and valuables between NYC and Buffalo. The civil war made the transporting of valuable shit a good-ass business and so over the years, Wells and Fargo expanded their routes and bought a bunch of other companies, all of which were eventually consolidated under the brand of American Express in 1850.  Over the years, AMEX grew and by 1963, they were doing all kinds of shit but this was pre bitcoin and pre Visa/Mastercard, and the credit card business was new and a very tiny percentage of their revenue. Mostly, AMEX made money selling travelers checks and money orders to businesses.\n\nBy 1955, while AMEX was busy hustling money, a con man by the name of Anthony De Angelis started a company called Allied Crude Vegetable Oil Refining Co to take advantage of a US government program to sell excess food to Europe for cheap.  This was shortly after WW2 and the American\u2019s knew pissed off and hungry Europeans started wars, so they were throwing money at shysters like De Angelis to do their part for world peace. \n\nBy 1960, De Angelis was balling and he soon realized he can drive up vegetable oil prices by buying up futures, thereby increasing profits on top of his already government subsidized profits, and so by 1963 he comes up with a plan to corner the vegetable oil market and he starts buying up and storing as much of the shit as he could get his greedy little hands on.\n\nAbout this time, AMEX gets into the business of guaranteeing the value of assets stocked in warehouses, so that shysters like De Angelis could take these guarantees to the banks and borrow more money to buy more inventory to drive up prices and make more money.  It was a very, very small part of AMEX\u2019s business and as fucking crazy as it sounds, the contracts AMEX wrote didn\u2019t require them to cover any losses associated with the inventory they guaranteed.  They just promised.\n\nBy 1963, De Angelis figures, fuck buying vegetable oil.  If I can show the world I own all the motherfucking vegetable oil in existence, and if AMEX and others say my shits real, I could be the fucking OPEC of fried chicken.  But why go through the hassle of buying vegetable oil.  Instead, I\u2019ll just pocket most of the money I borrow from the banks, buy a shit ton of oil drums, fill them 95% full of sea water, and then top them off with a little vegetable oil.  And that\u2019s what he did.  Seriously, I could not make this shit up.\n\nBut sometime that year, an anonymous tipster known only as \u201cthe voice\u201d calls the oil inspectors and tells them to go check out drum number 6006.  And sho \u2018nuff, drum number 6006 would not be frying extra crispy anytime soon. \n\nBut AMEX was a big, diversified business, and although their stock tanks when the story breaks, dropping from $65 to $35 in 1964, it\u2019s still trading at a multiple of 16X earnings.  \n\nEnter Warren Buffett.  You can read up on the dude elsewhere but his greatness is not exaggerated.  There has never been and may never be a value investor like Buffett.  Buffett reads the stories like everyone else and then tells his investors he is going to put 40% of his entire fund into AMEX stock to buy 5% of the company. They were like, \u2018the fuck you are.\n\nBut he does, and the question is why?  There was a scandal, no doubt, but at 17x earnings, it was no fire sale, the country was still dealing with JFK\u2019s assassination, the shit was still pretty hot with the Russians, and no one was lining up to buy the stock.  This wasn\u2019t anywhere near the kind of give-aways that he bought up after 2008 and yet he basically went all-in, risking his future and almost half of his investors\u2019 money on what didn\u2019t seem anything close to a sure thing.  He was alone on this.\n\nHere\u2019s why: Buffett dug deep into the AMEX\u2019s financials and saw that they were not technically liable for any of the losses on the oil swindle.  At the same time, this whole credit card thing seemed like a promising business and doctors back in Omaha were still charging steaks to their green cards.  Meanwhile, they had cash on hand of about $250m, real assets of around $1B, and total liabilities of around $950m.  Unlike banks, they didn\u2019t have the huge overhead of branches, and with all these money orders and traveler checks trading hands, they had a constant \u201cfloat\u201d of money to invest or about $78m.  They also had a CEO who got them out of the shittier businesses they were in, invested deep in the brand and the green card, and was on top of his shit. Unless AMEX shut their doors, this was gonna pass and pass fast.\n\nSo Buffett goes all-in and the stock increases 10X between 1964 and 1973. \n\nIt takes balls to buy cheap when blood is running in the streets.  But to \u201cinvest\u201d like this, well that\u2019s it\u2019s own kind of yolo shit and much hespect to gangster Buffett.", "created_utc": 1552818382, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b23v0r/urban_trade_breakdowns_buffetts_1963_american/", "is_self": true}
