So I had some gay bear leap puts for June and Sept I bought a couple days ago. So I take a little bit of loss and this morning my tarded ass decides to sell the more autistic puts (Sept 203 btw) and change it to short term calls expiring tomorrow.\n\nThe thing I didn't know is that WeBull doesn't settle funds immediately, so when I did the switcheroo I was using unsettled funds. Now, when I try to sell the calls, it gives me a GFV violation warning....the calls expire tomorrow. Am I fucked? Can I sell? What are the rules for GFV?\n\nAm I too dense for WeBull? Do I need to go back to RH even though they like to fuck me? I don't wanna pay commish.....
