{"id": "dp9euq", "title": "The TSLA $15k Roadster YOLO", "selftext": "I had $15,000 that I was going to spend on an interesting old car when I came up with a plan. I found out about this subreddit when I explained this plan to a friend and he said it was \u201csome autistic WSB YOLO shit.\u201d\n\nSo I thought I\u2019d share. TL;DR is basically the last paragraph.\n\nPositions: [https://i.imgur.com/SZJ85tT.png](https://i.imgur.com/SZJ85tT.png)\n\nHere's the deal. TSLA has been wildly fluctuating between about 180 and 380 for most of the past few years as investors swing between being sure Elon is an unstoppable genius and being unsure of his ability to actually make money. The latter seems to be dependent on three factors: Tesla's ability to make cars, maintaining a high margin, and the promise of full self-driving. \n\nThe Tesla factory in Fremont has been steadily increasing production, and the China factory has just begun production. They have stated a target of 500,000 vehicles produced globally in the 12 month period ending June 30, 2020. The Shanghai factory will be able to produce cars much cheaper than the Fremont factory and will help mitigate any tariff issues, making the car cheaper for China, the world's largest auto market. Model Y crossover will be available in North America in the summer of 2020 and should be a relatively easy production ramp considering the carryover of Model 3 components and production lines. Crossovers are a huge segment and this vehicle should have plenty of orders, increasing demand well past the current \\~400k/year production rate and closer to the higher rate they should be capable of at the end of 2020. Also, Musk tweeted that the pickup truck will be unveiled later this year, and supposedly they will begin delivering some semi-trucks next year.\n\nMusk is \"certain\" that Tesla will be \"feature complete\" on full self-driving this year, and that drivers will be able to use full self-driving around the middle of 2020. This seems like a stretch, and he's given dates for this in the past that have come and gone, so, you know, grain of salt.\n\nBut, let's be optimistic. Let's ask: what is a probable valuation of Tesla if things go very well? Let\u2019s imagine this future: By the end of 2020, they are approaching a million cars per year run rate. Model Y production ramp went well and they\u2019re slowly taking over the huge global crossover market. Cars are flying out of the China factory at impressive gross margins. The solar and battery storage side is pulling in some good money with all those solar roofs and industrial grid solutions that are selling like hotcakes thanks in part to California having an inept power company. Full self-driving still hasn\u2019t hit because Musk was wrong about the timing again, but they have been so aggressive and enough progress has been made that they are the clear leader. Waymo is still fucking around in the desert.\n\nIn January 2021, Tesla will be worth, I don't know, $120 Billion. That puts the share price at $666. The new Roadster starts at $200k. But, to get $200k, I need to get more money because taxes. How much do I need? About $350,000. I put my $15,000 into fourteen Jan 2021 calls: four at $350 (yolo) and ten at $440 (YOLO). At $666 per share that gives me $350,000. I did this a few months ago so as of today I\u2019m up $26k. Imma let it ride all the way to my $15k Roadster.", "created_utc": 1572454685, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dp9euq/the_tsla_15k_roadster_yolo/", "is_self": true}
