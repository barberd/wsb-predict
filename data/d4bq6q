{"id": "d4bq6q", "title": "Long QSR. DD Inside.", "selftext": "I went to a McDonald's last Tuesday morning to get my regular Egg McMuffin and also do a line off my own boner in the women's bathroom (the thrill of being caught is much more exciting than you could imagine), when Ronald McDonald himself beat down the stall door and threw me onto a miniature urinal where a frightened woman was washing her hands. Ronald had the angriest look in his face, until he started smiling that beautiful smile of his and offered me some Popeyes chicken. I closed my eyes in abject pleasure as he offered me some good ol' genuine Louisiana Popeyes chicken. I took a bite then opened my eyes to my arms handcuffed behind my back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRonald took me into his car and kept talking into his little black box, and some woman repeated numbers at him until I realized that she was saying stock numbers and strike prices! I forgot what numbers she said but it reminded me that stocks exist, so I giggled as I remembered my Jan 2021 GE 25 calls.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on, Ronald brought me to something called a \"Jail.\" Now I don't know what that words means, but I've heard that it's almost as beloved a hangout spot as the Barbershop to our nation's African American population. And remembered the sweet taste of Popeye's chicken and remembered the African Americans love Popeyes! Ronald took me to a Jail that MUST have a Popeyes inside!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI asked the other patrons, rather loudly, if they liked Popeyes chicken, and all I remember is a bunch of them encircling me and then I proceeded to blackout. They must have been as excited for that chicken as I was.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith so many people excited for Popeyes chicken, I can only surmise that QSR is a good long term investment, if even Ronald McDonald is throwing me out of his own restaurant to bring me to a Popeyes.", "created_utc": 1568498524, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d4bq6q/long_qsr_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
