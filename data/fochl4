Big drop coming and then big rally above $250.\n\nVXX going higher today, VIX should follow. Taking this to mean there's a big drop coming. Probably tomorrow or Thursday. I could honestly see that green dildo coming back to see me tomorrow with big drop with job numbers. And before a fuktard argues the job numbers are \"priced in\" as well, I agree. They are \"priced in\" to the $218 SPY lows. We will see those soon.\n\n\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b POOTS \nDIS $95 5/1 \nDIS $90 5/1\nDIS $80 4/3\nF $4 4/17\nF $5 4/17\nGM $18 5/1\nT $25 4/17", "created_utc": 1585081669.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fochl4/stimpack/", "is_self": true}
