The effects are somewhat masked by higher equity valuations, corporate tax cuts (boosting after-tax profits), and stock buy backs at the end of each year, increasing per-share earnings, despite company-wide operating income stagnating.\n\nMore troubling, is that foreigner investors/governments have been buying very little U.S. treasury notes (debt) since 2015 due its rising cost. As a result, domestic sources have had to buy most of it:\n\n* 4.6 trillion in U.S. treasuries issued from Q1 2015 to Q3 2019\n* $3.9 trillion funded domestically, meaning $3.9 trillion USD was removed from U.S. financial system and converted into Treasuries over a five-year period\n\nThis resulted in temporary, but large USD liquidity drain.\n\nU.S. Federal Reserve immediately printed money to borrow and buy the excess U.S. Treasuries, stabilizing the Repo Market.\n\n**The takeaway from this wall of text:**\n\n*Newly issued U.S. Treasuries are now funded by newly created U.S. dollars because foreign buyers can't afford or don't want to pay such a high price for it, despite needing it.*\n\n&\n\n*The global currency system is running into a supply issue as value increase, while the U.S. slowly loses share of the global GDP.*\n\n&\n\n*The inherent nature of a global reserve currency, and its underlying economy, makes it temporary albeit potentially long lasting.*\n\nThanks for listening.", "created_utc": 1591027320.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gun7ew/the_world_runs_on_usd_how_and_why/", "is_self": true}
