{"id": "g3zoiq", "title": "Why the market 2nd leg down lies ahead", "selftext": "\nReason why the second leg down has not started, here\u2019s a few perspectives to consider for the bottom 70% population.\n\n#1: unemployment benefits for each state last 5 months avg: $300-500/week for ea state. Each state is a cluster for this process and checks do backpay, so expect everyone to get caught up on bills through July (for reason #2) Well, unless their more retard than us and give up on the process.\nhighest impact end Sep/Oct 31st\n\n#2: corona stimulas adds another $600/week to end of July (ex. every trailor park clan with both spouses out of work have hit the lottery making almost 7-8k a month) end July 31st.\n\n#3: PPP, wont go into detail and depends on many factors but for our small business it covers about 2.5 months of rent and payroll. Assume will see an increase of small business bankruptcies and lease defaults when these run out ~June.\n\n#4: Most elite institutions got caught this drop, they\u2019re aware of what\u2019s ahead and will try to recoup gains before the rug is pulled. They won\u2019t get caught on the second leg down. \n\nJPOW/FED know the bottom class is fucked this time around and to prevent revolting the massive stimulus was required. There\u2019s too much liquidity and cash flow to crater the market. Suspect we may go up or we go down, but if unemployment stays ~10% by August which I expect, there will be plenty of bad news circling to revisit lows when 20 million are at risk of homelessness.\n\nI get it, I\u2019m a retard and didn\u2019t consider BRRRR, TA, stock market controlled by top 1%, corporate socialism. Just providing the common folk pitchfork defense why your puts were too early, and attached an article that I haven\u2019t read.\n\nSide Note: I know a guy who works at BA and the defense/sattelites/space side is booming, commercial has slowed down, but back log is still there, plus most cancelled contracts are really on hold until conditions approve. So basically, by time conditions approve, Boeing will have not even eaten into the backlog of commercial aircraft while still growing defense contracts YoY. For people that don\u2019t understand a 10 yr backlog, Boeing doesnt get final %50 payment until jet delivery, when the max software gets FAA cert, expect these things to drop like hotcakes and for an earnings quarter it will rain green. Fair value is around $315/share, when things return to normal this will rocket.\n\nSpy 8/21 240p\n\n[Why stock market has not crashed](https://www.google.com/amp/s/nymag.com/intelligencer/amp/2020/04/why-hasnt-the-stock-market-crashed-even-more.html)", "created_utc": 1587262091.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g3zoiq/why_the_market_2nd_leg_down_lies_ahead/", "is_self": true}
