{"id": "clh6d7", "title": "Best education to beat the markets?", "selftext": "Couple years ago I came into a little over a million in cash (not a happy story how) ,a shit-ton of money for someone who used to save up to get guac on his burrito.  I figured screw this stupid life at least I'm never going to have to have a J-O-B again.  I sent 10 bucks to my local PBS station to keep This Old House on -air and upgraded the cable plan so I could access HGTV and Showtime.  I streamed \"Flip or Flop\" and \"Billions\" and after becoming a home flipping and investment expert entered the markets.  I lost $100k on the house I flipped and about $200k trading (but offset that with the $10k I made investing).  \n\nI pretty much thought I was the only one who could lose so much so fast.  But tonight I found this forum and now I know I'm a fuckn amateur at losing money.  So the obvious questions for anyone who'd like to answer:  what TV shows should I be watching so I can be expert?  Should I ask PBS for my donation back since I got rooked on that deal?  Thanks ahead of time.  I'll take my answers off-air.", "created_utc": 1564826848, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/clh6d7/best_education_to_beat_the_markets/", "is_self": true}
