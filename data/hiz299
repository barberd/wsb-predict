{"id": "hiz299", "title": "TLRD Due Diligence (and why you should buy tomorrow)", "selftext": "For you neckbeards out there, Jos A Bank and Men's Warehouse are the storefronts TLRD sells its overpriced sandpaper suits made by underage Indonesian laborers and pushed by depressed lonely salesman who don't know what tendies are. When you needed a suit rental to wear to your custody hearing from your recent divorce, this is where you want. It's where most autists got their first suit. We've all probably had a prom rental suit from them you jizzed in at some point in your life. \n\nTLRD 2022 bonds can be bought for +- $11-$14 (as in 11-14 cents on the dollar). Their par value is $100. The current actual yield on them is around 54% annually. They are priced, honestly, for some outcome somehow worse than bankruptcy because autists applaud BK nowadays aka the company could hertz it. But this is very unlikely. News has hammered this share price recently and it's unfounded rumor mongering (although some likelihood of BK is fair). \n\nTheir bond payment is due tomorrow. As long as they make it (they will) this will see a big pop. \n\nTLRD has enough cash (201 million) to ride out at least 6 months with no income. There is something left on their credit facility as well. 90%+ of their stores have now reopened. There is a +- 40% short float (spell short squeeze) and like 100 other reasons why the risk/reward is misplaced here. I'd say there is a 10% chance this goes to 0; the debt on their balance sheet is fucking disgusting but they will figure that shit out. By EOY this will be in the +- $2.50 range, but the 2022 bonds are the sexiest play ever right now.\n\nIf you can get the bonds, get the bonds. If not, buy the common (it's priced so damn cheap) and if you want to go full retard load up on $1 calls.\n\nTL;DR buy TLRD, buy TLRD 7/17 $1 Calls, Buy TLRD July 2022 7% Bonds, buy longer-dated calls.", "created_utc": 1593560485.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hiz299/tlrd_due_diligence_and_why_you_should_buy_tomorrow/", "is_self": true}
