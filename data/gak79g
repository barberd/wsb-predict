{"id": "gak79g", "title": "Are we about to see a massive economic collapse in the state of Nevada?", "selftext": "First off, I would like to say I have no heart in hoping for the demise of anybody even though I've been personally screwed by the big green dildo this market has given us. That said, there are some economic inevitabilities that are doomed to play out at this point, and it seems we'll see it first or near first play out in Nevada.\n\nWhen looking over google trends, I noticed something interesting with the words for 'forbearance,' 'unemployment,' and 'eviction.' On a country wide basis, many of those terms peaked interest at the end of march and have return to typical search level interest levels. But in Nevada? Those interest levels are at their all time highs.\n\nInteresting and perhaps a clue of a larger issue, but nothing more than a tidbit now, right? So let's dive a little further.\n\nWhere does much of Nevada's economy exist? Well, based on population, Las Vegas has 21% of Nevada's population. Why don't we assume that LV represents anywhere from 30-40% of the Nevada economy.\n\nLas Vegas depends on tourism for their income. Well, tourism doesn't exist right now, and most likely it will not exist until End of June at the earliest. Why do I say this? Because airlines such as Delta, Southwest, and United have all remarkably said the same thing: we expect 90-95% of last year's demand for this quarter to be wiped out this quarter. This makes something like tourism untenable for this second quarter.\n\nNow, we're seeing companies like WYNN, LVS, and MGM taking out debt and reducing costs. Okay. Good. They'll survive a year of stopping and restarting. But the problem now is: most of these companies will not be seeing real pre-covid levels of traffic until spring 2021 realistically. So they will not be hiring back as many furloughed workers as assumed. Naturally, we can assume many people in Nevada have filed for unemployment. And when you look at the numbers across western states, you'll notice that Nevada's numbers were relatively similar to other west coasts states up to March, where they've diverged higher from other state's rises in unemployment.\n\nRent and cost of living in Nevada is 127.5% the average standard in the US. LV actually costs less to live in at 118.2% believe it or not. So while this is all happening, Las Vegas has to pay more to just to take care of the bills. Not a good recipe\n\nThis is all interesting data, but perhaps the most concerning bit was the Las Vegas mayor's CNN interview. She offered her city up as an experiment for how a city could deal with the virus aggressively re-opening.\n\nMany people cried out she was putting lives in danger. But I see something different: I see a mayor who is likely getting calls everyday from her constituents who are out of work, out of money, and now looking to get thrown out of their homes. No, she's not acting stupid. She's acting desperate. She understands that her city is in real trouble.\n\nLas Vegas historically does well in times of economic prosperity and poorly in times of economic contraction. But what about a major contraction? \n\nPut another way: We have a negative feedback loop. The state is paying out massive unemployment benefits while its revenue has collapsed (happening not just in Nevada but I'm sure it's more extreme.) So as revenues fall for the state, the state has to pay more out to its citizens so they can survive. What does this mean? Good luck with hiring a full police force with the $2 you have left in your state coffers.\n\nWhile markets have dislocated from the real economy, the real economy gets worse every day. We need to see real policy change or we're doomed to fall into a depression.\n\nI don't have positions. But if you want some:\nSPY 220p 9/18, WYNN 50p 1/21/22", "created_utc": 1588202423.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gak79g/are_we_about_to_see_a_massive_economic_collapse/", "is_self": true}
