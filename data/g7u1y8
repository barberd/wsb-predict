Friday morning I got an email from TDA telling me that I had options expiring that day so I made sure to close out my SPY options but I completely forgot about my put because I knew ZM was zooming. Well ZM crashed and I ended up ITM and my put was exercised. I'm now short 100 shares of ZM with a short balance 5x greater than my net liquidating value. I'm fully expecting ZM to moon on Monday and fuck me in the ass.\n\nAMA about what it's like to be retarded.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/KzUvKfv", "created_utc": 1587823595.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7u1y8/im_going_to_get_zoomed/", "is_self": true}
