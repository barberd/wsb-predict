China effectively quarantining 200 million people and notice how their graph tapered off. Before it was on a parabolic growth trajectory.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow let's zoom in on wtf is going on with that \"Other countries\" graph at the bottom.\n\nExhibit 2:\n\n [https://imgur.com/a/fvYUa1S](https://imgur.com/a/fvYUa1S) \n\nOh shit. What the fuck do we know. It's going parabolic. I've been paying very close attention to this graph the last couple of weeks hoping it would show some sign of tapering off. Nope. Unless the rest of the world does something as insane as what China did, we are not curbing this parabolic growth.\n\nSo again.
