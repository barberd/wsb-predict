{"id": "ggircv", "title": "Argentina Default", "selftext": "Argentina\u2019s possible default has been obvious for years. Argentina seems to like to default as they do it a lot. The country has debt as percentage of GDP above 90%. Obviously there is no money to pay off that debt and this has been obvious even before the coronavirus. Then Argentina decided to go on an aggressive lockdown for covid, costing the government largely. Recently Argentina has been in talks with its creditors and bond holders about restructuring its debt. The conditions they offered were shit for the bond holders, so no deal was reached. On May 22 they have $500 million payment due. Even before covid was around it was highly unlikely that they were going to pay. Now though, there is basically zero chance they can do anything but default. No one seems to want to save them again. Argentina is the r/wallstreetbets of the world economies, you alway have to inverse it. I\u2019m not much of an economist but Argentina is fucked. Expect a default on May 22.\n\nPositions: GGAL 6/19 7.5p\nARGT 6/19 19p\n\nI know these are very low volume but it\u2019s the best I could find for Argentine stocks. ARGT is the ETF for Argentina and GGAL is a Bank.\n\nEdit: forgot to mention they do also heavily rely on the oil industry and have even tried making the  oil price $45 within the country", "created_utc": 1589042609.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ggircv/argentina_default/", "is_self": true}
