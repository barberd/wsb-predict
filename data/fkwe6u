Hence TIF is now trying to break through the $110 support line.\n\nKeep your eyes peeled because Tiffany can be in for a bad ride (which is good for puts).\n\nI recommend 6/19 $85p because there's a lot of open interest. HOWEVER, LVMH agreed to buy them out in mid 2020. Thus, you're betting on them not following through.\n\nThus, a great bet would be anything after mid 2020, but the premiums are extremely expensive.\n\nIf you can get puts for 2021 anywhere from $120 to $60 then I think that would be a good bet. Look at how Tiffany has performed in the 08' recession AND the dot com bust. You may start to think that paying for the premiums is a good idea. This is a long term play, but a goodie.  \n\n\nEDIT: Some people are saying that LVMH may or may not hold up their deal. If they don't, then I think 6/19 $85p are great. Here's the options calculator for it: [http://opcalc.com/4PH](http://opcalc.com/4PH).   \nI wanted to add this edit/comment because I wanted to point out something with a lot of open interest and something somewhat affordable since the other options have high premiums.
