Summary of those points:\n\nCompany has been around for 20 years and still unprofitable, fundamentals are weak, growth is not great, no moat, and Qualtrics is choking them.\n\nThe short % of shares outstanding is only like 2% (4.3% of float), volume on the stock has been low, and there's little discussion about them recently. I think they are more grossly overvalued than other recent IPOs with higher short interest like LYFT or SNAP and deserve more attention. \n\nThey are reporting earnings tomorrow after market closes, maybe volume will pick up then or there will be some analyst updates following. Last earnings were fairly volatile falling 20% intraday but it recovered pretty quickly on no news and has been on a big uptrend since then.
