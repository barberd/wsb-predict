{"id": "b2oq6p", "title": "SPY Day Trade mini-DD", "selftext": "So for you Spergs that have the AM to trade I want to just share a quite obviously day trading strategy that requires real time quotes, an understanding of intraday levels, &amp; balls of steel (unless you're a stop loss tard).\n\nLook at SPY chart on the daily. Instead of gambling &amp; holding SPY calls overnight (which I still do sometimes when I predict daily/weekly/monthly moves) I've found it can be just as rewarding -again if you have the time, real-time quotes, &amp; an inclination for yolo- to day trade SPY. The logic is that SPY has been inversing itself in the first hour or so of trading recently which can bring huge gains on options about to expire. Basically you buy slightly OTM options (&lt;$1) w/ expiry either the next day or the day you're trading at the low, and sell high.\n\nYeah. Obviously this is risky AF as theta seriously works against you and if SPY doesn't rise or fall fast enough you're screwed, not to mention if it goes the wrong way. A stop loss isn't a bad idea but gaps will hurt as well as the fact that you dont want to sell down 20% only to have it go up 100% (which happens all the time).\n\nAn example is today (or all last week...) SPY challenged 282.50 for the second time at approx 11am (bit later than usual) and I had my market order of 200 shares (fidelity's limit) ready to go on 282p. I wound up not executing because I wasn't positive of action, last monday we mooned and wasn't sure how today/this week would trade, if we would be held back by fed on weds, along with BA &amp; FB selloff (obviously we were and there's a reason why I'm on r/wsb). I wasn't about to lose 6k trading SPY on a Monday without real conviction (aka market feels).\n\nS0 bUy HIgH $eLL l0W RiGhT?\n\n", "created_utc": 1552946411, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b2oq6p/spy_day_trade_minidd/", "is_self": true}
