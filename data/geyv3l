{"id": "geyv3l", "title": "The Market is Rigged (Oil Tankers Explained)", "selftext": "Picture this: You're the market maker, one of the big boys. Tanker stocks are all the rage with their sweet, juicy dividends and you want a piece of the pie, so you load up on well over a million shares. Fast forward to literally anytime that isn't 2008, and you get burned. Badly. Stonks are down. But whatever, you're rich as fuck anyways so you'll have to downgrade from five hooker yachts to four. Hey, look on the bright side, you own 55% of the outstanding shares in the entire tanker sector! Well you gotta make your profits somehow, so you start selling OTM covered calls for a **fucking decade** in an industry you know is dying to continue covering your losses, and while the dividends aren't super high, they do provide a little extra income.\n\nFast forward again, this time to March of 2020: Saudi Arabia and Russia simultaneously booty bang WTI (Oil) to record lows with bigly pumps, which combined with the lack of demand from kung flu, creates a super contango so bad we end up with negative oil prices. This is the perfect opportunity for you, the market maker, to see some return on your tanker shares! After hodling for a whole decade and writing options to ignorant gamblers in a borderline dead industry, you begin to grip the bag with a raging vengeance.\n\nOne month later, it seems like the smoothbrains who day trade bio-tech penny stocks have [found out](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gd01t7/serious_on_the_oil_demand_crisis_and_why_you/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) about the oil tankers play, and they're eating up your calls like hot cakes sending the CP ratio to 10:1. You understand that tankers are going to have [great earnings](https://www.yahoo.com/news/scorpio-tankers-stng-q1-earnings-120512118.html) and [stellar guidance](https://twitter.com/calvinfroedge/status/1258020723722981386) this quarter, so there's no fucking way you're selling your shares at a discount to these retards.\n\nOperation rugpull is a go, fuck the fundamentals, you HAVE to sell those shares until they drop to the loins of hell. SEC hasn't investigated market manipulation after orange hitler allocated all the funds to the [space force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Space_Force) (but hey, at least we don't have space commies hijacking the media to take away MUH guns & freedom!) Who's going to stop you? Who gives a shit if you go on margin? You're a market maker, margin goes on you. Sell Sell Sell. You own the EVERYTHING. After retail sees share prices drop at circuit breaker levels for two consecutive days before earnings, they'll have to sell their shares like the weak paper-handed downie babies they are.\n\nAs an example, in order to prevent a single call for $STNG from expiring ITM, the share price has to be below $16 on May 15th. At this rate, we'll reach that in no time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[MAXIMUM PAIN](https://preview.redd.it/xkgps5veg9x41.png?width=1348&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6b95ea9f8a99ce4b2dbb3a6ead1abdbe000b61d)\n\nP.S. I know that the outlook on tankers for medium-long term is pretty poor with the whole \"oil demand recovery\", but regardless of that we shouldn't be seeing a stock that trades at 0.6x it's net asset value with awesome earnings & guidance like this free fall. Tankers will be printing money into Q3 no matter your opinion. The rates are locked in for a decent portion of companies.\n\nTLDR: Market's rigged. Stop buying calls. You're only making the situation worse. Average down and buy shares/leaps. If someone has a better explanation for what happened the past two days then I'm all ears.", "created_utc": 1588821563.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/geyv3l/the_market_is_rigged_oil_tankers_explained/", "is_self": true}
