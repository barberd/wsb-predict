{"id": "fcvfu1", "title": "WSB activist investing to solve the Robinhood problem", "selftext": "Hear me out,\n\nLots of money was lost yesterday because we couldn't access Robinhood, it's clear a real solution is needed.\n\nPaul Singer and his hedge fund Eliott Management have been buying up large amount of shares from companies and shaking shit up, leading to massive changes within these companies. Most recently, they've bought up significant share in Twitter and are pushing for Jack Dorsey to be fired. \n\nWSB is gaining traction, and more and more degens are joining every day. With the recent Robinhood crash, it's clear we need our own platform. Here's the play:\n\n1. Grind tendies together for a month or two, keep doing what we're doing.\n2. Pool together all of our cash in The Retard Fund\u00ae.\n3. Buy up a significant portion of E-trade (ETFC). 10% of E-trade would be 1.035B at this price, with enough YOLOs and gains we could do it.\n4. Push their CEO out, get a WSB admin or mod in as their new leader.\n5. Turn e-trade into an options trading platform focused on FDs and autism.\n6. Tendies.\n\nI'm open to suggestions on what changes to make to E-trade once we get in power, or what other alternative companies we could buy and shake up together. WSB will be a force to be reckoned with.", "created_utc": 1583246195, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fcvfu1/wsb_activist_investing_to_solve_the_robinhood/", "is_self": true}
