I see SPY potentially reaching as high as $275 by Wednesday before dropping back down until mid May. A worst case scenario is $SPY 210, I believe this is also the bottom. \n\nYou can see **predicted peak occurring in May-June** from latest imperial college models. This aligns with current white house directive:\n\n[\\[1A\\] Peak from WH guidance](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ETawwv1WkAIqMYp?format=jpg&name=medium)\n\n[\\[1B\\] Peak from imperial college model \\(very aggressive model\\)](https://imgur.com/a/HxnBmQl)\n\nChina, Hong Kong, South Korea all appear to have **hit market bottom at the peaks**. It is possible we hit bottom however at Italy's peak due to sentiment. \n\n[\\[2A\\] International Recoveries](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ETaxCF2XgAYTQMb?format=jpg&name=medium)\n\nA key thing to look for and probably the most important moving forward is Italy's data, from there we will have a better idea on what will happen. In the WH conference this morning, they had mentioned a much more precise model coming with 5 days more of data (heavily biased towards Italy and France). US median age is younger which is good for us, but we have higher obesity rate. Since COVID-19 puts enormous stress on cardiovascular system specifically, we will likely end up like Italy or slightly worse even with lower population ageage. \n\nItaly may be reaching max testing capacity which can create a false flattening curve, so it's too early to judge. \n\n[Latest Italy data](https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/bollettino/Infografica_18marzo%20ENG.pdf)\n\n_____________________________________\nKEY LEVELS:\n\n* **$SPY 210** or lower is extremely bearish \n\n* **$SPY 215-220** is likely bottom\n\n* **$SPY 275** is bullish long term\n\n\n[Chart idea](https://imgur.com/a/7G9bTG0)\n\n\n\n\n_____________________________________\n\nReferences:\n\n[1A/B] https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf\n\n[2A]  https://twitter.com/fundstrat/status/1240373958832259073/photo/1\n\n\n**TLDR:** Things getting worse, SPY will bounce big but we probably haven't see the bottom yet.", "created_utc": 1584579948.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fl124i/dd_large_rally_and_drop_likely_coming/", "is_self": true}
