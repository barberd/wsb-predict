It seems so obvious earnings will be good that I am thinking its too good to be true", "selftext": "So Netflix, a company which just reached a new all time high due to everyone staying at home cause of the rona virus doing nothing but NFLXINGNCHILLIN caused massive amounts of people to buy the stock, because, well, it makes sense just like buying Clorox and Zoom during a worldwide stay at home order due to a pandemic. People home bored out of their minds equals lots more people spending hours watching Netflix\n\nNow, just because their stock is doing good and we know people are watching Netflix, we do not know how many people went out and bought a subscription. Many people already had one. It seems obvious that earnings will be good but, I can't shake the feeling that it's \"almost too good to be true\"\n\nBuying calls/puts the day before earnings is released is fucking stupid due to high ass I.V. which plummets as soon as the report comes out. This is why spreads are the way.\n\nI think Netflix will have good earnings and go up, hence why I think a put credit spread is a good idea.\n\nAre any of you guys playing earnings? Really, I should have just played the run up to them with calls... Thought it was already overbought and did not expect such massive movement. Live and learn. Still want to make tendies tho\n\nLets here your plays, autists!!", "created_utc": 1587406302.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g4y0av/nflx_earnings_thinking_of_a_put_credit_spread_any/", "is_self": true}
