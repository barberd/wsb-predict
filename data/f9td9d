{"id": "f9td9d", "title": "The Bottom Is Near", "selftext": "Now that I am seeing a lot of these so called \"bulls\" reveal their true homosexual bear like nature, I got a message to both the Bears and the real Bulls\n\nBears: You guys are idiots if you think this Corona virus is the catalyst for the global recession. This virus is nothing more than a variation of the common flu. Even at its highest peak with all the media frenzy, China is already starting to re-open its factories, implementing monetary and fiscal policies to shore up its economy to stage a rebound in GDP growth, and firms like Apple has already begun         \nre-opening its stores. What you are witnessing right now is the accumulation of fear and other irrationalities that will only be amplified by algo-trading. Essentially speaking, you are betting on a short term event having a greater impact on the economy than it probably ever could in reality and getting complacent with those puts without looking past the fear. \n\nBulls: Hold strong. This virus is nothing more than a flu that will most likely blow over come spring. Don't fall to the fear selling and media fear mongering. The global economy has faced worse pandemics before in the past and still came out mostly unscathed. China is once again increasing output by reopening factories and already growth of new cases in the country has dropped off significantly. Whats more is that the backdrop is still there to support elevated equity prices. This include low rates, QE, strong consumer spending, and rising corporate profits in the tech sector. There will be some short term pain as bears gather and circle jerk each other but then just increase your exposure to gold calls and get long dated calls on SPY and QQQ since now they are cheap. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr: Bears are retarded if they think this virus is gonna bring in a recession since we faced pandemics before in the past and this flue will probably go away come spring when flu season ends. Bulls get gold calls to hedge against short term pain and increase exposure to long dated calls on QQQ and SPY to profit when inevitably dies down.", "created_utc": 1582724446, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9td9d/the_bottom_is_near/", "is_self": true}
