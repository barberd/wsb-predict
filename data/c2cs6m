Press conference with J Pow is scheduled at 2pm but you want to react if there is a leak sooner.  You can also watch it live at the link below.  You should tee up your orders prior to the news so that you can submit them quickly.  We're going to have a lot of volatility tomorrow.  Big gain day. I have $600k in options in play.  Bout all these OTM with low IV and ready to cash them in.  Boner time.\n\n* RIG190712C6\n* KR190621P25\n* TSM190621P40\n* BBBY190621P12\n* BB190621C8.5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.federalreserve.gov/live-broadcast.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/live-broadcast.htm)", "created_utc": 1560920297, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c2cs6m/tip_for_fomc_news_tomorrow/", "is_self": true}
