SPY 80p-180p and UPRO hedge", "selftext": "**TL:DR** Buying shares in UPRO to hedge against far otm SPY puts 180p - 80p that i'm gonna buy after fed meeting. 1k in UPRO = 1k in far otm spy puts after fed meeting.\n\nThis is some big short type shit, which may seem hard to believe because of how far we've already fallen, but listen.\n\nWe've fallen 27% from our ATH in SPY to our most recent low. That's a hell of a fall, but we haven't even gone back to the lows of december 2018. If this virus is an actual problem (which it will be), and lasts any length of time (which it will, vaccine 1yr or further away according to anyone that matters) then this makes no fucking sense.\n\nLook at the vix. We've reached a peak 76, when in 2008 it peaked at 96. Obviously 2008 was much worse but let's continue, the point is this isn't an unprecedented level of fear. One thing to note is VIX peaked and we continue to go lower for a little while after.\n\nThe only times we've convincingly gone through the 200 weekly moving average, was during 2008 and the dot com bubble bursting. We've just now gone through the 200 wma and things haven't even shut down yet. What happens when people don't go out for 2 months or more?\n\nIf you haven't been under a fucking rock then you know that the velocity of this 'crash' is crazy. We've never gone down this fast, and markets tend to overshoot the bottom. We'll often go much lower than makes sense, and spike back up from that point, continuing to slowly go up from there. I believe based on the velocity that we have already seen, that we will overshoot the bottom even harder than normal for a relatively short time.\n\nOn SPX the next testing points are 2100/1800/1600/800 assuming we continue lower from here. What stops us from going lower? Well in the short term, it's government response. In the long term, it's just time. Enough people getting infected, vaccine development, etc. Businesses aren't gonna have no traffic for 6 months, but there's nothing that can be done about them having close to 0 traffic for 1-3 months.\n\nBefore today Spy 80p jun 19 puts were $0.15 each. After today's bounce they'll be much cheaper, and if i'm right, then after congress comes together with whatever shit they have & the fed meeting, they'll be even cheaper. Stupid people will think everything's fine. Volatility will shit the bed (relatively) and the options will be even cheaper.\n\nNow some basic math. UPRO hit $80 at its ATH. 32.75 right now, which means there's about a 144% increase from here back to ath. The best part, is it's volatility proof. Your call won't get fucked by volatility plummeting into the earth. You'll just print money. I know 144% isn't a lot for gains posting autists here, but most people posts gains one day and then $ROPE when they lose it all. I don't sell nor invest in companies that sell ropes so I have no interest in doing it.\n\nHere's how it breaks down\n\nLet's say we buy $1000 of far otm spy puts that will go to 0 unless we continue to crash. You hedge (I know foreign concept for most of you) against it with $1000 in UPRO shares. 144% upside back to ath if we have a V recovery, and massive, massive downside potential with the puts (can't give % because it depends on the price. Fed bounce might just bring 80p down to close to $0.01, hard to guess)\n\n$1000 far otm spy puts jun 19\n\n$1000 upro shares.\n\n**V recovery?** You make up for your loss on spy puts with the gains on upro.\n\n**Move sideways after fed bounce?** You eventually make up the money from upro shares. No time decay no volatility crush, you're safe.\n\n**Continue to crash after bounce and people actually get panicked? (80+ vix, testing 2100/1800)** Your puts print more money than the fucking fed partly thanks to vol boost. AND you keep your fucking upro shares which will eventually end up back to ath (even if it takes year+)\n\nI'm normally retarded but this feels like the autistic trade of the year and i'm trying to find a reason not to do it. I doubt i'll think of one so i'll post ss when I make the position.\n\n**I smell money.**", "created_utc": 1584099835.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhyc2q/autistic_dd_ta_and_big_brain_play_spy_80p180p_and/", "is_self": true}
