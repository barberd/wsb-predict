But I found this in a crypto newsletter this morning: \n\nFrom Arthur Hayes at Bitmex Research: \n\n\"Bitcoin is a monetary asset, and the flow of money and credit is crucial to understanding how the price will perform in the future. The Fed and PBOC are committed to increasing the size of their balance sheets in 2019, that is positive for Bitcoin.  \n   \nThe reason I focus more on China is the scale of credit creation each year dwarfs any country ever in human history. The other important consideration is Chinese people have no illusion about what is actually happening. Unlike their American counterparts, ordinary Chinese people do not trust the government.  \n   \nAmericans love America. Walk around an American and city, and you will see countless people wearing American flag paraphernalia. Walk around a Chinese city, and you are more likely to see a Balenciaga handbag than someone rocking the Chinese flag as a fashion statement.  \n   \nChina has devalued and revalued the Yuan multiple times since the early 1980s. This is not lost on the population. The PBOC has kept the Yuan relatively stable since early 2017. They even made moves to actually tighten credit conditions. However, the trade war changed all that, and now they are printing money like it\u2019s 2008. That pressure will build around the exchange rate, and at some point, either the PBOC tightens credit and slows GDP growth, or devalues.  \n   \nChinese asset holders are not stupid. They see the writing on the wall, and as the CNY has recently crept higher towards the magical 7.00, Bitcoin exited the doldrums and more than doubled.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe wrinkle in 2019 is that the major Chinese exchanges no longer offer Bitcoin / CNY trading. Now Chinese traders must obtain Bitcoin in the Chinese OTC markets. Make no mistake, just because you don\u2019t see Okcoin and Huobi putting up big volume numbers in China, doesn\u2019t mean they have stopped serving the Chinese market. The OTC market is vibrant, and these venues have found politically acceptable ways to allow buyers and sellers to meet in China.  \n   \nZhao Dong, arguably the largest OTC trader in China, is one of the main people responsible for the successful $1bn Bitfinex LEO IEO. He went on the record supporting Bitfinex to the Chinese crypto community, and his clout and network helped Bitfinex win back the Chinese traders. China still matters.  \n   \nThe key number is 7.00. If the PBOC allows the Yuan to break this level, ordinary Zhou\u2019s will scramble to get their hands on Bitcoin and other cryptos. Similar to 2015, a sharp and sudden Yuan depreciation could lead to the beginning of another epic bull market.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIncludes some charts, but I can't import images in WSB anymore. Good luck, whether you believe in the yuan, the USD or the bitcoins. For what it's worth, I think that this political moment in history is Trump's effort to destroy the Communist Party of China by targeting China''s economy so that it collapses in on itself. That's why he's not trying to get a deal. He will delay for as long as he can to see the communist party eat itself.", "created_utc": 1558669818, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bscaax/the_trade_war_is_really_about_weakening_the_yuan/", "is_self": true}
