In my opinion, the potential here outweighs the risks. Other industries have been grabbing most of the attention over the past few months (and rightfully so), but once we start to see the film industry start to work its way back to its $140 billion/year status quo, I believe we will see much higher volume.   Buying the underlying is also a good choice here tbh if you don't want to mess with options.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**About Avid**\n\nAvid is a premiere manufacturer of multimedia production tools in the film and music industries. I work in a major motion picture studio and have firsthand experience with how prevalent Avid's products are in the industry. Since the 90s, Avid's Media Composer editing software has been and will be for the foreseeable future the dominant leader in Non-Linear Editing systems. Proficiency in Avid is a non-negotiable requirement if you ever want to get into editing in the Film and Television industry.\n\nIn addition to dominating the Film & TV industries, they created and own a piece of software called Pro Tools, which is the industry standard for music production.\n\nIn addition two these two flagship products, they sell computer hardware and peripherals to support their software and other production tools. These are two multi-billion dollar industries that rely on AVID as an integral part of production.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why now?**\n\nEveryone and their mother who has been at home and ever had the slightest interest in creating music has taken advantage of their free time to start. They turn to Pro Tools. With music production having gone remote, studios and producers can no longer work in the same studio and server, and have now had to increase their number of subscriptions so everyone can work remotely. Same goes for any film productions that still had operations going on after COVID, i.e. animation, live TV shows, and any productions that were in their post production stages. The number of subscriptions has increased drastically. At the same time, Avid's products work on a subscription structure that encourages an upfront 12-month purchase, meaning they haven't forfeited revenue from production delays.\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti announced on June 10th that Film and TV production will be allowed to resume starting June 12th. Traders clearly saw this coming before the morning of the 10th as there was a 15% run shortly prior. However, film production doesn't happen without production insurance companies that have caught up with figuring how to insure against COVID. Once that happens, production will start to resume in extremely large numbers. And even when things do resume, nothing will be the same. COVID has changed the media production industry permanently, and companies have seen how efficient and cost-effective it can be to work from home when it's not integral to the job.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Juicy stuff**\n\nInvestment group Impactive Capital ([see their leadership here](https://www.impactivecapital.com/team)) has added more than 2 million shares in the past month, bringing their total investment in Avid to 6,770,000 shares, or around $51 million. IC has a portfolio of 233 million, meaning Avid is more than 20% of their investment and climbing. IC is extremely bullish on Avid and isn't showing signs of slowing their rate of acquisition.\n\nLooking at Avid's insider activity [here](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/avid/insider-activity) , we see 41 buys and 11 sells in the last month. You might also notice that it appears more shares were sold than bought through this period, but further examination reveals that those 5,000,000 shares sold were part of a transfer among Blum Capital Partners and its entities, not a sell into the market (see details [here](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/847243/000165260820000003/xslF345X03/edgar.xml)) . Accounting for this, we have 3,000,000 shares bought and only 60,000 sold in the last three months.\n\nOn top of this, the mean analyst price target for Avid is around $10.50, more than 40% upside, with the high target of 14 bring nearly 100% upside. Nasdaq rates it a [strong buy](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/avid/analyst-research).\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n1. Smart people are getting in\n2. Production is resuming\n3. Weathering COVID very well\n4. SoundCloud producers are out in full force.\n\n**Positions**\n\nCareful with bid/ask spreads here. I would advise watching volumes and waiting for a high volume day to get in this week. This is not a play for soggy, wet, paper hands. \n\n7/17 7.5c,\n\n10/16 7.5c, 10c\n\nShares\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nDo your own DD and decide for yourself how much risk you can handle.
