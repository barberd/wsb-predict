{"id": "fawvbs", "title": "KMB - Bearvirus panic winner", "selftext": "OK, so me and my coworkers stayed up all night trying to figure out what company that's going to make a ton off money off of coronavirus that wasn't already up in the market.\n\nObviously APT already skyrocketed, and even MMM went up a little the last two days. MMM is too large to really go up just on mask sales. But there's a company that doesn't just make masks but makes ALL the stuff you need to survive coronavirus. \n\n[Kimberly Clark is the \\*\\*third largest N95 mask manufacturer\\*\\*](https://www.thomasnet.com/articles/top-suppliers/surgical-mask-manufacturer-suppliers/) by sales revenue. So that's a pretty obvious boost to mask sales, whatever.\n\nBut what happens to all the people who get coronavirus and AREN'T sick enough to be hospitalized? They sit at home coughing and blowing their nose into KLEENEX TISSUES. Only 20% or less of people with coronavirus get sick enough to need a hospital-everyone else is just at home using endless Kleenex.\n\nPeople are also **panic buying hand sanitizer**. Hand sanitizer is sold out on [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com), all the local store shelves are empty of Purell (seriously, I checked Targets everywhere and even the stores claiming that it's in stock don't have it because they got kleptoed). [KMB is also a huge manufacturer of hand sanitizer](https://www.kcprofessional.com/en-us/products/skin-care-dispensers/hand-sanitizer) for both consumers and commercial facilities.\n\nSo we have a company that literally makes MASKS, HAND SANITIZER, and TISSUES but hasn't spiked in price yet. Sales of half the crap they make are going nuts. They're too large of a company to have a batshit run like APT but I can see this going back up to to the $150's when the public realizes KMB is selling half the shit people are hoarding during an outbreak.", "created_utc": 1582905767, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fawvbs/kmb_bearvirus_panic_winner/", "is_self": true}
