{"id": "gfuh67", "title": "CVNA up 10%", "selftext": "I sold a condor on this company, and it was within my strikes this morning.  today it decides to go up 10% for absolutely no reason.  Earnings was 3 days ago.  They posted a loss.  They have never made a profit.  They likely  never will.  Their market cap is 17 billion dollars.  Their assets are 2 billion and their liabilities are 1.87 billion.  They have 98 million in equity, so they are trading at 170 times book value.  Since they lost over a hundred million last year, they'll probably have negative equity by next month.  If you mark down their used car inventory, they're actually insolvent.  I actually like their model and I like the company, but come on.  This is a bubble.", "created_utc": 1588949095.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gfuh67/cvna_up_10/", "is_self": true}
