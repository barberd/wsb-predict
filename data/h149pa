I am here to reassure that the Media narrative being spun is FUD, and anyone who fearmongers is a PEDO GUY. I am going to use FACTS and DATA to CRUSH the doubters. \n\nDaily confirmed cases in US is trending DOWN WITH A TINY UPTICK over last week.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/GTRpv3b\n\nYes, there's a small uptick over last week, but with the mass protests occurring now two weeks ago, the notion that we are going to see runaway exponentials beginning again looks extremely unlikely -- a tiny little bump which won't repeat because the protests and the ending of the lockdowns are factors that won't repeat. So we are fine, I'd bet anything and am.\n\nConfirmed deaths looks even better, a straight line downward -- this makes sense too. People are enjoying the sunshine again, higher Vitamin D levels are protecting people.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gBX5weQ\n\nSource on Vitamin D: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-21211/v1\n\nVitamin D is not technically a Vitamin, but a hormone. It protects against viruses, it increases your testosterone levels and protects against obesity and health problems. One of the reasons African-Americans are susceptible to the 'rona is lower vitamin D, also obesity which is itself partly a result of lower Vitamin D. Being low D is the same as being low T.\n\n\nWe can see there are some countries having problems with the 'rona -- Brazil, India are the two biggest. One locked down and the other didn't (Totalitarianism doesn't work!). Both are poor countries with mega-slums. Both are equatorial nations which is why their spike took longer to happen. In the US, most of our people who were highly susceptible to the virus already got infected during the Winter which is why our Summer is looking so good. Brazilians are less rule-abiding than Indians which is why they have a bigger number.\n\nThe seasonal impact from this virus is now undeniable. Countries with exponential curves right now are all equatorial or Southern hemisphere, northern hemisphere is looking fantastic.\n\nThat unfortunately means that there WILL be a second wave in the fall. Make sure you TAN, get the SUNSHINE, make sure you LIFT. Make sure you take Vitamin D to INGEST SUNSHINE IN PILL FORM.\n\nMake sure you stay within six feet of ROBINHOOD USERS and anyone who buys HTZ or CHK and take off your mask and breathe directly into their faces. Let's make the market efficient again!\n\nToday I sold my puts up 40%. I am usually always wrong on my market timing, but that being said:\n\nWe have a V-shaped recovery and an unlimited money printer so I would continue to err on the side of bullishness. I fully believe we continue to set all-time highs in the coming weeks. This is a bear trap!
