Based on his Technical Analysis it seems like the pattern is bullish.Chart : [https://imgur.com/gallery/LzndcWc](https://imgur.com/gallery/LzndcWc)If you would like to read the whole thing about TA then click on his post here : [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fg2ch8/virt\\_technical\\_analysis\\_bullish\\_2993c\\_522/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fg2ch8/virt_technical_analysis_bullish_2993c_522/)\n\n***ABOUT THE COMPANY***\n\n***$VIRT*** goes up if the volume and volatility is high in the market. It seems like volume and volatility isn't gonna go down especially for the next couple of months. $VIRT appears to inverse SPY movements. When SPY goes up, VIRT goes down and vice versa.\n\nChart : [https://stockcharts.com/freecharts/perf.php?SPY,VIRT](https://stockcharts.com/freecharts/perf.php?SPY,VIRT)\n\n***WHY VIRT WILL CONTINUE RISING***\n\nThanks to u/doctaO for doing a brief research on this Company. I'll try to summarize what he said :\n\n**VIRT** made **$100MM - $105MM** in January, which is around **$5MM** per day in trading income. They also announced that February was about the same\n\n**$VIRT** announced Preliminary results Year to Date through February on March 3.\n\n**Adjusted Net Trading Income  between $230 and $240 million**\n\nAverage Daily Adjusted Net Trading Incomebetween **$5.75 and $6.00 million per day**\n\nSource : [https://ir.virtu.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Virtu-Announces-Preliminary-Results-Year-To-Date-through-Feb-2020/default.aspx](https://ir.virtu.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Virtu-Announces-Preliminary-Results-Year-To-Date-through-Feb-2020/default.aspx)\n\nVirtu can primarily make money with market making in a few different ways.\n\n1. Adding markets.\n2. Adding symbols that they trade.\n3. Increased volatility of the markets.\n4. Increased volume of the markets.\n5. Adding clients to their execution services.\n6. Improving their internal matching.\n7. Increasing their market share of profitable HFT activity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen volume goes up, Virtu makes money by participating in more transactions. When volatility goes up, they make money by making more money per transaction. That's because higher volatility is correlated with a larger spread. A larger spread means they can sell to party A for $1.05 and buy from party B for $1. The spread here is $.05. Typically, the spread is often only $.01.\n\n**Thanks again to**  u/doctaO  **for doing this research.**\n\nu/makepeace12 has also done an amazing DD on $VIRT.\n\nHis DD link : [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fg0hqd/virt\\_dd\\_big\\_brain\\_shit\\_is\\_about\\_to\\_moon/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fg0hqd/virt_dd_big_brain_shit_is_about_to_moon/)\n\n**TL;DR : 4/17 30c & 35c**\n\nMy positions : [https://imgur.com/MREfx8o](https://imgur.com/MREfx8o)", "created_utc": 1583931304.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fgwp6y/virt_thrives_on_volatility/", "is_self": true}
