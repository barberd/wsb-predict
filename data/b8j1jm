{"id": "b8j1jm", "title": "$AAL Unusual 33.5C Option Activity", "selftext": "Yesterday we saw over 20K contracts trade in the weekly 33.5C and 7k actually in OI as of this morning. At 9AM it gapped up to over 33 (not sure what news) but apparently these traders who bought yesterday must have known something was in the works. I am still waiting to see if this gap up holds or if it was a fat finger illiquid trade pre-market. This is why I always think when I see UOA that they might know something and a lot of the times they actually do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/12mbk8evoup21.jpg\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/v6epj8evoup21.png", "created_utc": 1554210723, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b8j1jm/aal_unusual_335c_option_activity/", "is_self": true}
