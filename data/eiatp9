{"id": "eiatp9", "title": "Price of Wheat DD", "selftext": "So the price of Wheat is currently at a low but had been increasing mainly on trade talk news for the past month. The price of grains in general has gone up but wheat seems to perform better in particular.  China doesn't buy much wheat but it's still benefitting from the talks.\n\nNow 2020 is the start or end, however you look at it, of an 11 year solar cycle.  This means potentially more volatility in weather on Earth. Possibly a colder winter, earlier spring, and more drought.  This could lead to a potential crop failure especially for wheat. One article predicts a 40% upside.\n\nAustralia has been on fire and wheat production is down. The USDA predicts a great year for wheat so if it isn't the price could rise significantly.\n\nThe play: you could buy futures but for those of us, including me, that don't have access to futures, $WEAT is an ETF that tracks the futures of wheat. There's also consistent spikes in July, which is why I'm buying July 2020 $5 calls. As always this is one autist's opinion and any plays are at your own risk. Good luck!\n\nTLDR: price of wheat increasing, buy July 2020 $WEAT calls", "created_utc": 1577835957, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eiatp9/price_of_wheat_dd/", "is_self": true}
