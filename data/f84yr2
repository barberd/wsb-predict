They used to be on the OTC and eventually got upgraded onto the NYSE. \n\nEver since Elon decided to build the Gigafactory in Nevada ([here\u2019s](https://youtu.be/ZHeR2-ifbg4)the announcement video) I\u2019ve been pumped, because that\u2019s where LAC is located about 2 hours away. \n\nThe stock has had ups and downs over the years, but that\u2019s purely been on speculation (price of lithium at the time/rumors/etc.) as it actually takes a lot of time to start producing lithium. **They own [Thacker Pass](https://www.lithiumamericas.com/thacker-pass/) which is the largest known lithium deposit in the US.**\n\nThacker Pass is currently working on getting approvals to start breaking ground in Q1 of FY21. Production should start in Q2-Q3 of FY22. If everything goes according to plan, **that mine will be producing between 40,000-60,000 tons of lithium a year for the next 40 years**. \n\nI\u2019ve made numerous posts in /r/investing ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/emjm2s/now_that_the_train_has_left_the_station_im_pissed/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/f2za4z/no_one_here_listened_to_me_about_lithium_americas/) and everyone seems to make fun of me and not care about any research or analysis as they think im trying to *brag* about my position. I also made a post in /r/teslainvestorsclub ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/f6aiz5/will_lithium_americas_lac_get_purchased_by_tesla/) which had a more positive conversation, as they better understand Tesla and EVs than /r/investing does. \n\nI\u2019ve done alot of research and I think this is a mjor player for being acquired or announcing some type exclusive partnership with a major EV Automanufacturer (hopefully Tesla) in the future. Here is their [Year In Review](https://www.lithiumamericas.com/_resources/presentations/LAC-Year-in-Review-Jan-2-2020.pdf) and an interesting interview with their CEO on Bloomberg ([HERE](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/video/lithium-americas-ceo-we-ll-make-money-despite-price-slump%7E1897852)) where he acts very coy about Tesla*knowing* who they are around the 6:43 mark. \n\n[This](https://youtu.be/C6cXu1Ln6rk) video also supports some of my postions and mentioned LAC a few times throughout. Tesla is huge on **vertical integration** and owning this part of the process is key. Not only would it give them control of the largest known lithium deposit in the US, but it could cripple their competitors of lithium for their EVs, essentially owning a major piece of the supply chain. \n\nLet\u2019s not forget, [Britain is banning all gas, diesel and hybrid cars by 2035](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/britain-ban-sale-new-gas-diesel-hybrid-cars-2035-n1129616), so EVs are definitely the future. \n\nYes, all of this speculation, but circumstantial evidence is pretty strong in something happening.\n\n**[LAC IS UP ALMOST 85% IN THE LAST 3 MONTHS!](https://i.imgur.com/D4Dh2nm.jpg)**\n\nI know 99% of the sub wants to get rich quick, and while this doesnt necessrily follow that formula, I believe this stock has legs and there\u2019s going to be a lot of upside in the next few years. \n\nNo, you can\u2019t trade LAC options on Robinhood, maybe you can with another broker, but I\u2019m only buying shares since I\u2019m a fellow autist and only understand the simple charts on Robinhood. \n\nThought I\u2019d throw a couple rocketships in here to keep on trend with the other posts! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "created_utc": 1582434298, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f84yr2/lithium_americas_lac_is_going_to_be_the_next/", "is_self": true}
