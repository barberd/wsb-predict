It will literally blow your socks off and not at the same time. I present to you the Many World Hypothesis. \n\nEssentially it says if an action has more than one possible outcome, the universe splits into two distinct universes to accommodate each of the possible outcomes.\n\nIt\u2019s based on some quantum physics shit that only nerds can understand but you don\u2019t need to know that for the implications \n\nThat deep OTM TSLA Put you went broke on... in another universe daddy Elon shit the bed and you own a yacht. This sub in another universe is filled with millionaires with annualized returns that make Jim Simon\u2019s medallion fund look like an ally savings account. \n\nWe aren\u2019t making the wrong bets.. we are just in the wrong universe. Next time you bet on a stock to go up it will..... it just might be in a different universe \n\nSo basically I guess this really doesn\u2019t change anything.
