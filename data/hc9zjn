{"id": "hc9zjn", "title": "I'm out, autists; don't fight the future if you suck at this", "selftext": "I haven't pretended like I know anything about options; I'm just a political, tech and economic junkie whose good at theoretical thinking. It's been pretty easy to see what was coming after the dip and it's been a lot of fun buying and selling stock to sell for 30-50% profit in the fed and PPT inflated market.\n\nI'm out though, because I have no idea what is going on anymore with anything except tech. I don't plan on getting caught in the eventual crash back down to reality given that corporate debt is 50% of the GDP, commercial real estate is toxic as fuck, 1/3 of Americans missed their home payments and the world going crazy.\n\nBecause here is the thing. If you aren't a tech junkie and haven't been following what's going on, then allow me to clue you in. The prophesied digital revolution has been kicked into high gear.\n\nAll the social media companies and all the big tech companies have bent over backwards to help promote the necessity of the COVID lockdown and spread \"accurate information\". If you think they did this out of their love for humanity, then you are naive. They understood that if you locked everyone in their houses for three months, they would all be forced to use the digital marketplace and turn to digital services for entertainment. And if you can force people to change out of necessity and the changes add substantial benefits to their lives, then they won't ever fully go back to the way it was before.\n\nDon't believe me? Look to your friends and co-workers and ask them how they have been spending their time these last three months. My personal trainer friend started a new digital fitness business and has been doing well. My kickboxing coach started filming his classes and uploading them online as an additional feature of his business. My ESL teacher friend started uploading her lessons on YouTube to make extra cash. My boss at the bank I contract to has stated that he used to be against working from home, but would be going to a mixed model going forward, because of how much it has benefited him.\n\nNone of these people would have done any of this before the COVID lockdown, because they were comfortable in their existing models. \n\nJust look at me. I got let go as a contractor in the panic and I used this as an opportunity to switch to a remote only model as a software engineer. I setup an office, upgraded my digital identity, assembled a good portfolio on github and have started looking solely for remote only or mixed work opportunities. I get to control my time more and make my high productivity work for me, I get two hours back a day from time in traffic to train at kickboxing, I get more time in the evenings to go dates and spend time with my bros and I cook myself fresh food in my kitchen for lunch everyday. When I get remote only thing going and I pay off my mortgage, I plan on jumping from short term rental to short term rental in Europe while working off my laptop.\n\nA brave new world has started and it's going to be a world of getting custom tailored clothes delivered to your doorstep, picking up groceries ordered off apps, buying everything online and future companies of tech and knowledge workers offering a communal workspace for meetings and a work from home tech stack.\n\nI have rebalanced my portfolio around the AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, XSW, CLOU, WCLD and ARKW. This is all big tech, cloud computing, next generation internet and digital services. I've taken my losses on all my stupid speculative shit and put it into AMZN. Bezos is going to take advantage of this massive displacement of cash from all the companies without a digital footprint and use it to grow his company to new heights. It's P/E is insane and I'll remake all my losses in it by the end of the year. The grow I see off all of this will be anything better than I can do thinking I am some character out of the big short.\n\n**TLDR: If you don't know what you are doing with any of this shit, don't keep being dumb with your life savings. There is an amazing investment opportunity going on with the digital revolution.**", "created_utc": 1592604674.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hc9zjn/im_out_autists_dont_fight_the_future_if_you_suck/", "is_self": true}
