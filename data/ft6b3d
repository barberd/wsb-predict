AMD in particular has been acting like it has a God damn beta of .5 and a p/e of 2. Sure they have been stealing market share from intel and coming out with new chips like the ryzen 5,000,000 and sure intel has the gayest sounding chip ever with flaccid lake or whatever it\u2019s called but this stock has got to move down based on what you might ask? I have no fucking clue but with airliners and cruises dropping 20% in a day and poots are returning 23.7% each day it\u2019s isn\u2019t worth the r/r anymore. AMD is down like only 20 something percent and with people out of work who\u2019s buying a new expensive virtually reality jack off center. Someone please enlighten me on why I\u2019m retarded \n\ntldr- April 17th 45p bought at top today that I will probably toilette paper hands sell next up day", "created_utc": 1585767708.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ft6b3d/next_chip_to_fall/", "is_self": true}
