{"id": "hb5adh", "title": "Elliot Wave Analysis and Projections", "selftext": "I know technical ANALysis is not the end all be all, and it should be used along with the rest of the magic crayon indicators and fundamentals. I have attached below a labeled SPY graph and right below that the classic Elliot Wave template. The basic theory is this - markets move in waves and these waves replicate in a similar pattern based on the overall trend. Depending on the time frame you look at, these waves are always repeating themselves within their waves (waveception), from the 1 minute chart all the way up to the 20 year chart and beyond. The classic pattern that Elliot noticed is applicable in bull and bear markets. Waves 1,3, 5 & B are moving with the trend, with waves 2,4, A & C going against the trend, then the trend either continues or reverses. Like with all good technical indicators, it's somewhat of a self fulfilling prophecy because enough people over time have accepted it and believed it, so it became built into how people and their algos trade the markets. \n\n[Entering Wave 3](https://preview.redd.it/zw3tll6vkk551.png?width=1604&format=png&auto=webp&s=b62b4c6bc693163f80666fe395fad04949e0d324)\n\n[Classic Pattern](https://preview.redd.it/smfafsqdlk551.jpg?width=259&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ef70516e355140741b2c282ebd0a62e09cbc72f7)\n\nI currently believe we are entering wave 3 of the cycle, which is typically the strongest wave. It would not surprise me if we touched all time highs before wave 3 becomes wave 4. Although we continue to face risks of the virus and rising cases, people are starting to accept the new norm and have nowhere to put their cash. Money market fund AUMs are at all time highs, and people are going to get tired of earning .01% on their cash. Investing and trading is 'cool' again even outside of wallstreetbets, and this is the biggest dislocation the market has seen in 10 years - people want to get in and play. The Fed and the Government have actually come together, and likely saved us from a depression. There is a lot of pent up demand, and people are itching to get out and will take whatever precautions they feel will help. A lot of the data is coming in way better than people expected, and the brrrr brrrr will likely continue. \n\nTLDR; STONKS ONLY GO UP, BUY THE FUCKING DIP\n\nOptions Positions; XRX 10/17 25C, NOK 1/15/21 4C, XLK 1/21/22 100C, XLE 1/21/22 40C, VIX 7/22 52.5C", "created_utc": 1592445164.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hb5adh/elliot_wave_analysis_and_projections/", "is_self": true}
