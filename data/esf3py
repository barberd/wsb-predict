{"id": "esf3py", "title": "PSA: Comparison is the death of joy", "selftext": "There are a lot of people looking at some TSLA calls I sold yesterday and messaging me saying \"if only you had held them! You'd have made $700,000!\". I'm also getting messages from people new to stocks/options asking me how to improve their trading and results. These two types of messages go hand in hand. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me start with this PSA: Comparison is the death of joy. My wife first told me about that Mark Twain quote and I love it, especially how it applies to stocks. I cannot time travel. And if I could, I'd be a trillionaire.  You will ALWAYS have things in your life that you wish you had changed. But the past is written already. Every time you suffer a loss, whether in life or in stocks, make sure you learn a lesson from it and move on. The only way we can improve our lot in life is to think about your current situation (current positions, in this analogy) and decide how you will move forward, accordingly. That's it. You can't be born to different parents. You can't hold a stock you sold yesterday. You can't change the past. But you can change your future by stop focusing on regrets and start focusing on what is going to happen. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for coming to my TED Talk.", "created_utc": 1579713785, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/esf3py/psa_comparison_is_the_death_of_joy/", "is_self": true}
