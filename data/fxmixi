A sad excuse for a stimulus bill acts as a toothpick holding the economy up ready to fucking snap.  Paycheck to paycheck workers getting by on 1200 bucks are expected to hold up the entire UNITED STATES ECONOMY, people aren\u2019t paying their fucking rent, the big airlines are losing 80 million dollars a day, people are losing their sanity along with their money.  What does it mean when the streets in China are quiet, bereft of traffic all through the weekend MONTHS after they got the problem \u201cunder control,\u201d yet markets are up 25%?\n\nIt means the same thing as the sky turning green on a hot summer day in the midwest.  It means the same thing the as an ocean tide quickly ripping back into the distance.  It means the same thing as your little canary in the coal mine dying in its cage you as you hold it. \n\n*It means get the fuck out.*\n\nBut just in the distance you hear a feint \u201cbrr brrr brrrrrr BRRRRR\u201d.  People think thats what\u2019s pumping the markets.  It must be! IT HAS TO BE JEROME POWELL, ITS THE ONLY EXPLANATION!\n\nNo, not anymore.  People are aggressively buying the top.  They think its over.  They think they\u2019re clever.  NY cases are down, economy will boom! Right?\n\nPeople say don\u2019t try to time the market, it will always go up eventually; but as the days go on, I have come to adapt a similar, yet converse philosophy..\n\nDon\u2019t try to time the recession, we will go down.  Buy your puts, don\u2019t try to time the top.  Were about to make the great depression look a lot less great.\n\n220 5/15", "created_utc": 1586409850.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxmixi/dont_try_to_time_the_top_and_hop_the_fuck_on_the/", "is_self": true}
