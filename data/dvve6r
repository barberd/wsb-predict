{"id": "dvve6r", "title": "$GOOS semi-DD", "selftext": "So $GOOS crashed as low as 19% from their 'good' ER numbers due to details from their conference call. The negative details were that HK protests limited their growth in that city, and that they have better than expected revenue due to early shipments that would normally be in the next quarter. They reaffirmed guidance, and showed great numbers.... Does that equate to a $40M drop in market cap?\n\nNow a real DD request - GOOS is 99.4% institutionally owned, how weighted is Momentum as a factor in algo trading?\n\nI predict: GOOS will recover sharply from the low ($33.38). I am in on Dec 27 $35 calls and I doubled down buying shares at $33.85.", "created_utc": 1573667580, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dvve6r/goos_semidd/", "is_self": true}
