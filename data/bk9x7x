{"id": "bk9x7x", "title": "R1 RCM DD", "selftext": "R1 RCM announces earnings on 5/9.  Consensus estimate is ($0.05), and historically they have been missing.  But I'm betting that this is the year they break out.\n\nBackground\nR1 is a revenue cycle management company for hospitals.  The demand for these services is high and only going up.  The company got started in 2003, but had to enter an FTC settlement in 2013 (when it was known as Accretive Health).  Jan 2012, stock was $30; June 2012, it was $10; I entered Mar 2017 when it was $3.00 a share.  Since then it has climbed to $10 again.\n\nInstitutional ownership is going up this year.  Deutsche Bank, MetLife, and BOA have all increased their positions this year. https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/RCM/institutional-ownership/\n\nAnalysts are setting target prices around $13 or more.\n\nFinally, R1 is presenting at the BoA/Merrill Lynch Health Care Conference on May 15. I'm planning on all of this generating positive attention for them.  With the FTC problems settled, the acquisition a year ago, and the positive movement by institutional owners, I'm counting on a strong upside.\n https://www.apnews.com/Globe%20Newswire/4376b8f93c580c9d1fe49974d96699f2\n\nRight now I'm both holding the stock long and have 5/17 $10c.", "created_utc": 1556898205, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bk9x7x/r1_rcm_dd/", "is_self": true}
