Like, world record setting overpriced. People cannot afford to actually live in the condos they live in. They are financing them through banks, family, friends and employers. This is absolutely, in no way sustainable.\n\n2) Hong Kong's fight to remain independent from China will fail. \n\nBoth of these situations will cause this ETF to crash - hard. Puts should be on your radar.", "created_utc": 1562170391, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c8pza4/some_good_dd_on_ewh/", "is_self": true}
