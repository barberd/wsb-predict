In an effort to justify his mom's hard fought public school education that he got he attempted to use big nickel words and graphs to show Arizona and Florida are in a doomsday pact with their residents and they're all going to need to lockdown again, or everyone is going to die. As the title suggests I watched the press conference yesterday by Gov Destanis so you don't have to, and am here to give the corrected information about what's going on in the nations best run state. \n\nFirst, one thing to understand about Florida is due to the constant hurricane issues and the large old people population they have had the most detailed data and fastest reporting data in the nation. The governor does not get up on stage with a crap PowerPoint every day and have no actual color to add to everything, instead they have very granular data which cuts through the polical nonsense.  All data referenced in this post will be in the imgur link at the end. \n\nSecond all their elder care facilities are still on high alert and locked down. These have not reported and travel into and out of them are still very limited and carefully monitored.  All PPD is directed towards the elder care facilities, with hospitals getting the over run. \n\nOkay now onto the data. Yesterday Gov Destatis had a 1 hour+ press conference were he said where the state was at and where it was heading too. I doubt anyone from this sub watched it as it started about 10 minutes after apple decided to tank the market by announcing they were closing 8 stores. \n \nIn this press conference he first discussed why the number of infected was increasing. (Chart 1) he showed that all the new cases are from people who are under the age of 40. Which for 99.6% of all people will not result in death but at worse will be a bad flu. Further he went on to state that nation wide the only 2 people have died under the age of 30 who didn't have huge co-morbidities before they got Covid. Basically if you are healthy today and catch it you will be fine. \n\nHe breaks the new infection numbers down even further in chart 4 if you wanted to look at age split.\n\nHe backs his claim about younger people not being at risk with Chart 2 showing how the death rate is doing a nose dive. If they were actually at risk of death and were dying we would see it.  Additionally, he said they aren't going into hospitals either, as there are more available beds now in June than there were at any point between now and March 1st.\n\nSo this is a crap investment group so I should post on what this means for the market. Here's the brass tax, young people getting infected is a really good thing. The world has seen at least 6 major Covid related massive illnesses that they've attempted to develop a vaccine for. Do you want to know how many were successful? ZERO. There will not be a vaccine for covid-19 either as it mutates too fast. There is only one way out of this, herd immunity. The faster young heathy people get infected and become immune the faster we can attempt to go back to normal.  Any doctor on TV telling you anything else is lying to you. Also remember, our grandparents lived through a great depression 3 pandemics and 2 world wars and kept on trucking. We can make it through this.\n\nLong story short, invest in America buy quality long positions and enjoy the ride. Also fuck idiots telling you the world is going to end. \n\nFlorida data: Florida data https://imgur.com/a/JfoZM1o", "created_utc": 1592655214.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hclbrj/i_watch_the_press_conference_so_you_dont_have_to/", "is_self": true}
