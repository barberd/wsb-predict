{"id": "fvzhb7", "title": "AMZN price", "selftext": "From the very beginning of this crisis Amazon price dropped but then recovered very quickly almost to ATH and stays there still. It's questionable to me how is it possible? Their workers are on strike, prime deliveries all but delayed by 20 days or so(I tried ordering a cooking set that previously was delivered with usual 2 day shipping, now it's 20 days) excluding essentials. How will they not churn all prime customers? Video platform is not enough to be paying that much, and there is no benefit of having prime anymore because of delayed deliveries.  How is their price target not getting downgraded based on all this, am I missing something?\n\nI know jpow brrrr means people will still have money for something other than bread and milk, but still, spending is going to go down as folks are just going to be buying essentials, and when you're in need of toilet paper right here and now, would you wait for now unreliable Amazon delivery?", "created_utc": 1586182505.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fvzhb7/amzn_price/", "is_self": true}
