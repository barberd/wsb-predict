JPump is literally paying you to make this trade.\u00a0\n\nThe play is a NKLA put credit spread. You sell NKLA $20p expiring 1/15/21, and buy NKLA $15p 1/15/21.\n\nThat creates a SPREAD where you\u2019re getting paid about $800 for the $20 put, and paying about $400 to buy the $15p.\u00a0\n\nThat means you are guaranteed to make $400 as long as the stock stays above $20 by January. And you profit as long as the stock is above $16. If it does fall below that, your max loss is $100.\n\nThis is the easiest money you\u2019ll ever make. I\u2019ve personally sold 10+ of the $20 puts because of the insane money and my close friends have collectively sold another 20+. Sure NKLA is a pump and dump stock, but it IPOd around $20, no way it goes bankrupt by January, and in almost any scenario you\u2019re making thicc cash on this trade.\u00a0\n\nAdditional DD:\n\n\\* Fidelity and ValueAct (a top quartile returning hedge fund) and the PIPE was priced at $10 which means some analyst had to justify the numbers such that they could make at least a 50%+ gain from that price suggesting a floor price of $10-$15. This isn\u2019t going to be a quick flip from these guys, Fidelity is a boomer bagholder for life and straight from the ValueAct website: \u201cValueAct Spring is a highly engaged, long-term investor in pursuit of a healthy planet and the health of its inhabitants.\u201d\n\n\\* Their CEO is a born salesman and he\u2019s literally been a mormon missionary (Portugese/Spanish). You can trust this guy knows how to keep manufacturing positive news for the next year plus to keep this stock pumped\n\n\\* The implied volatility on NKLA is over 270%, that\u2019s a crazy number. The implied volatility on Virgin Galactic is only 110%, DraftKings is 100% and Beyond Meat is 80%. The value of these options will fall significantly as NKLA\u2019s implied volatility goes down creating an opportunity to lock in 50%+ gains early for the weak hands\n\n\\* NKLA has 12,000 pre-orders for their semi with pretty much no brand while Telsa has only 2,000 pre-orders on their semi with a huge brand name\n\n\\* Warrants are going to exercise/new shares are going to get dumped on the market, etc. etc. but this is priced into the options market, there\u2019s a reason these puts are too expensive to make a profit buying them. TIME TO SELL THEM.\n\n\\* This trade is literally just 7 months away, but implied volatility should fall to Virgin Galactic/Draftking levels within 2 months which enables the weak hands to walk away with a quick profit\n\n\\* Jeff Ubben (CEO of ValueAct) says it\u2019s a $100B company, Andrew Left @ citron research (big time gay bear) says this stock is worth \\~$40, and some \u201cequity research analyst\u201d covering Tesla says this stock is only worth $15, all good prices for this trade\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPosition:\n\nWrite NKLA Jan 15th $20 Put for \\~$8\n\nBuy NKLA Jan 15th $15 Put for \\~$4", "created_utc": 1592480225.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hbcyiz/yolo_opportunity_nkla_jan_15th_2015_put_spread/", "is_self": true}
