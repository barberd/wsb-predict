Record of decisions is being passed by EPA, and they corrupted as shit under trump. The last time NAK jumped from .40 cents to 3 dollars was on initial news of the mine being worth 100 billion dollars before any EIS or research was done, it then got shut down by obama's fda and dropped down to .40 cents. But now the research has been done and the road map is here. GET. IN. THIS. SHIT. Buy the shares and wait till mid year for triple your position. Don't buy the calls because it's too out of the money for what it's worth. Retards were speculating and it jumped to 3, but now there's actual facts, it will jump to at least 2 before mine production begins", "created_utc": 1581668173, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3p7si/dd_on_nak_literally_sitting_on_a_gold_mine/", "is_self": true}
