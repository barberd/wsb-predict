This article is huge, in terms for the market, just look at what had happened to Gilead Sciences when there was a rumor they had a treatment that worked. Ivermectin has a success that bears a 99.99% correlation between it working. Which means that it is reasonable to believe that this treatment will show results and is not just a simple placebo. This also isn't a rumor this is backed by real medical professionals and research institutes.\n\n**Some Key Takeaways**\n\nWith this new treatment we are looking at a decrease in hospital mortality of around 84%. This study was tested in 169 hospitals in 3 different countries. This treatment causes less required time in hospital care which could greatly free up ER\u2019s across the world and give more beds. Based on the recommended dosage of 150mcg/Kg the drug is reportedly safe.\n\n**Visuals**\n\n(P roughly means the calculated probability)\n\nVariable | NO IVERMECTIN | IVERMECTIN | P\n\n:--|:--:|:--:|--:\n\nNORTH AMERICA | 472 (67) | 451 (64.1) | 0.239\n\nSOUTH AMERICA| 34 (4.8)| 35 (5.0) | .902\n\nEUROPE | 107 (15.2)| 120 (17.0) | .346\n\nAFRICA | 30 (4.3)| 36 (5.1) | 0.450\n\nASIA | 60 (8.5) | 61 (8.7) | 0.924\n\nAUSTRALIA | 1 (0.1)| 1 (.1) | 1\n\nAGE (YEARS) | 53.4\u00b115.8 | 53.7\u00b117.0 | 0.732\n\nFEMALE | 310 (44) | 322 (45.7) | 0.521\n\nWHITE | 489 (69.5) | 484 (68.8)|  0.773\n\nBLACK | 26 (3.7) |  40 (5.7) | 0.078\n\nHISPANIC | 33 (4.7) | 37 (5.3) | 0.624\n\nASIAN | 148 (21.0) | 126 (17.9) | 0.139\n\nOTHER | 8 (1.1) | 17 (2.4) | 0.069\n\nCORONARY ARTERY DISEASE |  66 (9.4) | 91 (12.9) | 0.034\n\nDIABETES MELLITUS | 78 (11.1) | 82 (11.6) | 0.737\n\nCOPD OR ASTHMA | 15 (2.1) | 24 (3.4) | 0.144\n\nSMOKER (CURRENT OR REMOTE) | 131 (18.6) | 144 (20.5) | 0.383\n\nHISTORY OF HYPERTENSION | 167 (23.7) | 182 (25.9) | 0.355\n\nIMMUNOCOMPROMISED CONDITION | 14 (2.0) | 25 (3.6) | 0.074\n\nQSOFA | 1.4 \u00b1 0.7 | 1.5 \u00b10.8 | 0.259\n\nUSE OF MECHANICAL VENTILATION| 68 (9.7) | 22 (3.1) | < 0.001\n\nMORTALITY | 72 (10.2) | 13 (1.8) | < 0.001\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[Column Chart\\]([https://imgchest.com/p/wqb4zkmv4jm](https://imgchest.com/p/wqb4zkmv4jm))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why We Need a Treatment**\n\nThe vaccine for Corona virus is not near yet but even if it was the recent South Korean \\[South Korean study\\]([https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/17/836747242/in-south-korea-a-growing-number-of-covid-19-patients-test-positive-after-recover](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/17/836747242/in-south-korea-a-growing-number-of-covid-19-patients-test-positive-after-recover)) is proving that someone can get reinfected with Corona Virus. What that means is hypothetically someone vaccinated might stand a big risk of still getting Corona Virus. A vaccine might not be the cure all for this situation. So a treatment will be able to sway the number of cases and mortality down for the years to comes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*DISCLAIMER: This is all public knowledge and is able to found readily online and nothing in here is claiming to buy any sort of product*.\n\n\\[Link to Article\\]([https://pastebin.com/TaXHnjrj](https://pastebin.com/TaXHnjrj))\n\nTLDR; Ivermectin is going to be the biggest thing on the news for treating Corona.\n\nTLDR; for the TDLR; MRK $90c 05/22 or 5/29", "created_utc": 1587500217.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5mrm3/ivermectin_and_its_usefulness_in_covid19/", "is_self": true}
