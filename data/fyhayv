{"id": "fyhayv", "title": "Question for the Theta Gang", "selftext": "Theta Gang, come out and playyyyyyyyy.\n\nI sold weekly covered calls on BABA and they were exercised on Friday.  Have $25,000 in cash (can get more if needed by selling other shares) but am looking for recommendations on some shares to buy to in turn sell more weekly covered calls.\n\nI was looking at $TDG.  Would need to sell $9,000 more in other stock to buy 100 shares of TDG but I am long term bullish on this stock so wouldn't mind holding for the long term.\n\nI would rather not buy BABA again since I have losses and would rather not have a wash sale.\n\nTesla would be nice since the premium is so high, but I would have to sell a lot just to be able to own 100 shares.  So does anybody have some suggestions on what they would buy so they could sell covered calls on?", "created_utc": 1586530585.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fyhayv/question_for_the_theta_gang/", "is_self": true}
