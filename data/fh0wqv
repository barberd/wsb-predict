{"id": "fh0wqv", "title": "Dollar General (DG) - 3/12/2020 Market Hours - Discount Retail Winner", "selftext": "Stock: **Dollar General (DG) - 162.88$**\n\nDirection: **Neutral**\n\n**Price Target:** **160$**\n\n**Type: Put Credit Spread, Iron Condor**\n\n**Fundamental:** Dollar General is a superior discount retailer with great cashflow and constantly improving store metrics. It also has a dividend payout of 0.77% annually. Dollar General has mostly survived the coronavirus macro pull and is currently looking to beat both top and bottom line in upcoming earnings. While the discount retail sector has fared pretty well in current macro conditions, I doubt it\u2019ll continue trending to ATH again.\n\n**Technical**: Priced above 20DMA, below 50, 200 day moving average. MACD shows bullish convergence. RSI shows around 50, coming down slightly. Options sentiments are bullish in volume and neutral open interest. Implied movement is 5.2% or about 8.30$ Short interest is at 1.46%, with 3.9 days to cover. Support at 152$, with all time high being 167.44$\n\n**Sentimental**: Dollar General\u2019s main competitor, Dollar Tree, just had a subpar quarter performance-wise. However, in the last years of earnings, DLTR and DG did not have similar performances in earnings due to DG\u2019s vastly superior store model and trade-war preparation. In addition, the coronavirus outbreak has largely left DG unscathed, while DLTR faced a similar selloff. However, given the current macro outlook, an Iron condor may be a good move, though much riskier. I expect DG to beat earnings and at least inline guidance. \n\n**The screenshots provide specific plays drawn out on Schwab, with the PUT CREDIT SPREAD being the preferred play. Please let me know if any specific information is better in Text.** \n\n**3/20**\n\n**Sell 150 Put**\n\n**Buy 145 Put**  \n\n\nSince I moved the challenge to Schwab, it's alot most technical. Apologize in advance and please let me know what to bring from the SS to Text.  \n\n\n[Schwab Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/uFdXGTy)", "created_utc": 1583947927.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fh0wqv/dollar_general_dg_3122020_market_hours_discount/", "is_self": true}
