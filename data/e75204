Its pretty fairly priced, and has a strong year and looking like it's gonna be able to reinvest its earnings to steal a march on AI. Thought about longing $AMD too but its super volatile and right now is close or at its ATH\n\nI've also listed $OKTA as one of my picks. I forgot why, idek what they do, just googled and they do cyber security or smtn? The CEO isn't a pedo and nothing comes up with the search \"Okta epstein\" so i'm probably good\n\nI've also been told $CTRIP is a good buy, its a chinese travel company. The stock has declined recently, but is expected to pick up and profit off the travel craze in China, or something like that. Also passes the \"Ctrip epstein\" test", "created_utc": 1575668588, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e75204/what_are_wsb_picks_to_long_in_2020/", "is_self": true}
