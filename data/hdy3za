Do your own research.\n\nIf you\u2019re retarded like me, you bought at the top and are looking for a way out. This DD will require a 3rd grade degree to connect all the dots.\n\n**The Power of Makeup**\n\nAlthough the market is currently under stress, cosmetic goods remain popular. The cost of consumer retail makeup is still low (e.g. $5 for mascara, etc). The general cost aided with the institutional desire for women to wear makeup, keeps the demand for makeup inelastic. Enabled by the opportunities of a recession, Coty can establish gains in retail cosmetics.\n\nCoty\u2019s consumer retail cosmetic businesses include: Kylie Cosmetics, CoverGirl, and Rimmel London. Please note that Kylie Cosmetics pricing is at a premium compared to the more modestly priced CoverGirl and Rimmel products.\n\n**Introducing Kim Kardashian**\n\nJune has brought more fizzle than pop in the stock market. This has been a welcome surprise to some and complete dread to others. It is abundantly clear the market has slowed down. The impact of this slow has seen money move away from the retail stocks that flourished from their dramatic rise in April and May.\n\nAs retail stocks slowly pull away, we are still seeing positive trends elsewhere. Stocks that can generate momentum are being featured in the news constantly. One that sticks out at this moment is SPOT. After announcing the Kim Kardashian deal last Friday (6/18) the share price rose 4%. Even though Kim is the one everybody loves to hate, even she can generate hype in the media. Through Kim\u2019s recent traction in the media, Coty\u2019s stock is positioned to rise as well.

This was promptly after Coty\u2019s buyout in 1992; sales were estimated at $280 million at the time. Coty has only grown since then under Peter\u2019s direction as Chairman from 2001 to today and he has returned to lead the helm through the recession. (https://finance.yahoo.com/news/peter-harf-takes-helm-coty-120138837.html)\n\n\\- KKR purchased 60% of Coty\u2019s retail and professional hair care business for $1 billion direct and $2.5 billion in net cash proceeds. Nobody can deny that liquidity is king for any company right now and Coty was quick to capitalize. These new assets will create enough runway into 2021. (https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200601005387/en/Coty-Announces-Strategic-Transformation-Definitive-Agreement-KKR)\n\n\\- Rumors are circulating around possible KKW Beauty buyout. Seed Beauty (currently partnered with KKWB) is suing KKWB as they feel threatened by Coty\u2019s buyout potential. Seed Beauty was also partnered with Kylie Cosmetics before they were bought out by Coty in 2019. (https://www.tmz.com/2020/06/19/kim-kardashian-west-beauty-sued-kkw-trade-secrets-seed-beauty-coty-kylie-cosmetics-espionage/)\n\n\\- Kylie Cosmetics announces partnership with sister Kendall. The partnership will feature an entire line of products centered around Kendall. The promotion for this partnership was announced yesterday (6/21) and garnered #15 trending on YouTube. (https://www.allure.com/story/kendall-jenner-kylie-cosmetics-collection-collaboration-new-products)\n\n**Connecting Dots**\n\nI hate the Kardashians. Who doesn\u2019t? But it\u2019s time to put your edge-lord fedora away and understand that they are a brand name which can generate hype. Turn your Kardashian hate into an opportunity to make money off their marketing carpet bomb. They will keep rolling out the news hype into announcing a deal between KKWB and Coty over the next month.\n\nMakeup is still considered a mandatory item for females and still has opportunity for sales during a recession. With a new line of makeup from Kylie x Kendall and a heavily implied partnership with KKW Beauty on the back of Kim\u2019s Spotify deal, Coty is cheap DD.\n\nBing, Bang, BOOM! Let\u2019s make some money.\n\n**TLDR;** With sentiment growing towards news/hype based movement in the stock market. The Kardashians are creating a domino effect of media and hype which works. BUY THE DIP RETARD!\n\nCOTY 6C 7/17", "created_utc": 1592851368.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hdy3za/coty_dd_if_youre_gonna_hold_your_wifes_bag_you/", "is_self": true}
