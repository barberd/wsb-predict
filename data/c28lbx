{"id": "c28lbx", "title": "If JP Doesn't Sing Like A Bird", "selftext": "Then it's obvious he's messing with markets on purpose. He knows what to say, what people expect him to say, anything else and market will crash like Oct-Dec2018. He has to remove any language that puts rate cuts too far in the future. He needs to have immediacy to his words so we know without a shadow of a doubt that cuts are coming in July (if not tomorrow). \n\nPersonally, I think he'll sing the sweetest song and send markets higher. If he doesn't then I lose all faith in him and can't wait to see him go. And it's not because he will crash markets, it's because it'll become abundantly clear that he doesn't know what he's doing.\n\nSo what are your thoughts? Is he going to sing? How will markets look in the morning and then later after the meeting and press conference.", "created_utc": 1560895496, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c28lbx/if_jp_doesnt_sing_like_a_bird/", "is_self": true}
