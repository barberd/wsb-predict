Is there a way to short it or it's suppliers? I was just talking to my buddy about a Black Friday deal and the guy tells me the LG OLEDs work better for blacks. That's some blatant racism right there. I thought FB allowing targeted ads was bad. This is some next level shit right here programming TVs to work better for one race and not others. I googled this shit and it's all over the internet forums. It's a matter of time before Donald Trump gets offended and tariffs the shit out of these racist clowns.", "created_utc": 1574907557, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e2r3oy/best_way_to_short_lg_electronics_major/", "is_self": true}
