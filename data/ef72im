Look how much this shit is being bought up. \n\nIn order for it to reach these new highs, major indexes can\u2019t dip before then \u2014 and they won\u2019t. Market pump won\u2019t end until repo ops conclude, and it\u2019s already been reported that the Fed is considering ongoing repo injections as it remains \u201cdata dependent.\u201d (That is, buy up dips before prices fall below algorithmic sell levels to stabilize volatility.)\n\nIs the Fed going to cease repo ops? Is it going to begin raising interest rates anytime soon? Answer should be obvious. \n\nIWM is roughly half the price of SPY so it\u2019s cheap and easy money if Q1 2020 is anything like Q4 2019.", "created_utc": 1577221414, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ef72im/russell_2000_being_bought_up_to_aths/", "is_self": true}
