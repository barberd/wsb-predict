{"id": "g7q9ek", "title": "New Beginnings", "selftext": "There is one positive I thought I would like to share from this whole ordeal. We\u2019ve had a cancer growing in the last few decades on Wall Street with money in passive investment funds now overtaking money trusted in \u201cactive\u201d HFs late in 2019. \n\nThis rant could be long, but to keep it short because none of us degenerates like to read, what a fucking scam to give your money to some CFA holding, Macy\u2019s clearance suit wearing putz who holds your money in an S&P ETF in exchange for 2%. Isn\u2019t it a flaw of capitalism to be investing in just overall \u201cgrowth\u201d rather than the companies you believe will be competitive or vice versa are bloated and under-productive? Why would any company ever act with diligence ever again knowing the government will end up bailing them out because there\u2019s 4.5 fucking trillion of investors\u2019 money in these passive funds creating an inefficient cesspool?\n\nWith heavy redemptions already starting, and I believe will continue to rise, this could be the start to a much more efficient market of (real) growth with (real) investors. Curious to hear all the autistic opinions you have on this.", "created_utc": 1587803918.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7q9ek/new_beginnings/", "is_self": true}
