What you have to do is first verify your bank account and all that good stuff on Robinhood. RH then lets you transfer funds (I think up to like $50k) and have immediate access to them. Here\u2019s the catch though; if your bank account has zero funds, in it (I suggest transferring what you do have to another account), the transfer won\u2019t be verified for up to 3 days, but you still have the funds to trade with. Take the $50k and YOLO it on an OTM option that you don\u2019t plan to hold for more than 3 days. Then, when the option goes to the moon, you sell the option and keep the money. Robinhood then hits you with a $9 reversal fee for not having the funds available and bans you from getting \u201cinstant access to deposits.\u201d But you still get to keep the tendies. If the option goes tits up though, just delete the app and all you have to pay is the $25 overdraft fee from your bank.
