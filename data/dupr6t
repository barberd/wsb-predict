{"id": "dupr6t", "title": "INSANE DISNEY DD (MUST SEE)", "selftext": "I was watching these new Disney trailers, specifically, this one that came out 4 days ago called \"Soul\". Now at exactly 0:20 seconds into the trailer, a scene pops up of a stockbroker analyzing charts and if you look closely you can tell, the stock is going into a downward trend. Not only that, but the second this scene comes on, the narrator says, \"don't waste your time on all the junk of life\". STATING THAT DISNEY STOCK IS FUCKING JUNK, FUCK THE MOUSE. This trailer was produced by Pixar, which is owned by Disney, which is obviously DD that Disney is gonna be headed towards a downward trend when this film comes out. \n\nLond Dated Puts On Disney is the play here, fucking trust me, here's the trailer if you don't believe me watcht the trailer yourself,\n\nalso if you turn on captions, its the hedge fund manager himself who realises fuck Disney.\n\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TojlZYqPUo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TojlZYqPUo) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(mods if you delete your gay and your sister is gonna marry u/ControlTheNarrative", "created_utc": 1573462412, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dupr6t/insane_disney_dd_must_see/", "is_self": true}
