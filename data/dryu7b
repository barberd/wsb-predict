{"id": "dryu7b", "title": "Is Uber WeWork Rebranded?", "selftext": "Uber and WeWork has a lot of similarities. \n\n-They were both initially backed by Softbank that gave them sky high valuations before IPO (120bil at one point I believe).\n\n- they never made an actual profit and instead lost billions or so much money to the extent that losing hundreds of millions in a single quarter is considered \"good news.\"\n\n- A disgusting and immature corporate culture in which the CEO (now former) is a complete nutjob that had too much control of the company. Even now it is unclear if culture changed all that much based on how the employees act. ( search up employee behavior at IPO )\n\n- having negative operating cash flow in the hundreds of millions every quarter and relying on issuing billions of debt to stay afloat\n\n- justifying their existence and high valuations by pursuing a growth model that is most likely unsustainable because there can only be so many uber drivers. \n\n- didn't actually create a revolutionary product, instead what they are is essentially an app that lets strangers ferry you across town for half the price of a cab.", "created_utc": 1572958952, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dryu7b/is_uber_wework_rebranded/", "is_self": true}
