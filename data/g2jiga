So let me hit you with the next winning play -- FB 165p May 8th or later. IV on these babies is <60% and this is AFTER they report earnings on May 1st. Facebook is flying under the radar as a pseudo-tech stock but their #1 revenue is ads from small business, so their revenue AND guidance should be abysmal. Combine this with \"the next leg down\" and we have a very juicy gainz potential! Or go trade AMZN or TSLA with their 200% IVs I don't fucking care.", "created_utc": 1587058495.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2jiga/next_trade_idea_short_facebook/", "is_self": true}
