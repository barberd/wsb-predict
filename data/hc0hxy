{"id": "hc0hxy", "title": "PG&E (PCG) Bankruptcy Analysis - Risks and Rewards", "selftext": "In light of all the posts saying \"PG&E's bankruptcy is the next big trade, buy calls now\", I wanted to throw a dose of reality and analysis everyone's way so you understand why the share has been trading sideways, and what the range of outcomes can be from PG&E's bankruptcy.\n\nIf there is nothing else you take away from this, know this: **It is not a guarantee that PG&E moonshots or rockets up when it finally emerges from bankruptcy.**\n\n**SIDEWAYS - WHY??**\n\nThere have been a lot of people wondering why in the world the stock is trading sideways. If you look at historicals, this stock has been \"trading sideways\" for months now - it's actually been a pretty good hedge against current market volatility. This is not due to 'market manipulation' (well, maybe some) but rather because there is uncertainty around what the common stock offering (PCG) price will be when PG&E exits bankruptcy. Their public-facing bankruptcy documents give a number of $10.50/share and say it could be above or below this number. The market has consistently traded slightly higher than this number, in the absence of a second market crash, in the belief that it *is slightly more likely to be* higher than $10.50/share, but it could also not be. That is wholly dependent on the stock offering's underwriters. Accordingly the stock has been well shunted into a stock price that consistently holds around $11.\n\n**RISKS:**\n\n**tl;dr** \\- the common stock offering post bankruptcy could be below $10.50/share which will decrease share value; some of its creditors want their money and it may not exit bankruptcy by June 30; institutional investors will not inflate the stocks price before they get their private stock offering.\n\nYou can find a copy of PG&E's (ticker: PCG) most recent SEC filing concerning their bankruptcy here:  [https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/75488/000095015720000709/form8k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/75488/000095015720000709/form8k.htm)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. SHARE DILUTION\n\nPCG's current market capitalization is $5.87B. As part of bankruptcy, it is offering both a public common stock offering in the amount of at least $2.5B and up to $5.75B and a private offering of common stock in the amount of $3.25B.\n\nTherefore, at a minimum, after the bankruptcy there will be double the common stock (PCG) shares on the market, which will have a dilutory effect compared to prices pre-bankruptcy.\n\nThe report above states, for the private offering, the price will be \"a price per share that will be equal to (a) if the Public Equity Offering Price (as defined below) is greater than $10.5263, the lesser of (i) 95% of the Public Equity Offering Price and (ii) $10.50 and (b) if the Public Equity Offering Price is equal to or less than $10.5263, the lesser of (i) the Public Equity Offering Price and (ii) $10.00. \"\n\nTranslation: The public offering could be above $10.50/share, but it could also be below $10.50/share. If it is below $10.50/share, the stock will tank. It is a 50/50 shot that either outcome occurs.\n\nIf the public offering is below the PCG market price (hovers around $11) when bankruptcy exit is announced, expect the stock to go down. It could go down significantly. Not only would the additional stock dilute the current stock, but it would be sold at a lower price than current market value.\n\n2. DOES NOT EXIT BANKRUPTCY BY JUNE 30\n\nJudge Montali oversees PG&E's bankruptcy proceedings. You can see Judge Montali's calendar here:  [https://www.canb.uscourts.gov/judge/montali/calendar](https://www.canb.uscourts.gov/judge/montali/calendar) , and can even join some of the hearings.\n\nIt is not a guarantee that PG&E exits bankruptcy before June 30. If it exits before June 30, it will be able to join California's new Wildlife Insurance Fund that will give it protection in the event of future wildfires - hence it is pushing the June 30 timetable, and current indications imply that this will occur.\n\nHOWEVER, and this is a big however, not all of PG&E's creditors want PG&E to exit bankruptcy. Last week, one of them filed a motion to convert their Chapter 11 bankruptcy to Chapter 7 and basically liquidate the company. Obviously this motion was denied, but it makes it obvious that not everyone that PG&E owes money to is completely on board with this timetable.\n\nIt is possible, if unlikely, that a creditor or multiple creditors could try to pull legal maneuvers to keep the company in bankruptcy past June 30.\n\nIf this occurs, then the stock will go down.\n\nAlso, the hearing today is only to discuss the form of the final bankruptcy order, not confirm the bankruptcy plan. So while it is possible that the stock moves up, depending on what is discussed, it will not be the same as confirming the bankruptcy and announcing all the details - the latter \"details\" being very important for the stock to move up or down.\n\n3. INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS WILL NOT BUY IN\n\nInstitutional investors are guaranteed $3.25B of common stock (PCG) at a price of, at most, $10.50/share. They are not going to buy anything higher than $10.50/share, so if the market price is currently above $10.50/share, they will not do anything.\n\nTherefore, the only market action that will move the stock would be retail traders. We have seen a lot of stories about retail traders on Robinhood inflating junk stocks. However, those stocks were cheap, under $5. This company closed at $10.80/share yesterday. Don't expect the same type of retail bounce you see with stocks like HTZ.\n\nSome people falsely point to the stock \"rocketing to $13\" on \"faint news of a bankruptcy exit\" sometime earlier this month. That is a false connection - PCG went up to \\~$13 while the rest of the market was rocketing up earlier this month, not because of a bankruptcy exit. It proceeded to go back down to its stable $11/share pricepoint when the rest of the market declined, and has not left that point since the market started recovering its losses (which, if you look back since the March crash, this stock either shoots up with the market, or hovers at $11 - which made it a good post-crisis portfolio risk hedge).\n\n**REWARDS**\n\n**tl;dr** \\- the common stock offering could be above $10.50/share, probably up to $12/$13 per share; the stock is probably good to hold in a long-term portfolio.\n\n1. SHARE VALUE INCREASES\n\nThere is a 50/50 shot that the public common stock offering is priced above $10.50/share. If it is priced higher than the current market price, then the stock will go up to the stock offering price that will be offered in the public common stock offering. This price would be announced as part of the bankruptcy exit plan, near the end of the process.\n\nIt is unlikely that this would be higher than $12/13 per share, so plan accordingly. Calls are presently priced low, and it is probable that bankruptcy will end by June 30, so if you bought calls dated after that date, maybe you could turn a profit. It may be a wise idea to hedge your calls in case the stock offering price is below $10.50/share.\n\n2. LONG-TERM VALUE: GOOD STOCK BUY\n\nAt its current price, PCG is probably a good long-term hold if you wanted to buy some stock. Even if the public common stock offering was below $10.50, it won't be very far below $10.50 and you'd recoup the difference in at most a few months. Barclays and Bank of America, among others, say the stock's value is probably around $13-$15. Long-term, this stock could go to $20 or $30 per share (though it will never be at $70 again, unless the company actually performed better than history, because of the share dilution).\n\nIf the company exits bankruptcy by June 30, it will be part of a wildlife insurance plan in California that will protect it against future wildfire risk, which is a big, significant plus for holding the company long-term.\n\nPositions: 100 shares PCG long (@$10.84, lim @ $11, S/L @ $10.80)", "created_utc": 1592572529.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hc0hxy/pge_pcg_bankruptcy_analysis_risks_and_rewards/", "is_self": true}
