{"id": "g4y84r", "title": "Don\u2019t buy USO (DD inside)", "selftext": "Buying these oil etf's is very risky and largely misunderstood. Even with record inflows approaching $1.8 Billion dollars at the end of March, A savvy investor (or autist) should spend their money elsewhere. USO is designed for short term investors who constantly monitor sweet crude to swing trade. The fund holds short-term futures on WTI crude (NYMEX).\n\nRight now the fund is experiencing contango because the current oil futures are priced lower than future months, meaning profits are eaten away for long term investors. As West Texas Intermediate crude futures fall 50% and oil volatility explodes more than 200%, I strongly recommend to anyone looking for a good place to park money for the long term to avoid USO.\n\nIf you happen to be a trader with a substantial physical oil repository, you could place spreads betting on contago increasing and generate a healthy return. An individual controlling physical oil with storage can sell futures contracts for delivery at say $65, and then sit on the physical oil for a couple month to realize healthy gains.\n\nAlternatively, you could short a closer spot month's contract and buy a further out months securing profit if the market increases its contago structure (praying there isn't any backwardation). Unfortunately for this hypothetical individual, oil and other commodities are subject to this because short-term supply scares tend to drive UP the spot month price. With the fights between the Middle East and Russia heating up combined with existing political instability, personally I'd avoid the subject in its entirety.\n\nYou can very easily lose money even if oil goes past $40. Usually the roll premium for oil futures (what these etf's need to use) is around 20 cents, however it is near 6 dollars right now. If this continues even for a few months and you get into oil at $10 per barrel, you can easily end up losing money even when the price inevitably rises up again.\n\n\nSources are in comments because automod removes my post if I put links in the body\n\n\n\nTLDR: USO is fucked right now, stay away", "created_utc": 1587406942.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g4y84r/dont_buy_uso_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
