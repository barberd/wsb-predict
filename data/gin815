{"id": "gin815", "title": "Oil: OI for May futures leading into expiry vs. June futures so far?", "selftext": "It seems evident that the oil storage issue hasn't been alleviated at all, and June futures contracts expire in a week and still currently in contango, albeit slightly vs. before. Now certainly some investors like USO wised up and got out of June futures already, but gamblers are gamblers and oil's been going back up. So it's hard to tell if the same negative price action will happen.\n\nIMO the answer lies in open interest. If there's not really anyone who'll be holding a bag of shit come the 19th, then prices may still drop some but not to negative.

I can't find the volume further back than that or anything for May futures leading up to its crash other than  [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/CLK20](https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/CLK20) showing 13,044 OI at the end. Anyone have any idea where to get that data?\n\nNo idea even if futures do go negative what effect it'll have this time since a lot of things it affected last time recovered fine other than some reverse splits. But maybe the plays are long SCO (which peaked around 60 last time) or tankers? (NAT had its peak a week after the May expiry for instance - EURN and some others may be better plays since NAT might still be bloated from that previous hype)\n\nIt would seem absolutely retarded to paper trade futures in the days leading to expiry after what happened last time, but the world is filled with retards so who knows.", "created_utc": 1589326703.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gin815/oil_oi_for_may_futures_leading_into_expiry_vs/", "is_self": true}
