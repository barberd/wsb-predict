Splunk sports a very high, but not astronomical PE, with decent profitability and a consistent record of beating earnings guidance. The recent acquisition (6 month) of SignalFx gives them further footprint in the booming cloud computing sector. An additional note is an announcement of a DoD contract with some huge numbers on it. While I cannot explain its actual effects, I do believe this is a positive for Splunk. \n\n**Technical**: Priced below 20, 50 day averages and below 200 day moving average. MACD shows bullish convergence. RSI shows around 48, coming up from oversold. Options sentiments are very bullish in volume and bullish open interest. Implied movement is 9.1% or about 13.85$ Short interest is at 4.6%, with 5.6 days to cover. One thing to note, the ATM straddle is actually getting cheaper, with a tiny IV contraction. While not a strong signal, I believe this is bullish for Splunk, as contracting IV is not a normality in current macro environments. The skew to call side reinforces this idea. \n\n**Sentimental**: Splunk has been beating and raising for more than 4 years. This track record of growth and performance weights positively. Analyst sentiments are bullish with a higher price target than SPLK\u2019s current price. Numerous partnerships with kings like AWS, CISCO, Accenture give Splunk a competitive moat. While not directly affected by the coronavirus, Splunk will need a massive win to command a big upward move. The main wildcard is the DoD deal updates, which can be a massive boost. Primary bear case is missing estimates and guiding lower. \n\n**Robinhood (3/4/2020) Less Fucky. Not using. Moving to Schwab this weekend.** \n\n**Put Credit Spread 3/13**\n\n**Buy 135 Put**\n\n**Sell 140 Put**\n\n**Everyone is into big data, cloud and becoming big brother without looking like big brother. Splunk is currently the leader in this sector and has minimal effects from current market fears.**", "created_utc": 1583349716.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fdi5ow/splunk_splk_342020_amc_splunk_for_everyone/", "is_self": true}
