Fuck no. **Eating a pile of shit does not make you an expert on shit.**\n\nI\u2019ve lived through the 2018 stonk drop. You know what that taught me? Absolutely fucking nothing. Stonks go down and stonks go up. I\u2019m no better for it and I don\u2019t claim to be. Nobody should. I didn\u2019t gain wisdom or predictive ability.\n\n**Anyone who claims to have unmatched wisdom** because they lived through a period of stonks going down **is a fucking snake oil salesman.** I don\u2019t trust arguments where the main premise is \u201cI have experience in this kind of market\u201d. That\u2019s bullshit and everyone knows it. Experience /=/ ability and predictive wisdom. Leave that to the TA wizards, banks, and financial institutions.\n\n**Historical graphs exist.** Witnessing a recession doesn\u2019t make you special. Anyone can review the graphs and data of past events, not just those who experienced it and watched stonks fluctuate.\n\nWe didn\u2019t enter the fucking dark ages; I\u2019m 99% sure all you autists here can press the 5Y button on Robinhood and go \u201chaha stonks go up, but sometimes down\u201d \u2013 It\u2019s not a forbidden magic awarded only to people of a certain time period and experience level. **It\u2019s written in stone for the rest of history to be analyzed by everyone.**\n\nIn five years some autistic 18 year old is going to do DD and use this recession\u2019s ~6 month graph as evidence to support his \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b puts again. That\u2019s not inherently wrong, and **none of us are any better for pulling out the Ethos card**, adjusting our glasses, tipping our fedora, and rapidly swinging our dick in a circle **as we claim, \u201cAckshually, I experienced this recession,** here\u2019s my crystal ball prediction (excuse the velocity of my penis)\u201d\n\nOh, and I love \u201c**I\u2019m a professional trader**\u201d\n\nWho the fuck put the golden star on the fridge and declared you a professional trader? Fuck, I can do that.\n\n*I hereby declare myself a professional trader.* \ud83c\udf1f\u2014 I\u2019m an expert now.\n\nSee how easy that was? Fuck off. You\u2019re not a hedge fund manager or a risk assessment analyst. We\u2019re barely better than gamblers. Worse, a lot of the times. \n\n**So shut the fuck up \u2014 You're no different for watching stonks go down.**\n\nRanting because I see this too much.\n\n**TL;DR: 5/1 $SPY 250p don't wait until expiry**", "created_utc": 1586414037.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxnctv/living_through_a_recession_doesnt_make_you_wiser/", "is_self": true}
