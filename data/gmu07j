The rate of gain is strangely consistent too.\nAnyhow, SHOP is majorly held by institutions. So don't buy puts. Prices can't go down if no one is selling. This might be a good short-term calls play if they're cooking the book. Pretty sure the next earning will be +~50% in revenue too.", "created_utc": 1589912221.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gmu07j/something_is_odd_about_shop_or_shopify/", "is_self": true}
