DIS Puts???", "selftext": "First time caller, long time autist. \n\nI came into some money at the start of summer and wanting to get some of that Trump pump action I kept hearing about, I put a piece of that money into the market. \n\nI bought and sold Blue Chips, and the account went up and down by a few bucks, never too much movement in either direction despite the legendary bull run. - Thats what I get for starting over at investing and stocks\n\nBeing a lifelong degenerate, I spent all summer on this sub reading about options and decided to finally get my feet wet last week. Bought some Uber puts and got a win. Took the profits and bought Disney calls, then fucked up and accidentally inversed some retard who posted about buying AVTR puts and both ended up taking profits today (I won\u2019t even get start on how retarded I am for selling my Dis 155 3/20 Calls at only 80% profit). Clearly options are the way to go though. \n\nNow, in a week my account grew 15% in just 3 moves. This means a 3/3 success rate -or 100% success - and 3 times making it a pattern according to FBI Serial Killer profiling procedures, this literally cannot go tits up. So the obvious move is deposit 10X the money into my account, buy 10x the options, and start picking out Lambo gloves. \n\nBut the rest of the internet outside of this sub says 15% annual ROI is like a fucking unicorn. Which I think means I need to wait till the new year to try again - and if I do get to 15% in 2020 again, I kinda hope it doesn\u2019t happen right in January or I\u2019ll have to wait an entire fucking year and I enjoy trading.\n\nSo what\u2019s happens now? Should I shut down my account or double down??\n\nP.S. Just bought some Uber dip to go with my tendies in case anyone questions my autism. \n\nP.S.S. Considering DIS 147 11/22 puts.
