HCA took a massive ding and is trading 21 bucks off its pre-earnings share price of (140 ish).  In addition to this I'm long the stock overall but want some adrenaline rushes from the options spikes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHCA does 5% of american healthcare and the primary reason for the decline in their stock was due to a buying spree of outpatient and ambulatory surgical centers.  Overall headlines are that revenue per facility grew, admissions per facility grew... every facility is doing better but on an overall basis the balance sheet looks bad because of massive amounts of new acquisitions in the early part of the year.  However, they are  long term investments into the overall direction of healthcare.  As socialists and radical dems start to force payers/government payers to reimburse at lower levels (aka value based reimbursement) its going to become increasingly important to control the patient pipeline.  By securing all aspects of the patient pipeline HCA is becoming a vertically integrated health system.  Furthermore, their recent expansion into North Carolina with a 1.5 Billion purchase of Mission health shows that they are looking towards aggressive expansion in the US as well as in England (they own several hospitals there including the one the recent royal baby was born in).  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a health admin myself working in the corporate office of a large health system (non-public, not for profit), when HCA comes to town everyone looks to sell out or to raise huge amounts of capital, its the equivalent of walmart rolling into your bumfuck town.  They are the largest player in this space, they have comical amounts of money to spend/buy out competitors and most importantly they have almost no brand.  Normally thats bad, but in this situation if an HCA hospital gets caught diddling kids and covering it up its not going to be \"HCA diddled kids and covered it up\" itll be \"local hospital diddles kids\".   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGo long on HCA, the recent share price decline is because of an over-reaction to their buying spree thats driven by non-healthcare folks having a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of this industry.  Its insanely expensive, but once you finish the purchase, your customers have no choice but to lube up and be price takers.  This is a dope industry.", "created_utc": 1566920785, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cw6947/hca_healthcare_discussion/", "is_self": true}
