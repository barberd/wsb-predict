I run a small business and am currently applying for relief aid under the CAREs Act.  The CAREs Act which got past a few weeks ago had a section which provided a $10k emergency relief grant to small business with less than 500 employees. Additionally, the paycheck protection program (PPP) appropriated a $10 million forgivable loan for qualifying business in order to ensure payroll was met. Sounds great on paper, market rallied and end of story, right? \n\nWrong. The Small Business Administration (SBA) has gotten virtually NONE of this money out.  Take a look at /r/smallbusiness and you can see just how bad the chaos is. Trump on Friday, during the press conference, said that \"$365 million\" had already been granted to small business. This is complete bull shit. The SBA's rough estimates say at most TEN(10) whole business have received money as of right now.  \n\nThe SBA has no idea what they're doing. After calling several different times I got several different answers regarding who qualifies, and when we could see the relief.  They're also \"reinterpreting\" Section 1110(e)(1) of the law which states that the money needs to be sent out in 3 days to  3 days of the loan officer receiving it - whatever that means. There is no timeline for when small business will get this aid.\n\nInvestors think small business will be fine, but they're wrong. If small business can't pay their employees we are utterly screwed. \n\nTl;dr: Bureaucracy is slow and the SBA isn't doing their job.
