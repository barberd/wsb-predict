{"id": "gav4se", "title": "The $ZM bear case is getting stronger.", "selftext": "First - $ZM is not a bad company.  It generates decent free cash flow, is sitting on $1bn in cash and has found their niche in a global pandemic.  That said, they are very, *very* fucking overvalued.  I'm not going to use a discounted cash flow model to derive a fair price, cause fuck all that.  Instead:\n\n1.  They committed the cardinal sin of misstating how many users were actually on their platform (see Verge article this morning).\n\n2.  Their platform is likely getting undercut by Microsoft and Google (Teams and Meet), particularly within their largest customers.  These customers have comprised a significant bump in revenue for Zoom, at least according to their last 10k.\n\n3.  These largest users most likely have an existing license with MSFT or GOOG, and my guess is they'll revert to using tools that provide continuity with an existing product line.  Zoom integration within Outlook (and similar products) is ok, but MSFT and GOOG will find ways to create a better user experience.\n\n4.  Monetizing the average Joe Blow is tough for ZM.  They are collecting *some* valuable info on their users, but in a narrow channel.  Definitely not enough to justify any normal method of valuation.  Then again, this market doesn't give a fuck about valuation, so take that with a grain of salt.\n\nAnyways, there you have it.  $ZM gonna drill soon, yadda yadda yadda.", "created_utc": 1588251288.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gav4se/the_zm_bear_case_is_getting_stronger/", "is_self": true}
