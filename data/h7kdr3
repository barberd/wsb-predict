An explaination of CACC's accounting methods courtesy of [Matthew Greenberg - @greenycapital over on Twitter](https://twitter.com/greenycapital/status/1271197048574967808):\n\n\"Over the next few weeks I\u2019ll be rolling out some threads on CACC as we approach the end of what could be a company altering quarter. This is the first of those threads, and it is going to be about \u201clevel-yield\u201d and \u201ceffective yield\u201d interest method accounting. Historically \u201clevel-yield\u201d and \u201ceffective yield\u201d amortization have been used primarily as ways of, in the most accurate way possible, reflecting interest earned on a bond purchased or sold at a discount to fair value. The system works like this:\n\nA purchaser (or seller) of a discount bond records a loans receivable (loan payable) amount on the balance sheet equal to the $ paid (received) for that bond. Over time, that bonds value is increased such that at maturity, the bond\u2019s book value equals its par value. This can be done through straight line amortization, but doing so does not take into account the compounding interest rate an investor earns/company pays by buying/selling that bond. Level-yield and effective yield accounting do by calculating a YTM for the bond and amortizing. By applying that YTM to the book value of the bond to calculate interest income/expense. As the BV  grows towards par value, the interest income/expense grows proportionally, thus more accurately representing the true yield the investor/seller receives/pays over the bonds life.\n\nCACC uses level/effective-yield in a different way. Pre-CECL, when CACC purchased a loan from a dealer they record a receivables balance equal to the advance paid for the loan and an \u201caccretable yield\u201d balance equal to the company\u2019s expected collections net of the advance. The amortization of that \u201caccretable yield\u201d was done by applying the level-yield to the loan\u2019s carrying value the same way it\u2019s done in a typical bond amortization. The problem? This practice does not accurately reflect the reality of CACC\u2019s business the way it does for others.\n\nCACC purchases a loan for their purchase program with $200 of contractual payments owed over 5 years for $100. They expect to collect $150 of that amount. They record a loan receivable balance of $100, and an accretable yield balance of $50 to be amortized over those 5 years. They assume $30 of payments in each year and calculate a \u201clevel-yield\u201d of 15.2% to maturity. In the first period, CACC will record accretion of $15.22 no matter how much they actually collect from the borrower. They then net out the remainder of the collections as principal. If there\u2019s a collection shortfall, CACC takes a provision equal to that amount (even if expected collections over the loan\u2019s life don\u2019t change), and adjusts the accretable yield to equal (AY at start of period 1 - accretion + provisions + net change in forecast). At that point, CACC recalculates their expected collections and adjusts the yield. If collections were in-line, and expectations are stable the rate will be the same. If forecasts were raised, they will raise the level-yield to account for this; if not THEY DONT CHANGE THE YIELD That\u2019s right, CACC uses the higher of the initial YTM and the calculated level yield. So let\u2019s just assume collections go exactly as expected. What happens? CACC recognizes accretion of $15.22 in Y1, $12.97 in Y2, $10.93 in Y3, $7.47 in Y4 and $3.41 in Y5. Meanwhile, they recognize principal of $14.78, $17.03, $19.07, $22.53, $26.59 respectively in each of those years. See the problem yet? CACC is collecting $30 in each period, but recognizing $.51/$1 of collections in year 1, and $.11/$1 in year 5. Meanwhile, their credit risk grows (cars depreciate in value, so the underlying value of the collateral is declining even as contractual payments stay stable). So, CACC recognizes 56% of a loan\u2019s accretable yield in years 1 and 2, but only 31% of the principal. It\u2019s a mismatch. That\u2019s fine if it was the other way around, but as is, CACC is recognizing revenue it has not earned yet. If collections come in lower than expected after those two years, they have to take a larger write-down on receivables because they overstated loan income in the first 2 yrs\n\nSo that brings us to today, where COVID is ravaging CACC\u2019s loan book. They are seeing collections come in below expectations, when they\u2019ve already taken more in loan income  than they will earn over the life of the loan. This leads to massive provisions for losses. Meanwhile, the loans that are performing as expected are effectively non-performing loans, with receivables on the BS earning substantially less in accretable yield/dollar collected. Add on top of that the impact of CECL, which makes new originations a NI negative in year one. And CACC is essentially in earnings hell. Usually, they grow their loan book to offset the fact that all loan vintages are now earning less/$ collected than they did the year before as a result of level-yield, but with CECL that growth will be NI negative. The company is going to do their best to keep non-CECL provisions as low as possible, but given the amount of accretion they\u2019ve pulled forward, it\u2019s going to be very hard to do that. How are lenders going to feel with revenue collapsing and provisions growing? Not good. Especially the lenders and senior secured bond holders, who are junior to the ABS holders in a liquidation event. The company had $25 mil of non-restricted cash on the BS at the end of Q1. I would not want to be a creditor watching earnings collapse even as collections stabilize.\n\nThat\u2019s it for this thread, will be back with more periodically as I see fit over the next few weeks. Feel free to reach out with questions, I know it\u2019s complicated and Twitter isn\u2019t the best platform for this, but it\u2019s the best option I\u2019ve got.\"\n\nTL:DR - Short / Put CACC to oblivion.", "created_utc": 1591967313.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h7kdr3/dd_on_the_fall_of_credit_acceptance_corp/", "is_self": true}
