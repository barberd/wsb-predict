As long as no one audits it carefully or asks hard questions on analyst calls, it will keep going up. It can be bigger than Luckin, and bigger than Enron, which is easy because most values greater than $0 qualify. The key is to just not be the final bagholder!\n\nNow, I know what you are all thinking - Jeff Skilling, convicted felon, etc etc etc. But this man is an innovator. Not only did he innovate and disrupt energy finance, he ALSO innovated in the field of accounting fraud. He caught lightning in a bottle twice. It's not luck. Just imagine what the third time will be. \n\nTLDR: When this IPOs, we will know we are at the peak for 20 years.\n\nPS: He got out of prison last year.  That's why it took so long. This business model has been in development for 12 years inside prison! I bet Martin will have a better business plan though when he gets out of prison.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1591233872.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gw7cmk/enron_20_whos_ready/", "is_self": true}
