I hope everyone on this subreddit made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 29th, 2019.\n\n# **The Fed is about to cut rates to protect the economy, even though most signs are strong  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/26/fed-to-cut-rates-for-first-time-since-2008-jobs-data-should-be-strong.htmll)**\n*****\n&gt; The Fed is expected to cut interest rates for the first time in more than a decade Wednesday, a pre-emptive move as concerns rise about the impact of the trade wars and a slowing global economy.\n*****\n&gt; Friday\u2019s July jobs report should show that the U.S. economy is still strong, with 170,000 nonfarm payrolls being added and an extremely low unemployment rate of 3.7%, according to Refinitiv. That follows this past Friday\u2019s report of second -quarter GDP, which grew at a better than expected 2.1% but showed clear signs of impact from tariffs and trade friction.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks gained in the past week, with the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq hitting new highs, as investors anticipated a Fed rate cut, and also a better-than-expected earnings season. Earnings growth is slightly positive so far this quarter, but that could improve with another big wave of earnings in the week ahead, when nearly a third of the S&amp;P 500 report.\n*****\n&gt; Apple, Exxon Mobil, Procter and Gamble, Merck, General Motors and Verizonare among companies reporting. Beyond Meat, the hot IPO with a market cap bigger than a quarter of companies in the S&amp;P 500, reports Monday. Seventy-five percent of companies have beaten estimates so far and 60% beat revenue expectations.\n*****\n&gt; It will be the Fed though that will likely have the most market impact, and strategists are looking for the central bank to signal it is open to future cuts but not necessarily promising them. Economists mostly expect anywhere from one to three rate cuts this year, but there is near consensus that this first cut will be a quarter percentage point.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market is pricing in a 25 basis point cut,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist with Prudential Financial. \u201cWe already know of two Fed presidents who don\u2019t think we need it, so there\u2019s obviously going to be a discussion, with the strong data. The chairman, who is in the camp that we need to have an insurance cut, is going to make the case that while the economic data are all gaining strength, they are still worried about weakening conditions, due to uncertainty regarding trade and tariffs.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The strains of the trade war and tariffs showed up in a reduction in gross private domestic investment in second quarter GDP of 5.5%, the worst decline in that category since 2015. Within that, exports fell 5.2%. The decline in business investment wiped a full percentage point from the final GDP number.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed has boxed itself into moving rates, says JP Morgan US chief eocnomist\n*****\n&gt; In the last several weeks, as the Fed meeting edged closer, economic data began to show signs of improvement from a soft patch this winter and spring. Consumers, who comprise 70% of the economy, strengthened in the second quarter, with consumption up 4.3%, its best reading since the fourth quarter of 2017.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed \u201cwill signal they\u2019re\u2019 going to go on if conditions warrant it. It\u2019s clear the chairman and his cohorts are not looking at incoming data in the sense that they are data dependent. They made it clear they want to inoculate the economy,\u201d Krosby said.\n*****\n&gt; Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpoint, said he expects the Fed to cut rates just once and then stop.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThey\u2019re not going to say that we\u2019re done. I think it would be too much of a leap for the market. My sense is they\u2019ll leave the door open, but their aim is not going to be locked in for the next meeting. It\u2019s clearly a function of how the data play out,\u201d Stanley said. \u201cI\u2019m just more optimistic than they are about the how things are going to evolve.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Investors will also be watching for headlines on trade in the coming week, as the U.S. delegation returns to China for the first round of face to face talks since May.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/qIIO6nE.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/RrxEssP.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/X3jETZh.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/ZPrkyNm.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ptHTv4U.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DCcXfwD.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lxlltRX.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jse4rUG.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for next week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SyyFomj.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/IGWYNX7.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/FFNwff2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/dKsX4FB.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/ZQ2dOjE.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/mn6JY5y.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 7/26/19\n\n&gt; The Chicago Fed's National Activity Index kicked off this week's busy macroeconomic data slate on a disappointing note with a still negative reading that was below forecasts. Weak data continued to come in on Tuesday with FHFA home price growth slowing to 0.1% and the Richmond Fed Manufacturing index reaching a multi-year low. Existing Home Sales also came in weaker. Preliminary Markit PMIs released on Wednesday came in below estimates and weaker than the previous month while the services portion saw the opposite results. The release of preliminary Durable Goods and Capital Goods on Thursday came in much stronger than both expectations and the May release. Meanwhile, weekly labor data once again came in at a multi-month low. We ended the week with stronger than expected GDP data, but it still showed the economy slowed versus the first quarter. Overall, economic data didn't have the greatest of weeks with over half of the indicators released weakening or coming in below estimates.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/072619-Eco1.png))**\n\n&gt; Next week is a busy one when it comes to macroeconomic developments. The week starts off quiet with only the Dallas Fed's Manufacturing Activity Index out on Monday. It is expected to rebound to -5 off its multiyear low of -12.1 from its June release. Things pick up on Tuesday with the release of personal income and spending data which are forecast to fall 0.1%. PCE data, Pending Home Sales, and consumer confidence will also be out that day. Ahead of Friday's Nonfarm Payrolls report, which is expected to show 170K added jobs in July, on Wednesday ADP will release their own employment data. Also on Wednesday, there will be an FOMC rate decision followed by a presser by Fed Chair Powell. Markets are anticipating a 25 bps cut in this meeting. After digesting the results of this meeting, on Thursday ISM will release their manufacturing report for July. In addition to the NFP report, the release of the June trade balance, factory orders, and the University of Michigan's sentiment data will all round out the week on Friday.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/072619-Eco2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Bespoke Report -- Global Macro Outlook\n\n&gt; This week we're outlining how we see the global economy at present, along with its influence on US interest rates, credit, commodities, and equity markets. One of the topics we discuss in detail is the strong performance of US GDP in Q2, which in addition to upward revisions from 2014-2018 also showed newly-reported Q2 growth that was far stronger than analyst estimates. Smaller-than-expected headwinds from trade and inventory and a massive surge in consumer spending helped push growth above expectations despite weak investment. With the Fed set to join the global central bank easing party at its July meeting, it's part of the reason to expect that the global backdrop is set to improve.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/072619-Bespoke-Report-Sample.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Closer: End of Week Charts -- 7/26/19\n\n&gt; Looking for deeper insight on global markets and economics?

This tells us the technicals may now be aligning with our optimistic fundamental outlook for financials, which we highlighted in our Midyear Outlook 2019.\n\n&gt; Financials\u2019 strong performance has continued a few weeks into July, with the S&amp;P 500 Financials Index and KBW Bank Index both outpacing the market thus far. Defensive areas of the market, including the utilities, real estate, and healthcare sectors, have all lagged the S&amp;P 500 since the end of the first quarter. We think cyclicals\u2019 outperformance could continue if economic fundamentals improve.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe rotation from defensive stocks, which have led for much of the past year, to more cyclical areas of the market, is not only healthy for the bull market, but should favor active managers who can overweight these sectors,\u201d according to LPL Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch.\n\n&gt; While we don\u2019t anticipate broad market performance to be as strong in the second half of 2019, we believe that an overweight to financial stocks may offer an opportunity for suitable investors based on attractive valuations, a potentially steeper yield curve, and an improving technical picture.\n\n*****\n\n# August: Better in Pre-Election Years, But Still Not Great\n\n&gt; Money flows from harvesting made August a great stock market month in the first half of the Twentieth Century. It was the best month from 1901 to 1951. In 1900, 37.5% of the population was farming. Now that less than 2% farm, August is amongst the worst months of the year. It is the worst DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 month over the last 31 years, 1988-2018 with average declines ranging from 0.1% by NASDAQ to 1.1% by DJIA.\n\n&gt; In pre-election years since 1950, Augusts\u2019 rankings improve modestly: #7 DJIA, #8 S&amp;P 500, #10 NASDAQ (since 1971), #9 Russell 1000 and #10 Russell 2000 (since 1979). Average performance in pre-election years is positive except for Russell 2000 which is unchanged.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b2c259751b53bc3c3005d4c266dd9fac/b4aa95c4256eed3a-ce/s400x600/345335a8152d24b9b10af91f813c9bf07af456fe.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Contributing to this poor performance since 1987; the shortest bear market in history (45 days) caused by turmoil in Russia, the Asian currency crisis and the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund debacle ending August 31, 1998 with the DJIA shedding 6.4% that day. DJIA dropped a record 1344.22 points for the month, off 15.1%\u2014which is the second worst monthly percentage DJIA loss since 1950. Saddam Hussein triggered a 10.0% slide in August 1990. The best DJIA gains occurred in 1982 (11.5%) and 1984 (9.8%) as bear markets ended. Sizeable losses in 2010, 2011 and 2013 of over 4% on DJIA have widened Augusts\u2019 average decline. A strong August in 2014 of S&amp;P 3.8% and NASDAQ 4.8% preceded corrections of 7.4% and 8.4% respectively from mid-September to mid-October.\n\n*****\n\n# Second-Half Pre-Election Year Blues Absent\u2026So Far\n\n&gt; A little over one week ago, we posted updated charts of historical pre-election year performance with 2019 overlaid for comparison. Like then DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ are still comfortably above average for this time of a pre-election year when compared to historical data. Thus far earnings have supported a continuation of the rally. A 100% probability (according to CME Group\u2019s FedWatch Tool as of today) that the Fed will cut rates at least 0.25% is also aiding. And now it appears the debt ceiling is going to be raised eliminating another market headwind. \n\nIt would seem the market has nearly everything going its way. Almost, sentiment is running on the frothy side. According to Investors Intelligence, bullish advisors have reached 58%, a new high for 2019, while bearish advisors are down to just 16.8%. Historically these levels have been an early warning. Combined with the historically meager gains in the second half of pre-election years (visible in the charts below), the rally appears to be increasingly prone to faltering. If the market does take a pause and consolidate some of its gains so far this year in August/September/early-October, it would likely improve the possibility of a respectable fourth quarter rally.\n\n&gt;
