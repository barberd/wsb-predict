In general, buy options on indices rather than ETFs if there is one available.\n\nWhy? [IRS Code Section 1256](https://traderstatus.com/traders/mark-to-market/commodities-trading/), of course.\n\nOh, you forgot about IRS Code Section 1256? For index stocks (including options): \"all gains or losses are subject to the 60/40 rule, which states that 60% of gains/losses are long-term and 40% are short-term \u2013 no matter how long the securities are held.\"\n\nDepending on your tax bracket, roughly 10-15% more profits hit your pocket. This applies to VIX and VXX trades as well. So sell whatever position you have in SPY and buy the equivalent in SPX - any profits from here on out will have this tax advantage.", "created_utc": 1584771013.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmaiyh/spx_spy_free_money_on_gains/", "is_self": true}
