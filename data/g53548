Feel free to ban me immediately if this post isn't autistic enough.\n\nI'm also not an infectious disease specialist, but I do have a PhD in Biomedical Sciences. \n\nI came across the following report: https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/doi/10.1182/blood.2020006288/454437/The-BTK-inhibitor-ibrutinib-may-protect-against\n\nIt coincides with anecdotal evidence that patients with CLL who take a BTK inhibitor have less severe symptoms after testing positive for COVID-19:\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2020/04/13/exclusive-astrazenecas-calquence-shows-early-promise-for-covid-19-patients/#7e740264677c\n\nThe two drugs in question are ibrutinib (sold as Imbruvica by Abbvie) and acalabrutinib (sold as Calquence by Astrazeneca). What I like about these two agents is that they seem to lessen the severity of symptoms by blocking the cytokine storm. What I don't like is that they reduce the function of B-cells, which make the antibodies that help fight off SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, I think that keeping patients off ventilators should be priority #1, and these drugs seem to do it better than anything else. Tocilizumab (atlizumab, an anti-IL6 antibody by Roche (RHHBY)) may be another good option but I'll await more clinical data before making a call.\n\nAs I said, I don't trade options, but if I did:\nABBV 100c  6/19\nAZN 57.50c 7/17", "created_utc": 1587422708.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g53548/btk_inhibitors_may_protect_against_pulmonary/", "is_self": true}
