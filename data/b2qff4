Basically the trade was profitable if NVAX landed anywhere between $1-$4, with NVAX at 2.5.\n\nWell now NVAX is at .5 but the in-the-money side of the straddle I wrote wasn't exercised, so instead of loosing thousands of dollars, I made thousands of dollars.\n\nHave no idea what happened. It's never happened to me before. My takeaway is to write more NVAX straddles in the future.", "created_utc": 1552955329, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b2qff4/wrote_deepinthemoney_nvax_options_and_they_didnt/", "is_self": true}
