For the $5 call the IV says 102.57% and for the $4 Call the IV reads 87.14%. Originally I invented on holding until right before ER on 09/03 and then dumping. Now I've read that the ER is actually 09/12 (RH fucked me?). As of market close I am in the green by a bit. Anyways, I'm obviously new, and I'm worried about IV crush and other factors I'm ignorant on.
