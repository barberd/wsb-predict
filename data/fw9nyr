Yeah they had some accounting misstatements but besides that this company is still excellent. The Chinese population is backing this company because they know its value and how good the product is. As it was reported today the Luckin Coffee app had a huge surge in downloads, well over 300k. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4779mck58ar41.png?width=655&format=png&auto=webp&s=337861d31870d63382c4d3877ab3ba4674036782\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wrmzk7wa8ar41.png?width=533&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f7e1d5132d31e8c1953fd71090f05eeefb9f66d\n\nThe Chinese people love this shit and the company will still have great sales.. am I saying that the stock deserves to be at its ATH like before? Hell no, not right no but it definitely has more value than $4.50 a share. The next earnings report will absolutely prove this. \n\n**Delisting:**\n\nThere has been talk about it's stock being delisted but that is such a long shot I believe they won't be delisted and will just receive a slap in the wrist. \n\nI'm absolutely fishing for the bottom and entered into a position today by buying stocks and calls.\n\n9/18 $5c\n\n5/1 $4c", "created_utc": 1586216405.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fw9nyr/luckin_coffee/", "is_self": true}
