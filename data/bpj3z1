I know with FDs it's just gambling but I had the itch of being able to trade the same option many times a day so I deposited more money to finally be over $25k on my robinhood account. A lot of people have the idea that being able to skip PDT restrictions and day trade as much as you want is easy mode and quick easy profits which of course is not the case but I still had the itch to try it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried it today with spy 05/17 $189 call when the trend was up and then sideways and made around $300, then the slip at the EOD and of course I lost like $900 (net loss $600).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm thinking maybe trying calendar to reduce risk spreads but I doubt they'll get actually filled most of the time while on FDs there's a lot of volume and open interest and they are filled immediately. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyone here makes consistent profit day trading? (it could be like 1 hour to make net gain $50 bucks or something like that).
