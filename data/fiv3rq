{"id": "fiv3rq", "title": "Trading Floors Planning to Close Very Soon - See CBOE New Rule Filing on March 13 (Source)", "selftext": "The trading floors are planning to close and go screen-based. Overview of the new rule for the Cboe Exchange:\n\n\"Rules of Cboe Exchange, Inc. Rule 5.24. Disaster Recovery (a) \u2013 (d) No change. (e) Loss of Trading Floor. If the Exchange trading floor becomes inoperable, the Exchange will continue to operate in a screen-based only environment using a floorless configuration of the System that is operational while the trading floor facility is inoperable. The Exchange will operate using this configuration only until the Exchange\u2019s trading floor facility is operational. Open outcry trading will not be available in the event the trading floor becomes inoperable, except in accordance with paragraph (2) below and pursuant to Rule 5.26, as applicable.\"\n\nWord on the street this is happening Monday with more extreme travel restrictions in the US to follow but no official word yet. The second source below shows a free Silexx Pro upgrade effective immediately through April 30 2020. This is a short timeframe and suggests imminent closure of the NY Trading Floors. \n\nGood news: Markets will still be open and your put options will still work. Get ready for red Monday.\n\nSources: [https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/regulation/rule\\_filings/approved/2020/SR-CBOE-2020-019.pdf](https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/regulation/rule_filings/approved/2020/SR-CBOE-2020-019.pdf)\n\n[https://markets.cboe.com/us/options/regulation/rule\\_filings/cone/](https://markets.cboe.com/us/options/regulation/rule_filings/cone/)", "created_utc": 1584242971.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fiv3rq/trading_floors_planning_to_close_very_soon_see/", "is_self": true}
