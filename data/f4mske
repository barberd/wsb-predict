I am currently up over 70% mostly due to buying caps late in the trading day and then selling of when it jumped EVERY SINGLE MORNING around an hour or two after open. Friday afternoon couldn\u2019t have been more perfect maybe Tuesday if it doesn\u2019t jump too fast. This is there lowest dip since being upgraded, and remember stonks only go up. But calls and enjoy your tendies, you\u2019re welcome.", "created_utc": 1581834456, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f4mske/why_mu_calls_are_a_good_idea/", "is_self": true}
