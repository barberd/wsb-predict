Then you cucks will say DRILLING COMMENCED and buy up the same CCL and RCL puts you bought when they were down 15% on wednesday. VIX is telling a similar tale as last week, the MMs and Banks got a fuckton of ammo still. Jpow just gave them the last bump before you pass out for the night in the alley of a diner right before you eat at 6am.  They are gonna cuck you cucks with once again. They are fully aware of your \"strategies\" on your $SPY 3/09 220p and your 3/09 380c's, and theyll cuck em both.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut what you cucks gotta understand is the slow cuckturn is FAR better than the speed cuckturn. If we start to speed cuckturn and TRUE panic incites the markets, see 1929. In 2008 the fire had just gotten to the banks after burning through mortgage companies, 90% of bear sterns, and a bunch of other shit before Lehman tanked overnight, aig was about to fall and Hanky, Benny and Timmy realized there was a problem( only took em a year) and they must fix it. This is a different kind of panic, but if you cucks want this thing down, prepare to get mega cucked on the bread lines, have a little civility and let the market die slowly, and get cucked by MMs and banks for at least another week, unless the boomers wake up early and see cruises arent looking like a thing anymore and they realize true market panic is here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n then we are all cucked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nyou cucks.", "created_utc": 1583702238, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffjbdl/the_cuckening_is_gonna_cuck_you_cucks/", "is_self": true}
