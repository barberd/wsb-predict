{"id": "hbr72p", "title": "Why CVNA is a house of cards and cannot use the AMZN model to be profitable", "selftext": "CVNA is somehow at ATHs, even though business in the auto world came to a screeching halt in Q2.  CVNA's valuation is literally based on being \"the AMZN of cars,\" even though they cannot be profitable.  The only issue is that they will likely never be profitable, no matter what their market share is.\n\nAMZN operates on the basis, that their sellers can sell more with less overhead, and offer lower prices with greater volume.   Sounds like it could work for auto's, right?  The problem that CVNA has, is that the modern dealership makes an average of -$1000 per vehicle on the front end of their vehicles.  Yes you heard that right.  Those \"doc fees,\" and \"prep fees,\" that you all hate from dealerships?  The pushy finance guy that won't let you leave until you buy one of his warranties?  These are all things that just barely bring a dealership back to even that CVNA does not have.  Eventually a dealership will see a car in for service, or need parts or labor, two things CVNA does not have.\n\nAMZN offers lower prices, CVNA's prices are at best equal to the market.  They overpay at the auction and for trade-ins, so their front end losses are even greater than the average dealership.  Any dealership can offer a \"great experience,\" but they will go broke in the process without the benefit of VC money.\n\nNot to mention that in most dealerships, labor is not paid unless a vehicle is sold.  CVNA's labor costs of bringing the vehicle to the customer, and then fixing issues with the vehicle, post-sale is a cash burn nightmare that they disguise through their warranty company, but will eventually surface over time.  Not too mention, people still want to test drive vehicles before purchase.\n\n\"Used cars booming,\" is because there is a huge lack of supply from people not buying new vehicles.  This is why pricing is inflated, \"not because times are hard and people want pre-owned.\"  Any anecdotal stories about the pricing going crazy has nothing to do with the potential success of CVNA, as the price they pay for the vehicles goes up as well.\n\nTL:DR.  CVNA's valuation is unsustainable once people realize that it does not have the possibility of being the AMZN of cars.  \n\nEDIT POSITION: CVNA 80P 8/21 ", "created_utc": 1592529251.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hbr72p/why_cvna_is_a_house_of_cards_and_cannot_use_the/", "is_self": true}
