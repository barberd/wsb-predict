{"id": "cutwty", "title": "NETFLIX PUTS = THE BIG SHORT", "selftext": "Look. This month has been helluva up and down cuck fest with Mango Man's Trade Wars and the Fed meetings. We've all been scrambling to find new tendies every week and I realized that the best opportunity for a Big Short for EVERYONE would be to go YOLO on Netflix Puts.\n\nSince July 17th, Netflix has plummeted from $360 to $290. Their last Earnings revealed they had beaten EPS, but fell just short of Revenue expectations and Subscription numbers were only 50% of what they expected. With the current market conditions and the looming competition from Disney and Apple ahead, I doubt we'll ever see Netflix at $300 per share. \n\nI'm relatively new to options trading and currently I have ONE Put Debit Spread for NFLX at $270/265 expiring 10/18 to test this theory. Since purchasing on August 19th, the Spread is up 40%. Now my $152.50 Salesforce Calls provided me more Tendies to load up on other strike prices and expirations. I just wanted to get feedback from my fellow Autists to see if you agreed with these sentiments and if you have any recommendations for Strike Prices and Expirations. Thanks in advance bitches!", "created_utc": 1566656201, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cutwty/netflix_puts_the_big_short/", "is_self": true}
