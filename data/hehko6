{"id": "hehko6", "title": "Reverse Conversion NKLA", "selftext": "Today, Robinhood saved me.\n\nTIL about a rather odd arbitrage opportunity called **Reverse Conversion.** Basically you short the shares, buy an ITM cheap call, and sell the *expensive* *ass* (no homo) ITM put - same strike and same expiration.\n\nIn this situation it would be short NKLA 100 shares, buy $69 call for $5.20 and sell the $69 put $26.75.\n\nRegardless if NKLA tanks or goes up to 300 a share, you would profit about $2155 at expiration because the calls would hedge your short and the shorted shares will hedge against the put you sold.\n\nI was *this close* to pulling a /u/1R0NYMAN before I realized that the borrowing fee for NKLA is at 600% ! That would mean $117 borrowing fee per day for 27 days ! Borrowing fee > theta decay of the option.\n\nNot to mention that SEC filings suggest a surge in shares 2 weeks from now due to expiring warrants - whatever the fuck that means. Also read something about dilution in shares in Decemberish from VTIQ merger?\n\nLuckily, Robin in da hood doesn't allow short selling (phew). I was about to bet a million - not that I even have a million. Guess it's true what they say, if it's too good to be true you're about to pull a  /u/1R0NYMAN\n\nside note: This is probably what happened to BYND during IPO lockup period.\n\nDoes anyone know if borrowing fee changes per day or does it stay constant when you sell the shares short ?", "created_utc": 1592929029.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hehko6/reverse_conversion_nkla/", "is_self": true}
