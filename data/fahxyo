{"id": "fahxyo", "title": "What else besides obvious travel and hospitality companies will get hit hard?", "selftext": "TLDR: Buy puts on all things hospitality and leisure. And everything related to those businesses.   \n\n\nQuestion and proposed answer post.\n\nAirlines, Casinos, Hotels, Cruise liners, restaurants, concerts (Ex: Live Nation)...basically all hospitality and leisure has already been hit HARD. If they are not yet at their 52 week lows, they are going to be soon.   \nIt is only a matter of time before live nation starts cancelling events. Major sporting events are already getting cancelled. \n\nMy question and thinking is, what next? What other obvious lines of business will be hit? Where are there still large opportunities to be found?  \nSuppliers of those businesses? Sysco and Aramark are the two main suppliers for all hotels, casinos, concessions, and schools. When schools close, and no one is going to sporting events or hotels, Sysco and Aramark are going down. Hard. Aramark still has a lot of room to fall.   \n\n\nAlso, fitness is likely to get hit hard. Planet Fitness can easily go down to its 52 week of \\~$57. Currently trading at $73. They were just at an all time high. Who is going to work out in a public gym in the middle of the COVID19 outbreak? No one. Also, their entire model is a month to month subscription. What happens when 90% of people don't pay for two months that are the peak of the outbreak?   \n\n\nExample companies to buy puts on:   \n\\-EAT (Brinker)  \n\\-CAKE (Cheesecake Factory)  \n\\- YUM!  \n\\- DRI (Darden)  \n\\- LIV (Live Nation)  \n\\- TXRH (Texas Roadhouse)  \n\\- ARMK (Aramark)  \n\\-  SYY (Sysco)  \n\\- PLNT (Planet Fitness)  \n\\- BLMN (Bloomin' Brands)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat are your thoughts?", "created_utc": 1582833788, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fahxyo/what_else_besides_obvious_travel_and_hospitality/", "is_self": true}
