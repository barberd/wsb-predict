{"id": "fu06xh", "title": "The WallStreetBets retard that directly influenced the creation of the Fed", "selftext": "I think you guys will be happy to know that the Federal Reserve that is currently fucking with your tendies came about because of a Wall Street Idiot that would almost certainly browse this sub today.\n\nEvery time the Fed prints money you can thank Fredrick Augustus Heinze (and his two stupid ass brothers). This guy got some of daddy's money, got lucky, and bought a bomb ass copper mine that made him rich. I guess he got bored of that because he showed up to New York with $25 million in cash and decided he was going to swing his dick around in the financial world a little bit. Dude shows up to New York, drinks, parties, gambles and bangs whores, Frank Reynolds style. And apparently you didn't want to fuck with him and his boys. Some thugs from a rival copper company came to kick his ass at one point and he \"pound\\[ed\\] their heads in the gutter\" (according to the newspaper). The guy thought he was invincible. \n\nHe made some powerful friends partying all the time and became a director of more than a dozen banks, trust companies and insurance firms, and he had little to no financial experience. When he finally decides to learn about finance, and he goes full on [r/Wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbets/) instead of [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/). THE GUY TRIES TO EXECUTE A SHORT SQUEEZE ON HIS OWN COMPANY WITH HIS OWN MONEY ON NOTHING BUT A HUNCH. This is so dumb. Let me tell you why...\n\nHeinze decides that the gay bears are ruining his stock price by selling the stock short. When a shitload of people borrow the stock and start selling it the stock price will probably go down (supply and demand and so forth). If anyone can enlighten me as to why he thought this was happening, I couldn't find any information on it, but I imagine it was just pure autistic energy.\n\n(For the Stoolies out there that only know selling short from trying to get laid with their 2-inch wieners, a short-sale is when you 'borrow' the stock from your broker, and then sell it when you think the market price is peaking. You then pray to JPow that the stock tanks so you can buy it at a lower price and return it to the broker. The catch is, the broker can demand you give back the stock at any time, and you just have to buy it at market price to return it.)\n\nSo to get some revenge on the gay bears, Heinze ketchup decides to buy as much stock as he can to artificially inflate the price and fuck the short-sellers over, because then the short sellers would have to engage in the classic 'buy high, sell low' strategy. And the fucker actually manage to pump the stock price. He bought a shitload of stock and the price went up from $39 a share to $52 a share in one day. His brother, who owned a brokerage, then called back all the lent shares. Heinze thought that the price would moon because all the short sellers would have to buy the lent shares back at market price, and motherfucker guess what? Heinze owns most of the shares so market price is whatever he wants. But history repeats itself, and the gay bear threat was only in his mind. He 'miscalculated' how many people owned shares of his own company, thinking that all the owners were short sellers. A vast majority of the stockholders were not short sellers, they just straight up owned the stock. There was more than enough stock to being sold by owners to cover the short sellers, and then some. Everyone started selling to cash in on the exorbitantly high stock price. This caused a selling frenzy and the stock price tanked to around $10 and old Heinze was left holding the bag on his own company.\n\nThis might not have been a problem, but this scumbag trader was also a scumbag director of more than a dozen banks, trust companies and insurance firms and people didn't like that. Seeing how fast tendies could burn in the oven, and losing trust in the banks that this guy was associated with, people went to get their money. The trust companies at the time didn't have the money because they were unregulated as fuck so they collapsed and shit went downhill from there... and long story short the Fed gets invented and in the magic year of 2020 they introduced unlimited QE and it makes a lot of Special Education survivors unhappy as hell.\n\nPositions: GUSH 69c 4/20", "created_utc": 1585882016.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fu06xh/the_wallstreetbets_retard_that_directly/", "is_self": true}
