I know, I can select \"show price as percentage\" on the price axis. But I don't want to keep changing it as I like to see the price on the price axis (Y-axis instead of the %). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs there a way I can see the % change in the price? Is it displayed somewhere like the price of the stock on the top bar? I couldnt find it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNeed your help? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS: new to thinkorswim\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/i5d6rhtx69631.png", "created_utc": 1561360902, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c4jol1/how_to_see_change_of_a_stock_thinkorswim_td/", "is_self": true}
