Y'all are forgetting two things:\n\n1) the market already shit itself in March. Remember all those limit-down days when Robinhood robbed you of $4.13 in tendies? Q1 performance is expected to suck. This is the literal definition of priced in. \n\n2) the only forward info people care about is how many reams of JPow bux companies are getting. This is winners and losers time. If you're getting a bailout, you'll be flat on shit guidance with stacks on stacks of MMT funny money to float you or you'll crash on a modestly negative outlook with no support.\n\nI never thought I'd see the day when autists ignored the autisim in others in favor of fundamentals.", "created_utc": 1586783428.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0ina1/before_you_pin_your_hopes_on_earnings_to_make/", "is_self": true}
