But now it's starting to spread more and LA ports, SF ports, and NY ports are all going to deny cruise docking to the point where people won't do a cruise to avoid this shit of a hassle + quarantine risk. Americans HATE feeling uncomfortableness / uncertainty and will decide to postpone cruises.\n\nAs it already is, these cruise ships are half full and people are canceling so it isn't unreasonable to believe that the people thinking \"oh its a great sale\" are going to stop thinking that once the actual government makes an official statement telling Americans to skip cruises and only do essential traveling for a few months to prevent beer virus spread. You could argue that the drop today in cruise stocks was the impact, but no way.. now that people will be told to stop going on them, they will listen and it should drop like 6-10% since the last of men going on cruises are now being taken away from cruise companies.\n\nI bought CCL 26.5p 3/13s this morning. Seems like the fed Is trying really hard to keep these guys alive but clearly airline companies are more important so they are the ones who really have the fed's backs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - the hopeful people who think cruises are 'on sale' right now are about to take some horse shit to their faces once they realize the government is going to discourage cruises. impact not fully realized yet. buy puts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: people are saying IV is so high... so what? I bought CCL puts today not even at the peak and im up 20% on them. you'll make good money from the stock price drop.
