These are people who have been posting on the same boards for 10+ years.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FNMA/community/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FNMA/community/)\n\n[https://investorshub.advfn.com/Fannie-Mae-FNMA-13035/](https://investorshub.advfn.com/Fannie-Mae-FNMA-13035/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**They are the vanguards of #Fanniegate.** At first I laughed and trolled. Then I studied and learned. Now my portfolio is up  almost 200% just on FNMA and FMCC commons. If you haven't heard of #fanniegate, the time is now. There is no greater WSB roll of the dice than betting on politians keeping their promises.  I sold all my 87.5 QCOM CALLs for 90% loss and moved my entire portfolio into Fannie Mae.
