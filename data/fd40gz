Obviously that would be the case considering most of the numbers reported so far reflect only January and early February. \n\n[According to the calendar,](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/calendar) the first impactful economic data reports will begin reporting on the 17th with the retail sales report for February, a Fed presser on the 18th, and jobless claims up to March 14th reporting on the 19th. After the weekend, we get slapped 3 days in a row with the PMI, durable goods orders, and quarterly GDP report released on the 26th. \n\nIn the US, the virus has not been identified as a pandemic as of this rate decision. **If this the CDC or WHO lab coat boys use the P-word, the market will shit the bed. Only this will cause any sustained market movement downwards until the 17th.**\n\nTLDR: Useless data until the 17th. Market direction decided by the CDC until then.", "created_utc": 1583279620, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fd40gz/no_data_driven_drops_this_month_cdc_in_charge_now/", "is_self": true}
