{"id": "dzc89z", "title": "spy puts March 30th, 2020", "selftext": "Hey folks today\u2019s intraday market sell-off was quite sharp, showing how things can nose-dive quite quickly. This reminds me of the days that we had prior to December 26th of last year, where there wasn\u2019t necessarily much going on economically but markets did a massive sell-off. I think this is certainly catalyzed by automated trading platforms from hedge-funds that notice the smallest downward slopes and sell off to protect assets (think flash crash 2010). \nEven though I\u2019m a bull, I think you gotta play it safe and hedge your portfolio in this economy by buying some long term spy puts that are in the ball park of 270. I noticed that the march 2020 puts that hover around 260-270 area have a lot of OI rn on them. I think a lot of big money is either a) buying insurance to protect assets or b) betting that there will be a sudden sell off like december 26th time last year. Even if you\u2019re not that into insurance and playing it safe, a long term spy put could potentially quadruple in a split second if spy goes down to 280-290. So yeah this is my two cents.", "created_utc": 1574301898, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dzc89z/spy_puts_march_30th_2020/", "is_self": true}
