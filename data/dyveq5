Let me start by saying feel free to ask me any question and remember to stay safe when trading. Do so at your own risk!\n\nLet me explain what happened:\nI started trading options on robinhood about three months ago. Started off well and got carried away and began taking bigger and bigger risks. Usually through out of the money options. I eventually was making trades of around $30'000 and holding for only a few seconds sometimes. I then got my first big loss. From there the downfall sped up until I reached a point of no return. There were many more mistakes that I explain in my youtube video but one of the main ones is trying to hard and quickly to recuperate the losses by taking huge loses. Like I said if you want to know more details let me know.\n\nPS: I think I deserve a upvote. Losing $30'000 in \"ONLY\" 3 months might be a new record for Wall Street Bets hahah\n\nMore details in my YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bobVfAn8WlI", "created_utc": 1574217604, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dyveq5/how_i_lost_over_30000_trading_robinhood_options/", "is_self": true}
