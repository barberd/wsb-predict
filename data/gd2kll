Or, is Lyft smart to stick with one, consistent stream? both bigly bad this week", "selftext": "To the mods: I had to repost again bc when editing I lost most of the post.\n\ntl:dr: UBER and LYFT are fucked this week. Market will definitely crash *again*. I think UBER is shitter than LYFT because UBER increases how much it loses with EATS as it *gains* *more* users. Lyft at least has been losing less over the past few quarters. I'm short UBER and may also buy Lyft puts. If Lyft becomes cheap, like \\~$5B market cap, I'll probably go long and hard.\n\nDisclaimer: This isn't invesment advice and always do your own DD and come to your own conclusions. Don't just trust a Brando drinking retard sitting and typing bigly words on a sweet, sweet lit-up keyboard that was clearly ingrained in him the difference versus a need and a want.\n\nSome folks may be interested  and already looking at the two major ridesharing companies: UBER &  LYFT.  I've generally favored LYFT over UBER because it isn't trying to  do (and fail) at more than rideshare (the primary biz function); yes,  both lose money and are in hyper-growth mode but being *better* at losing money in *more*  ways doesn't bode well, especially when it detracts from the  aforementioned core biz.  UBER is definitely succeeding in losing money  in ever more (not so) creative ways.\n\nAs earnings approach for these rideshare innovators, below is some  info for readers to peruse as their crayon-eating time frees up. As  always, do your DD and make us proud.  Else, you're relegated to  drinking piss in your mom's basement. I get that might be appealing to  some, but whatever, some of you get it.\n\nLooking at 2018 to 2019 figures.\n\n[LYFT](https://investor.lyft.com/financial-information/sec-filings) | [Insider Trades](http://openinsider.com/screener?s=LYFT&o=&pl=&ph=&ll=&lh=&fd=730&fdr=&td=0&tdr=&fdlyl=&fdlyh=&daysago=&xp=1&xs=1&vl=&vh=&ocl=&och=&sic1=-1&sicl=100&sich=9999&grp=0&nfl=&nfh=&nil=&nih=&nol=&noh=&v2l=&v2h=&oc2l=&oc2h=&sortcol=0&cnt=100&page=1) | [Latest 10K](https://investor.lyft.com/static-files/981ad93a-5d97-4f7f-8937-5682ca83cba7)\n\n1. *Net Loss* increased from -42.3 to -72%. For 2019, 174.7% of their revenue is *Total Costs and Expenses.* Lyft only does rideshare and their R&D increase a bit closer to 3x versus Uber's \\~2.5x.

(pg. 65)\n\nLyft had a huge loss of $48.53/share for quarter end in March 2019;  though EPS has seems to have stabilized and loss/share decreasing each  quarter with Dec 2019 having a -$1.19 EPS.  It appears that this was  mostly due to R&D increasing 6x and G&A \\~3x from prior quarter  (pgs. 70-71). The percentage breakdown is more clear on pg. 70, as aside from R&D and G&A in March 2019, the Net Loss seems to be going in the  right direction.\n\nThe *Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows* seems to show that Lyft is burning through *less* cash each year, as reported on the *Net cash used in operating activities* line item.

For 2019, 161% of their revenue is *Total Costs and Expenses*. Even though their top lines are increasing for rideshare or Eats, 14 and 72%, respectively, for 2018 to 2019, their *Loss from operations* more than doubled from -27% to -61%.  This led to a .

(pg. 112)\n\nEats and Freight are growing revenue far more than rideshare with 82  and 105%, respectively (pg. 61).  Then looking at the next page, it  shows segment adjusted EBITDA.  It seems rideshare is doing OK,  generating an adjusted profit which *increased* 34% from 2018.  However, Eats was a *loss*  and for year ends 2018 and 2019 losses increase 69 and 128%,  respectively.  This is what I've been worried about with Uber; this  diversified segment is more of a hindrance than an advantage over Lyft.   This is even thought the gross bookings are seeing 164 and 83%  increases for year ends 2018 and 2019, respectively. They're losing *more* money as they gain more market share in each of these non-rideshare segments.\n\nThe *Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows* seems to show that Uber is burning through *more* cash each year, as reported on the *Net cash used in operating activities* line item. (pg. 84)\n\nIt'll be interesting to see what quarter-end March '20 will look like  when they report.  For same Q ends in 2018 and 2019 we had a $2.00 and  -$2.23 basic EPS, respectively. (pg. 87)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThis is just the start of some more DD that I'll cap off tomorrow.   However, I'm sticking with the thesis that Uber is still struggling with  Eats (and its other bets) for the foreseeable future. In my mind, this  is a hugh negative. If I wanted to invest in ridesharing, I'd be long  Lyft and short Uber.\n\nPositions - UBER $28P May 8", "created_utc": 1588556471.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gd2kll/is_uber_diversifying_its_tendie_stream_or_is_lyft/", "is_self": true}
