{"id": "hbhwqk", "title": "Purple (PRPL) - Reasons to be SHORT", "selftext": "I recently saw for the 10th time in a month or so a post about about PRPL, a matress company.. and why this company would be \u201cmeme stock\u201d. When I challenged the poster about anything related to the company the poster became agitated and had a bit of a retard rage attack. See for yourself.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hb6qfv/prpl\\_is\\_the\\_next\\_meme\\_stock/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hb6qfv/prpl_is_the_next_meme_stock/)\n\nHowever, what really got me was when i warned others to do addl DD before jumping in with a large postion, poster said that he did enough DD already- why bother?\n\nSeems a few friends that he claims not to know are in this stock for around 5 million dollars. There is always more DD and always an inverse to what someone else says to be fair.\n\nHere is the other side to the info that has been prevalent on this sub about this mattress company- starting with general float of the stock which they have conveniently left out.\n\n**Float here: This is considered a low float**\n\n* **Finviz:** 21.63\n* **Yahoo:** 14.99M\n* **Short:** 10.49%\n* \\*\\*Insider:\\*\\* 7.90%\n* **Tutes:** 89.00%\n* \\*\\*Cap:\\*\\*998.73M\n\nThis tells me that of the 15-20mm shares outstanding, insiders own 1 million, and tutes own 13.3 million. That leaves only 5.5 million commons avail for retail. Being that tutes own most, the price basically is being pushed around by whats left of these retail traders.\n\nThat said, this is ALREADY heavily shorted at over 10%.\n\nThe fact that there are so few share available to retail makes this a VERY low float which is subject to major price manipulation even selling as little as 10k worth of shares.\n\nIf the price starts to fall, the shorts will be in complete and total control.\n\n**2. Offerings**\n\nPRPL has already given a couple offerings in the last couple months- further diluting value of the stock.  If youre holding when they announce another offering, its possible that the shares absolutely tank citing the float about.\n\n**May-19-20 04:05PM**[Purple Innovation, Inc. Announces Closing of Secondary Public Offering of Class A Common Stock](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/purple-innovation-inc-announces-closing-200500900.html)**May-14-20 07:59PM**[Purple Innovation, Inc. Announces Pricing of Upsized Secondary Public Offering of Class A Common Stock](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/purple-innovation-inc-announces-pricing-235900158.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3.** Its fucking mattresses and pillows FFS. SUre they are backed up in orders for now, but at some point, every rich person will have thier PRPL mattress and sales can slump. These are not bargain mattresses that are recycled yearly and used in hotels. There is a saturation point, and it is possible they are approaching that.\n\nThe leading mattress and sleep company tempurpedic sealy has been flat for like 5 years. If matresses you're golden goose? Maybe. Probably not.\n\nMoral being dont take what anyone who is levered to the gills in one company tells you. Especially if they get agitated when you question them- they may be trying to screw you over. Best luck to those on either side of these trades.\n\nPRPL may very well moon and turn into a multi bagger but if that was so true why is it being pumped like an up and coming actress trying to make it in hollywood on every platform?", "created_utc": 1592497624.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hbhwqk/purple_prpl_reasons_to_be_short/", "is_self": true}
