They're about to hit all time highs around $159 which is all revolved around \"everyone is using zoom they will probably go up\" -every fucking boomer on the planet. This shit stock meme stock whatever  you wanna call it is not lasting through our next leg down (last post says it all). Up 321% on the year? Because they make a few extra bucks? Purely off hype just like tesla is except tsla actually makes a valuable product, not some platform with hackers literally data mining and selling children's log in information on the dark web.\n\nOnce zoom hits 160 grab your entire portfolio sell your shitty stocks that only gain 1% a day and dump it into ZM 5/22 $100p and watch that become a 10x bagger.\n\nOf course this is pure speculation and zoom will probably come out with a phone or some shit and fuck me and my puts up to -99%... BUT if I am right I can assure a 10x play.\n\n# tldr; ZM 5/22 100p @ $2.45\n\nedit: typos because i failed my english 101 class", "created_utc": 1586971152.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1waoo/literal_free_money_on_zoom_zm_puts/", "is_self": true}
