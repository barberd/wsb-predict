{"id": "gelc2x", "title": "$VIRT: Overlooked high frequency traders always make tons during volatility, and they have earnings tomorrow AM. Buy some calls.", "selftext": "I have a position of 11 absurdly-the-fuck out-of-the-money calls in a company called **Virtu Financial.** Here's why you should consider doing something similar.\n\nVirtu Financial is a market-maker that unsurprisingly, relies on high-frequency trading for a lot of what they do. For those of you who don't know either of those terms, look them up on Investopedia.\n\nHigh frequency trading, generally speaking, realizes considerably better profits during periods of high volatility. Like, for example, the unexpected spike in market volatility during Feb/March 2018. During those two months, Virtu jumped from about 19 to about 38, a **92% increase.** [Here's an article about it](https://qz.com/1203388/high-frequency-traders-like-virtu-financial-and-flow-traders-are-celebrating-the-return-of-market-volatility/):\n\n[https://qz.com/1203388/high-frequency-traders-like-virtu-financial-and-flow-traders-are-celebrating-the-return-of-market-volatility/](https://qz.com/1203388/high-frequency-traders-like-virtu-financial-and-flow-traders-are-celebrating-the-return-of-market-volatility/)\n\nVirtu made an absolute killing for a few months, but came back down to earth by August.\n\nFast forward to 2020. **Virtu went through something extremely similar this year in late Feb,** when the world fucking ended, jumping from 18 to 24 a share, or a change of about **29%** until mid March, when at which point it came back down to more or less where it started. It has slowly risen since, and opened today at about 25.\n\nVirtu reports earnings tomorrow morning. There is no way they don\u2019t beat it, and probably crush it and give completely insane guidance for the rest of the year. No matter where you stand politically, it is extremely difficult to pretend that the market won\u2019t continue to be volatile, even if it stays up. Virtu is perfectly positioned to continue to make a killing for the rest of 2020.\n\nHere\u2019s the fun part. Virtu has just this week started [expanding their executive team](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/virtu-announces-appointments-co-presidents-113010138.html):\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/virtu-announces-appointments-co-presidents-113010138.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/virtu-announces-appointments-co-presidents-113010138.html)\n\nThey are bringing back a CFO who left last year and making him Co-President. Why does their executive team matter? These guys are as plugged in as anyone. Exhibit A: their founder, board member, and chairman emeritus: Vincent Viola. He is a billionaire who Trump nominated to be Secretary of the Army back in 2017, but politely declined, presumably out of a desire to remain a private citizen who makes money hand over fist. He also owns an NHL team, which, hey, has nothing to do with anything, but that's fun, right? Here\u2019s a quote from him on CNBC:\n\n**\u201cI am of the opinion that the marketplace is just one big opportunity right now,\u201d Viola said. \u201cAgain, the sectors, that remains for the personal financial advisor. From my perspective, there are structural changes in the economy that are going to provide for long-term growth for more than one industry.\u201d**\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/06/virtu-financial-founder-says-stock-market-is-one-big-opportunity-right-now.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/06/virtu-financial-founder-says-stock-market-is-one-big-opportunity-right-now.html)\n\nRead between the lines of a guy who Trump wanted to lead the fucking Army: This isn\u2019t just a few volatile months, this is a new volatile normal. Virtu is a company almost perfectly designed and positioned to squeeze every fucking penny out of market conditions like this.\n\n**MY POSITION:** I have 11 $30 6/19 calls in $Virt and later today will probably get more calls across the board for that expy.\n\n**TLDR:** Virtu ($VIRT) is a high frequency trading company that makes tons of money during periods of high volatility, it\u2019s also founded by a billionaire with direct ties to the Trump administration who seems pretty optimistic.\n\n**EVEN MORE TLDR:** Buy $VIRT calls and let rich people getting richer make you less poor.", "created_utc": 1588776328.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gelc2x/virt_overlooked_high_frequency_traders_always/", "is_self": true}
