Stock went from ~5 - $24 overnight after approval and dropped precipitously after they decided to go with a business plan of raising money and building manufacturing and distribution up instead of looking for an acquisition which is the typical move for biotech research companies that get a new FDA approval. \n\nTo understand their product- \ntheir drug reduces triglycerides significantly and there are pretty much no other drugs that do this. My dad knows ALOT about triglycerides. So does yours. Anyway back to how you will become so rich you will need a lot of Vascepa to bring down your Tri\u2019s because you are a sloppy fat rich pig who sleeps in a trough of $Ca$H$.\n\nYou may have seen other posts on AMRN recently this is a sum up of key points:\n\n-Massive quarterly growth and increase in revenue averaged at about 106% over expectations quarterly since approval \n\n-outperforms small cap biotech and pharm companies by a factor of ~3 in growth and is priced below the industry average and at ~$17.50 about the lowest prices it\u2019s been since drug approval.\n\n-they have extremely prudent resource management and have reinvested heavily into vertical integration that will see their yearly growth sky rocket as their margins will be way higher and costs way lower\n\n-133m$ in sales revenue expected to go up atleast 85% at earnings call on 02/25. The demand for this drug is huge and as they\u2019ve had to focus on growth to increase production they haven\u2019t been able to meet the demand so the potential is huge. Now they\u2019re ready to pump. Demand is already at over 1B and they don\u2019t really need to market much because of this, their expected sales next year are 1B.\n\n-profitability is a key inflection point for this type of company and expect to see them finally in profit territory as their Q3 eps was -.01 so they were right on the brim of the Tit\n\n-it\u2019s gone down to 17.50 from 22.5 this month due to people flocking at relative highs because the stock traded in a tight range for the last year and a half never going below 17 really and never above 23.l since approval. As soon as it hits the high people have been buying puts and making money. Yesterday it\u2019s options volume was one of the highest in the entire Stonk Market and people were dumping there 04/20 puts like they had IBS and trust me my dad taught me a lot about IBS. (He\u2019s a GI physician so he has seen more boomer dumps than any trader on this sub. He lives off boomer dumps)\n\n-EXPECT this to go to minimum 22 quick as that is the value with strong outlook priced in...then when the smart motherfuckers who bought calls yesterday will ride the Bear In Minds who have been trying to push this stock down into ...you guessed it...the fucking MOON. This company is going to be fucking huge and they are a major acquisition target but they\u2019ve constantly chose to grow their business instead and will likely eventually start picking up other companies that have drugs in development and have other stuff in their pipeline as research is their core competency. If you realized that negative earnings meNt nothing for SPCE this company was -356 million debt with 0 revenue and burning through huge amounts of money. for years. \n\n\n\nMarket cap of 2-300m and technically worth way less than nothing.  In 2 years they are a 6.5B cap about to have 1B in sales and massive growth which will rise exponentially. The stock is EXTREMELY undervalued, the smartypantses are already loading in on calls and the earnings will light the fuse.\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\n02/28 23.5c= .02 x100= 2 fucking dollars per contract. This is like getting in to SPCE when your mom was still a Virgin.\ud83e\udd30\ud83e\udd31\n\n\nTime to Eat.\nNot tendies tho cuz you gotta keep them for liquidity", "created_utc": 1582307101, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7eorf/amrn_from_someone_who_has_followed_the_stock_for/", "is_self": true}
