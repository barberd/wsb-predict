THIS SHIT IS OLD MONEY LIKE ROCKEFELLER, ALONG WITH AUTISMO FAVORITES LIKE INTC, AAPL, NKE, DIS AND OF COURSE MSFT.\n\n5G? CSCO HAS BEEN MAKING THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THAT SINCE YOUR MOM TURNED HER FIRST TRICK. VERIZON CALLS CSCO DADDY.\n\nITS ON SALE MORE THAN THAT CRACK WHORE OUTSIDE YOUR LOCAL KMART.\n\nThanks for coming to my ted talk.\n\nSo buy this with reasonable strikes and expirations.
