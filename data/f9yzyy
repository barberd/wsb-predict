SQ also lowballed EPS and Revenue guidance last quarter, making this quarter much easier to beat. However, with the global slowdown due to coronavirus, forward guidance will become very important. Square cannot sandbag guidance this quarter as any weakness shown will be exposed. \n\n**Technical**: Priced above 50 and 200 day moving averages, below 20D average. MACD shows bullish convergence. RSI shows around 45, neutral. Options sentiments are bullish in volume and bearish open interest. Implied movement is 8.6% or about 6.64$\n\n**Sentimental**: Square is looking to massively beat EPS and Revenue, and is set up to guide even higher in 2020. The key concern here is the public perception and intense macro fear. **This large negative macro will affect positive earnings negatively, as it prevents a lot of buyers from jumping due to macro fear.** All things aside, square should come out of the earnings on top, but we don\u2019t know how the market will react to a win. \n\n**ROI : 20%**\n\n**Risk Level - 3 of 5, Risky**\n\n**Close fast if profitable. Square has a very consistent tendency to go lower regardless of earnings the week after.  Sell call credit spreads a week further out if you know how.** \n\n[Robinhood SS](https://imgur.com/a/NUj1iRI)", "created_utc": 1582746564, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9yzyy/square_sq_2262020_amc_big_beat_now_what/", "is_self": true}
