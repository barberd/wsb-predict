Trump administration just green lit open churches for memorial day weekend and 95% of states are opening up by end of May. (as we saw look what happened to spy due to increase in spending) We will discuss its beta further down below. If you look up Kroger's resistance, its about to cross over its first one looking at the graph end of Friday May, 22, 2020. (not depicted in graph below). A big indicator of whether or not Kroger will do good is by looking at Costco's in next week's earnings. However, Costco has an expensive subscription program that Kroger does not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kphqoszke8151.png?width=2146&format=png&auto=webp&s=02077c515178031fe3d277c74cc4ed9653dd93b4\n\n2018-2019 profit margin went down due to increased spending eating out. Fast food industries such as chipotle and mcdonalds are hitting record highs during this period. Kroger reported first quarter earnings this year and beat giving it its first price increase of the year and has a YEARLY INCREASE in dividend. A very bullish sign. It is currently ranked as undervalued as you can see in the pictures below further and has an average inventory turnover of 13 days with asset turnover being 2.7. I believe this number will be even lower during its earnings report due to the panic spending of the corona virus with \"SHRINK\" decreasing. Shrink is spoiled food or waste that they throw out because it cannot be sold even though sometimes it is perfectly good.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nmhc1m0ne8151.png?width=2054&format=png&auto=webp&s=63879124eab7ff88dffcb519f77f62821da30479\n\nUndervalued, high quality company, growth is increasing as Kroger expands and is financially healthy. Kroger is also recession and corona proof with a beta of -.02. Is inverses the market. If the market tanks, Kroger increase in price in theory. However we all know this market is very volatile and that valuations are now based off FUTURE CASH FLOWS that Kroger will be like Target from 2019.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ft7ms9mne8151.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=743690d36e41403b6073f35177a3bf088527bb6f\n\n3/4 analysts rate a long buy with one indicating a hold. UPDATE: THE HOLD WAS FROM ZACHS INVESTMENT AND JUST GOT UPGRADED TO A BUY. With descriptions saying outpacing Walmart in terms of shares price increasing in growth over time.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g6rn2qcoe8151.png?width=2098&format=png&auto=webp&s=759703446e5d7564b4ca55dd9841a0731509ccf0\n\n2007-2008 earnings during the begining of the recession. Kroger beat earnings and went up 10/12 times with prices fluxating in between earnings. Kroger is cheap if you are a rewards member and you get nice deals on gas. They in 35 states and have been constantly replenishing inventory at a rapid pace while selling out of products. They also have a lot of subsidiaries such as Ralphs. If you go google Kroger's subsidiaries there is a list of about 30 companies.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9py3zreue8151.png?width=1468&format=png&auto=webp&s=a45b70b4bb241f8a1169e76ef1ae808138a56d5f\n\nKey Statistics about Kroger regarding the industry depicted below.\n\n[Equity Summary score of 9.5 and a beta of -.02. P\\/e is half of the industry average HOWEVER, 52 price week performance is the greatest out of its competitors listed below beating Walmart as much as 10&#37;.](https://preview.redd.it/m8amd3vue8151.png?width=1622&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e1ffe3db79899382d134e5fb87b107d66f4783d)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gze1xtcve8151.png?width=1502&format=png&auto=webp&s=480650bd1489df6587922ff619185279736b3a77\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrently the RSI is at 64. Neither quite yet overbought indicating an entry chance. (THIS HAS CHANGED I BELIEVE RSI LAST WAS 46).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrently, Calls for June 19th are very cheap with June 18 being earnings day.
