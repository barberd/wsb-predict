{"id": "ecbub6", "title": "$MU Earnings", "selftext": "So, $MU will report earnings AMC today.\n\nDRAM and NAND prices are at their bottom which should result in them missing expectations.\n\nHowever, analysts are saying that DRAM and NAND prices will see a soar in 2020, therefore MU could raise their guidance as this wasn't previously known.\n\nFurthermore, $MU has seen a huge gain in the last 3 days because analysts uped their targets, even to 80$.\n\nI cannot really decide what to expect from their earnings call. I think they will miss expectations from this quarter but raise guidance for the next one which SHOULD result in the stonk going up.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?", "created_utc": 1576671301, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ecbub6/mu_earnings/", "is_self": true}
