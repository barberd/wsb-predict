{"id": "emqtqv", "title": "LinkedIn &gt; Instagram?", "selftext": "I\u2019ve posted many a goldmine on here and here is my latest.\n\nI am hoping for a well informed, meaningful debate so I came to the busiest hive of intellectuals I know of. \n \nMy apologies, I am not going to call you retaRts or autists for free upvotes. I\u2019ll treat you like the gentlemen you are... and then take you out to dinner... and then fuck you.\n\nSorry. So right now, all the popular people are influencing all the other people on Insta and getting paid mega bucks.  Those bucks are heavily restricted.  KimK and all the others are restricted to marketing what?  SAY IT WITH ME.  LOW BARRIER RETAIL GOODS.\n\nDrinks, sandals, makeup, subscriptions, parties, and a bunch of shit that most big bad business people don\u2019t give a shit about.\n\nThey cannot sell software (salesforce, AWS), airplane parts, security systems and IT, industrial manufacturing lines, private equity channels, water systems, electricity, office space, waste management, pipelines, street lights.  To summarize, Instagram can\u2019t sell big ticket items and big services (over 90% of the economy).\n\nFor people trying to sell those things, they only currently have traditional media streams. \n\nNow Imagine an inevitable world where the biggest influencers are Doug McMillon, CEO of Walmart, Chief of IT, Director of sales, etc. how much would I pay for one of them to hawk my product, millions and millions.\n\nThis WILL happen. Gradually, CEOs and the like will be more public online social figures, not number crunchers and operators.  Those people will still be at the top, but not the very top anymore. Hiring a new CEO for Sysco will become more of a review of social presence + leadership and know how and everything else.  In 10 years, it will feel silly to hire someone to head your company that has little or no online presence.\n\nWhen people see that they can make big money on LinkedIn, insta influencers will flock to it (\u201cI\u2019m ceo of my cool makeup business, bleh bleh, and they will make some change and then quickly fade out, to be supplanted by reals.\n\nNext point...\n\nInsta will fall out of favor.  This just happens. Sorry Zuck.\n\nNext point...\n\nCan you believe we live in a world today where you can put anything on your resume and no one can check it?  I used to work for Chad, CEO of protein powder where I exceeded all my goals every month and doubled sales.  Here is my brothers phone number who will answer as Chad.\n\nThis is not long meant for this world.  The days are over. If you worked at subway, then you worked at subway.  It will become strange to see someone applying who has no professional online presence. Think FB 2012.\n\nNext point...\n\nWho\u2019s on LinkedIn and what is it?\n\nAlmost no one is on it. Bill gates gets like 2,000 likes for a post. CEO of spank girl is like the hottest thing going... \nTHAT is a classic value play. Nowhere to go but up.\n\nWhat is it? To most people, it is some website they tried once a long time ago and now emails them like 4 times a day.  They have been quietly working on their app, news feed, content, and algorithms to make it a much better product. It is. I see a lot more activity on there from a lot more important people than I used to.\nIMO, pretty fun app now.\n\nNext point,...\n\nWe are in \u201cwhat to do limbo\u201d in terms of what to do when you lose a job.  We know why people used to do, what do you do now?\n\nDo you post it on Snap, TT, Insta, or anywhere? No. Do you make a mass group email and email it to your professional network, because you have all of their emails ready to go? No. Do you text ya bois? No.  LinkedIn is the only option going forward.\n\nWhere do you find out who\u2019s hiring and who to talk to? All on LinkedIn.\n\nGlassdoor, Indeed, ZIP, etc... ALL of them are trying to build a social network out of their product. It will never work.\n\nThere is only LinkedIn, and it is massively undervalued. It will be unheard of in the near future to not have a robust profile and presence on LinkedIn. In 10-20 years when boomers retire, it will be a fully mature product.\n\nWhat do you think? \n\nLinkedIn &gt; Insta?\n\nDo you agree with the timeframe?", "created_utc": 1578662447, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/emqtqv/linkedin_instagram/", "is_self": true}
