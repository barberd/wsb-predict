So the last couple of days, the quarter results have taken all the focus from the coronavirus. Now, during the current insecurities in the market, I am a bear. Now, I personally think that it's a good thing that the focus has been taken away from the coronavirus for the moment. I think that this will create an opportunity window this weekend. I think that the oil price will continue rising until friday, a few hours before market close. Then the market will be insecure about what coronavirus news will come over the weekend. Now I personally think that the coronavirus infections have an exponential growth. If that is the case, the number of people infected will rise tremendously over the weekend. I am then imagining another significant drop in the oil price when market opens on monday. Now because of this, I am planning to buy a unlimited turbo short over the weekend. I am thinking gearing somewhere between X10 and X25 short. I am thinking about doing this short because I have a strong belief that the oil price is going to start falling on friday, and then have a significant drop over the weekend. So I am just wondering what would be lowball gearing for this bet, and what would be out of your mind 99% guaranteed to lose your bet gearing?\n\nTHIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVISE - I AM SIMPLY LOOKING FOR IDEAS ABOUT WHAT THE MAX GEARING I SHOULD HOLD OVER A WEEKEND IS WITHOUT BEING AN IDIOT.", "created_utc": 1580299251, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/evlymt/shorting_oil_what_is_the_maximum_gearing_i_should/", "is_self": true}
