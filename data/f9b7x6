I purchased an ULTA 9/27 $250 Call on 9/3 for $610 and then another at $310 the next day. For some reason Robinhood recorded the second transaction as $875.02 on my 1099B. I sold both at $44.98 at a loss and the calculations got super fucked at left me with $565.02 in Wash Sales Disallowed.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo check your shit and let me know if anyone's experiencing the same issue; my only theory is that I was using Robinhood Gold at the time and something went wrong with debiting from my Cash account + Margin account.", "created_utc": 1582641678, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9b7x6/robinhood_users_beware_check_your_1099b_before/", "is_self": true}
