{"id": "hekju0", "title": "Return of the Tendies: DBX", "selftext": "Listen up retards, \n\nFirst time posting any kind of analysis. I'll dumb it down for you all. TLDR and positions at the bottom.\n\n[DBX](http://imgur.com/a/JYW0FsS)\nSee this chart on DropBox? It shows 2 big indicators of moving up. \n\n1) 20 and 50 day moving average are on an uptrend\n2) macd is about to cross over. \n\nWhat is macd? You don't really care, do you? You autists have already scrolled to the bottom for a strike and experation. All you need to know is when the red line crosses over the blue line stocks go up. And it has just started to cross.\n\nThe only indication of a possible downtrend is the stock is slightly overbought. But i don't give a fuck. I just made 2k on apple calls and now I'm putting the profits into the next move. Feel free to jump on. Or don't. I really don't give a fuck.\n\n\n\nPosition: http://imgur.com/a/qEDDCbq\n\nTLDR: DropBox goes up. Retards make tendies.\n25c 7/17", "created_utc": 1592938461.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hekju0/return_of_the_tendies_dbx/", "is_self": true}
