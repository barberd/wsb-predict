I would bet other brokers have the same policy, since they only seem to impose the rule because of FINRA anyway.\n\n\\*\\*It can take a full business day to remove the flag\\*\\*, but you can still close positions or do pretty much anything other than day trades.\n\nIf anyone has specifics for other brokers (specifically Robinhood) I would like to know their policies as well.", "created_utc": 1591622856.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gyzbde/td_will_unflag_your_account_3_times_per_rolling/", "is_self": true}
