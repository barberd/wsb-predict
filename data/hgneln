Go clean dishes at wendies rest of ur life coz ur dog would probably make more money than you do.\n\nTimes have changed, no longer are the markets what it used to be. People are building some kind of resistance to these kind of events and as time goes on, the stock market will become some kind of safe haven asset just like gold. Holding onto cash is probably the most braindead move of em all. When shit goes down the road, a piece of paper aint gna do nething for u.\n\n\"Wahh the market is so weird now, it doesnt make sense anymore\". GTFO and go clean dishes. Trends change. If u cant adapt to new environments, this is not for u.\n\nThats my take and im off to clean dishes. peace.", "created_utc": 1593233485.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hgneln/market_will_crash_quit_trading_and_go_clean_dishes/", "is_self": true}
