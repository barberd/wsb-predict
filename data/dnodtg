{"id": "dnodtg", "title": "Confused rn", "selftext": "Alright a couple of questions on options. Let\u2019s say I buy a contract calling amd 32.50 nov 1 for 1.67 per option. If amd surges after the earnings report to let\u2019s say 35.5, I\u2019m having trouble on knowing what the profit will be. To close out the position wouldn\u2019t it be (35.5-32.50-1.67)(100)=133. Cause I know the contract gains or loses value over time depending on iv, decay etc. I also heard most people don\u2019t exercise options they just sell. So would I make 133 or would I sell the contract to someone else at a price greater than 1.67 per option. \nI would be performing the call with very little on the account obviously. So I don\u2019t know if RH or TOS would let me the chance to buy the stock and then sell.\n\n\nSo if amd hits 35.5 is the math like that or will it depend on the market currently since I don\u2019t have cash to cover the stock.\n\nAnother question would be if I sell the call option couldn\u2019t I be forced later to buy the 100 stocks.\nAlso I sometimes see people here making huge losses/gains sometimes. So that occurs if the option is exercised since they would be making a difference on the price of the stock or are they making huge losses/gains by selling the option to someone else at a higher/lower price.\n\nIf anyone could clear this up for me that would be very helpful.
