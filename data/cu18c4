Also making the list of SHEconomy picks are Sephora (OTCPK:LVMHF), Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA), Chipotle (NYSE:CMG), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).", "created_utc": 1566497406, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cu18c4/looks_like_morgan_stanley_stole_our_becky_idea/", "is_self": true}
