They\u2019re in a shitload of debt they can\u2019t get out of because they spent $12B on a buyout in \u201818. \n\n16B Market Cap, trading at $67. \n\nOption volume sucks, but that's the price you pay.\n\nInterest coverage: 1.09\n\nQuick & Current Ratio: 0.52 & .9 respectively\n\nDebt/Equity: 1.73\n\nDebt/EBITDA: 5.08\n\nDebt/Cash: 24.20 \n\nInterest expenses are $500M a year due 6/1 and 12/1. \n\nFully drawn revolver at $615M @ \\~2% due 3/27/2021\n\nStrong covenants; no more debt issues; no restructuring; no sales. \n\nJust spent $165M on employee stock options; $90M on dividends.\nTotal not accounted for in figures below: - $255M cash\n\nSenior secured convertible notes $1B due 6/1/2021\n\nSenior secured convertible notes $1B due 6/1/2023\n\nSenior convertible debt $2.1B due 2/15/27\n\nSenior convertible debt $1.725B due 2/15/25\n\nJunior convertible debt $700M due 2/15/37\n\n$400M Cash 12/31\n\n$800M A/R 12/31\n\n\n$210M A/P 12/31\n\n$725M Accrued Liabilities 12/31\n\n$1.4B Current portion of long-term debt 12/31\n\nA/R > A/P; so it doesn't help them that nobody will be paying their bills on time. They'll come out net negative on it.\n\nEdit: MCHP Puts (my bad, worked on it all night) June 1st will be next big payment. Reposting so the research doesn't disappear with all the downvotes from me forgetting ticket.\n\nThey can be fucked by the new revolver contract or by a convertible debt being called in. I think there are terms on those things though, or you pay a penalty. I didn\u2019t get that far. \n\nSo TLDR: MCHP Puts June 15. Find a spot to be filled and not raped. 400M cash + 615M revolver - $165M stocks - $90M dividends = $760M. Don't count on AR and AP. $250M due June 1, 2020. $250M due Dec 1, 2020. $615M due 3/27/21. $1.25B due 6/1/21.\nI'm guessing they'll save the money and figure something out before burning literally all the cash. They can't be saved because of covenants.", "created_utc": 1585750635.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ft0lga/bankruptcy_stock_mchp/", "is_self": true}
