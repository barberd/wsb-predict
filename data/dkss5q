DD inside!", "selftext": "Allow me to educate you on Abandoned Houses and Adverse Possession Laws (in the United States):\n\nhttps://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/state-state-rules-adverse-possession.html\n\nThe law varies by State, but if you find an abandoned property, you can legally take ownership of the house as long as it is truly abandoned. The best states for this are houses where Adverse Possession only takes 5-10 years. 20 Years is way too long as far as I'm concerned and those laws should be changed anyways. But who knows, 20 years of rent-free living would be nice.\n\nHere's what you need to do to ACTUALLY be SUCCESSFUl at this:\n\n* Go through your State Tax records (publicly available or available upon request) and try and match abandoned properties with homes that are delinquent on their taxes. Some delinquent homes are still occupied, but many of these houses will be long abandoned. Also, some abandoned homes may still have an absentee owner who is paying the taxes but living somewhere else. \n\n* After you find a house, head to Home Depot. You're going to have to invest a good amount of time/money to make a house habitable. Crack \nand meth heads love to steal appliances and copper piping, so you may have to do a lot of work to get the house into a livable condition. Especially if there's mold (which you may want to get a different house entirely if that's the case)\n\n* Have a Real Estate Lawyer available for you to contact. You're going to have to do a lot of research on your own but having a lawyer will be key.\n\n* Get the utilities hooked up and get that wi-fi set up so you can run your Bloomberg Terminal with no interuptions.\n\n* Start paying the property taxes right away. First day, mail in a check and ask for a receipt to be mailed upon submission of property taxes.\n\n* Paperwork is everything! Keep track of everything and save copies to the cloud. The government only cares about MONEY, so if you can prove that you were paying property taxes this whole time then the house becomes yours. \n\n* Install a really good security system, secure windows, good doors, etc. Clean up the yard and make it look occupied.\n\n* Live rent free! This is especially good if you work from home or day trade, since you can move anywhere and thus have more options. \n\nIt might take $50k in cash to get a house like this (lawyers, taxes, improvements, etc.) but if the house used to be worth $100k+ then it's definitely worth it. And either way, you'll have no rent or mortgage, just property taxes and fixing up the house. Think about how much more you can spend on stocks if you didn't have rent/mortgage!", "created_utc": 1571619268, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dkss5q/a_free_house_means_you_can_spend_more_money_on/", "is_self": true}
