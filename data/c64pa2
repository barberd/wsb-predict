They know that everyone and their dog knows China is #2 to America with ambitions of closing that gap. \n\nI won't say China will never agree to stopping forced ip transfers or all the other ways the state's agenda are intertwined with the private sector. But I can tell you no matter what is agreed on paper, if it is viewed as punitive to China, it will not be followed to that same degree in practice.\n\nThe way to deal with the Chinese is to understand just how important face is to almost every Chinese person. A good, quick case study in relation to how PRC gov't carries it in these types of impasse situations is the [1992 Consensus](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/china-taiwan-relations) which established the \"One China\" principle. Now the kicker is both PRC China and then KMT China both agree that Taiwan is part of China, but because of how the terms of the consensus were deliberately drafted there was room for interpretation as to who is the one China, allowing both China's to save face in their agreement. The '92 Consensus would eventually amount to the de facto establishment of the PRC gov't as the one true China all the while still tacitly acknowledging Taiwan's ruling powers are strong enough to make for a costly invasion of the island, a dynamic that remains true today.\n\nIn the end, I'm hopeful Trump (but mostly the team around him) will be able to get it this time. But I'm still pretty skeptical that Trump can understand face beyond his own, let alone the sheer inertia a societal norm like face is to the Chinese. So really it's up to the Chinese to nice the guy into thinking he's winning the most which I'll bet my left nut (big one) that there's a Chinese proverb for this exact situation.\n\nThanks for readi- aw who am I kidding \n\nDD: China gonna keep hacking, US will continue to harden - long cybersecurity stocks with established US/allied gov't and big corporate stakeholders", "created_utc": 1561637121, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c64pa2/trade_talks_srs_this_time_guys/", "is_self": true}
