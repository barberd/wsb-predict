{"id": "elg6sh", "title": "TSLA will dip tomorrow (DD inside)", "selftext": "In Norway, we love electric cars.\n\nDue to our immense wealth from selling oil, we\u2019ve been subsidizing the shit out of every car you can stick a cord in. The main brand is, of course, Tesla.\n\nAnyway, today a huge fire broke out in a parking garage next to an airport in Stavanger. It\u2019s currently out of control, and they estimate ~3,000 cars can go lost. Unsubstantiated rumors suggest it was an electric vehicle catching fire that started it, and with Tesla being a disproportionate amount of the EVs sold here, there\u2019s a significant possibility it was one of their cars. If so, shorts can be looking forward to a late Christmas present with headlines like \u00abFire caused by Tesla destroys 3,000 cars!\u00bb\n\nSo the opportunity for you, my fellow retards, is to gamble that it was, in fact, a Tesla that started it and load up on some OTM puts expiring Friday. That is all.\n\n[Link to article (Norwegian)](https://www.nrk.no/rogaland/biler-i-full-fyr-i-parkeringshuset-pa-stavanger-lufthavn-1.14850087)", "created_utc": 1578424706, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/elg6sh/tsla_will_dip_tomorrow_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
