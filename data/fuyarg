Look at the facts: We have already had a huge drop, so big that there have been multiple stimulus packages passed through the government to prop up business and markets. If that wasn't enough, Jpow has got them covered with endless money anyways. Mortgages defaulting? Don't matter, BRRRRR. You lay off 90% of your employees? Don't matter, BRRRRRR and Trump has already made it clear, in only a week, that he doesn't give a fuck about any rules set in place to try to control the stimulus spending. \n\nIn a way this is good (for them, not us obviously), because it keeps the markets propped up until things can get back to normal. There is no way that the world's governments will let this virus take their power away, so they will do WHATEVER THE FUCK THEY WANT to keep that from happening. Trump talks a lot about how the solution can not be worse than the cure? Well that's 100% true. But do you think that will benefit any of you in any way? \n\nThe markets will be propped up for AS LONG AS IT TAKES, no matter what, and at any cost. Bad news? Stonks go up. Good news? Stonks go up more. 250,000 people die? The market makers are literally frothing at the mouth for that scenario, how fucking cheap will everything be for them? BTW, since the virus future death toll can be tracked with math because it follows a well known trajectory, the death toll is looking to be around 100k in the us in less than 2 weeks. \n\nSPY 9/30 $300c\n\nEDIT: 1 week ban when SP500 and DOW stay +/-3% by end of week please", "created_utc": 1586023595.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fuyarg/its_over_let_me_tell_you_why/", "is_self": true}
