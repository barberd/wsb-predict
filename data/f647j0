{"id": "f647j0", "title": "The cucklords at r/investing took this down. Enjoy.", "selftext": "TLDR: Panic selling is what stupid people do and it can be one of the costliest decisions an investor will ever make. Your short term capital gains will never, ever make up for the lost potential gains you'll suffer.\n\nI have a fairly forward-looking portfolio: The big boiz (T-MAGA), some other tech and AI, some midstream and renewables, some entertainment and streaming; and others, freckled with some biotech, dividend champion/aristocrat cushioning, and safe, old favorites (The Warren Buffett picks, mostly), and one thing I'm seeing is that stocks that are super strong are getting shaky (some of them are getting hammered) due to what I believe is panic-selling.\n\nMost successful investors (those that have not lost money) know that panic-selling is the Morgoth of money already, so if at least 80% of your portfolio is long term (as in hold or buy for at least 3 years) then you don't even need to read what I'm about to write because it's old news to you.\n\nAnyway, here's some fun, but very true facts:\n\n* Coronavirus (COVID-19)  \n\n   * has killed \\~2000 people (according to USA Today)\n   * is new and interesting (dangerous)\n   * will likely be under control before summer.\n* Orthomyxovirus (THE FUCKING ***FLU***)  \n\n   * between 12,000 \u2013 61,000 **deaths** annually since 2010 ([https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html))\n   * is constantly mutating its hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) genes (remember H1N1? that's what those letters are. )\n* The US economy  \n\n   * is stronger than it's EVER BEEN.  \n\n      * you heard God-Emperor Trumpiboi.\n      * is growing and isn't showing any signs of stopping.\n\nThat said, I'm seeing companies like T-MAGA weathering the storm as expected, at least for now. Apple opened low so I increased my position and - wouldn't you know - it went back up 3 bucks. Google is teetering but it's fucking google so it's not going anywhere. You get the picture: winners don't just magically start losing. They can, however, appear like they have magically started losing when people who run for cover every time some blowhard reporter blows a situation out of proportion start panic-selling.\n\nSo what? Who cares, right? Buy low, sell high, am I right? Well, in case anyone has been under a rock for the last couple of months, short-sellers (you know who you are) have been getting their shit packed in more violently than ever before. Why might this be? Oh yeah, because the economy is stronger than it's ever been. It's somehow super easy for people to forget that when a virus that only knocks off the very young, very elderly, and the otherwise immunocompromised takes out a near-invisibly small fraction of the population. This causes them to fear for the worst, especially after seeing such unbelievable returns, and they start having visions of their portfolio drenched in red. So they figure \"fuck it I made my money, time to get out before the world ends.\"\n\nTo be clear, I am absolutely saying that you should never, ever sell a stock. There are certainly times in the history of the economy where it's been wise to sell. A popular example nowadays is sears vs amazon. But selling positions in strong, promising companies just because \"OMG GUYS LOOK AT ALL THE RED OMGOMG CORONAVIRUS MUST BE KILLING MILLIONS\" is just dumb. These people are the sheep I'm talking about.\n\nAgain, why do I care?\n\nI care because it took me a very (very) long time to shake that mentality and come to a point where I only sold a stock under at least one of two conditions:\n\n* It's huper high (or just overvalued) and none of my best resources have given me any reason to believe it's getting higher\n* There's another stock that's super undervalued and I have very good reasons to believe it will grow.\n\nBut, before I grew up, I lost so much money in panic/short-selling that I'm embarrassed to say how much. To give you an idea, however, I will say that at one point I owned a large amount of microsoft at a cost basis of \\~30 bucks a share that I sold at 32 because I didn't really like PC's and all the people who told me AI, cloud computing, and deep learning were the \"way of the future\" were, to me, the same dumbfucks I made fun of for buying Ferrari IPO. If I had listened to those whose experience far exceeded my own and just held my investments, I'd have 6-bagged it with msft, not including the dividend. I also owned Tesla at 147 and Apple at 115 but I wont say how much because it just hurts too badly.\n\nSo now, even though it is still very hard to see my gains seemingly dissolve before my eyes, I know that if I give in to the panic someone patient and smart enough to wait will buy up the shares at a discount. Nope. Fuck that. I won't let fear cost me another dime, and neither should anyone reading this.\n\nEvery investor i've ever talked to has admitted to panic selling in the past. What separates good investors from great investors is when they learn to stop. Even Buffett has made some bad calls. Bad investors, however, never stop giving in to their impulses. I wasn't quick to the lesson, to be sure. I have been investing for 14 years. I have a bachelor's degree in fine art, a bachelor's degree in biology with a minor in chemistry, a master's degree in biomedical science, and am currently halfway through a doctorate. That's 11 years of \"higher education\" SO FAR, and it still wasn't enough to get me smart enough to just take advice from rich people. After all, that's what I want to be: rich.\n\nSo, when the market likely tanks this week, just remember there are some people that, had they taken this advice years ago, could be living debt and mortgage free with a multi-million dollar portfolio to retire them by age 40. Hint. Fucking. Hint.\n\n**Bottom line:** **Panic selling has cost me roughly 6x more money in lost potential gains than any other expense in my life, yes, even more than all the college. So just chew on that for a second. When your eyes widen and you go \"oh,** ***fuck***\\*\\*...\" just imagine how stupid I feel.", "created_utc": 1582081678, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f647j0/the_cucklords_at_rinvesting_took_this_down_enjoy/", "is_self": true}
