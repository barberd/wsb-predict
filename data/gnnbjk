The beauty of the Gordon has always been the simplicity, eat = big bull dildo. No eat = big bear dildo. So I am calling for forgiveness for myself not for Gordon because I truly believe he was trying to tell us something that I don\u2019t have the IQ to understand.

Please don\u2019t kill me and honor Gordon. \n\n[Gordon dress fancy](https://imgur.com/9cIaqdo)", "created_utc": 1590023621.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gnnbjk/i_misunderstood_gordon/", "is_self": true}
