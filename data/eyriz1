I didn\u2019t place the call tho, because I\u2019m a douche. Turns out it wouldn\u2019t have mattered tho...This AM I got up and saw $900/share and felt FOMO. Literally between sets and the gym, I placed my order. \n\nThen the market opened and my order didn\u2019t go thru because the premium immediately jumped to 3x what it was when I put the order in. So I FOMOd like a madman and tried and failed to get 4 consecutive orders to go through, having to cancel each time and pick a shittier option because the premiums are sky rocketing. It was like trying to catch an arrow mid flight, and I ain\u2019t no Robin Hood.\n\nSo I ended up, a few moments ago, going for the most retarded possible call. The only thing I could afford. It fucking expires in about 10 seconds, had a high AF premium, and is for an absurd strike which for sure ain\u2019t gonna get hit.\n\nHere\u2019s hoping stonks can only go up!", "created_utc": 1580829562, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eyriz1/lost_my_wsb_virginity_today_wish_me_luck/", "is_self": true}
