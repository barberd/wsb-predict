Thank you fucking god for that jobs report this morning.\n\nFor once, I miraculously sold the HOD.  Quickly sold the open at $2.70, $3.10 and $3.38\n\nThe puts immediately dropped in value to $1.\n\nI am back baby\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/0aomkST](https://imgur.com/a/0aomkST)\n\nEDIT:  Looks like ZM is about to dump hard and I may have left tens of thousands on the table.  The truth is, I don't care.  I sold at $3 and it went down to $1.  I didn't have to live through that.  Congrats to all ZM shorts who held on longer", "created_utc": 1591364731.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gx4uoy/7k_into_40k_this_morning_on_zm_puts_was_my_last_7k/", "is_self": true}
