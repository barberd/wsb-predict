Self checkout wouldn\u2019t scan the lettuce, so I had the gatekeeper force enter the price from the shelf.\n\nTurns out that there\u2019s a recall on lettuce from Salinas, CA that started Friday and they sold it Saturday anyway.  Walmart\u2019s system probably flagged it but the drone had no idea.  So they still sold potentially E.Coli infected lettuce even though the recall was out from the CDC the day before.\n\nHow do I make money from this?", "created_utc": 1574565185, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e0sw1w/wmt_recall_that_never_was/", "is_self": true}
