{"id": "dhe8wc", "title": "A Reality Check on Markets", "selftext": "In case you haven't noticed, just about everything is Screwed up in the economy and markets currently. There is an extreme and continually growing disconnect between economic and company performance and their market counterparts. The next year or so will be a bears wet dream. This is just a hodge-podge conglomerate of all the shit that keeps crossing my desk and what I am seeing in markets. Looking for input from retards and \"Creative Geniuses\" alike. I am in full on bear mode currently. I have stopped holding overnight for the most part and absolutely refuse to hold over weekends now. Please look at these bearish points and refute them.\n\n1. Rates are too low this late in the economic cycle. \n2. There is a severe liquidity crunch in repo markets due to the inversion of the standard balance of T-Bills and cash reserves. Banks would rather sit on reserves than take what is widely considered to be \"risk free\" returns.\n3. U.S. Equity markets are artificially inflated due to poor performance in foreign markets driving investors to flood U.S. markets and jack up prices.\n4. Junk bonds are extremely disconnected from their standard yields due to investors being starved for \"safe\" returns.\n5. Companies have over levered debt and are running debt to asset ratios above 1:1 all over the place. This is unsustainable long term.\n6. I know nobody looks at Rho, but I am seeing some interesting disproportions to standard Rho curves suggesting that rates are expected to negatively effect markets in the future. (Look at Rho for longer dated Puts on indices)\n7. There is a huge flight to safe haven assets from China currently. This is why you are seeing more and more Chinese firms and affluent / wealthy Chinese citizens purchasing real estate in the U.S., Canada, and Australia.\n8. There is increased interest in BTC relative to gold when compared to volatility, suggesting that the demand for gold and other precious metals will be so high that downward pressure from increased production will weather gold miners at a rate that the risk reward profile justifies buying BTC as a safe asset over precious metals.\n9. China has never had to struggle through an economic downturn and is not prepared to do so. People seem to forget that China is a polished turd on the face of developing economies and emerging markets. The downfall has strong potential to drag down U.S. companies that have ties to Chinese consumerism.\n10. Volatility is disagreeing with price realization in markets more and more these days.\n11. Markets have already priced in absolutely perfect execution on rate cuts and overall fiscal policy from the Fed, which at this point looks impossible.\n12. Contracting consumer sentiment and in some cases contracting consumer spending. (Such as recreational vehicles like RV sales for example)\n13. Extreme and abnormally high disagreement in public sentiment on economic and markets future outlooks.\n\nThings to watch for that will be \"nail in the coffin\" worthy for recessionary theses IMO:\n\n1. Spikes or erratic movement in commodity futures.\n2. Changes in shipping volumes (Large Truck sales already slowing btw)\n3. Negative rates in U.S.\n4. Decline in Corporate R&amp;D spending\n5. Irrational price spikes from sub phenomenal earnings over the next few quarters. I.e., if the company does anything other than beat earnings by a wide margin they should be relatively flat or dropping, not rising.\n\nPlease convince me a recession is not coming before I start doing something really stupid like shorting the crap out of LEAP Calls on indices, and exchanging my dollars for gold coated BTC. I am sitting on cash that I am waiting for the opportune time to deploy via shorting municipal and junk bond ETFs already, so I am considering adding to that reserve. As a disclosure, the bulk of my funds are dedicated to intraday trading so I am not terribly effected by a downturn or another bull run. It's one of the great things about being a day trader IMO. I will answer any questions about the points I've listed and will explain / defend my points and reasoning on anything if you ask.", "created_utc": 1570990681, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dhe8wc/a_reality_check_on_markets/", "is_self": true}
