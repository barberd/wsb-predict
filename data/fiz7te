Took my L and fucked my self off and didn't chase my losses. Also didn't see this pandemic coming. Anyway, I've been pretty much watching Ford closely, and my autistic brain is telling me to buy puts for April 24th expiration, $3 strike price.\n\nAt the moment it's .17 I wanted to buy about 100 contracts in hopes of making some $$$.  I'm pretty much VERY new to options trading, and realize how fucked it can be as I learned the hard way jumping in the market completely blind the first time. If anyone can give any insight on this trade, ill be grateful\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*edit\\* I'm basing this buy/put completely off how things are currently going with the pandemic. I bitched out on buying puts last week when it was a little less than $7 at the time, don't want to miss out this time around again ", "created_utc": 1584267072.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fiz7te/buying_puts_for_ford_a_good_idea/", "is_self": true}
