{"id": "faw3yo", "title": "IBIO = IBAE", "selftext": "Bought IBIO 18005 shares at an avg of .89 price.\n\nIBIO hit $32 during Ebola and was trading at $3 then. IBIO is a shit penny stock that flies because it owns Fastpharma - a government funded distribution vaccine company.... hence, IBIO has to be the distributor for the vaccine considering it is the ONLY company able to produce: 1) that may vaccines and 2) funded by the government\n\nTheir volume was over 150m yesterday and RIGHT now is 73m. Their volume should be over 500m and considerinig brokerages needing to fill trades, they're going to need to cover their shorts by inflating the price.\n\nThis should be a great play until about Weds/Thursday where the price is around $6-7 by then AT LEAST. It can easily hit $5 today and $7 if it moves by trend. I fucking hate penny stocks but beervirus fucking sucks too. So capitalize on buying SPY puts and buying IBIO stock\n\nTLDR: Equity in IBIO, hold 4 biz days. SPY puts.\n\n![img](35d78pnykoj41)", "created_utc": 1582902734, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/faw3yo/ibio_ibae/", "is_self": true}
