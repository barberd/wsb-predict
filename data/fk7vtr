{"id": "fk7vtr", "title": "UBER AND UBEREATS DD", "selftext": "Take a look at r/uberdrivers, they are taking a huge beating and cant find work. Ubereats will only prop it up for so long as a lot of these guys rent their vehicles and while ubereats might increase, there is a bottleneck to do so. They cant switch all drivers to ubereats and even so, most cant afford to keep up the payment on their rental car without normal ubering. \n     \n     \nmajority of the cars I get into are rentals and cost upwards of $900 a month. These guys barely make ends meet to begin with and this market is going to eliminate uber for good as well as LYFT. I take these services every single day and notice the wait time used to be like 10 minutes and now with the virus shut down, I can get a  car to my door in like 1-2 minutes. These guys are sitting WAITING for passengers and still unable to make due. \n\nJust sold 3/20 15p on LYFT and about to double down on some longer dated uber puts. These tech companies are done and honestly anyone with half a brain knows this. Lyft cant ever turn profit and its the same thing every earnings.", "created_utc": 1584461500.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fk7vtr/uber_and_ubereats_dd/", "is_self": true}
