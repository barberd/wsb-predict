After several losing days and seeing my account balance go down faster than Monica Lewinsky in the Oval Office, I was sad. I felt used. Pumped and dumped. So I wiped the cock snot off my blue dress, put on a pair of pants and figured I\u2019d try a new trick I thought of.\n\nYou can add more money to your RH account  and the balance goes up, thus erasing all losses. \n\nIf you\u2019re not following me, I tried it today and it worked. For example, my account balance went down $3,000 this week. I added $3,000 to it today and my account balance is back to where it started. Thus, my losses were erased. \n\nRinse and repeat as necessary.", "created_utc": 1566419991, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ctmpvt/robin_hood_hack/", "is_self": true}
