Go further OTM if you're crazy.**\n\n\nPLNT is a [notoriously garbage gym](https://www.t-nation.com/opinion/planet-fitness-nightmare) and has been for a long time.\n\n\nTheir [balance sheet](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PLNT/balance-sheet/) is also garbage. Their P/E ratio is 50+. \n\n\nPLNT spiked early June due to reopening news (along with everything else) and then in mid-June because 24-Hour Fitness filed [chapter 11](https://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/news/2020/06/15/24-hour-fitness-chapter-11-closes-130-cluibs.html). Was this a business opportunity for PLNT or foreshadowing? \n\n\nGyms are [fighting to reopen](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2020/06/24/u-s-appeals-court-keeps-michigan-gyms-closed-emergency-stay/3255512001/) and losing. \n\n\nThere may not be a true \"second wave\" but [daily cases are spiking](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/) and it's only a matter of time before restaurants and gyms (to the extent they were allowed to reopen) are forced to close again. PLNT doesn't have the cash to make it to 2021. Will they file chapter 7? Probably not, they have a lot of assets. They'll probably file chapter 11 sometime in 2020. PLNT is gapping down today bigly and will continue to do so until VIX drops and sentiment changes. \n\n\nLong-dated puts because they have some cash and will slowly bleed out. PLNT Aug 21 60p or 57.5p. You autists will probably want July 17 55p because they are half the price. Sell some calls if you're feeling frisky.\n\n\nOne caveat is to watch for a bailout. \n\n\nDo your own DD and don't trust a kang gang member.", "created_utc": 1593198149.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hgdpq3/plnt_is_garbage_and_so_are_you/", "is_self": true}
