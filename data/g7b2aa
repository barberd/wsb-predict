{"id": "g7b2aa", "title": "TSLA PUTS", "selftext": "Alright you mother fucking sons of bitches. TSLA is autism. Why is it going up? No fucking reason. Tesla literally only sells luxury goods, which purchases are WAY down on right now and should be down on for the foreseeable future. They\u2019re known for being strapped on cash. Papa musk himself injected a shit ton of his own money a year or two ago to keep the company afloat. If Rona hits hard enough TSLA could go so low we make billions on puts. Also, California is where their factories are located and new cases per day there has no where near peaked apparently. Look  at the fucking graphs. That shits gonna screw TESLAs factories there. Some sitting money puts they\u2019ll be. Also, what fucking dumbass is buying solar panels with oil this low. No one. You gotta be fucking retarded to buy solar panels when oil prices are so cheap. The only thing that is making TSLA go up is autism, and as we all know too well, autism always loses in the end.
