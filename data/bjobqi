My pops offered to run a screen for me in his model. I threw out five stocks that I was either looking at, or heard about from some of you lovely \"investors\" on here.\n\nI picked:\n\nNVDA\n\nTSLA\n\nSBUX\n\nTWLO\n\nMTCH\n\nand DIS.\n\nHe threw in a few of his own. Most of them failed the screen! This doesn't mean they're bad short-term / swing plays. It only means they're not the best long-term ones.\n\nThe only two to pass, which means they're recommended as strong **buy and hold plays - ACIW and NVDA.**\n\nI'm not your financial advisor, so I'm not gonna create elaborate cases for both, especially for a company like NVDA which you should already know about.\n\nACIW is a fintech stock (very similar to SQ), and they seem to have been chugging along quite well the past six months. There's another potential catalyst coming next week, so I'm planning on entering a long position before then.\n\nNVDA I might actually YOLO on earnings with. Keeping a close eye on the action in the next couple of weeks.\n\nWhen this sub is going nuts about ACIW a couple months from now, remember that you heard it here first!", "created_utc": 1556754979, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bjobqi/my_two_sixmonth_picks_aciw_and_nvda/", "is_self": true}
