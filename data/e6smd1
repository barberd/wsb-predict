(Let's get this out of the way, yes, I'm retarded.) Today it was getting dangerously close to being ITM, so I decided to buy a $4p for 0.91. If I get assigned I can sell the shares to someone else for $100 there. I'm in for $91 for the purchased put and +$10 for the sold ones. \n\nI think I just rolled the cash covered put into a debit spread, right? If PLUG drops below $3 tomorrow I'll be up $19. As far as I can tell my only risk at this point is if PLUG closes tomorrow above $3.19 which simply is *not* going to happen. \n\nMy question is, did I accidentally do a smart? Am I confused about this? Is it reasonable to expect that if a cash covered put is moving the wrong way you can turn it into a debit spread this way and make an even bigger profit? Are there hidden risks I'm not seeing?", "created_utc": 1575601677, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e6smd1/need_feedback_on_a_theta_strategy/", "is_self": true}
