{"id": "fl2xkx", "title": "New Members interested in trading", "selftext": "With the exploding success of this sub, due in part to our revolutionary market moving trades involving $MSFT, $TSLA, and lately $ROPE, there is an influx of new, young, inexperienced traders looking to learn. You might even be one of those people, wading through pages of this high brow trader speak, trying to answer for yourself some of man\u2019s most important questions:\nHow do I make a trade? What\u2019s a good brokerage? How does an option work? What is a put credit spread? What does $SPY 3/21 $250 mean? What\u2019s a bear and why do they always have a rainbow emoji? \nTo those searching for the answers, allow me to be the first to say:\n\nTHIS IS NOT THE SUB FOR YOU. \n\nNot because of our elitist attitude. Not because we\u2019re unwilling to teach. Not because of the fast paced, high volume of information exchanged in our little 1 million member corner of the internet. \n\nWe just have no fucking clue either bro lol I google \u201cinvestopedia option strategies\u201d before every trade. Good luck when in doubt deposit more funds and lie on the options upgrade questionnaire.", "created_utc": 1584587721.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fl2xkx/new_members_interested_in_trading/", "is_self": true}
