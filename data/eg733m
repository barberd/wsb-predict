Hopefully I can pick up the stock around $2-3 per share.  Naturally the sale of Xbox Series X and PS5 consoles, games, and accessories will catapult gamestop sales temporarily as there won't be many sales on new technology.  Normally, Amazon or Bestbuy would out price gamestop but not in the early adoption phase of new consoles.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy goal would be to hold Gamestop stock until the beginning of Q2 2021 as I believe Gamestop will be doing much better and can boost their stock to at least $8-10 per share.  Is this a dream or is it reasonable assuming I time my purchase right and buy near all time lows?", "created_utc": 1577425306, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eg733m/should_i_invest_in_gamestop_after_q2_2020_for_a/", "is_self": true}
