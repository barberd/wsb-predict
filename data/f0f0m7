Do *not* become the next analfarmer2.\n\nThink about it. You are set for life. You will never have to work another day in your life. All you have to do is sit on that money and watch it grow. Put that shit into a 2% savings account and collect an annual income of $160K. \n\nWhat you did is what everyone on this sub DREAMS of. I know we like to be retarded all the time and everyone says just to roll it all into MSFT weeklies, but it'd be such a disservice, not only to us, but to you as well if you lost that money. \n\nYou did what everyone comes here to see: to make truck-loads of money making full-on, go big or go home, retarded YOLO plays. Make it fucking count for something.\n\nLive the WSB dream. Live *our* dream. Live *your* dream.\n\n\nP.S. if you could PayPal me $35k so I can get back to breakeven. I learned my lesson with trading options, I promise.
