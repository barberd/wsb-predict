{"id": "e6m3l9", "title": "Shkreli said short MDCO, SAGE; long BOLD before their moves", "selftext": "This was before their most recent moves. Interesting to see him criticizing SAGE for its side effects. Here is his most recent portfolio. (Friend sent me this)\n\nShort MDCO - really hard to believe this drug will do well. The stock is up 50% since the last update, despite the lack of success of other PCSK9 and ESPRs momentum. Much better entry point here.\n\nShort 084990: My #1 short worked out, dropping 30-40%. Given the company has no assets, it is somewhat remarkable it did not drop more, but that is Korea for you.\n\nShort XON - another top short working well, down about 30%\n\nShort Telecom/Media: nothing has happened here, yet. AT&amp;T went up about 20%, VZ 5%, DIS 10% and CMCSA 5%. There is just so much content out there between social media and streaming, it s hard to fathom that monetization will continue at this unabated rate. The bashing of Marvel movies by an acclaimed director is telling. I continue to think the Internet is a huge deflationary, democratizing force that these companies are exposed to.\n\nShort ACAD - This dog has almost doubled on some fake data. Sometimes it's best to throw in the towel.\n\nShort WEED, ACB, TLRY - all of these stocks have fallen 50%. Fascinating.\n\nShort LULU - up 15% since update, still think we're in the 9th inning of this athleisure trend\n\nShort RETA - nearly doubled. i think if i wasn't in the SHU i might have not gotten run over. thankfully a 1% position.\n\nShort TSLA - up 50%. was a little uncomfortable with this one, got sucked in like an idiot.\n\nShort SAGE - working pretty well. I think the drug has bad side effects\n\nShort BA - the only stock where literally everything you could ever want as a short is happening but it doesn't go down\n\n\nLong BMRN - down about 15% in the last 6 months. very cheap in my opinion. i think hemophilia gene therapy will sell fine.\n\nLong ALXN - just about the same as BMRN, a good value, will do its thing.\n\nLong REGN - up around 10% in the last 6 months, the tide of fear is turning\n\nLong RGNX - Down 30% or so. Still great value I think but worth dusting off to be sure\n\nLong RARE - probably the biggest mistake, down around 40%. the gene therapies aren't working and the rest of \nthe portfolio is basically Crysvita which is largely 4151's drug\n\nLong UBER - down about 50%. Well... that didn't go right. My theory that they have a lot of cash/investments may not be perfect since the Didi investment could be overvalued (see the rest of Softbank's portfolio).\n\nLong GSK - Up 10% without dividends, my perrenial big pharma favorite.\n\nLong BMY - Up almost 30%, really nice trade here for such a large cap.\n\nLong ABBV - Up 20%, similar to BMY.\n\nLong BIIB - Nice and lucky with the AD news but value investing is all about 'free luck'.\n\nLong AMGN - Up around 15%.\n\nLong SGEN - nearly doubled :)\n\nLong SRPT - down 30% or so, not sure what to do there\n\nLong BOLD - thesis has not changed, stock quite a bit cheaper", "created_utc": 1575573840, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e6m3l9/shkreli_said_short_mdco_sage_long_bold_before/", "is_self": true}
