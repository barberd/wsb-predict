{"id": "dl4yyy", "title": "BA is a massive dumpster fire. You should YOLO puts! (Or should you?)", "selftext": "I've been following BA for the past four months or so, buying in and out and profit some dollars here and there, and I've been observing how the stock reacts to news regarding the 737. It has been, to say the least, volatile unpredictable and nonsensical. Read on if you are not illiterate like much of this sub.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPrior to the last earnings report, news came out with the exact figure that Boeing was going to lose with the 737 not being sold. (I can't find that exact figure). Point is, the figure was not seen to be as high as investors expected, so the BA went from the 330ish range up to 380ish over a couple days. Fast forward a day or two when earnings are released: predicted EPS was 1.85 while the real EPS was 2.92, a 57.8% surprise. Despite the incredible beat, BA proceeded to plummet down below 340.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver the next several weeks leading up to now the news cycle continued, bringing forth positive or negative news and the stock acted accordingly. This leads us to now:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith the recent reports of the FAA allegedly being lied to about the 737's progress, the stock has seen a drop from nearly 400 back down to 330. Seeing as the recent lows of bad news has not stretched beyond the depths of 320, BA is near the low of the past several months. This means that if BA performs poorly with regards to their predicted EPS than it hasn't much room to drop unless something spectacularly bad happens. It has already dropped nearly $70 dollars a share so a similar drop due to the earnings report is unlikely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the other side of the proverbial coin, if BA manages to beat the very poor expectations for them this upcoming earnings, they could move up very well. If good news regarding the FAA debacle drops at around the same time as a solid earnings report, kiss your put value goodbye.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn conclusion: there are a lot of unknowns regarding BA, particularly around this upcoming earnings report. It isn't set in stone whether calls or puts will reign in a tendie pile. Distrust any stupid idiot autists that is solid bear or bull with BA. I do not have any money in play with BA, and am instead going with less uncertain plays like V or MSFT. Good luck with your earnings plays, gentlemen (I assume there're no ladies that browse this sub)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: god damn, you skipped to the TLDR? There isn't anything here for you. Read the goddamn post, you lazy twat. If my lazy ass can write that then your lazy ass can read it. You seriously think you are going to find yourself a quality girlfriend or wife if you have to skip to the TLDR on a post this short? Fuck you.
