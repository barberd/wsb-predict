Im a college dropout working for the family business. I have no girlfriend and I live at home for the literal free tendies I get for dinner. Pretty standard stuff for the people gambling here. All I do is stream twitch to hear myself talk. Now my old man cut off two of his fingers in an industrial log splitter. He\u2019s tired and just itching to retire but can\u2019t do it because he\u2019s scared I can\u2019t run it properly. He is absolutely correct. But money talks and we can push him out. So here\u2019s the plan.\n\n1) my stream is scuffed but it can transition easily by being a collective place to lose money for the sub. Imagine a twitch plays robinhood except I take all the liability.\n\n2) I acquire enough traction to quite literally box one of the Paul brothers in the MGM arena. This serves as promotion for the sub and my name. And half the winnings go into a go fund me dedicated to the future investments for the sub. And yes I will win because retard strength is real and I imagine after losing thousands of your dollars I\u2019ll have reached maximum levels of autism.\n\n3) I take the money from streaming and boxing and buyout my manufacturing company. This is important because I can then set it up to be an officially traded IPO. Buy puts and calls accordingly after I make 10 people from the sub the board members.\n\n4) After the company fails or is wildly successful, I announce my run for Congress with the sole purpose of abolishing the SEC. If we\u2019ve made it this far we cannot lose. For we are the legion of autists that runs the people. \n\nLet me know what you think. https://www.twitch.tv/the_contender", "created_utc": 1575478299, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e62146/i_have_a_4_step_plan_to_abolish_the_sec/", "is_self": true}
