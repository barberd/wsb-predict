I did a put credit spread on MSFT with a oct. 25th expiration, sold 157.50 and bought 155. I got an email saying I\u2019ve been restricted but not as to why. I check my order details on this spread and it says I\u2019ve been assigned. What the fuck do I do? Do I only have a long put now and 15k in the hole? Earnings are tomorrow and if it pops up am I going to lose the difference from that or will Robinhood automatically exercise tomorrow morning?", "created_utc": 1571803712, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dltwsm/ive_been_assigned_and_i_need_some_legit_advice/", "is_self": true}
