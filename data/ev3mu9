If 2019-nCoV has 10x as many deaths, 1.35b / 8000 is 168k. \n\nI feel like the number is too high.\n\nThis type of numbers can be seen in other biotech stocks. \n\nI will be buying puts on VIR and other small biotech stocks that have skyrocketed. I will be avoiding puts on larger biotech stocks such as Roche and J&amp;J as they are less overpriced and are more likely to come out with actual vaccines due to their experience going through drug trials.", "created_utc": 1580205578, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ev3mu9/2019ncov_due_dilligence/", "is_self": true}
