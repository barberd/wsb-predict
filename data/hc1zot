Unfortunately I didn't read any of those because my mom measured my IQ and it is over $SPY. I mean it literally follows the trend 1to1. So I decided to invest everything in myself. I am literally eating money and shitting bricks of gold.\n\nMy brain is rising exponentially. But ass I am not selfish I try to provide my latest analysis to you. So maybe one day you have a big peepee as me! \n\nhttps://imgur.com/nQAMVkE", "created_utc": 1592578052.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hc1zot/trend_analysis/", "is_self": true}
