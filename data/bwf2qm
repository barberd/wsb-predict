{"id": "bwf2qm", "title": "Tesla will be SpaceX's first Starlink customer", "selftext": "One of the biggest problems with self-driving technology right now is the inability to get data from the vehicle back to the cloud to feed the neural network and build a better AI driver.  The more data, the more capable the AI.  Elon has estimated in the past that it would take about 6 billion miles to gather sufficient data to have a system acceptable for widespread autonomous vehicles.\n\nCurrently, only a relatively small portion of Tesla's autopilot data is sent home.  There are some interesting articles (and [threads on twitter](https://twitter.com/greentheonly/status/1096322810694287361)) about just how this system works and what data is returned to Tesla, but it's clear that data volume is a limiting factor.  The ability to process a higher volume of data, not snippets at a time, would give Tesla the ability to develop its algorithms exponentially faster than its competitors.  Starlink is the key to unlocking this.\n\nEven Tesla's critics, like Anthony Lewandowski, who had previously championed the lidar approach, have admitted that the problem is not with seeing the environment any better, it's with interpreting that environment, [and are now walking away from lidar-based solutions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgEG5rCav4).  Cars were adapted to human eyes, and the digital equivalent -- cameras -- are all that's necessary to read the surrounding environment.  The biggest hurdle right now is building the digital equivalent of a human brain, capable of understanding and interpreting that environment in real-time.\n\nNot only does Starlink allow unprecedented volumes of data collection, but it also allows for real-time data sharing between vehicles.  Your eyes can't see what's just around the corner up ahead, but the Tesla half a mile in front of you can see for you.  Ultimately this will create an autopilot that's not only safer and more robust, but one that can see farther than any single lidar-equipped vehicle ever could.\n\nFinally, with the low-latency provided by Starlink (its 20ms latency is an order of magnitude greater than the average human reaction speed), off-car processing becomes possible, with your cars autopilot instance running on a server in a Tesla datacenter, with onboard autopilot serving solely as a safety backup.\n\nHe did this before with Tesla and SolarCity.  Tesla is just one piece of the puzzle, and the farther out you go, the more his various projects converge.  The question, I suppose, is whether he can keep Tesla alive long enough to see this latest fusion come to fruition.", "created_utc": 1559591314, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bwf2qm/tesla_will_be_spacexs_first_starlink_customer/", "is_self": true}
