Well seeing the same thing in my hometown. Why don\u2019t we all pool together and each scout out our local hime improvement stores and catalogue the results. Someone smarter than me can coordinate. But some important things to include would be date/time of observation, pictures, estimates of traffic (with support as to how you reached that estimate), and estimates of \u201cnormal\u201d traffic. We would want to try to have multiple people validate each other from each city and also try to hit every day of the week. I\u2019m thinking this would be along the lines of the unemployment claims estimates we were all doing but with less bullshit and speculation.\n\nObvious reason to do this is to find evidence to but calls in anticipation of earnings. And don\u2019t worry about what you think about fundamentals or what the stock price should or shouldn\u2019t be over the next six to twelve months. Doesn\u2019t matter. All that matters is if they blow earnings out of the water then there will be a short term spike in price regardless of what comes after.", "created_utc": 1588448698.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gcck68/lets_pull_a_lk_on_hd_low/", "is_self": true}
