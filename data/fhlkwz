Because their total goal for 2020 is 75. Which means that Ulta is ahead of pace for opening new stores. \n\nWell why should anyone consider Ulta? Because Ulta continues to open stores exclusively through cash flow, that\u2019s right they have $0 long term debt. \n\n\u201cAccording to Retail Dive, Ulta\u2019s long-term brick-and-mortar strategy has been decreased to between 1,500 and 1,700 total stores. The news comes as a bit of a surprise, since the beauty chain has opened 100 stores every year since 2012. But executives noted that the high performance of new stores is the reason they decided to scale back on opening additional locations, lowering the number of openings to 80 in 2019, 75 in 2020 and 70 in 2021.\u201d\n\nSources- \n\nhttps://www.pymnts.com/news/retail/2018/ulta-lowers-new-store-openings/\n\nhttps://careers.ulta.com/search/?search=New+Store&z=&t=\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ULTA/balance-sheet?p=ULTA\n\nDisclaimer- before using this DD, make sure that you do your own research, I\u2019m long ULTA, but you should do you.\n\nPosition - https://imgur.com/a/elp2kxZ\n\nCEO message about COVID-19 - https://www.ulta.com/updates/", "created_utc": 1584039821.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhlkwz/trust_in_becky_ulta/", "is_self": true}
