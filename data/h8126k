{"id": "h8126k", "title": "Trust the big boys", "selftext": "A couple of days ago i posted a \u201cDD\u201d on BA, stating that the big boys cancelled hundreds of millions worth of limit orders on BA and that could potentially be bullish for the market. We were in a clown fucking irrational bubble at the time and nothing made sense so fuck it, might as well interpret that shit as a bullish sign.\n\nNow things are different... Now things are fucking different. After that massive VIX spike.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t know, the way VIX works is by grouping the weighted price of SPX puts and calls over a certain range of strike prices, plus some other complex calculations and shit. It\u2019s more about the volatility the market expects in the month than the actual volatility. Hence why it\u2019s called the fear index. \n\n\u201cOkay, so what the fuck does that mean you faggot? Too many words.\u201d\n\nShut up and read, cumbrain. \n\nBig boys, institutional traders and others make up the vast majority of options volume. VIX = how much big boys are shitting on their pants right now. It goes up bigly when they start to hedge their positions by hammering on puts and that\u2019s why VIX generally goes up when SPY is down and is down when SPY is up, because how  the fuck would you hedge long positions by buying calls right? \n\nNow let that sink for a moment...\n\nVIX is halfway through coronavirus crash highs... And the fucking bottom was SPY $222.\n\nBig boys are now literally pooping their panties and dripping shit on the floor, more than during corona crash comparatively. They know market is fuk. They know something is coming.\n\nVIX price has been going up even during green days since June 5th. They have been preparing their asses ever since then.\n\nSo... who would you rather trust?\n\nBig boys buying one bajirillion worth of OTM puts and Jerome tranny sniffer powell literally going live and saying that the economy will take a long time to recover and that the V shaped recovery is a myth, bursting the bubble and pouring reality into investors minds, causing a massive 5% drop one day and a flopped dead cat bounce the next...\n\nOr...\n\nPermabull retards stonks only go up? \n\nI mean... Even jerome, the literal printers owner said it\u2019s over. Big boys said it\u2019s over. Then it\u2019s over. Stocks dont go up if jerome doesnt say so.\n\nSee you at the bottom.\n\nAll in $VXX Calls", "created_utc": 1592024807.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h8126k/trust_the_big_boys/", "is_self": true}
