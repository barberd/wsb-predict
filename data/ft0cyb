Come with me down the path of inescapable logic.\n\n- SPCE has never made actual monies so locking up consumers should have no real effect on their bottom line. The valuation downturn is inexplicable by the worlds leading scientists and philosophers, so a market correction must be coming soon. \n\n- Pentagon officials are developing a double secret plan to contain future outbreaks by launching infected personnel to Mars. I\u2019m super serial. \n\n- Those who want to escape the next viral outbreak will find no better place to quarantine themselves than in outter-fucking-space. Demand is at an all-time high for getting the fuck off this planet. The price will follow. \n\n- Airlines are so 2019. Spaceships are totes the future. Any virgin who doesn\u2019t want their lunch money stolen at recess by the cool kids will jump back on the rocket ship to pussyplanet. Your wife\u2019s boyfriend doesn\u2019t \u201ctake off\u201d on her face. He blasts off...like a cock rocketship. You should follow suit. \n\nThe only thing that doesn\u2019t make sense in this crazy market it why SPCE is valued so low. \n\nSPCE 35c 4/17.", "created_utc": 1585749819.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ft0cyb/spce_is_the_play_again/", "is_self": true}
