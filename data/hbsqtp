It\u2019ll clear up 10% of their debt and won\u2019t be devalued because it\u2019s not going through a central banking system. FORD, GE, MSFT, BUD are amongst those companies. Long term calls!!! 10% cleared of debt is enough to make you stupid amount of profits. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "created_utc": 1592535360.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hbsqtp/feds_buying_bonds/", "is_self": true}
