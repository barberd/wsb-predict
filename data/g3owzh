It\u2019s a term I came up for a market that has bearish fundamentals, but experiencing a bull run.\n\n\tThe two main themes of the Federal Reserve in the post 2008 Global Financial Crisis era has been namely of ultra low interest rates and volatility suppression. While necessary and done out of good intent in their inception, the unintended consequences have far eclipsed their original scope, from the rise of carry trades, cumulating now in the Fed\u2019s Franken-Bull of 2020.\nFor those of you perma-bulls questioning the basis of \u201cbearish fundamentals:\u201d If headlines such as:\n22 million jobless claims wipes out decade of gains (Bloomberg, April 16th) cannot convince you, then neither can I.\n\n\tWe will only delve on as much history as needed to construct the foundation. At the precipice of the 2008 GFC, liquidity seized, and interbank trust evaporated. The fed\u2019s immediate actions of:\n\u201cmoney-printing presses went into overdrive. A myriad of emergency funding windows were opened to enable cash to be injected into the financial system, and from virtually any and all directions. Sovereign borrowing and credit guarantees were issued left, right, and center. Direct public funding was placed into all the major American banks and many of the smaller ones\u201d This, \u201cunprecedented deployment of liquidity and direct involvement in markets played a critical role in reconnecting the wires of the market system and restoring trust (p. 48, El-Erian)\u201d contained the crisis from a wider fallout.\n\n\tThe 2008 GFC left the world with anemic growth, lacking other policy tools, and saddled with a bureaucratic government that would rather fail conventionally than succeed unconventionally, the federal reserve resorted to targeting growth with their blunt instrument. The lax monetary policy with rates approaching zero was needed to coddle corporates with a sense of stability and safety, and it was hoped that would foster investment in innovation for real long term growth. What actually transpired with cheap credit was leveraged buyouts and hostile takeovers for some, for others, it saw defensive m&a deals and buybacks. This liquidity infusion into the economy did not produce any more output, though, it did force a new wave of valuation upon participants.\n\n\tAs aforementioned, the low interest rates and liquidity infusions were intended to restart the real economy; however, Lee, Lee, and Coldiron came to argue that it actually created \u201cthe carry regime,\u201d in their book \u201cthe Rise of Carry.\u201d The author\u2019s defined carry twice as many times as there are chapters but can be summarized as volatility selling trades that involve leverage:\n\u201cIn this book we define all carry trades to share certain critical features : leverage, liquidity provision, short exposure to volatility, and a \u201csawtooth\u201d return pattern of small, steady profits punctuated by occasional large losses (p. 3, LL&C).\u201d The trades that qualify as carry trades include:\n\u201cundertaking classic currency carry positions , writing insurance or selling credit default swaps , buying higher \u2014 yielding equities or junk debt on margin , taking out buy \u2014 to \u2014 rent mortgages to finance property investments , to writing put options on equities or equity indexes or buying exchange \u2014 traded funds that do so \u2014 but that is not all . Carry trades can also include dealings such as companies issuing debt to buy back their own equity or private equity leveraged buyouts, plus a whole gamut of more complex financial strategies and financial engineering (p. 4, LLC).\u201d\nIt\u2019s worth expanding their case for leveraged buyouts: \u201cClassic carry trades use borrowed money to take positions in high \u2014 yielding assets with less liquidity . This is precisely what private equity funds that focus on leveraged buyouts do . They combine investor capital ( equity ) with debt to purchase a portfolio of companies with earnings yields above the real cost of debt (p. 78, LLC).\u201d\n\n\tHow is this related to the Fed\u2019s Franken Bull? \u201cSince selling volatility is providing leverage and providing liquidity, the most important volatility seller must by definition be the lender of last resort. With the advent of quantitative easing (QE), particularly in its open-ended form, QE3, which was announced in September 2012, the Federal Reserve became very active in providing liquidity and leverage \u2014 which is to say, effectively selling volatility in staggering amounts. QE3 saw the Fed\u2019s balance sheet balloon in size, from US$2.9 trillion in late 2012 to US$4.5 trillion by late 2014. If the Fed is seen as the greatest volatility seller, then the claim that volatility selling is extremely important to the stock market is closely related to the quite conventional claim that the Fed is extremely important to the stock market. This idea may help in understanding the well-known chart (see Figure 6.5) (p. 101, LL&C).\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s prudent to note that although the book was published in 2020, this graph only goes to 2014, R would be lower, but still would exist if plotted out to 2020. Indeed the author\u2019s acknowledge that:\n\u201cThe idea that the stock market rose so much over 2013\u20132014 purely because the Fed pumped so much money into the economy is not credible (p. 102, LL&C).\u201d Whilst attributing the true cause of the rise as: \u201cThe true reason that the US stock market rose is that the S&P 500 has become a carry trade and the Fed\u2019s QE policy represented a massive selling of volatility. The Fed became possibly the biggest carry trader of all: its balance sheet is a huge carry trade with large holdings of yielding securities, such as Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities, financed by very low-cost liabilities including zero-interest cost cash currency in circulation (p. 103, LL&C).\u201d\n\nHerbert Stein said something like, \u201cIf something cannot go on forever, it will stop.\u201d\n\n\tNow, if you believe everything that was previously said, and thereby having established a coherent link between carry trades and the dual prongs of the fed, you come to some sobering realizations; namely:\n\n* \tThe carry regime creates an illusion of liquidity\n* \tThe delusion of liquidity raises risk-of-ruin\n* \tThe manifestation of risk-of-ruin further forces future Fed interventions\n* \tWe are now in a perpetual cycle of ever increasing moral hazard.\n\t\n\tRecall how a liquidity provision is a critical feature of carry trades, therefore, we should have a net increase in liquidity right? Well, yes, markets are flooded with liquidity during periods of calm, or rather, markets are flooded with an expectation of liquidity:\u201cInterestingly, this expectation of ample liquidity runs counter to what has actually transpired when consensus views have changed and investors have sought to reposition their portfolios accordingly. In May\u2013June 2013, when Chairman Bernanke uttered that famous word \u2014 \u201ctaper\u201d \u2014 and raised questions about the Fed\u2019s continuous support for markets, many investors were unable to complete their desired transactions for even the most vanilla-type securities (p. 115, El-Erian)\u201d\n\n\tTo explain why this runs counter to expectations, also recall that another critical feature of carry trades is that by definition they involve leverage. Let\u2019s see how liquidity plays out during a volatility spike or downturn: \u201ccarry traders are often forced to close positions when prices move against them. This necessarily means selling assets that are falling in price (or buying assets that are rising in price). Thus, the dynamics of managing carry trade risks create fire-sale effects in which initial movements in prices are often substantially amplified. The expansion of carry trades always increases liquidity; the reduction or closing of carry trades leads to liquidity contraction (p. 3, LL&C).\u201d\n\nIn essence, you have loaded your trailer in the latter configuration, and everytime you hit a bump, the Fed\u2019s hand comes to intervene:\n\n\u201cThis fact leads to a pernicious feature of carry. Leverage increases the risk of ruin, and carry involves leverage. Carry drawdowns are therefore likely to involve the risk of some participants facing ruin. This means the aggregate growth of carry is likely to represent a systemic risk to the financial system. It is therefore no accident that the increased involvement of central banks as lenders of last resort has coincided with the growth of carry. They are intimately linked (p. 72, LL&C)\u201d Because there exists an risk-of-ruin, and the manifestation of which on a large scale in unacceptable to the central bank: \u201cthe markets triggers central bank action to stabilize markets, reduce volatility, and ultimately truncate losses for some carry traders who would otherwise have been bankrupted (p. 37, LL&C).\u201d We are now in the midst of a perpetually moral hazard cycle in that carry traders, having their loses truncated, and walked out of the risk-of-ruin scenario relatively unscathed, they have incentive in ever increasing their prior behavior before, knowing the central banks will rescue them once again when the time comes.\n\n\tWe circle back at the Hebert Stein quote, with full purview of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet standing at 6.37 trillion (April 14th), which is 30% of the entire 2019 US GDP of 21.73 trillion.\nChuck Prince, the former CEO of Citigroup, said: \u201cWhen the music stops, in terms of liquidity things will be complicated. But as long as the music is playing, you\u2019ve got to get up and dance. We\u2019re still dancing.\u201d\n\n\tI guess as long as the Fed keeps the music playing, we can only dance.\n\nEl-Erian, Mohamed A.. The Only Game in Town. Random House Publishing Group.
