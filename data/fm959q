{"id": "fm959q", "title": "Don't feel bad - people with more money than you are idiots as well.", "selftext": "I'm seeing many of you lost money today. This is lamentable; however, in times like these I would like to remind you that there are much bigger idiots than you. That brings us to Ronin Capital. As you may have heard Ronin Capital went through the trading version of seppuku today. The firm was unable to meet their capital requirements. As such, the CME auctioned off their assets to help them meet their obligations. To put this in perspective for some of you, that's kind of like if you came home one day to find your wife and her boyfriend listing your shit on Facebook marketplace because you lost your job and couldn't make rent anymore. Also, you are now homeless.\n\nRonin's website [looks like this now](https://ronin-capital.com). Homeless ass looking site. What I find interesting is what it *used* to look like. This was a respectable prop firm with offices on three continents. People lost their jobs today in multiple countries due to a colossal fuckup. They also described themselves as risk adverse, which some people like I guess. The \"About\" section from their now-blank website used to read:\n\n>Over time, our focus has broadened. \u00a0Ronin trades on listed exchanges in over 20 countries, in nearly every product class: equities, fixed income, commodities, currencies, options, forwards, and futures. \u00a0Much of Ronin\u2019s success derives from our superior risk management experience. \u00a0Our unique approach combines sophisticated quantitative market analysis with years of proven trading expertise, across multiple products. \u00a0\n\nSo what do risk adverse firms do?  I was curious how an 18 year old firm that weathered 2008 could go under - they had to do something stupid despite the fact that it was a prop firm whose CEO [doesn't like trading](https://i.imgur.com/WW1Qbbx.png). That brings me to their Form 4s.\n\nI would do a bit of nice timeline here for you, but I'm sure 99% of you stopped reading by now anyway. The firm wasn't all that into equities.  [https://sec.report/CIK/0001512282](https://sec.report/CIK/0001512282) Let's talk about a few of the ones they had a hand in anyway.\n\n1. AWRE - Aware, Inc. is a biometrics company. John S. Stafford, Jr. and III as Ronin Capital basically owned 20% of the company. The SEC has their first purchase on 6/30/16. Things weren't so bad at first. But as you can see [it hasn't been awesome.](https://i.imgur.com/sNBuHiY.png)\n2. XNCR - Xencor, Inc. is actually not a POS. Their pipeline [ain't too shabby.](https://www.xencor.com/pipeline/) Stafford, Jr. knew this company well because he was on their board for 18 years. He also was well compensated in this role with [millions of shares](https://i.imgur.com/GYLQALq.png). What did he do with them? Well, he played that fucking stock [like a fiddle](https://i.imgur.com/af2mVe5.png). The arrows are big sells and big buys. Here are his actual [entries and exits](https://www.insidermole.com/insider/stafford-john-s-iii/transactions/xencor-inc), it's actually pretty fucking impressive. I have no clue why Ronin is even listed on the SEC Form 4s when they appear to be all his, but whatever. I think Ronin itself owned a few shares in the past two years.\n3. TOPS - I shit you not. Ronin Capital [owned over 10% of fucking Top Ships](https://i.imgur.com/QHeuxKJ.png). Remember that one day a few years ago when everyone was jerking off to shipping companies for all of like 3 hours and $DRYS hit $100 for no fucking reason? TOPS was in that mix too. Just thought it was funny.\n\nSo anyway, the moral of the story is that an 18 year old prop firm died today. Why? Zerohedge thinks they were on the wrong side of a VIX trade, but an Indian guy I know said I that was wrong, so who knows. If they did, a really smart rich dude trusted a trader to short vol to the point that a firm with over 16B in assets went under. So don't feel too bad about yourself tiger.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hr5r9nb3byn41.jpg?width=870&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cc6c20cec2ab9e10af5fbae505e097f83b2ef1d2", "created_utc": 1584763880.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fm959q/dont_feel_bad_people_with_more_money_than_you_are/", "is_self": true}
