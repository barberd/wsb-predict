I have a feeling Q4 results will be strong off solid holiday sales, but think Coronavirus is going to run roughshot through a retailer like BABA, who lost production from shut down factories as well as distribution (from what i heard aliexpress/dhgate purchase shipments were halted to US). With the media claiming China is lying about the true impact coronavirius is having, I envision a (worse than expected) terrible forecast upcoming.  \n\nAnyone plan on having a horse in this race Thursday?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI like the put play, but does anyone think the 7% drop is far enough for corona scares?", "created_utc": 1581352183, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f1sqi3/coronavirus_and_baba_puts_for_thursdayfriday/", "is_self": true}
