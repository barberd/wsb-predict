{"id": "hb0y48", "title": "Let's talk about Historical Patterns, not TA, just Patterns of various Market Crashes vs. Our 2020 Market", "selftext": "**For starters, I originally posted DD on Takeda way back at $16.75,** and I still believe it will rise through the coming years (they're just really killing it man, CoVIg, Vyvanse, Adderall XR, Blood products line ($$$), Entyvio for Crohn's/UC ($$), Seattle Genetics partnerships for antibody conjugate therapies ($$$), Shkrelli hiking prices in the US markets on things, they have a pipeline of solid drugs and they acquired Shire giving them all those products to sell as well...they are undervalued...period...get those LEAPS).  I say this because TAK is considered my \"safe haven investment\" as it has decent dividend and I fully expect my LEAPs to be in the money in the future.\n\n**But why in the hell do I need a safe haven, if I'm bullish?**\n\n* **Because this market looks awfully toppy and the VIX just ain't going down my friends. $DXY is gaining steam, aka dollar goes up, market goes down.  That's how it works.**\n\n**Donald Trump Round 2: Fiscal Stimulus Bugaloo**\n\nIf/when (I say when) the market corrects downward soon, it will be short and swift.  Then we'll get stimulus packages left and right, devaluing the piss out of the dollar, driving up market prices.  The dude want's re-elected and his cronies want the same.  **So in order to do that and avoid a new set of protests...another Occupy Wall Street Movement, I believe they have to let this thing slide on down for a bit.  Then run it up big going into elections** by spending more and more and printing more and more to spend on infrastructure and \"**Making America Great Again**.\"\n\n**I mean what screams \"Make America Great Again\" more than printing money to invest in US manufacturing, broadband to rural areas, improved highways, etc?  Maybe bringing back coal mining? But let's be real, that sh\\*t is dead.**\n\nAnyways, I digress, the point of this is watching patterns.  Patterns exist across all life and they generally hold.  **I don't mean BS TA stuff like \"inverse head and shoulders forming, buy calls, dude!\"  Nah, not that crap.  I'm talking blatantly obvious market tops based on past market crashes.**\n\n**Let us take a look at some patterns formed during past market crashes, and some of your favorite stocks today.**\n\n* Remember, patterns hold true because Wall Street is a casino that wants to fool you and take your money.  They do it in \\~10 year cycles because people are dumb and make the same mistakes.\n* **EDIT: I believe we are trading in WARP SPEED right now.  What used to take years to form certain patterns is now only taking us months thanks to algos.**  \n   * **Remember the pattern is relative to the time scale, not the other way around!**\n\n[Market Crashes of recent - Dot Com Bubble and 2008 Financial Crisis](https://imgur.com/a/frKOR8F)\n\nNow Let's compare that to what we see now in the SP 500, QQQ, and Tesla:\n\n* [QQQ (Nasdaq) Feb 2020 - Now](https://imgur.com/a/XbQkkZP)\n* [SPY (S&P 500) Feb 2020 - Now](https://imgur.com/a/rSc5Zrr)\n* [Tesla Dec 2019 - Now](https://imgur.com/a/UjTg5Fh)\n   * If this one doesn't jump off the page at you and SCREAM \"Holy Sh\\*t Balls, they literally made Tesla a warp-speed pattern of the 2000 crash, then bounce to 2008 highs, then crash!\" then I really have no hope for you to show any true autism in your life, and wish you luck making retarded bets.\n\n**Now let me show you some super freaking obvious chart patterns that have held true and will unfold in the coming weeks.**\n\n**Here we have:**\n\n* **Feb 2020 Microsoft and Feb 2020 PENN vs. June 2020 LULU and June 2020 Nike.**\n* **This is some eerie sh\\*t is all I am saying.**\n\n**Look at the MSFT and PENN charts before our first crash and compare the shape/patterns shown to LULU and NKE in their current state:**\n\n* [MSFT Top in February 2020](https://imgur.com/a/zfqVjQF)\n* [PENN Top in February 2020](https://imgur.com/a/u3VY4q9)\n   * vs.\n* [Nike Top Forming June 2020](https://imgur.com/a/EAxTQtn)\n* [LULU Top Forming June 2020](https://imgur.com/a/W1kxhZY)\n\n**Call me crazy, call me whatever you retards want, but WHEN IT LOOKS LIKE A DUCK, WALKS LIKE A DUCK, QUACKS LIKE A DUCK, ITS A MF'ING DUCK PEOPLE!**\n\n**I am not calling for a market crash,** **I think that we see a steep fall off soon to trap retail.**\n\nThen, they paper hands their portfolio at a loss back to big money, big money is happy again. But oh no there's public outcry and Donny Pump needs the market to get re-elected!  Perfect, this is when Trump comes in with the stimulus, JPOW fires up the printers at double speed, dollar value goes to hell in a hand basket and we see SPY $420 in 2021.  You heard it hear first kids.  Best of luck.\n\n**This isn't trading advice, just pattern recognition and application of it.  THIS IS NOT TA!! There are no crayons, and I didn't pay for the nice box with the sharpener on the back, I'm cheap!**\n\n**This my friends, is PEAK autism.  Most of you are retards and will never fully understand that, but I'm ok with it.  Bring on the hate, bring on down votes.  I'll remind you I was right in a month or so from now.**\n\n[Positions (Photo)](https://imgur.com/a/pRRxHe0)\n\n* VIX 7/22 $40c\n* QQQ 7/17 $200p\n* QQQ 8/21 $200p\n* SPY 8/21 $225P\n* TSLA 7/2 $700p\n* TSLA 8/21 $420p (on RH) and $500p\n   * Also Short -1 Shares of Tesla @$985\n* NKE 7/17 $95p and $75p\n* LULU 7/17 $250p\n* ZM 7/17 $165p (lotto ticket)\n* SQ 7/17 $75p (probably a bad move, but oh well)\n* TAK 6/18/21 $30c", "created_utc": 1592430516.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hb0y48/lets_talk_about_historical_patterns_not_ta_just/", "is_self": true}
