{"id": "getque", "title": "LMAO @ LYFT CFO Giving Week-Over-Week Growth Numbers On Figures Down 75% YoY", "selftext": "So I don't have the transcript yet, but I hope I wasn't the only one listening to the Lyft CFO. Guy sounded like the biggest pumper of all time. \n\nAt one point during the call he was talking about how in April rides were up 7%. And then how this past week was up like 10%. He was saying this with so much confidence and enthusiasm as if they just broke world records. \n\nHe then proceeded to remind people that these figures we're actually week-over-week growth metrics and that they were compared to late march, where ride volume was down 75% year over year. And that they are still down 70% year over year even in the most recent week. Pure comedy. Guy sounded like a total snake oil salesman.", "created_utc": 1588802908.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/getque/lmao_lyft_cfo_giving_weekoverweek_growth_numbers/", "is_self": true}
