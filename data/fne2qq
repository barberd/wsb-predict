I know I\u2019m retarded and probably my autist brain is oversimplifying this. But there are some potential interesting ones. If they are super effective won\u2019t it start a bull run?  \n\nNow a semi retarded thought experiment. If the \ud83e\uddf8 virus disappeared tomorrow, would we still be in a recession? Like is it too late? Has Winnie the flu already popped them bubbles?  Is the virus the only reason gay bears (including me) are binging on tendies or is it one of the reasons? I heard issues with \ud83d\udee2\ufe0f or potentially Corp debt.  Are there any other structural issues have broken due to the downturn? Like was the virus the only reason or a catalyst? Are we past the point of no return?Am I making any sense?  Would appreciate your help in making me slightly less retarded!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPosting options to prevent ban.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/20pa3bwrpco41.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=88db33ca3d62dca78edfdac80869165651101d48\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fcg0dwftpco41.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3cb85c07332dd28d9da427f36917523da2e85d44\n\n Spy options can't go tits up right?
