{"id": "eer0ew", "title": "Is Tunisia a tendyfest in the making?", "selftext": "So just hear me out here. Tunisia has a economy practically entirely dependant on export and tourism both of which will suffer is there is a recession. The government is still pretty heavily involved in the economy and has a high budget deficit and a debt to gdp ratio of around 69 nice (no really) also inflation is pretty high at around 7%. The government is unpopular, divided and corrupt and there are forces that wanna overthrow democracy. \n\nSo if I\u2019m not just blowing smoke up my ass that means Tunisia is both a shitshow and shortfest waiting to happen. Its man industries will be hit hard, the government which still plays a significant role in the economy might also be hit hard. And maybe there will even be a civil war as a cherry on top. So all in all I think that when the next reccession hits MSCI Tunisia might get completely butfucked.\n\nWhat do all yall think?", "created_utc": 1577137076, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eer0ew/is_tunisia_a_tendyfest_in_the_making/", "is_self": true}
