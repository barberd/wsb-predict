{"id": "hdtst0", "title": "Deutsche Bank falling with Wirecard", "selftext": "According to Bloomberg, Markus Braun CEO of Wirecard is facing a massive margin call as Deutsche bank has issued a margin call on a 150MM Euro loan pledged by shares that have lost 72% of their value following the news that $2 billion in the company have gone missing. Braun, who holds 7% of wirecard's shares and is the company's biggest shareholder funded a 150MM euro margin loan that was secured by the value of the underlined shares. However, last week's plunge has triggered a margin call liquidation of these shares which no longer cover the full value of the loan.\n\nIn 2017, Braun - who invested tens of millions of his own funds into the firm and owned 8.7 million shares of wirecard as of June 2019 and secured the loan from Deutsche bank by pledging 4.2 million shares, just under the half of his personal shares.\n\nWhen the stock was trading above 100/share the overcollaterialization cushion was generous, giving the loan an LTV of well below 50%. However, with the stock trading at 25, there is a 50MM shortfall in the loan and DB is rushing to collect whatever it can.\n\nAll this not really material to trade with, but yall should know. What do yall think about the future of Deutsche bank ?\n\nEdit: A lot of people are assuming i am concerned about DB's future just because of this transaction. Well, its about a reputation it has built over a period of time. This is just a stepping stone, DB is always known to make bad plays and do shady shit. \n\nEdit 2: DB\u2019s net income is 67 million. The loss on this trade would be greater than twice their net income. So don\u2019t tell me ohhh it\u2019s a trillion dollar company.
