Only 80,000 infections and you've already been noticed by the world. It's alright though. Right now, you still probably haven't used all of your DNA points yet, which means you can still recover from your fuckups. For the sake of my 3/6 puts, you need to buy Genetic Hardening 1 and 2 and Drug Resistance maxed the fuck out - you need the most time you can buy. Evolve to becoming air and water borne ASAP. Now, I know getting all of the cool symptoms is very taunting. BUT ABSTAIN! ABSTAIN! You need to infect as many people, except me ofcourse, as possible. But the thing is, the WHO and CDC have caught on to you. Thus, Genetic Reshuffle is the way! After you infected a shit ton of people start investing in ability points and max out total organ failure! \n\nMy tendie basket is awaiting.", "created_utc": 1583269137, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fd1e71/genetic_reshuffle_is_the_way/", "is_self": true}
