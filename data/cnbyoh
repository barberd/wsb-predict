{"id": "cnbyoh", "title": "Pluralsight $PS, is this stock done for or massively oversold?", "selftext": "The news after their last ER sounds pretty bad. The CEO and other top executives were dumping shares right before they missed earnings. Several law firms are opening investigations into the fact that they may have made misleading financial statements and now the stock has crashed nearly 50% this past week and seems to keep going down a dollar every day. They are not turning a profit yet but neither are plenty of other companies that do well.\n\nOn the positive side they are a somewhat unique company (subscription based online IT education) with no publicly traded competitors. They have massive contracts with all the big tech companies and last year they were rated one of the best companies to work for. I previously worked for a fortune 500 tech company that had a subscription for every one of their employees.\n\nI also personally use Pluarlsight to this day and find it very resourceful and think its a great long term hold. I can't imagine it going to 0 but I don't know how much lower it could go before it finally turns around. No stock I've ever followed has had something like this happen to it.\n\nAnyone have any thoughts or opinions on this stock they wouldn't mind sharing? Is there any other stock your aware of that has had something similar happen? Did it ever recover?", "created_utc": 1565213371, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cnbyoh/pluralsight_ps_is_this_stock_done_for_or/", "is_self": true}
