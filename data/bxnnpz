We opened and I was $10k-$15k ahead JUST FROM SITTING ON PUTS OVERNIGHT!  Now it was JPOW time.  I  started yolo'ing into puts after I heard JPOW essentially saying nothing. Or so I thought. I'm buying soo fast I'm not BOTHERING to put in stop losses. Why slow down for those when the market is diving and I'm in me PRIME!! It's like printing money!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly, there's BIG GREEN DILDOS and I'm panicking! (Everybody thinks JPow agreed to cover any market fuckups with lower interest rates). BUT I can't get the TASTY platform to work, can't sell. FUCK!! THE FUCKING INTERFACE WON'T LET ME **SELL !!!.**  **I'm watching MASSIVE LOSSES IN MY PORTFOLIO!** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTried to explain it to the first help desk cuck and he was clueless. Frustrating minutes wasted trying to explain. Gave up. Tried it again myself. Precious minutes are FLYING BY...Tried the help desk again. The second guy had a brain and I gave him temp control of my computer. Found out what was wrong. A combination of me and a foible of theirs. Probably more me. Ahem.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n It's already like half an hour later. By now I'm already THOUSANDS, maybe TENS OF THOUSANDS in the hole. I'm figuring...well, how much can JPOW'S very textured reassurances matter? Turned out they did.  A lot. It was too late to sell, Unless I was willing to take 30-40% losses\n\nr\n\nTotal damage, $38 K, another $20-30K later, Still holding on to many/ Most don't expire til 6/28, 7/20, 1/20. Main lesson? ALWAYS put a stop on a position. IMMEDIATELY. Second lesson? Don't be fake and gay. The end.\n\nP.S. If you are a bear, perhaps suggest what live sacrifices I must make to return the money which is rightfully mine!  I swear to the Great Bear Jesus, I CAN CHANGE, Man!!\n\nSpeak of your losses. Show us your porn.  That we may share the burden of your loss.", "created_utc": 1559864276, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bxnnpz/painful_stories_of_losses_this_week_also_hot_loss/", "is_self": true}
