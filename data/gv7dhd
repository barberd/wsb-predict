{"id": "gv7dhd", "title": "When the looting starts, the shooting starts - real DD", "selftext": "2020 has been an absolute insane year so far; and unfortunately, not in a good way. With all the protests breaking out in every corner of the country, there is likely a high chance that the sales of guns and ammunition will skyrocket (and it's already started). And the longer these events keep happening, the more firearms industry might benefit, since both private citizens and military will be loading up. To be honest, I even started thinking that all the protests that are seemingly so well organized at the same time in every major city could be some kind of conspiracy instigated by firearms manufacturers. This would have been a great way to get a share of that dumb money that has been flooding equity markets over the last couple of months.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019ve done some DD to identify potentially profitable deals. \n\nThere are two gun manufacturers that are publicly traded U.S. companies:\u00a0American Outdoor Brands, parent of gunmaker Smith & Wesson, and\u00a0Sturm, Ruger & Co. Both are small capitalization companies.\n\n1.  American Outdoor (NASDAQ: AOBC). Market cap: $716M; 1-year return: -37%\n\n2.  Sturm, Roger (NYSE: RGR). Market cap: $988M; 1-year return: 7%\n\nThe first one can\u2019t be bought on Robinhood (such a loss. lol). Stocks of RGR literally skyrocketed yesterday and pre-market this morning. The stock is trading at $71. Up from \\~$60 on Friday. Based on RSI it\u2019s also super overbought and I can\u2019t find any solid potential level I would be making a bet on. $75 could\u2019ve been a good level, but now we\u2019re too close to it and the options are overpriced. \n\nThere is also Vista Outdoor, which is a shooting sports company, but I do like neither their financials, not the how the stock price looks like (trends, etc).\n\n3.  Vista Outdoor (NYSE: VSTO). Market cap: $863M; 1-year return: -59%\n\nFinally, there\u2019s Olin, which I think has a high potential. It\u2019s not considered a gun manufacturing company. But it does manufacture ammunition products. From Bloomberg: \u201cOlin manufactures products that include sporting ammunition, reloading components, small caliber military ammunition and industrial cartridges.\u201d And ammunition will definitely be in demand. \n\n4.  Olin (NYSE: OLN). Market cap: $6.16B; 1-year return: 45%\n\nTheir stocks are currently trading at $12.5. The options are relatively cheap. The company also seems to be almost at their all-time low. RSI is around 53 and based on MACD, the trend just turned around and we started moving up. \n\nI think we might be a couple of days late, but I don't think the boat is missed completely. $15.5 seems to be the next strong level that is definitely very reachable in the next couple of weeks. Might go to $19, if lucky. \n\n**TL;DR: OLN 15 call 6/19**", "created_utc": 1591104631.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gv7dhd/when_the_looting_starts_the_shooting_starts_real/", "is_self": true}
