{"id": "g2sagp", "title": "There is absolutely nothing irrational going on with this market", "selftext": "Contrary to what most people think, the market is never irrational in the long term. It is actually quite rational. However, it can act irrational in the short term and can be irrational longer than you can stay solvent.\n\nWhat people fail to understand is that doing simple math, none of this correction up is extraordinary. It's called reverting back to the mean. We are currently more than 30% up from the bottom which sounds like a shit ton, but we are still only a bit above 50% of the entire correction from the top.In other words, we have retraced a bit above 50% of the entire move from ATH, which is **historically and completely normal.** During the Great Depression, after the initial drop, the Dow retraced almost 50% of that move as well up before eventually breaking the lows.\n\nWhat people also are ignoring is that we have reached a level of volatility that was never before seen in the history of the entire stock market. Compare the velocity of the last drop to others. It was much, much faster than even the initial drop of the Great depression in the 30s. As such, mathematically, it's completely expected for the retracement to be much higher than people think. Also, given the fact that the downmove was swift, big players entered into massive shorts and puts. This gives the market enough freedom to use those shorts as liquidity to go up in the short term. High panic drops have always resulted in an immediate prolonged correction up or atleast a prolonged period of sideways movement, even if the market continued to go down eventually. Look at history. It has always done this. A good example is the initial drop in the Great Depression as I mentioned above.\n\nNow, here's the thing. Contrary to what your impatient ass thinks, \"short term\" != days. It could mean many weeks or months. Just because your April/May/June puts are expiring worthless doesn't mean that the market is irrational. Fundamental factors will play out, just not in the time period you think it will. This is one of the reasons timing the market is insanely difficult and why most of you are getting their asses handed by options, especially short term ones.\n\nTl;DR SPY 230 September 18.", "created_utc": 1587086789.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2sagp/there_is_absolutely_nothing_irrational_going_on/", "is_self": true}
