Do you know why that is? That's right it was Ebola. Looking at the graph back then, for example DAL, the furthest down the cost went was -$15. Today, DAL is already down almost $16. I feel like this is very close to rock bottom for these airlines, maybe you can SQUEEZE a few more rotten tendies out if these puts, but I would consider switching to calls very soon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Airlines are as low as they're gunna fucking get.
