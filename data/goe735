(i think i bought and sold weeklies everyday.) \n\ni have always held calls and puts at the same time for protection. i have never bet more than 15% of my bankroll. still, i cannot stop the bleed. somehow i forgot how i made my way up. i guess it was just a fluke, after all.\n\nnow my plan is to play little - very little, basically, i am starting over. i now remember that my philosophy is always \"bet with the house money.\" i once, on a black jack table, turned $2 into $1200 in like 10 minutes. i like the number 1024. that is 2 to the 10th power.", "created_utc": 1590129514.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/goe735/my_anniversary_not_celebrating_yet/", "is_self": true}
