{"id": "egq0ri", "title": "The search for the Golden Goose", "selftext": "So, I've been working on some scripts that scores the accuracy of people's comments based on stock movements after their prediction. The goal is to find that special autist that could lead me to the promised land. He doesn't have to be perfect, but he has to be more right than wrong. Once found, I would then copy this persons moves and take the easy train to yacht world.      Surprise, I have not found this person.\n\nBUT, I have found some truly amazing comments that could have produce dump trucks of tendies. Granted, most of these are probably dumb luck and simple cases of the blind squirrel finding a nut, but they are amusing none the less. \n\nFor clarification, I'm not talking about the prediction of commonly talked about companies, like TSLA. Everyone talks about those, so someone is bound to get the right direction, big deal. I'm looking for a specific comment about a rarely talked about stock. Take this as an example. Back on October 27th, the wise old /u/Sinadins told us this about GRUB:\n\n&gt;Had to handle some bullshit with Grubhub at my job tonight. Their customer service can barely speak english and doesn't even know how to do anything you ask.  Short GRUB (srs)\n\nWith a few exceptions, no one was talking about GRUB before their 3rd quarter report. That's what makes this so special. GRUB would release their quarterly report the next day after close of trade, and the forecast wasn't good. The stock would fall over 40% in the next few days. So have we found our golden goose? I'm not sure. Looking at his comment section, this one prediction appears to be more accident than design. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also found this comment by /u/r6racer on July 9th:\n\n&gt;short CEI tomororw\n\nAgain, no one was talking about CEI, so I'm not sure what inspired this comment, but it was absolutely correct. CEI would lose 40% the next week, and another 40% the following week. I don't know the premiums for this time, but I'm sure serious tendies could have been made. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd lastly, this comment by /u/GrantBloomer on July 24 \n\n&gt;They can't afford to go to the doctor to even get diagnosed short LXRX\n\nThis one is special, because I can't find this comment anymore. The data archive at pushshift.io says this comment was real, but it doesn't show up in the thread any more. So I'm kind of curious what happened here. Either way, LXRX would release their quarterly report on July 31, and it was awful. The stock would fall over 75% in the next week. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI haven't found my golden goose yet. But I assure you, when I do, I will find a way to screw it up.", "created_utc": 1577534563, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/egq0ri/the_search_for_the_golden_goose/", "is_self": true}
