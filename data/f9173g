So, after trading my account from 1k down to 50 (added $65) and now at $500 I have decided to go full YOLO on a good setup once I found it. My moment is now. If you look at TSLA there is an ascending triangle that has been forming on the 4hr chart. If the breakout happens and the triangle isnt invalidated then TSLA should be at 1200 in no time. That said, 1180-1200 Calls March 6th/13th (the range just to be \"safe\").", "created_utc": 1582590162, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9173g/more_tsla_tendies_incoming/", "is_self": true}
