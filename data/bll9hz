{"id": "bll9hz", "title": "Thoughts on HD and LOW earnings this month?", "selftext": "We're two weeks from the big-box retailers' earnings reports, and if you're like me, you think that's the right lead time to act or pass, so I'm bringing this up today.\n\nAbout 8 months ago, I wrote a data mining project to do some big data analysis on thousands of small economic data points, and long story short, my project is showing HD is headed for a solid earnings beat, like upper 2.40s or even 2.50 EPS.  LOW is showing the consensus estimate is dead-on at mid 1.30s.  So I jumped in on HD calls today.\n\nMy project is still in its infancy, and there's a lot of error-handling and learning to be done, but I'm still putting my money where my monitor is.  So tell me what you mortals think- am I going to get a nasty surprise in 14 days, or is my little silicon friend correct? And even if it is, what'll that do to the share price?", "created_utc": 1557196544, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bll9hz/thoughts_on_hd_and_low_earnings_this_month/", "is_self": true}
