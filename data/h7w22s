{"id": "h7w22s", "title": "Fitbit Acquisition by Google DD (plays inside)", "selftext": "It\u2019s been 8 months since Google announced it was acquiring Fitbit in an all cash deal. In the M&A world, for digital economy companies, it\u2019s around this time things start to get interesting.  In the next couple months, either two things happen: the deal is approved or blocked. Here\u2019s what you need to know:\n\n**Plays**\n\nFIT 6/19 $6.5c - Australia\u2019s competition authority will make their decision on deal 6/18 (which will be 6/17 in the US). [Rod Simms statement on \u201cDigital Giants\u201d] (https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/digital-giants\u2019-buy-up-of-start-ups-poses-challenges-for-merger-laws) indicates the focus will be on whether Fitbit under Google enhances competition in the market. Since Fitbit already lost the battle to Apple, and [will be unable to compete very soon](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.fool.com/amp/investing/2020/02/28/its-now-clear-fitbit-is-in-serious-trouble-without.aspx), an approval is likely. \n\nFIT 7/31 $6.5c or 7/31 $6p - The DOJ is expected to rule on the deal [after giving it scrutiny](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.businessinsider.com/googles-fitbit-deal-more-scrutiny-from-the-justice-department-2020-4%3famp) by the end of July. Additionally, earnings are expected 7/29.  [Investors may be bullish on the financial results of their ventilator move](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2020/6/4/21280132/fitbit-flow-ventilator-coronavirus-shortage-fda-emergency-use-authorization-hospitals), but it could swing either way.\n\nFIT 8/7 $6.5p - The run up for Q1 earnings (obvious pump and dump) will probably happen again for Q2, especially with the ventilator move. If Fitbit closes above $6.80 on 7/27, BUY PUTS.\n\nFIT 11/20 $6c - Fitbit and Google agreed to close the deal by 11/1, otherwise Google will pay Fitbit $250 million. We know Google is good on their word, and has a 100% track record for closing acquisitions. This is the arbitrage play.\n\n*DD*\n\nSince the acquiring company is FAANG company, competition authorities around the world are giving the deal scrutiny which is expected. What makes this deal interest is two things: privacy and data concerns. Since Fitbit has a treasure trove of user health data, it makes sense regulators would be concerned how Google handles it. Is this a big deal? Yes and no. First of all, users have control of their data, and are under no obligation to share it with a Google. Second of all, Fitbit already protects data in accordance with the strict GPDR regulations. Lastly, competition laws do not prevent deals over privacy concerns. Data is a bigger deal IMO. Traditionally, this merger would not be considered horizontal or vertical (which would usually put it on the fast track for approval). However, Google\u2019s Verily sciences already does health data analytics, which is a market Fitbit operates in. Regulators in the US have not seriously investigated a merger from the perspective of data, so this is a wildcard for this deal. However, we do know how it will be investigated at least in the EU, given [the Apple and Shazam merger](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=b3ef6417-534e-408c-af89-1905bfd717ca). So the question is whether Fitbit\u2019s data is valuable enough, that under the control of Google, competitors would not be able to compete? This seems unlikely as a) many other wearables collect the same data and b) Fitbit\u2019s API allows anyone including Google to analyze user health data. The question that is yet to be addressed is how Google will use Fitbit\u2019s data for their own business. They have already stated it won\u2019t be used for targeted ads. This will probably be good enough for competition authorities, unless they can prove that merging Fitbit data sets with Google will give them a serious competitive advantage.\n\n**Players** \n\nAustralia ACCC - Rod Simms. Business man and economist. His opinion on Google acquisitions can be found [here](https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/digital-giants\u2019-buy-up-of-start-ups-poses-challenges-for-merger-laws). He will likely investigate the deal from a \u201cwhat\u2019s good for the market\u201d perspective. AU Competition laws are similar to the US, so we can expect similar rulings from either authority. \n\nUnited States DOJ - William Barr. Attorney General under Trump administration. [He has made investigating Google and other online platforms a \u201ctop priority.\u201d](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2019/01/15/attorney-general-nominee-william-barr-addresses-antitrust-and-tech.html) He is a wildcard, [because although he believes antitrust laws should be left alone](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2019/12/10/barr-defends-antitrust-law-as-warren-looks-to-reinvent-it.html), he also believes in unitary executive theory. In other words, his ruling may be swayed by Trump. While the deal should be a slam dunk from the perspective of US law, the politics involved make it uncertain. \n\nEuropean Union EC - Margrethe Vestager. Left wing politician. She does not like Google (or big tech), so immense scrutiny is expected. However, [she is not letting data watchdogs (regulators for big data) to participate in the review of the deal](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2020-02-25/google-fitbit-probe-is-for-me-not-data-watchdogs-vestager-says). So we can expect that she will scrutinize the competition effects of merging Fitbit and Google data sets. However, a similar investigation was brought into the Apple and Shazam deal, which was ultimately approved. \n\nThe UK CMA and Canadian Competition Bureau may also investigate the deal, but no filings have been made.\n\n**Conclusion** \n\nGoogle\u2019s recent acquisition of Looker took 9 months to close, so we can expect a similar timeline for Fitbit. Options plays need to pay attention to the important review dates. In all likelihood the deal will be approved, sometime in October. Arbitrage with stocks will likely need to hedge in order for an acceptable risk reward parity.", "created_utc": 1592005622.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h7w22s/fitbit_acquisition_by_google_dd_plays_inside/", "is_self": true}
