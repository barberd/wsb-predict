{"id": "g5rk08", "title": "New infinite margin trick", "selftext": "With CME rolling out [the ability to buy/sell oil options at negative strike prices](https://www.cmegroup.com/content/dam/cmegroup/notices/clearing/2020/04/Chadv20-171.pdf) tomorrow, there's likely going to be a new infinite margin hack in town when some broker fucks up the implementation.\n\n**Here's how to do it.** *Note that this does not constitute financial or legal advice in any way shape or form. If you do it, you are committing securities fraud.*\n\n1. Get yourself set up with a broker that will let you trade options on oil futures. ToS and IBKR do. Find one as shady as Robinhood so you know they'll screw up the implementation.\n2. Buy an oil futures contract. Pick whatever date you like. Nearer months are more liquid until you are within a week of expiry or so. Let's suppose you got June at $11/bbl.\n3. Sell a call at a negative strike. Let's say you sold a call at -$10/bbl. Then the intrinsic value of the option is $21/bbl, so you would be paid $21/bbl plus some change for the time value. You are hedged against the increase in price because you own the underlying futures contract, so this a type of covered call.\n4. See what you did there? You gave yourself a $10/bbl loan. Now repeat until you've reached your personal risk tolerance.\n5. YOLO on $SPY puts.\n\nAnd there you have it, a negative interest rate loan that you can blow on stupid options.\n\n***Once again, note that this does not constitute financial or legal advice. The described activity is an act of securities fraud.*** Now, godspeed you autists.", "created_utc": 1587516722.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5rk08/new_infinite_margin_trick/", "is_self": true}
