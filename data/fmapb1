Be ready to kill your neighbours.\n\nThe economic burden, from all causes, of seasonal influenza in the US is $11 billion. \n\n[Here is a link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29801998]https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29801998) to the abstract of the study that came to that conclusion:\n\n>RESULTS:\n>The estimated average annual total economic burden of influenza to the healthcare system and society was $11.2\u202fbillion ($6.3-$25.3\u202fbillion). Direct medical costs were estimated to be $3.2\u202fbillion ($1.5-$11.7\u202fbillion) and indirect costs $8.0\u202fbillion ($4.8-$13.6\u202fbillion). These total costs were based on the estimated average numbers of (1) ill-non medically attended patients (21.6\u202fmillion), (2) office-based outpatient visits (3.7\u202fmillion), (3) emergency department visit (0.65\u202fmillion) (4) hospitalizations (247.0 thousand), (5) deaths (36.3 thousand) and (6) days of productivity lost (20.1\u202fmillion). \n\nThe linked study refers to \"seasonal influenza\" and the CDC indicates that [the total numbers for influenza](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html]https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html) in the US are about double the seasonal numbers reported in the linked study, so let's double the dollar numbers for influenza as a whole. So $22 billion. \n\nThe federal government is talking about a trillion dollar stimulus for COVID-19. \n\nLet's ignore all of the state stimulus money.\n\nEven with stimulus, the economy will probably lose about another [2 to 6 trillion dollars](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/03/20/818906241/the-economy-is-getting-hit-hard-and-the-forecasts-are-scary) in terms of GDP if there is a lockdown. \n\nThe combined $3 to $7 trillion hit from the federal stimulus and diminishment of the economy is almost 150 to 300 times the total economic impact of influenza.\n\nWhat would the economic impact of doing business as usual have been? \n\nThe linked study says 21 million people in the US get seasonal influenza each year. The CDC says 45 million people get influenza each year. There are only 327 million people in the US.\n\nLet's assume that COVID-19 is 7 times as infectious as influenza and if we did nothing then everyone in the US was going to get it this year. That's a dumb assumption but I'm feeling dumb today.\n\nInfluenza has about 0.1% fatality rate. The linked study reports that of the 21.6 million people infected with seasonal influenza, about 36 thousand die. The CDC reports that about 60 thousand of the 45 million total die. Those numbers all corroborate. \n\nAll indications are that COVID-19 kills about 1% of the total infected. That's the IFR taken from the [best WHO data currently available.](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200219-sitrep-30-covid-19.pdf) \n\nA lot of the economic effects described in the linked study aren't related to deaths and wouldn't necessarily be proportionately increased by the same rate, but let's ignore that too and buff them by the same ratio. \n\nSo our version of COVID-19 is 7 times as infectious as influenza and 10 times as virulent. That would indicate a total expected unadjusted economic burden of:\n\n$22 billion x 7 x 10 = $1.54 trillion\n\nLet's gross up the cost of our super disease by 25% more for the additional costs due to stresses put on the medical system and society in general. \n\nThat's $1.93 trillion.\n\nIf the federal stimulus is $1 trillion, and the economic impacts will still be $2 to $6 trillion, then in order for this course of action to be justified, it would have to prevent between 150% to 350% of the total expected infections and deaths. It would have to prevent 3 times more deaths than we expect in the worst case scenario. \n\nThe assumptions we have relied on likely mean that we have overestimated the actual economic burden of doing nothing by somewhere between 2 to 50 times.\n\nI haven't seen anyone suggest that the present course of action will cure the disease and prevent every single death. So *there still will be costs to the medical system and society* for ill-non medically attended patients, office-based outpatient visits, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, deaths, and days of productivity lost (for those that still have jobs when they get sick).\n\nI can't see how the cure is better than the disease in this case. We are crippling the world economy just because China said \"Look what we did! Just shut everything down for 3 months lol!\" When has following China's advice ever been helpful?\n\nIf we did nothing, it would have been bad. \n\nDoing what we are doing is worse. We will end up paying for \"social distancing\" for the rest of our lives.\n\nSocial distancing!
