Jan 2021 $7 Put was $.60 yesterday when I made the first trade. Jan 2020 @ $6.00 strike was $.05 each contract. For 6 months out? In the money? Only 5 cents? What am I missing? Am I retarded or just lucky?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn looking at the dying company itself, it's dividend payout is $.60/yr, it's next payment of $.15 is early August, they have $9m cash on hand with a pay out of $10.1 coming up, this is all alongside same store sales dropping, revenues dropping and margins squeezing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe only explanation I can think of is the volume on this stock is too little to make any real moves?  In the next quarter I can see them announcing store closures, dividend cuts (was also hoping for that out of Gamestop and it took years for their management to smarten up) perhaps an announcement of \"decreased expectations\"? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHelp me out guys. Did I really stumble across an obvious win? Will this go tits up? There won't be a corporate acquisition with this shit company would they?", "created_utc": 1561562957, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c5r7kw/barnes_noble_dd_what_am_i_missing_here/", "is_self": true}
