Just because you make alot of posts and comments here with  **\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b**  doesnt mean you literally have to always short and buy puts.\n\nI keep seeing people saying \"the market will crash like soon or something so buy puts! **\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b** !!! \" while also having 0 dollars invested and taking 0 advantage of the current up-trend. You can simultaneously take advantage of market gains, and then shift your portfolio for an expected downtrend.\n\nCall it, bull-bear gang or some shit if you need, just stop losing all your damn money to rich fuckers on wallstreet before they start banging your wife. \n\nAlso, theres more than just calls and puts but I dont want to throw too many concepts at you retards at once. Im only saying this because I love you okay. WSB will be dead by next year if you all become homeless, so put these gang wars aside, and let yourself make some money.\n\nTL;DR \n\nSPY 200p 4/17", "created_utc": 1586556719.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fyq3ss/psa_you_guys_know_you_arent_locked_into_bear_gang/", "is_self": true}
