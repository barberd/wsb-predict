I keep reading the sad stories of my fellow retards who got mad tendies and blew them all on Coke, titties and SPY puts in May. Im trying to reconfigure my trading strategy to not end up giving BJs for NKLA puts like them. I've started selling covered calls, and selling puts on stocks I want to purchase. I'm looking for a nice stock/ETF that's not too expensive, very liquid and has a lot of IV to sell calls against. The main one I'm looking at right now is UVXY. I fancy myself as a slight gay \ud83d\udc3b and think we're still in for some hard times in the near future. \n\n With that being said, I was thinking about buying 100 shares and selling weekly calls against them for the next few months, eventually selling the shares before a vaccine is created and SPY goes to $500. \n\n How can this go tits up, outside of the classic WSB autist slogan \"sTOnkS oNLy Go uP\"? \n\nAlso any reccomendations for stocks you like selling calls against?", "created_utc": 1592892960.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/he9bdc/talk_me_out_of_buying_uvxy/", "is_self": true}
