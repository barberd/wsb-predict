{"id": "d9txnb", "title": "Visa Calls - EZ money?", "selftext": "I\u2019m up over 61% on the month and 121% in the past 3 months. I legitimately only buy visa calls and sell the next day, strictly no day trading. I just buy on the dips and keep averaging down and then sell the next day or a couple days after.\n\nVisa always bounces back to the 175-180 range. I know this is low quality DD but I believe it\u2019s better to trade what you know than a large amount of companies that you don\u2019t know shit about. It doesn\u2019t take a big brain to realize Visa is a beast with a nice moat. Bad China news comes out, buy visa calls. I buy ITM strikes roughly a month out expiration.\n\nI\u2019m being 100% serious. \u201cIt works until it doesn\u2019t\u201d sure, but better to have gains than sit on the sidelines scared of a nonexistent recession like the little cuck you are.\n\nWake the fuck up, have some balls, and ride this bull market out. Shit won\u2019t take with Trump in office, this dude is the pump n dump master. Stop being soft and trying to trade put credit spreads on blue chips and grab life by the horns you little fucker", "created_utc": 1569550746, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d9txnb/visa_calls_ez_money/", "is_self": true}
