{"id": "b7dp4i", "title": "[DD] The case for TTWO as a potential buyout candidate.", "selftext": "Disclosure: The following is speculation and I own shares of TTWO, as well as plan on buying more as a proportion of my overall wealth. Not yoloing on them.\n\nTake Two interactive is a parent company for video game publishers such as Rockstar Games and 2k, among others. The most notable intellectual property arguably being the Grand Theft Auto.\n\nWith the big boys Google, Amazon, and Apple all showing confirmed interest in getting more into the gaming space, the $800 billion market cap companies can easily put $10-15 billion down and buy this.\n\nI believe TTWO has a strong potential to be bought out because of Grand Theft Auto being the gold standard in gaming. Whenever a grand theft auto game is announced to whole world stops and the entire gaming ecosystem has their eyes on it. \n\nTTWO also has a great backlog of games they can keep re-releasing over the course of the years as different platforms emerge. People will keep buying their games for the nostalgia.\n\nDownside potential: This stock has been a piece of hot garbage lately due to the underwhelming public response to the overhyped Red Dead Redemption 2. With their usual silence strategy and shitty RDR 2 Online I believe they can keep dipping into the $75 territory and potentially lower. They will probably not announce GTA 6 until 2020-2021 with release in 2022-2023 with the way they have been taking 8-10 years to develop games lately.\n\nAlso, with free to play battle royale games like fortnite and apex legends getting popular, TTWO hasn't been able to change gears into the new generation of video game economics. Maybe this will change with Borderlands 3, but its a wait and see.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\n", "created_utc": 1553966822, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b7dp4i/dd_the_case_for_ttwo_as_a_potential_buyout/", "is_self": true}
