There is no way this is a viable meat replacement. Maybe soyboy vegans think it tastes like meat but it's nowhere close. Have you even tried it?\n\n1. mouthfeel is all wrong, it's springy and dry-ish instead of juicy and greasy\n2. taste is all wrong, it's missing umami and hot meat protein flavor and mostly tastes like salt instead\n3. smell is all wrong, it actually smells like cat food\n4. texture is all wrong, good burger should have a char on it with a soft interior\n\nThis weekend before I bought some BYND stock I did a few tests.\n\n# Dunkin Beyond breakfast sausage vs Dunkin pork sausage\n\nHad someone buy these and give them to me without telling me which was which. I could tell which one was pork as soon as I smelled it. Took a bite to confirm and it was even more obvious, and the pork one was way better. If I were hungry and someone offered me the beyond sandwich I would still eat it, but it's not good.\n\nThen I broke off a piece of each of the sausage and put it out for my dog. She sniffed both, ate the pork, licked the beyond patty, and ran off. I tried to hand feed the beyond patty to her again and she refused.\n\n# Beyond beef patty from whole foods vs ground beef from whole foods\n\nSame deal. Someone else prepared them, put them on bread with cheese, ketchup, avocado, grilled onion. This one especially smelled oddly like cat food, which was a dead giveaway. The taste was vaguely beefy, but it also tasted like it had been mixed with breadcrumbs and smashed lentils or hamburger helper or something. It was obvious from the first bite that it wasn't beef, and I guessed right immediately. With enough condiments and if I didn't smell the patty, I might mistake this for a very poor quality hamburger.\n\nSame deal with the dog. She refused to eat the beyond patty, twice.\n\nI would probably eat these if I were hungry and they were free or half the price of beef, but beef is vastly better.\n\n# Comparison vs Impossible\n\nIt's been almost two years since I had the impossible burger, so this may not be an accurate comparison. However, I remember the impossible burger being acceptable. Not good, but acceptable. It didn't smell like cat food, and it had a better texture, and it didn't remind me of lentils. \n\nAre you retards just buying BYND because Impossible is still private? Meatless meat is trendy and you can't buy impossible yet, so you settle for BYND? Because this is not a meat replacement, and we all know how big the fake-meat soyboy patty market is.
