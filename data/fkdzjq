Caveat: this is WSB and I am without doubt a retard. \n\n1) Gold calls. 20-30% strike above current price. GLD or mining ETF like GDX\n\n2) Meme puts. 20-30% strike under current price. \n\n3) June or July expiry. As long as you can afford. \n\n4) buy multiples so you can sell half. \n\n5) sell half when you hit 100% profit. \n\n6) sell other half whenever you feel. It\u2019s all profit. \n\nBeen rolling this for 3 weeks now, Gold related stuff took a shit turn, averaged down and finally making tendies now. Looks good long term. SPCE, SNAP and other puts making tendies guarenteed. \n\nI\u2019m back to my pre corona all time high. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af \n\nYMMV", "created_utc": 1584482355.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkdzjq/current_option_strategy_for_market_how_retarded/", "is_self": true}
