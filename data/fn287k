I work as a consultant advising gov strategy down under. Most of my insight is anecdotal as I deal with them and have friends across the isle. Do with this what you will. \n\nThesis: Uber is not a rideshare company (like Lift, Didi, Ola), they are purely a mobility company. While their stock price may fluctuate and take hits, this will not impact their broader outlook.\n\nDisclaimer: In short term Uber stock may be hit, but the company is not going under, and has bright fututre. This is not about CAVs and future robo taxis- this is now.\n\n+++\n\nWhat prompted me to write this is a series of posts saying Uber will suffer insurmountable losses during the downturn, puts are a safe bet. I don't think this will be the case due to the insight I have on how the company operates in Melbourne, where I work for the gov, opposite side of tha same desk.\n\n\u2661UBER is at the moment unique in MaaS (Mobility as a Service) space as it is trchnology agnostic, and mode of transport agnostic. The company's vision is literally to be the ultimate mobility solution, and this worries even players like Toyota.\n\n\u2664At the moment, plans are being developed for UberAir in Melbourne. The rich boomers are a plenty here, and the success is palpable. \n\n\u25c7UBER app will likely be THE journey planner platform. They are successfully negotiating with multiple governments on data sharing to plan journeys spanning all modes of public transpirt (train/tram/bus) in an integrated way. It is likely they will start recieving gov funding for this service... while also funneling rides to their drivers.\n\n\u2667Head of Toyota's tech lab in Australia presented to me (March2019) the company's outlook 5-10 years in a pitch for a potential RFP tender. They were bringing Mazda and another car company to the table and my colleague asked \"aren't they your big competitors?\" The guy said \"No. There are our partners.\". Then went to elabtorate \"Toyota sells more Hilux-es than others sell all models combined, they cant eat into our market share. Our true competitor is Uber. Toyota does not strive to be the best car company, but the best mobility (not transport) company. When Uber went into Eats, while also developing CAVs, platforms, and smart mobility solutions, it was apparent they were what we must look out for.\" \n\n\u2606And ofc Uber is a scam that millions of stupid drivers fall for, depreciating their cars for scraps. Wife worked in Commercial Passanger Vehicles (driver assessment), and can atest there are new idiots applying in droves. The recent economic downturn is even amplifying it.", "created_utc": 1584894098.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fn287k/uber_is_not_going_anywhere_dont_mix_them_with/", "is_self": true}
