Following this makes you worse than a bear.", "selftext": "Seriously, stay tuned if you\u2019re the kind of person who can\u2019t look away from car crashes.\n\n8 years ago, a sub called /r/thecorporation was created by The name \u201c_eternalSeptember_\u201d.\n\nThat sub has always had one post.  A simple substitution cypher that referenced a website that didn\u2019t exist.\n\nToday, that changed, and another cipher appeared.  This time by a user called \u201c_finalOctober_\u201d.   Today, also, the website came into existence.\n\n\n8 years?  Either this is the most elaborate, forward thinking larp of all time, someone is deeply fucking with us, or AI\u2019s from the future are communicating to WSB.  It\u2019s probs totally the last one.\n\nWhy am I bringing this to WSB?  Because THIS cipher includes stock tickers and dates - in the future.\n\nThe website is equally odd.  nextse7en.com references the coordinates to Wall Street and a future date. It also says \u201cincursion complete\u201d and lists a number of days.   I looked up what happened that number of days ago and it was the date a famous computer scientist who specialized in AI died.\n\nI don\u2019t know what the fuck is going on, but I\u2019m going to YOLO one of these tickers in the morning, probs IVR.  Stay tuned for the dumbest fucking thing you\u2019ve ever seen.\n\n\n\nFrom my \u201cimperfect\u201d cipher crack.\n\n\u201cPOSITIVE CORRELATION DWNG AAL IVR DIS\n\nNEGATIVE CORRELATION NWLA HTZ DUMP MGM\u201d\n\nI think the \u201cw\u201ds are \u201ck\u201ds\n\n\n\nEdit:\n\nNever in my life have I seen so many doubting comments on such an upvoted post.
