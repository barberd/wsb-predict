I hope everyone on this subreddit made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 8th, 2019.\n\n# **The week ahead: Powell\u2019s testimony could make or break the stock rally  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/05/the-week-ahead-powells-testimony-could-make-or-break-the-stock-rally.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has the opportunity to reinforce market expectations for a late July rate cut or rein them in when he speaks to Congress in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; Powell testifies before the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday and at the Senate Banking Committee Thursday, and is expected to answer questions on the economy and Fed policy.\n*****\n&gt; His testimony comes after a strong June jobs report raised questions about whether the Fed will actually cut rates this month. The U.S. economy added 224,000 jobs last month, easily topping a Dow Jones estimate of 165,000. The report sent the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield back above the key 2% level. The dollar also rallied against a basket of currencies, pressuring commodities like gold.\n*****\n&gt; The report was \u201cstronger than expected, but with an accompanying -11k in revisions the job gains were nothing to derail the Fed\u2019s anticipated cut in 26 days,\u201d Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note. The Fed next decides on rates on July 31.\n*****\n&gt; In the coming week, the market also has other places to look for clues on Fed policy, including in the Fed\u2019s minutes from its last meeting, after which it suggested it could cut rates if it needs to. Those minutes are released Wednesday afternoon. There is also important consumer price index inflation data Thursday and producer level inflation data on Friday, when PPI is reported.\n*****\n&gt; But Powell\u2019s comments to Congressional committees could clarify whether the Fed is on course to cut interest rates later this month, as widely expected.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s not clear to me the data are going to create a screaming case one way or the other. What it comes down to, is the Fed able to validate the market\u2019s dovishness here?\u201d said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpoint. \u201cThe one thing that has characterized Fed communications over the last month or six weeks is they\u2019re just not willing to commit to anything ahead of time.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Hopes for a rate cut have sent bond yields lower and supported stocks this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite hit all-time highs. The tech sector rose more than 1% to a record as well, while the communications services sector surged more than 2%.\n*****\n&gt; Economists say the markets would see a violent swing if Powell doesn\u2019t stay on track for a rate cut. The fed funds futures market is pricing in one full quarter point rate cut and a little more for July.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI personally don\u2019t see the case for an ease right now,\u201d said Stanley. \u201cDo they passively accept the market\u2019s verdict or do they push back, in that they\u2019re not fully on board with an ease right now? It would be easy to realign the market\u2019s expectations. Powell speaks next week and that would be the perfect opportunity if they were so inclined.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stanley said such a move would upset the stock market and weaken financial conditions, something the Fed would not want to do. But there is not a unanimous view about interest rate moves on the Fed either. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said this week that rates should be kept where they are for awhile. On the other hand, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard dissented at the June meeting because the Fed did not cut interest rates.\n*****\n&gt; Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, said a change in tone from Powell would be disruptive and unlikely. \u201cThere are other people trying to figure out what is the right thing to do right now, and there\u2019s no easy answer,\u201d said Swonk. \u201cJay Powell has made up his mind, and he doesn\u2019t want to be on the wrong side of a recession.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Swonk said she expects the Fed to cut interest rates by a quarter point at the end of the month. \u201cAll you need is uncertainty. You\u2019ve got that. You need inflation running low. You got that. You need wages not accelerating rapidly. You\u2019ve got that,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got all these things lining up.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Some economists expect a half point cut, but Swonk said that would be too much since the Fed does not really have a lot of ammunition, given that the fed funds rate range is 2.25 to 2.50%. \u201cThey want insurance, but they don\u2019t want to give away the house,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; Besides the Fed, investors will begin to think second quarter earnings season in the week ahead. Pepsico is a big name releasing its report Tuesday, ahead of the flood of reports from banks and others in the following week.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/jQonVtn.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/m3N3lix.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/L0bHHdi.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/CgMNsnt.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/WBvJZYZ.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mmZbnC0.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/TC7Fft0.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/D4sORiR.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for next month:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cgaHl9C.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/R4UVHfY.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/9vA8idX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/1TVLIHl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Jumbo First Half Gains Usually Continue After a Pause\n\n&gt; The market just put on its best first half performance for the Dow since 1999, the S&amp;P 500 since 1997 and NASDAQ since 2003 \u2013 and that\u2019s a pretty decent omen that market will tack on additional gains. Performance below following first-half Dow and S&amp;P 500 gains greater than 7% and NASDAQ Composite gains greater than 10% shows a solid history of gains for the second half \u2013 after a tepid market action in Q3.\n\n&gt; Modest gains of about 1% continue into July, but gains little ground during the rest of Q3, which should come as no surprise given the infamous negative history of August and September. On average the market was unable to match first half gains during the second, though the across-the-board 7+% gains over from July to December is still solid. The Dow\u2019s second half win ratio following jumbo gains like 2019 is a rather impressive 85.3% \u2013 S&amp;P\u2019s win ration is 80.0%, NAS 73.9%. Full-year gains are virtual lock.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/03798f3a59e96e715850d320de656a38/tumblr_inline_ptzkf9dPpp1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2357ff4a6353191f4a1175180f5a73b7/tumblr_inline_ptzkfk43391spdppr_500.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/35b5389f967e61f1fa8e449677e307aa/tumblr_inline_ptzkiw6g3s1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&amp;P 500 Sector Weightings: Mid-Year 2019\n\n&gt; Below is an updated snapshot of S&amp;P 500 sector weightings as of mid-year 2019. As shown, the Technology sector makes up the largest slice of the pie with a weighting of 21.48%. Health Care ranks as the second largest sector of the market at 14.20%, followed by Financials at 13.07%. The fact that technology and two service-oriented sectors making up nearly 50% of the index shows how much the US economy has shifted over the years. After the \"big three\" of Tech, Health Care, and Financials, we move down to Consumer Discretionary, Communication Services, and Industrials, which are all right around 10%. Consumer Staples has a weighting of 7.27%, and Energy is all the way down to 5.05% after years of losing share. Utilities, Real Estate, and Materials combine to add up to roughly 9% of the index, so these three sectors are basically immaterial at this point.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/weightings.png))**\n\n&gt; Below is a chart showing how much weightings changed in the first half of 2019. The Technology sector gained 1.33 percentage points while Health Care lost 1.23 percentage points, so the gap between the biggest sector (Tech) and the 2nd biggest sector (Health Care) widened by more than 2.5. Consumer Discretionary, Industrials, Real Estate, Materials, and Communication Services all gained share in the first half as well, while Energy, Financials, Consumer Staples, and Utilities all lost share along with Health Care.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/sector-weightings.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Most Heavily Shorted S&amp;P 500 Stocks\n\n&gt; Below is a list of the 29 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that have more than 10% of their share float sold short. Luxury retailer Nordstrom (JWN) currently tops the list with 22% of its float sold short. The stock is down 33.86% YTD and 55% from levels seen last November.\n\n&gt; Tax-prep company H&amp;R Block (HRB) is the second most heavily shorted stock with 20.55% of its float sold short. HRB is followed by sports retailer Under Armour (UAA), Snap-On (SNA), and Kohl's (KSS). While JWN and KSS are both down big YTD, HRB, UAA, and SNA are all up nicely on the year.\n\n&gt; There are plenty of other notables on the list, including Macy's (M), Campbell Soup (CPB), TripAdvisor (TRIP), Gap (GPS), Western Union (WU), and Foot Locker (FL), but one common characteristic among many of them is that they are retailers.\n\n&gt; On average, these stocks with 10%+ short interest as a percentage of float are up 8.5% on the year, which is well below the 17% gain that the S&amp;P 500 has seen.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/spx500.png))**\n\n&gt; Below we have input the list of heavily shorted stocks into a custom portfolio that Bespoke members can create when they're logged into our website. We've sorted the list by our algo-driven \"Trend\" and \"Timing\" scores. There are currently four stocks on the list that are in Bespoke \"uptrends\" with \"good\" timing scores -- Under Armour (UAA), Intl Flavors &amp; Fragrances (IFF), Campbell Soup (CPB), and Coty (COTY).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/high-shorts-ta.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Yield Curve Craters\n\n&gt; With the 10-year plummeting below 2% again and the 3-month yield spiking up by over 7 basis points (bps), which is its biggest one day gain since December 2017, the yield curve is cratering today. Today's 11 bps move further into inverted territory is the biggest one-day move since January 2nd (see second chart). While not back at new lows, today marks the 29th day that the curve has now been inverted. In Fedspeak news, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester (who leans hawkish but isn't a voter) just noted in a speech that she's in no hurry to cut. She argues that \"Cutting rates at this juncture could reinforce negative sentiment about a deterioration in the outlook even if this is not the baseline view, and could encourage financial imbalances given the current level of interest rates, which would be counterproductive.\"\n\n&gt; What would cause her to change her stance? \u201cIf I see a few weak job reports, further declines in manufacturing activity, indicators pointing to weaker business investment and consumption, and declines in readings of longer-term inflation expectations, I would view this as evidence that the base case is shifting to the weak-growth scenario.\u201d A few weak job reports? In other words, she is in no hurry to take any action. Keep in mind, though, that as recently as late February, Mester was still of the view that the FOMC would need to be raising rates later on this year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/070219-Yield-Curve.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Happy Birthday, And Another Record Goes Down\n\n&gt; \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for something to discuss at your barbecue while watching fireworks, be sure to mention this is now the oldest economic cycle in history at 121 months old,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. That\u2019s right, this cycle just topped the previous record of 120 months from the 1990s technology boom.\n\n&gt; Although 10 years might sound old, keep in mind that developed markets tend to have longer cycles of economic growth. \u201cIs 10 years really that old for an expansion? Maybe not, as Australia hasn\u2019t had a recession for nearly 28 years,\u201d according to Detrick. \u201cNot to mention Canada, the U.K., Spain, and Sweden, which all have had at least 15 years of growth starting in the early 1990s and ending in 2008. Going even further back we see that France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, South Korea, Ireland, and China have all had at least 15-year-plus expansions since World War II.\u201d\n\n&gt; Emerging countries tend to see more of a boom-and-bust type of cycle while more developed nations can have longer-lasting periods of growth. In fact, it\u2019s plausible that the United States could have avoided a recession in 2001 if the 9/11 attacks had not happened, which would have produced a nearly 17-year expansion. So maybe 10 years isn\u2019t so old?\n\n&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day, This Is Now The Longest Expansion Ever, shows, this is now the longest expansion ever. Additionally, over the decades as the United States turned into a developed nation, the cycles of growth tended to last longer. Thanks to the dual benefits of fiscal and monetary policy, we continue to expect this current cycle to have potentially years of growth left.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/826zZSV.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending July 5th, 2019** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 07.7.19**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUYuuW6kYVE))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in July-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$NFLX** \n&gt; * **$BA** \n&gt; * **$F** \n&gt; * **$UNH** \n&gt; * **$INTC** \n&gt; * **$T** \n&gt; * **$CLF** \n&gt; * **$BAC** \n&gt; * **$PEP** \n&gt; * **$GOOGL** \n&gt; * **$AEMD** \n&gt; * **$DAL** \n&gt; * **$JPM** \n&gt; * **$C** \n&gt; * **$SMPL** \n&gt; * **$HAL** \n&gt; * **$WFC** \n&gt; * **$IRBT** \n&gt; * **$AYI** \n&gt; * **$JNJ** \n&gt; * **$MMM** \n&gt; * **$BBBY** \n&gt; * **$YRD** \n&gt; * **$NOK** \n&gt; * **$ISCA** \n&gt; * **$CAT** \n&gt; * **$CMG** \n&gt; * **$ISRG** \n&gt; * **$KO** \n&gt; * **$MA** \n&gt; * **$LEVI** \n&gt; * **$BMY** \n&gt; * **$SLB** \n&gt; * **$INFY** \n&gt; * **$OMN** \n&gt; * **$GS**\n&gt; * **$CSX** \n&gt; * **$PGR** \n&gt; * **$UPS** \n&gt; * **$ERIC** \n&gt; * **$ABT** \n&gt; * **$AA** \n&gt; * **$CNC**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/xmzSnnx.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/NNrT29C.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/Sy9VT1Z.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 7.8.19 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ses5tRb.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 7.8.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 7.9.19 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eQP0M9U.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 7.9.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ePT21m9.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.10.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/YYKTKJK.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.10.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WwTFpZ9.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.11.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/gwEMWHy.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.11.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 7.12.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/yv5qORt.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 7.12.19 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Kraft Heinz Company $31.04 \n&gt; **Kraft Heinz Company (KHC)** is expected to report earnings at approximately 5:00 PM ET on Wednesday, July 31, 2019.
