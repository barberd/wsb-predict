{"id": "exzqpp", "title": "Coronavirus Growth Estimates 2/2", "selftext": "I have compiled some data and made estimates of the Coronavirus outbreak growth. I have used past growth data and am using the current total average growth rate to predict future growth numbers. \n\nI am pulling my data from the Johns Hopkins CSSE Interactive Map. Click [here](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) to check it out for yourself.\n\nI excluded 1/25 because of the irregular growth rate. I will be updating the data as to refine and update the \"Average Growth Rate\" used in creating the projections and I will post those updates daily. \n\nFeel free to comment with questions, concerns, criticism etc. I'd love some feedback. Take this with a grain of salt. This only factors in historical growth and does not reflect the measures being taken by world governments to curb the \"epidemic\". Then again, the model has been pretty close to the real growth rates thus far. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8elwjzexbme41.png?width=2414&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4298bcec7c507a4bf3f1eb4746ad27461d9c96da", "created_utc": 1580696490, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/exzqpp/coronavirus_growth_estimates_22/", "is_self": true}
