{"id": "foraju", "title": "TOS Converter from RH", "selftext": "For all you peeps asking if it's hard to switch from RH to something else, this post is for you.\n\nBeen trading for a little over a year (still a newbie) on RH.  After the great RH crash of 2020, I decided to switch my TOS paper trading account over to a live account.  In doing so, I figured I'd give myself time to learn it better and add 3 extra day trades per week.\n\nAfter a week or so of playing with it and looking at some online tutorials, I started trading. (Also, loading tends takes about that long..... No instant deposits here.)\n\nLet me tell you, trading on TOS is night and day different.  TOS actually TRIES TO GET YOU THE BEST PRICE.  Spreads don't consistently go against you and I've had very few moments of hate for TOS.  It really isn't that hard to trade on and as you get better and learn the platform, there are a plethora of tools for you to use that aren't available on RH.  Don't be intimedated, it really is NOT THAT HARD!\n\nSet and learn the Hot Keys and you will actually enjoy trading at your computer if you have the time. \n\nNow back to your regularly scheduled tendies.....  who am I kidding, SPY is more autistic right now than half you tards!", "created_utc": 1585146841.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/foraju/tos_converter_from_rh/", "is_self": true}
