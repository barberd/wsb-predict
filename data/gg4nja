I got burnt again and again - not just with going short this market, but also playing earnings.\u00a0\n\n\nI left a comment to someone's post talking about doing coin flips on which way to play the market. That would at least win 50% of the time. Me on the other hand - had less than 10% of the wins on my trades going to show that I am probably the most retarded gambler here.\n\n\nCan I get a \"gambling retard with a negative net worth flair please? Or\u00a0why don't you guys pick me a flair?\n\n\nHere is my last YOLO - Serious comment -\u00a0ALL YOUR PUTS ARE IN DANGER.\u00a0I bought it today 4 mins before the close and guess what already down 5% - lmfao.\u00a0\n\nSPX 2600 puts - June 19th 2020\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/Mr2fkQg", "created_utc": 1588982075.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gg4nja/one_final_yolo_before_i_dont_know_what_counting/", "is_self": true}
