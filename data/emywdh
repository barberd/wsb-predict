{"id": "emywdh", "title": "Puts before TSLA Q4 earnings report?", "selftext": "Hey y\u2019all,\n\nFirst time posting in this subreddit and first time gambling on RH. Long story short I wanna become autistic as quickly as possible and I want my first play to be a big success so I can get my confidence high enough to eventually lose everything.\n\nWith TSLA riding the hype train to almost 500 recently, I\u2019m guessing there\u2019ll be a slow decline to Q4 earnings (at the end of the month?). Again, I don\u2019t know shit but my uninformed assumption is that Elon Musk has been spending a lot of time away from his wife and kids because of his autism and that he\u2019s spending all of his money too? They\u2019ve been reinvesting like crazy so it\u2019s safe to assume they\u2019ll post losses, no? \n\nPlease help a gay idiot out.
