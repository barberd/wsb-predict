Open a spread. \n\nJust sell the same amount of contracts for the same expiry date that is 1 strike above or below the strike you own. Then you can close the entire position the next day without using up your day trades. \n\nIs this as great of an option as actually closing the position? No. But you can't complain cause you have no other choice. This is the next best thing.", "created_utc": 1582044047, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f5ujbz/guide_on_how_to_get_around_pdt_rule_for_poor/", "is_self": true}
