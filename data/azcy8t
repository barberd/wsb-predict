{"id": "azcy8t", "title": "Buy-write or Cash Secured Put Strategies", "selftext": "We have all lost a lot of money on our options trades. Mostly by buying far OTM options with high IV, only to be crushed following an ER or other event. I'm guilty, you're guilty, we're all guilty. Or we wouldn't be here. \n\nMaybe it's time we start getting on the other side of our shitty trades. Anyone here have any successful Buy-write or Cash secured Put writing strategies? Any good stocks for this right now? \n\nI've been writing calls against ROKU. Huge IV right now. Been having some good success, but I think it might be time to start writing cash secured puts at a price I wouldn't mind buying too.\n\nFor example on the ROKU trade. You could buy 100 shares and sell the $100 January Call for \\~$8.  You could use this $8 to buy 10 more shares in case ROKU takes off big in the next 9 months. Or just collect the premium. Or buy a Put for downside protection to make a collar.  \n\nAlternatively, you could sell the January $50 Put for \\~$5.50. You would put up \\~$4500 for the cash secured put. If never called away, you would make around 12% on that trade over 9 months.
