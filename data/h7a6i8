I wanted the laughs, see the Gain and Loss porn, but it eventually got to me, and now I seriously want to do options. \n\nI\u2019m not going to lie, I have been doing the boomer way of investing, but it\u2019s boring to me now, my profits don\u2019t compre to the ones I see, and Buffet is retarded. \nI want to have fun playing this mobile game while actually making some nice tendies.\n\nA little over a year ago I opened my RH account but didn\u2019t know what I was really doing and learned a bit a long the way. I did manage to fix up my portfolio when things when to shit in March but still not enough of what I would like to see. \nIt wasn\u2019t until I found you guys that I now know what I want to do. \n\nAfter today I have $1.9k in stocks and ETFs.\nI will never be my girlfriend\u2019s only boyfriend and most importantly, never see a Ford Raptor at this rate.\n\nAny serious advice with a side of WSB humor to learn options please? YouTube links, books, websites, tips, what not to do, anything please. \n\nI\u2019m just a broke university student that wants to finally have a \u201cGain\u201d posting on here and get the, \u201ccongrats now fuck off!\u201d Maybe want that a little bit more than the Raptor tbh.\n\nThank you all for coming to my Ted talk. \nI hope to hear soon from you all.", "created_utc": 1591921469.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h7a6i8/options_trading_help/", "is_self": true}
