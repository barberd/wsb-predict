{"id": "gowehb", "title": "AMD coiled up for a pop?", "selftext": "In the last month NVDA has sky rocketed from $284 to $361 (+27%), while AMD has gone from $56 to $55 and been essentially flat, even though it also had a good earnings report and is a very similar business to NVDA. I'm thinking both of these will go even higher over the next few months as their business models are booming and so well protected from coronavirus. Both AMD and NVDA earnings report presentations looked super good.\n\nI notice over the last few years these two like to play catch up with each other and bought some $57 weekly calls on AMD. Thoughts?\n\nTL;DR: AMD $57c 5/29\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[AMD vs NVDA 1 month](https://preview.redd.it/7g78iosj4f051.png?width=1511&format=png&auto=webp&s=39071961a82b3b51e4e6ff156a593a3a4403830c)", "created_utc": 1590198249.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gowehb/amd_coiled_up_for_a_pop/", "is_self": true}
