If RH wasn't such a shit platform I'd probably stay without even worrying about it sitting around 2kish. But unrealized gains amiright. \n\n  Started with MSFT calls first ones always free amiright. Well Doubled down when it hit its peak. Then got AMD and NVDA calls Tuesday and Wednesday got my account blown down to 1k last Monday. SPY puts printed me money to an unrealized 8k on Friday morning. \n\n  Tried to cash out of my most profitable puts but didnt fill *foreshadowing* \n\n  Which leads to today. If SPY dies overnight for some reason maybe I'll trade on ToS or TD but I think I'll just lurk this sub it's been an honor to be a part of the easiest times to make money and lose it all like a retard twice. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/xUOe6Hj", "created_utc": 1583182783, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fcivtk/rh_and_puts_combined_1_month_journey/", "is_self": true}
