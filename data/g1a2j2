Market overbought, banks showing a glimpse of what is coming", "selftext": "Okay so I woke up this morning expecting a debut of a leg down which I kinda got from the start of earnings seasons...\n\nMy bearish position was mainly push behind Q1 and Q2 reports because I always believed this is what will show true damage of the Rona virus the economy...\n\nSo when I look at the markets at open all was going upside and I was like fuck this is bullshit (still believe it is) \n\nThen at some point around 10:15... big bank started to tank... \n\nBAC did a double dip from 24.28 to 23.12 and went sideway...\n\nJPM did the same from 98 to 93\n\nThey all did! So yes earning are still showing the value and the way...\n\nSince they are the first to reports they give you a glimpse of what is coming... \n\nOn an other ground... the same way the market can\u2019t go down in a str8 line same apply when it goes up...\n\nEverything is sharply overbought... just take a look at a year graph... everything is crazy up...
