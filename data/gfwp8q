Breakdown DD.", "selftext": "A lot of people have written off Malls as they have been dropping like flies in stock value like many other commercial real-estate holders. But you are making a grave mistake if you think this is a write-off sector like most foolish and Robinhood-level investors.\n\n**$SPG, $MAC, $PEI, $TCO, $SKT, $CBL, $REG, $CDR, $WPG, Etc.**\n\nThe top 10 mall holding companies in America are all going to shoot back bigger than before for the following reasons, and the come back will actually be starting as early as next week:\n\n1. Among the top 10 mall holding companies, several of them had already before, or had decided to partner up on ventures during, the virus pandemic. This means that they (the big ones) are watching each others back and balancing themselves out.\n2. As other mall holding companies are worth pennies or nearing shutdown **the top 10 are buying up or attempting to close deals on buying up many of the smaller mall holding companies.** Some of which you won't easily find on search and only through some of the companies website blogs directly.\n3. This delusion that ***people will be \"scared\" to go to malls is hogwash***. The *political* hoax around the virus aside (not the virus itself), a lot of those twitter users whining and yelling at people on video that they shouldn't be outside and they are killing people in mass hysteria, or that they would take a year or more to go back out their house, aren't the majority of people. Most red states throw this out the window immediately, but even in Blue states \"so called\" many people have already been going to the few businesses that have been open in some of these malls during the peak of the scare. While it won't be everyone **a major number of people will flood back to the malls assuming that the businesses in the mall open along with the mall(They will).**\n4. Which goes into this point, businesses in the malls are desperate to open, some have closed up during the pandemic but the ones that haven't, who aren't major corps, aren't going to sit around and lose more money for fun, they are going to be opening along with the malls.\n5. Many of the top 10 (heck 15 in this case) indoor and outdoor mall/shopping center holders **recently saw jumps just on announcements of potentially opening up locations across several states.** One got an increase by just saying they would open up 2 locations by next week. This shows there's a heavy dose of hopium that thing will be recovering faster than it likely will, which means that Wall St will rally the more locations open.\n6. Large partners will work with the malls to advertise together to pull in more consumers and yes, it will work.\n7. Many people need haircuts, new shoes, clothes, suits, entertainment to distract them like games, movies, soundbars, headphones, etc. **The malls will be the FIRST in line to offer every day distractions and essentials** to the people, since the top 10 mll holding companies are ***going to open before many of your street strips will***. While also having social interaction, and a closed (or open if it's outdoor) space to \"hang out\" in and \"relax\", and that's important.\n\nBy betting against the malls you are basically doing the same as putting in $200 puts on SPY or $150 puts on DIA or QQQ. ***Doesn't make sense.***\n\nThe only \"risk\" is if you bet on smaller mall holding companies, some will make it and shoot up, others will be grabbed in the consolidation. Otherwise, it's free money pretty much 80% guarantee.\n\nLook at the news, Simon property is in the middle of a mall buyout NOW, I'm sure the others that will follow. [Not long ago many of them jumped up due to opening calls.](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/04/28/why-mall-reits-macerich-taubman-tanger-shot-higher.aspx)\n\nThere's also a lawsuit involving two of them over a local government turning back on a development deal, mall stocks are going to print gold bars. *Bookmark and save this page.*", "created_utc": 1588956532.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gfwp8q/many_of_you_guys_are_making_a_yuge_mistake_dont/", "is_self": true}
