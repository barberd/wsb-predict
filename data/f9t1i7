A story about Gay Bears and what is really going on.", "selftext": "Okay.. okay.. you want to feel better about your losses.. you want some solace.. some comfort.. maybe a little loving.. a little kissy kissy.. but you're autistic, a bit on the ugly side.. maybe just fucking awkward with a lisp.  It's okay because Ima tell you something.  You know all the **gay bears**?  You know the ones I'm talking about.. well after months of trying to time a market drop they are fucking broke.. all those but the biggest fattest most retard bears are fucking broke.  Soo just think.. all of them are watching the market collapse and not profiting a dime.. in fact they are working HVAC jobs during the daytime and the Wendy's drivethru at night dreaming of all the tendies they could make if they just had 5 dimes.. shit.. they'd probably settle for 2 bucks but nope.  They have PDTed on RH, Fidelity, Etrade, TD, Tasty and a couple others you haven't even heard about.  They have a burner phone not because they couldn't afford their Metro PCS bill but because Cap1 is after them after they maxed out their four cards and the margin office at Fidelity has been hounding them for 7 months.  Their fat girlfriend left them too.. so don't worry they ain't gettin that sweaty smelly mess anymore either.", "created_utc": 1582722929, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9t1i7/so_yall_can_feel_a_little_better_a_story_about/", "is_self": true}
