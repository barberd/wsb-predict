MSFT always goes up\n\nwe just have to make all of retail investors realize this: we need to all pull out of everything except microsoft and collectively pump MSFT\n\ncoronavirus doesn't matter. the actual state of the economy doesn't matter. the only thing that matters is the price of MSFT and extracting the tendies from its unending rise.\n\ni'm sure some short selling retarded boomer bear hedge fund manager who thinks MSFT will go down with the rest of the ship shorting MSFT with a call selling algo will print us free money.\n\nthen when the institutional investors realize whats going on and try to get in, we exercise all our calls, buy puts, dump everything, and pull out the rug from under them. then we pump SPCE.\n\nany flaws with my plan? didn't think so. sell all your positions except MSFT calls and shares and use the proceeds to buy them. apply for a bunch of balance transfer 0% APR credit cards, take out a home equity loan, sell your car, and dump it all into MSFT. \n\nthis literally cannot go tits up", "created_utc": 1581158365, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f0q09b/if_the_whole_stock_market_agrees_to_only_buy_msft/", "is_self": true}
