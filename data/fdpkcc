That conference would have given AMD an additional boost, along with their current momentum from the recent big contract with HP, in which they are to build a supercomputer for nukes. How will the cancellation affect the uptick. Tomorrow is shitty Thurs. Capital of dips and sell offs. Shitty Thurs, cousin of bad news Friday. \n\nEdit: https://ir.amd.com/events/event-details/financial-analyst-day-2020 conference to be held in Santa Clara CA.... That's precisely where they just had the state of emergency speech", "created_utc": 1583381101.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fdpkcc/confirmed_conferences_cancelled/", "is_self": true}
