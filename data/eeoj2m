Now, let us rejoice and celebrate TSLA as a vindication of our superior autism. This warms my heart. We even hit $420.69. I feel good. At least I'll feel good for a while. I can die in peace... I'm glad I get to celebrate with a bunch of fellow autists. This is perfect. This is bliss. Even when humanity disappears, we shall never be forgotten...\n\nAll hail the king\n\nHappy holidays\n\n420 4ever\n\nPeace", "created_utc": 1577126205, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eeoj2m/the_spirit_of_christmas_let_us_spread_love_around/", "is_self": true}
