{"id": "etd943", "title": "Hey y'all, I'd love to be apart of your community, but...", "selftext": "I think I might be a downy? \n\nI got (m)a(ny) question(s)--I'm trying to buy calls on SPCE 2021. I tried to set the strike price to 45, but it caps at 35? Why? Why are all the asks lower than the stock price? Wouldn't that be a put? Also, what is the limit about? Don't worry, I'm just paper trading. Looks like my potential profits and losses are infinite? Just trying to get this right. Whenever I adjust the limit the price fluctuates wildly.\n\nI get it, there are a ton of tutorials online. I watched a few. (Futures sound like a great idea, but when I looked around I couldn't bet on anything that I wanted to. So, don't really know how that works--guess the market is out of my hands on that one--or else I'd be practicing trading futures on AI, etc.) I'll check those videos out more later. For now, just answer my questions!\n\nI got a tip for your time. Invest in Xilinx--they're gonna hit big time within the next four years, especially if Andrew Yang becomes president. In fact, you might want to stick to Google if Andrew doesn't become president--at least until they start selling Waymo's cameras. I don't know how far Google is gonna go--they've lost a lot of soul and had a lot of internal conflict, and they just don't have the heartless tact that Amazon has when it comes to business--they're going to continue to pander to 'ethical guidelines'--I would not trust them unless their leadership improves. If you're looking for a long term AI investment you should settle with Microsoft--they've got a deal with OpenAI, Sam Altman and formerly Elon's company. Made some big investment into their company--if I were to bet on it, OpenAI is going to be leading on innovations, especially Artificial General Intelligence. \n\nWhy Xilinx? They're going to win the AI chip race. As their executive Victor Peng explains, training AI is only one step in the process of working AI. The other aspect is running the trained program--Xilinx aims to create flexible chips that can be used ubiquitously throughout the lifetime of an AI system--Victor Peng cites past chip races where generalized chips have won out over specialized chips. \n\nAI is set to triple in market value over the next four years. If you're not looking at AI to increase your gains, you're overlooking the biggest market set to explode in the near future. As soon as retailers and call centers realize that they can fire all their employees and replace them with AI, it's game over. Renewable energy is father away, and mining in space is probably so far away that the singularity will eclipse financial prospects. Money won't even exist by that point. I'd bet on it, but I don't have anything to gain if I'm right.\n\nAight.
