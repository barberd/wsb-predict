If you went in on that you are up 100%. Nice tendies.\n\nI bought some Tilray calls on Friday. They have ER after close. I thought about selling today but then I saw this - one large sweep for 250K. There is a bunch of other 15-50k calls. But 250k stood out to me. Someone might know what's coming. \n\nAdditionally, i think more people than ever are getting high since they aren't working. Weed sales have been spiking with stimulus payment dates too. Check it out yourself. \n\nTDLR - 5/15 8C for earnings tonight. \n\nPlay at your own risk and do not blame me if you get burned. This is a gamble.", "created_utc": 1589214975.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghr0cu/tlry_unusual_options_activity_515_8_call/", "is_self": true}
