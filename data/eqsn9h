{"id": "eqsn9h", "title": "Chinese Market Outlook", "selftext": "I am feeling bullish on Chinese companies that are shadowing U.S. company growth in China. Barring any major catastrophes in their society, their economy will continue to flourish. The middle class will expand and consumer spending will continue to increase, further cementing their country into a first-world nation.\n\nI think grabbing hold of companies like Luckin' Coffee, Alibaba and possibly NIO will reap massive rewards, especially over the next 5-10 years. \n\nObviously the major risks include the possibility of liquidation of foreign assets in these companies and/or your investment surviving some type of governmental restructuring.\n\nI'm willing to these risks for the rewards look plentiful. My strategy may include holding stock positions, but more than likely will be me attempting to profit from option strategies on the continued rise of selected stocks in the Chinese economy.\n\nWhat are your sentiments and outlooks? Are there companies already public or going public that you have your eyes on?", "created_utc": 1579413573, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eqsn9h/chinese_market_outlook/", "is_self": true}
