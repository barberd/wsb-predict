I\u2019ve got 18k riding on /ES puts expiring Wednesday. Why? Because it can\u2019t just keep going up, right? Any day now.\n\nI check futures and immediately turn hard as a rock. Scratch that, harder than a diamond. My tiny penis can poke holes through a wall to mount any TV. If you\u2019re in the NYC area and need a TV mounted, DM me.\n\nNow, at this point I can hedge some of my bets and buy some calls for cheap because both you and I know there\u2019s a 95% chance we open green. It\u2019s basically guaranteed. There is a smaller chance I get to penetrate my girlfriend than there is I make money tomorrow. Will I buy some /ES calls to easily hedge my bets and guarantee profit? \n\nNo.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause this is the way. \n\nI will become a millionaire, even if it takes me a billion to get there.\n\n/ES 2780p 4/29 /ES 2800p 4/29 TSLA 720p 5/1 SPY 285p 5/1", "created_utc": 1588041082.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9evmk/this_is_the_way/", "is_self": true}
