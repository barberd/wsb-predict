Knew tomorrow would be bloody and wanted to hold over the weekend as i expected bad news to drill it further down.\n\nLot of people say corona is priced in; I disagree.  Many major companies are starting to travel ban themselves, even within the US (both mine and the primary company I work with have sent out internal memos).  Also many friends' companies have done the same only since thurs/fri.  You won't see that shit on the news, but it is happening and more companies will follow.\n\nThen, on Saturday, they announced a 75% YOY reduction until May in international flights (somewhat expected).  And 20% capacity reduction in domestic flights for April, and 30% for May.  Argue priced in if you want, but boomers have been actively denying that corona is even a thing.  And then the O'hare situation was heavily publicized last night.\n\nAnd then....low and behold, the FED had an emergency meeting and lowered interest rates, causing futures to flip a circuit breaker during trading today.  Because we now know shit is really fucked.  AND to put the proverbial cherry on top...MGM and WYNN announced today that they are closing their hotels, indefinitely (until at least 5/1 and 4/12 respectively), and CZR has cancelled all live events through 3/31.  Bet they will also close soon, as well.  Vegas alone was the 8th most popular travel destination in 2019 with over 42M visitors.  That is a lot or air travel that isn't happening.  And that is only one city.\n\nNot to mention.....the *end* results are likely to be significantly higher reductions for April and May. Most travel is business travel, and as I already said many major corporations are self-inflicting travel bans, which will likely go unreported as they are not government-enforced, nor public knowledge yet.  My primary business partner has banned interstate travel.  And believe me and everyone else here that says.....this is only the tip of the iceberg.  Just wait until the test kits finally roll out and we see tens of thousands of infected or more.  It will get worse.\n\nAAL dipped under $2 during the financial crisis of 2008 and beyond.....and many experts think that this epidemic could actually end up being significantly worse for the overall economy than the 2008 financial fuck up.  No money = no vacations, even after we get the virus under control.\n\nShit is gonna print.  Small position, but don't put all your eggs in one \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b basket, right?\n\nDon't ban me:  http://imgur.com/gallery/pMy9mlL", "created_utc": 1584326263.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjdm4i/some_autists_are_saying_aal_is_priced_in_i/", "is_self": true}
