The story involves the use of digital assets but they are actually irrelevant to the main point so please stfu about it.  \n\nOK so pre-2017 I started buying digi assets in small amounts because I thought the shit was cool.  I enjoyed how easy it was to use some Dapps and quickly found my way to gambling sites.  I rolled some dice quick like, \"Cool\" whatever.   Weeks later I find my self flipping through a copy of \"*Portfolio Management Formulas\" - Ralph Vince.*  This was strange because most of the book's contents were out of my scope of understanding.  Anyway, the book is a classic and a hardcover costs more than some of your RH acct bal.  I still haven't read it but I did stumble upon Kelly's Criterion.  Now as a degen, I already knew the Martingale betting system sucks balls.  You really need like two Brazilian dollars in the bank for it to be successful but then it still sucks.  Pure Garbage.  Kelly's Criterion on the other hand is a bit more sophisticated and I vaguely understood the concept.  Naturally I thought, \"Jesus on a communion cracker, I could use this thing to roll dice.\"  Mind you, I was drunk because I drank a lot.  What ensued was the most autistic thing I've probably ever done, financially.  \n\nI downloaded a program designed to let you write your own script and execute scripts for gambling sites via API.  Now I'm not a programmer or web designer, but I'm not an idiot either so it took me a good four hours to write some script that maybe expressed Kelly's Criterion.  You know, I declared a base bet, odds, and slapped in a decision like, if win nextbet = basebet-0.3\\*basebet  If lose.. blah .. blah .. blah inverse reciprocal\\*.6 or something like that.  I'm not fixin' to think about it so that's all probably wrong.  I rolled odds at 66%  When I finally had this shit done I ran the script and watched this sweet sweet graph just melt up.  Given my bank (100 ETH) I calculated my odds of going bust at 1 in a million.  I was pulling  a respectable $300 per day just watching this shit run.  It was awesome.  I let it all ride in the bank.  Sure as shit, only a few days later I bust.  Lost about 65% of my bank and couldn't afford the next bet.  Something like a dozen losses in a row.  \"Wake up gay boi\", I had rolled over a million dice.  This was my hard lesson of the gamblers fallacy.  Afterward I said fuck it and sold the remaining assets.  I still managed a profit somehow probably from the upward market movement.  Had I just held my assets and not gambled them away on some bullshit they would have been worth over 100K at peak valuations in 2017,  but I don't play the \"what-if\" game.  Although I do often wonder if you could do some quick maths to figure out when and how to employ a QE type strategy to your bank that may keep you marginally ahead of the betting rate/odds curve or whatever I'm just thinking out loud now.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR  The house always wins; get better at gambling.", "created_utc": 1579820653, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/et15qg/speaking_of_gambling_i_present_the_most_autistic/", "is_self": true}
