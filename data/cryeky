{"id": "cryeky", "title": "Speculative outlook on China going into 2020 Elections", "selftext": "If you are a business and want to slang your shit to the 1B+ people that get hazed daily living in China, along side the octopi tentacles they have stretched into the entire asian market, you can't just ask for permission and do business. You, more or less have to give the Chinese government the \"blueprint\" to your company along with your companies IP (the IP is the most important part, where most U.S. companies really get fucked.) Once you do, they send their hack squad after you and jack all your shit. If you refuse to give them the info they require, they just won't do business with you. It's totally fucked and China is a mega cocksucker.\n\nTrump is the first President to call out GGPing and his cronies on this garbage. As a result, China wants Trump out, so they are doing everything they can to delay Trump from really squeezing the shit out of them in the near term. Come next year when the time is right, GGPing is going to bone Trump right in the ass and do whatever it takes to fuck up the U.S. economy before the election. Once Trump is gone, they hope the next dude won't give a shit about their shady business practices because why would they want to change their rules; the same rules that have been working over the past decade and a half to boost them into a global powerhouse? They don't and they won't.\n\nTL/DR: The idea is that Trumps success is tied to the economy. Things will remain calm (albeit with no deal) until it gets close to election time. When people are paying the most attention to the economy and gearing up to vote, China will turn on the jets and give the US economy a mega painal in effort to get rid of Trump. Things will simmer down going into the holiday season so Q4 ERs don't go sour and the US maintains a GDP &gt;3 or close to it (which is really really awesome, I still can't believe Trump managed to keep that promise.)
