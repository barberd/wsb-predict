Both sides would have found a place to sign Phase 1 as soon as possible and not stall for future dates.\n\nOur stock market would have been fine without the trade deal drama. Companies have been posting record earnings, but some have lowered guidance due to uncertainties with the trade war. Our technology sector alone has been so dominant globally. This is not the same Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google, etc. than it was 10 years ago.\n\nTo think that we are due for a recession just because we haven't had one in a while is baseless. People are buying houses, cars, latest and greatest products, wants... and not just needs. New housing developments are popping up left and right. Our GDP is increasing. Our economy is fine without a trade deal.", "created_utc": 1575358776, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e5do25/trade_deal_will_never_happen_our_economy_is_fine/", "is_self": true}
