I'll spearhead the effort if we can agree on a legitimate wsb-esque idea.", "selftext": "Wsb is changing as it gets more popular. This is impossible to avoid. As more and more users flood in from the front page, from Forbes, from MarketWatch, the average level of post/comment quality is bound to decrease. This is sad, but inevitable and only reversible by mass-eliminating members, which has never been wsb's MO. To put us back on the map as a little bit more cultured **and give members who want a more serious wsb something to do besides reeee'ing about how bull/bear gang is stupid and wsb isn't what they want it to be**, I was thinking it'd be cool to crowdsource a research paper on truly absurd levels of economic theory. We would choose an idea, sign up everyone who's interested and assign them some research tasks, and collect everything in a google doc to keep it organized. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor example, I was thinking we could do a deep dive on any of the following:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- How 21st century consumer habits, globalization, and a debt-fueled economy can actually achieve 'permabull' status with the average bull markets lasting far 2x+ as long as the longest of the 20th century\n\n\\- Generational risks of the currently dirt-low bar to access high-volatility investment vehicles in adolescents (aka the long-term effects of Robinhood letting 15yo's trade on margin)\n\n\\- A mountain of phenomena surrounding the emotions behind day-trading (tbh this might be the most realistic one for us to actually collect data &amp; do studies for, even if it might not be the most interesting. something to consider.)\n\n\\- An AI to determine how likely it is that a newspaper article is written with an agenda in mind to move a ticker one way or the other (would love to code this but not really sure this would make for a good group effort)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've written a few papers in my time, albeit for computer science and not economics, but I do have an econ minor which qualifies me to be the blind guy leading the deaf folk in this dumpster fire of financial innovation. I'd be happy to consider other topics, those four were just the four most applicable-to-wsb topics I could think of.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThoughts?", "created_utc": 1560286904, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bzi4h2/wsb_should_write_an_economic_research_paper_ill/", "is_self": true}
