Decided this needed to be said. Maybe it will put it end to everyone\u2019s fussing. \n\nDear future autist,\n\nAs you will come to find out 3/4 of this sub are dumbasses, including myself. Unless you want sarcastic answers, this really isn\u2019t the best place to learn. People have been complaining about these type of posts, so probably best to avoid asking for BEGINNER help. You will probably get bitched out. There are some good threads explaining options but if you are a new you don\u2019t really need to know all that yet. \n\nI suggest you watch some youtube. \n\nFinancial Education is a pretty good channel. He utilizes value investing, which is probably what you want to start with. He also has a lot of videos explaining market terms and such. There are also plenty of different channels just begging for your click, wanting to show you how you should invest your money. All of these guys are really easy to find. Start there, then branch out on information that interests you. They will introduce a lot of different concepts. \n\nSome advice would be to get a good stock watchlist together and just observe. Figure out how the market works and behaves. You can get a general understanding of everything from the sidelines. Maybe even get a TD Ameritrade account and trade paper money, that is how smart people start. I didn\u2019t do that lol. \n\nBest of luck.", "created_utc": 1563851914, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cgn81h/read_before_you_make_a_post_asking_for_help/", "is_self": true}
