{"id": "fjcwaq", "title": "Slack ($WORK) puts", "selftext": "Yo Slack ($WORK) got hit hard this week and I kept wondering why. Since it\u2019s the form of communication for every software engineer team. And everyone is working from home so I, like most, would think their value would go up. I think I figured it out why it actually tanked even amidst the pump Friday.\n\nSo their revenue model is subscription based. Companies pay a fixed amount each month for a fixed amount of users. With the WFH situation these post couple weeks, the user activity had spiked for Slack.\n\nThis spike means Slack has to pay A LOT more than usual for servers (AWS) which means their expenses are a lot higher while their revenue stays the same. Hence dropped stock value.\n\nThis led me to think that would mean AWS value has increased but because AWS is a part of amazon, this means Amazon as a whole is effected negatively from coronavirus since they are in e-commerce, which means suppliers/distributors are effected negatively, which means airplanes/logistics are effected negatively which all comes back to oil.\n\ntl/dr; long $WORK 4/3 $15p and BP 6/19 $30c for hedge", "created_utc": 1584323190.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjcwaq/slack_work_puts/", "is_self": true}
