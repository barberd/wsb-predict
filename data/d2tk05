{"id": "d2tk05", "title": "Serious question about ACB earnings, and concern over autists:", "selftext": "Honestly, how the fuck do any of you see this stock going up?   \nSince early this year, they've said they expect positive EBITDA in Q4 2019.   \n1.  Q2 results on Feb 11, 2019\n\n2. Q3 results on May 14, 2019.\n\n3. Guidance in which they literally already fucking told us the Revenue numbers on August 6. But, more importantly, saying they're \"tracking\" towards EBITDA and \"more importantly, adjusted EBITDA\". This... does not sound good.  \n\n\nLast time they guided revenue early, it was (unbelievably, wow, who woulda guessed) in the middle of the given range.   \nThe stock has, as part of a mild sector turnaround, gained 20%+ this month. In the past, the company made expensive acquisitions and burned cash, leading to 1.2B shares outstanding. That goodwill doe.   \n\n\nSo, given we already know the fucking numbers and the market has priced this in (yes, folks, if news is released a fucking month before the ER, the stock is not gonna jump on ER date if it hits those numbers), if they're \"tracking EBIDTA\" is anything mediocre, this is going down.   \n\n\nSeriously. How do you people think a stock goes up when  PRE RELEASED information occurs, not to mention the people who's money moves stock already new this information before the official company release. Think a little.\n\nI have $6 FD's expiring friday.
