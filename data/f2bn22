{"id": "f2bn22", "title": "Should we buy CODX soon?", "selftext": "CODX announced today they they're selling some of their shares to special investors at well below NASDAQ price until the 13th to fund immediate research and technology needs. This is causing a large dip in their stock price. Before this announcement, their prices were doing very well, and they have a contract for producing kits to test for the corona virus. I have a feeling that this stock is going to rebound hard after the 13th (maybe even before).
