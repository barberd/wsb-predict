VTIQ is an acquisition company who as some of you don\u2019t fucken know has merged with NIKOLA (NASDAQ) and are working on the future of transportation. I am not going to break down the details just know that these fuckers are working on some futuristic shit that is going to blow minds and save lives. They have 14,000 pre orders valued in billions (kinda like SPCE). Currently sitting at $17.70, pumped over 11% today is up over 7% after hours. Jesus fucken Christ what more do you want. Those after hour gains alone tell you that this is gonna pump a huge green dildo come next week. Long this son of a bitch for leaps. \n\nTL; DR. Next SPCE with TSLA type tech but cheap ass contracts . \n10/16 20C", "created_utc": 1588984054.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gg56pt/vtiq_the_next_spce/", "is_self": true}
