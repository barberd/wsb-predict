Some doctors suggesting viral reactivation rather than reinfection. - Reuters April 10\n\nWHO officials looked at the evidence and suggested it as a possibillity. - CNBC April 13\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/13/who-officials-say-its-unclear-whether-recovered-coronavirus-patients-are-immune-to-second-infection.html\n\nTiger King defunded WHO for \u201ccovering up the spread of\u201d Rona - April 14\n\nIf this reactivation thing bears an iota of truth, I am expecting this to be the trigger for market crash. Imagine AIDS but you get it by breathing (Insert gay jokes here). If reactivation causes symptoms that are equally bad, imagine living with antiretrovirals (like with AIDS) forever. If that is the case, put all your money on Gilead calls (and pharma etfs). \n\nA slightly less worrisome scenario (depending on your perspective) would be loss of immunity. Two reasons. One, herd immunity thesis is over. The whole going back to work after Antibody testing us over. Antibody = Not sufficiently effective or short lived. \n\nSecond, developing a vaccine would become very hard to impossible. You did not make antibodies with the live virus with all its epitopes. Not impossible probably but definitely a LOT harder = longer to infinity time to get a vaccine.\n\nThese are edge case scenarious. The news is preliminary and \nrecent. But, IMO, this is among the most market moving news that everyone needs to have a news alert for. \n\nBack to my original thesis, there is a possibility Tiger king and WH gang are getting ahead of WHO in the possibility that they will have to discredit WHO in case any of these scenarios are true. \n\nOR, Tiger King is a spiteful idiot trying to deflect blame for his incompetence. My money is on this for now.\n\nTL; DR: Reactivation of Rona and/or renfection of Rona is the true black swan event everyone should look out for.\n\nSource: I am scientist. Above are news reports. If any preprint or published study comes along, I will update this post.\n\nEdit: Thanks to a commenter below: Reports from Beijing doctors and scientists in NY showing T-cell destruction in rona.
