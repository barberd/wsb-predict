Brilliant.   \nVegas and most of the MGM resorts opened today, with most places being booked out. Now some may think it's too late for a play, however, pre-corona, the stock was $30, currently it's sitting at $21. \n\nAccording to the article on why it jumped 10% yesterday, and another 5% today, it's opening, and other casinos have seen a 17% jump in revenue YoY. I think there is still room to grow. \n\n  \n [https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/03/why-mgm-resorts-international-stock-gained-10-toda.aspx](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/03/why-mgm-resorts-international-stock-gained-10-toda.aspx) \n\nCurrently vices are up in America.\n\n [https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-vices-alcohol-marijuana-food-23f02d5e-b82b-4944-8609-b4479af1070e.html](https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-vices-alcohol-marijuana-food-23f02d5e-b82b-4944-8609-b4479af1070e.html) \n\nNumerous investment articles had been released on how sports gamblers are turning to the stock market to feed that addiction. Well, now actual gambling is opening up again, what is stopping people from turning back to the real thing again?\n\n [https://www.ft.com/content/4be0d6d3-ccab-48df-83e4-0b726273ccac](https://www.ft.com/content/4be0d6d3-ccab-48df-83e4-0b726273ccac) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think the \"back to norm\" is happening here with MGM. And i don't think it's too late to make a play. I'm personally in 7/17 $25 calls, I think that gives enough time to see revenue growth and a return to normal. Plus they're kinda cheap still. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis autist has stayed about even overall thanks to a few lucky plays.
