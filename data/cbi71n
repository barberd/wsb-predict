{"id": "cbi71n", "title": "Apple\u2019s buying Intel (modems)", "selftext": "https://www.iam-media.com/defensive-aggregation/intel-pulls-patent-sale\n\nA few months ago, [Apple was in talks to acquire Intel\u2019s now-defunct modem division.](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/06/apple-is-in-talks-to-buy-intels-germany-based-modem-business-report-claims/) Weeks later, Intel put their IP up for auction (presumably to speed up talks with Apple). Today, news broke that Intel has entered an exclusive agreement with a buyer on their IP portfolio - my bet\u2019s on Apple.\n\nNo way Apple can build their own modem in just six years (thanks to their deal with Qualcomm). Intel\u2019s modem division alone is &gt;6000 people - just hiring 6000 people is going to take six years. Apple\u2019s acquisition of Intel\u2019s modem division would work perfectly for both companies. Intel\u2019s 4G/5G development is based out of San Diego/Munich and Apple\u2019s expanding their presence in both cities. The two companies have been working closely together on the past iPhones, and Intel is obligated to support both past and future iPhones. Apple knows if they don\u2019t pick up Intel\u2019s team, Intel\u2019s whole division will fall apart and support for previous (and upcoming iPhones) will falter. It\u2019s in the best interest of both companies for the deal to go through.\n\nMy bet is that news will break before Intel earnings on 7/25.
