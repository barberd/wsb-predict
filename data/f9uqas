{"id": "f9uqas", "title": "It's Your Fucking Money", "selftext": "If you're ever doing any kind of business IRL, whether its trading stocks or some other financial products or you're raising capital for a startup, maybe you're at the silicone dildo market or whatever...you're talking on the phone or sitting there with some technical sounding dude with a suit who sounds like he went to Harvard and he's talking about how, \"OK the commission on that trade is going to come out to dickity-two fucks and fuck you in the ass.\"\n\nJust pause for a moment, close your eyes and envision the types of people you meet on /wsb.  Look at the founder of /wsb himself, sitting there in his suit and tie on his Amazon.com profile picture, mouth agape, hasn't showered in days, you're not sure which eye to make contact with.  That fucking represents the level of sophistication of the average business person.  We have people on here who went to the top Ivy league schools basically bending over and slapping each other in the balls as though they went to State School, like me.  There's no holy magic credentials that help you predict the future here in life.  Pinstripe suits, being able to spell properly, using the word, \"sophistication,\" - all form a veil of fake professionalism around what is essentially people masturbating under their desk.  I don't care if the top PhD in Public Health and the Editor of Forbes had a baby, and that baby said that Coronavirus is going to cause a massive public health disturbance -- they don't fucking know.\n\nIf they ever look down their nose at you and try to tell you that you have to pay a higher commission or whatever, you look them square in the eye for a split second, then stare at the floor, summon as much autistic energy as you can, and blurt out a percentage point that you are going to want to see and if their next word is not, \"OK,\" you fucking leave and transfer your money out of there without even a word.\n\nIn short, it's idiots all the way to the fucking top.  If you have been on /wsb for a while you can clearly see that a decent portion of the financial industry spend an inordinate amount of time here, calling ourselves retards and gay.  These are the same people who are handling your money, programming trading apps, etc., do not let them fuck with your money.", "created_utc": 1582730316, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9uqas/its_your_fucking_money/", "is_self": true}
