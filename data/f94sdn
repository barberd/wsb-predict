Thoughts?", "selftext": "Hey Gang - there\u2019s been so much talk about the corona virus that I almost missed this one.  A couple of weeks ago, the differential was around .13.  Today the one and ten year bond differential is at .03, still in favour of the ten year, but not by much.  While I don\u2019t necessarily put a ton of faith in the differential as a prognostic, the trading algorithms do.  Wondering what the possible effects of a double whammy of virus panic and an inverted yield curve might do.\n\nThought?\n\nCheers,\n\nPD", "created_utc": 1582605757, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f94sdn/one_year_and_ten_year_bond_differential_is_down/", "is_self": true}
