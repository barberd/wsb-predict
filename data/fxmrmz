They have the most efficient drive through, the most efficient deliveries.\n\nTheir growth has mainly been driven (haha) by their take home/get delivered segment. As this hits, it is probably the only restaurant that people trust the standard of quality that the company delivers.\n\nWhat this means for the restaurant industry is that every other chain in the world will get hit harder than McD, and this drop in Revenue has had a significant impact for McD operations. I think it is prety clear that the restaurant industry is going to suffer ALOT and McD was a clear indicator of that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs far as positions? cash gang and buy the corner store at the end of your street, this shit makes no sense.", "created_utc": 1586411041.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxmrmz/mcd_sales_down_22/", "is_self": true}
