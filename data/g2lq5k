{"id": "g2lq5k", "title": "Crime and No Punishment: Why the Dip Won't Happen and Your Puts Will Bleed Dry", "selftext": "Good afternoon Autists.  I had an epiphany last week while compulsively refreshing my dwindling portfolio that has resulted in a dramatic shift in my trading strategies, I'd like to share it with you.  Full disclosure:  I am not a lawyer, accountant, financial expert, or any person of authority to speak on this matter.  Just some retard with too much time on his hands.  \n\nIt\u2019s been said over and over that the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.  But who defines \u201cirrationality\u201d?  If we go out to get ice cream and I tell you I don\u2019t want any, you might think I\u2019m being irrational because who the fuck doesn\u2019t like ice cream.  That might change when you find out that I\u2019m actually lactose intolerant.  Yes my insides are bitch made but you don\u2019t want me blasting the interior of your Model X with diarrhea as they reject the frozen dairy desert we had previously just enjoyed.  My abstention is now rational because you\u2019ve modified your expectations of what a normal person would do when presented with ice cream.  \n\n**\u201cCool dude, this is both gay and irrelevant.  Strike and expiration or GTFO\u201d**  \n\n\nWe\u2019ll get there.  But first let\u2019s talk about the current market and why I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s acting irrationally:  \n\nI put forth the following theory:  **The Trump Administration is actively engaged in a criminal conspiracy to bribe key figures into keeping the market afloat, forcing a V shaped recovery and maybe even revisiting ATHs.**   \n\n\nIt\u2019s no secret Trump has tied his entire reelection campaign to the economy.  Without the stock market booming his reelection campaign [has nothing else to fall back on](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-campaign-forced-shelve-2020-ad-blitz-touting-economy-because-coronavirus-pandemic-1494583).  Additionally Trump has very likely committed numerous felonies [prior to]( https://www.vox.com/2019/2/27/18243038/individual-1-cohen-trump-mueller) and [during]( https://theintercept.com/2019/10/10/trump-crimes-law/) his stint in office, both at the State and Federal level, which highlight the importance of his reelection.  He will almost certainly face invasive criminal investigation and quite possibly indictment the second he leaves office and is [no longer protected by the Office of the Presidency]( https://www.justice.gov/olc/opinion/sitting-president%E2%80%99s-amenability-indictment-and-criminal-prosecution).  \n\n\nHis foreign policy is trash, he\u2019s passed no landmark legislation to pin his name to, the wall was never built, Hillary has yet to be locked up, and now the big players are at risk of a huge financial hit if he can\u2019t get this thing turned around.  And let\u2019s be real, that last point is only one that really matters.  \n\n\nSo how do we make the jump from \u201cTrump needs good economy\u201d to \u201cyour puts will die because the market is perfectly rational\u201d?  \n\nEnter William Barr.  \n\nThe US Attorney General has taken a central role in [carrying out Trump\u2019s nefarious plans and shielding him from repercussion]( https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/01/20/william-barr-trumps-sword-and-shield).  He has gotten himself involved in numerous schemes outside the normal  jurisdiction of the Justice Department with [one instance]( https://www.npr.org/2019/10/03/766927045/how-attorney-general-barr-ended-up-at-the-center-of-the-ukraine-controversy) even leading  to Trump\u2019s impeachment and subsequent party-line acquittal.   \n\n\nYou may have found it bizarre that Billy Boy joined the President at his March 23rd COVID-19 Task Force Briefing, but probably waived it off as another sycophant fluffing his way into the President\u2019s good graces.  However, if there is one person in this administration who does not need Trump\u2019s approval to keep his job it\u2019s William Barr.  He\u2019s on a very exclusive list of people who told Trump to [kiss his balls]( https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-raises-possibility-of-suing-those-involved-in-prosecuting-roger-stone/2020/02/18/238279fc-5250-11ea-9e47-59804be1dcfb_story.html) and still kept his job and subsequent power.  Power that he\u2019s glad to wield on behalf of Trump, so long as Trump himself stays the fuck out of his way.  \n\n\nSo why was Barr up there on the 23rd?  Was he going to announce charges against vendors in the Chinese wet markets?  Institute martial law to keep people in quarantine?  You can read the transcript of the briefing [here]( https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-9/) but the TL;DR boils down to \u201cwe\u2019re cracking down on hoarding supplies\u201d.  So the nation\u2019s top prosecutor, who essentially calls his own shots, was dragged on stage to give a meaningless update on a problem that was already being solved by simply [intercepting supplies destined for other nations]( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/mask-wars-coronavirus-outbidding-demand#maincontent).  Or, even more simply, by not giving a fuck.  \n\nDo you believe that?  Because I don\u2019t.  \n\nOn the contrary, I believe Bill Barr\u2019s presence at the meeting was as *power move*, meant as a display to MMs and Business Leaders that the Attorney General was now on board.  Let me play out a hypothetical scenario for you:  \n\nTrump, knowing he\u2019s fucked, approaches these folks with an ultimatum.  \u201cPlay along and I\u2019ll take care of you like no one else ever has.  It\u2019ll be the best quid pro quo in the history of this country, trust me.  Don\u2019t fight it or else you\u2019ll be very sorry\u201d.  \n\n\u201cFuck\u201d the MM\u2019s think.  \u201cThis dipshit has no idea what he\u2019s doing.  He\u2019ll destroy the market and get us all locked up.  Do we play along and let this ride, or cover our asses the best we can?\u201d  \n\n\n\u201cUnlimited QE and I\u2019ll buy your Junk Bonds\u201d says JPow  \n\n\u201c$2T Bailout with more to come\u201d says Mitch McConnell  \n\n*\u201dBarr will protect you\u201d assures DJT*  \n\n\nThat last one though, what assurances could Barr possibly offer?  He\u2019s not the head of the SEC, the Treasury, or the IRS.   \n\n\n[Turns out the SEC has no criminal authority]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission#Divisions) and can only refer charges to the DOJ, headed by Barr\n\n[Same thing with the IRS]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRS_Criminal_Investigation_Division#Investigative_process)  \n\n[And the enforcement arms of the Treasury] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury#2003_Reorganization) (Bonus, Barr\u2019s own daughter landed a job at FinCEN in February of last year)  \n\n\nSo if you were worried about getting involved with DJT and his backroom bullshit, Barr\u2019s presence in that backroom would be quite the reassurance given his [propensity to make small annoyances like written law disappear]( https://www.businessinsider.com/doj-moves-to-drop-charges-ira-russians-indicted-mueller-2020-3) when they get in the way a good time.  Similarly, knowing the power Barr wields at the President\u2019s behest - would you be eager to cross him?  Would you want to be the first one to unload and trigger a mass selloff?  Do you want all those 3-letter agencies sniffing around your company during the greatest economic crisis of the last century?   \n\n\nOK but what if it this doesn\u2019t work?  What if Congress steps in and regulates how the allocated funds are spent?   \n\n\nSimple, [eliminate their oversight ability]( https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/27/trump-coronavirus-inspector-general/)  \n\nAnd while we\u2019re at it, [what the fuck let\u2019s just send them all home for a while]( https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-threatens-to-adjourn-congress-11586992100).  \u201cYeah that\u2019s right, they\u2019re [refusing to approve my judges]( https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-appointing-historic-number-federal-judges-uphold-constitution-written/) so what other do choice do I have in this time of crisis!\u201c  \n\n\nTaken individually these are all crackpot conspiracy theories with no real evidence for being grounded in reality.  I\u2019m not an idiot, I know that\u2019s what it looks like.  \n\n\nBut take a step back and look at the whole picture.  You have a criminal president who has an established track record of lawlessness.  This President is backed into a corner, facing potential prosecution once he leaves office and his only shot at reelection is circling the drain.  He\u2019s dragged all of his lieutenants down with him, implicating them in what is likely a vast conspiracy to defraud the United States on multiple occasions.  But, he also has the power to \u201cprint money\u201d, the power to distribute it as he pleases, and the power to cover it up.  He also has the power to make the lives of anyone who doesn\u2019t play along very, very uncomfortable.  And what\u2019s more, he\u2019s already beat these charges once before, just a few short months ago.  He\u2019s untouchable as long as everyone\u2019s making money!  \n\n\nFor this reason **I believe Trump has yet again resorted to criminal activity, promising to use the power of the Executive Branch to bribe key players into manufacturing a recovery in order to secure a strong economy for use in his reelection campaign.**  \n\n\nIf  you are willing to accept that as a possibility, if not a likelihood or outright truth, then look at how the market is behaving and ask yourself what is **rational**.  If you have an off the books agreement from the highest branches of Government securing your financial solvency and profits at no risk of penalty, do you care if:  \n\n\n- Unemployment is skyrocketing \n- Earnings are well below expectations and will continue to be well into the year \n- Small and Medium size businesses are declaring bankruptcy \n- States are perpetually extending shutdowns further and further into the spring\n- The virus is not contained and we still lack adequate testing measures \n- Consumer spending takes a nosedive\n- The supply chain is in shambles  \n\n\nFuck no you don\u2019t.  Keep the bad news coming because none of it matters.  Go ahead you fucking retards, short the market and see what happens.  We\u2019re riding this thing till the wheels come off and if/when that happens it\u2019ll be Trump they line up against a wall, not us.  \n\n\nSo everyone holding those SPY puts expiring  May \u2013 July expecting a major drop any day now are going to be sorely disappointed when that just doesn\u2019t happen.   Your account is going to bleed dry because no revelation with regards to the Virus or subsequent shutdown is going to trigger that selloff.  That\u2019s my theory.   \n\n\nYou followed u/variation-separate \u2018s awesome posts and bought puts at 270 expecting the dip.  The logic was sound but the markets don\u2019t care  \n\n\nYou followed u/fuzzyblankeet \u2018s post about 10-K\u2019s and bought puts on F.  The logic was sound but the markets don\u2019t care  \n\nThere is no amount of logic, TA, or fundamentals that can be applied to a market that is operating exclusively off a wink and nod behind closed doors.  \n\n\nSo as for advice, I am personally avoiding short ETF positions and instead looking at some of the quality DD relating to individual tickers.  I plan to maintain a few long dated puts on vulnerable sectors like real estate and dumb consumer goods, while holding a large cash reserve and making small intraday plays when opportune.  You shouldn\u2019t do this though because I truly have no clue what the fuck I\u2019m talking about.  \n\nA few things I\u2019m looking for that would indicate a downturn if my theory is correct:  Congress getting tough on oversight of the funds, McConnell breaking ranks and refusing additional funding, friction between Trump and Barr/Powell, power players from Trump\u2019s corner getting mouthy.  If any of those are followed by a 2-3 day dip I\u2019ll probably buy back in.  \n\nPositions:  My portfolio is fucked after diamond hands, but I\u2019ve realigned for intraday calls on SPY, tech giants, essential manufacturing and distribution (KMB, PG, MDLZ because I work with those companies), VNQ $60p 6/19 (because I do believe REITs are actually fucked) \n\nThanks for reading.  I\u2019ll take my ban like a champ \n\nOh one last thing, remember Barr\u2019s March 23rd pep rally?
