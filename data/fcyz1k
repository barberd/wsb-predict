{"id": "fcyz1k", "title": "RobinHood; Shit for Another Reason", "selftext": "Robinhood has been getting shit on for their incredible system uptime, but in the hoopla I\u2019ve yet to see anyone rail against how shitty their latest UI update is.\n\nMy issues are two fold, the watchlists they force feed you replacing the old watchlist are just trash. They fucked it up so all the useful info (ticker, Day\u2019s graph, and % change) are fucking microscopic all to make room to list out the full name of the equity. Like why the fuck? If it\u2019s on my watchlist I damn know what the fuck it stands for. We\u2019re autistic, what makes them think that memorizing a sequence of letters and what they\u2019re correspond to in long form is too hard??\n\nMy second issue is that to expand your watchlist you have to click to expand it, and then scroll through your shit. That\u2019s one more click I didn\u2019t have to make before, and it pisses me right off. It totally disrupts the navigation and flow of doing a quick Russian roulette scroll to find the next bad decision to buy stupid OTM options on\n\nFuck this shit. Garbage system reliability is one thing, but god awful UI/UX design is a bridge too far", "created_utc": 1583260096, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fcyz1k/robinhood_shit_for_another_reason/", "is_self": true}
