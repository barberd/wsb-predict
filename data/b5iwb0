This thread will contain some nuance and level-headed explanations. There's a lot of fearmongering out there and on WSB regarding this topic, but these discussions lack basic exposition. I will attempt to dive into something extra and explain the very real, almost unavoidable consequences of yesterday's inversion. \n\n-\n\n-\n\nDon't confuse this 3m/10y inversion with the inversion that happened in December. What happened in December was inversion of the 3y/5y and 2y/5y yields. Every inversion can be thought of as variably important economic indicators because of their perverse nature. Not every inversion though is important enough to hinge investment policy on. The December inversions, while important, are anomalies that signal towards an increased risk of volatility, but not necessarily *certainty* of future volatility. \n\nThat's not to say a 3m/10y somehow for sure precludes certain volatility or massive slowdown, but I would argue that prolonged presence of the 3m/10y inversion can *only* lead to negative outcomes. This does not mean recession without a doubt. You can have slowed GDP growth without delving into bonafide recession. \n\nThe 'best' worst-case scenario here is that the stock market stops being, for maybe 5-10 years, the best bet for making money. This kind of revision away from the stock market is not only normal, but perfectly healthy.\n\n-\n\nThe reason the 3m/10y inversion is important is because of the role banks play in stimulating business growth. Debt is an important aspect of every economy, and banks make it possible for any business looking to grow or continue operating to take out debt at a reasonable rate. \n\nWhen the 10y yield is lower than the 3m yield, banks no longer have an incentive to stick their proverbial necks out and agree to long-term loans. Banks will, **without a doubt**, reduce their long-term lending practices if this 3m/10y inversion holds. Anything less would be stupid and raise alarm for shareholders everywhere. Why would you risk more to gain less? This is the real world, not WSB. Now extend that reasoning to a bank worth 100B and responsible for a large portion of the economy. \n\n-\n\nIf this inversion holds for another 2-3+, expect to see some very large changes in lending practices worldwide. They may not be immediately noticeable, but they will come, and expecting otherwise from big banks would be foolish. \n\n-\n\n-\n\nIN MY OPINION, the only thing that can save us, and the reason for this inversion, is reversal of Brexit. The whole of the EU is faltering. China is faltering. Germany saw their 10y yields outright turn *negative*. People investing in German 10y notes are *giving* money away because their outlook of the broader European/German economic landscape is that bloody dismal. \n\nThe UK leaving the EU will almost definitely cause a UK recession because the Tories are so desperately unprepared. A UK recession will almost definitely cause an EU recession. Now ask yourself what makes the United States so special that the largest trading block in the world can lapse back into a recession and not have it affect us. \n\nBrexit is one of the biggest geopolitical happenings since The Great Recession. Before that, it was World War II. \n\n-\n\n-\n\nAgain, I'm not saying that we will for sure go into a recession if Brexit happens, or if the 3m/10y inversion holds for another 2-3+ months, but a reduction of GDP growth to less than 1% would lead to corrections in quite a few sectors. \n\nI personally welcome it (slowed GDP growth, not recession) because volatility is what we all live for. If the prospect of volatility doesn't get you excited, WSB probably isn't for you.
