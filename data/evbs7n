We need:\n   1. quarterly percent change in the 10-YR T Note\n   2. quarterly percent change in the s&amp;p 500\n   3. quarterly percent change in the HPI\n   4. some metric of M&amp;A activity, built from web scraped news, that we calculate and standardize\n   5. an aggregate gain/loss of bank earnings for that quarter\n2. Build a classifier that outputs +/- when run on our four predictor features the night before bank earnings week.\n3. Buy near the money puts or calls for each bank the next day, hold all week.\n4. Profit.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Do we do this? Or just always buy calls in accordance with the bayes optimal classifier (stonks only go up)?.", "created_utc": 1580246264, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/evbs7n/computer_bros_of_the_sub_hear_me_out/", "is_self": true}
