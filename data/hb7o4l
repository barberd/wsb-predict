It is done through a financial mechanism called a \u201cRepo\u201d\u2014essentially a very short term (overnight to one month) loan given using safe securities, in this case treasury bonds, as collateral. The bottom line is it creates immediate liquidity and cash flow options for MMs, who then put it back into the market in the form of securities investment. Thus, the pump.\n\n[https://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed04.html](https://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed04.html)\n\nThe suspicious strength of the pumps led me to wonder how this was actually functioning and timed, and if It could help provide predictably during the current crazy market volatility. This is what I found. \n\nLet\u2019s start with the positive performances of SPY over the past month and half.\n\nOn May 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th, SPY had a nice rally highlighted by a 1.6% jump on the 8th. After cooling off, on May 14th, 15th, and 18th it rallied up after a dip, with a notably strong jump of 3% (2.95) on May 18th. To close out May it hot up on the 26th and 27th, before one last jump on the 29th.\n\nIn June, SPY ripped on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, 4th, 9th, and 10th before the shitshow on the 11th. Huge bounce back on the 12th.\n\nIf you look at the corresponding Fed repo schedule ([https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/repo-reverse-repo-agreements/repurchase-agreement-operational-details](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/repo-reverse-repo-agreements/repurchase-agreement-operational-details)), you\u2019ll see that the largest positive SPY increase days in May are correlated with the dates special dates where the Fed did two repo\u2019s\u2014the daily overnight AND an additional term repo (only one wasn\u2019t noticeably large of an increase, but it was still an increase) but it was in the middle of a few day rally)\n\nPractically speaking that means each Tuesday of the next month should see an uptick in SPY since they are listed as the double dates.\n\nHow that plays out in this crazy, unsure week? I was going to be itching for Tuesday, disappointed that it\u2019s the (seemingly) far date of the next dual repo (overnight and term loan). **but then I saw that the Friday the 12th we rally we just had fell on the day this month\u2019s new Repo schedule took affect**. Then I looked back through the schedule for 6 months, and saw without fail the day the new repo schedule is released is a positive jump for SPY. In other words, the downward correction that was happening on Thursday June 11th was bailed out by a new Friday repo scheduling. What lucky timing for da bulls.\n\n**This time there is nothing to bail out the flash crash (unless we get an impromptu Donnie Pump going hard on vaccines) and tomorrow is a downswing.** **Load up on VXX 6/19 calls tomorrow, ride it through at least tomorrow though we will likely go down through Friday because there\u2019s no repo excitement to lift the markets (no new schedule release and no dual repo operation until Tuesday).** **Pick up 6/26 SPY calls Friday EOD if you\u2019re confident in a good weekend news cycle, but better would be Monday for the Tuesday dual-repo pump**\n\nAn interesting note is that they change the time of the operations in week or two week chunks throughout the month.  Tin foil hat aside, I think this is done purposefully to create a sense of randomness in the pumps.  You know how we always mention the two pm pump?  They mix up the operation times after a bit so you don't play it like clockwork.\n\n**TLDR:** by VXX calls cuz we\u2019re going down until Friday. Next week on Tuesday we have a sharp pop up so get SPY calls on Monday.", "created_utc": 1592454863.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hb7o4l/dd_predictable_unpredictability_playing_spy_and/", "is_self": true}
