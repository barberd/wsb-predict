{"id": "g69ccz", "title": "$LYV Free (Or Die!): Fuzzy's Live Nation Breakdown", "selftext": "Hello, friends -\n\nIt's me, Fuzzy.  [Sorry 4 The Wait](https://soundcloud.com/user-850853278/sets/lil-wayne-sorry-4-the-wait-1). Notice anything different? I agree - this **does** look good on me (seriously though, it's just so I can beat the auto-mod). Shoutout to the real mods for setting this up - long $WSB.\n\nIt's been a crazy week in the debt markets which means it's been a crazy week for me, so I've been a little slow in getting this up. But now it's *aperitivo* hour at Casa de Fuzzy and I've cleared my inbox, so as promised way back in my [$PLAY breakdown](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fx6b0t/playtimes_over_fuzzy_does_db/), today we're going to be looking at $LYV's debt package. I'm excited about this one. Long-time readers know that Fuzzy loves music so we should be able to work a few choice cuts and some groan-worthy puns into the mix here along with your regularly scheduled breakdown.\n\nBefore we do though - let's check the scoreboard on our previous posts. $[SIX](https://otp.tools.investis.com/clients/us/sixflags1/SEC/sec-show.aspx?Type=html&FilingId=14074022&CIK=0000701374&Index=10000). $[SEAS](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001564902/01f0e5d7-f481-4f6a-8581-3e413b3c916e.pdf). $[PLAY](http://ir.daveandbusters.com/static-files/79f0a503-4fff-434a-9e09-1b75bf1cb9dd).  In the words of [the immortal Dion Waiters](https://mlwlbd.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/dion-waiters-nba-brooklyn-nets-cleveland-cavaliers.jpg) \\-\n\n>\"MEN LIE WOMEN LIE \\[DEBT\\] DNT\".\\*\n\n\\*( u/pokimane, don't worry, girl - obviously this doesn't apply to you).\n\nNo matter what the equity price says, the true health of most companies can be divined by what's going on with their debt, especially in these crazy times. Here are some of the (new/surprising) things that I've been seeing most frequently over the last week:\n\n* A lot of companies in the market are experimenting with 'freezing' EBITDA or whatever their equivalent metric is at 12/31/2019 levels to get the benefit of the good fiscal environment last year to ease them through 2020.\n* Covenant relief waivers are everywhere and most lenders are asking for steep consent fees to grant them and minimum liquidity covenants to make sure no one goes bananas with their cash.\n* Interest rates on new debt are approaching usurious levels because of the risk factors involved with new money.\n* Virtually \\*every\\* non-IG company currently in the market is asking for a dedicated debt carveout for whatever form the Main St. loan program winds up taking. This signals that availability is going to be widespread and that (a bit like the Fed phantom bailouts we've been talking about in the comments and in my [$F post)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqk15o/fallen_angels_shitty_cars_worse_debt_and_what_it/) the true target is not small business but mid-to-large cap publicly traded companies (again, signals suggest that this will be distributed predominantly in the retail and hospitality space). From what I've hearing these loans are going to be (i) unsecured (ii) at incredibly low rates and (iii) partially (or even entirely) forgivable.\n\nWith all this in mind, it's actually good that the $LYV post got delayed because some of what I've mentioned above applies directly to them.  Here's what you'll need to play along at home.\n\n* [$LYV's 10-K](https://investors.livenationentertainment.com/sec-filings/annual-reports/content/0001335258-20-000028/0001335258-20-000028.pdf).\n* [$LYV's Credit Agreement](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1335258/000133525820000028/lyv-20191231xex1028.htm) (conformed through **Amendment No. 6**). Now, before any of you nerds or JV traders in the back get smart with me, I know that Amendment No. 7 is the one they've just passed, so there is a more current version, but that hasn't been filed yet. Lucky for you guys, though, I managed to get my hands on a copy. My post reflects the doc conformed through Amendment No. 7 so you're just going to have to take my word for it on some of this stuff. When it gets filed publicly I'll update the post with a new link if you want to fact check me.\n* [$LYV's press release describing what they're doing with Amendment No. 7.](https://investors.livenationentertainment.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001335258-20-000063/0001335258-20-000063.pdf)\n* [Some music.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhrglt2nmIGgEdOLAD15bHADI3cDMT33C) If like Fuzzy you love jazz, funk and/or crate digging do yourself a favor and spend some of your FD money on some Stone's Throw shit. Thank me later.\n* A drink. If you want to do it Fuzzy-style I like an espresso to wake me up and something stronger - bitter and Italian - to wash it down around this time of the day, but whatever floats your boat will do just fine. Although your mom and I get along like a house on fire, I'm not your real dad, slugger, and I can't tell you what to do.\n\n**TL;DR?** Fuck you. There is no TL;DR. Bitch about it to your body pillow, not in the comments, because I just don't give a fuck. I promise if you furrow those eyebrows for the next 6-8 minutes, you might just learn something and add a wrinkle or two to that smooth brain of yours. Don't worry - I'll be gentle and I'll explain all the long words.\n\nFinal notes for first-timers or slow learners:\n\n* If you have specific questions, feel free to ask in the comments - I'll respond to anything sincere and/or funny.\n* Don't ask me what to buy - long-time readers know I don't give advice for free and I'll just roast you and make you look like a big dummy.\n* Most upvoted ticker gets the post after $LULU which will drop on Friday.\n\nReady? Let's get started.\n\n**1.** **$LYV-Ing on a Prayer: Target Review**\n\nRemember that you can't review these documents in the abstract; you need to look at them in the context of the company's overall financial picture. That means understanding what makes the company tick. So let's do that. $LYV's business has three main arms: (i) production of live events (ii) management of talent and (iii) sales of tickets. They have a pretty solid claim to being the biggest player in each of these markets - especially following the acquisition of Ticketmaster in 2016, which gave them a massive ecommerce platform to go with their solid actual product offerings. They describe this structure as a flywheel which is a bullshit concept cribbed from a shitty book called *Good to Great* that a lot of c-suite wannabes and West Coast business school grads swear (OK, maybe not Stanford) by but I'll just call it what it is which is a well diversified corporate structure with some sensible synergies between the different limbs of the business.\n\nSide note: I **hate** business jargon or corporate-speak. Whenever you see someone obscuring simple concepts behind complex or overly metaphorical language it's the ultimate tell that that person either (i) wants to hide how easy their job really is from the world at large or (ii) doesn't actually understand what the fuck they're talking about. This is absolutely fucking **endemic** in the legal/finance industries and it's part of the reason I do these posts. As I tell my idiot juniors, if you can't explain it in two sentences - max - you don't get it, so don't fake it with fancy words.\n\nAnyway. Last year's financials (my COMMENTS IN CAPS). The more important stuff is in the next section (Feb 2020 numbers) and considering COVID but for the purposes of this section let's just go through it.\n\nFY 2019 NUMBERS\n\n* Revenue: $11.5 Billion (up 7% YOY)  GOOD\n* Operating Income: Up 19% to $325 Million (up 19% YOY) GOOD\n* Adjusted Operating Income: $943 Million (up 14% YOY) GOOD - ALTHOUGH TAKE WITH A GRAIN OF SALT FOR THE SAME REASONS WE DISCUSSED IN OUR [EBITDA BREAKDOWN](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1xq3e/cookin_the_books_with_tsla_fuzzys_ebitda_explainer/)\n* \"Event-Related Deferred Revenue\":  $1.2 Billion as of December 31 (up 10% YOY) SALES FOR FUTURE EVENTS - THIS IS ALWAYS A GOOD INDICATOR\n\n2020 NUMBERS (FROM FEB)\n\n* 38 Million concert tickets sold for 2020 Shows (up 10% YOY) COOL\n* Confirmed shows up 30% YOY OK\n* 70% of Budgeted Sponsorship Net Revenue Committed for 2020 THIS IS REALLY GOOD BECAUSE IT SHOWS THAT THEIR SPONSORSHIP REVENUE IS CLIMBING. TO HAVE REACHED THIS FIGURE IN FEB IS A SIGN OF HEALTH\n\n$LYV actually runs a pretty tight ship overall. They've had almost a decade of continuous growth and they made a smart acquisition with Ticketmaster. It's a shitty platform but it's essentially a monopoly and it syncs well with their existing businesses. Live entertainment is also essentially future-proof because I don't think at home hologram concerts will be here anytime soon and even if they DID arrive soon, asking the cute barista to come back to your place and watch a hologram wouldn't have quite the same cachet as telling her you've got a spare ticket to the [Strokes show on Friday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eF3kyNs_i1M). But. And it's a big but. What makes them a good business moving forward makes them **uniquely** soft to the bat flu - they're entirely dependent on people actually getting outside and being able to gather in large numbers. Surprise! That ain't happening anytime soon, and they're already on the hook for production costs for most of this year **plus** I'm sure wave after wave of refund requests are flooding in from angry punters unhappy they won't see [Tay-Tay work out her daddy issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-ORhEE9VVg) live on stage at the Garden (side note: Tay-Tay is a Fuzzy Fave and probably a 12/13 seed in the Popstar bracket. I badly want her in the Southern Belle bracket where the country thing might give her an edge but she's from PA so I can't in good conscience as a Southern man let her in).\n\nSo, we're going to need to look at how they might deal with this in the context of their debt package. Remember - debt isn't bad. Every company runs on debt. But debt does eventually need to get paid back - there's no such thing as a free lunch (except maybe when Papa Trump is buying) - and not being able to pay it back can mean nasty things. $LYV have massively reduced revenue coming in for the foreseeable future (not zero, as they still have the agency side of the business going). They also don't have huge overheads or rent costs like the other businesses we've looked at, so that's good. But they will need some cash liquidity to keep going and so we need to think about what they can incur along with what they'll need to pay back.\n\n**2. $LYV Debt Structure Breakdown**\n\n$LYV's current debt package looks like this:\n\n* Delayed Draw Term A Loan: $400,000,000 term loan facility due October 17, 2024 available to be drawn in up to 10 borrowings within 24 months of the Amendment No. 6 Effective Date; subject to pro forma maintenance covenant compliance for any single borrowing >$100 million\n* Term B-4 Loan: $950,000,000 term loan facility due October 17, 2026\n* Revolver: $500,000,000 revolver due October 17, 2024 2020-1\n* Incremental Revolver: $120,000,000 revolver due October 17, 2024\n* 4.75% Senior Notes ($950m)\n* 4.875% Senior Notes ($575m)\n* 5.625% Senior Notes ($575m)\n* 2.5% Convertible Senior Notes ($550m)\n\nI had a look at the bonds which are generally OK and aren't too restrictive, so today we're just going to focus on the Credit Agreement as this actually has some stuff they need to worry about (hence the recent Amendments). Before we dive into the docs, let's walk through what these different kinds of loans are and what they do.\n\n* **Term Loan (TL).** Think of these like a great one night stand. Let me explain. A TL is like a one night stand in that the bank gives it all away up front - no second date required. You just pay amort which is normally 1%. But, 7 years down the line, you have to pay the **entire** amount back, plus interest. So I guess it's more like a one night stand where you have a great time, don't speak to her again, and 9 months later she's calling you telling you that you've got a brand new smooth brained little rugrat and you better pony up **now**.\n* **Delayed Draw Term Loan** (**DDTL**). Like if you agreed to have the same one night stand we talked about in the TL section, but that it could happen **on demand**. You don't quite feel like it now, but in 12 months maybe you get lonely and after a few too many Frescas you make that risky call, she comes over and hey presto, you're in business. One difference - for the entire time she's hanging out there on the hook waiting around for your call, you have to pay a fee (sometimes called an unused commitment fee) that's a percentage of the overall commitment. The reason the bank needs a fee is that if they're setting this money aside just for you at some indefinite point in the future, they need compensation for not being able to put it to work for someone else in the meantime.\n* **Revolver.** Corporate credit card. Borrow as much or as little as you need and pay it back at your convenience. Once you've repaid part of it, you can borrow it again. Generally used for liquidity and operating expenses.\n* **Incremental Revolver.** We talked about incremental debt in our $SEAS post but basically this means that you have the capacity to add additional debt into your existing credit agreement (rather than going out and getting a brand new credit agreement from someone else). You can get incremental term debt too - sometimes even incremental DDTL debt for the truly deviant.\n\n**3. $LYV Covenant and Flexibility Breakdown**\n\nSo. Here's where it gets interesting. $LYV actually has a pretty conservative and bank friendly credit agreement. You hopefully know how this works by now - let's rocket down to the negative covenants to learn the rules they've gotta play by to keep the lenders happy.\n\n*Financial Covenant*\n\nUnlike many borrowers in today's market, $LYV's credit agreement actually has a maintenance covenant on both the revolver and on the term loan (peep Section 8.10; CTRL+ \"Financial Covenant\"). This means that there are certain ratios they need to stay in compliance with in order to (i) keep the banks happy / not have to repay money / be in default and (ii) incur certain additional debt. In this case, it's \"Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio\" - CTRL+F to find out that this means that the debt to EBITDA ratio needs to be at a certain level.\n\nObviously, the EBITDA here is going to take a huge hit moving forward, so this covenant is toast for the next 12 months. So what $LYV have had them do (and this is in the next Amendment, so don't stress that you can't see it yet) is **freeze** the EBITDA for 2020 at the 2019 levels to make sure they won't be in breach. Cool idea, huh? In return, the banks asked for a couple of things:\n\n* During this period, certain limitations on debt buybacks (when they repurchase debt from the lenders) / restricted payments (paying for shit or making dividends) / investments AND\n* A minimum liquidity covenant of $500 million. This (essentially) means that they need to keep $500 million in free cash on hand for the period of the EBITDA freeze period. They get to include $150m of that \"Event Deferred Revenue\" in here, plus whatever's not drawn under the revolver, so really it's $350 minus the $120m new incremental revolver so it's $220m cash on hand in total.\n\nDollars to donuts the reason they've done this is so that they can go out and get some more debt to keep themselves afloat or to buy up some competitors (they need covenant compliance to use some of the baskets I'm going to talk about below)\n\n*Debt Incurrence*\n\nI'm not going to walk through all the baskets but let's look at the key ones. Everything other than the incremental stuff is in Section 8.06 \"Indebtedness\". The great thing about these Credit Agreements is that once you teach yourself to read it once, they are all easy to work through because the important shit is generally in the same place every time.\n\n* Incremental debt - Let's go to Section 2.06(f)(i)(x). This is how much shit they can incur as incremental debt **before** they get any extra credit - $985 million bucks. This gets built up by an **unlimited amount** provided they comply with a 3.75x secured debt leverage ratio which also gets the benefit of their EBITDA freeze I discussed above. To get really technical there is a drafting error in the new amendment which means they could technically tap this without complying with the new liquidity covenant (some junior is going to get pasted for this a few years down the track if this gets abused). Guess the banks should have hired Fuzzy. $LYV board members, if you're reading this, give me a call.\n* Ratio debt - Check out section 8.06(f). This fucking word jumble - if you pick out the only bit that matters which is the bit that refers to \"compliance with Section 8.10\" - says that they can incur unlimited debt if they're in ratio compliance. Remember that ol' EBITDA freeze? Ding ding ding again. They can tap this bad boy for as much as they need as long as they're in covenant compliance, which isn't an issue for the next little while at least.\n* General debt - Money they can use for whatever they want. These guys actually have **two** of these baskets which is pretty cool - have a look at 8.06(j) and 8.06(bb). First one is for the greater of $500m and 7.5% of their total asset value and the second is for $460m subject again to covenant compliance (with the kicker that this needs to be unsecured debt only). I imagine they will tap the second basket for the Main St. loans we talked about on top but the first one is great and can be combined with the other baskets above.\n* Foreign subs - Money that can only be borrowed by non-US entities. 8.06(h) - $500m which is a lot for this kind of basket but I guess makes sense if they are structurally spread out. There's also a dedicated $75m basket just for an Aussie sub so I guess they have a lot of interest in kangaroo boxing or whatever the fuck it is those people do down there.\n\nSo, by my count, we're talking about $2.4bn of free debt they can tap during the next 12 months. I am almost positive they will use most if not all of this - as the bat flu won't allow concerts even if Papa trump puts us all back in the office next week. They may also consider an acquisition spree. This is good news for them as it's enough to cover upcoming maturities in the bonds and the existing debt. Clearly they also have forgiving banks (even if the banks have shitty lawyers), so they will have plenty of wiggle room moving forward.\n\nThat's all for me today Fuzz fam. $LULU on Friday.
