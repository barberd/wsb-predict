{"id": "cxm6gg", "title": "Earnings and IV harvesting", "selftext": "So was watching Sam Kinnison (?) on tastyworks. They were saying to sell strangles/condors at 1 standard deviation from midpoint. For example, I just looked at ulta and saw September 6 options were pricing in about a $14 move (atm put+call /2). So in essence, if you put on a condor let\u2019s say at both 14$ above and 14$ below the last trading price, seems like max loss would be very small and max gain was like $1.15 per spread. Also statistically the options would expire worthless frequently because a lot of companies don\u2019t do shit after earnings (looking at you GPS) and will end within the standard deviation range.\n\nChange my mind. \u2615\ufe0f", "created_utc": 1567195689, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cxm6gg/earnings_and_iv_harvesting/", "is_self": true}
