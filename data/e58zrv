I'm impressed", "selftext": "Now, at first, I thought this whole \"infinite leverage thing\" was just a bunch of low life camel jockeys trying to break Robinhood and Guh some tendies away at a last-ditch effort to make themselves rich, but in reality probably losing it all.\n\nBut\n\nI have seen through the fog.  This is really a massive strategic ploy at establishing WSB as a credible source to the Media for discovering bugs in the Robinhood platform, then subsequently abusing them all in the name of looking at the Robinhood IPO.  \n\nI know what the majority of you are thinking \n\n\"I wish I could read because this looks interesting\"\n\nor\n\n\"Stonks only go up\"\n\nSo, lemme explain.  Its 2025 and Robinhood finally managed to find a recent high school grad to call themselves their CFO and after many errors and pinning all of the missteps on said CFO and ruining his life, Robinhood is FINALLY public! \n\nDuring this time, WSB was constantly delaying the process and finding various ways to abuse the platform.  Each time a bug was discovered, WSB abused it, and the Media covered it.  Therefore, the media can assume \"when WSB finds a bug, they are going to abuse it and lose Robinhood alot of money, and Robinhood will not patch it\".  Prior to this, everyone will assume the stock will go down, and the WSB will abuse it so much that the stock will go down due to the significant loss.  While everyone is sitting here thinking \"These kids are psychopaths\" what they don't know, is WSB loaded up on Puts every single time prior to the bug releases and used their image as short-sighted, autistic, brain-dead, nutsack-for-eye-lids, neanderthals to consistently manipulate the stock price. \n\nWell done kid.
