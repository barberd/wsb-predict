{"id": "du1j4n", "title": "Getting Better With Each Trade", "selftext": "Hello friends, just want to post something somewhat valuable that's not a joke or edgy or whatever.\n\nBeen trading for 5 months now and at present day I can say that I've won small and lost bigger. I'm preparing for Monday to tank what is left in my account after a little less than thoughtful bet on Activision blizzard. I was in about 1100 on call options exp 11/15. A couple weeks before this I lost a huge 1500 on AMD because I panic sold it when the stock dipped after ER, I was holding 11/15s on that play as well, which now would have made me very profitable.\n\nI won small on options for Master card, Nvidia a month back and Spy. Even though I feel great about those small wins, I hate myself for pushing limits and losing pretty much everything. But I think there are definitely positives to losing money like this. First thing I learned was to not bet on weeklies. For now on, I'm only doing monthlies. I also learned the hard way about IV crush and low volume options, and buying options at bad entry points. I definitely feel like I am smarter for these little mistakes.\n\nMy next plays will be much more calculated. Right now I'm looking at Nike calls for January exp, Zillow calls for 2021, and I'm gonna take another jab at amd for January exp. But this time I'm looking for better entries and focusing on DD for these specific companies. \n\nI will be back and hopefully will be posting big gains porn in the near future. Feel free to post your short comings and how you plan to get better", "created_utc": 1573332627, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/du1j4n/getting_better_with_each_trade/", "is_self": true}
