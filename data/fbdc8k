I was all green for all but 10 minutes, and in the last 5 minutes I just watched my SPY, TRIP and CCL turn deep red without wanting to touch them anymore because I know losses are only real when you sell.\n\nOn the other hand, the fearporn on beer virus today have been giving me back faith slowly in this rigged ass market that I am so lucky to experience on my very first 2 hours in the market ever. UAL is my only green right now and I know its gonna be even better on Monday since they just offered reduced pay leave to their pilots.\n\nHaving said that, I lowkey need yall to assure me Monday is gunna b gud so these gay bulls know they only really make money off rigged plays.", "created_utc": 1582986942, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fbdc8k/yesterday_was_on_me/", "is_self": true}
