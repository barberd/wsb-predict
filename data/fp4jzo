Who can know, we aren\u2019t insiders at the CDC. They\u2019re not going to report the true number of cases either because 1.) they can\u2019t test em all 2.) they don\u2019t want to test em all. \n\nSo look, yeah a fuck ton people are losing jobs, but what happens when mid April hits, and things begin to re-open? I\u2019ve read a lot of your posts and you guys seem to be favoring 4/17 puts and so on, but what if we really do \u201cget back to work\u201d by Easter as trump says. That screws all you April, may, June put hungry bastards. \n\nIs it possible that this is the worst it\u2019ll be? Dear god I hope not but it seems like people want hope again. The grocery stores are calming down, there is not sudden rush or urge to spaz out and go crazy for supplies anymore, and the $1200 checks are coming in. \n\nIf the social distancing is effective in these next 2 weeks, and numbers begin to level off, and hospitals aren\u2019t overcrowded....well then may god have mercy on your beautiful souls\n\nSPYc 346 11/20 \nSPYc 330 11/20 \nSPYc 293 3/27\nMRNAp 22.5 3/9", "created_utc": 1585194009.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fp4jzo/what_if_people_start_working_by_easter_in_most/", "is_self": true}
