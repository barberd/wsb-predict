For the truly truly autistic - there is Micron.\n\nHere's my reasoning - the market has sold off a whole bunch in the past week, but some look much weaker than others right now. I wouldn't touch Apple with a 10 foot pole because it has gone up so far, and was the favorite for so long. But if there is a rebound, which stocks might be the strongest? Not the ones everyone has been FOMOing into for the past 2 months because those people have just got burned (I'm looking at you MSFT $200 call holders). \n\nAnd definitely not $SPCE - probably one of the worst ideas ever to come across this sub. \n\nIf I look at which ones have held up very strong the past week and close on Friday, Nvidia definitely gets my attention. It's been a slower climber but recently broke out and last week just retested its upward trend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$NVDA still on an linear uptrend, up 7&amp;#37; on Friday 2\\/28](https://preview.redd.it/a9vdb1w6l5k41.png?width=909&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0f7eb6f3ac9f0cf270f390dac9608d48d6ebbfe)\n\nMedia companies with no physical presence (hence coronavirus safe) also seem like decent bets. I'm talking about Netflix and Facebook here. $FB and $NFLX are the only FAANG stocks not breaking out to new highs recently and there could be a rotation of money into them as they are minimally affected by coronavirus. Also Facebook has announced a $10 billion stock buyback.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$NFLX mostly flat last week, still in solid uptrend](https://preview.redd.it/fhafupxfl5k41.png?width=880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72057d5a941678e3deda16910e4418f4e988180f)\n\nDon't have a position because last week was insane, but watching.", "created_utc": 1583108822, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fc3j65/strong_tech_stocks_for_potential_market_rebound/", "is_self": true}
