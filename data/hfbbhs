And for awhile, it seemed that it was the correct move. Cases weren\u2019t going down but they weren\u2019t going up either. Throughout most of may we even saw a slight though not significant decline. Governors and citizens became encouraged and started lifting restrictions and abandoning social distancing rules.\n\nHistory I promise you will rudely stamp these moves into textbooks as a lesson for people to learn from in responding to future epidemics and pandemics.\n\nWe are in the middle of the next COVID crisis. Anyone who is telling you otherwise is frankly lying, or ignorant.\n\nCase counts have soared back to March and April levels, and it seems all but foretold that we will see the US break its record for coronavirus cases in a day by the end of next week. But this time, it\u2019s worse: we have people ignoring social distancing rules across the country, believing the rhetoric of a deranged carrot saying the coronavirus is \u2018fading away.\u2019 \n\nThe fear that helped save lives before has dissipated as the storm of warnings aren\u2019t hitting people living under the umbrella of misinformation.\n\nDr. Fauci and Dr. Gotlieb, two doctors for whatever the world thinks of them are some of the better experts on Coronavirus, have been messaging you for weeks warning things are getting out of control. Dr. Gotlieb mentioned this recent friday that the likelihood schools are going to be able to open nationally is in serious doubt. Dr. Fauci mentioned that the NFL may have serious trouble playing in the fall. These doctors, who understand way more about the virus than we do, are saying \u2018We are going to have serious alterations to our lifestyles through the end of this year.\u2019\n\nGovernor Greg \u2018I guess I rushed into reopening\u2019 Abbot just made a plea to Texans to not go anywhere unless they need to. Texas is the number two GDP state in the country. Basically giving a casual stay at home order does not bode well for the productivity of Texas, nor the outlook of its ability to fight the virus.\n\nCalifornia is really getting out of control. It\u2019s the number one GDP producing state. Florida doesn\u2019t give a fuck and man does the virus not give a fuck about their not giving a fuck. It\u2019s the number four GDP producing state.\n\nThis is getting so bad that the EU is considering a ban on travel from the US. You thought airlines had it rough with no flights to China and Europe for the last couple months? If they can\u2019t get in a decent travel summer season on international flights, good luck to your calls. Hopefully JPow creates a credit facility to give loans to fucked airline call buyers since the government is willing to collateralize just about every other part of the airlines for their loans.\n\nWe are simply doomed at this point to repeat our recent history. There will be a lot of denial, shouting, the carrot will turn red with anger, and there may even be violence, but eventually we will see some parts of the country forced to shut back down in the coming weeks and months. It\u2019ll become a matter of hospital capacity becoming so overloaded that the state simply cannot manage the crisis.\n\nBulls will say what they\u2019ve said since the bottom: the fed will print the road out of this.\nYeah, that was going to work for round one. Round two? Not so much.\n\nAnd the fed will have to start getting religious if inflation gets out of control. You can look at the inflation rate released every month and say \u2018well the rate looks very disinflationary.\u2019 Yeah, that\u2019s not really how its playing out. Groceries are becoming more expensive, a tell-tale sign that inflation is kicking in hard. Commodity prices are generally rising (Even for oil, as oil inventories destroy expectations every time.) Meanwhile the DXY index is shedding value like its on a weight loss program. All of this to say: The fed can bridge a gap, it cannot replace the economy. And while their next moves will become increasingly exotic and aggressive, it will without a doubt at least come with long term scarring on the economy, if not outright damage upon implementation. Liquidity cannot replace solvency, and that\u2019s something we\u2019re starting to notice in such places as delinquency rates across CMBS\u2019s. \n\nAnd wall street will finally have \u2018fundamentals reassert\u2019 as second quarter results come in with expectations grim as the hospitals overwhelmed with foolish policies playing out in real time.\n\nBut let\u2019s make one thing clear: New York proved that if we had simply waited an extra few weeks, been diligent with social distancing, and bothered to wear a mask we would be in a true recovery summer where businesses would have an opportunity to take in enough money to make through a long winter. That\u2019s not going to be the case anymore through the summer. Long dated puts are all but guaranteed at this point.\n\nSo, what are the moves??\nFirst, get the FUCK out of cruise lines and airlines if you\u2019re still in. You made a lot of money defying everyone with the stock going up, congratulations. Take profits. Don\u2019t be an idiot. Tourism and travel will come back, but not before summer \u201921 at the earliest, and many of the companies we know today won\u2019t be around to take reservations. Border closings will be up for quarters at this point, let\u2019s just be realistic about that.\n\nSecond, Vix calls are the way. They are a cheap hedge that pay out huge and can pay for many bullish bets gone wrong in a portfolio. Full blown WSB should consider buying UVXY calls.\n\nThird: Realize that there\u2019s so much credit and debt issued out to risky companies that we may have a serious problem in the coming months with defaults. At the same time this debt has been issued, debt downgrades are soaring. You wanna see the stock market tank? Two sizable S and P companies file for bankruptcy and the market wakes up from its wet dream to realize that stocks, are in fact, the riskiest asset to buy.\n\nI understand that bearish sentiment is usually great for being a contrarian indicator to buy. This is the exception to that rule, as we are not in a financial crisis, we are in a pandemic where half the populous won\u2019t accept facts. This time, the bears will be right.\n\nIf remember one thing from this post in the proceeding months, remember this: just because a phenomena isn\u2019t happening to you, doesn\u2019t mean the phenomena isn\u2019t severely effecting others.\n\nPositions:\nVix calls 9/18-12/15, XLF Puts dated longer than six months, GE puts, APT shares, hedges in renewable sectors, cash, long dated GLD calendars", "created_utc": 1593039021.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hfbbhs/wall_street_bets_its_time_to_panic/", "is_self": true}
