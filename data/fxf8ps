Coronavirus predictions as told by Edgar Allan Poe", "selftext": "You guys read the Masque of the Red Death at some point, yeah?\n\nRich people isolate from the plague by throwing a huge party in their mansion. They then proceed to fucking die from the plague, because of course they do.\n\nSounds familiar? Come along for the ride, old Edgar saw this coming and he is going to help us make stock picks.\n\n$PB\n\n> There was a sharp cry -- and the dagger dropped gleaming upon the sable carpet, upon which most instantly afterward, fell prostrate in death the Prince Prospero.\n\nSpoilers: the cockiest rich asshole throwing the party, Prince Prospero, dies when he faces the plague head on.\n\nProsperity Bancshares is a small company that deals with loans or something. It\u2019s located in Texas, home to such fine assholes as Lt. Gov. Patrick who thinks social distancing is bullshit and is happy to throw the lives of seniors away for the sake of the economy. Most importantly: it sounds kind of like \u201cProspero\u201d and you can buy it on RH. Short it.\n\ntl;dr $PB 40p 5/15\n\nWe can\u2019t stop there. Let\u2019s look further than the Red Death. Clearly everything that Poe wrote was a prediction for the stock market moves in 2020. Next stop: The Raven.\n\n$GILD\n\n> Is there\u2014is\u00a0there balm in Gilead?\u2014tell me\u2014tell me, I implore!\u201d\n>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Quoth the Raven \u201cNevermore.\u201d\n\nGilead is currently riding a wave of optimism around their coronavirus vaccine. They still need to, you know, actually make it and test it and get approval. There\u2019s no balm in Gilead\u2014the vaccine won\u2019t work\u2014so let\u2019s short it.\n\ntl;dr: $GILD 60p 5/15\n\n\n$RAVN\n\n> \u201cProphet!\u201d said I, \u201cthing of evil!\u2014prophet still, if bird or devil!\n\nRaven Industries sells a random array of technology to farms and the government. They\u2019ll also be cackling from the sidelines at the loss of our loved ones, unshaken by the death around them. Let\u2019s go long.\n\ntl;dr: $RAVN 22.5c 5/15\n\nStill with me? Great, let\u2019s move on to The Gold Bug.\n\n$GLD\n\nMr. Legrand gets bitten by a bug made of gold (get it? GET IT?), isolates himself, and goes insane. Fucking quarantine.\n\nNext, he talks his \u201cfriend\u201d into bringing the fucking golden bug with him, rowing out to an island, climbing a tree, and DROPPING THE BEETLE THROUGH THE EYE OF A GOD DAMN SKULL that was nailed to a branch for no reason.\n\nThe beetle marks the spot of a huge chest of buried treasure, underneath some skeletons. I think our move here is clear.\n\ntl;dr $GLD 175c 5/15\n\nI entered $GILD and $RAVN today, and I\u2019m going into $PB and $GLD tomorrow. I\u2019m willing to throw away another $100 on whatever stupid play you come up with, as long as you can justify its inclusion in $POE.\n\n$PB 40p 5/15\n$GILD 60p 5/15\n$RAVN 22.5c 5/15\n$GLD 175c 5/15", "created_utc": 1586381132.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxf8ps/new_index_poe_coronavirus_predictions_as_told_by/", "is_self": true}
