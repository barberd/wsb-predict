On May 12th, $VERU secured a FDA agreement to initiate Phase 2 study of VERU-111, Novel Microtubule Depolymerization drug to combat COVID-19.\n\n\"VERU-111 is an oral, first-in-class microtubule depolymerization agent that targets the colchicine binding site of a and b tubulin subunits to inhibit microtubules and is currently under clinical development in prostate cancer.... Microtubule depolymerization agents that target a and b tubulin subunits of microtubules also have strong anti-inflammatory effects including the potential to treat the cytokine release syndrome (cytokine storm) induced by the SARS-CoV-2 viral infection that seems to be associated with high COVID-19 mortality rates.\"\n\nPhase 2 is expected to commence in the next 2 weeks and last 21 days. So we are looking at a start day of May 26th and end date of June 16th. \n\nThis is the kicker though. Depending on results and status of the trial they are looking to be receiving funding from The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority of the US Department of Health and Human Services (BARDA) and The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency of the US Department of Defense (DARPA) to expedite the clinical development program of VERU-111 for COVID-19.\n\nThis maybe a $NVAX situation where funding could blow this stock out of the water. \n\n$VERU has a consensus price target of $8.25 but was just upgraded yesterday by Oppenheimer to $9\n\nOptions through the May 26th - June 16th dates are extremely cheap and if funding is granted you may be able to buy your wife some girly jimmies so her boyfriend can save a few bucks. \n\n**7/17 $7.50c $0.15**\n\n[Source](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/05/12/2032131/0/en/Veru-Secures-FDA-Agreement-to-Initiate-Phase-2-Study-of-VERU-111-Novel-Microtubule-Depolymerization-Drug-to-Combat-COVID-19.html)", "created_utc": 1589560518.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gkcgu9/do_you_have_a_moment_to_talk_about_female_condoms/", "is_self": true}
