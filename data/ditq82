Roku on it's own is a cat - never dies, always recovers, and always makes you shake your head when you miss out on the pumps. Historically, if you look at ROKU, big green days generally run for about 3 days before it subsides and another pump follows. \n\nAMD - They have earnings coming up soon. Last ER, both Lisa and Devinder were confident on positive cash flow. With the new lineup that was released this year, the numbers should look nice. Especially with holiday seasons coming, the next quarter will be even more exciting for those holding far out calls.\n\nPCG - Well, they are in a shithole. But, the company has everything under control. I hear people talking about bankruptcy without understanding the function of it and how common it is for a company to do this. PCG is fundamentally okay. Gov. Newsom wanted to list the company for buyout and PCG refused the offer, arguing that they will be cover by year's end.\n\nWDAY - Overly bearish sentiments by analyst that really had nothing to say other than the delays. Yes, delays are not great for business, but -20% for an expected lower revenue?
