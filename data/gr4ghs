We have to cut down 3% of staff to begin with. Many directors are being let go\n\nWhy is this bad? If healthcare is taking hit during a healthcare crisis, you bet shit is going to hit the fan. If you think market will keep going up while people lose their job and their home left and right, you're delusional. Sorry, printer go brrrrr is not an acceptable argument.\n\nFact: Institutions are sitting this fake rally out\n\nFact: There're only 2 outcomes to this fake rally: institutions admit they were WRONG and get back in, pushing this to new ATH OR retails is going to feel the hammer of unemployment, selling out in droves\n\nTry to think, who's going to last longer? The institutions with trillions and trillions of AUM or the retarded retails who will sell at the first sight of red?\n\nStrike/date: I'm cash gang ATM. No TL;DR.
