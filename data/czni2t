{"id": "czni2t", "title": "$VITFF An Upcoming Big Gold Junior Play", "selftext": "Hey guys, ticker Victoria Gold Corp (VITFF) is a junior mining company in Yukon, Canada with a sole project, the Eagle Gold Mine. Eagle Gold Mine is an open pit heap leach mine that has literally just finished construction.\n\nThe Eagle Gold Mine is due to pour its first gold bar on September 17th during a livestream at the Denver Gold Forum and it will pour the bar. However, the stock price still has a bunch of construction risk factored in. The gold bar will be poured... their website has videos of the entire mine and their CEO shitposts on twitter. If you want to do your own DD you can, but everything is built and ready to go.\n\nThe stock price is currently 0.47 USD giving it a market cap of 500mil CAD. It has 3 billion CAD worth of proven gold ounces and all of their deposits in the area are open at depth. Their 3 billion proven doesn't even include their new deposit they just drilled which can add another billion ounces. They also have a bunch of other deposits that aren't fully drilled... if you don't believe look at their feasibility reports.\n\nThey expected 100 mil annual profits with gold price at 1250 USD. With gold at 1550 USD.. their annual profits will be 150mil. If we compare that PE with other gold miners then without even factoring in the exploration upside the company is worth 0.90 to 1.50 USD in the next year.\n\nThis junior is highly leveraged to gold price fluctuations... so tendies can be made off of the first gold pour and from rising gold prices.\n\nOnly risk is that it has a bit of short term debt. ~60mil. However... it is already ready to produce gold at 1550 price and it has 2 years to make that 60 mil. CEO and management have confirmed that they will be able to pay this off easily and a bunch of big players in the stock (Kinross, Orion, etc.) are in heavy so there is very little risk of further dilution of the stock.\n\nSo if you like gold and want to make a play even crazier than an earnings play... VITFF first production play for Sept 17th is the way to go.\n\nNot shilling the stock, I've got 211k shares at an average of 0.30 USD and holding. \n\nGood luck autists!", "created_utc": 1567615984, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/czni2t/vitff_an_upcoming_big_gold_junior_play/", "is_self": true}
