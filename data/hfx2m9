UPDATE #3", "selftext": "For those of you looking for an update on FLIR.\n\n**See original post here**: [FLIR: The only COVID-19 play that hasn't been played out.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/heln3e/flir_dd_the_only_covid19_play_that_hasnt_been/)\n\n\nI bought even more July 45 strike calls on the early morning dip today, and I'm glad I did because those have already doubled in value. These kind of gains rarely happen with monthlies. My plan moving forward is to buy more calls at every dip. \n\nFLIR has been consistently outperforming SPY since the LAX thermal camera news came out, and there's clear evidence that upwards momentum is building. This rocket is barely off the launchpad. Today's July call volume was up 6x compared to the average and large order volume (orders of $1 million+ that are indicative of hedge fund buying) was up 8x compared to the average. This is likely why it closed at twice the percentage gain of SPY today. \n\n**As for thermal camera news**: [Yesterday night, the Trump administration designated Hikivision as a Chinese military backed company.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/25/trump-administration-says-huawei-hikvision-backed-by-chinese-military.html) Hikivision is the second largest thermal camera manufacturer in the world after FLIR, and this makes FLIR even more of a monopoly than ever before. \n\n\nThere was some great discussion in the previous thread.
