{"id": "ed0yun", "title": "TSLA - uppies?", "selftext": "I\u2019m starting to wonder if a TSLA call play is worth considering despite the high IV and big run up. While this run-up is a bit fast, it was spurred by a string of positive news. At this point I\u2018m half expecting a short term meme pump up to hit $420 \u201cfor the lulz\u201d and then a fallback.\n\nTSLA doesn\u2019t appear to be at any risk of bankruptcy anymore, and it has high long term potential. Relative value is fuzzy. At today\u2019s $72B market cap, it\u2019s worth more than Ford or GM, but so is the $51B dumpster fire Uber, and NFLX\u2019s $146B is 2x TSLA. Toyota (TM) is at $202B. \n\nRight now I\u2019m wondering if TSLA will act like a luxury good where a strong SPX can carry it to the moon but a weak SPX will drop it into the gutter. But the hive mind here has a lot more knowledge than my little brain. \n\nWhat does your ouija board say? TSLA flat for a while, to the moon, or just staying a little bit crazy like papa Musk?", "created_utc": 1576796122, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ed0yun/tsla_uppies/", "is_self": true}
