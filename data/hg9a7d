{"id": "hg9a7d", "title": "Retard DD for why the market collapse is now", "selftext": "When Americans got their stimulus checks on average 14% of them went directly into the stock market (buy the dip am I right?).  \nOn July 31st federal pandemic unemployment compensation will stop, and a huge number of the people who received it will not be able to find work because it\u2019s so hard to find a job right now especially a well paying one.  I had to start working 3rd shift at Amazon because it\u2019s the only place hiring within a 40 minute drive of me.  So what will these unemployed people who will now not be receiving their weekly 600 dollars do?  Pull their Money out of the market, $30,520,000,000 dollars worth at the 14% estimate, and that\u2019s just in stimulus checks.  This coupled with the fed being retarded and over-inflating an over-inflated market will cause mass panic in the market which will cause people to sell even more until this snowballs so far out of control that even JPow and his magic money printers won\u2019t be able to pull us out of it.  Oh also ronas back.\n\nSpy 290p 8/3", "created_utc": 1593184023.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hg9a7d/retard_dd_for_why_the_market_collapse_is_now/", "is_self": true}
