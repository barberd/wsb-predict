If you want to build a strategy that's more than one option, you'll need to place seperate orders.\" So can I trade spreads by placing seperate orders say to buy the father OTM put first and then sell the closer put on the same strike and date to cover my position? If I try to just sell the put Robinhood tells me that I don't have enough capital to cover it, but if I buy the father OTM put first, will it allow the trade to go through?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, does anyone know how many options trades I have to do to be approved for spreads on Robinhood?", "created_utc": 1578516737, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/elyosz/how_can_i_get_approved_for_spreads/", "is_self": true}
