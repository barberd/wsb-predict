Well that shit is happening all over again except this time it's corporate debt. And they are designed to be safe as long defaults all don't happen at the same time... like some kindof black swan event like a global pandemic ya know? Oh shit. And who's been gobbling down this cheap ass debt? Companies like AMC Entertainment, Bob\u2019s Discount Furniture, California Pizza Kitchen, the Container Store, Lands\u2019 End, Men\u2019s Wearhouse, and Party City. Some were totally are fuk before bat flu. Well $JPOW says all this risk is housed outside of the banks so they're gucci let's keep printing. But turns out banks are lying little shits, are trying to hide their exposure on their balance sheets and there's actually more of this shit floating around than there was of CDOs in 2008. Remember AIG? If you don't just take a peek at their 10 year chart. They're jacked to the tits on this new fangled collateralized debt again.\n\nPositions: nothing open, thinking WFC 10P 2021, AIG 5P 2021 and SPY 240P Oct. I want to dig in and find out who else is exposed to this shit, gonna watch Big Short again tonight to hype me up.\n\nBonus previous discussion on credit rating agencies gently fluffing wall streets balls: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gk93sv/whistleblower\\_wall\\_street\\_has\\_engaged\\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gk93sv/whistleblower_wall_street_has_engaged_in/)", "created_utc": 1591921165.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h7a3bi/mom_banks_are_doing_it_again/", "is_self": true}
