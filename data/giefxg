They stole people\u2019s data on FB blah blah who cares...I was a little concerned about my personal privacy but I didn\u2019t understand the genius of the company\u2019s strategy.\n\nOn elections: They figured out which people could be convinced either way\u2014\u201cthe persuadables\u201d. Then they analyzed their posts and and used personality tests to figure out how to convince them specifically (They called it finding each person\u2019s \u201clevers of persuasion.\u201d) Then they drilled down to swing states and even swing districts and created personalized content and bombarded them in every platform to turn the \u201cpersuadables\u201d in specific districts. \n\nThis is insane for elections but this is really just next-level marketing. It\u2019s the inevitable future. Cambridge Analytica is gone. They made too many waves and got fucked.
