{"id": "etwccw", "title": "Markets and the Never Ending \"Data Dependent FED\"", "selftext": "Fellow Autists, I have some news for you. You may not like it, you may not want to hear it, but Stonks only go up. Here\u2019s Why.\n\nThe whole thesis and backbone of this post relies on one very simple fact that you will start to see if you pay attention. There Is nowhere, absolutely nowhere else, to put your cash into these days. Equity markets are the only place generating any form of reasonable growth these days. If markets get scared and sell off, it will be quick and no more than a 5% correction. This Corona Virus is creating an excellent opportunity to buy into once things settle down and the news cycle finds something else to report. Fund and asset managers have to put their money somewhere. They can not park it in any form of debt securities currently due to artificially low rates, and astronomically high financial inflation at the moment.  \n \n\n*A look At Yield curves and what it means.*  \nFirstly, I very strongly recommend visiting the following website and comparing rates and yields and their difference between maturity dates through this interactive chart. It\u2019s a great conceptual resource.\n\n[https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/Historic-LongTerm-Rate-Data-Visualization.aspx](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/Historic-LongTerm-Rate-Data-Visualization.aspx)\n\nSecondly, as you can notice the yields are both extremely low historically speaking, and the difference between yields of long and short maturities is tightening. Remember when Repo operations blew up over night because their were sooooo many Short dated T-Bills in the system that banks were overloaded and bloated with them. I think that this is a pretty big \u201caccident\u201d if you consider the fact that Repo issues were mostly caused by the FED themselves, but one thing that did come out of this \u201cAccident \u201d was the suppression of short dated T-Bill yields. (Supply &amp; demand) The Fed could buy T-Bills out of the system but that would lead to higher T-Bill yields and the Yield curve is already pretty precarious at the moment, so instead Repo is Here to stay.\n\nAs it is, I would not be surprised to see the Yield fall even more and the curve flatten out dramatically. The FED is acting highly irresponsibly right now and is under massive amounts of political pressure which is causing them to be extremely short sighted in their decisions. The FED would rather shoot itself in the foot later, than finish the race with a stubbed toe.\n\nInvestors are also shorting the Yield due to risk and uncertainty measures. **NO ONE** likes the fundamental valuation of the markets right now. Everybody knows everything is wicked expensive metric wise, but as I said where else are you going to put your money? So these investors buy equities and then hedge or overweight on non-correlated or  inversely correlated assets (See the epic rally of gold as of late)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Inflation and the \u201cData Dependent\u201d FED*  \nNews flash: Inflation is already here. The way the BLS calculates inflation these days is asinine and archaic. I won\u2019t go into too much detail but essentially the CPI numbers are very much a poor metric of modern day inflation. Financial asset inflation is through the roof right now and is projected to grow due to the extremely high concentration of wealth gaps developing. The corporate tax cuts, deregulation, and years of record profit keeping have greatly helped to overweight the top players in the financial games of America with absurd amounts of free cash. Most of the time it\u2019s even cheaper to simply take on debt to fund operations than it is to simply put your cash to use since the debt rates are so low. I\u2019m sure you know this but if you need a reminder, look at corporate debt levels and balance sheets. Again, more money in the system for any class of goods, inevitably leads to higher inflation. There is a considerably slower rate of increased monies in the systems that normal people participate in, compared to the systems and purchases that corporations participate in. Any asset that is not a hard common physical good, a common service, or something commonly purchased by average people, has experienced massive inflation over the past few years.\n\nThe FED is 100% data dependent at this point in time. They want to see rising inflation, but they never will. At least not in the models they use. They currently have a never-ending excuse to keep rates low, and things overheated in the market, and with such political pressure coming from the white house, they certainly will.   \n \n\n*How To Profit:*  \nFirstly, you continue buying equities. Secondly you buy Gold and US debt securities. Everything in this market will trend higher, for the reasons I\u2019ve listed. It\u2019s very, very, unusual to see this happen, but it has been over the last few months, and will continue to do so. Thirdly (and this is a weird one) Overweight yourself on Utilities and consumer defensives. The clamoring for real \u201csafe\u201d equities has just begun. We are in the final stages of this FED made artificially induced shit storm that we call the markets. You can expect to purchase safe havens assets and \u201csafer\u201d equities and receive a premium from their sale once shit really starts to hit the fan. Unfortunately, you have to keep playing bull gang for the time being. There is no way around that, but you can play it a bit smarter than continuous AAPL calls. There is a high probability of a mean reversion back to volatility in markets as price discovery becomes more competitive. Especially once the Curve inverts again. I also expect that this entire market is wholly, 100% dependent on rates and the FED. If the FED raises rates we are done. Full bear market. Everyone knows this, no one is prepared for it. If the Fed cuts rates (which has already started to be priced in based on market polls) we continue along our merry way. At this point in time, if you are a true autist, you should stop playing Earnings calls, and start playing FED meetings and minutes releases. The economic data, the corporate data, the market sentiment, the fundamental valuations, none of it matters. It is the FEDs world now and they know it.", "created_utc": 1579985155, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/etwccw/markets_and_the_never_ending_data_dependent_fed/", "is_self": true}
