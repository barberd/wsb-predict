However, the market bounced to new highs but NOT the Chinese stock market.  That's the key here because the US stock market once again is the strongest in the world.  China is the weakest.  When a bounce does occur, the US stock market is where you want to be long, but I think China may be a dead duck after any bounce.  Oil on that day got destroyed.  It bounced big too.   Everything got killed after the winter bounce in 2015 though.\n\nI'm beginning to think there will be reverberations from this virus that will last for a really long time and affect China's economy very negatively.  Who in their right mind would want to setup businesses in a place where pandemic virus may be ready to kill people?  How many rich people will plan to leave China?  Trump's USA is the best place by far now in the world to go.  All this talk about China being the 2nd strongest country in the world has gone down the shitter.", "created_utc": 1580133619, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/euo91u/august_24th_was_a_big_down_monday_too/", "is_self": true}
