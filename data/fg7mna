According to Ahrefs, [my favorite SEO tool,](https://ahrefs.com/) that pages top keyword with the most searches per month is \"carnival cruise cancellation policy\". It has one thousand searches per month. (\"Cancel cruise\" has zero, \"carnival cruise cancel\" has 400, \"carnival cancellation policy\" has 1200. This is not relevant because Ahrefs calculates volume over a 12 month average. \n\nNow normally I hate to plot these on Google trends because the higher the volume, the better the data. Usually I do this with keywords that have 200 or so volume and its boring. This is usually way to subjective and there's not enough searches for their to be enough data for Google Trends...           \n...not this time. Why the fuck else would there be an increase in searches for cancelling cruises?\n\nHere is my chart, hope you like it: [Click](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=carnival%20cruise%20cancellation%20policy,carnival%20cancellation%20policy,carnival%20cruise%20cancel,royal%20caribbean%20cancellation%20policy) \n\nhttps://imgur.com/hBZJkv2\n\n\nShort everything.
