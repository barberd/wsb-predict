{"id": "h7mcro", "title": "Petition to Repeal, or at least Reconsider, PDT Rule?", "selftext": " I'm trying to get a gauge of people on this subreddit who'd be willing to throw their name on such a petition. I get a lot of \"ThE PDt RuLe iS MeAnT to PRoteCt BabY TraDerS\"-type comments, but I believe the rule to be unjust and discriminatory, ensuring those with less than $25,000 stay down. The whole point of people under $25,000 putting their money in the market is to make more than $25,000, but they are restricted from being able to react to rapid market changes. The best example was yesterday (6/11): if you opened positions at 9:30 EST, there was nothing you could do to protect yourself from the carnage, whereas those above the threshold could limit their losses and convert them to gains by flipping positions. I think FINRA is too out-of-touch with the proliferation of brokerage apps and the fact that the common man can now give it his best shot as well.\n\nAs retarded as this subreddit is, it can actually be quite organized from time-to-time. A petition needs 100,000 signatures in a month to receive a marginal amount of consideration. Even if you have more than $25,000 on deck, it would really help your fellow autists if you would consider signing such a petition.\n\nPlease upvote this post if you'd be willing to sign a prospective petition (it would require your actual name, not your Grindr ID). Please don't downvote it just because you think it would be a waste of time or you don't think the petition would get the requisite amount of signatures.", "created_utc": 1591974375.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h7mcro/petition_to_repeal_or_at_least_reconsider_pdt_rule/", "is_self": true}
