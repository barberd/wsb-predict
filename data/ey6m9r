Now, some of you are confused. I got a call from a gay transgender woman asking me why TSLA goes up and I told him (that's her preferred pronoun) - \"it's all for memes Henry, you wouldn't understand.\"\n\n**Let me xplain how it works:-**\n\n\\-If Papa Musk tweets funding secured $420 then stock will go to $420 in 420 days. Then keep going up because the next obvious meme is $690. \n\n\\-If Papa Musk creates a song called 'don't doubt ur vibe' then the stock stops doubting its place in the universe and goes up. \n\n\\-If Papa Musk is happy and throwing an 'AI party' at his house then the stock feels it's time to party and it goes up. \n\nEssentially, what you have to understand is this is not a stock. This is beyond stock. This is meme.  \n\n*(I just lost more money on TSLA haha because I'm a loser who cannot learn not to mess with Papa Musk)*", "created_utc": 1580733824, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ey6m9r/dont_touch_tsla_unless_youve_majored_in_memes/", "is_self": true}
