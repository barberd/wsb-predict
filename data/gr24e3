Arguably, U.S. sports like baseball are better built for this because of the stoppage in play.\u201d\n\n\u201cThink about baseball, there is so much opportunity to make prop bets,\u201d Robins says, referring to wagers unrelated to the outcome of the game. Outside the U.S., tennis is popular for in-game wagering. \u201cPeople are betting on every point. It\u2019s literally at that level,\u201d Robins says.\n\nViewers of the charity pro-am golf match on Sunday between the team of Tiger Woods and Peyton Manning against Phil Mickelson and Tom Brady got a chance to see DraftKings in-match odds onscreen during the broadcast. DraftKings (ticker: DKNG) offered betting on the individual holes and the overall match, which was narrowly won by Woods and Manning.\n\nThe match was the biggest golf event ever for DraftKings, doubling its previous top handle, a company spokesman said Tuesday. The in-game betting was a major factor, and golf is well-suited to it.\n\nShares of DraftKings were up more than 3%, at $30.08, at midday on Tuesday. The stock has surged about 70% since April, valuing DraftKings at $10 billion, behind only Las Vegas Sands (LVS) in the U.S. gambling sector.\n\nhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/draftkings-ceo-sees-potential-growth-in-in-game-betting-51590510965?mod=article_signInButton", "created_utc": 1590516241.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gr24e3/draftkings_ceo_sees_potential_growth_in_ingame/", "is_self": true}
