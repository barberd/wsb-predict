I started trading a month ago and had no fucking idea what I was doing made some money and then lost it all on MSFT calls. Got yelled at by my wife for being a little bitch and losing money so I decided to become gay yesterday. Got me some far otm 265p spy mar 2. Started riding the roller coaster near the bell yesterday wake up this morning fucking doubling my money did some boys and sells on that same fucking option. Robin hood tells me I'm day trading. Wtf does that mean. I go ahead and just fucking cash out because I didnt do it on time for my msft calls. \n\nAnyways I am a autistic retarded gay bear at least until the beer virus goes away. See ya next week when I lose all this shit.", "created_utc": 1582923383, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fb1gti/i_did_it_guys_i_am_a_gay_bear/", "is_self": true}
