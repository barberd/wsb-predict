I think I can help you help yourself in a few simple steps.\n\n1. Buy some actual stonks. 100 shares. (Can't afford 100 shares of Macys or Ford or some shit? Get a fucking job) Doesn't really matter what so long as there's action in options.\n2. Go in and sell a covered call on your shiney new stonks.\n3. Realize how fucking different that looks, and how you value that option differently now.\n4. From now on, everytime you want to take a position remember that feeling. Ask yourself, would I feel good if I was writing this? If yes, DON'T FUCKING BUY IT. FFS.\n5. Get tendies.\n\n\n Thank you for coming to my TED talk.", "created_utc": 1586827161.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0w0yn/heres_some_fundamentals_for_you_retards/", "is_self": true}
