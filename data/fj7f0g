(corporate groups wedding rescheduled so on)\n\nOur hotel does not have a day over 80% scheduled occupancy in the next TWO months( every weekend friday and sat 100% normal)\n\nThe decision was made to close the remainder of the other two restaurants until mid April. we now only have the restaurant thats 25% of the business in the hotel to keep us up. For anyone that knows anything about the industry, Restaurants run on PAPER thin margins, and usually are in big hotels as amenities to the hotel experience)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEvery manager has taken a 10% pay cut( jokes on them i got a 7% raise plus a 5% bonus not but two weeks ago, also shows the incompetence level)\n\nno hourly employee( 400+ resort wide) is permitted to work over 32 hours, and half of them are to be laid off over the next two weeks or maybe 20 hours max. most of which are pay check to paycheck people who work their fucking ass off.\n\nall the other chefs from out restaurants are all now working one restaurant all salaried employees as cooks and dishwashers to help quell this.\n\nwe are not only allowed to order product twice a week( aside from seafood and some proteins) we had multiple trucks everyday except Sunday.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow for more context this resort is also fucking stupid when it comes to books and finances and run by dumb asses. They are managed like shit and their financier for a bank is a certain German bank who aint doing so hot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nand the final quote after we just heard our hours are going up and pay going down....\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"this is going to get worse before it gets better\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\noh boy. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: The hospitality industry is already preparing for impending doom puts on anything in hospitality, def gonna get its shit rocked in the summer and well see a lot of major ones go under no question\n\n&#x200B;\n\nalso puts on my job 7/17 , any strike", "created_utc": 1584302249.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fj7f0g/the_blood_spilling_in_hospitality_an_inside_look/", "is_self": true}
