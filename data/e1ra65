{"id": "e1ra65", "title": "Free money", "selftext": "OK. Here is how. \n\nYou see all those ~~murder and execution~~ merger and acquisition news . And you think, damn, I wish I bought MDCO calls last week . MDCO buyout price is 85 and it's about 84 now . You can buy MDCP for 84 and wait until execution to get your $1 of gain. You would have to put in plenty of capital now to get the measly 1.5% gain in some distant future\n\nOr\n\nYou can sell puts. March 2020 80P goes for 0.55 per contract.  Sell 10 and it's 550 in your account. You don't put any capital in , it's all against your margin (how deep in debt your broker allows you to go) . Make that unlimited leverage in RH produce some cold cash . Now, not somewhere later. Even with 1 contract , it's $55 on $0 money in. \n\nIs there any risk, you ask . Well, if the deal falls through  (e.g. AVGO buying QCOM ) the stock plunges and you get exercised ( they call it \"assigned\", but you would feel it more like ass-exercised ) you will make analfarmer proud. But seriously, it has be hostile takeover attempt like it was AVGO-QCOM disaster. If it's a love story a la RHT-IBM you can safely read poetry by the seashore.", "created_utc": 1574735385, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e1ra65/free_money/", "is_self": true}
