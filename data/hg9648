Also only 2-3% of us zip codes are considered hotspots for transmission.\n\nPeloton is currently significantly overvalued from the stay at home run up, and though they reported 1M connected fitness subscribers reached in May 2020, I dug a bit deeper and found that through March and April, peloton offered 90 day free trials. We will start to see higher levels of churn as these trials end, as can be seen by decreasing search trends for peloton free trial on Google.\n\nIn terms of financials, peloton\u2019s premium value is derived from their subscription class component. I dug into the revenues and sales/marketing costs in the most recent quarters, and found that peloton has .6-.7% monthly churn on average, which translates to 93% annual retention, or a customer lifetime of around 14 years. LTV=14 times 57.8% gross margin times (98.2 times 4/.886 average annual revenue per user)=3587.51. However, CAC=4 times 154.8 quarterly sales expense/(.886-.712 quarterly increase in users)=3558.6. This implies a LTV/CAC of only 1.008, meaning they are barely breaking even in unit economics over the life of the customer!!!! The low churn is outweighed by the overwhelming sales and marketing expenses.\n\nAlso, I believe peloton\u2019s TAM does not justify its valuation, as there will be decreasing marginal returns to sales and marketing ramp due to the smaller size of the higher income customers they target.\n\nBUYING 7/17 50 PUTS ON PELOTON", "created_utc": 1593183647.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hg9648/puts_on_peloton/", "is_self": true}
