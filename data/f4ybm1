Biggest problem with teladoc is their angry workforce, paying docs too little but they just increased pay rates on weekend consults (I\u2019m an IC for them).\nThey report earnings on 2/26 and based on the incentives they are throwin around and the number of consults I have personally seen waiting in the queue, they are growing tremendously.\nThere is a 30% short stake in teladoc and when the shorts realize how wrong they are about this company come 2/26, they will try to minimize their losses and the stock will take off. It\u2019s going to be a 200 stock before years end. \nMy two cents.", "created_utc": 1581891555, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f4ybm1/tdoc_tdoc_tdoc/", "is_self": true}
