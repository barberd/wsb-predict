I thought why not go on vacation when heading into a recession and an expected border closing between Mexico and the US. which I just found out is happening tomorrow... fuck me I\u2019m lucky, no wonder my flight had 129 open seats 2 days ago and was fully booked today.  Anyway about 18% of Mexico\u2019s GDP comes from tourism and hotels and 60% of their workforce is in the services industry which will likely suffer as this virus spreads. If that doesn\u2019t do it for you, I drove by a cruise ship port and 3 new ships were docked over the past 5 days. Betting some of those people from those ships had it and they were allowed to wonder in the town, most likely infecting others.\n\nI know they\u2019ve gone down 40% so far but they for sure have some more room to go down. Depending on how much they drop at open on Monday (hopefully not too much), I\u2019ll check the premiums and probably pick up some puts. \n \nTLDR; EWW $23P 4/17", "created_utc": 1584775207.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmb8ui/just_got_back_from_mexico_eww_23p_417/", "is_self": true}
