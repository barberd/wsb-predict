Literally SPCE has gotten all the big name financial media names\u2019 attention again today and they will be spamming everyone about SPCE this long weekend, just like they did with TSLA. TSLA had its super moon the next Monday and then we all know what happened after that.\n\nSPCE with probably hit $35, $36 and during power hour Tuesday, all the selling will start.\n\nThis is just my two cents, congrats bulls.\n\nThanks for coming to my TED talk", "created_utc": 1581722783, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f40sep/hold_on_to_your_spce_calls_until_tuesday_afternoon/", "is_self": true}
