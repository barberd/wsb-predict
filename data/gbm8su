You\u2019ve heard of her before and know she \u201cdelivers\u201d. Somehow, your gay ass gets her back to your place after blowing up your tab on tequila shots for the two of you. Its getting hot and heavy. Youre more erect than those \u201cmiddle finger/loss porn\u201d posts on this sub. Work has sucked, this quarantine is getting to you, and this beautiful blonde is making you forget all about it. It\u2019s 3:59am. Youre tied to the bed and cant wait to find out what she has planned for you. She goes to her purse, which is a little larger than the normal one. Wait. What is that. Is that? She pulls out an 11 inch, veiny red dildo out of the purse and spits on it. She takes the wig off. A beam of light strikes your face from the shiny, bald head that appears. It\u2019s Jeff Bezos.... Everything goes black. \n\nPS:  You blacked out. You wake up satisfied with gaping butthole because you find out that you are gay as fuck. Now you can post loss porn on WSB and get all that attention your parents never gave you. \n\nWill keep posting dumb shit like this if people actually like it.
