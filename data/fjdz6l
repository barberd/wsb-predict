{"id": "fjdz6l", "title": "DD TOOL: WSB Sentiment Analysis Script", "selftext": "Just realized that WSB subreddit was about to go fuckin PRIVATE! And I was like - fuck! The fuckin gay fuckin mods probably won't add me to the group even after I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjcdkg/add_me_to_the_list/) glorious post so I was like fuck it; might as well post this for anyone who is lucky enough to be in the group.\n\nI got this retarded idea after reading some post here that showed a fancy chart said that our fuckin autistic community sentiment out performed the S&P 500 by like fuckin 24%.\n\nSo its [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Xt8S1lvhC_HRDaKtt6cKHfHyFxFwewpu). Google Colab script. Should be able to make a copy of it and run it if you have a google account. Not sure if it'll still work once the sub is private (it depends on if u/wsbgodbot is added into the list).\n\nOnce you run the code, you will see a lot of installing and progress bars then a very reassuring message tell you that the script is running. Now I know that ~~some~~ all of you don't have the patience  ~~or the skills~~ to run the code, so I'll post the results here:\n\n    >> Calculated Sentiment: -40.16% (negative)\n    \n    Titles (weighted at 2 points):\n    # of Positive titles: 0\n    # of Negative titles: 1\n    \n    Post Text (also weighted at 2 points):\n    # of Positive texts: 4\n    # of Negative texts: 8\n    \n    Comments (1 point):\n    # of Positive comments: 103\n    # of Negative comments: 242\n\nNow, if you have working eyes, you will see the calculated sentiment (or collective \"feeling\") of the WSB subreddit at the top. What this means is how negative/positive the posts are here in a percentage. In case you didn't know that a minus sign means negative, I added some text beside it to clarify. The metadata (Titles, Post Text and Comments) doesn't matter if you're retarded and don't understand it.\n\nWhat we are fuckin doin here is: first, installing the praw module with pip, then getting data from this subreddit, then we parse through the hottest 25ish posts and count the occurrences of positive words and phrases like: calls, call, green, up, etc. We also count the negative words (it wouldn't be fair if we just counted the positive ones, right?) like: puts, put, red, down, etc.\n\nDM me with any code optimization and suggestions - r/beervirus just hit my city and they closed down the schools until September which means that I won't be flunking grade 8 and I have lots of time to code which is a win-win. [Here](https://github.com/kennychau06/PUBLIC/blob/master/WSB_PUBLIC.py) it is on github if you want to commit there.\n\nAlso: (skip this part if your name is not John) if your name is John, you deleted your YT channel and github account (where you created discord bots), and most importantly - if your old reddit username (without the 'u/') sha256's into 8d9cb1b19c5493e88fed82805eb0916fa38dc15de910a0362d5576c092318bbc, then please shoot me a DM.\n\nOtherwise, I hope you make your tendies and consider donating to a charity [that's not red cross](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffubsn/dont_give_your_money_to_charity_hold_onto_it_and/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Puts on SPY $222.22 6/6/6666", "created_utc": 1584327847.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjdz6l/dd_tool_wsb_sentiment_analysis_script/", "is_self": true}
