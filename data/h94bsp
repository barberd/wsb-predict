This upstart faction has shaken our glorious community to its core. It has challenged the very cornerstone of WSB\u2019s philosophy, forcing us to consider that perhaps there is more to life than just blindly all-in yoloing into OTM 0-day calls/puts and slurring BEARS/BULLS R FUK in the daily discussion thread.\n\nThe recently-discovered Kangaroo market has shown us that there is a third way. No longer must we throw ourselves into the endless meat-grinder of Bulls vs. Bears. There is a way to break free from this vicious Sams\u0101ra and it lies in what might seem like a simple realization: it is possible to not just buy options, but also to sell them.\n\nConsider [the price chart of Johnson&Johnson](https://i.imgur.com/Y31ucyT.png). After recovering from the corona bloodbath, JNJ has been in a Kangaroo market. So how does one navigate such a market?\n\nWell, since April I\u2019ve been selling weekly ATM straddles on JNJ (and other companies exhibiting a roo-like pattern, e.g. VZ, COST, PG). At the end of each week, rather than eating the ITM loss and selling new ATM options (as most straddle sellers do), I roll out the ITM leg into a new leg that is closer to the money as much premium permits so that the roll is still a net credit, while also selling a new same-strike leg on the opposite side (which at this point isn\u2019t ATM, but OTM). This way, when the kangaroo eventually bounces back, it restores my previous ITM loss while still bringing in theta. To hedge tail risk, I purchase multiple far-OTM leaps on each side. Those of you more familiar with options strategies will recognize this as a two-way [calendar ratio backspread](http://traders.com/Documentation/FEEDbk_docs/2003/10/Abstracts_new/Neal/neal.html).\n\nKang Gang is the ultimate evolution of theta gang and it has been my salvation. After [losing -$689k (~85% of my account)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g17zmf/feast_your_eyes_on_my_losses_689k_on_spx_puts/) to the organic\u2122 April rally, I've climbed [from $120k on April 14 to $213k today](https://i.imgur.com/gWip1gv.png), reaping between 1-4% per week in theta depending on how far away from ATM the stock moves. This is what I meant by \u201cI'll be returning to my regular theta gang activities\u201d in my last post, so you can now stop PMing me about it.\n\nI hope this post will serve as an inspiration to those of you who suffered greatly at the hands of JPow and his printer. I also hope that the mods will consider creating a Kang Gang award in honor of our new creed. I\u2019ve been wondering what to do with the 6,300 coins you retards gifted me on my previous posts and now I realize I want to spend them all on spreading kangaroo glory across this God-forsaken sub.", "created_utc": 1592177486.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h94bsp/the_kang_gang_manifesto_a_2month_journey_from/", "is_self": true}
