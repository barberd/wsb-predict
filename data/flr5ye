{"id": "flr5ye", "title": "Shelter in place.", "selftext": "Here's my question for you fine stock geniuses.  And a question that's weighing on my mind.\n\nThese states are implementing shelter in place.  The bay area did it for 3 weeks, but is talking about extending.  Now it's the whole state - open ended.\n\nThere is some period of time that you can shut down the economy and string things along with federal debt and $1k checks.  Say - a month.  If these governors get overzealous and shut things down for, say, until the kids are done with their school year...  the general population is cheering it on in all their hysteria.\n\nDoes anybody have a sense of how long states can do that before the companies don't reopen, it spills into widespread corporate bankruptcies, and some massive, permanent double digit unemployment where nobody has jobs to return to?\n\nI'm not trying to wind people up, I'm asking seriously.  I know if SF extends past April 7, and other states start joining, I'm going to start sweating.  But I don't hear anybody talking about this.", "created_utc": 1584690825.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flr5ye/shelter_in_place/", "is_self": true}
