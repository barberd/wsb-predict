The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 8.4% gain in May.\n\nAll categories increased in May, including a 44.1% surge in sales of motor vehicles and a 29.1% jump in restaurant receipts. Together, those categories accounted for more than half the overall gain in sales. Even with the improvement, the value of all retail sales remained 6.1% below last year\u2019s level.\n\nThe figures suggest that the economy is rebounding faster than anticipated after entering in February what\u2019s likely to be the steepest downturn since the Great Depression. After months of being stuck at home, Americans began to travel and shop as states relaxed lockdowns on businesses. An uptick in the labor market in May and income support for those who lost their jobs during the pandemic helped underpin spending.\n\nPresident Donald Trump touted the strong numbers in a tweet.\n\n>Wow! May retail sales show biggest one-month increase of ALL TIME, up 17.7%. Far bigger than projected. Looks like a BIG DAY FOR THE STOCK MARKET, AND JOBS!\u2014 Donald J.
