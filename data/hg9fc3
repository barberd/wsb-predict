Fitting for a \u2018tard.\n\nLet it be first said that I\u2019m holding shares of STNG, EURN, and a little bit of DHT. I was tempted to buy options, but instead let my even more retarded best friend do that, and have watched his 7/17 STNG 17/18/19 calls burn holes through his future mortgage.\n\nHow\u2019s the future looking for tankers? Is STNG\u2019s debt a worry? Does anyone care anymore? Am I retarded? Is the market retarded? All the above?\n\nPositions - 500 shares STNG @~16, 500 shares EURN@~10, 100 shares DHT @~6.50", "created_utc": 1593184487.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hg9fc3/tankers_gang_anonymous/", "is_self": true}
