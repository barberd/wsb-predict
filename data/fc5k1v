{"id": "fc5k1v", "title": "Current economy as a transfer function", "selftext": "Ok, in engineering we learn about Transfer functions. Take a complex system and distill it down to a black box. You can test inputs and outputs and see the results based on the transfer function of the model.\n\nEconomics is just a massive number of transfer functions that are merged into several final transfer function that is the SP500, DOW, Hang Seng, etc. Each transfer function can consist of any number smaller transfer functions; some of these are highly coupled, some are not.\n\nTransfer functions can be stable or unstable, depending on the feedback method. FIR, IIR, pick your poison. Regardless of the model, when implementing in a real system, you will either:\n\n* Work as predicted\n* Oscillate at a certain frequency\n* Damp to 0\n* Explode to one system energy points (voltage, photons, whatever)\n\nThe bottom 3 results are pretty worthless, as any number of input signals can be interpreted as the same thing and the whole system is worthless. Any large change to the input signal can cause instability and lead to the last 3 results. Oscillation is rare, but should always be considered, but probably not in this example.\n\nMy theory, backed by anecdotal Twitter / WSB / Reddit, is that we are about to hit one of the last 3 outputs of a system, not in a good way. \n\nThe Iran Drone Strike is an example of a high energy, short term event, which can be handled by most systems. COVID19 is a high energy, long term event that most systems will either damp to 0 or explode to one of the power supply rails, both results are essentially the same.\n\nWorse, there are subsystems and phase delays we haven't even talked about. The supply chain is an example of a subsystem that has a phase delay of weeks or months. I request an order from China, they fill it 3 weeks later. That phase delay has been modeled correctly for years, until now.\n\nInjecting more energy (money) into the system doesn't help.\n\nTLDR: We are going to damp to 0 or rail to a voltage until we disconnect the input signal and reset power to the system.
