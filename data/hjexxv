Everything was great cause this was a Roth account and I would owe no taxes.  I felt on top of the world, nothing could stop me....aaaaaaand then I got cucked by JPowell and Brrrrr.    This week I decided i should be more disciplined and changed to theta gang.  Sold Iron Condors on when SPY was 300 at 288/290P and 308/310P to capitalize on the high Vol environment.  Jokes on me though because 10 point swings in 3 days are totally natural. \n\nOn the bright side, I'm young and still have a job and savings.  \n\nCalling TD Ameritrade right now to see if they can get me out of a Call Credit Spread so I owe them less money.  Not sure how this will play out since it's a roth account I blew up.", "created_utc": 1593625044.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hjexxv/well_its_been_fun_never_thought_id_be_one_to_post/", "is_self": true}
