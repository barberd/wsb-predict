The oil analysts online are in disbelief and struggling to make sense of it.\n\n**Any early thoughts?**\n\nHere is some of the commentary from online.\n\n* The USA and Canada have lost the oil war to the Russians and Saudi's\n* That green new deals are now inevitable, we are witnessing the decline of oil\n* The pandemic merely accelerated an inevitable\n* The Federal Reserve may start buying oil (no joke, analysts are already discussing how it would happen)\n\n**How does that even work?**\n\n* It would cost them more to stop producing than to produce at a loss.\n* Storage is full so they want to keep producing to keep people employed even though it is negative\n\nMake from all of this what you will but we are witnessing history every single day during this period.
