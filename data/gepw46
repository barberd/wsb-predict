I've been eyeballing that mother fucker since the morning wanting to hop on the Put train, but wanted to put this post out to get some of you degenerates to ride the train with me or buy calls and sodomize ya boy. What the fuck do I care. Either way I think SQ is going to be a really interesting earnings show casing the effect that the bat flu has had on small businesses and payment revenue. \n\nbUt, iTs pricEd iN. No you slut it's not. Look how range bound she is. It's been pinned in the 60-72 range for 3 years. Anyone that can make a valid argument that this garbage rectangle payment company is worth the same as it was 3 years ago will get their balls licked. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dpvnat4qw6x41.png?width=1345&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe73c0c1302f9bd14af6809914bc7c9fc122db43\n\n**TLDR:** What are your opinions on SQ Earnings today ?
