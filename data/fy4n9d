They have smarter people. They have teams to draft scenarios. Sure they screw up plenty. And they can burn money better than a barrel of WSB autist. But - I watch it. Maybe you'll enjoy it. I do this every night for my reference. I've found these can be surprisingly accurate sometimes. And other times, its hysterical watching the money burn. So use at your own discretion. I normally only rebalance my portfolio based on this data. But there's been a small sample of times it has lead me to some big wins.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore you start reading. If you don't understand delta for options, it would be good to look at some basic options short and long dated. Delta in options here is a great way to tell how far from the $ the options are. A low delta means its far OTM or very long dated. A high delta means its closer to ITM or long dated but extremely ITM.\n\nWhere they think the market is going:\n\n**SPY**\n\nGeneral consensus: Down\n\nMajority of buys today: Puts\n\nMajority of delta: 0-40\n\nBig money: Hedging for next week to go up, long term we're going down.\n\nNotable purchases:\n\n56,000 option straddle: 15 May 265 P ($8.64), 15 May 295 C ($5.15)\\*\n\nMost other purchases were large orders for hedging or straddles.\n\nIt is possible to infer that someone does think the market will go drastically down next week and it could be just a bid on that. Normally hedges aren't so short. But 33k orders purchased 17 APR 225 P. I've seen stuff like this before - this isn't really enough volume that I'd suggest on buying it as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Disclaimer: I use time to indicate this was the same buyer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**IWM**\n\nGeneral consensus: a wash\n\nMajority of buys today: Puts\n\nMajority of delta: 21-40\n\nBig money:  long term we're going down\n\nNotable purchases:15,000 option purchase: 18 DEC 20 120 P ($12.35)\n\nMost other purchases were similar with far out dates.A deep dive into the sales shows a good portion of people unloading very ITM calls.\n\n**CCL**\n\nGeneral consensus: Up\n\nMajority of buys today: Calls\n\nMajority of delta: 21-60\n\nBig money:  Going up slightly\n\nNotable purchases:Just mostly people dumping their under $10 puts.\n\nYou might be asking, why does this retard watch CCL? Well, I personally think these travel stocks are fantastic for watching to indicate the markets sentiment as they get hit first and get hit hard.\n\n**TLDR:** SPY up next week (with slight possibility of tanking), CCL will float around maybe go up, IWM will probably just follow the general market and go up. But 100% sure stocks will move to the right.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: TOS shows options sales is source and the post formatting.\n\nEdit #2: Barchart is a fantastic place to see option data for those not on ToS. They will also email you reports each day or you can download as an excel.
