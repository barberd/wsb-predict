{"id": "fg0pzb", "title": "Why thinking $DIS will close their US Parks is BAD DD", "selftext": "So, after reading constant idiots talking about how Disney will close their parks, I need to tell you all how you are completely wrong and here is why.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDisney parks that are currently closed:\n\nShanghai, Tokyo, Hong Kong\n\nDisney parks that are currently open:\n\nDisneyland, WDW, Paris.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat are the main difference between those parks? Disney ownership. Disney is NOT a majority holder in the asian parks. They recently got 100% ownership of Paris. One major thing that might change Paris is that the government might force them to close. It does not make that much money anyways. The US government will NOT force Disney to close their doors.\n\nSo what happens? If a restaurant worker gets the corona, they will close the restaurant for 2 weeks, deep clean, force workers 2 weeks off at worse, then continue. They will NOT close the whole park down. Does anyone remember the measles outbreak at Disneyland? They didnt do shit. Also, the main issue is that Disneyland and WDW has around 10+ unions. Disney workers have to live in cars because they do not make enough money. The union lawsuits with Disney voluntarily closing will be massive.\n\nDoes that mean they will not close? It is possible, but not as much as you retards are thinking. The only way they will close is if California and Florida forces them to close. With how much power Disney has against them, they will not take any of those actions. Disney owns Anaheim and Orlando. They can do what they want.\n\nWhat about the crowd levels? I am guessing most of you dont live in California and dont have annual passes. I went yesterday, and that shit is still packed. You know why? Because 60% of attendance in Disneyland is pass holders. And do you know what pass holders love? It is when tourist attendance is down. All of the tourist attendance is being replaced by pass holder attendance. If you are really banking on Disneyland closing, you all should do some research and download the Disneyland app and watch the wait times. Radiator Springs is currently 75 minute wait and Space Mountain is  60. They ran out of Rise of the Resistance boarding passes today at 8:15am today.\n\nDo I think you should stop buying $DIS puts? No. I think they still will go down. But people who are BETTING on Disney closing US parks are the people that should rethink their methods. I have been a cast member for 10 years and attendance is rising every year. They increase their prices to keep people away but people keep coming. Their Hotels though are at an all time low at this point, so tourists are cancelling their vacations. But for Disneyland, they make more money from annual passholders at this point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Ownership breakdown\n\nHong Kong - 53% HK Gov - 47% Disney\n\nShanghai - 57% China, 43% Disney\n\nTokyo - 100% Japan (Disney licensed)", "created_utc": 1583783851.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fg0pzb/why_thinking_dis_will_close_their_us_parks_is_bad/", "is_self": true}
