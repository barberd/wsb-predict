And fuck every single diamond handed jerk off who said to short the market because they thought their DD was genius level autism. Fucking faggots.\n\nThis market is for dumb fucks only. If you try and use your brain and trade what makes sense, you will lose all of your money. \n\nThat being said, stonks only go up - here are a few that I think will go even more up, semi predictably. \n\nEntertainment - $DIS, with every theme park that re-opens, stock will rocket. Charts for proof fuckers.\n\nCasinos - $MGM $WYNN all them. Casinos are heavily investing in PPE and are changing shit up so it\u2019s more safe. You\u2019ve seen the videos, Americans want to fucking party. And you can bet your retarded little ass Las Vegas will aim to be the safest place to do that. \n\nAirlines - I like $DAL $ALK $LUV $SAVE and $UAL cause they all at least have positive EPS. Whatever.\n\nEnergy - $XLE has more strength than $XOP. As crude gets more expensive from OPEC+ complying with cut backs, especially with oil trading at $30+, companies comprising these energy ETFs all stand to gain. With re-opening, we all fucking know people are going to be driving more and flying more. Definitely longer plays but it doesn\u2019t hurt to pickup 2021 and 2022 long calls. They\u2019re cheap AF.\n\nLet\u2019s hear some other ideas.", "created_utc": 1590017335.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gnlkq4/stocks_positioned_to_benefit_bigly_from_reopening/", "is_self": true}
