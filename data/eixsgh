Vietnam military spending delayed the start of the 1966 bear market. Ceasefire imminence early in 1973 raised stocks temporarily. Saddam Hussein turned 1990 into a bear. The war on terrorism, instability in the Mideast and corporate malfeasance shaped 2002 into one of the worst years on record. \n\nIn 2018 a partially inverted yield curve and trade tensions triggered a fourth quarter sell-off. The 25 down First Five Days were followed by 14 up years and 11 down (44.0% accurate) and an average gain of 1.0%. In presidential election years this indicator has a solid record. In the last 17 presidential election years, 14 full years followed the direction of the First Five Days. 2018 a partially inverted yield curve and trade tensions triggered a fourth quarter sell-off.
