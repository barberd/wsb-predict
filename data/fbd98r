Was able to buy myself a nice custom embroidered hoodie, tendies, a Corona, and a small treat for St. Jude's.", "selftext": "[Hoodie, tendies, and mexican beer (no virus tho)](https://i.imgur.com/LAm5qgz.jpg)\n\n[St. Jude's donation in WSB name](https://imgur.com/a/q0tIxWp)\n\n[my positions ($3,170 profit currently but with puts still open)](https://imgur.com/a/xt4co1E)\n\nTitle says it all, I realized I missed out on the power weaponized autism &amp; meme stocks have on the markets. So when I first heard rumbles about SPCE I decided to jump in with calls - confident it would tank on earnings, which is why I then switched to puts near the top. My puts are still open, and they were worth a good amount more before Friday. We'll see how that plays out, I expect it to hit $10 in the next few weeks as the normies and boomers realize they've been memed.\n\n\nI'm not positive but I'm pretty sure that if I had sold my $22 strike 2/21 calls on Feb 19 instead of Feb 14 they would have been worth ~$15k instead of the $2k I got (sold when share price was at $28, then it hit $37 the next week) But I'm not smarticle enough to understand IV crush.\n\n\nI remember seeing some posts back when we were a smaller subreddit of people giving back, and I'm a huge fan of St. Jude's so I sent some love their way.
