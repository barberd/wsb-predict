This is the nature of the beast -- the path of maximum pain. In this instance, pain is being applied to early dip buyers. After said dip shitters get bogged the fuck out for their entire accounts, markets will bounce. \n\nSo how do you play it, small pleb?\n\nWith my money, I like macro leveraged ETFs -- because I have a large cock. TNA or maybe SOXL is my speed. For you, perhaps options or maybe a little SPCE hi-jinx ahead of earnings?\n\nOne thing is for certain, the second fuckers commit to being bearish, the Fed or some other government hand will absolutely rape short sellers again, sending markets to record highs amidst the Black Plague and death and famine by locust.", "created_utc": 1582645530, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9c5e2/how_will_you_play_the_oversold_bounce/", "is_self": true}
