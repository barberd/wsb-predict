Investors are no long scared, bond market not scared with credit spreads way down. That is not to say there aren't consequences, as the mispricing of risk will have long-term consequences like lower productivity and innovation, SPY gives no shits about that.\n\nHigh unemployment only contributes to bear market if corporations don't earn money, leading to a death spiral of layoffs and less profits, aka deflation. With Fed dollars in play what corporations would have lost are being replaced by Fed dollars through the Treasury. Why do guys think ecommerce sites that sell fucking t shirts and mugs (ETSY and SHOP and AMZN) are going through the roof, because those unemployed people ACTUALLY HAVE MONEY. There is zero chance that the Fed will suddenly cut this off, look at what happened after 2008, this shit will run for years since companies that hire a lot of poor people but don't contribute much to the stock market, like the entire airline sector, small businesses, are still in deep shit, so fiscal policy will be as loose as bears anus for years, yes even if the Dems win (shit like HEROES act).\n\nWhy short dollar? Rates are near zero but low oil prices and some level of fear is still around holding dollar up. When oil come back, fear goes away, yet rates are STILL at 0, which will be likely, you get something like 2008 to 2014, after which rates climbed back up so did the dollar.\n\nThis is NOT a pair trade, this is a balls deep trade on economic policies.\n\nRisks: printer stops and investors become pussies again.", "created_utc": 1589842248.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gmc7v3/long_spy_short_benjamins_no_brainer/", "is_self": true}
