Let me introduce you to this stock and why the tendies train hasn\u2019t left the station yet. \n\nTL;DR DXCM calls\n\nSo what is DXCM? They\u2019re the market leader in diabetes monitoring technology. They monitor your blood sugar levels via non-invasive techniques (basically no needles or blood involved) and you can track your blood sugar anytime, anywhere through your phone or smart watch. Pretty revolution stuff, they\u2019re first to do it too. If you\u2019re blood sugar is outta wack it notifies you so you can get your insulin pump and get it back to normal.\n\nNot convinced yet? Well here\u2019s the low. I\u2019m a med student, I\u2019ve seen patients with diabetes, every type 1 diabetic patient is buying one of these monitoring kits if they haven\u2019t already. Hell even Karens are buying them for their kids just to make sure their precious angel\u2019s blood sugar are in normal range.\n\nThe number of diabetics is only increasing, so the market for this monitoring device is only gonna go up with it. What\u2019s better is these will be life long customers since the disease can\u2019t be cured. This is reflected on the stock, up 12% in the last day, 18% last week, 21% last month, 40% in the last 3 months.\n\nSo what the fuck are you fucking autists waiting for? Get your sugar rush now and get some god damn calls. The more people buying this stock, the more publicity this stock gets, the more people with diabetes hear about it and buy it. Literally can not go tits up. Get your calls and thank me later, fuckers.", "created_utc": 1581815465, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f4j3cc/the_next_great_meme_stock_dxcm_get_your_sugar/", "is_self": true}
