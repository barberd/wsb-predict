{"id": "he60v2", "title": "Inovio DD - Calls", "selftext": "In late April, Inovio (INO) announced that it is collaborating with the International Vaccine Institute and the Seoul National University Hospital to conduct their phase 1 testing for their COVID vaccine. The research consists of 100+ healthy individuals and even primate animal model testing. The result readout is expected \u201csometime in late June\u201d and so far there have been no announcements from Inovio. Based on what we\u2019ve seen in the past months, if Inovio has reassuring research data for phase 1 of their vaccine, the stock will likely gap up BIGLY. There are only so many days left in June, so the results should come out soon. In conclusion, INO calls about a month out, just in case the results are delayed for some reason and move into early July. \n\n**TL;DR**: INO is releasing phase 1-2 COVID vaccine results by the end of June, calls could be the move based on how other biotech companies performed after vaccine trial readouts.", "created_utc": 1592878616.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/he60v2/inovio_dd_calls/", "is_self": true}
