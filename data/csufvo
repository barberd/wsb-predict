{"id": "csufvo", "title": "Benefit to holding ITM calls through expiration and exercising?", "selftext": "I'm holding four ITM call options for companies I'm bullish on short and long term and considering holding through expiration and taking on the shares.\u00a0 Sorry for the long post, but I'm sharing because I thought my thought process here might be helpful for others and also am curious what everyone here thinks of this strategy (aside from your opinions on the underlying stocks I'm playing). For simplicity, everything is this post is based off the closing prices on Monday August 18th as shown on Robinhood. The options are:\n\nTWTR 9/20 $36C paid $505 worth $610 ($40 extrinsic value)\n\nMOMO 10/18 $29.4 C paid $255 worth $635 ($129 extrinsic value)\n\nAMD 11/15 $28 C paid $370 worth $533 ($185 extrinsic value)\n\nMU 1/17/20 $35 C paid $380 worth $1,183 ($182 extrinsic value)\n\nFor the cumulative position, I spent $1,510; it's now worth $2,961. Please consider these choices (and the\u00a0myriad combinations in between). I could of course sell it all now, doubled my money, sweet, nice rip: $1,451 into my short term cap gains pile for 2019 (not big unfortunately) and move on to the next play. But, as I said, I'm bullish these companies and like the idea of holding more shares, so....\n\nA) sell it all now, buy the shares.\u00a0 Buy doing this I save the extrinsic value of $536 that would otherwise slowly dwindle. To buy all 400 shares I need $15,265, $4,170 (TWTR), $3,446 (MOMO), $3,148 (AMD), $4,501 (MU). So I'd be using the $2,961 the calls are currently worth and needing to pony up $12,304. I don't have $12k lying around and would have to sell shares I have invested elsewhere to take these on.\n\nB) hold and exercise. To do this, I need to come up with $3,600 on 9/20, $2,940 on 10/18, $2,800 on 11/15, and $3,500 on 1/17/20 for a total of $12,840 over the next 5 months.\u00a0\n\nBy moving forward with plan B I would essentially be borrowing $12,304 (cost to take on all shares now) and paying it back in almost monthly installments (9/20, 10/18, 11/15 and 1/17), with $536 total interest paid (4.03%) between now and January. Under A I could also immediately start selling covered calls. Side thought/question: could I do better than that on margin?\u00a0\u00a0\n\nBut they're called options for a reason baby! I don't have to do any of this.\u00a0 I only have $1,510 at risk as of now, can sell at any time, one or all, whether because I change my mind about the companies involved, or about the market or whatever. I can also sell before an IV spike from one of the binary events left to play with (MOMO next week, MU sept, AMD oct, MU dec).\u00a0But for the sake of the upcoming math, let's say I either sell now and buy the shares (A) or hold them all to the bitter end (B).\u00a0\n\nIf these stocks all tank 20% and expire worthless, under B I'd be out by initial investment $1,510 (less \\~$100 as the Micron call would still expire barely ITM). Losing $1,400 (-100%) on a play isn't great. But if I had sold the calls and bought the shares (A), I'd be down approx. $3,052 (and still owe short term capital gains tax on the $1,451 profit from the options adding insult to injury). If they crash further under A that loss of course also grows but under B I can do no worse than down $1,510 (-100%).\n\nIf these stocks end up worth precisely their current value upon expiration, my position will be worth $15,265, and I'll have paid $13,814 to get there under A (a gain of $1,451, same as today, 10.5%) or have paid $14,350 to get there under B (a gain of $915, 6.37% gain).\n\nIf these stocks all gain 20% from today's price, then on 1/17/20 my position will be worth $18,318 (TWTR 5,004, MOMO $4,135, AMD $3,778, MU $5,401 and it will have cost me $14,350 to get there (up $3,968, a 27.65% gain) no cap gains owed and can hold the shares into the sunset. Under A I would be up $4,504 or 32.6%.\n\nConsidering this, I'm leaning towards letting these ride and seeing what happens, with the intention of holding through expiration and exercising. I love the flexibility I receive in return for abandoning the $536 of extrinsic value currently in my unrealized pocket. If after the dust settles the new position (100 shares each of TWTR, MOMO, AMD, and MU) collectively increases in value to $15,857, an increase of 3.87% from Monday's closing prices, I will match the unrealized profits I have currently in the position.  Anything above that is gravy, and anything below that and I have so many \"options\" to mitigate the risk and protect my capital if things go south with any or all of the underlying stocks. I'd only have $1,510 at risk until 9/20, $5,110 at risk until 10/18, $8,050 at risk until 11/15, and $10,850 at risk until 1/17/20 with the potential of guaranteed entry to a position with a cost basis of $14,350 potentially worth well above the current value of $15,265.  As opposed to, under A, having $15,265 at risk from the jump. \n\nAlso, the kicker is that I'm avoiding somewhere in the neighborhood of $400 in taxes when paying $536 for all this flexibility!", "created_utc": 1566286967, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/csufvo/benefit_to_holding_itm_calls_through_expiration/", "is_self": true}
