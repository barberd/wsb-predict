Shoulda known the bartender wasn't just being nice but this sub taught me to trust DDs.    \n    \nBad joke is bad.  Anyway.  My credit card gets lifted and I go to the bank to sort it out.  We go through the motions and they tell me the card I have has been cancelled and a new card will arrive in 2 weeks and I will have to activate it to get this new card up and running.     \n    \nWell I hadn't taken two steps out of the bank when I get a notification.  Apple Pay on my phone already has the new card number and its ready for use.  I tested it last night and it really works.  Apple can replace your credit card faster than the bank the card is coming from.\n\nEventually Tim Apple is just going to launch iLife: For $1500 a month, Apple just takes care of your whole life.  iPhone, Macbook Air, Subscriptions to all of Apple's services, and Apple Credit Card coupled with their scary efficient Apple Wallet system.  \n    \nAnd you can bet $BECKY is gunna be all over that shit.", "created_utc": 1576593659, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ebwm3p/ilife_is_coming_for_becky/", "is_self": true}
