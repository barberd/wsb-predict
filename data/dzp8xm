{"id": "dzp8xm", "title": "Cheap Short: Eagle Point Credit ($ECC)", "selftext": "I've discussed this short in a couple of threads but wanted to spell this out in detail for the benefit of the rest of you long-term bear chads:\n\nEagle Point Credit (NYSE: $ECC) is a closed-end investment company that invests 90%+ of its capital in the equity tranches of collateralized loan obligations (CLO). A CLO is a security made up of bundled leveraged loans, which are high-risk, dogshit-grade bank loans taken by companies otherwise shut out of access to corporate credit. The *equity tranches* of CLOs are those that receive higher promised payouts in exchange for being the first to take on defaults and losses when borrowers miss their payments. This fund has no meaningful diversification. In the case of a general downturn, defaults will inevitably rise, and investors like $ECC are first in line to suffer as a result. CCC-rated spreads are already rising, meaning that the appetite for buying more of these dogshit loans is starting to decline.\n\n* $ECC is already down to 14.18 from its 2017 highs of 21.18.\n* Only \\~3% of the total float is short at the moment, meaning very cheap short interest. (No, there are no options for this stock, which hurts my heart every day.)\n* $ECC was down -2.79% in October, and continues to [under-perform the S&amp;P](http://www.eaglepointcreditcompany.com/documents/FG/eaglepoint/ir/600566_ECC_Monthly_Portfolio_Update_October_2019.FINAL.pdf), making it unattractive even without a downturn.\n* $ECC overstates its returns by [pointing to \"recurring cash flows\"](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:vf4E__HIpjgJ:https://seekingalpha.com/article/4298528-digging-ecc-performance-clo-equitys-true-return+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us) of up to 20% when in reality its existing returns on some CLOs it holds are negative, others sit at a paltry \\~4%.\n* Leveraged loans are floating rate instruments, which means that they pay out less as central banks lower rates. Even junk bonds are more attractive in a declining rates environment, and they are often less risky.\n* More generally, \\~80% of leveraged loans are now covenant-lite, which means the value of the loans will be even lower than would typically be expected in the case of defaults, downgrades, and a general recession.\n\nIn a recession, all of Eagle Point's investments will simultaneously take losses as defaults skyrocket. It is literally first in line to eat this losses and pad the wallets of investors higher up in the CLO structure. The company has no portfolio diversification to protect itself. The value of its nominal assets ($500 mil) will crater, while its debt ($200 mil) will turn into a massive overhang. Bankruptcy is in the cards for this guy.\n\n**tl;dr: Eagle Point is going bankrupt in the next recession, the stock is going to zero. If you're happy with a mere 100% return short this bad boy on the cheap.**", "created_utc": 1574367637, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dzp8xm/cheap_short_eagle_point_credit_ecc/", "is_self": true}
