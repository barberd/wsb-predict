I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 9th, 2019.\n\n# **Stocks look to reclaim their all-time highs in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/06/stocks-look-to-reclaim-their-all-time-highs-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks will look to build on their strong recent momentum and reclaim their record highs next week amid a slew of economic data while trade war fears decrease.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is about 1.6% from an intraday record reached on July 26 after notching back-to-back weekly gains. The broad index is up 1.8% this past week after surging 2.8% in the last week of August.\n*****\n&gt; Wall Street\u2019s move toward all-time highs comes as recent U.S. economic data suggests a recession may not be in the cards, and the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates later this month. Easing fears around the U.S.-China trade war are also lifting investor sentiment. If the data remains solid, Fed rate cut expectations stay high and U.S.-China trade tensions lower, the market could climb back to all-time highs.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYou cannot sell the market ahead of the Fed and you cannot sell the market ahead of the trade talks in October,\u201d Steve Grasso, director of institutional sales at Stuart Frankel and a CNBC contributor, told \u201cPower Lunch.\u201d \u201cFor now, it\u2019s a bull run.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The U.S. services sector grew at a faster rate than expected in August, the Institute for Supply Management said Thursday. The data offset worries from the manufacturing sector. The ISM said Tuesday that the U.S. manufacturing sector contracted for the first time since early 2016.\n*****\n&gt; Meanwhile, the Labor Department on Friday reported better-than-expected U.S. wage growth for August at a time when consumer spending is strong. However, the report also showed jobs growth slowed for a third straight month.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe U.S. economy should avoid recession,\u201d Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC, wrote in a note. \u201cWith slower, but still-solid job gains and good wage growth, households will continue to spend; consumer spending accounts for almost 70 percent of the U.S. economy.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Investors will get more information on the state of the consumer next Friday with the release of August retail sales and a preliminary look at September consumer sentiment. Positive data on that front could lift stocks to their records.\n*****\n&gt; Next week will be important as investors get more clues about the Federal Reserve\u2019s next policy move. August readings for the producer and consumer price indexes are scheduled for release Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed has cited persistently low inflation as one of the reasons for easing monetary policy in the U.S. In July, the Fed cut rates by 25 basis points. Market expectations for another quarter-point rate trim in September are at 93.5%, according to the CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool.\n*****\n&gt; However, stronger-than-expected inflation could raise questions about whether the Fed will reduce rates later this month.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAnything that is speaking directly to inflation is going to be most important\u201d for the market, said James Masserio, co-head of equities in the Americas at Societe Generale. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be weighted most heavily in the central bank\u2019s monetary policy decision-making process.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cRight now, all asset classes are being greatly influenced by the expectations of changes in monetary policy,\u201d Masserio said.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed is not slated to meet until the week of Sept. 17, but the European Central Bank will announce its latest monetary policy decision on Thursday. The ECB is largely expected to cut rates with some experts forecasting a restart to its quantitative easing program.\n*****\n&gt; News around U.S.-China trade talks will continue to play a role in the market next week as investors look for signs of progress in the negotiations. On Thursday, China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce said Chinese trade officials will meet their U.S. counterparts in Washington next month.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf there\u2019s a bit more optimism around trade, I think we could get back to those previous highs,\u201d said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. \u201cWe\u2019re not far from the previous highs. It wouldn\u2019t take much to get there.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/YsQnXZn.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/sX8O53y.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/pRadP2c.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/n58wHr0.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/RzO5sS1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/sGZ9twy.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/tZz2aYr.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cy5eP4U.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/6QocBLO.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/hvkoLOR.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/GEvuXFN.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/xcolzVE.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/3vx2uBB.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/v2KnlHv.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Meager \u201cWorst Months\u201d Gains Still the Norm in Pre-Election Years\n\n&gt; With a little more than four months of DJIA\u2019s and S&amp;P 500 \u201cWorst Six Months\u201d already completed, the markets performance thus far has been lackluster and in line with historical averages. NASDAQ\u2019s \u201cWorst Four Months\u201d (July through October) has been similar to DJIA and S&amp;P 500. From the close on April 30 through yesterday\u2019s close, DJIA gained just 0.51%, S&amp;P 500 1.02%. From the end of June NASDAQ has gained 1.38%.\n\n&gt; These are rather slim returns for the amount of time. And this excludes the volatility the market experienced in May and again in August. At their respective lows during late May and early June DJIA and S&amp;P 500 were down over 6%. At the August low, NASDAQ was off nearly 3.5%. Our Seasonal Switching Strategy exited DJIA and S&amp;P 500 positions on May 2 and rotated into bond positions. Those bond positions were up an average of 10.1%, excluding dividends on September 4.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9c542b81f4743043d9709581a6e394e4/3474d6cadf58444a-a5/s400x600/df0face21d09f439629ce6dbca3edbf884cdbbac.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 9/6/19\n\n&gt; Despite a shortened week from the Labor Day holiday, there was a heavy slate of economic data with a total of 30 releases. Half of these came in better than estimates or the prior period's reading while another 13 missed or weakened. Three indicators were in line with estimates. There was a lot of manufacturing data this week including readings from Markit and the ISM, Factory Orders, Durable Goods, and Capital Goods. The ISM reading was the most strikingly negative of these as it showed a contractionary reading. The ISM and Markit service counterparts, on the other hand, showed healthier levels, but the Markit PMI did miss estimates. Labor data also was a major focus this week and the overall results were pretty mixed. ISM employment, initial jobless claims, and today's NFP report all disappointed, but the ADP employment change, continuing claims, and labor force participation rate came in stronger than expected. Similarly, each indicator for wages including quarterly unit labor costs and average earnings showed improvements.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/090619-Eco.png))**\n\n&gt; It will be slightly less busy next week with only 24 releases scheduled. Following up on this week's labor data, the JOLTS report is due out Tuesday morning and is expected to show fewer job openings than June. Inflation indicators like PPI, CPI, and export and import prices make up a considerable portion of next week's data. Core estimates for both PPI and CPI are forecasted to show higher price inflation in August. In addition to preliminary consumer sentiment, on Friday we will also get a reading on retail sales for August. For both core and headline readings, this indicator is expected to slow significantly MoM compared to July.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/090619-Eco2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Economic Surprise Index Turns Positive\n\n&gt; When it comes to economic reports, one trend that has seemingly been in place all year is that the vast majority of data points have come in short of expectations. The fact that economic momentum has been slowing is one thing, but when the economy consistently comes up short relative to expectations, it sets a tone that things are quickly deteriorating. That's never a good thing, but thankfully, there are signs that the tide is turning.\n\n&gt; The Citi Economic Surprise Index measures the pace at which economic indicators are coming in ahead of or below consensus forecasts. When the index is negative, it means that the majority of reports are coming in below expectations, while a positive reading indicates that most data is coming in ahead of expectations. The chart below shows the index going back to 2003, and the parts where the line is red indicate periods where the index was negative for at least 100 trading days. The most recent period of negative readings was one of the longest ever at 140 trading days and just the 6th streak of 100 or more trading days (during the period from 2015 to 2016 there were actually two separate streaks although it looks like just one long streak in the chart). The fact that this index is now positive indicates that economists have finally ratcheted down estimates enough to be in line with actual conditions on the ground.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/090619-Citi-Surprise-Index.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Sentiment Back to Normal\n\n&gt; Bullish investor sentiment as measured by AAII's sentiment survey rose 2.5 percentage points to 28.64% this week. While this is an improvement, bullish sentiment is still in the 18th percentile of the data over the past decade. We must also note that the survey would not have captured any benefit from today's news on the trade front and the technical breakout of stocks and other assets like crude oil. Save a tweet or a headline reversing what appears to be optimism given today's positive price action, we'll likely see a bigger jump in bullish sentiment next week.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/090519-AAII-Bullish.png))**\n\n&gt; Bulls borrowed from the bears this week as bearish sentiment fell from 42.2% last week to 39.5%. As with bullish sentiment, this is not necessarily a dramatic improvement as it is still higher than 83% of weeks over the past 10 years. Bearish sentiment also remains the predominant sentiment level among investors as the bull-bear spread is still fairly wide at -10.87 percentage points. Granted, that is the narrowest spread since the last week of July when it was only 28 bps in favor of bears.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/090519-AAII-Bearish.png))**\n\n&gt; The bulk of the loss in bearish sentiment went to bulls, but a small portion also went to the neutral camp as the percentage of investors reporting as neutral grew to 31.9%. While bullish sentiment is still several percentage points below its historical average and the opposite applying to bearish sentiment, neutral sentiment has been pulling back to its historical average over the past few months. Where it currently sits at 31.9%, it is only 0.33% from that average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/090519-AAII-Neutral.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# ISM Services Shows Little Pressure in Inflation\n\n&gt; Following Tuesday's ISM Manufacturing report, we noted the extremely low reading in the monthly ISM Commodities Survey, which measures the number of commodities rising and falling in price. After today's report for the Non-Manufacturing sector, that trend remained in place. In this morning's report, respondents noted price increases in just 6 commodities and decreases in 4. That net reading of +2 is the weakest reading since January. Combining the results of both reports, in August we saw a total of just 8 commodities up in price and 15 lower. That reading of negative 7 was the lowest since February 2016, while the three-month moving average of -4.0 was the lowest since April 2016.\n\n&gt; As we noted on Tuesday, low readings in the commodities survey usually track the direction of inflation readings pretty closely and would imply that the current y/y reading of 1.8% in CPI will see downward pressure in the months ahead. For example, in the eight prior months where the three-month moving average in the combined reading was between zero and negative five, the average y/y reading in CPI was +0.45% while the median level was +0.65%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/090519-ISM-Commodities-Survey.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Low P/E, Low Return\n\n&gt; Most investors are trying to forget about August performance as quickly as possible, but we wanted to highlight a noteworthy data set about the month before it gets too far into the rear-view mirror. At the end of every month, we run our decile analysis of the S&amp;P 500 to see which stock characteristics drove performance the most. One characteristic we look at is valuation, and in August, valuations played a big role in performance.\n\n&gt; Below we've broken up the S&amp;P 500 into deciles based on P/E ratios (trailing 12-month). Decile 1 contains the 50 stocks in the S&amp;P with the lowest P/Es at the start of August, while decile 10 contains the 50 stocks in the index with the highest (or negative) P/Es. Each bar in the chart shows the average percentage change in August of the 50 stocks in each decile.\n\n&gt; As shown, the 50 stocks in the S&amp;P with the lowest P/E ratios at the start of the month fell an average of 11.5% in August! The next two deciles with the lowest P/E ratios fell more than 5% as well. On the other end of the spectrum, the 50 stocks with the highest P/E ratios fell only 0.78% in August.\n\n&gt; You've certainly heard a lot about the \"death of value investing\" recently, and this is why! We have to think that at some point the scales will tip and head in the other direction.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/deciles0904.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Down August, Up YTD, No Worries\n\n&gt; Now that the very volatile month of August has finished on the downside folks are concerned about the other worst month, September, and for good reason. Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year. However, while August was negative this year with the market still up year-to-date the prospects for Q4 and the year as a whole are not so ominous. In fact, it\u2019s kind of bullish.\n\n&gt; Early last month we relayed the historical data on August declines being quite commonplace though overall, years with August declines were quite choppy and not especially bullish. However when the market was up year-to-date at the end of August despite an August decline the picture changes dramatically. In the tables here you can see that after some extended volatility and negativity in September Q4 and the year as a whole has been rather positive.\n\n&gt; Since 1949 in years the market was up YTD in August but down for the month DJIA was up in September 56.3% of the time (9 of 16) with an average gain of 0.76%, up in Q4 81.3% of the time (13 of 16) with an average gain of 5.68% and up for the year 100% of the time with an average gain of 17.43%.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P has a similar record up 58.8% of the time in September (10 of 17) with an average gain of 0.81%, up in Q4 94.1% of the time with an average gain of 5.73% and up for the year 100% of the time with an average gain of 20.21%.\n\n&gt; Since 1971 NASDAQ was up in September 66.7% of the time (6 of 9) with an average gain of 0.35%, up in Q4 66.7% of the time (6 of 9) with an average gain of 4.04% and up for the year 100% of the time with an average gain of 21.72%. NASDAQ was hit much harder in the 1983 bear market and 1997 Asian Financial Crisis than the much larger cap (at the time) DJIA and S&amp;P.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/11affd080dc3074bda7cc20d28db416b/8098d0f184f65935-bf/s1280x1920/88e6f459a076f5fe630090be54d127054bcfc5cc.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/11affd080dc3074bda7cc20d28db416b/8098d0f184f65935-bf/s1280x1920/88e6f459a076f5fe630090be54d127054bcfc5cc.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/11affd080dc3074bda7cc20d28db416b/8098d0f184f65935-bf/s1280x1920/88e6f459a076f5fe630090be54d127054bcfc5cc.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending September 6th, 2019** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-BKwSEXCR4))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 09.08.19**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvZLi6zY51U))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$ACB** \n&gt; * **$ZS** \n&gt; * **$KR** \n&gt; * **$AVGO** \n&gt; * **$RH** \n&gt; * **$HDS** \n&gt; * **$PLAY** \n&gt; * **$GME** \n&gt; * **$CTRP** \n&gt; * **$MCFT** \n&gt; * **$DLTH** \n&gt; * **$LOVE** \n&gt; * **$LMNR** \n&gt; * **$TLRD** \n&gt; * **$ASPU** \n&gt; * **$ORCL** \n&gt; * **$GFN** \n&gt; * **$PHR** \n&gt; * **$WDG** \n&gt; * **$LAKE** \n&gt; * **$FARM** \n&gt; * **$UEPS** \n&gt; * **$PCYG** \n&gt; * **$OXM** \n&gt; * **$EFOI** \n&gt; * **$LPTH** \n&gt; * **$AMRK**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/6QocBLO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/79LDncD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/uWcQB4a.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 9.9.19 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/nhZYUhw.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 9.9.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/MS6SnUL.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 9.10.19 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/eh3v4BJ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 9.10.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/F24ATf4.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 9.11.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/VRRiWqd.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 9.11.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/4IuiYdg.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 9.12.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/B1sYxbg.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 9.12.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/kEJdCSx.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 9.13.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 9.13.19 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Aurora Cannabis Inc $6.08\n&gt; **Aurora Cannabis Inc (ACB)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 7:10 PM ET on Wednesday, September 11, 2019.
