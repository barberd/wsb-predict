Sure, I use technicals in my trading, and I have been sitting here like many of you bears waiting for that double dip, but the fogginess in the market has led me to sit pure cash gang as the clouded market has murkied my better judgement. \n\nI am showing this post because, while I have studied technicals and applied them for a number of years, you can draw the lines a great number of ways. Just as I fully respect u/Variation-Separate , and I do support his greater outlook of $SPY 200, I am showing you my TA to provide a logical devil's advocate to the traditional bear gang. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9sit0ql9a9r41.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=689e0796e061b4604d54d321f423b14c4437671c\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m2ec7l8ba9r41.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7980ea98abdccdce5e7443f54426c9923a8071d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n6y2v2lca9r41.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e3e5dd39d2aef4cbf6719caa2b6caf783134145\n\n**Takeaway:**\n\nAfter today's pretty significant breakthrough, I expect $SPY to trade marginally up over the next 8 trading days, touch that key resistance point at the 50% fibonacci, and begin at a minimum, the retest of the lows around 220. \n\nThink about this logically: the market has been rallying hard because while these next two weeks may be a blood bath, the narrative is that we may be approaching a plateau in NY. This optimism isn't going to flee yet as the market already anticipates incredible death because Trump/Task Force front ran bad news by preparing the market for a high death toll. \n\nMy anticipation is that as the curve begins to flatten, the narrative will then transform to the fact that life as we know it will not return to normal for a long time. Further volatility will ensue as the market realizes that the economy is not going to open up as immediate/easily as anticipated, and the economic data will finally be able to sink in. Investors don't care about the economic data not because it is not significant, but because it flattening the curve is the priority right now. This is my narrative. Might be nonsense!\n\n**I am making this post because technicals can be drawn a number of ways, and they only work until they don't.**\n\ntl;dr - $SPY might go up, it might go down\n\nDon't get burned.", "created_utc": 1586204961.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fw6cyr/beer_flu_episode_vi_the_return_of_the_bears_dd/", "is_self": true}
