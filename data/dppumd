WTI crude is down 0.9%, or $0.49, to $54.56/bbl.\u00a0\n\nIn economic data, investors will receive the weekly Initial Claims (Briefing.com consensus 216,000) and Continuing Claims report, the Employment Cost Index for the third quarter (Briefing.com consensus 0.7%), and the Personal Income (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) and Spending (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) report for September at 8:30 a.m. ET.
