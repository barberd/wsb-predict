(TSLA) products (Stock, Equity Options, Futures and CFDs).  The first in a series of margin increasing steps is scheduled for May 29, 2019.   \n\nTrading accounts holding Stocks, Equity Options, Futures and CFDs should expect the margin requirement to increase to a minimum of 40%, up from its current level of 30%. Please note that in risk-based accounts other house margin charges may increase the margin requirement above the 10% indication. The increases will be implemented in a series of gradual steps over a 10-day period in order to allow traders to adjust their portfolios and/or capital positions accordingly.  As such, traders should plan on the minimum margin to increase 1% every day, starting after the US close on Wednesday, May 29, 2019, and concluding after the US close on Friday, June 7, 2019. \n\nAs the effect of this change is portfolio-dependent, we strongly recommend that you review the impact of this change before its full implementation on Friday June 7, 2019, and arrange to have sufficient excess financial capacity to absorb the expected margin increases and take action, if necessary, to ensure margin compliance throughout the implementation period in order to avoid liquidations  \n\nTo evaluate the impact of this change on your portfolio, please utilize IBKR's Risk NavigatorSM to understand how margin will change based upon the current holdings in your portfolio, as well as to determine the margin requirement for any portfolio that you may elect to construct/test. To evaluate the impact of this proposed change on your margin requirements, please see KB2957 and, from the margin mode setting, select \"TSLA Margin 20190607\".\n\nConsistent with our stated policy, an account that is unable to carry the positions under these new margin requirements will be subject to liquidation in order to bring the account into margin compliance.", "created_utc": 1559831716, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bxhfcm/interactive_brokers_just_increased_margin/", "is_self": true}
