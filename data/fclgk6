BAC is no exception. A rate cut helps the underlying assets perform, but cuts at their core business, making money from interest. \n\nBanks can handle a shit market OR 0% rates, but NOT BOTH. \n\nIf the rate cuts fail to stimulate growth, the banks will be in big trouble. Not only will their derivatives be at risk, their liquid assets will not appreciate. \n\nThe FED is taking a big risk at dropping rates like this. It will force banks to make even riskier investments to make money. It won't happen overnight, but if the market stays in a downtrend long enough and rates stay low long enough, we're looking at a serious shitshow. \n\nI'm holding BAC 18p for september.", "created_utc": 1583192813, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fclgk6/potential_antifed_intervention_play_banking/", "is_self": true}
