If I get in now, I feel like I can make a lot of money to go towards my debt. But I have to get in asap. I ordered another credit card a while ago but haven't touched it. Here's what I was thinking: I buy let's say 300$ worth of spce, and hold it until people believe I should sell. I can pay back the debt and put the rest towards my other debt.", "created_utc": 1582046461, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f5v784/never_traded_a_stock_before_but_i_feel_spce_is/", "is_self": true}
