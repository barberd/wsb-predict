Perfect.\n\nWhy now?\n\n* Look at the fucking chart\n* Earnings tomorrow evening\n* Cheap compared to competitors after factoring in growth\n\nAs for the real world stuff, apparently their advantage is that they ship everywhere. The rural places in China get shafted by the other services. ZTO charges more for all routes, but have significantly better coverage than the competitors. Unfortunately that is the extent of my practical knowledge about that. Information courtesy of a distributor friend based in HK.\n\nClearly I FOMO'd my ass into this. Here come the risks.\n\n* Accounting fraud -> Turns out this is another Luckin\n* Neutral/Bad earnings -> This is basically a coin toss. TBH in line is okay, but seems bad miss is unlikely in this environment.\n* Trump actually bans Chinese equities in the US -> I am fucked, you are fucked, everyone is fucked\n\nSeems legit.", "created_utc": 1589957428.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gn6eyn/coronastock_of_coronastocks/", "is_self": true}
