Their earth science community has quite a bit of power. The USA a.t.m doesn't give a flying fuck and won't demand filtering. But as you know easiest thing to do is to make products that are compliant everywhere. So bet on filtering. Knowles makes the only surface mount RF filters anywhere near this frequency region. https://www.knowlescapacitors.com/Products/Microwave-Products/Lowpass-Filters\n\nRogers corp: They make the circuit boards that support these high frequencies. There will likely be a little bit of Rogers board material in every cell phone. Proof? Here is Analog Devices best amplifier for this region. Scroll to the last page. What do they recommend mounting their part to? Rogers material, see note 2. https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/hmc1040.pdf\n\nFinally: Quorvo. Great product range covering the 5G bands. Why them and not Analog when Analog has a better product range since they bought Hitite? Well I think Analog has their fingers in many pies so 5G won't be a huge part of their cash flow. So Quorvo has more growth opportunity. Macom has a better product range than Quorvo but I recall they have a bunch of other financial bullshit going on. You see Skyworks in the news regarding 5G from people who don't know shit..  they don't even fucking sell an amplifier yet that works over 7GHz. \n\nAlso relevant article: Chinese companies getting boxed out of the US market https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/business/huawei-ban-trump.html\n\nTiming? I don't think these $$$ will manifest until next calendar year.\n\nAnyways, belch.", "created_utc": 1572317838, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dojyu8/im_an_rf_engineer_and_ive_been_drinking_here_is/", "is_self": true}
