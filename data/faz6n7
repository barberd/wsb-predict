{"id": "faz6n7", "title": "LOOOOONG COSTCO", "selftext": "**TLDR:** Costco's price has been battered by the past week, BUT it faces an extreme positive demand shock with coronavirus prepping next month, and among retailers its supply chains are relatively insulated from Chinese supply shortages. Costco is well positioned to outperform; buy and hold.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOkay buddy retards, happy Friday. It's been a loooong week for *#bullgang* ^((pun intended)) but boy do I have the buy for you right now: **COSTCO**.\n\n**All the doom and gloom in the news is sparking a massive wave of panic prepping.** A top post on r/Coronavirus right now is titled [The Reason You Stockpile Food and Basics](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fasigm/the_reason_you_stockpile_food_and_basics/). According to [Subreddit Stats](https://subredditstats.com/r/preppers), r/preppers has seen a roughly 10x increase in comment volume, with the lowest Comments/Day rank in its history (beating the previous low on Sept 26 when [the Iranian president warned a 'single blunder' could trigger war](https://apnews.com/30c612ad70a843b4b40c150789bb53c5)). [**Grocery stores have already been EMPTIED**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCXj8cLhkBg) in multiple Coronavirus-stricken countries, [including Italy](https://www.businessinsider.com/italy-coronavirus-surge-stock-up-supplies-supermarkets-photos-2020-2), [China](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3051737/coronavirus-hits-chinas-farms-and-food-supply-chain-further), and [Iran](https://www.ft.com/content/46084100-570f-11ea-a528-dd0f971febbc). And Wells Fargo analysts are saying that [**U.S. retailers could see some empty shelves by mid-April**](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/u-s-could-see-some-empty-shelves-mid-april-if-n1144351).\n\nSo where would your average Joe go to buy [a pallet of 1872 bottles of water](https://www.costco.com/nestl%c3%a9-pure-life-bottled-water-pallet-16.9-fl.-oz%2c-24-bottles-per-case%2c-78-cases.product.100107324.html), [8 pounds of chicken bouillon](https://www.costco.com/knorr-chicken-bouillon%2c-7.9-lbs.product.100397888.html), or [276 servings of freeze-dried Mozarella cheese](https://www.costco.com/nutristore-freeze-dried-mozzarella-cheese-276-servings.product.100579390.html)?\n\nThat's RIGHT, YOU STUPID SLUTS. \n\n**COSTCO.** As a testament to the demand, their [390-serving monthly bucket of emergency food is already sold out](https://www.costco.com/emergency-food-ark-1-month-supply-390-servings-with-gamma-lid.product.100102033.html). \n\nWait! But what about the supply chain problems? According to Wells Fargo, **Costco's supply chain is significantly less dependent on China than other retailers**, such as Best Buy and Michael's. There could be issues with packaging materials, but that seems like the least of our worries in the face of the coronavirus. Costco [had already begun to move its supply chains away from China for the trade war](https://fortune.com/2019/11/15/costco-tariffs-us-china-trade-war/). When the shortages come, Costco will likely be one of the last retailers to run out.", "created_utc": 1582914480, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/faz6n7/looooong_costco/", "is_self": true}
