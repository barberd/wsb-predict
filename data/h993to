They make sense to me so hopefully they make sense to you.  Put gang FTW until Wednesday when the printers Pow ordered come in.\n\n\nVALE:  Iron ore mine in Brazil.  Brazil is the second hardest hit country in terms of new cases of corona behind the USA, but they\u2019re growing at a way more rapid pace.  They already had to shut down one of their mines, which accounts for 12% of production.  Corona is gonna get way worse there before it gets better, which means they would have to close more mines = less revenue. \n\nVALE $10 Put 12/18\n\nBHP:  BHP Group - Australian iron ore mine.   Australia has pretty much gotten rid of corona, with only 19 new cases over the weekend.. Iron ore is their biggest export, and China needs a fuckload of it as they continue to take over the world.  BHP is the largest producer of iron ore in Australia.  Australia also announced they\u2019d spend $1B+ USD on infrastructure, including the expansion of BHP\u2019s Olympic Dam in a bid to stimulate the economy.  \n\nBHP $55 Call 11/20\n\n\nSRG:  Seritage Growth Properties - Retail REIT that planned on revamping closed down Sears and Kmart stores to rent to high end tenants.  Corona hit, they haven\u2019t filled those spaces with new tenants, and are burning cash to pay back Warren Buffet on a $1.6B loan.  2.17 Debt / Eq ratio and LT debt / Eq ratio.. Negative ROA, ROE, and ROI, Operating and Profit Margin both less than (45%).  If corona doesn\u2019t get handled quick, they\u2019ll have to start selling empty spaces to support their payments to Buffett.  Put/call ratio of 1.711\n\nSRG $4 Put ($0.01 load up) 10/16\n\n\nVNO:  Vornado Realty Trust -  Concentrated in NYC, along w Chicago and San Fran.  Downgraded below $35 by MS and Citi.  Over 95% of their NYC portfolio is office space.  The rest of it is retail space. Wouldn\u2019t shock me to see a dividend cut this year with unfavorable debt / eq and ltd/ eq ratios.  \n\nVNO $35 Put 12/18\n\n\nSEAS:  Seaworld - Operates parks in Florida, Texas, and California (aka populated areas).  Texas and Florida both showing a rise in cases after reopenings.  Seaworld\u2019s financials are laughable with (13+) d/e ratios and unfavorable quick and current ratios.  Wouldn\u2019t shock me to see them close the parks again after just having reopened their seaworld parks on June 11.  Their CLO sold off 25% of his shares Mar 05-13 which was interesting also. \n\nSEAS $12 Put 9/18", "created_utc": 1592196139.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h993to/a_normal_person_trying_to_fit_in_with_the_bears/", "is_self": true}
