There is SO much of the option value tied into the earnings call would this not be an easy way to make some money regardless of the way the cookie crumbles after the ER? With an IV of 123% could you not sell credit spreads of OTM covered puts and even if the stock goes down (which I don\u2019t think will happen, I reckon it shoots up after ER but I\u2019m autistic so what do I know) the IV will tank so hard especially for the 8/30 puts that you\u2019ll still probably make money despite you not calling the direction right? Idk if I\u2019m being stupid or this is instant tendies, pls help.", "created_utc": 1566862001, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cvvyba/okta_printing_tendies/", "is_self": true}
