Still a piece of shit.\n\nHeadwinds:\n\n1) Expired Patents\n\n2) Big bet on Chinese market\n\n3) Added competition w/ zero moat\n\nThis should carry ALGN back down to $140 ish level like it did when they missed earnings.\n\nAdd on to the fact the only time the stock went up was because of accelerated buybacks. They are gonna shit the bed but there is zero volume and the bid/ask spreads  are too fucking wide.
