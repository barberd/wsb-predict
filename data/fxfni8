McDonald\u2019s can\u2019t afford to keep this thing in their stores, and sales are horrible. A big part of their sales are restaurant sales, and let\u2019s face it, people are not dining-in any time soon. Grocery stores have too much of this stuff unsold also. On huge up-days, this stock has performed weakly comparative to others. It has popped way too much in the last week, and is due for a HUGE drop once the markets obviously turn red this week and into next week.
