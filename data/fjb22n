{"id": "fjb22n", "title": "Long Call US Oil?", "selftext": "Hear me out here. Futures are down on a fucking Sunday after the Fed announced 0 interest, and 750mm QE.\n\nThe Treasury has one bullet left in its arsenal and that's bailouts. \n\nOil, as we know, has been taking a shit right after the Saudis tanked the oil market. SA needs to hit $7/barrel to be profitable on crude, while the US needs about $50ish/barrel. The Saudis can sit there and wait us out when it comes to oil.\n\nSo why would I buy calls on oil? Someone ban this idiot who is saying this.. well, here we fucking go cucks.\n\n1) NATIONAL SECURITY. Are we seriously going to let a country like Saudi fucking Arabia destroy the most important god damn resource in this fuckig world. Literally, a country that only likes us because we give them missiles. The United States will need to rely on its OWN supply.\n\n2) Texas.. ok, hear me out here. If oil takes a shit AND the Dems nominate Biden.. theres a chance Trump may ACTUALLY lose Texas if they hit recessionary numbers.\n\n3) US buying up oil reserves. If you think they're buying it from the Saudis, you're retarded\n\n4) calls are cheap. Worst case scenario? You lose a couple bucks.. best case scenario, 2dam00n.\n\nNow wait.. if US cant be profitable in oil, and the Saudis are treating us like a rich guy who enjoys watching his wife have sex with BBCs (and jerks off to it.. obvi) then why in the name of shit would I buy US oil company calls? This guy is truly an autist.\n\nBecause by Thursday Mnuchin is going to announce US Oil as too big to fail. The Government is going to bail these sonabitches. That's my DD. We're going to print money and not let US Oil die.\n\nThat's literally all I have.
