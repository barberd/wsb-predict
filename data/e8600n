{"id": "e8600n", "title": "Cure for a Raging Purple BONER", "selftext": "As a married man, my wife has always wanted a plethora of children so that she can tie me down with a load of debt and ensure she is never left alone. About 1 year ago we went to bed with the intent to go to pound town and create our third tax credit. As we participated in this pump and dump, it occurred to me that I had a golden opportunity with the other item in the room taking a pounding, the purple mattress that supported me wife's knees and hands.\n\nLittle did I know, that my new purple mattress would be the focus of my thoughts for that entire session and every session thereafter. Here I am, with of a smoking hot woman, about to drop a load and all I can do is think about it dropping a load of money on some purple mattress stock.\n\n Last year, thinking I was a genius, I purchased about 150K worth of purple warrants and stock because you know, good sex = good product = good investment. Shortly after my investment, the stock took a dump ( I continued to double down on warrants and more stock). After a year of let down, purple is finally on the up and up. Here is the reasons I invested.\n\n* Purple is an awesome color and it's kind of gay - all the moderators will likely be buying a mattress\n* Purple was founded by 2 old Mormon dudes  \n\n   * In a down turn, the wives can be called at anytime to join the labor force\n   * All the Mormon people will buy one, along with their many many children\n   * Mormon prophets will likely buy mattresses\n   * Real housewives of Salt Lake will likely own purple mattresses\n   * Real housewives of Salt Lake Likely get plowed on purple mattresses\n* Purple is good for sex - Need I say more?  \nThe mattress gets me harder than my wife when I'm on it.\n* While having sex, you think more of the mattress than you do about your partner\n   * I am literally hard as a rock laying on my mattress writing this.\n* Literally you can go tits up or tits down on the mattress as it provides key pressure relief and any women with a shelf of a chest may benefit from a purple 4.\n* Purple got a new CEO - He also looks gay (likely a moderator here)- lots of potential gay male buyers.\n* Purple finally turned a profit - why I have a purple Boner. See Gain Porn Below\n* Purple has a PT consensus of like 12.00.  \n\n   * I bet the analysts laid some pipe on a purple mattress and then began covering the stock.\n* Tony and Terry Pearce are ballers and they have the power of Mormondom on their side. Praise Joe Smith.\n* Lots of Mormon Kids will need a mattress\n\nI would venture to say that the first job in the world was not prostitution, it was bed making, we all know the first prostitute made a nice comfy lay down spot just before getting a dose of baby batter.\n\nWhile you autists are trying to make short term options trades I will be making long term warrant plays as I sit on my purple mattress. I will invite you over to my mansion where we can all have a sleep over on my purple mattress. We will invite Elon Musk so that we can do a late night taco bell run in his TSLA truck.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPRPL and PRPLW are my go to investments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAmen.", "created_utc": 1575871554, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e8600n/cure_for_a_raging_purple_boner/", "is_self": true}
