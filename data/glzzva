I am looking at SRNE options and everyone and their mom is loading up on 2-2.5$ calls but the price of the stock is $10. Let\u2019s say I buy 2 contracts for a strike price of 2.5. can I immediately exercise that option and sell each share for a 8$ gain? lol seems way too easy but idk wtf to make sense of this.
