Please share your ideas/views.\n\n**HEP (Holly Energy):**\n\n\\- At 9:32 AM 4/24, 700 May 15 $2.5P were bought for $0.5 each. \n\n\\- The spread was $.00 bid and 1.95 ask. \n\n\\- Throughout the day more and more contracts were bought leading to a total of 1,800 May 15 $2.5P and 600 May 15 $5P. \n\n\\- The stock is trading at $12.86 as of writing. Someone betting that this stock loses 80% of its value in 21 days. \n\n\\-This move is also quite odd as it represents a volume of 240,000 which is 32% of its average daily volume of 738,000.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter doing some very basic research (Googling the name) I found that this is a small gas and pipeline distribution company that just cut dividends by 48%. I don't really know what all these options activity means but it seems extremely unusual.", "created_utc": 1587749538.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7cn2v/unusual_options_activity_hep_holly_energy/", "is_self": true}
