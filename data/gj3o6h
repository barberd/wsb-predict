{"id": "gj3o6h", "title": "Investing in airline?", "selftext": "Ok so I know airlines can continue to go low. But eventually they'll return to highs.\n\nI'm thinking of spirit airlines. Budget airline that many will take instead of paying premium for extra leg space etc. \n\nPlus it's a domestic airline, and I suspect domestic travel will return to highs sooner than international travel. With large fleet of single aisle aircraft, they can also fly around cheaper versus being like UAL/AAL with wide bodies parked for months ahead.\n\n$SAVE is already down 80% and they have enough cash to survive couple of years. I also like southwest, but their price is too high imo.\n\n\nI'm thinking like 1000 shares. If airline goes bankrupt, I lose $8000. If it goes 38 a share in 5 years, that's $30,000.\n\n\nI also like US airlines more than european/middle eastern ones. Emirates for instance has 600 capacity aircraft's, that's going to be hard to fill. US airlines, which have faced stiff competition from ME counterparts can leverage the smaller 777/787 wide bodies for more point to point travel. Or even 767.", "created_utc": 1589391652.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gj3o6h/investing_in_airline/", "is_self": true}
