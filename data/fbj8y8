{"id": "fbj8y8", "title": "Qiagen DD - \"10,000 detection kids\"", "selftext": "Qiagen (a provider of sample and assay technologies for molecular diagnostics, applied testing, academic and pharmaceutical research) **turned down acquisition offers** by Thermo Fisher (and others?) **in December**. Such a brash move for late December... sort of makes you wonder if Qiagen was aware of some kind of market opportunity to provide sample and assay technologies for molecular diagnostics, applied testing, academic and pharmaceutical research? Perhaps this opportunity might also have a material impact on revenue and the value of the company moving forward?\n\nHere's a Tweet from Qui-gon on Feb 14\n\n[https://twitter.com/QIAGEN/status/1228289198928605184](https://twitter.com/QIAGEN/status/1228289198928605184)\n\n&gt;QIAGEN  \n&gt;  \n&gt;7:05 AM \u00b7 Feb 14, 2020  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Supporting Japan in the fight against [\\#COVID19](https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hashtag_click): **10,000 detection** ***kids*** have arrived. Kits are used for testing cruise ship passengers and travelers from Wuhan. We\u00b4ll increase the production of kits for [\\#Japan](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Japan?src=hashtag_click).\n\n(I guess they sent kids because 0% mortality from 0-9 years old right? They must have had advanced knowledge of the mortality rates. Impressive, if you ask me)\n\nIf you go to the linked article in that Tweet, and translate it\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/veMvd7u.png](https://i.imgur.com/veMvd7u.png)\n\n\nSeems like they have been flying under the radar and this could be a late coronavirus play. The CEO has been interviewed and mentioned testing kits being available in the first 15 days of March. Obviously late to the game, but indications are that may be the CDC's fault who has been mismanaging the crisis - possibly because trump fired the Pandemic Response Team?", "created_utc": 1583011059, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fbj8y8/qiagen_dd_10000_detection_kids/", "is_self": true}
