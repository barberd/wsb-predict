Any good feedback is greatly appreciated.\n\n To help me understand what I'm doing, I feel I need to get better at understanding the market. Though honestly I'm not even fully sure what that means. I'm sure looking at new market highs are an effective indicator. But what else is when that's not happening?\n\nDo I have to look at major indexes, such as QQQ, SPY, S&amp;P, etc.? Would this also include looking through my daily scanners and see what stocks are moving and how much volume is being traded? Do I look on twitter? Would observing any of the above indicate to me that the market is slow, rampant, or flat? \n\nOr does it just ultimately only come down to what I look for and look at? What I'm interested in? And the rest is truly and utterly useless to me? I feel knowing this information can prepare me for periods of good opportunities, times where risks are higher, where stocks will be more \n\nA lot of question marks, I know. I apologize, I'm just tryna' comprehend what I'm doing a little bit better. Fill me in on anything I'm missing.
