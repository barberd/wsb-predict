{"id": "fmgica", "title": "Essential Retail and Petitions", "selftext": "Good afternoon my fellow autists.  We are on the precipice of the largest \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b market in history and we really need to take care of our workers by getting essential store employees higher wages/hazard pay and shutting off nonessential item selling from these retailers to prevent the spread of Covid-19.\n\nI work in retail and let me start off by saying fuck you  to anyone shopping for nonessential items at this time.  Some stores are swamped and can't keep up with volume and they are intentionally putting customers and associates in harm's way by not limiting the sale of nonessential items or switching to online only and customer pick up sales.  \n\nThis is where all of you beautiful autists come in.  There are petitions out there on every \"essential\" stores sub r/walmart r/target r/kroger r/harristeeter r/lowes r/homedepot etc that are simply asking for hazard pay.  Let's go do the right thing and sign the fuck out of them and get these essential people what they're owed, whether it's more money or safer work environments.  \n\nThank you, stay safe, wash your hands, and fuck the Crones of Crookback Bog.  \n\nTL;DR Go sign some petitions to get \"essential\" retail workers what they're owed and shut down nonessential selling.  Go find the link yourselves, you're not working right now anyway.
