They pretty much make every apple product as well as fab tons of other chips eveything from TSLA's self driving ASICs to NVDA's GPUs. \n\nEveryone who isn't intel or samsung needs to use tsmc to get a competitive edge. It's been hitting new all times highs, but im guessing it'll accelerate soon to $60's and $70's.\n\nTSMC is also somewhat immune from the tradewar politics since it's neutral to both the US and China. Tradewar resolution is probably in it's favor. \n\nI expect AMD to significantly ramp up AMD's business as well as they move forward to compete heavily against Intel and their 10nm process mess.", "created_utc": 1572883904, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/drjqy0/tsm_to_the_mooooon/", "is_self": true}
