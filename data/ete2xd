{"id": "ete2xd", "title": "Oil Plays", "selftext": "Been shorting RIG, OXY, APA and crude futures lately. Crude has reverted back to the mean with more downside potential as inventories build, rig count drops, coronavirus puts markets on edge and global supply-demand dynamics advanced towards equilibrium. Natural gas is already in the shitter and there's no sign of it going on another massive rally until petrochem and global LNG/NG demand catch up to the constant supply capacity coming online (i.e. LNG trains coming online). I think there's a good opportunity for companies like Cheniere and bulk liquid storage companies to boost revenues with additional storage capacity required to make up for the overproduction of LPGs and LNG.", "created_utc": 1579889172, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ete2xd/oil_plays/", "is_self": true}
