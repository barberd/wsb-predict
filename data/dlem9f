Look no further than FB, which is up 2%+ today (Zuckerburger claimed to have moved to support Pete's campaign). Thus, it stands to reason that the real drop in the market will come as we near the Iowa Caucus and Super Tuesday and it becomes clear that Warren (and Sanders) are still clearly ahead, next year around Feb/March (perhaps January in anticipation of these elections).\n\nMy credentials: I predicted the last bear market down to the exact month.\n\nAdditional credentials: I chart in my spare time.", "created_utc": 1571730453, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dlem9f/timing_the_next_correction/", "is_self": true}
