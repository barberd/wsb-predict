His new venture, called\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\u00a0has seen\u00a0\ufffc\ufffc\u00a0invest over 2 billion dollars in just the past 2 years - to develop and code\u00a0\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\u00a0.\n\nBefore we go into the details of what\u00a0\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\u00a0is, let\u2019s talk about who\u00a0\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\u00a0is.\u00a0\ufffc\ufffc\u00a0\ufffc\ufffc\u00a0is a visionary. Some call him\u00a0the smartest entrepreneur of our century. He believes in renewable energy, living in Mars, and pushing the envelope of what\u2019s possible. Although his ideas often seem too radical and impossible to many people,\u00a0\ufffc\ufffc\u00a0is proving them wrong year after year.\u00a0He has made it his agenda to make the world greener and bring humankind to new possibilities. Some of his ventures include PayPal, Tesla, Boring Company and now OpenAI.\n\nBut now,\u00a0\ufffc\ufffc\u00a0has decided to partly withdraw from running Tesla and SpaceX, in order to focus on his new venture in the financial sector. That's why he\u2019s acquired\u00a0\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\u00a0.\n\nWhat exactly is\u00a0\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\u00a0?\u00a0\ufffc\ufffc\ufffcis an upgrade from computers as you know them. In fact,\u00a0\ufffc\ufffc\u00a0beat IBM, Microsoft and few others who have been developing this form of computing for years to the punch. This is not just a super-computer \u2013 it\u2019s a hyper-computer on steroids.\n\n\ufffc\n\n\ufffc\n\n1/39\u00a0\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\u00a0Computer Being Built - February of 2018\n\nIf you were to take ALL of the world's computers and link them,\u00a0Q\ufffc\ufffcmAIwould still be hundreds of times more powerful.\u00a0\ufffc\ufffc\u00a0decided to put all of this power to work in a financial technology with the plan of redistributing the world\u2019s wealth.\n\nBasically, to take from the top 0.1% and give back to the 99.9%.\u00a0\ufffc\ufffc\u00a0believes wealth is not distributed well in our time and the problem is getting worse. Although there will always be someone richer and someone poorer,\u00a0the current situation is unacceptable\u00a0\u2013 where the top 0.1% controls almost 90% of world's wealth. He believes he can cut that down to around 20% without causing world-wide financial crisis. So, what exactly does that mean to you, just a regular person? This means you\u2019ll become 2 - 3 times wealthier, and no one except the super-wealthy will take a hit. Sounds amazing, doesn't it? Not for the super-wealthy, but for you \u2013 yes!\n\nOk, the theory is there, but how will it work you might ask?\n\nOverall, the idea is easy. The top 0.1% keep their wealth\u00a0invested in\u00a0\ufffc\ufffcs, and\u00a0Wa\ufffcet\u00a0bro\ufffcs\u00a0trade these\ufffc\ufffcs\u00a0for them. The idea is to beat the\u00a0Wa\ufffcet\u00a0traders at their own game - making\u00a0winning trades\u00a0so\u00a0Wa\ufffcetwith their hoard of wealth slowly but surely starts losing. Just like a poker game, where a new player comes along on the high-stakes table and\u00a0starts winning.\n\n\ufffc\n\n\ufffc\n\n\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\u00a0Fleet of 39 Total Q-Computers\n\nIn order to do this normally, you\u2019d need a better\u00a0\ufffc\ufffc\u00a0movement predictions than what\u00a0Wa\ufffcet\u00a0currently has (virtually impossible).\n\nNow, with the help of\u00a0Q\ufffc\ufffccomputing, it can be done, and it's actually being done now as\u00a0\ufffc\ufffc\ufffchas shown! This is exactly the reason why\u00a0\ufffc\ufffc\u00a0jumped on this technology as soon as he heard about it.\u00a0It's revolutionary.\n\nWe interviewed\u00a0Q\ufffc\ufffcAI\u00a0CTO Daniel Powers so he can better explain how\u00a0Q\ufffc\ufffcAI\u00a0operates.\n\n\ufffc\n\nCan you tell us how\u00a0\ufffc\ufffc\ufffcworks?\n\nQ\ufffc\ufffcmAI works like a team of hundreds of cities.\u00a0We have millions of automated citizens in each city that go in to\u00a0\ufffc\ufffc\u00a0markets, they spend 12 hours a day gathering information. In the evening, these \u2018cities\u2019 come together to exchange and compare what they gathered. Then what we call \u2018kings of the cities\u2019 analyze all information and try to find mistakes in the\u00a0\ufffc\ufffc\u00a0market; by finding a mistake, we can predict the\u00a0\ufffc\ufffc\u00a0trends. Once we have a certain trending topic related to a big company, we analyze if the trend is positive or negative.\u00a0\nIf the trend is positive, we bet on the\u00a0\ufffc\ufffc\u00a0to rise, if the trend is negative - we bet on the\u00a0\ufffc\ufffc\u00a0to fall.\u00a0It\u2019s that simple.\n\nHow often does\u00a0\ufffc\ufffc\ufffcmake a mistake?\n\nDepends how you think about it.\u00a0Q\ufffc\ufffc\u00a0computing is very different to everyday PCs. If a normal computer has one or two CPUs(processor), then\u00a0Q\ufffc\ufffcAI\u00a0consists of millions of CPUs. If a mistake is made, the CPUs analyze the outcome and \"VOTE\" which decision is the mistake and which is the real deal.We are still in the Beta stage of our q\ufffc\ufffcm computer and software, but it\u2019s already showing over 91% successful trades.\u00a0This means that out of 100 trades\u00a0Q\ufffc\ufffcAI\u00a0makes automatically, around 91 will be profitable.\n\nHow much\u00a0\ufffc\ufffc\u00a0can a regular user of\u00a0\ufffc\ufffc\ufffcmake?\n\nIt depends a lot on the\u00a0\ufffc\ufffcthey invest and the\u00a0\ufffc\ufffcs\u00a0they work with.\u00a0Let\u2019s take the regular user who starts with 400 \u20ac and bets 10\u20ac per trade. Over 24 hours,\u00a0Q\ufffc\ufffcAI\u00a0will make around 200 trades based(this is limited by user) on information gathered by\u00a0Q\ufffc\ufffcAI. Around 182 of the trades will be profitable, 18 will not.\u00a0This means the user will earn approximately 3,000\u20ac and lose around 450\u20ac.\u00a0Evening out to 2,602\u20ac profit in a single day. There are some small commissions added by the\u00a0bro\ufffc, but it\u2019s usually less than 2%.\n\nHas any user actually lost his investment?\n\nNo, we have never had a user who has lost more than he put in. Even the worst cases we have had always been profitable in the end.\n\nWhat improvements are you working on right now?\n\nThere are many we\u2019re currently working on, but\u00a0\ufffc\ufffc\u00a0insisted I not share them yet. Stay tuned though \u2013 it\u2019s going to get even better than it already is now!\n\nHow much will it cost to use\u00a0\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\u00a0automated system?\n\nWe don\u2019t know yet \u2013 it fully depends on running costs and where we want to take the technology. But the first 1,000 spots will be\u00a0free \u2013 we want people to help us test it (and make\u00a0\ufffc\ufffc\u00a0while they do so). After that, for regular users, we\u2019re thinking of charging 8,000\u20ac monthly and more than ten times as much for those trading firms who wish to use\u00a0Q\ufffc\ufffcAIregularly across their business. We do not want to disrupt the\u00a0\ufffc\ufffcmarket too much so spots will be limited to 500 trading firms and 50,000 regular users.\n\nWhen will\u00a0\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\u00a0be available?\n\nVery soon. We\u2019re just adding finishing touches and the first members will be welcome very soon. First, we\u2019ll open the doors for small traders - regular people, and only later for big trading firms. Again, the first 1,000 people will get a\u00a0lifetime membership for free.\n\nAfter the interview Daniel showed us\u00a0\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\u00a0in action. It was like seeing a real miracle taking place before our eyes. Daniel\u2019s software was\u00a0making\u00a0\ufffc\ufffc\u00a0on autopilot. Daniel was so confident in his software in partnership with\u00a0Q\ufffc\ufffcAI, that he offered to give us one free membership so we could run our own independent tests, and so we did.\n\n\ufffcAlex Woods, 44\n\nWe took one of our intern students, Alex Woods, and told him to sign up, following each step provided by Daniel.\n\nThe first step was easy - he needed to fill in some details like his name, last name, email and phone number. After the form was completed and submitted, he was taken to\u00a0\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\u00a0dashboard. Everything seemed pretty easy so far.\n\nThe next step was to fund the trading account with a trusted\u00a0bro\ufffc.\u00a0Q\ufffc\ufffcAI\u00a0selected verified\u00a0bro\ufffc\u00a0for Alex. As we were navigating to the deposit page, Alex received a phone call from his personal account manager wanting to assist in the funding and setup process. With the help of his account manager, the funding process didn\u2019t take long, as all major Credit Cards like VISA, MasterCard and American Express were accepted. Alex went ahead and deposited 220\u20ac. Once funded, we navigated to the \u201cAuto Trader\u201d section of software, set the trade amount to recommended \u201dAuto-Optimize-Bidding\u201d for highest profits.\n\nQ\ufffc\ufffcAI\u00a0started making trades automatically in front of our eyes, winning most of them. We left it active for 23 hours and once we came back, Alex already had 2,278.95\u20ac in his account.\n\nInvestmentAssetExecution DateTypeExpiry DatePayout44\u20acUSD/JPY14:01:10\ufffc14.02:1079\u20ac170\u20acEUR/GBP14:15:03\ufffc14.16:03310\u20ac44\u20acUSD/JPY14:07:43\ufffc15:08:4379\u20ac220\u20acAUD/USD14:59:25\ufffc15:00:25390\u20ac220\u20acUSD/CHF15:03:20\ufffc15:04:20390\u20ac88\u20acEUR/GBP15:47:02\ufffc15:48:01150\u20ac130\u20acEUR/GBP16:39:32\ufffc16:40:36230\u20ac44\u20acUSD/JPY17:08:16\ufffc17:09:2479\u20ac88\u20acAUD/USD19:07:09\ufffc19:08:14140\u20ac220\u20acUSD/CHF19:09:10\n\nSaturday, May 25, 2019\n\n\ufffc19:09:12\n\nSaturday, May 25, 2019\n\n390\u20ac\n\nAlex wasn\u2019t convinced. To make sure this was all real and not just some phoney numbers on the screen he requested a withdrawal of 2,200.00\u20ac to his bank account. This was a fast and easy process as\u00a0Q\ufffc\ufffcAI's\u00a0bro\ufffcsare all verified. After 2 hours, the\u00a0\ufffc\ufffcwas in his bank account!
