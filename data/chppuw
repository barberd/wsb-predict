{"id": "chppuw", "title": "NFLX, is the stage set for a buyout?", "selftext": "Alright, so we all know NFLX left a bunch of us holding the bag the past week or so, but I want to start the discussion on the end game for Netflix, and I don\u2019t mean Jan 2021 FDs... or do I?\n\nI personally think that we will eventually see Amazon takeover Netflix because I really don\u2019t know what else NFLX can accomplish that would keep up with the Bezos Bus that is headed to the moon. I really don\u2019t know if NFLX is trying to capitalize on some other aspect of the market, but I really do think the future holds a merger of the two, even though I prefer Netflix over Prime at the moment.\n\nI saw this clip of Andrew Schulz (comedian) legitimately calling NFLX\u2019s decline (at least for this last quarter). He makes a lot of good points about how expensive it is to constantly be adding more and more to the library, all the while most users are only watching The Office, Friends, or Stranger Things.\n\nWith the valuations that both company\u2019s have, what\u2019s the end game play? Any chance ~~President Elizabeth Warren~~ good ole Uncle Sam tries to block a merger between the two companies? What might a buyout look like? \n\nThere\u2019s definitely a long term market for one video library the likes of NFLX and AMZN Prime, but two? Not even to mention Hulu making some serious moves.\n\n[Netflix is Done!](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2hoZbx7k3nA)", "created_utc": 1564070820, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/chppuw/nflx_is_the_stage_set_for_a_buyout/", "is_self": true}
