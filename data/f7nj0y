{"id": "f7nj0y", "title": "Buying LEAPS on CVM", "selftext": "Alright I have been pretty long in CVM (over a year) and I think this year we get the final results for their phase 3. CVM is basically a head and neck cancer drug waiting on FDA approval. CVM phase 3 started in October of 2016 and needs 298 of the 928 patents enrolled to die.\n\n* CVM enjoys orphan drug status = print tendies if approval\n* IDMC keeps recommending the trials to continue = shit is working\n* Lasts patients enrolled were in 2016 = people should be dead by now\n* Unaffected by corona beer = cancer time\n* 650,000 of head and neck cancer each year = stock will be 150+ if success\n* Management keeps buying shares = they confident as fuck\n\nBasically the people enrolled should be dead by now. Since they are not dead then the drug is working. But since its working cvm can't hit its 298 death events for fda approval. Well shit that means more time to get in. Its been steadily creeping up with institutional investments. If it fails FDA then this goes to 2 bucks. If it pass its 150+ and we millionaires. Basically buy LEAPS long term if you can't handle virus scares\n\nHeres bootlicking Cramer shilling for us:  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgA\\_dWmIboU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgA_dWmIboU)\n\nAlso adding more after i get out of MSFT\n\nProof:  \n[http://imgur.com/gallery/kFxlinm](http://imgur.com/gallery/kFxlinm?fbclid=IwAR3Mx24E1EuITUTD6IUwk6ae9pQfUjmdpK8hkr9LzMPAzs2oLEm7T3F7orI)", "created_utc": 1582345609, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7nj0y/buying_leaps_on_cvm/", "is_self": true}
