{"id": "g42m1o", "title": "recently accused of \"not planning\" my trades and \"gambling\" so here is some due diligence for all you heterosexuals fucking my girlfriend out there", "selftext": " Recently I have been accused (not totally falsely) of not having clearly defined plans when I traded and was also told that after not having found vast success within my first 7 days of trading that maybe this whole thing just isn't meant for me. So today I downloaded thinkorswim because I think its a far better platform than what I have been using and began planning for my attack on the stock market for the following week.  Here I have compiled a list of just 3 stocks from my larger watchlist of potential swing trades and day trades for the coming week that I would like to share images and my analyzations of, and see if you all might find my insights useful or disagreeable. So here it goes. (P.S. if you are looking for fundamental analysis go elsewhere, I can tell you absolutely nothing about these companies except their trading patterns, I dont even know what their names are outside of their tickers)  \n\n[IVR \\(10 day 30 minute view\\)](https://preview.redd.it/xpa1geo9rpt41.png?width=1454&format=png&auto=webp&s=cee9f372496132f207051d6ebab73d4893c91802)\n\n[IVR \\(1 day 5 minute view\\)](https://preview.redd.it/xfzwdnherpt41.png?width=1432&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce26fbc3bc6b828a9987481928f0a4862734722)\n\nFirst pick: IVR Volume: 16.2M Last price: $3.69  10 day high: $5.61 low: $1.82 Thoughts: it is a higher volume stock relative to its low price, its highly volatile, not just now but even if you look to before the big drop in mid March, and within the last 10 days it has crossed the oversold and overbought RSI lines 5 times each, and has had many individual days with plenty as well. Currently it has more recented the stage of oversold and is something that could have potential for a purchase on Monday morning, as others on the list are still around their fair value rotation or are nearing overbought territory.  \n\n[TDW \\(10 day 30 minute view\\)](https://preview.redd.it/31jdxwijrpt41.png?width=1415&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b3cf3454a8f3228db2033ecbddf56a8de9e2626)\n\n[TDW \\(1 day 3 minute view\\)](https://preview.redd.it/iycv36iorpt41.png?width=1434&format=png&auto=webp&s=9703cc872df08e87be2e4c883dbe5327b4e99b7b)\n\nSecond pick: TDW Volume: 273.8K Last price: $5.32 10 day high: $8.18 low: $4.86 Thoughts: It has decent fluctuation, stable enough volume, and has gone from approx 30 RSI to 70+ RSI several times within the last ten days. It could have good potential for a swing trade sometime next week given that its once again in oversold territory but also seems like another potential Monday morning purchase for a possible day trade considering its closing position on Friday which offered many confirmation points above the SMA. However, for half of the last ten days it did have a pretty steady period of consistent downtrend and I have no idea if that is something that will happen again so there is certainly a variable of risk involved as well, especially given that it is the lowest volume traded of the three stocks I am presenting.  \n\n[TYG \\(10 day 30 minute view\\)](https://preview.redd.it/7ptbcogvrpt41.png?width=1451&format=png&auto=webp&s=407e63bf5794ee82383319a1589e3d48b03fd17e)\n\nThird pick: TYG Volume: 923K Last price: $3.34 10 day high: $3.87 low: $2.53 Thoughts: It has a stable volume, high fluctuations in the short-term, and an RSI that has consistently been going from 35-41 to 65-70+ over a two day period, and both the short term and long term SMA lines are trending upward, so this could have good swing potential next week even though its currently approaching the oversold territory. Additionally, this one as well had a closed on a confirmation point and could be a good opening day trade on Monday despite its oversold status.\n\nTLDR: call (my wife) for SPY 69(0) \\*\\*\\* \\*\\*\\*\\*", "created_utc": 1587275926.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g42m1o/recently_accused_of_not_planning_my_trades_and/", "is_self": true}
