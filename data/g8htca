Needs to consolidate more this next week and stay within consolidation trends\n\n**Weekly**\n\n* Volume decreasing - what you expect to see in a consolidation\n* onBalance Volume trending higher over the past 5 weeks which means buyers still have slight advantage\n   * This might be the strongest indicator of ongoing bullish movement\n* Huge vacuum opportunity to 30SMA\n* This last week sellers were in control so need to see a reversal here in the next couple of days or the sell off may continue\n* Concerns | Looking at it from the other side:\u00a0\n   * Is this a continuation Pennant? Bear flag? Maybe...\n\n**Daily**\n\n* Ranges have mostly been 3-5 pts with the largest being about 8pts\n* Consolidation clearly happening with a slight ascending triangle\n* 14 SMA Crossover (bullish), although need to watch how this curves very closely over the next couple of days\n* Would expect mostly sideways days with smaller and smaller ranges\n* Cycle seems to be a short boost up followed by days of decline - 4 days up, 3 days up, 2 days up, (1 day up followed by 2-3 days of decline ?)\n* Not shown - But my squeeze indicator study is saying we\u2019re definitely in consolidation - Volatility is decreasing and it\u2019s showing we\u2019re nearing a critical point.\n\n**H4**\n\n* Confirms Daily with a bit more resolution\n* Nothing new that I\u2019m seeing here other than more gradual decrease in volume and more clear seller control over the last\u00a0few periods\n\n**Alternative Viewpoint -** Bearish\n\n* Is that just a big fat bear flag/pennant?\n   * Heading toward what price though? Valuation has already priced in a shitload of bad news and determined price to be above 89, when everyone thought the world was going to end. BA is an institution and supported heavily by the Gov\u2019t and I doubt they would let it fail\n* Have buyers run out of bullets? \n* The company will not come out of this better/stronger/faster?\n\n**Wild cards**\n\n* Could BA have a stock offering which would dramatically decrease valuation?\n* Earning can\u2019t look good, this will likely drop price further, at least in the short term\n* More bad news...\n\n**Volatility**\n\n* What about VIX eating at premiums as the uncertainty continues?  \n\n\nDoes BA come out of this a better/stronger/faster company or do they limp to their death?", "created_utc": 1587920182.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g8htca/ba_analysista/", "is_self": true}
