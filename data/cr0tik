{"id": "cr0tik", "title": "Bryce Harper grand slam", "selftext": "Watching the Cubs-Phillys game tonight. Top of the ninth, cubs lead 5-2, one out, guy on first and third. Relief pitcher is 34 pitches thrown. Joe Madden: \"OH I guess I'll switch pitchers. That sounds like a great fucking idea!\"\n\nNext pitcher throws 9 pitches, single RBI. Joe Madden: \"OH no! Pitching change is going poorly. Better change pitchers!\"\n\nThird pitcher, 5-3, still one out. Bryce Harper at bat, bases loaded. Turn to person next to me, \"Bet you any money Bryce Harper hits a walk off grand slam.\" Next pitch, Bryce hits a grand slam.\n\nFucking sigh....\n\nCalled that shit though. Person next to me freaks out. I immediately search BH in RH. See BHGE. Remember GE is some shit the autists are talking about. Buy 1/17 BHGE call. Can't go tits up.\n\nTl;DR - BHGE calls\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/epkBIFI.jpg", "created_utc": 1565926950, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cr0tik/bryce_harper_grand_slam/", "is_self": true}
