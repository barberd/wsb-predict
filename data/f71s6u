{"id": "f71s6u", "title": "Testing the IPO Market For Some Fearless Trades", "selftext": "At the height of hedonism I've found black box trades to be the best -- the proverbial dream untethered to any sort of business prospect to bog it down. These trades are readily found in sectors that are wholly degenerate, without revenue, and filled with fast money fagLORDS. \n\nBiotech, Cannabis, Electric fucking cars, solar, virus stocks, and IPOs make up the bounty of these trades.\n\nGot a cure for cancer? Sure do -- check out XYZ and sell it after a 20% pop. \n\nI've been playing this fucking game for what seems like 100 years. Seeing this market at its heights I know the best way to trade it now is through recently listed IPOs. \n\nHere is my short list of recent IPOs worthy of your time. I just came off a successful trade in SDGR, so that fucker isn't on the list. \n\nBEHOLD.\n\nPING, CCC, CSPR, RVMD, SPCE (I KNOW), BEAM\n\nI'm leaning towards CSPR, mainly because it's a gigantic piece of shit, producer of sub-par mattresses most likely s front for money laundering operations. Why go higher? Well, why the fuck did SDC go higher -- producer of ghetto braces that fucks up kids teeth more than a punch to the jaw. \n\nI'm presently long PING, CCC, RVMD, and SPCE. I haven't bought CSPR yet and will most likely hop on that shit first thing tomorrow.", "created_utc": 1582240848, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f71s6u/testing_the_ipo_market_for_some_fearless_trades/", "is_self": true}
