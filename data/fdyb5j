The 10Y treasury bond yield is literally at astronomically low levels. What does this imply? The people are fleeing from conventional \"safe-havens\" in search of something even more safe. Smart money is aware of how badly this shit storm is about to get. The yields are a direct representation of consumer confidence plummeting.\n   1. [https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/bond/tmubmusd10y?countrycode=bx](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/bond/tmubmusd10y?countrycode=bx)\n2. Recovered patients have been fucking dying due to the permanent damage that is being caused by the virus itself. No explaining here. Population will take a hit.\n   1. [https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3065091/coronavirus-recovered-patient-dies-china-reports-139-new-cases](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3065091/coronavirus-recovered-patient-dies-china-reports-139-new-cases)\n3. I want to reiterate this point: **the U.S. is putting zero effort towards this cause. The U.S. will literally not even come** **close to their goal of X amount of masks by weeks end. Nowhere near close enough.**\n   1. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-05/u-s-won-t-meet-coronavirus-test-rollout-goal-senators-say?utm\\_content=business&cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&utm\\_medium=social&utm\\_source=twitter&utm\\_campaign=socialflow-organic](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-05/u-s-won-t-meet-coronavirus-test-rollout-goal-senators-say?utm_content=business&cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic)\n4. The U.S. is literally just about a week into public testing and case deaths, and we've already had a **50 basis point rate cut** and banks are **already in search of bailout money.** What does this mean? It's fucking bad. The fed injections and repo will have to come back around soon (specifically repo funding), and some of it will even have to be paid back next week.\n   1.

The unprecedented fucking double-sided supply shortage is unprecedented. There are supply shortages and labor shortages on every fucking end of the globe, and this will cause massive amounts of supply chain problems in the foreseeable future. On top of that, drug shortages (India is done shipping) will be a monumental issue.\n   1. [https://ctmirror.org/2020/03/04/concerns-rise-in-congress-about-coronavirus-impact-on-u-s-drug-supply/](https://ctmirror.org/2020/03/04/concerns-rise-in-congress-about-coronavirus-impact-on-u-s-drug-supply/)\n6. The amount of events being cancelled every day is unprecedented. Not only will these cancellations hinder advancement in certain fields, the entertainment cancellations will ensure public panic soon enough.\n   1. [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/03/05/coronavirus-update-list-canceled-events/4950641002/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/03/05/coronavirus-update-list-canceled-events/4950641002/)\n7. The primary issue won't be the deaths racking up from the Coronavirus (although that will be an extreme issue), it is the fact that hospitals are not equipped for the ensuing storm. People will be body-bagged (check Iran) and sitting in hospital hallways. Hospitals will become a petri dish. The sick around sick will cause immense issues. Imagine you \"recover\" in a hospital, you are surrounded by people carrying potential mutations and variations, and your immune system and lungs are already weakened. You're fucked.\n   1.

The U.S. is racking up horrific death statistics. This could be caused by the lack of actionable effort by the government, the quick community spread, the lack of testing, or all of the above and more.\n   1. [https://tbsnews.net/international/coronavirus-chronicle/coronavirus-where-most-people-are-dying-out-every-100-not-china](https://tbsnews.net/international/coronavirus-chronicle/coronavirus-where-most-people-are-dying-out-every-100-not-china)\n9. This virus is bringing the U.S. inequality crisis to light. People are literally scared of not going to work because they won't get paid. Companies are sending people home with unpaid leave. So many families are living paycheck-to-paycheck. This will fuck the U.S. labor force while simultaneously getting everybody sick AND increasing the evident future homelessness rates as people can't afford it.\n   1.
