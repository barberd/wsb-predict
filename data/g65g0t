Looking Someone Less Autistic Than Me To Make A Case For Puts On Earnings Today.", "selftext": "My retarded ass didn\u2019t go to college but I\u2019m Rain Man enough to have landed a Managerial position with a company that moves a lot of freight via LTL. For those of you who paid attention in school, don\u2019t have a blue collar job and have no fucking clue what I\u2019m talking about... LTL is Less than a Truck Load. When you need to move shit from point A to point B and it\u2019s not enough to fill a 53\u2019 semi trailer, you hire companies like $ODFL to move it with other people\u2019s shit so you aren\u2019t stuck paying for a whole truck.\n\nHang in there my ADD friends, I know theres a lot of words here but my company provides construction \nmaterial to big box retailers for remodels, repairs and store builds. We\u2019re currently doing fuck all right now. Maybe banging your wife while you\u2019re crying about your SPY puts but nothing to do with shipping anything. I.e. not hiring $ODFL to move freight AND even when we were busy we NEVER used these greedy cocksuckers because they were the most expensive out of the dozen or so companies we are signed up with. \n\nNot only is the overall amount of freight moving down because of the beer virus but UPS and Fed Ex have made aggressive expansions into the LTL market over the last couple of years capturing market share. \n\nThey report earnings tomorrow morning. Someone smarter than me actually do some real DD and tell me this is a smart play. $ODFL is only down like 7% over the last 3 months so it seems like they have room fall. I know they pay dividends and boomers love that shit even if the company is a dog and has no growth potential. \n\nAm I on to something or am I on something? \n\nTL;DR $110 5/15p", "created_utc": 1587576719.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g65g0t/odfl_looking_someone_less_autistic_than_me_to/", "is_self": true}
