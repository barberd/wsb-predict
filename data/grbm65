{"id": "grbm65", "title": "DraftKing biggest retard pump ever?", "selftext": "It's fucking sportsbetting, not rocket science, there is literally zero competitive advantage ever. You are not going to find a way to offer better odds and get more money, this shit is solved.\n\nIndustry is cutthroat as fuck, margins are dogshit since you gotta run promos and sign up bonuses to lure people to switch platforms, it is nowhere near Saas, you'll be lucky to squeeze 10% on your take at end of day.\n\nSeen this 150B revenue number thrown around. Supposedly that's the amount bet illegally in US. That's the GROSS BET, net margin in the US is fucking 5%. That nets you 7.5B of sales. \n\nLet's say you max out at 100% market share and generate 20% margin, that gets you 1.5 billion. Being super generous and give it 30 times even though you are maxed out and growth is anemic, equity market size is 45B, and this will take at least three or four years to get there.\n\nDKNG is $10B today, so people are already pricing in a huge market share, fair, since they are promoting to huge existing fantasy sports fans, but there are a fuck ton of sports gambling operators that people are already betting with, what makes DraftKinga better? As someone that has gambled a little I can tell you that absolutely fucking nothing, in fact it's worse since it lacks some features that I use on my original site.\n\nMy guess is that next year their growth rate, gets totally fucked next year, like sub 30% when the novelty wears off for new gamblers and competitors come in.\n\nAlso, the CEO ran marketing for fucking VIstaprint. I mean of course the one thing he knows is to hype up worthless pieces of paper for you to buy \ud83d\udc4c\n\nPuts", "created_utc": 1590548823.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/grbm65/draftking_biggest_retard_pump_ever/", "is_self": true}
