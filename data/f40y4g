{"id": "f40y4g", "title": "NOK Dragon Dicks", "selftext": "NOK has already enjoyed a pretty good run up these past 3 months, but here's why - in my mind - it's just the beginning\n\n##5G Infrastructure\n\nNokia has the unique ability to offer the full range of services, hardware, software to communication service providers. All of this comes directly from Nokia, meaning it has a strong ecosystem that CSP's are locked into. Ericsson offers similar benefits, but a weaker ecosystem, meaning CSP's are more free to mix and match components/software/services when using Ericsson. This is similar to Apple vs. Android/Windows - although android/windows offers greater versatility, Apple has much more power over their consumers. This is how Apple makes money; when you want it fixed, you go to the Apple store. When you need a laptop, the conveniences of the Apple ecoystem outweigh the costs of the OS, etc. Nokia has well established infrastructure, with an ecosystem that locks CSP's in for ez profits. \n\n##The Asian Market\n\nHuawei use to dominate the Asian internet market, but times are-a-changin'. They have no real market share outside of Asia, so if their Chinese contracts are cut they have no support in the 4/5G market. In short, Huawei poses no long term risk to Nokia. Nokia is gaining market share in Asia, at a faster rate than Ericsson. In 2018, Ericsson generated about 1.5 billion USD from Chinese contracts, while Nokia generated about 2.3 billion USD from China. In late 2019, Nokia signed preliminary agreements with the big 3 of China Telecoms - China Mobile, China Unicom, and China Telecom. These are contracts previously held by Huawei, and contracts that Ericsson wanted. Based on this, Nokia is going to be the dominant 5G player in China soon. \n\n##Digitilization\n\nNokia has just announced a new, highly-scalable 5G management software tool. They were supposed to demo this at the Mobile World Congress, but this was cancelled due to Coronavirus fears. My guess is this will be rescheduled later this year. This is a major step for Nokia, and it will definitely be a step ahead of Ericsson's current software offerings. Looking at their 2020 guidance from their earnings, they expect their driving factor to be software and the digitilization of networks. Although the cancellation of the MWO is a setback, it shouldn't provide any real setback to software development. I think Nokia is going to emerge as the 5G software champ for 2020, beating out Ericsson\n\n\nTL:DR\nPick a lambo color, buy NOK 15 Jan 2021 $5 calls and forget about them", "created_utc": 1581723506, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f40y4g/nok_dragon_dicks/", "is_self": true}
