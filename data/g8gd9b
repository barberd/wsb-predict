This is not to throw a pity party, but I find that giving some insight into my losses may help someone else not lose theirs. These will probably be repetitive to most, but i'm hoping to help one retard out of making the bad decisions I've made.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **Over Trading.**  Sure, a lot of you think \"OH I GOT 25K IM GOING TO MaKe So MUcH BaNk!\" this is absolutely not true without a good foundation. I used to think PDT rules were bullshit, until I injected 100k into my TD account and started trying to pick every stock I could think of and play the waves.*Tip: Focus on a few and master the charts.*\n2. **Wealth TRULY does go from the impatient to the patient.**  A lot of money was in the right idea, but in the wrong execution. Once you understand basic TA on charts, you can make a more educated guess on where the stock may head, but you have to wait for it to play out. I sometimes I sell my  trade within 10-15 minutes only to find 20 minutes later it starts to work in my favor. Not to say it works every time, but it's like the ability to count cards in blackjack. You won't win every time, but you have a better hand than the guy next to you.  *Tip: Lower your position size to keep your emotions in check.*\n3. **Understanding the underlying assets for ETFs, and what decay means.**  This is mainly for $USO retards. Don't trade what you don't know. A lot of people see $USO and go OH THAT STOCK is way down and I should invest before it goes back to $10 again!*Tip: Learn about decaying etfs, what the underlying assets are, and what they consist of. Also, stay away from $USO*\n4. **Learn your trading style.**   This is huge because I think most people who are fairly new to investing don't understand their style yet. Are you a day trader? Swing Trader? Long Term Trader? not knowing your style will make you create bad positions. I took positions for a longer term trade and traded them in a short span. Buying leaps then selling them 2 weeks later.*Tip: Understanding your style, and trading based on the style that makes you comfortable.*\n5. **It's good to have guidance and learn from other people, but make sure you do your own homework.**  I lost 10k in about 5 minutes because I saw some fucknut on twitter say \"OH $BA TO THE MOoOnn!\" - played a large position in a short frame. Lost it without recovery.*Tip: You have to do your own homework, in order to get that bread.*\n\nThere are people that do stocks and get extremely lucky ignoring these types of rules. You may be one of them, and good for you. But I hope some of these help someone out there, because in the end - my losses may help some of your gains.\n\nTL;DR - Make your tendies.", "created_utc": 1587915368.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g8gd9b/5_ways_to_lose_your_money/", "is_self": true}
