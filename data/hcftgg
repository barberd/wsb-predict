He is still trying to pump and his boneheaded cohorts are still in, albeit some are getting a little antsy in the comments with this call given it\u2019s performance over the past week. However most are still drinking the \u201cbuy the dip punch\u201d and are oblivious to any sort of TA. To make things more interesting, that page is \u201ctaking the week off Twitter\u201d so no one will be able to say shit when they\u2019re bag holding next week.

If your brokers lets you sell shares short I would hammer this bad boy with a stop loss at $2.10. I think it\u2019ll for sure touch $1.50 next week probably $1.20. Pretty obvious pump and dump to me. If you can\u2019t short sell consider the $2.50 7/17 put. GL", "created_utc": 1592627797.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hcftgg/bears_lets_eat/", "is_self": true}
