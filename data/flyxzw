So go 4p if you want.\n\nEdit2: My all-time http://imgur.com/a/9dC5ykl\n\n\n\nWe all know the current gay market is from corona-chan freezing the economy and pushing for financial meltdown against the overly leveraged autists we call \"institutional investors.\" This isn't any new circumstance that's being taken advantage of, or any new legislation that enabled financial  instruments like ABSs (asset back securities) or CDOs/CLOs  (collateralized debt/loan obligations) to be scrutinized and passed off as \"acceptably trustworthy collateral\". In fact, the MBS (mortgage  backed security) or the CMO (collateralized mortgage obligation) are  just two types of a financial instrument class. Now, corporate bonds of  any and all grades become components to building up these securitized  debt instruments. We've seen VCSH, VCIT, HYG, and JNK tanking as the  price for taking out protection against CDO/CLO/corporate bond defaults  (more commonly known as CDS) has increased by 5% in the last few weeks.\n\n[https://www.ft.com/content/2fb81482-5257-11ea-90ad-25e377c0ee1f](https://www.ft.com/content/2fb81482-5257-11ea-90ad-25e377c0ee1f)\n\nSee, the problem is that *someone's* got to be bagholding these risky ass, expensively hedged debt securities. Large financial institutions unfortunately have more than two brain cells, and especially after 2009 they've learned their lesson quite well to not hold on these ticking timebombs. So we've got institutional sums of  money, institutions who want to collect on high yield debt securities,  institutions who want to collect CDS payments, institutions on the other  side of the CDS contract wanting to collect on the default payout, and  on the other end, small businesses that wouldn't have a business case if  they didn't have access to enough upfront cash financed with debt  chasing a pipe dream.\n\nThat leaves a big question, and that question is how it keeps on ending up that these small, risk-laden businesses get funded? The answer to that question are *Business Development Companies*. These  companies are publicly traded, they can be publicly financed, and  they can also take out loans themselves from large banks because hey,  they're not as at risk of going tits up as those small time pissant risk-laden companies. So these BDCs take the capital they've raised and  bankroll all the risky shit that banks wouldn't want to touch. And they  diversify their investments to make sure that their endeavors in  financing risky companies don't go to shit. And they package up these loans into securitized financial instruments and we go right back into  the shit.\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/bdc-mmclo/bdcs-add-mid-market-clos-to-funding-mix-idUSL2N23O0RF](https://www.reuters.com/article/bdc-mmclo/bdcs-add-mid-market-clos-to-funding-mix-idUSL2N23O0RF)\n\nSo, how do we profit from knowing that everyone's getting ready for these corporate debt capital bubbles to pop? Short the fuck outta BDCs. In particular, ones more retarded and higher leveraged than ourselves, like Prospect Capital.\n\nProspect Capital | NASDAQ: PSEC Market Cap: 1.79b; **Net Debt: 2.003b**\n\nThey deal in a lot of debt capital, but what makes them a standout is that they deal primarily with sub-lien/junior level debt. This means that **they are paid last in the lending totem pole** while leveraging themselves to the fucking tits. On top of that, they also like playing on the risky side of loans, with 3 consumer loan companies and 1 \"not a loan company\" company. With unemployment rising, we can expect people to default on loans in a credit crunch. And these retards who own sub-lien debt will be paid last if there's a default.\n\n[https://ww2.prospectstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Diversified-Desktop-Chart-03-10-20.png](https://ww2.prospectstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Diversified-Desktop-Chart-03-10-20.png)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**PSEC 01/21/2021 4p; PSEC 5/15 5p**", "created_utc": 1584725235.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flyxzw/found_the_company_bagholding_the_debt_bubble/", "is_self": true}
