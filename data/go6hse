{"id": "go6hse", "title": "VTIQ post merger with NKLA", "selftext": "As of right now, VTIQ is scheduled to vote on the merger on June 2nd, and is largely expected to go ahead with it shortly thereafter, where shares of VTIQ (and VTIQW) will become shares of NKLA (and NKLAW) in a 1 to 1 ratio.\n\nI personally am of the belief that shares will rise as we get closer to June 2nd and to the merger, but my question is, what happens post merger? \n\nI\u2019ve heard that even though shares transfer 1 to 1, there are more NKLA shares being added as well and that overall shares will become diluted, lowering share prices. Is this accurate?\n\nAlso regarding warrants (VTIQW), I\u2019ve read that if the price of shares stays above $18 for a certain amount of time that they can make you exercise them?\n\nCould anyone clarify these 2 concerns and in general share your thoughts on whether or not it would be wise to hold shares/warrants post merger?", "created_utc": 1590099087.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/go6hse/vtiq_post_merger_with_nkla/", "is_self": true}
