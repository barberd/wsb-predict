{"id": "glrwvm", "title": "Dissecting Projected Med-LT Downwards Movement & Plays for the Week Ahead 5/18", "selftext": "Aloha fellow autists, for those already looking for positions, TL;DR will be at the end of the ~~post~~ wall of text; but before getting to positions I would like to lay forth my Med-LT projections for the course of the S&P 500/NASDAQ & approximations of what I believe to be as a 'healthy bottom' in the markets following the global deleveraging which is currently underway.\n\n\\*Note- I won't be diving very deep into the fundamentals in this post for the sake of trimming fat off of the data & analysis; but for those interested in my PoV of the fundamentals which I build my projections on, reference this post/give it a quick read - [Economic Stagflation, Financial Corruption, Dying Industries, and a Need to Revolutionize](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fvjlin/economic_stagnation_financial_corruption_dying/).\\*\n\n**Scope of Long-Term Projections (S&P/NASDAQ)**\n\nFirst, to present the scope of my S&P projection. First [the monthly chart](https://gyazo.com/f3e617e61dfa22c6761d0d679339fb52), then a [Daily Chart](https://gyazo.com/c268b3d7c1f7d80d436b7e5a6a1cdfdc) of a 1-0 fib-retracement back down to the highs of the 2000 dotcom bubble & 2007 GFC. The 1 level (peak price) was put in place under the notion that major investor confidence had peaked in US markets the week of Jan 17th's opening price of \\~3335 at the start of this 'corona-virus black-swan event'/as the first case had been reported in the US via mainstream media, and with the belief we will be finding a true bottom around the highs of the 2000 'dotcom bubble' (\\~1555 on the S&P.)\n\n\\*Note, these projections coincide with the parameters of 'Economic Stagnation' which I talk about in my 'fundamentals' post. To briefly outline a major point in the post, acknowledging that we find the genuine basis of a secular bull markets around the peak of our last run when forced into genuine innovation to produce economic productivity (While also respecting the reality that fiscal policies can/will send us into over-reactionary runs in either direction - IE: 2029 High following the roaring 20's, the following Great Depression's Low.... the 2020 High....)\\*\n\nI also mentioned the [NASDAQ](https://gyazo.com/27bfaa75f69057117f18ea0539301349) early on -Which  I've charted with the same exact 'scope,' being the time-line/High&Low points. Imo this index even more than the S&P truly showcases the over-reactive nature of the markets, investor greed/FOMO, and the impact of modern active fiscal policies on natural market movement/the 'precision' of Elliott wave theory. In my eyes, confirming the 5K low-projection as a significant price point in the past; which can be seen [on the daily chart](https://gyazo.com/4fe4b44e3da32cf0883cae330f63e557) as confirmed resistance/'the highs' in 2000, and also note the interaction with the 5k price point [on the monthly chart](https://gyazo.com/2ed7218fcc75e3cec9aa7f7b8296352d) from 2015-17 (seen as resistance for the most of 2015 with an 'island top' pattern which then collapsed below before breaking out and back-testing as support in late 2016.)\n\nTo briefly discuss the timeline of these retracements,  (starting on January 1st 2020 and ending on July 1st 2021) I believe this crash/harship will somehow give the groundwork for our gov't to feed some kind of \"America 2.0\" recovery program \\~July 2021. Seriously, what better time to push such a propaganda piece other than the month we celebrate our country's independence? As for the starting date of this retracement; January 1st was the first public release from the WHO discussing 'A cluster of cases have emerged of a mysterious pneumonia,\" and thus \\*leads way to my 'starting date' of Jan 2nd, the first trading day of the month & new year.\n\n**The Path of These Projections/Calculation of Targets**\n\nNext, to present the projected path(s) of this deleveraging I'm using E.W.T. to draw rough price targets on the S\\&P; this is analysis under the belief that Elliott Wave Theory still holds a level of accuracy despite modern active fiscal policy intervention in the markets/economically. I'm viewing this price action as a '[Down-trending impulse wave](https://gyazo.com/f77bc5e3d987095ca54addb9f2f1f213).' For Those that don't care about the explanation of the technical's and just want a cut and dry projection minus all the gibberish below - [Here](https://gyazo.com/05998bb307c8277d633419f9c973a704).\n\nThe first Fib is the same retracement from above, just labeled as 'LT Corrective Wave' since that's ultimately what I'm viewing this move as, (A LT Correction in the debt cycle.) The Second Fib is actually the length of Wave 1 from tip to tail to show's that our relief rally (Wave 2) has behaved to E.W.T. within reason thus far and would be confirmed as wave 2 considering we've rejected breaking above the .382 retracement level (or in other words have maxed out at bull momentum \\~0.618 the length of Wave 1). Next (and note that following last week I believe we have just entered) is Fib/Wave 3 - Wave 3 is the longest wave in the series and is ultimately to be at least 1.618 the length of Wave 1 (doesn't mean it has to be in a crash lol, it could be very very drawn out.) Wave 4 will then be another relief rally .5 the length of Wave 1. Followed by Wave 5 which I have drawn as .618 the length of Wave 1 (It very well could be shorter, that will be a discussion for a later time once we can better understand any news/media catalysts at play.) Then we have corrective waves A,B,C which ultimately in my eyes will lay forth the groundwork for the genuine beginnings of our next secular bull market. \\*Note, if you've made it this far and understand what I'm saying then you also understand that this outcome is one derivative of 72 potential outcomes given that we are still so early in the move.\n\n\\*I would also like to note that given the circumstances of the global economy in the Med-LT this creates an extremely bullish case for gold & silver, gold should've been a no brainer to pick up following it's pull-back caused by the liquidity crisis in early March. I believe if we see the economic contraction which I had set-forth then spot gold could easily be pushing $3k around the time our markets are finding bottom. Silver traditionally will also act similarly to gold given circumstances around fiat currencies, however silver tends to act on a slight delay relative to gold in this regard.\n\n**Short Term Movement / What to Watch This Week**\n\n[S&P](https://gyazo.com/344ea72b3f8edf40894c9b198e55c33c)/General Markets - Similarly to last week, I'm writing this as the futures open with a gap up and proceed for to push upwards of about 1% green. The DXY has created huge support and appears ready for a breakout, gold is trading higher than friday's close, in my opinion, all of which are signals similar to what we had seen in late February warning us to start to consider exiting the markets. I'm expecting early upwards movement in the markets to push up enough for one more test this downtrend line seen on the Fib-entrancement before once again rolling over to significant downside & finally breaking down below this H&S neckline for good (Targeting \\~270 EoW/mid-late week.) To give an even tighter projection on when I believe the markets will experience significant downside again,  I would like to show this 1 hour chart of the [H&S formation](https://gyazo.com/deee92a5b8070f9bb4cfa7fb2ed37f63). So. Much. Selling. Pressure... Seriously, this thing is riddled with red dildos.  At best I believe the MM's will be able to push the markets upwards of a 2895 back-test at most before rolling over going into the second half of the trading day on Monday (\\~ 2-4PM trading time-frame.)\n\n[$XLF](https://gyazo.com/5f1e7a69a2edbaa85b48906d3d0d76be) Called out the broken H&S pattern in my post last week & claimed it to be a leading indicator for the general markets direction, I believe the same will continue to prove true moving forward. That said, looking for an entry on June 19th $18p during AM-lunch trading session (whenever the S&P pushing near the 289-290 range, which could push to as close to \\~21.50 as on XLF I would say.)\n\n[$AMD](https://gyazo.com/461a4f07a758e37064a338d080929dc2) \\- I've been catching a fair amount of flack for calling out AMD as a short for the three weeks now, but had anyone taken the chance on taking positions near the resistance levels I was calling out then they would've been able to play these massive movements while consistently rolling profits into later dated contracts. Executives have been dumping their shares of stock left and right since leading up to and following their ER release, I wouldn't be surprised if the company knows their growth is going to be stunted for at least 4 quarters if not longer (Let's not forget the 190 PE ratio the damn stock is trading at based on current share price and Q1 EPS.....) AMD $40p June 19th & $20p Oct 16th\n\n[$GDX](https://gyazo.com/f398759a085855ffc19ceabbef128336) \\- I'm pissed I didn't have the funds to act on this play before the markets ran up end of week giving the gold miners a heaftyyy run. That said, I believe this will prevail as a parabolic play through the rest of the year as gold miners are just only now returning to their 'fair value' and look ready for an over-reactionary  pop like in the early 2010's. I'm also bullish asf on spot gold price given the current economic circumstances and considering we're actually in a very interesting position with gold. Bears kept claiming \"gold miners will be shut down due to CV blah blah,\" but that was bullish for spot gold price. Anyone that wants to buy physical gold right now is paying between $100-150/oz more than spot in the futures due to this fact. I honestly believe spot gold price could push to kiss 3k come summer 2021.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR - Magic Crayon Lines & witchcraft elude to markets bottom \\~July 2021...
