{"id": "f3urhv", "title": "$SPCE RACE", "selftext": "Ok, so I really don't know what the fuck I'm doing. I started investing when this subreddit started trending. I have no fucking money, so I bought two shares of SPCE at $21.56 on 2/12 and now they're at $27.36 as of this post. \n\nThere's a clear pattern here: The shares goes up a little each day, they crash a little when the market starts to close, then they go up a little more the next day. This is probably going to continue until the launch, where they will probably crash hard, then possibly soar depending on how that launch goes.\n\nPoint is, you autists better hold onto your SPCE because it's not going to crash particularly hard for at least another week. I'm no expert obviously, but I can analyze trends pretty well. I'm gonna call $35 for 2/21 and then buy the dip that day if things are looking like they'll go well launch-wise.\n\nThoughts?", "created_utc": 1581698410, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3urhv/spce_race/", "is_self": true}
