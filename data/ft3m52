The truly wealthy people and large institutions of the world are all about fixed income. Rich people especially love things like municipal bonds and such for their federal tax advantages. Keep this in mind below:\n\nAccording to my friend who works the fixed income trading desk at one of the largest brokerage firms, short term treasuries went negative for a brief time this morning. In fact, said firm had to close {{3}} of their money market funds to new investors today to protect existing customers from negative yields. In layman\u2019s terms, so much money was thrown at money market instruments from big players today that prices went up for treasuries so high that yields went negative. In response, they shut down their money market mutual funds to avoid having to buy more treasuries pushing yields even lower.\n\nWhere was this influx of money coming from, you ask? The rich are rotating out of municipal bonds into money market instruments. That\u2019s HUGE. Think about it: You know it\u2019s bad when the ultra wealthy are voluntarily asking to pay higher taxes and accept lower yields (which they would by moving their wealth from muni\u2019s into US treasuries).\n\n*My personal thoughts:*\n\nThe implication? \u201cSmart Money\u201d thinks city and state governments aren\u2019t going to be able to pay  on their bonds. Why wouldn\u2019t cities and states be able to meet their debt obligations? There\u2019s no tax revenue. Why is there no tax revenue? Because their residents aren\u2019t going to be working and there ain\u2019t no business/commerce that\u2019s gonna be conducted anytime soon.\n\nTldr; Puts [on whatever suits your fancy].\n\n[Edit: I am NOT suggesting puts on municipal bond funds. I AM suggesting smart money knows that the overall economic situation is more dire than the stock market would suggest, and is positioning itself accordingly. The fools of r/Investing say we\u2019re at the bottom and everyone should DCA their paychecks into the stock market. In contrast, \u201csmart money\u201d is saying commerce is going to be shut down for a while. If that\u2019s the case, how can you look at current valuations with a straight face? Current stock market is OVER priced. Ergo, short the market.]", "created_utc": 1585760387.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ft3m52/dd_from_the_world_of_fixed_income/", "is_self": true}
