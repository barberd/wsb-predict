{"id": "ck8rfe", "title": "$GSK is printing money (?)", "selftext": "I've been following $GSK for a while now and seeing that pharma isn't big over here, apart from shkreli, I'll assume little know what GSK is. In short, they're the sixth largest pharma with a mkt cap in excess of $200bn, they released earnings two days ago and and beat on EPS ($0.14) and on revenue ($322m) and the stock peaked at $42.18 that day.\n\nAnyways, enough with the boring shit. You might ask, how is it printing money? The stock barely fucking moves, it keeps playing between \\~$39.5 to $41.5 and I've got reason to belive it'll stay in that range for a while. Two brief points worth noting:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **The whole brexit fuckery**: the company is based in the UK and thus reports earnings in pounds which took a huge shit a couple days back and all translates to uncertainty for an investor, at least a US investor that is. And it is apparently a huge deal as dividends declared back on home soil remain higher (historically) than those declared in the US and why is that?  gbp/usd value over time.\n* **They're pretty solid and growing:** a while back they were discussing a joint venture with pfitzer, their biopharma department is a cash cow even with it's \\~3% market share and their pipeline is pretty crouded and currently has their HIV treatment awaiting registration with numerous others you can check [here](https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/research-and-development/our-pipeline/).\n\nGiven a different time, the stock wouldn't be as undervalued as it is right now but brexit is taking such a toll on them, and that's where you autists can make up some of your losses that you've YOLO'd on BYND. \n\nTheir average volume is close to \\~$2.2m shares a day, plenty liquid out there for you and IV is pretty fucking low, we're talking sub 16% here and options are pretty cheap too, just check for yourself.\n\nEither I'm missing something here or this seems like a great oppertunity to buy some butterflies/condors on.", "created_utc": 1564581032, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ck8rfe/gsk_is_printing_money/", "is_self": true}
