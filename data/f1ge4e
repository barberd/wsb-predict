{"id": "f1ge4e", "title": "TSM January earnings", "selftext": "So unlike most other companies that post their earnings only every quarter, $TSM posts for every month. They'll be posting their January numbers on Feb 10th(from what I've heard). \n\nDuring their last earnings call, they said their guidance for this quarter was around a 50% increase in sales. What got them down Jan 16, was their earnings to revunue ratio which was not as good as last year, and because of that it suffered the same fate as Facebook for their earnings.\n\nNow this up to 50% increase in earnings is honestly beyond expectations. $TSM has factory production in China but said that they wouldn't be effected by the virus. So, although I have a high amount of calls in $TSM, I would like to say that this is not only something to buy calls for. But serves as a indicator. If Apple, Hauwei, and others cancelled orders from $TSM then it shows truly how bad the virus is and that we should be buying puts for Apple's likely dissapointing sales for this upcoming quarter. This should be reflected on $TSM's numbers. And if they truly hit a 50% increase in comparison to last year, hella buy calls for Apple, AMD, NVDA, and AMAT. But if it doesn't even come close be prepared for a rough first quarter.", "created_utc": 1581287571, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f1ge4e/tsm_january_earnings/", "is_self": true}
