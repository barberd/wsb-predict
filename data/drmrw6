{"id": "drmrw6", "title": "Pathological Bearishness", "selftext": "Im almost always bearish about stocks and most investments.  I constantly think they're high and need to go down. Most of the time im either selling my investments or buying puts. (I don't actually short anything though).\n\n If something just bounced 50% off lows I think it's a dead cat bounce and time to go back down at any minute. Being in feels very dangerous.  If something is in the middle of a 4 week rally then it has been rallying too long.  If something is at ath then its time to double top. If something is setting new highs then its WAYYY too high and HAS to come back down.\n\n The whole market looks like a huge bubble to me. I owned some low cap (banned here) investments in 2013 that have since gained 50,000% but i was constantly selling them because they were SOO high. \n\nOccasionally I go long or buy a call if I think I've called an exact bottom. Then I scalp the beginning of the bounce and sell it so that i can scream at it as it continues up another 100%+ and bash it on public forums.  \n\nI think alot of us here have trouble with this kind of thing?  Is this pathological? Is it part of the autism spectrum?  How do we get help with this?", "created_utc": 1572896081, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/drmrw6/pathological_bearishness/", "is_self": true}
