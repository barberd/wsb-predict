{"id": "fkz2cw", "title": "[DD] All Lakers and Nets tested for the virus. Recovery begins 3/31.", "selftext": "We have quite a dangerous situation on our hands, right?  This is no joke.  \n\nAccordingly, we are taking this matter very seriously.  It's like super serious!   Like people will die and society will unravel.  Years from now you will tell future generations about the _disgusting_ things you had to do to get your 300th extra roll of toilet paper. \n\n So what are we doing:\n\n- Closing schools (remember how many times they didn't close your school when you were a kid and now they close it for at least a month!  Kids these days have it so easy!).  Yep.\n\n- Restricting travel to other countries.  Yep.\n\n- Closing restaurants and bars (drinking away the pain at home just doesn't express my misery enough, I need to be in some piece of shit bar drinking grain alcohol).  Yep.\n\n- America alone spending at least a trillion to address it.  Yeppers.\n\n- Giving everyone equal access to test since it's a \"humanitarian crisis\".  Wait... \n\nThe testing facility won't even test me unless I see a doctor and prove that I don't have the flu or strep throat first.  That means I have to go to see a doctor before I can go to the testing facility you're asking me to go to during work hours since I can't go to work because the virus is so serious, I can't even work).  And yet ALL of the Lakers and Nets have been tested and they didn't even have to get out of their car once to do it.\n\nIt's almost as if, [cash rules everything around me.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBwAxmrE194). \n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nBecause it does.  And there's a lot less money being spent in a world where I sit on the my couch holding onto my cash to make sure I make my mortgage payment.  They'd much rather I give some money to my weed guy, spend a ton more money buying snacks and then my weed guy buys Jordan's with the money I paid him.  Win-Win-Win.\n\nGiving the Lakers and Nets special access to testing shows the common denominator in life is STILL money.    Come the end of the month people will prioritize money again, everyone will go back to work, and the economy will make money again.  \n\nWhy 3/31?  Because changing the calendar changes your mentality when it comes to big events.  You'll suddenly feel different in April.  The virus will be so-February by then.  Plus, April means Spring in people's minds.  And like the old saying goes \"Hope Springs Eternal Hope in the Spring\"\n\nPosition:  **CALLS MUTHFUCKA!** 6/19 The strike is SPY's opening amount on 3/31+25%.
