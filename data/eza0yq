{"id": "eza0yq", "title": "For those new to options trading", "selftext": "I see a lot of new, uninformed people in this sub, likely due to WSB making the front page again. Here\u2019s an FAQ for what I\u2019ve seen over the past few days.\n\n1. Can I dump my net worth into $0.01 OTM contracts to quickly double or triple my money?\nA: You sure can, and theta gang will thank you for it. See: theta, liquidity, delta. You will lose.\n\n2. Is (insert generic meme RH ticker) a good option to buy? (Note they don\u2019t mention call/put or strike)\nA: Quit polluting our sub and do your own research. There are so many books and videos you may never finish all the resources.\n\n3. I have $3k to blow, what should I spend it on?\nA: See 2, also odd flex but ok.\n\n4. Options trading is so easy, how do you guys even lose money lol?\nA: First one (or two, maybe three) is free. I\u2019ll be on the winning end of your trade before you know it, rookie.\n\n5. What is a call (or a put)?\nA: A way to donate money to theta gang. Seriously I\u2019m all for answering questions but I can\u2019t handle this dumb shit that google can answer in 10 seconds.", "created_utc": 1580911523, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eza0yq/for_those_new_to_options_trading/", "is_self": true}
