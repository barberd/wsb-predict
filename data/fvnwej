{"id": "fvnwej", "title": "Live and Let Live, My Retarded Autists!", "selftext": "Hoping for turmoil and expecting turmoil are two different things! I think it's safe to say that most of our resident Bears do not wish death and destruction. We only expect it! Patronizing them for simply trying to make some tendies is against the wsb vibe.  We, autists and retards all, are just trying to taste that sweet, sweet nectar that is tendies! Let us all play these swings. Let us all praise the autists who,  against all odds, bring home the tendies. Let us feel sorrow for the retards who tried. Because they tried real hard, boys. Let effort not go unnoticed! It is in this distracted effort that our wives' boyfriends slip in to our wives' panties and, later,  our own lives as we look on unabashed! ...mostly. \nYES! The market is propped on lies, and YES your wife is being boned by the autist who knew.  BUT!! We can all have dreams. Dreams of a tendy laden future where we retards have transcended! Where WE are the autists boning the retards' wives! \n\nI dream of a new WSB. A WSB where we autists, artists even,  and retards all around are boning eachothers' wives! On a pile of tendies! TOGETHER! So live and let live. Bears are bears,  and bulls are bulls. But, someday we may all be autists! And retards! At the same time! In the greatest orgy man has ever seen. \n\n                                             -Myself, I  $SPY230p:4/17\n\n\n\n\nPS: The orgy will be on hold until social distancing has been lifted. Sorry, guys. This at least gives us time to weed out the nonbelievers.", "created_utc": 1586129782.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fvnwej/live_and_let_live_my_retarded_autists/", "is_self": true}
