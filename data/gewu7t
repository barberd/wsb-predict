Just hired a loyalist (top donor) to position of Postmaster General (hilarious title). \n\nSo let's say USPS dies off this summer, goes bankrupt or something... FDX/UPS/AMZN stand to benefit?\n\nI feel like neither company has the capacity to step in and fill the role of the USPS and the USA would just be fucked for a while in terms of mail. It's not a very profitable business. USPS was losing money cause they're mandated to deliver mail everywhere, even the far reaches of Alaska. \n\nI need a shipping and mail industry insider to provide cutting edge information on this potential play.", "created_utc": 1588813724.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gewu7t/what_happens_when_trump_kills_the_us_postal/", "is_self": true}
