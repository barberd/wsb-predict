{"id": "f6kk0d", "title": "lets get that $CAKE", "selftext": "I saw a post from earlier of someone pushing $CAKE. It sparked my interest because of them acquiring Fox Restaurant Concepts last year. FRC was started in Tucson, AZ and quickly became a massively successful restaurant company in Arizona. Every restaurant they start in various areas of cuisine does extremely well. If you've ever dined at a FRC restaurant you know just how good the service, food, and atmosphere are.  Before the acquisition they had expanded into 10 states with 21 locations. Cheesecake Factory dished out a massive $448 million to acquire them. \n\n[https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/emerging-brands/fox-deal-done-cheesecake-factory-embarks-new-growth-plan](https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/emerging-brands/fox-deal-done-cheesecake-factory-embarks-new-growth-plan)\n\nAccording to this article, the $441 million gives them the brand and access to Sam Fox, the creator of FRC. This man has the restaurant business down to a fine science.  Here is a good article on him if you'd like to learn more.\n\n[https://www.azcentral.com/story/entertainment/dining/2019/08/03/sam-fox-restaurants-cheesecake-factory-phoenix-what-to-know/1901560001/](https://www.azcentral.com/story/entertainment/dining/2019/08/03/sam-fox-restaurants-cheesecake-factory-phoenix-what-to-know/1901560001/)\n\nIf Cheesecake is successful in expanding on Sam Fox's vision they could see some great growth in the coming years.", "created_utc": 1582159286, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6kk0d/lets_get_that_cake/", "is_self": true}
