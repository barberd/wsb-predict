All you need to know is that there are 115 candidates, and only 5 of those have actually made it into clinic so far. However, ALL of these vaccines are all from technology that has NEVER been used before in vaccines. Moderna ($MRNA) and Inovio ($INO) are both genetic material based. You may be asking, what the heck does that mean for making $$$$$? Well, this means that what we're attempting has NEVER been done before, and the margin for error is really high. Aka, the timeline that we'll have a vaccine by early next year is all banging on the fact that these risky vaccines will work.\n\nNot only that, but bc these are new types of vaccines, no one has the manufacturing capabilities to actually churn out a ton of these for all you autists. Bill Gates is already working on building factories to make the vaccines, but even that won't be enough to cover all our population (prob will be given to health and essential workers first). Currently, INO's manufacturing capabilities would let them make 1 million vaccines a year. That's like, nothing. MRNA has also gotten a $400M grant from the government. This sounds like a lot of money, but clinical trials are really expensive to run. This should cover their clinical trial costs, but not much after that.\n\nTo give you something to compare to, the average timeline to make a vaccine is 10 years (Ebola was fastest in 5 years), and typically the failure rate is 90%. So everyone hoping that we'll have a cure for this by next year is really optimistic.\n\nMRNA started trials on healthy normal young 20 year olds should end in June, and they'll report positive data saying no one died from their vaccine. Duh. The stock will still go up. Buy calls before June 1st, sell. The next round of clinical trials actually test if it works against COVID, and there's a hot chance it won't. Buy puts after June 1st. The price action on MRNA is banking on the fact that their vaccine works, but there's a much higher chance it won't. *Also, the FDA has notoriously high standards for vaccines (different from drugs) bc a vaccine is given to healthy people, so any type of side effects are a no-go.* \n\nTo hedge this put in case MRNA's vaccine is efficacious, buy puts on INO at the same time.\n\nINO's trials on rly healthy people doesn't end till in Nov, so I feel like they might tank when MRNA announces that their trial went well. Buy puts on INO, or just short the stock directly it's cheap so even you autists can afford it.\n\nOnce we start seeing headlines saying that MRNA or INO's vaccine failed in phase 2 clinical trials those stocks will tank, and so will everyone's hopes and dreams. Also, this is a motherfucking rat race, in that even if one of their vaccines is actually good, they have to be the first one to be approved to get credit for it. If someone has a vaccine and gets data and FDA approval a week before you, bye bye you done. Flush your stock down the toilet. If you buy long-term puts on a bunch of the companies trying to make a vaccine, if one of them actually works (better chance of seeing God but still), then you can still bank on all the other stocks TANKING on positive data from the other vaccine and you should still end up net positive. MRNA stock is up over 100% bc of corona, and INO used to trade at 4 before this.\n\ntldr; can't bank on a vaccine to save us, market has priced in a vaccine being available by next year which is the best case scenario. Buy puts on MRNA and INO. Best case scenario, both will go donw, and worst case, one will tank while the other will skyrocket.  **MRNA 20p 1/21**, **INO 4p 1/21**", "created_utc": 1587415159.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g50rmd/play_on_mrna_and_ino/", "is_self": true}
