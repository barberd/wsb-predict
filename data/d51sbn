{"id": "d51sbn", "title": "SLV might make a comeback", "selftext": "As we all know, SLV and GLD took a hit last week. The fed meeting is coming in the next few days and I've a feeling they're going to do a surprise rate cut much larger than the markets expect. Hear me out\n\nChina cut reserve requirements at the beginning of the month, freeing up liquidity. \n\nECB cut rates and is planning to pump 20B Euros into the financial markets, in addition to cutting it's deposit rate to an all time low of -.5%.\n\nThe way I see it, this is going to put strong pressure on the dollar to rise, which the current administration DOES NOT want. A rising dollar makes servicing our debt much more expensive, and with the U.S. being in record amounts of debt this is obviously a problem. Not to mention the major market indicies are barely off all time highs, unlike everywhere else in the world that peaked years ago. \n\nI know for a fact that Jpow has said recently in his speech is Sweden that they're willing to see a period of higher inflation to \"catch up\" for the inflation that we haven't had. IMO it's a subtle hint of what the federal reserve wants to do to the dollar; FUCKING WEAKEN IT!\n\nI'm really thinking about buying calls on SLV about 3 weeks out. If the fed cuts 50+ basis points, this could potentially light a fire under the price of PM's, and if the rate cut turns out to be bigger than the market anticipates, SLV could move 1$ or more in a day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat are your thoughts?", "created_utc": 1568645746, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d51sbn/slv_might_make_a_comeback/", "is_self": true}
