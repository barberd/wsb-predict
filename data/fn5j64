We understand that you would like us to provide you with at least $54 billion so that you can avoid bankruptcy. Please understand that times are tough for us, too. Lots of us are getting hammered. Two years ago, our government enacted a corporate tax cut that saved you and other US companies hundreds of billions of dollars. This tax cut benefited you and your shareholders, but it also ballooned our annual government deficit to more than $1 trillion a year. \n\nWith the coronavirus now plunging our economy into recession, our tax revenue will tank, and our deficit will skyrocket even more, perhaps to $2 trillion or $3 trillion per year. So we're not as flush as we should have been. \n\nAs you know well your business is cyclical. So cyclical in fact that many of you have already gone bankrupt in the past. So you could have saved this cash for a rainy day. But you didn't.\n\nAlthough the coronavirus pandemic is bad luck, it was not unforeseeable. In fact, at least one of your members, American Airlines, explicitly foresaw it. In recent financial filings, American cited \"outbreaks of diseases that affect travel behavior\" as a major risk to its business. \n\nSo, while we sympathize with your plight, please understand that we're not going to just \"grant\" you the money. You and your shareholders and lenders knew the risks you were taking, and, for more than a decade, you enjoyed the rewards. \n\nAlso, you aren't the only ones who need our help. Just ask the cruise lines, hotel companies, and restaurants, bars, gyms, and other establishments in so many of our American communities that have been forced to close altogether \u2014as well as the millions of Americans who will soon be laid off. \n\nSo, your $54+ billion bailout will be structured as follows: \n\n 1. A senior, secured credit line that will allow you to borrow the money you need to operate and pay your taxes while you figure out how to survive. \n\n2. This credit line will pay interest at a rate that compensates taxpayers for the use of our money and the risks we are taking. \n\n3. The use of this credit line will also require you to issue equity to taxpayers to allow us to share in your recoveries, if any. Yes, this equity issuance will dilute your shareholders and cause your stock prices to drop. But not as much as they will if you go bust. \n\n4. Our credit line, moreover, will be senior to all of your other debt and secured by your airplanes and other assets. If, despite our help, you fail, we will sell your airplanes and recoup 100 cents on our dollars before any of your other lenders get a penny. To be clear, we are not in the investment business. We are the \"lender of last resort.\" We do not think all or even most of you will survive this crisis, and we do not expect to make money on this transaction. We are angry that you did not conserve your cash for this rainy day, and if we did not have an economy to save and millions of Americans to help, we would just let you fail. \n\nIf you think you can get better terms from another investor, we encourage you to get them. We are offering you this lifeline because we benefit from having an airline industry and the jobs and services it provides. In this time of national crisis, we also do not think it is in our interests to let all of you go bankrupt at once. Thank you again for your request. We look forward to working with you.\n\nSincerely, \n\nThe American people", "created_utc": 1584905412.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fn5j64/how_the_government_should_respond_to_desperate/", "is_self": true}
