If you can\u2019t time the market, you will lose much more then you win.\n\n2. Stick with meme stocks. Don\u2019t be afraid to buy AMD calls. \n\n3. Many times the best thing to do is buy SPY FD calls. \n\n4. Don't be afraid of being highly concentrated in certain stocks/sectors. You may want to buy 1MM worth of F calls on margin, and that\u2019s okay, but do your research and monitor more closely if you are highly autistic. \n\n5. Don\u2019t forget to inverse yourself. If you buy AAPL calls instead of puts like you want to, you\u2019ll have way more money which will allow you the freedom of taking more risks. \n\n6. Be aware of theta. You\u2019re a mod if you only sell but for real, watch out.
