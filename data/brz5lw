{"id": "brz5lw", "title": "LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY: Avon (AVP) Monster Pop on Thursday 5/23", "selftext": "Thesis:  Avon (AVP) is being bought by Natura Cosmeticos SA.  Natura trades on the Brazilian Stock Exchange (B3) for 61.5 BRL (15.22USD).  Natura will give AVP shareholders 0.3 shares of Natura stock for every 1 share of Avon stock.  Natura is creating a new holding company and will allow the shareholders to have their shares traded on the B3 exchange or NYSE via a new ADR.  Natura is going to buy Avon based on a market cap of $3.7 billion.  It's current market cap is $1.4B.  This suggests the stock tomorrow should rally to between $8.4 and $15 based on share price premium and stock conversion. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you have are in a RISK ON appetite you should buy this pre-market to get in early.\n\nIf you have a RISK OFF style and want to be more careful, wait 5-10 minutes after market closes to confirm the uptrend.\n\nThis is one of the few times in a year where you could easily 2x to 3x your account in under 90 minutes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGoodluck and I hope it works out.   I bought before the close at $3.61.  Might dip back in for more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Good news article:**\n\n[https://www.prnewswire.com/il/news-releases/natura-co-and-avon-join-forces-to-create-a-direct-to-consumer-global-beauty-leader-300855545.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/il/news-releases/natura-co-and-avon-join-forces-to-create-a-direct-to-consumer-global-beauty-leader-300855545.html)\n\n**If you can read Portuguese:**\n\n [https://natu.infoinvest.com.br/ptb/7085/19550\\_691987.pdf](https://natu.infoinvest.com.br/ptb/7085/19550_691987.pdf)", "created_utc": 1558587919, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/brz5lw/lifetime_opportunity_avon_avp_monster_pop_on/", "is_self": true}
