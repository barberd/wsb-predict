With everyone migrating to digital platform because of Covid, just like everyone\u2019s wives\u2019 boyfriends here, GoDaddy would enjoy the tailwind similar to Wix (definitely not Shopify craze, unless you\u2019re too autistic). \n\nNow even before Covid, GoDaddy had been growing pretty steadily almost tripling its revenue in less than a decade. \n\nhttps://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GDDY/godaddy/revenue\n\nIts subscription business model means existing clients are pretty sticky and provides a stable base. \n\nValuation wise, it\u2019s super CHEAP compared to Wix. It\u2019s basically >3x Wix revenue but valued LESS than Wix, though growth is slower (GoDaddy 10%, Wix 20%). GoDaddy P/S ratio is 4, Wix is 12, his Royal Highness Shopify is 65. \n\nTo make things even juicier is the options IV, it\u2019s still only around 40%, indicating GoDaddy had been completely forgotten by the Covid crowd. \n\nThere\u2019s always risk GoDaddy would continue to be forgotten just like the tanker gang. Liquidity even for the stock is very limited compared to other memes.
