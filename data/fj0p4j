{"id": "fj0p4j", "title": "Dumb stats from a retard.", "selftext": "There's simple math at work. Right now the average infected per 1 million is 20 globally. The worst country, Italy has 350 per million. This means if we take the average of 20 per million in America, that's 6 million people infected. If we are going down Italy's path, that would mean 112 million people would be infected with a 3% death rate. That would equal 1 million Americans dead from this virus. This is not a joke and real numbers. Please take this virus seriously.  It's not the flu. \n\nBUY PUTS AND STAY INSIDE", "created_utc": 1584275745.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fj0p4j/dumb_stats_from_a_retard/", "is_self": true}
