Enjoy. \n\nPsycho High School GF - PYPL 130c 5/15 \nIts your Junior Year in HS. You think you have life by the balls, your girlfriend is hot, she loves giving head, and you just got accepted to your favorite state school cause you wanna drink and slay some ass (you dont know youre gay yet, we\u2019ll get into that some day). You know at some point this relationship will end but you want to enjoy this ride as long as you can. Its coming up on last period of the day, she come up to you and tells you that she wants to talk. Shes pregnant. You dont know what to do. You act like you\u2019ll be supportive but in the back of your head, you want out. Youre going to run away to Tijuana and get into cock fighting to fulfill your crippling gambling addiction. She thinks youre going to love and support her. You make her think this until you have an exit strategy. You go to her house later that day still in shock because she wants to talk about the options. She takes you to her room. Her hot best friend youve had those wet dreams about is naked on the bed. Your girlfriend is not pregnant and was testing you to see if you\u2019d be there for her. You passed. Youve fucking done it. That porn you\u2019ve been watching just came true. After all of this. You gain post-nut clarity that even though she wants a future with you, you realize that she is out of her fucking mind. You break up with her the next day while youre still ahead. Look at you, accomplished the threesome but with a subsided minor stroke at the age of 17. Congratulations. \n\nNo gay jokes today. Love you PayPal and Peloton. Fuck you Zynga. Have a nice day. \n\nPositions: Z 42p 5/15 & SBUX 80c 6/19", "created_utc": 1588870476.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gfab2b/options_as_people_part_4/", "is_self": true}
