{"id": "fne6fx", "title": "Surviving coronavirus with JD. Doing the research so you don't have to", "selftext": "Alright, gather up for some casual DD from someone who has been following JD.com very closely for years. \n\nJD.com is a quiet behemoth of the Chinese e-commerce. At #2 in China, it owns and operates the most sophisticated delivery network in China (JD Logistics), which alone is worth around $8-10 billion. With revenues hitting almost $83 billion last year, they have powerful backing from Walmart and Tencent, which together own \\~25% of Jd.com. Even [Google invested $550 million in JD.com \\~1.5 years ago](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hendriklaubscher/2018/06/18/google-invests-550m-in-jd-com-what-are-the-long-term-implications/#3692b6943b66), and they are likely to expand the partnership to assist Google in expanding in SEA, while Google helps JD.com expand in the US.\n\nDuring coronavirus, JD.com was the only company delivering to parts of the Hubei province most affected. They linked up agricultural sellers and grocers to hospitals and retail consumers, and were critical to keeping the food and basic essentials coming. As a result, they [earned a lot of goodwill during the Covid outbreak](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4324626-alibaba-bares-heart-jd-logistics-enjoys-enormous-goodwill) both in Hubei province and elsewhere in China, as Chinese government frequently tried to show what a great job they were doing to their local population, by highlighting what JD was doing (# of deliveries, 20,000+ people they hired, the safety equipment they donated, drones they used, etc.). JD.com was able to continue deliveries throughout the crises, in the worst areas, same/next day, unlike the struggles Amazon, which is struggling right now in the US (and this isn\u2019t even the worst of it).\n\nChina has mostly recovered from COVID-19, so Chinese ADRs are likely the only stocks you can expect to increase revenue/earnings in the near future, at least for the next few months (barring a miracle drug discovery next week).\n\nJD has been undervalued due to a number of issues (fake CEO scandal, China trade war), while they continued to deliver \\~35% annualized revenue growth.\n\n\\*\\*Quick stats:\\*\\* Last year, JD had net income of $1.5 billion on revenues of $82.9 billion. To put that in perspective, Alibaba had net income of $13B on revenues of $56B, and Amazon had $11.5B net income on revenues of $280B. JD.com is still ramping up, but would you guess that their market cap is only $55 billion, compared to $486 billion for Alibaba, and $919 billion for Amazon (which recently even crossed $1 trillion)?\n\nThey are likely to continue on their upwards trajectory, and given how they have become comfortably profitable over the last few years, expect the stock price to catch up to net income/revenue reality in the next year or two. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Things going for JD:**\n\n\\- Generated $2.8 billion in FCF in 2019, and announced [$2 billion buyback program](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-jd-com-buyback/chinas-jdcom-to-buy-back-2-billion-shares-idUSKBN2141UF) recently \n\n\\- Looking to do a [secondary listing on the Hong Kong exchange](https://www.scmp.com/tech/e-commerce/article/3075343/jdcom-said-have-approached-ubs-bank-america-arrange-hong-kong), following Alibaba's. They'll likely raise a few $billion\n\n\\- Forecasted expecting \"at least 10% YoY growth\" in Q1 2020. How many companies in the world are saying \"at least double digit growth in Q1\" during the coronavirus crisis? Granted, this was 3 weeks ago, but this was announced after the Chinese coronavirus peak. They have a history of meeting or exceeding guidance (beat EPS and revenue estimates past 5 quarters in a row)\n\n\\- They are considering an [IPO for their logistics subsidiary, at a \\~$10 billion valuation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-23/jd-logistics-eyes-ipo-to-raise-up-to-10-billion-reuters-says)\n\n\\- They have consistently focused on integrity and combating fake/counterfeit products, and have [stayed off of US Treasury Dept\u2019s \u201cnotorious marketplaces\u201d list, unlike Alibaba](https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/2018_Notorious_Markets_List.pdf)\n\n\\- Gained 2-3 spots in Alexa global web rankings (from #14/13 to #11) in the past 90 days\n\n\\- They didn't include active monthly users from majority of the COVID-19 period in their Q4'19 update, so they'll show a dramatic YoY growth in users in Q1'20 earnings\n\n\\- Not only do they have minimal exposure to the world's consumers outside of China, but China is now recovering from coronavirus (or so they've wanted us to believe), so further coronavirus-related impact to financials will be limited (especially compared to the rest of the world)\n\n\\- They hold investments that alone almost add up to their market cap (e.g, VIPS, Farfetch, Gojek, JD Finance - spun off but JD receives 40 percent of pre-tax profit and has the option to convert that back to a 40 percent equity stake, JD Logistics - potential IPO soon)\n\n\\- They were able to [pilot their autonomous delivery vehicles and drone well ahead of schedule during the crisis](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Coronavirus/JD.com-makes-drone-deliveries-as-coronavirus-cuts-off-usual-modes). Should give them a leg up in that space because of proven capabilities despite probably not having the best technology in that space.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nOf course, the [fear meter is off the charts](https://money.cnn.com/data/fear-and-greed/), so the stock market may keep dropping and drag JD along in the short/medium-term. However, looking at daily performance, you'll notice that JD has been comfortably outperforming S&P 500 over the past month.\n\nThis is a longer-term, high growth play (200-300% in 1-2 years, with right positions), with a potential for a shorter term high profits. Can save you cash from the current market panic, while setting you up for some sweet gains down the road.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:**\n\n\\- April 17 2020 $45 Calls (Very Risky)\n\n\\- June 19 2020 $45 Calls (Risky) \n\n\\- September 18 2020 $50 Calls (Moderately Risky)\n\n\\- Jan 15 2021 $50 Calls (Fairly Safe)\n\n\\- Jan 21 2022 $55 Calls (Safe)\n\n\\- Stock on max margin (Safe, but not sure what you\u2019re doing on WSB)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Bonus:** current positions and YTD gain on JD.com. So close to $69,420...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/622xwihyqco41.png?width=311&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e350d70f6a161364efa66f2b1da99a69aad10ee", "created_utc": 1584938986.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fne6fx/surviving_coronavirus_with_jd_doing_the_research/", "is_self": true}
