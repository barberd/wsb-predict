{"id": "f94tyh", "title": "Corona and Math", "selftext": "So some fegs with PHD\u2019s estimate that corona will infect 40-70% of people within a year.\n\nLets say for sake of argument %50 of world population. So that is around 3.8 billion people. The mortality rate now is 2% but guess what, that is with low amount of cases with shit tonne resources attributed per infected. They are literally jacking off every patients to health.\n\nOnce shit hits the fan we wont have even enough basic fever relievers going around in 1st world let alone in 3rd. Forget personal massaging handjobs the corona virus patients are getting now.\n\nSo mortality rate is gonna go up boys, 20% of cases require extra hard handjobs including a rim job to nurse to health. Wont be enough people around to pass out all those rim jobs. So death rate of just below %20 is not unheard of. \n\nNow remember, current mortality is 2%. Prediction is 40-70% infected. At 50% infected and 1% mortality that is 38 million dead Karl. 38 fucking million at 1% mortality rate. At 2% its 76 million. Realistically if this does spread like these pHd dotards believe, mortality will go up to at least 10% cause we wont be able to nurse back those %20 acute cases. That is 380 million people dead.\n\nWW2 killed 75 million.\n\nEveryone remembers the post ww2 bull gang? We\u2019re going to super fucking charge it x5 boiss.
