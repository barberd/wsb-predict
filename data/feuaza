But then there\u2019s the biggest turd to come out of a constipated asshole in a long time, Ford which had the second highest debt and owns its own credit wing for selling cars. The turds already been beat up like a used pocket pussy in a high school but what other stocks are exposed to high debt and will get rekt?", "created_utc": 1583582823, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/feuaza/short_stocks_with_high_debt_fuck_bitches_with_dds/", "is_self": true}
