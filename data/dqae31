{"id": "dqae31", "title": "Stephen Hahn is the White Knight $BMY / $CELG Shorts have long awaited.", "selftext": "Short interest in $BMY has been long building and, perhaps, for rational reasons.\n\nA top cancer physician is now appointed to lead the FDA. When you get to the level Mr. Hahn is as a health exec, you become exposed to a cryptic degree of \"lobbying\".\n\nIngenious published in every press release regarding the announcement, there is mention of banning JUUL pods. Altria isn't moving on this. Already priced in? Probably. Healthcare stocks? What you aren't seeing is not.\n\nThink about this: the former acting commissioner was highly recommended for the position by so many groups. \n\nSo why, on a day Biotech booms, do investors start taking profit in a stock that has raised earnings guidance? Is it because they had lower SALES forecasts than street expectations? Who Trump would pick was undoubtedly a risk in their projection. And guess what, Trump did not pick their guy.\n\nThe value in the $BMY / $CELG merger is pure FDA Approval speculation, and a short squeeze has been occuring for quite sometime now.\n\n$BMY's financial condition is total ass. Plus, Merck &amp; Amgen have deeper ties to public policymakers that have the executive's ear.\n\nI have been inclined to believe the long dated calls that were recently rolled into were a hedge on a short position.\n\nHealthcare in general is going to take a beating next year until the election is over.\n\nThis is not about politics. This is about policy certainty. That is what the market cares about.\n\nSure, the merger won't get blocked, but don't be surprised if you get downgrade and price cut as early as next week. The financial industry speaks in coded language. I'm decoding it for you.\n\nI plan to piss money on weeklies for the next few months, as I will be pissing gold by January 2021.\n\nBy the way, $CELG just got downgraded at Baird due to uncertainty on some bullshit to excuse the fact they have insider information. The FDA commission was the real uncertainty.\n\nSee you in Tendie Town, USA.\n\nDD: friends in DC, borderline schizophrenia, and my mom telling me to never stop following my dreams", "created_utc": 1572642313, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dqae31/stephen_hahn_is_the_white_knight_bmy_celg_shorts/", "is_self": true}
