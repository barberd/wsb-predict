As our quarterly safety reports have shown, drivers using Autopilot register fewer accidents per mile than those driving without it. That\u2019s because Autopilot is designed to reduce fatigue by helping drivers stay in their lane, while also ensuring that they keep their hands on the wheel. While lane-keeping and hands-on monitoring can be extremely effective at helping to reduce the likelihood of an accident when Autopilot is in use, we believe that these precautions can also be extremely effective for preventing accidents when Autopilot is not in use. Today, we\u2019re introducing two new safety features designed to help prevent drivers from inadvertently departing their lane, which our data shows is a common cause of accidents when Autopilot is not in use. These new features \u2013 Lane Departure Avoidance and Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance \u2013 help drivers stay engaged and in their lane in order to avoid collisions.\n\n[Elon Musk Makes $500 Billion Autonomy Pitch to Investors | May 2 2019](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-02/musk-is-said-to-make-500-billion-autonomy-pitch-to-investors)\n\nThe chief executive officer said autonomy is a fundamental driver for Tesla and key to how it could become a \u201chalf-trillion dollar market cap company,\u201d said the people, who asked not to be identified because the call wasn\u2019t open to the public. A Tesla spokesman didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. The comments build on the case that Musk made during an investor day focused on autonomy last week that Tesla is on the cusp of having 1 million vehicles on the road that will be fully capable of driving themselves. The billionaire plans to put those cars into a shared robotaxi service that the CEO described as being lucrative for both the company and its customers.\n\n[Tesla delays electric semi truck production to next year | Apr 25th 2019](https://electrek.co/2019/04/25/tesla-semi-delay-electric-truck-production-next-year/)\n\nDuring its first quarter 2019 earnings call last night, Tesla confirmed that it is delaying the production of Tesla Semi, its electric semi truck program, to next year.

How puny. Do you construct children\u2019s toys?It's not a secret that Tesla is working on an electric pickup truck. In fact, it's scheduled to be revealed sometime later this year. As for its towing/hauling abilities, both are still up in the air. However, we do know that the expectations are high...very high. The truck will be a dual-motor, all-wheel-drive pickup with \"crazy torque &amp; a suspension that dynamically adjusts for load. Those will be standard,\" noted Musk in a previous tweet. We suspect that whatever a Ram 1500 or Ford F-150 can do, Tesla will one-up those figures.\n\n[Musk Says Tesla \\`Would Love to Be' in India This Year or Next | March 15 2019](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-15/musk-says-tesla-would-love-to-be-in-india-this-year-or-next)\n\nElon Musk isn\u2019t giving up on bringing Tesla Inc. to India. \u201cWould love to be there this year.

Sentry Mode adds a unique layer of protection to Tesla vehicles by continuously monitoring the environment around a car when it\u2019s left unattended. When enabled, Sentry Mode enters a \u201cStandby\u201d state, like many home alarm systems, which uses the car\u2019s external cameras to detect potential threats. If a minimal threat is detected, such as someone leaning on a car, Sentry Mode switches to an \u201cAlert\u201d state and displays a message on the touchscreen warning that its cameras are recording. If a more severe threat is detected, such as someone breaking a window, Sentry Mode switches to an \u201cAlarm\u201d state, which activates the car alarm, increases the brightness of the center display, and plays music at maximum volume from the car\u2019s audio system. If a car switches to \u201cAlarm\u201d state, owners will also receive an alert from their Tesla mobile app notifying them that an incident has occurred. They\u2019ll be able to download a video recording of an incident (which begins 10 minutes prior to the time a threat was detected) by inserting a formatted USB drive into their car before they enable Sentry Mode.\n\n# [Leadership](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate-governance/management)\n\n**Elon Musk - CEO**\n\nElon oversees the company's product strategy -- including the design, engineering and manufacturing of electric vehicles and battery products for consumers.
