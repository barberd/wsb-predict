I am technically contracted to a potentially affected company but in a separate department at a mid-tier level so this is not inside information because I have nothing to do with the relevant areas. I am a synthetic chemist by training fyi.  \n\n  \n\nWith that out of the way:  \n\nWhen I woke up this morning, I was bullish on primary chemicals because cheap oil = cheap feedstock from refiners. Simple. But I realised I'm an idiot a few hours ago so I've finally got around to giving you fucks a tip.  \n\nYes, Cheap oil is good for chemicals companies and chemicals companies still have solid sales. Good news all round right?  \n\nNo. This is where I realized that I was retarded. Chemical companies buy specialty oil ***By-Products***. No refinery specifically refines oil for middle and upper value-chain chemicals, they refine oil for gasoline, nat gas, naphtha and kerosine. These oil derivatives make profit. The bitumen is basically a gift that road pavers take away for free, and some of the more specific mid-molecular-weight products that come out fairly pure can be sold onto the chemical industry also at a significant profit.  \n\nSo first order math says with cheaper oil you get cheaper Pentane, Benzene, Furan and semi-saturated short-chain hydrocarbons etc etc. *But that's not the case* ***AT ALL***.  \n\n  \n\nIf nobody needs gasoline (c8), kerosine (c10) or Heating oils (c12-14) and there's nowhere to store it, then you can't do any refining. You can't refine, then you can't have byproducts like the high-value high-purity feedstocks for low-to-mid value-chain chemical companies. Worse, their storage capacity is even less than the refined stockpiles: These products are even *more* flammable and volatile and because of their sales / production volumes the companies don't need to carry more than a few days of storage. When refining dries up they dry up almost immediately. So collapsing refining volume fucks them very very quickly and their feed prices go up 5x to 10x. They don't hedge by the way and pay spot evaluated a couple times a week although they will negotiate and make purchasing decisions to take advantage of short-term variation. \n\nWhat I'm suggesting is a short trade that won't last very long - the supply chain at refiners will adapt eventually because the margins that the chemicals guys can pay are better than the ones an american commuter can pay for gasoline. However, for May there is the potential for a serious hit and probably a significant hit to production due to a lack of quality raw materials, if not a total drought.  \n\nIdeas to short: DuPont, Merck, Dow, Exxon (surprise double play!). Sell down 10% with leverage relative to market expectations but not much more. I'm short Dupont and One of the others. \n\nTurns out during this research I found out that the USA is a total bitch in the chemicals market and Europe and Asia have every large player except for the ones above. Luckily we don't also have a totally fucked oil market so don't bother shorting non-USA players because we also have governments that aren't completely fucking insane.", "created_utc": 1587499576.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5mkfd/midchain_chemicals_suffer_not_gain_my_revelation/", "is_self": true}
