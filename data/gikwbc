{"id": "gikwbc", "title": "Cheese Futures: Puts on PZZA and my local Manchengo prices", "selftext": "A while ago here there was some [decent DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9bqqw/the_cheesy_collapse_of_papa_johns_dominos_pizza/) about shorting PZZA once the price of cheese reached $2/block (on [cheese market news](http://www.cheesemarketnews.com/markets/dailymarkets.html)). So anyway this price has appeared to rise steadily, it's gone up 20 cents since I've checked it, just a little each day. Anyway I was recently snacking on some Manchengo.. usually buying this for our household is like 3-4 dollars, maybe 5, but this time the block was $7.8 dollars. Take that for what you will: Short Papa John's, buy cheese futures contracts, or just hoard some literal cheddar.\n\nI'm not super confident in this I know it's shit DD but I am doing it on paper bc I'm weak. Godspeed fellow autists. I also am paper trading live cattle futures bc why not.", "created_utc": 1589319071.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gikwbc/cheese_futures_puts_on_pzza_and_my_local/", "is_self": true}
