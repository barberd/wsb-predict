{"id": "gai5jy", "title": "QQQ Breakout or Descent?", "selftext": "QQQ - already nearly retraced its way back to the highs.  Can it hit 237 again?  Possibly.  Tech is up on stupid strength but \n\nmost of the earnings steam in tech is blowing off by the end of this week and maybe if you want to stretch it - into middle of the next week. The common trend is that many were bid up into earnings and while some rallied hard after hours like FB and MSFT this is no guarantee.  \n\n[Stochs indicate overbought but then again they have been saying that since the end of March.  RSI breaking 80 would be a better indicator.  QQQ also broke out above both the 50 and 200 MA about 2 weeks ago.](https://preview.redd.it/qo7p2p95ptv41.png?width=1345&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec0e956adc5f7dd8a99f4ee20e92280667290907)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[No Chart pattern on P and F.  ](https://preview.redd.it/s8veiq3eptv41.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=2dc8451799cb6b4bbf817ca45d2dda5b9bc80de3)\n\nPositions: Cash gang currently.  I rode QQQ May 1 calls from 215 to 220 (intraday) these past 3 days.  No plans to reopen new positions although if QQQ it could retest the 50% retracement levels.", "created_utc": 1588195676.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gai5jy/qqq_breakout_or_descent/", "is_self": true}
