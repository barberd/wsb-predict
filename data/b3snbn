That was Money that my grand-grand-parents saved all my life to give me a good start to adulthood. What should I say? I invested it into AMD as well as MSCI-World. My family screamed at me and i got hated how i could do something like that.\n\nWell, now my current balance is 10k and i have an even better start for my life.
