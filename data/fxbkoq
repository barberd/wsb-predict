Last quarter they had the [biggest earnings beat in their history](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/02/26/clearwater-paper-corp-clw-q4-2019-earnings-call-tr.aspx). Even before the coronavirus, toilet paper sales grew over 8% leading to earnings of $0.37 on an expected $0.16. These sales were partially offset by a decline in paper board products which has now boomed.\n\nThey're working at full capacity trying to meet the [massive increase in demand](https://www.shelbystar.com/news/20200331/clearwater-paper-sees-increase-in-demand) they're currently seeing.
