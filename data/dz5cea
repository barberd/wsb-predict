So I\u2019m going to give you guys my Black Friday trades so y\u2019all can trade against me because I lose every single fucking time. On Wednesday next week before market close I\u2019m going to be loading up on OTM calls on $WMT, $TGT, and $BBY 11/29 EXP. I\u2019ll sell them on Friday and load up on $AMZN OTM calls 12/6 EXP which I\u2019ll sell on Cyber Monday. Do what you want with this information but trust me there\u2019s literally no way I\u2019m making money.", "created_utc": 1574271408, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dz5cea/inside_scoop/", "is_self": true}
