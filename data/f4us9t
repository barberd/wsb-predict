There is a massive gap in value between companies taking up the majority of the S&amp;P 500's value and everyone else. If cap-weighted S&amp;P outperforms or aligns with equal-weighted S&amp;P, this tells you that riskier small cap stocks in the S&amp;P are not giving the returns you would expect them to based on how much riskier they are compared to large cap stocks. This holds at least as far back as '93. This is despite the fact that \"risky\" sectors such as biotech, experimental technology, alternative media or non-mega-market retail have grown 4x since at least 2010. Millenials are speculating much more than previous generations, but not in the stock market as much as previous generations (they are doing it in other industries, like bitcoin, OnlyFans, and Brazzers subscriptions), and are not being swayed to invest by the government and instead use their leftover income to buy whatever the latest Chinese mobile app tells them to buy. \n\nThis means there is a lot of capital waiting to be injected into the stock market, and when you factor in that boomers who have their funds tied up in \"safe\" ETFs are starting to die off, the Fed is going to start making aggressive changes to entice the next generations to put that money back into the market. When millenials do start putting money in, they may be attracted to larger returns. This can go both ways - more money in more risky companies or more money in derivatives on top of safer companies. The first will overvalue many sectors, the second will overvalue the derivatives market. Both will cause a bubble, so a sort of bad-worst option here, but shows we're nowhere near the point where shit starts going downhill.\n\nTL;DR: Bull market will likely continue for a long time, then will crash because the Fed will breed gamblers who want to turn a quick profit in a desperate attempt to circulate money back into the markets.\n\n(https://seekingalpha.com/article/4116278-s-and-p-500-market-cap-vs-equal-weighting)\n\n(https://etfdb.com/etf/XLY/#charts)\n\n(https://etfdb.com/etf/XRT/#charts)\n\n(https://etfdb.com/etf/IBB/#charts)\n\n(https://www.cobizmag.com/Business-Insights/Millennials-vs-Boomers-Investment-Trends/)", "created_utc": 1581877846, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f4us9t/the_only_direction_left_is_up/", "is_self": true}
