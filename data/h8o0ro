{"id": "h8o0ro", "title": "15 trades to a million wsb game", "selftext": "This is targeted to everyone, the poors and non-poors. The idea is that if you double every trade for 15 trades, you can make $1m+.\n\nYou retards are probably thinking \"fuck off\". No, you fuck off since your peasant ass brain is smooth like a car driving on oil that is on ice going down a 45 degree hill.\n\n***Risk is the cost for ultimate rewards.***\n\nI'll break it down for you in chart form:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Start|50|\n|:-|:-|\n|1|100|\n|2|200|\n|3|400|\n|4|800|\n|5|1600|\n|6|3200|\n|7|6400|\n|8|12800|\n|9|25600|\n|10|51200|\n|11|102400|\n|12|204800|\n|13|409600|\n|14|819200|\n|15|1,638,400|\n\nThe plan, we work together to conduct top quality DD and agree on a trade to enter in and stick to it. The goal is a 100% gain and you can set up limit orders to close out.  **Patience and discipline is key for this.** Obviously if you make more than 300%(or whatever) then you can just skip a leg of the trade and move up. Weekly options would be the ideal focus. If some of you do make a decent amount and scared to continue, then realize it and go pay your bullshit bills.\n\nWe would stick to highly liquid and options(SPY, VIX, VXX and whatever else:  [https://www.barchart.com/options/most-active/etfs](https://www.barchart.com/options/most-active/etfs)), later on when we're in the 7+ tier, we can move onto SPX, TSLA, AMZN that are \\~$30+ near the money.\n\nYou just need $50(if you don't have it, I don't understand why you wouldn't...go steal it then?? Maybe visit Atlanta?). Obviously you can start with whatever you want to start with. This is something to see how far you can go with some patience and discipline. If losses are realized, then the position must be re-evaluated and you just move forward. It's common sense.\n\nIf you have eyes and a brain, we're obviously in a volatile, \"kangaroo\" type of market.\n\nLet me know your thoughts about it. If we get enough people that's onboard, then we can discuss further.\n\n^(Another user recommended this, so if it goes big, all the credit and awards shall go to him..)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# EDIT(3:08est):\n\nIt seems like a lot of you are down for this. I'll reemphasize, the point is to have patience and discipline. We're going for 100% gain trades. Additionally, there are many people who have been posting up some quality DD. If we work together, we can get this done.\n\nFor people who are genuinely interested, we need to set up some type of discord group or some shit where we can discuss plays and share DD info.\n\nTo address the larger trades(tier 8+), yes, there will be high risk but as I mentioned, SPX, TSLA, AMZN are good movers. Someone also mentioned retaining a certain amount in profit. Yes, that is fine too if you want to mitigate risk, but the goal is to reach the $1m+ mark.\n\nI must mention, being considerate for the ones who can't day trade, maybe save your 3 day trades in the event that you hit 100%+ and need to close out. It's up to you though. I rather close out at 100% than try to risk it hitting 240% skipping a few tiers.\n\nSome of you are doubtful, regardless, I genuinely hope we can make some millionaires here on wsb. Imagine being on Bloomberg, WSJ, CNBC, etc..\n\nI'm going to workout now, I'll make a discord group later. I never used it so I'll figure that shit out.", "created_utc": 1592112749.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h8o0ro/15_trades_to_a_million_wsb_game/", "is_self": true}
