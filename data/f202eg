I think $2k? Everyone nowadays has a phone. And thats all thats needed along with a stationary bike at home or the one at the gym.\n\nAll the customer has to do is download the app. Pay $20 for a monthly subscription. Easy.\n\nNow you dont just get the rich $BECKY involved. You get the poor $STACEY into this market along with the Chinese and the Europeans who cant afford a $2k bike because they are paying too much in tax. \n\nIPO in 3 years time.
