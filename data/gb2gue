{"id": "gb2gue", "title": "60 x SPY 5/1 292.5c", "selftext": "Not a huge Yolo by any means but I\u2019m expecting a massive pump from AMZN earnings. AAPL earnings will probably be awful but still moon anyway. I\u2019ve been playing the swings all day and made ~6k already selling the 291c I bought at the bottom. \n\nI\u2019m hoping to get out of this position before close and buy 100 289 puts expiring tomorrow. There I\u2019ll be blood at close tomorrow or I\u2019ll do something embarrassing and submit it here.\n\nPosting this now in case anyone wants to buy in before close. Don\u2019t miss out.\n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/5rIHhS1", "created_utc": 1588275037.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gb2gue/60_x_spy_51_2925c/", "is_self": true}
