Every sovereign nation lights a fuse under their oil fields (figuratively) and creates a situation where reopening wells/fields is going to take months if not years?\n\nThen what? Oil spikes?\n\nHave you staved off bankruptcy for a slew of producers who have as-of-yet nowhere to sell to? Does that cost-push inflation actually help anyone?\n\nWhat's the way out of this? How do you apply the same quick adrenaline injection that JP did for commodities markets?", "created_utc": 1587470806.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5e0gv/game_theory_for_equivalent_of_oil_price/", "is_self": true}
