{"id": "hagvya", "title": "Could Either of These Companies Get Us Over the Mountain of Past R&D Failures?", "selftext": "**Summary:** Denali Therapeutics (NASDAQ: DNLI) and Alector (NASDAQ: ALEC) are two high-profile companies taking a new angle on neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (PD & AD), notoriously tough nuts to crack. We are cautiously excited about a handful of innovative companies including the two highlighted here (we also previously wrote about Passage Bio (NASDAQ: PASG), a gene therapy CNS player we took a position in).ALEC leverages association studies to identify genetic targets and biomarkers for immuno-neurology therapies. DNLI also takes a genetically-driven approach to target selection, and possesses a proprietary blood-brain barrier (BBB) transport platform. A look at their pipelines reveals some overlapping targets (progranulin in FTD, TREM2 in AD), reflecting the similar philosophical starting point for these companies. This article will focus on the case for and against DNLI.  \n\n\n**Denali | Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **We are cautiously excited about DNLI\u2019s pipeline and drug delivery platform, but do not expect to see durable upside in the near-term at the current valuation.**\n* **We value DNLI at \\~$5.4B versus a current market cap of \\~$2.9B based on programs with initial clinical data by 2020 (DNL201 or DNL151 in PD, DNL747 in AD and ALS).** Crucially, DNLI has not partnered out their PD program, which has peak sales potential of \\~$9B, bolstering the company valuation. This also does not include the potential of their earlier-stage programs or the value of their drug delivery platform itself.\n* Given the expected time to clinic and a discount rate of 11 - 13%, we are setting a 12 month price target of $30 - 35, **reflecting \\~20% upside to the current price of $27.83.**\n* **DNLI offers some modest near-term potential inflection points** in advancing to P2/P3 trial in PD (either DNL201 or DNL151) and a P1 readout for their Sanofi-partnered AD program in the coming months, and may also benefit indirectly from the clinical proof of concept for competitor programs with shared targets (e.g., PGRN, TREM2).\n* **While upside exists for DNLI, the upside at the current price point is not sufficient for WX Capital to initiate a position in the company.**\n\n**The Case for DNLI:**\n\n* ***Potential first-to-market disease-modifying therapy in Parkinson\u2019s Disease:*** Current agents used in PD are limited to symptom-mitigation, whereas theoretically DNLI\u2019s LRRK2-targeting agents could slow degeneration itself. The current PD global market is worth approximately $5B U.S., indicating a substantial opportunity exists for a disease-modifying treatment. Overall we model a \\~$9B peak sales opportunity in PD with \\~14% PTRS assuming DNLI is the only disease-modifying therapy available (Biogen\u2019s BIIB054 P2 trial in PD is expected to readout 2H20, and would be a key competitor).\n* ***Well-pedigreed leadership and investor team, multiple validating strategic industry partnerships, and strong cash position:*** DNLI\u2019s leadership team is largely composed of Genentech veterans, widely considered one of the more reputable and scientifically-rigorous companies in the industry. DNLI also has several bluechip investors behind them such as ARCH and Flagship. Furthermore, DNLI secured two large cornerstone partnerships with large companies in Takeda and Sanofi. The Takeda deal covers preclinical programs in FTD-GRN (DNL-593, recombinant progranulin) and AD (ATV:TREM2 and ATV:Tau) and earned DNLI $150M upfront. The Sanofi deal ($125M upfront) covers DNL747 and DNL758, small molecule drugs targeting RIPK1 in P1 for neurological (AD, ALS, MS) and peripheral inflammatory diseases (RA, psoriasis), respectively. DNLI currently has \\~$595M in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.\n* ***Platform includes both brain-penetrant small molecules and antibodies:*** On aggregate, we prefer DNLI\u2019s technology platform given it encompasses both antibodies and brain-penetrant small molecules. In general an oral option will win out over an infused biologic assuming broadly comparable efficacy, and we believe this dynamic would be only more acute in a neurodegenerative population. Therefore, while DNLI\u2019s most advanced AD asset DNL747 is slightly trailing ALEC\u2019s programs, all else being equal we prefer DNL747 given its ROA. We are also excited about the RIPK1 target\u2019s potential across multiple indications both in and out of CNS, which we believe derisks its overall clinical development.\n* ***DNLI\u2019s blood-brain-barrier (BBB) drug delivery platform itself has meaningful value:*** DNLI has also invested in a proprietary delivery platform based on leveraging the transferrin receptor to improve CNS-targeted delivery of large molecules (e.g., antibodies and enzymes). This technology underlies their AD programs. We have the same pathway concerns for their PGRN-targeting FTD programs and TREM2-targeting AD programs as we discussed for ALEC. However, we would be interested to see how DNLI\u2019s delivery platform could potentially enable more efficient trafficking to the brain and thus allow for lower systemic dosing, improving the overall product profile for similar targets.\n\n**The Case Against DNLI:**\n\n* ***$2.9B market cap and lack of near-term catalysts does not provide predictable upside at this time:*** We model a \\~$9B opportunity in PD (\\~$1.3B PTRS-adjusted) and a \\~$3B opportunity in AD (\\~$315M PTRS-adjusted). DNLI is entitled to 50% of the AD program profits. Using a peak sales multiple of 3.5 - 4x, we assign DNLI a risk-adjusted valuation of $5.4B by approximately 2025, discounting to a 12-month price target of $30 - 35 (\\~20% upside to current price of $27.83).\n* ***Fairly early-stage clinical pipeline in high-risk indications:*** As a general observation, DNLI\u2019s pipeline is quite early-stage and as noted previously CNS development is extremely challenging. We do not have much by way of derisking proof-of-concept data at this point, so believe the PTRS for each program is in the 10 - 20% range, similar to ALEC. Additionally, DNL201 faced a partial clinical hold in P1 trials due to preclinical toxicity data, though this was ultimately removed.\n* ***Limited near-term inflection points:*** In contrast to ALEC, we do not foresee many inflection points in the next 12 months. Some milestones that are on the horizon include advancing a PD program to P2/3 (DNL201 or DNL151), P1 updates on their AD/ALS program (DNL747), and initiation of a P1/2 trial in MPS II (DNL310). We also would not be surprised to see updates from the Sanofi-led DNL758 program in peripheral inflammation or on other early-stage programs, but do not anticipate many other needle-moving events.\n\n**Disclosure:** We do not own shares of Alector or Denali Therapeutics.
