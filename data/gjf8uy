Or have people bought it assuming the fed will buy it?  I mean, has it come to this, total moral hazard and a crazy dysfunctional market?\n\nOr is my weak MS Paint skills completely missing the point and there is really not functional correlation between the  **CMBX 6**  and CMBS etf?\n\nI was going to try to figure it out for myself, but it's way beyond my limited IQ and there are some very clueful MBS folks lurking around here..\n\nGuess this is why:   [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/agency-commercial-mortgage-backed-securities/agency-commercial-mortgage-backed-securities-operations](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/agency-commercial-mortgage-backed-securities/agency-commercial-mortgage-backed-securities-operations)\n\nAhh, \"multi family homes.\"  So not necessarily malls and offices, but rental properties for voters to live in.  That makes sense now.  Don't want to mess with that.\n\nPlus the ETF looks like a dividend spewing ETF, I'm sure a lot of older folks rely on it to pay their bills.   I can imagine the fed bailing out that early and often.\n\nIf you look at the holdings, you see stuff like  FHMS at the top.  FHMS is -  The guaranteed classes are also under FHMS shelf in Bloomberg (Freddie Mac Multifamily Structured Pass-Through K-Certificates)Yeah, multifamily, don't want to short that.  Hope it doesn't implode.  \n\n\n [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239459/ishares-cmbs-etf](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239459/ishares-cmbs-etf) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mnrggjxwqny41.png?width=1474&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a1d1c71d126215b88946829d5c18343b6f62f56", "created_utc": 1589430363.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gjf8uy/eli5_why_has_ishares_mbs_diverged_from_mbx_market/", "is_self": true}
