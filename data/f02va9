{"id": "f02va9", "title": "Short squeeze on PTON?", "selftext": "Just wondering what you fucking retards are thinking about PTON right now? I felt like today it was definitely over sold for what was a pretty strong ER with only a minor hit to guidance (and possibly an early end to a share lock up). I\u2019m obviously retarded myself so I bought 2/28 calls @ 30.00 strike today because I feel like it may have the rest of the week to fizzle a bit but in the next week or so may retrace back up to a little bit above $30 when people realize this ER/guidance was pretty much already priced in. I\u2019m probably wrong so please sell me more calls and make those sweet tendies. \n\nTL;DR Do you artists think PTON is just oversold right now or fundamentally down? And don\u2019t say \u201cbuy MSFT calls instead.\u201d Listen hear you fucks, I\u2019m clearly already retarded so yes obviously I have MSFT calls already.", "created_utc": 1581038656, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f02va9/short_squeeze_on_pton/", "is_self": true}
