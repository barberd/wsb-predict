So I'm down over 99% on the all time chart and I've been pretty consistently choosing plays that seem practical but keep losing money. I'm buying what I think are sensible options, usually close to itm and several weeks out, but continue to rack up loss after loss. I'd ballpark my win rate over the last 2 months at around 15%. The good news though is that I'm going to share my plays with you so that you know to avoid them or, if you're feeling confident, inverse them and hopefully make some tendies. Let's get into it.\n\n1) Amd puts. \n\nAn obvious one. Their p/e is absurd, the stock is overbought and the semi sector is cyclical in nature. Surely, this stock is due for a correction sooner rather than later.\nMy play 37p 12/06\nInversion: 40c 12/06\n\n2) ACB calls.\n\nDown 35% in one week? A bounce has got to be coming. It just has to. So oversold on the RSI. Plus we're very close to the point where everybody who's gonna sell because of earnings has sold, and once that happens this shit has got to recover. It was at $8 just a few months ago. If it holds support around 2.20 in the next couple days I could see a bounce back to $4 within the next couple weeks. A positive catalyst like legalization talk in the upcoming democratic debates could slingshot it back to the $6 range easily. Easily!\nMy play 2.5c 11/22\nInverse: 1.5p early 2020\n\n3) Smiledirectclub calls.\n\nA true market disrupter. They offer what traditional orthodontristry offers at a 40% discount, and the current lawsuits against them claiming they are practicing orthodontristry without the correct licenses have little merit. This stock was at $13 just a week ago and ended the day today just above 8. The dip seems to be because of their earnings report, which they actually beat on. What investors didn't like was the amount they're spending on marketing, which will lengthen their timeframe toward profitability. I think the stock was unfairly punished and have a lot of conviction that this shits gonna moon any day now.\nMy play: 12.5c 12/20\nInversion: 7.5p 12/20", "created_utc": 1574117738, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dyb47d/i_pick_options_so_you_can_inverse_me/", "is_self": true}
