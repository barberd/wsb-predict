I don't know exactly why, I'm no general, maybe because of weather conditions and so on.\n\nThe thing is, given weapon manufacturers such as LMT and NOC are at a discount right now, it would be a good idea to buy some slightly OTM calls for June. \n\nIf tensions arise, you'll make tons of free money. If nothing happens, you most probably won't lose money anyway.\n\nTomorrow I'll load some LMT and NOC calls for June.", "created_utc": 1583087406, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fby9cy/big_tendies_idea_buy_now_weapon_manufactures/", "is_self": true}
