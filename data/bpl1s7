I will owe taxes on a shit ton of trades with teensy, tiny, OP's penis sized gains. But on top of that my accountant will have to stay late after banging my mom (and also wants a new yacht) so he ups my charge from normie tax filing rate to options trading screechtard tax filing rate.\n\nAfter the gubment slaps my meager capital gains with it's wet dick of theft, my accountant throat rapes the rest of my \"capital gains\" as payment for his \"*blood sweat and tears*\" thus making my very small year end \"profit\" *less* profitable than being picked down by a large net loss (tax write off) at the end of the year?\n\nBasically if I don't lose enough (\ud83d\udc3b gang style) to lower my taxes, I better make more than enough profit after taxes to pay my fat cat accountant for filing my \"super complicated trading paperwork\"?\n\nWhat if I never withdraw, but just leave the money with my brokerage year after year, do I not have to report anything because the money is still tied up in securities/options/buying power?", "created_utc": 1558056783, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bpl1s7/taxes_and_other_gross_things/", "is_self": true}
