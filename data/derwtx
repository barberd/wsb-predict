{"id": "derwtx", "title": "Anyone notice how FOX and FOXA are labeled wrong?", "selftext": "Normally class A shares are voting and class B are non-voting. In the case of Fox, class A shares  (FOXA) are non-voting (you gotta look for that one line in the 10-K that outlines it; very easy to miss). Class B shares (FOX), the shit Murdoch and his runts own, are voting. \n\nWhen trading started, FOX was correctly trading at a higher price, but since then it got inverted since everyone assumed FOXA are the voting shares and should trade at a premium (wrong). \n\nIf any of y\u2019all are bankers, I would like a $5B margin loan. I\u2019ll short FOXA and long FOX (0 economic exposure) and then wreak havoc at the AGM dressed up as Joker or something.", "created_utc": 1570492060, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/derwtx/anyone_notice_how_fox_and_foxa_are_labeled_wrong/", "is_self": true}
