{"id": "eykwh9", "title": "Question for you options obsessed autists", "selftext": "I want to learn more about options, even if they are not available to me due to lack of funds (I just opened up a brokerage account with TDA and it has $50 on it I play with while learning the market). I\u2019ve read the FAQ, and I\u2019m researching past that, but wanted some actual examples to look at to help visualize what I learn. \n\nJust to make sure I\u2019m not a god damn retard and have my shit straight, options are different than actually buying stock in that each \u201coption\u201d, which is a term used for a contract that covers 100 shares of a company, is less about owning the stock, and more about \u201cbetting\u201d in which direction the company will go? It also technically had unlimited potential to go up cause stonks only go uppies, with limited downside potential in that if your option contract expires without realization you basically just lose the premium you had to pay to buy that option? \n\nAnd in this case, with options you can go two ways, you can either buy a call option, which is if you strongly believe the stock will always be rocketing to the moon like TESLA. Or you can buy a put option, which is for when you believe the stocks only direction to go is down, like the Down\u2019s syndrome most of us have; especially the bears. \n\nNow how do you capitalize on this if the option goes in the direction you wanted? It\u2019s a contract so are you essentially betting on the future of a stock, and if you\u2019re right you can buy each share at the price you originally bought the option for? So if I bought Tesla back when it was $200 and bought a single call, betting that by the end of 2019 the stock was going to be at or above $400, once that actually happened does that mean you fulfill the contract for 100 shares of Tesla and get to buy them for $200 each even though they\u2019re worth $400, doubling your money? Am I understanding it so far? \n\nWhat other ways can you make money with options? And what if you don\u2019t have the money to actualize those sweet sweet gains? Can you sell your contract to someone else who can? What happens if the stock keeps growing way past your bet? And what are the dangers of options? How much money do you need to actually exercise calls or puts? I\u2019m a poor, addlebrained college student with a part time job, and because of my extreme lack of cash flow does this mean playing with options are out of my reach (I don\u2019t plan on jumping in to them anyways, since I don\u2019t have the money to back up a bad bet)? \n\nCan you give real examples with numbers and explanations of plays you\u2019ve made that went great, or horribly?\n\nFinal question, futures seem like they\u2019re similar to options, but what are the main differences and why do most people do options instead of futures if that\u2019s the case?", "created_utc": 1580792980, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eykwh9/question_for_you_options_obsessed_autists/", "is_self": true}
