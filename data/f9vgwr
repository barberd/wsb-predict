Because I didn\u2019t exactly post here beforehand, I\u2019ll refrain from boasting anymore about it. But I will say that this trade, although long in the tooth, isn\u2019t done working.\n\nThe stocks at the top of my list for purchase include: CODX, APT, NVAX, NNVC, MRNA, VIR, and LAKE.\n\nI know with markets up these stocks are not a good idea to trade now. As long as yields are rising stocks can too. But this dynamic will be a rocky one and a V shaped recovery is out of the question.\n\nI\u2019m tempted to buy into a group of ancillary virus plays, all sharply higher like the ones above. But I think I\u2019ll wait until at least 3pm.\n\nThoughts?", "created_utc": 1582733283, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9vgwr/corona_cash_is_real_and_fun_to_take/", "is_self": true}
