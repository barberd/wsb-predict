So far pretty every decision I\u2019ve made has resulted in loosing money. I bought 32 3/20 ALLY and 55 3/20 ETSY calls at the very top on Thursday right before everything went to shit. Now I\u2019ve spent the rest of my money on VIXY calls and EWY puts and it isn\u2019t looking very good for me. \n\nHence I predict the market will I\u2019ll go up tomorrow!
