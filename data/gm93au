In the last 3 months I'm up around 12k. Some of my plays were the two big spy put drops. I'm currently in BABA calls, Cost calls and just sold my lowes calls. I'm deep in AMD calls atm\n\n\n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/7hjlnGE", "created_utc": 1589832550.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gm93au/the_comeback/", "is_self": true}
