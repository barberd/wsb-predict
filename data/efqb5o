It currently has had like an average of 55% short volume this week. The pump on this will be huge.\n\nArticle about this as well below... expect more articles to follow tomorrow when this picks up some traction:", "created_utc": 1577331886, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/efqb5o/a_blind_guy_just_broke_nda_about_acb_and_coca/", "is_self": true}
