{"id": "evsa1e", "title": "Auto Options-Placing Bots?", "selftext": "Good evening wsb,\n\nI've noticed when I trade options on RH, If I am the first person to place an option that is in between the current ask and bid prices, literally the instant I place it something around 100 other bids always pile on the exact same bid or ask price. Has anyone else experienced this? Is there a tool to make sure you don't overpay for or undersell an option that anybody can use? I'm assuming a tool like this must have some range of numbers that you would accept a buy or sell. \n\nThanks, everybody.", "created_utc": 1580328219, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/evsa1e/auto_optionsplacing_bots/", "is_self": true}
