{"id": "giehbz", "title": "Airlines Industry Economic Outlook - DD (LUV, DAL, UAL, AAL, BA)", "selftext": "Airlines are currently under harsh conditions but I think the overall long term out look is bright for strong companies such as Southwest and Delta. The reason why airlines are continuing to fall is because the bonds that were issued are at high risk and until demand starts to pick up, airlines will continue to decline. These companies are burning through cash at an extremely alarming rate but looking at airline travel data in the past few weeks, I am confident these companies will come back stronger than ever. I've bought a bunch of LUV, DAL, and BA and a few long calls on UAL and AAL just in case the government bails them the fuck out or they get acquired. What do yall think?", "created_utc": 1589300670.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/giehbz/airlines_industry_economic_outlook_dd_luv_dal_ual/", "is_self": true}
