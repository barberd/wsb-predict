If you had done the same shit to any other major index the returns should be less then spectacular. I respect both gay bears and bull, you make money by being bi-curious. What I hate is people thinking they can make money by sitting on their ass doing nth, passive income is a myth, you just happen to be lucky to born and live within at 10 years positive upcycles (fcurk boomers).\n\nThere have been many economic arguments of deflation for the future, you can just google it yourself. DCA only works when the markets continue to climb forever.  As you can see after the great depression, markets stagnated for 10 years. You ain't gonna earn shit doing DCA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4nz49zrh7m451.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=fce71b8aef0848f3aae646bce145eb5eecdb232c\n\nBear porn (3)\n\nSure, you can argue if you continue to DCA further out from 10 years, into 20 years it will surely climb right? You can keep listening to dead beat advice from dead beat investors 1 foot from the grave.\n\nWhen Buffet got out of airlines, we r/wsb bet against him and made money.When Buffet says don't bet against America, we r/wsb will switch to bears and do the same shit in march and make money.\n\nIn my humble opinion, boomers in govt have farked the future of their kids and grandkids so hard just to protect their own retirement. Nobody in govt right now will ever care (except #feelthebern) about anything beyond 4 years.\n\nThis is why Buffet is wrong. America is beginning its decline while the rest of the world is catching up.\n\n\" A society grows great when old men plant trees in whose shade they know they shall never sit. \" - Greek Proverb", "created_utc": 1592027765.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h81prg/lol_rant_post/", "is_self": true}
