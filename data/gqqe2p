You fucking single-handedly created the most bulshit easiest of shity markets in the history of the entire Market. Beer virus kills over 100000 people, spy goes up, unemployment goes beyond Great Recession levels, spy goes up, oil crashes down to negative levels, spy goes uppity uppity up up. So I hope it's fucking worth it. Not only have you caused the entire Market to make a revival, but you have also single-handedly caused the United States debt to exceed expectations. And possibly will never be able to go back to how things used to be because now we have an artificial bull market that will come crashing down the moment you decide to stop holding it up. I am a fundamental gay bear, and I'm a technical gay bull, but in this case Powell, you have single-handedly fucked me beyond my fuckable limit. I hope you're happy with yourself with what you've created you old ass man.", "created_utc": 1590467979.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gqqe2p/the_gayest_of_all_gay_bear_rants/", "is_self": true}
