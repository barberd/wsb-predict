{"id": "fux17s", "title": "Buy tanker stocks if you like tendies", "selftext": "Look I\u2019m busy as fuck because I actually YOLO stocks and commodities for a living, and while working from home is actually kinda tight, I\u2019ve got two screens instead of four. That\u2019s seriously hindering my ability to look at charts, read zero hedge, and occasionally make up some bullshit about fundamentals.\n\nSo this DD is going to be brief. Let\u2019s be honest, y\u2019all don\u2019t want details anyhow. \n\nOPEC and Russia are not fucking going to bail out US shale. The United States is not joining an oil cartel comprised mostly of our enemies. It\u2019s not going to happen. \n\nMeanwhile, global GDP is going to plunge more than any other time in the modern era. \n\nSo there an unprecedented glut in oil. \n\nThat means returns to oil storage are extraordinarily high. Which means VLCC day rates are extraordinarily high. Which means companies that own VLCCs are going to make a lot of money.\n\nBut semenbiscuit, how do you know it\u2019s not already priced in?\n\nBecause the value of a VLCC is extremely transparent. And it doesn\u2019t change all that much. So you can calculate the NAV of tanker stock on the back of box of tendies. And most of the these stocks are trading right at or even below their NAV. Go check for yourself, or just trust me. I don\u2019t care.\n\nThat means very limited downside, because they aren\u2019t going to trade far below NAV, but a shit load of potential upside. Because if day rates stay elevated (and they will) they\u2019re going to be earning ridiculous returns over the next few quarters. \n\nSome names I like: DHT, STNG, TNP, FRO. \n\nAnd yea I own a bunch in my personal accounts.
