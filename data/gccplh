{"id": "gccplh", "title": "$NAT DD: Marine Traffic Data For Each Ship", "selftext": "\nI used www.marinevesseltraffic.com to find each NAT Suezmax ship from the 20-F below. I crosschecked each ship against the year build just to be sure. It seems NAT sails their ships using 3 flags: Bahamas, Cayman Islands, and Marshall Islands. \n\n\n[NAT 2019 Form 20-F](https://www.nat.bm/category/reports/annual-reports/) - page 52\n\n\nWhile this data doesn't tell you who is contracting the ships or the value of the contracts, we can get an idea of how often NAT ships go from port to port. I'd imagine that the management is smart enough to make the most of their ships so when I see something like Nordic Cygnus's 4/11 arrival at Long Beach and no port after that, my guess is that NAT among one of the many tankers outside LB storing oil at VERY high rates.\n\n\nI also noticed that many ships are taking about 1-2 weeks between port. We can't assume those are 1-2 week contracts as perhaps they're working with a producer who has a more complex contract. Either way, we can see that their ships are moving often and plentifully. \n\n\n[Nordic Freedom](https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/NORDIC-FREEDOM-IMO-9288887-MMSI-311817000)\n\n\n[Nordic Grace](https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/NORDIC-GRACE-IMO-9230892-MMSI-319058800)\n\n\n[Nordic Cosmos](https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/NORDIC-COSMOS-IMO-9233765-MMSI-538001786)\n\n\n[Nordic Moon](https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/NORDIC-MOON-IMO-9224283-MMSI-538001711)\n\n\n[Nordic Apollo](https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/NORDIC-APOLLO-IMO-9248423-MMSI-538001820)\n\n\n[Nordic Zenith](https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/NORDIC-ZENITH-IMO-9588469-MMSI-636014869)\n\n\n[Nordic Breeze](https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/NORDIC-BREEZE-IMO-9588445-MMSI-636014868)\n\n\n[Nordic Vega](https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/NORDIC-VEGA-IMO-9412581-MMSI-311026700)\n\n\n[Nordic Passat](https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/NORDIC-PASSAT-IMO-9229386-MMSI-538003863)\n\n\n[Nordic Mistral](https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/NORDIC-MISTRAL-IMO-9233210-MMSI-538003776)\n\n\n[Nordic Skier](https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/NORDIC-SKIER-IMO-9297515-MMSI-319070500)\n\n\n[Nordic Sprinter](https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/NORDIC-SPRINTER-IMO-9297503-MMSI-319067500)\n\n\n[Nordic Luna](https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/NORDIC-LUNA-IMO-9290933-MMSI-319098500)\n\n\n[Nordic Cross](https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/NORDIC-CROSS-IMO-9438418-MMSI-538003713)\n\n\n[Nordic Light](https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/NORDIC-LIGHT-IMO-9436446-MMSI-538003862)\n\n\n[Nordic Pollux](https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/NORDIC-POLLUX-IMO-9239848-MMSI-319099500)\n\n\n[Nordic Sirius](https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/NORDIC-SIRIUS-IMO-9194995-MMSI-319099700)\n\n\n[Nordic Castor](https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/NORDIC-CASTOR-IMO-9303247-MMSI-319099600)\n\n\n[Nordic Aquarius](https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/NORDIC-AQUARIUS-IMO-9818216-MMSI-319130700)\n\n\n[Nordic Space](https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/NORDIC-SPACE-IMO-9748681-MMSI-319095200)\n\n\n[Nordic Star](https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/NORDIC-STAR-IMO-9748679-MMSI-319095100)\n\n\n[Nordic Cygnus](https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/NORDIC-CYGNUS-IMO-9818228-MMSI-319130800)\n\n[Nordic Tellus](https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/NORDIC-TELLUS-IMO-9818230-MMSI-319131300)", "created_utc": 1588449223.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gccplh/nat_dd_marine_traffic_data_for_each_ship/", "is_self": true}
