Are they stupid or what? Let's think about it for a second.\n\nThere are two possible outcomes here:\n\n* Let's say you do some leverage, and then use that leverage to lose 100k+, they can eat the loss briefly, and then they use collection agents to collect YOUR money. Robinhood will earn 100k$\n* You use the same leverage to gain 100k+, then, when you go to cash out to your bank, their audit team blocks the payment, saying that you \"Violated the Terms of Service\", by using a bug to make that amount of money. Thus, robinhood pockets 100k$. You can't sue them to get that money back, because you violated their TOS.\n\nIf I was Robinhood CEO, that's what I would do, a 100% legal, safe way to get rich quickly.\n\nProve me wrong.", "created_utc": 1572980957, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ds3w7o/what_if_robinhood_is_truly_genious/", "is_self": true}
