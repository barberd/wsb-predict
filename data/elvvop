{"id": "elvvop", "title": "Capital Losses Tax Carryover", "selftext": "I'm aware that if your net losses outweigh your net gains then you can carry this over to the next tax year. However, to my understanding, it's limited to only 3k. I literally lost 22k last year and, this tax year, I'm up 22k (thanks to BYND!). How do my taxes work? If everything stands, does this mean I pay tax for my 19k (22k - 3k deductible) in short term capital gains? Any information would be appreciated!
