{"id": "b56pxt", "title": "(Charts) 5 bullish trades for anyone feeling uneasy about the next quarter.", "selftext": "I believe the market is going to go into consolidation heading into the next quarter- (a lot of ping pong). If SPY decides to pull back though, these will work better. I am selling OTM calls to collect on premium - best case they all drop and I buy back in 2 weeks. Most the time I just have to wait out the consolidation and let them expire.  Either way HIGH POP - but don't be surprised if a few test your patience. You can easily sell Verticals too if you don't want undefined risk. \n\n [https://imgur.com/a/LWwD7Rf](https://imgur.com/a/LWwD7Rf) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTMUS - consolidated for the last month  - but still hanging on to the gains is made.\n\nPCAR-  likes to pull back hard from it's highs -  look at the chart \n\nINSM- perfect double top formed in the last month with a 10% range - just broke it.  \n\nDUK-  i've never had a losing trade with duke - maybe this will be my first. also feels good to bet against these assholes\n\nGLPI- i'm entering this earlier then I normally would but given current sentiment about the market i'm hoping it can shake it down a bit. Normally would wait for it to re test the highs or break the range. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "created_utc": 1553492106, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b56pxt/charts_5_bullish_trades_for_anyone_feeling_uneasy/", "is_self": true}
