I've been trading stocks and options for five or six years now and this is very unusual, as most of us know. So I started digging into it, and [learned a lot from this article from November of last year](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/22/the-stock-market-and-its-fear-gauge-vix-are-moving-in-unison.html).\n\nIn essence, the price of the VIX is primarily controlled by purchases of puts. The more puts are purchased, the more fear people have in the market. So right now, big money is purchasing fewer puts even with values dropping. Weird, right? Well the authors think that it's a sign of naivete and is setting us up for disaster. And by us, I mean the collective economy. SO! Don't put your head in the sand--wait for Thursday's jobless claims report and LET'S SEE WHAT'S UP. Probably not the VIX.", "created_utc": 1584991762.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fnq7pb/whats_up_with_the_vix/", "is_self": true}
