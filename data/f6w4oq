I wanted to post a follow up and ask who is going to be going in today? They were unaffected by this flash crash and his prediction was $15 next week. So $15 2/28 for those who just want the strike and price. I have about 5k from Spce I want to turn into 10k so those who know dd and read it well I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts! Or if you have a better strike and price on a different ticker or this one that\u2019s safer for me I really need a win so I can pay off some serious life changing debt that will have me trapped for years if I can\u2019t solve it now.
