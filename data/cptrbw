{"id": "cptrbw", "title": "$M Macy\u2019s DD", "selftext": "So basically my gf mom loves Macy\u2019s but she says lately they have been shitty with their rewards program and they hiked the prices on so much stuff. A coach bag that is $250 online is now $300 at Macy\u2019s. She discovered $ULTA and no longer goes to Macy\u2019s to get her perfumes and bags. Now she\u2019s going around Facebook and inviting other GenX moms to go shop at ULTA with a promo code she has or whatever. And she even convinced her husband to add ULTA shares to his 401k or whatever. She\u2019s in the process of canceling her MACYS Credit card now. So basically I might long Ulta and GenX moms and short Macy\u2019s and Boomers.", "created_utc": 1565705868, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cptrbw/m_macys_dd/", "is_self": true}
