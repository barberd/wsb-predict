{"id": "feg8z9", "title": "Technical Update - Most likely scenario is upward rising wedge and then collapse", "selftext": "**Warning:** please note that these are simply my own working models and probability assumptions. As a guide, I position \\~10% of my capital into these trades and stop out losses if the working model no longer works.\n\nMy operating assumption is that you need to think in a fractal way. Everything is a bear trap which is a bull trap which is a bear trap. So your operating model should be about how will both bears and bulls get trapped in different time frames (daily, weekly, monthly, etc).\n\nIf you think shit will hit the fan, there will be a bull trap to get everyone to one side of the trade before it tops over. You need to also think about how the crash will be the fertile ground for a decade long rally.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/yVpnGuN](https://imgur.com/a/yVpnGuN)\n\nIt looks like I was wrong on the inverted H&S. I was expecting a quicker retracement and subsequent collapse thereafter. This means that the collapse will come later than I expect.\n\nI think the most likely scenario now is that we form 2 weeks of a rising wedge before a subsequent collapse down perhaps even more than the first leg down and could potentially send VIX to the 70-90 range.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/IQPMPKc](https://imgur.com/a/IQPMPKc)\n\nIf you want to buy puts, i would set them at the late march to April expiry.\n\nIf you want to buy calls and time the short term reversals, I would set them ATM and and maybe a week out at most.\n\nI hold 20-30k worth of 3/13 calls and hedged with 200k in short position and 20k in VIX calls strike 30-40 exp March 25-April 15.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Update 2:00pm: Looks like we are hovering around the bottom of the wedge, if we break the previous low reached on the 28th then down we go** ", "created_utc": 1583513388.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/feg8z9/technical_update_most_likely_scenario_is_upward/", "is_self": true}
