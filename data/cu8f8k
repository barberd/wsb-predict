{"id": "cu8f8k", "title": "Short Canadian bond market in around 15 years", "selftext": "This stems from a few sources: CIBC and RBC investor relations, Sienna, Extendicare, and Rivera investor relations, a few books, and anecdotal experience.\n\nCanada is in a problem.\n\nSenior and assisted living residences are not only unattainably expensive for anyone but FD Champs, but there are almost decade long waitlists. In around 15 years, a huge portion of the population will be seniors. These seniors will deplete the government pension plans (oas and cpp) which already pay out mediocrelly. This will make senior living even less of a possibility.\n\nSeniors thamelves don't work and don't pay tax, or really do anything useful at all to society. When they're old and too poor for AL, their kids will have to take time out of being a productive citizen to help change their shit napkins and ensure they pop their morning xans. The children will be spending more money and time for this, depleting their own savings and deterring their time away from a job which would oblige them to pay tax on.\n\nOn top of this, people are having less kids so the population of working individuals will decrease still. The gov pension plans will deplete and will be hardly re-upped. Not to mention gen z is a colassal fuck up. \n\nMoving on to banking, sketchy debt and huge mortgages to fund the insanely expensive urban houses are on the rise. Canadians also have very low savings relative to their incomes.\n\nCanada's gdp is diverse but Trudeau cares more about the pride parades than making meaningful progress with Mango. Seriously when was the last time Justin was on the news. I nearly forgot who was PM.\n\nShits not looking good.\n\nShort Canadian bonds in anctiparion of the boomer fueled slide.", "created_utc": 1566531793, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cu8f8k/short_canadian_bond_market_in_around_15_years/", "is_self": true}
