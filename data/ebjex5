{"id": "ebjex5", "title": "YouTube COPPA changes and NFLX/DIS", "selftext": "Why is no one here talking about the effect of the COPPA changes on YouTube streaming for kids and the opportunity that means for Disney+ and Netflix? In the new year there is going to be an Armageddon for streaming kids content creators on YouTube. \n\nI get this isn't a sexy pump and dump, but the fact that YouTube will no longer auto play kids videos one after the other or offer suggestions for what to watch next will probably erase them from the kids content market. \n\nIt makes Netflix and Disney+ pretty much uncontested for kids streaming starting January 1st. With Disney+ being new, and it being the Christmas season, it should help significantly with new subscribers and reduce any cancellation numbers as well.\n\nMaybe it is because people on this sub can't procreate, so they aren't aware of how much kids watch YouTube now? I guess the mods at least have adoption or surrogacy as an option, so there really aren't any excuses for this blind spot in analysis.\n\nAlso, are there any short options because of this? Will it hurt toymakers who can no longer rely on hidden marketing through unboxing videos to push their toys to kids?", "created_utc": 1576522751, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ebjex5/youtube_coppa_changes_and_nflxdis/", "is_self": true}
