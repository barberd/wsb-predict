But guess what.. if my YOLO $SPY options started printing... My balance would\u2019ve EASILY tripled to 2million+. I would\u2019ve then proceeded to buy MULTIPLE lambos which is the only responsible thing to do. All jokes aside, i did indeed lose most of my net worth but the world WILL NOT end. I still have some money on the side that will 100% be deposited into RobinHood. And i will make a final run for the believers in this forum... I will give updates in the months to come. People calling me dumb for doing so have less than $5 to their name so idgaf. I\u2019m about to unplug Jpows money printer and send my $SPY puts to the fucking moon. Hopefully it ain\u2019t running on daddy Elon\u2019s solar panels. I appreciate the people who genuinely wish the best for me and hope for a comeback story.. I also do appreciate the people trying to save my ass from losing the rest of my tendies by calling me a retard gambler because you are correct. I am aware i have a problem and if i lose the rest of my net worth i genuinely do not give a flying fuck. I\u2019ll flip some burgers for 10 years then do this shit show all over again. I don\u2019t need anyone to wish me luck or call me stupid, i\u2019m doing what i believe in \ud83d\udc3b\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50\ud83d\udc3b BTW. Yes this shit is real, some of y\u2019all just value paper that Jpow prints out of his ass to much.", "created_utc": 1587820377.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7tb39/65677911_balance_before_going_to_0_in_one_month/", "is_self": true}
