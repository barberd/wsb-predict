Closures are just getting started: SXSW, conferences, concerts, sports, schools and businesses. Assuming things continue (and there is zero reason to expect otherwise), some broad economic hits are primed to happen: less spending, less activity, less cheap corporate debt.\n\nThe opportunity NOW is cheap puts on companies with corporate debt imbalances or reliant on positive growth to survive. Any company that can't survive a shitty quarter or two without capital infusion is going porkbelly up (or close enough to move the needle sharply in the short term).\n\nRecognize this has nothing to do with beer virus killing us all and everything to do with *people fearing the beer virus*. If beer virus comes, everything is tanking anyway. But no matter what, the tide is receding and some broken boats are going to be exposed.\n\nAny recs?", "created_utc": 1583606195.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fezaqr/dd_how_to_identifying_the_next_50_drop_stocks/", "is_self": true}
