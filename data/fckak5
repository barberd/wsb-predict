I tried to sell immediately after the initial pop but nothing was working. I watched the huge dip and tried to get out multiple times. I finally got a trade through at around 10am with a limit of $2.21. After the surge started I tried to cancel a bunch of times but obviously that would not work. At the close my average price was $6.75, +150% a little over $4k, and then 20 minutes ago I get an email saying my order was executed at 12:38pm for my limit price of $2.21. At 12:38, the SPY was at around $303 and could've been sold for a hell of a better price, instead they sell it for a $500 loss, this has to be straight up illegal.", "created_utc": 1583188139, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fckak5/rh_executed_my_order_for_a_loss_they_are_stealing/", "is_self": true}
