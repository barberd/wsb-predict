IF you were lucky enough to snatch the june calls for cheap you already know this.\n\nthe REAL hard facts are this, wells fargo is trash bank, has garbage reputation, and is one of if not the weakest of the bank plays.

HOWEVER this is a long term play not a quick week or month play.\n\nas long as the share price is under $33 it's a call once it hits the 33 level i recommend puts but if it breaks 35 hold your balls.\n\ni really don't know anything about financials i just followed by gut feeling on this, im just some unemployed dude with no background in finance.\n\nbut look at all this positive AND negative attention wells fargo is getting\n\n[https://newsdaemon.com/2020/06/15/wells-fargo-company-wfc-return-on-assets-touches-1-03-these-shares-are-poised-for-major-movement/](https://newsdaemon.com/2020/06/15/wells-fargo-company-wfc-return-on-assets-touches-1-03-these-shares-are-poised-for-major-movement/)\n\n[https://dwinnex.com/2020/06/15/wells-fargo-company-wfc-resumes-bullish-trend-whats-in-it-for-long-term-investors/](https://dwinnex.com/2020/06/15/wells-fargo-company-wfc-resumes-bullish-trend-whats-in-it-for-long-term-investors/)\n\n\"SOME SEEKING ARTICLE ABOUT WELLS FARGO VOLATILE TIMES, JUST GOOGLE IT\"\n\n[https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/12/wells-fargo-cfo-predicts-higher-loan-loss-provisio.aspx](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/12/wells-fargo-cfo-predicts-higher-loan-loss-provisio.aspx)\n\n[https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/11/heres-why-wells-fargo-jpmorgan-chase-and-other-big.aspx](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/11/heres-why-wells-fargo-jpmorgan-chase-and-other-big.aspx)\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/06/05/why-wells-fargos-stock-looks-attractive-at-30/#1b825fc64e90](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/06/05/why-wells-fargos-stock-looks-attractive-at-30/#1b825fc64e90)\n\nif you are retarded like me and can't read, basically everyone is saying the same thing except they throw around some numbers to give themselves credibility. today was a huge opportunity for a buy but if you didnt buy today don't worry it's still cheaper than it was last week. with room for improvement.\n\nlastly one more thing to keep in mind is the earnings date. it can either go not so bad, to very fucking good if they exceed their piss poor expectations. but honestly their expectations are so low they will most likely beat them. who knows tho.\n\ngood luck fellow retards may the tendies be with you.\n\nif not we will be on the bread lines together ;)\n\nJAN 15 50C, JUNE 18 40C, JUNE 18 50C\n\nlol AUG 21 SPY 390C, AUG 21 395C", "created_utc": 1592257005.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h9pghf/wells_fucking_fargo_pt2/", "is_self": true}
