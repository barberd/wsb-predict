{"id": "cmhwgh", "title": "MSFT $150 CALL/ 17JAN20", "selftext": "Alright let me start out by saying I probably just have a textbook case of the auts, but for what it's worth here's some of my DD for MSFT 6 month calls that I will be purchasing sometime this week.   \n\n\nIf we assume the trade wars decline for the market will last as long as the they did during late May/Early June, then the bottom of the dip will be sometime this week. Last time MSFT rallied more than 20 dollars from 119 to 140 from a time span of approximately 2 months. If the trend continues, I'll be up roughly 200%. If it doesn't, it still seems attainable that MFST summits 152.68 by mid January.
