Advisory committee already voted in favor of supporting approval.\n\nBPMC - GI Tumors - PDUFA stage - Under priority review that was extended for February 14th, 2020.\n\nAGRX - Contraceptive Patch - PDUFA Stage - Was extended to February 16th, 2020. This is a big stock for me, I believe it has room to drop a little bit more before buying in. It has a huge BioTech conference coming in middle of January that will really spark interest in it before the potential approval Feb. 16th. The advisory committee voted in favor of approving 14 to 1. Big ratio in approval I think it has a good chance of getting passed.\n\nHZNP - Thyroid Eye Disease - PDUFA stage - Priority review is set for March 8th 2020. Advisory committee voting unanimously 12 to 0 in support for approval. I think it could potentially drop a little more as well before jumping in. This unanimous vote shows that the benefits far outweight any of the potential risks of the treatment. Could be a big multibagger.\n\nAZM - Small cell lung cancer - PDUFA stage - Under priority review, though no date is announced yet, it's estimated that the date is March 29th, 2020.\n\nLLY - Tanezuab - NDA Filing Stage. Second trial was released January 29th, 2019. Data from trial on April 18th, 2019 met 2/3 endpoints in 5mg arm, but failed to meet endpoints in 2.5mg arm. Regulatory filing due EOY 2019/Early 2020.\n\nWould love to hear your feedback on these biotech companies. I think AGRX and HZNP could be some lowkey big hitters.", "created_utc": 1577474515, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/egfifm/biotech_plays_for_first_quarter_2020/", "is_self": true}
