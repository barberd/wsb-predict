Market is anticipating Trump re-election. If Warren wins both the primary and election, market will tank. She wants to break up Amazon- Amazon will tank 50% if she is elected. Medicare for all? Healthcare stocks will tank. SPY will tank. A few months before Election Day, throw all your money into Amazon puts- and then Election Day comes, and now you have a yacht.
