{"id": "f76e7d", "title": "$BRK.B Earnings Options Play (1,000% return last time I did this)", "selftext": "Alright here's the deal,\n\n**Berkshire Hathaway ($BRK.B)** is about to drop their Q4 Earnings this weekend. Over the past year Berkshire has lagged the SP500 and no one has been really giving it much attention. **This earnings report is about to be one of the top 5 largest quarterly gains of all time**. **Their investment portfolio ALONE has gained around $35B since last quarter.** Think about how well AAPL has been doing, then remember that Berkshire's largest position is AAPL. Their AAPL position alone has gained nearly $20B dollars. No one is really looking at Berkshire while everyone is losing their shit over SPCE TSLA AMD, all while **Berkshire is sitting here with over $130B in cash** and a great portfolio\n\nBack in Q3 November 2018 The situation looked similar and their P/B ratio was very low (although lower than it is now). **The company issued buybacks and my calls went up over 1,000%**. Class B shares should be trading at $250, I strongly believe that Berkshire Hathaway remains undervalued and that the market has just been ignoring Berkshire Hathaway\n\nCalls are also cheap AF. \n\nHere is the play:\n\n**3/6 $230 and 3/6 $235 Calls** \n\nThey're currently at $1.85 and $0.44 each\n\nAlternatively you could look at 2/28 $230\n\nCurrently have 5 of each of the contracts along with 40 shares but I plan to buy another $2k in calls tomorrow at market open.", "created_utc": 1582262334, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f76e7d/brkb_earnings_options_play_1000_return_last_time/", "is_self": true}
