I expect a continuation tomorrow. \n\n- Dropped a bit AH because of an offering and low liquidity, however underwriter of the offering, JP MORGAN gave them a $120 PT on Wednesday. It\u2019s currently at $97. \n\n- Republican bill contains body camera orders, and it seems like Trump is finally playing the game. Excited to see what he says tomorrow. \n\nThey are about to reap some heavy profits. I\u2019m in at 6/19 100c and 6/19 105c. July is also safe.", "created_utc": 1592258334.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h9pum4/aaxn_republican_police_order_bull_wednesday_trump/", "is_self": true}
