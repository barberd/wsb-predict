For instance, in 1955, the DJIA was at around 4500, same in 1973, but most people agree that the period in between was 'great'.\n\nThis means that- ok. The real investors are gone, let's talk about the real shit : ***ROLLER COASTERS***. Hear me out ok? This thing is unreal. An absolutely unparalleled sensory experience. From the time you crest the first hill till the train enters the station again it's absolutely relentless, non-stop madness. It twists and turns you on completely unexpected ways. The strangest part of the experience is that no matter how many people describe it to you, you simply won't be prepared for it. The trains don't have any kind of head or shoulder restraints like pretty much any other ride that inverts like this would. Everything is open from the waist up, which really adds to the experience a lot. They achieve this through the use of leg restraints which are built into the lap bar mechanism allowing for ***TOTAL SAFETY***. This allow for an utterly relentless thrill of a ride, so great that it's hard to describe the sensation. And when you're done this experience will mark you forever.\n\nSo now why does my point still stands? Well, roller coasters are great, i think we can all agree on that. And Trumpouille is preparing us for the wildest ride of roller coaster ever, and it's starting soon, so you HAVE TO GET ON IT. This will be the trill of a lifetime, endless foreplay through sharp downs followed by long and suspenseful ups, unable to see what's coming because of the way it has been engineered. If you stay out of it, you'll never be able to experience anything like it ever again, so you'll miss the 'MURICAN greatness, and that is bad. Not great. At all. \n\nSo the only question left is: why would you miss it? Only someone boring would miss out on this, and boring isn't great. So be great, be 'MURICAN and join Trumpette's WILDEST GREAT RIDE into the dark before the train departs the station.", "created_utc": 1580488209, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ewqwi2/why_the_current_market_ups_and_down_show_that/", "is_self": true}
