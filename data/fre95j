Protective and source control masks, as well as other protective equipment, should have the ability to repeatedly withstand the kind of high-momentum multiphase turbulent gas cloud that may be ejected during a sneeze or a cough and the exposure from them. Currently used surgical and N95 masks are not tested for these potential characteristics of respiratory emissions.\n\nResearch is showing that social distancing at 6 feet is likely to be ineffective and should be 27 feet, thus making most efforts and current mask efforts a questionable means of control. \n\nUnsure what to make of this in the long term implications.", "created_utc": 1585519277.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fre95j/new_research_from_mit_study_in_the_journal_of_the/", "is_self": true}
