Beat earnings last quarter by over 400%, recently sold some of their underperforming overseas assets to better allocate capital, and analysts 12 mos. price targets are between $15 and $26. Still down over 21% over the last 3 months. Their Bakken wells absolutely rip at peak production and they aren\u2019t showing any signs of slowing on new completions. I\u2019m about to yolo all of my life savings into some August calls for this. Can someone smarter than me please convince me I\u2019m retarded?", "created_utc": 1562961663, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ccfucw/mro_yolo/", "is_self": true}
