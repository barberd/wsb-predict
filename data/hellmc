{"id": "hellmc", "title": "VJET Round 2?", "selftext": "About four years ago there were a few posts about a stock called VJET. It's a 3d Printing company that is valued at $1.53 as I type this. As per an agreement made in 2017, VJET will be receiving  **\u20ac**5 million. This is going to allow them to begin series production. They have contracts with BMW, Porsche, Nike and Ford, just to name a few. Once production ramps up, so will their stock price. Does anybody know why VJET wouldn't be a good long term hold or even a short term buy. Also, are there any recent advancements in the 3d printing field that make another company a better choice. NNDM is about to go through a 1:50 reverse split, so probably not them. What else is happening in that industry?", "created_utc": 1592941742.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hellmc/vjet_round_2/", "is_self": true}
