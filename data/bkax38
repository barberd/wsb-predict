It looks like it prob won't reach my strike of 63.10, but if it does doe,s Robinhood automatically exercises it?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI bought 3 contracts at .08 a piece, and Robinhood is saying I can only exercise myself if i have the $ to cover the shares. So i have to have enough $ to cover 300 shares of $LYFT if i want to exercise it myself? And I don't have that $ so then what?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know i'm a retard but these could actually pay a few hundred for me for a $24 investment", "created_utc": 1556903594, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bkax38/newb_options_question_about_exercising_a_call/", "is_self": true}
