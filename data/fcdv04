{"id": "fcdv04", "title": "DD: Senior Living REITS", "selftext": "One thing that I\u2019m drifting towards is picking \u201cpurer\u201d plays for the virus. At first I thought AAPL was obvious, due to their China exposure, but there are a lot of ways it can go sideways\u2026same with semiconductors, etc. I\u2019m sticking to my DAL puts right now, because that is pretty pure\u2014I think peoples behavior will really affect air travel for the next year. In light of the nursing home fatalities in Washington State, I decided to look at specific industries that the virus will affect long term: industries with exposure to old people. Its pretty dark, I know, but you gotta find value where its not being efficiently measured. If things continue like they are, senior living facilities are going to be hit hard. These are the people that are \u201cground zero\u201d for the virus. Right now is supposedly only kills 15% of the 80+ demographic and 8% of the 70 +, you also need to factor in the risk of what happens when the medical system is overwhelmed. Additionally, you need to factor in the optics of it\u2026boomers are really motivated by fear, moreso than other generations. You have a natural animosity towards \u201cgoing into a home\u201d and now, when these homes are going to see REALLY high mortality rates, I think it will hurt the long term outlook for them. Imagine a senior assisted living / nursing home REIT that suddenly loses 15% of its tenants, possibly more, another few % flee their lease to get out and stay with family, while simultaneously decreasing the \u201cnext generation\u201d of tenants through some mortality but also the optics of these areas being \u201cground zero\u201d. I looked around at REITS for this and settled on Welltower $WELL. Its not a nursing home play, but rather, 55% of its income is derived from private payers (people with money\u2014see people with options to leave if they want). These REITS already have slightly higher vacancy rates than others, and if you see a 15-20% decrease in tenants over the next year, it\u2019ll hit them hard. This also gives you a play on real estate as a whole which, if anything is guaranteed, a Chinese housing crunch will lead to similar housing crunch here, which is likely in the next year. Sure, fed rate cuts will help REITS, but look at how Japan\u2019s 90s crunch affected our housing market. $WELL's facilities are largely in urban centers like NYC. If the virus does what its doing in other areas, these facilities will be hit harder due to their demographic and geographic location. \n\nSome alternative plays here are $OHI and $PEAK, but I avoided each of these for various reasons. OHI is nursing homes and people that are in there don't generally have financial flexibility to leave (OHI derives its income from medicare). $PEAK is less of a pure play. \n\nTL/DR: Shorting senior living REITS (non gov-reliant) due to the virus\u2019 targeting these areas, and then playing on the resulting disinclination for people to live in these facilities. I picked up some $WELL puts today, may buy some more soon.", "created_utc": 1583163684, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fcdv04/dd_senior_living_reits/", "is_self": true}
