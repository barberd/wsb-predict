{"id": "g6qupc", "title": "How I bled half our our savings, only to YOLO my last $4k on GILD FD's and make it back", "selftext": "So, I've followed this community for a long time. I mainly traded futures, but I had an interest in options. My first year trading futures after paper trading for about 3 weeks (I belong here), I lost $9,000.\n\nI broke that to my wife about 9 months after it happened. We both make great money, so she didn't even notice. I got off easy.\n\nAnyway, as the market began to crash, I saw the news and put in some short trades on mini-Russel futures. I made something to the tune of $10,000 back, and I told my wife. I poured more money into the accounts, and I had somewhere around $16k in there.\n\nI then shorted at 2540 and watched my account get railed as the market rallied. I was down to my last $4k, and I couldn't tell my wife that I not only lost all the money I made back from last year, but I lost even MORE on top of that.\n\nThen, GILD happened.\n\n[I wrote DD that GILD was certainly going to tank within the week as the hype for their drug was horseshit, and the drug company was even downplaying the results which I had never seen before.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2x65h/everything_you_need_to_know_about_why_gild_puts/)\n\nI purchased my first options ever:\n\n#$4,000 in $74p GILD on 04/17\n\n[So, if you check my post history, you'll see I closed this position out for a modest profit,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5yjae/daily_discussion_thread_for_april_22_2020/fo6evwf/) I think like $200. The stock kept going down, but IV+Theta ate away at my puts. I hadn't traded options, so I got scared and bailed out thinking they may expire worthless.\n\nBut, the itch was still there. I couldn't go back to my wife some cuck who lost $12,000. I was tired of managing this shit, so it's all or nothing.\n\nYesterday I yolo'd my entire account:\n#95 Contracts of 04/24 $75p\n\nAs 10am this morning, My $16,000 account was worth $600. I was depressed on the couch, thinking what we could have done with $16,000, how I would just let my position expire worthless, and my last bit of joy posting my final post on this sub showing $19 in my account.\n\nBut then, just as I predicted in my DD, news broke today that GILD's drug was, in fact, not turning out to be the miracle people expected.\n\nAs I lay flaccid on my couch, bemoaning defeat, my phone alarms go crazy. GILD below 80, GILD below 79, GILD below 78, I couldn't keep up with the messages as the stock went into freefall, and I start seeing \"Order filled,\" and I begin losing my mind because my orders were placed so high.\n\n\n#The stock fell from +2.5% to -6%\n\nI bough my Puts at ~0.45, and sold for >$2. If you bought this morning, you could have had a 20x return.\n\nI made all the money I lost back, and more. Now to transfer most of that back to cash and push the reset button.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/rtpfmVo", "created_utc": 1587662802.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6qupc/how_i_bled_half_our_our_savings_only_to_yolo_my/", "is_self": true}
