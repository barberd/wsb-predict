These picks aren't coming from notes, but straight from my head as I type them out this week trying to give myself something to watch closely.\n\nThere's always the chance that the market dips and rebounds and we just resume on Monday. I honestly give it a coinflip chance of a MASSIVE down day followed by a slightly down day Tuesday, and a MASSIVE down opening, followed by ridiculous dip buying.\n\n**On another note:** There's some people that run around here claiming I'm taking advantage of people (frontrunning, selling premium to you guys, etc, which is laughable since I don't list strikes and barely list the same stock two weeks in a row) or that I shouldn't post this DD because you guys will blindly go 'lose money' on it or whatever. **Let's get fucking real, you do that just fine on your own.**\n\nMoreover -- the amount of you that have sent me messages about your gains/increasing success/increasing knowledge is encouraging, I do appreciate those PM's. I'm not here for the feels necessarily, but if you do something good for once, learn something, or have a real question to better your trading, feel free to private message me and let me know. Picked up something good? I enjoy knowing that you are making progress from being a complete degenerate to like, a half degen.\n\n# How I Pick Plays For Myself\n\nThese plays are found using my own scanner criteria across a variety of metrics depending on market conditions we are in (upturn, back/fill, pullback, sideways consolidation, etc). Picks are generated from that scan. Those scans are ran through scripts that check certain volatility skews and other metrics based on volume and volatility ratios. These are my own scripts, and nah, you can't have them. The indicative theory here is sell IV when it's high and buy IV when it's low (for the most part) follow trends and follow the big money (I rarely list my credit spread plays, because I don't want someone to blow their retirement out of the water based on my advice). Volatility is literally the most important aspect in options pricing and finding positive EV situations. A few of the criteria for the ToS scans are:\n\n* Market cap of $5B+\n* Daily volume of 1M+\n* Volume, volume differential, RSI, 52 week low's and high's, ToS sizzle, and a few others decide what comes out of the scan, then selected as a pick based on script results/current market conditions/sentiment.\n\n# My Project Update\n\nIf you want to stay up to date on the things I'm working on outside of here, follow me on my Reddit profile and feel free to message me. I'm doing multiple things, including making a blog to post expanded commentary on certain market events, and some free training content on nuance type things (analyzing stocks, backtesting, etc). I'm about 80% of the way completed with it, and hope it'll be a good place to talk real shop and not gambling habits.  I have a couple other things in the pipeline, so if you want to know more about them, as I said you can follow me on here.\n\n# Results On Last Week's Picks\n\nIf you blindly bought in on Monday, most the picks were extremely profitable come Wednesday, I think all but one. However, JPow released his infinity gauntlet ([https://imgur.com/RY2XdtS](https://imgur.com/RY2XdtS)), and we all took the dick Wednesday and Thursday, I'm sure. Well, all of us except those that had cheap credit spreads to buy back and close.\n\nWednesday and Thursday can be discredited for almost all last week's daily price action because the entire broad market was down, regardless what you were playing. Friday was an awesome recovery and shows that we aren't just in a massive bubble, depending what happens Monday with Trump's fiasco today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Microsoft (MSFT) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Opened week: $129.93, Closed: $128.89, High: $131.23\n\n* \"Consolidation commencing\" - I ended up cashing out my calls mid week. I lost my heart to hold my $135s mid week on Wednesday, and cashed them out at super solid 175% or so. I've had them since like a week before earnings, so it was about time to move on. We saw a lot of back/fill action and consolidation until JPow unleashed the bears, however it had a pretty massive day on Friday. There were definitely points to get in on this mid week last week and if you bought the dip, you could have had a good week on it and might have a good one this week, even with the Trump shit coming to light tonight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Oracle (ORCL) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Opened week: $55.29, Closed: $54.78, High: $55.50\n\n* \"For me, Oracle is kind of a proxy play and a momentum play.\" - And it still is. I think we're seeing a lot of consolidation here still and people are pretty likely to buy any impending dip on it with Monday's market. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Nvidia (NVDA) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Opened week: $178.39, Closed: $183.00, High: $184.87\n\n* \"BUYYYY THEEEE DIPPPPP.\" - Not much to say here. It traded strong all week on the prior week's semi sector weakness and I think it did so appropriately. Earnings are coming up, so you may see quite a bit of people buying this stock up pre-earnings on the thesis that AMD beat earnings, so it's likely Nvidia will also (not to mention, EVERY COMPANY IS BEATING this earnings seasons because of the sandbagged guidance previously).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Disney (DIS) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Opened week: $142.19 (after hours rise), Closed: $134.28, High: $143.05 (pre-market monday)\n\n* \"It's Mickey, mother fuckers.\" - Yknow... this one pissed me off a bit. I had a chance to get out of my very profitable calls Monday after the initial dip, and did not do that. I sold Tuesday a bit after open and just decided to watch. That being said, we're back around where we were after the Disney+ announcement, and if it goes any lower, I'm very tempted to buy back into calls or even sell puts against earnings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Electronic Arts (EA) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Opened week: $94.89, Closed: $92.50 High: $97.20\n\n* \"Buy the dip?\" - So there's a lot to be said here. It's a perfect example of a good trader wins and a greedy one eats the dick. There was definitely a point on Monday AND Tuesday to enter, and a clear point on Wednesday to exit if your greed didn't get to you. You got another chance on Thursday morning, even. The way I look at this company has not changed whatsoever: They have been so heavily beat down for the last few quarters, and lost such a huge amount of their stock's value that the upside is much more likely than the downside. It's kind of like a game of limbo right now, but I'm not sure they can clear under another bar. We saw clear buying action off the $90ish lows before last week, and plenty of buying action even on Wednesday. The way I look at it is that most the bad news is priced into this stock, and none of the good news. Company valuation is improving, fundamentals in general, are improving, so they'd have to have a god awful earnings report to do any worse than they already are, and I just don't see that happening. They still hold some of the most popular sports franchises, which cannot be discredited, either. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Square (SQ) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Opened week: $71.54, Closed: $68.52 High: $74.73\n\n* \"I **LOVE** Square\" - And nothing has changed, either. As far as the trade, if you held through earnings, that's the risk we take, right? There was obvious places to profit here. Their payments processed number was disappointing in the quarterly report, but I think with this stock we're playing the long game. The earnings report made it all seem a lot worse than it was, and they bottomed out at $66 at one point last week. This is similar to what happened to $TEAM a few weeks ago, and Atlassian is almost back where they were pre-earnings. Same thing is likely happening here as far as a mean reversion goes. I think the company is strong, they fill an important and needed niche, but Dorsey needs to focus a lot more on expanded market penetration than his bullshit Cash App. Long term, the app has potential to get them into the peer to peer space a bit more, but I think his initial vision was probably as people using it like Apple Pay, and that, I just don't see happening. All of that being said, they don't have any real threat in the space (PayPal's card reader experiment was anything but successful) and they hold a special spot, doing a special thing for small and medium sized businesses (even some larger ones). They will likely focus on expanding service revenues, and I still am bullish on Square. It's a good spot to average down/buy in because in my opinion it's going back over $70 in short time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Alaska Air (ALK) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Opened week: $60.30, Closed: $62.47, High: $63.26\n\n* \"I always fly Alaska\" - And still will. The stock showed some great strength throughout all of the mid week bullshit, was mostly unaffected, and if you bought any time Monday, you're green and probably staying green, I went to almost all cash on Friday afternoon in my options account so -- this is one of the last ones I have, will likely liquidate Monday morning at some point, but may go back in if they clear/hold over $63. Not much else to analyze here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Exxon Mobil (XOM) -** ***BEARISH*** \\- Opened week: $80.12, Closed: $77.47, Low: $77.24\n\n* \"Exxon has shown some decided weakness\" - Now, the entire oil sector kind of pulled back a bit, but we're in a backing/filling period with it and I expect the sector to rebound sometime soon. It may not be this week but it's hard for me to stay bearish much below $75 or so in the short term. Played out as expected.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Occidental (OXY) -** ***BEARISH*** \\- Opened week: $60.00, Closed: $57.95, Low: $56.95\n\n* \"Bidding war with Chevron now over Anadarko\" - The Buffett news helped them out a bit, and Icahn building a position is interesting also. That being said, I'm probably ready to be out of this. My main thesis was in general, they had introduced a level of uncertainty that was too much on the speculative news over the deal and that they would likely retract since the deal is anything but done, and they did. Now -- if they don't get the deal with Anadarko -- we could see it really pull back further, as stockholder sentiment will likely fall hard if they can't get a deal done with Buffett literally throwing cash at them. I'm also leaning bullish on the oil sector after last week, so it's hard to stay bearish here for consistencies sake.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Spotify (SPOT) -** ***BEARISH*** \\- Opened week: $144.40, Closed: $136.16, Low: $131.86\n\n* \"The stock isn't cheap or competitively priced\" - Buying action reinforced that thought (or selling action, in this case). Even if you weren't in before earnings, there was a chance to get in on puts and make a good profit by Thursday's dip. That first candle on Monday morning should have been enough indication that it was going lower, too. \n\n# State of the Market\n\nBull and bear in a China shop right now - literally. It's just a lot to take in from a lot of angles. \n\nThe dip off the Fed announcing they weren't doing anything was disappointing (obviously a cut was priced in at that point, solely based off price action, so no question about that now) but now we look for other catalysts to continue higher. The China trade deal is a big one but it seems that Trump is completely off his rocker and going full Elon on Twitter. The way I look at it is that a pullback is more imminent (could be one or two days, or could be a full week, or we can go full December, who knows) but the stabilization on Thursday and the buying action on Friday is a really good sign. It means that at least enough investors didn't really care about what the Fed said and decided at the prices equities are at, it was still worth buying things back up. If the market really disintegrates this week on Monday because of what Trump has said, I'm likely not trading a whole lot until the market shows its colors on Wednesday.\n\nWhat I'm trying to get at is that you need to be fluid with your strategies. \n\nSome of the ones I had written down for this week like Google calls, Nvidia calls, selling put spreads on Amazon, selling put spreads on Apple, are all probably up in smoke over one tweet on a Sunday. My Alibaba catch up trade is also probably up in fucking smoke after what he said as I was about to buy FD calls on it.\n\nI have them in my playbook still, but I may just hold onto them until an opportunity presents itself at some point whether it's this week or not. Now that earnings are behind us for a lot of companies, you can draw a thesis on a company based on their guidance and post earnings performance. Now is the time to be playing longer dated calls in single leg strategies, and now is the time to be formulating what shares you want to own in a wider portfolio because you know what sectors are poised to outperform, and what headwinds face other sectors. \n\nSo we're shifting gears to include two sector based strategies this week, as an example of how to be fluid. Let's be clear... until the market shows some type of bottom or stabilization Monday(Tues/Wed)? on decent volume: I'm sitting out. You do what you want.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Picks for Week of May 6th, 2019\n\n**All of the commentary on specific tickers are simply notes I wrote to myself.** Each ticker listed is not a suggestion to buy or sell, but simply the ones I took notes on that I'm considering entering. These notes are not to you personally. These are not complete transcriptions -- simply summaries of my thoughts. Do your own DD.  I may or may not enter trades on these or may already be in them. The bottom of the post has the options I'm long on, as a secondary holding disclaimer.\n\nBecause I get shit for going with market trends, I'm going to try to pick things tat\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Nvidia (NVDA) - $183.01** ***- BULLISH***\n\nThey report on 5/16. So... after AMD's actually very solid earnings report, and them subsequently not holding their gains, I posted in the daily discussion that I was about to go balls deep in AMD calls. Well, I did. I bought a fuckton of cheap lottos at $28.50 strike and they all... expired worthless because I fell asleep mid morning Thursday and held too long. Too bad, so sad. That being said -- I think AMD's successful earnings report creates an opportunity to get bullish on Nvidia again.\n\nI think Nvidia is in general, a better company than AMD, and AMD has to compete with both Intel and Nvidia, while Nvidia is only competing with one. Intel's shitty quarter may speak a lot to why AMD's was so good, but I think that overall, the huge uptick in Fortnite, Apex, etc. means graphic card sales probably closed some of the gap down from when the crypto bubble burst.\n\nThey are **VERY EXPOSED** to the China trade talks however. If the sector shows some real weakness, I plan to wait until it's done and find a GOOD ENTRY POINT HERE. I think the stock at some point is heading back north of $210, so it's all about being a magician with your entry point and being patient.\n\n* **Plays I'm Looking At -** June/July north of 200 calls, or if shorter dated, ATM once the market stabilizes this week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Amazon (AMZN) - $1,962.46** ***- BULLISH***\n\nBecause it's an easy pick and it's Amazon... right? BERKSHIRE DID IT WHY CAN'T I?! That being said... yeah there's a ton of momentum behind this move. Once again, the market is probably going to be shit on Monday morning, so there's a chance to play a catch up here after missing the move on Friday.\n\n* **Plays I'm Looking At -** I saw a lot of cool gains on Friday morning on that pop -- but we likely are not getting a 3% day in this again overnight. I'm looking at slightly OTM calls, short expiration, mid May, trying to find a dip to buy on and wait for a rise on solid volume. I'm also going to try to replicate what some people did in the thread, and buy FD's on Thursday (because I cannot help myself) before close if the stock is down at all and Trump hasn't burned the entire market to the ground.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Financials ETF (XLF) - $28.06** ***- BULLISH*** \n\nThe banks have shown all kinds of strength in the last few months if you check the trend on this ETF. They've held above the $27 point which is really important, and I think we can see that continue for longer if the markets don't deteriorate into a complete pullback.\n\n* **Plays I'm Looking At -** May 17 calls, Jun 21 lottos. Likely playing the May's for the swing and not looking to take them too far into profit, and let the June's ride if the May's work out. If the May's do not work out, I will adjust my strikes for the Junes, average down if I can, and go back in on Junes, and watch/adjust as needed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Alaska Air (ALK) - $62.48 -** ***BULLISH***\n\nLike I said in my recap, this stock showed immense strength through the rest of the market selling off. It's also on a good uptrend, has broken the $62 range which was really important point of resistance, and could be on it's way back to $70+. I like it still this week.\n\n* **Plays I'm Looking At -** Only monthlies here, so front month ATM/1 strike inside, longer dated 3% OTM.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Alibaba (BABA) - $195.21** ***- BEARISH***\n\nThis could be the pick that makes me look pretty fucking stupid, but I just cannot see how they can hold the last week or two worth of gains with how the trade talks are going. They're super exposed and some of these gains had to be the pricing in of a successful trade deal. Once the trade talk bullshit stabilizes (if it does) it's likely just going north again, so this has to be a short term play.\n\n* **Plays I'm Looking At -** Front week ATM puts, monthlies somewhere between $190 and $185. Considering selling call spreads near the money on short term expirations, or even one or two strikes inside as the risk rewards pretty good if we can get a fat dip. I'll just eat max loss and pay to close them out if they don't work out rather than end up short shares.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**USA Oil ETF (USO) - $12.86** ***-*** ***BULLISH***\n\nSo the oil sector, as a WHOLE has shown a bit of strength over the last few months. While we're in the midst of a pullback, I think this is one to be watched. I may/probably won't trade it this week, but if we can see some positive action in the price of oil this week -- it's worth jumping on board. There's a decidedly obvious pullback at the EXACT moment in it all, but I think after a really good run this year without any hesitation, it was coming.\n\n* **Plays I'm Looking At -** FD's if they're still cheap Monday at $13, or $13.50 lottos at $2 a pop. June/July around the same strike, and $14's seem appealing even in June. Will be waiting on ALL these plays if the sector shows weakness Monday morning/afternoon, and pending any real news in the oil sector. If the pullback continues, just waiting and adjusting strikes appropriately until I feel comfortable entering and know I will average down if I'm wrong on timing it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What Strike(s) Are You Looking At?\n\nI used to list these in detail, but I don't put as much detail into these now for multiple reasons. I've tried to slowly add more detail to help people see how I think about the trade in general, but YMMV. You should pick your own strikes, because I could very well be wrong. \n\nThe majority of the time, if I'm playing anything near week or near month, it's going to be ATM or VERY slightly OTM. Sometimes I get the FD itch, like everybody else. I will regularly throw $100 or some shit at some SPY/QQQ lottos during strength or in volatile environments. In more stable environments, I'm less likely to do this. \n\nIf I'm holding two or three months out I'm likely buying further OTM as I feel more comfortable accepting a 100% capital risk as the capital invested is normally lower and I'm much more speculative but have more upside. I'm also willing to average down on these positions heavily on down days. \n\nIf I'm selling credit spreads or cash secured puts, it all depends. If I'm truly heavily bearish, I'm selling at the money shit and watching it depreciate quickly on a near week expiry. If I'm just sure it's in a consolidation period, I'm a bit OTM. If I'm really feeling like gambling, I might even sell ITM credit spreads on either side (calls if I'm bearish, puts if I'm bullish) and try to capture both Vega and intrinsic. \n\nIf it's earnings, it all depends on my outlook on the company, it's current price levels/volume, and other economic/market factors, as well as sector influences. I can be very bullish short term but bearish past this month based on uncertainty, because uncertainty rules all.\n\n# Can I Just Blindly Follow You And Win?\n\nNope, that's why it's called trading. In fact, you probably can't trade on the long side for more than 20% or so of your total plays and win in the long term (2-5 years). Six months, or one year, or whatever is not the type of trading volume to even form a real decision on a trend. Even a few thousand trades isn't really enough, and you may be working in a certain market environment where a strategy works, until it does not anymore.\n\nI cannot teach you how to trade. Only how to pick things to trade. The trading is the hard part - we're not investing -- we're trading. Essentially it's high level gambling: Knowing when to hold 'em and knowing when to fold 'em is what this game is about.\n\n**Just because a stock is listed here doesn't mean you blindly just enter a fucking trade on it.** Look for the entry, look for the catalysts, market news, sector strength/weakness, uncertainties, take advantage of sector moves up or other binary events, take advantage of pullbacks or consolidation to look for a price.\n\n**The trend is your friend.**\n\nEntries, exits, risk allowance on your portfolio, diversification of strategies, adjusting trades, legging in and out of positions, and many other tactics will decide your success. Starting with long calls or puts, or more desirably debit spreads (to limit capital exposure), are a good way to get a feel for how prices fluctuate. That will allow you to deduce more complicated strategies and decide what type of options trader you want to be. **There's multiple ways to profit off the same exact underlying,** at some points there will be longs AND shorts that profit at the end of the week.\n\n**READ THIS:** The majority of people who win in the market are net sellers. That doesn't mean that there's never a situation where a single leg call or put is a good/okay idea. Somewhere between 50-90% of my activities with options at any given time is spent SELLING PREMIUM. I will **never** list a stock as Bullish that I have credit spreads open on or that I'm selling premium on. \n\nNo more than 15% of my entire portfolio is in options at any time which is still incredibly high for the average person, but with the technological advantage and automation at my fingertips, I'm okay with having that level of risk. I also used to play poker semi-professionally, so I'm not risk averse, in any way shape or form.\n\nTake this for what it is.\n\n# About Correlated/Corresponding Picks\n\nCorrelated picks are important. An example is playing Apple/Facebook/Microsoft and SPY. If any of those gain, it's more likely SPY gains that week since it's weighted towards them and the sector is likely doing well, and the S&amp;P is weighted towards them. Calls in both double dips, but can see your money evaporate also. Buying tech sector puts and SPY calls makes no sense, for the exact same rationale unless it's a pure hedge against share value, or an isolated catalyst like a lawsuit or acquisition, in which case, it's probably going to pull the ETF/index down or up with it anyway. The best way to double dip is to find complimentary positions.\n\n# Should I Hold Or Sell?\n\nFigure it out on your own. I can't tell you what's right for you nor do I care to. You have to learn to trade on your own, if this DD doesn't get you moving forward enough and you can't draw up a plan on how to trade it, then that's your problem and trading that stock or trading in general ***may not be for you.*** **To get better at this, play in markets you know well.** Play in stocks that move and behave somewhat rationally with sector news and are CURRENTLY in a correlated state (market goes up, stock goes up, and vice versa), and plan where you're entering and where you're exiting.\n\n# Will You Cover This Ticker/Give Me Your Thoughts On This?\n\n**Post coverage requests in this post. Not to my private messages.**\n\n**BEFORE YOU ASK FOR A TICKER:** Lots of people ask for the same thing, I don't mind adding color commentary on specifics if you have a question about a certain aspect of the company, but please just load all the comments and CTRL+F (CMD+F for Mac) and look for that ticker to see if there's a conversation going on about it already.\n\nIf you've got something you are eyeing, I'll occasionally be willing to offer my thoughts on the company and the underlying. **I can not, and will not tell you when to enter/exit/buy/sell any stock or option,** however. I will simply say what I think about the specific ticker and their outlook. Once again, it is simply **my opinion and not advice.** **If you ask for a ticker overview, include the ticker symbol with a $, like $AAPL,** so I can just search the thread for them. If you ask me specifically for advice on your own position, or situation, I'll simply ignore your comment.\n\n# Private Messages/Chat Requests\n\nI may or may not respond. Depends if the question is worth answering or if you just glazed over the post. I won't answer private messages about specific stocks. **Post coverage requests in this post.** Strategy based things, more likely.\n\n# Holdings Disclaimer\n\nOn listed plays: I am long Alaska Air options.
