This is in comparison to both statements by the companies and to predictions from many buy-side analysts, namely ARK Invest and Baron Funds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***-----------------------------***\n\n**tl;dr:**\n\n2030 predictions including AMaas: &gt;!$19860 share price from $694B revenue, $280B profit, $4.6T market cap!&lt;\n\n2030 predictions excluding AMaas: &gt;!$6628 share price from $508B revenue, $213B profit, $2T market cap!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**major notes:**\n\npredicted 1.2m vehicle sales 2024 is 40% of Musk's stated expectation of 3m\n\ncurrent EV market share of approx. 18% drops to \\~4% 2024\n\nAMaaS release 5yrs behind Musk's original timeline\n\npredicted auto production growth is \\~35% yoy, Musk has stated that he expects 50% yoy\n\n% AMaaS vehicles on network could be 2-8x and hrs/week could be 2-3x realistically once safety has been proven\n\ncomparing EV/EBIT and P/S ratios to similar growth companies and the total market in general (Feb20) portrays the predicted 2030 valuations as extremely conservative and could realistically be 1.5-3x\n\n^(\\^these notes and many others are further explained within the Notes section of the spreadsheet)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***-----------------------------***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*i of course must also say that i have no idea what i'm talking about + that you should take everything in these spreadsheets with a mouthful of salt water, making no investment decisions based on me nor my numbers.*", "created_utc": 1582387227, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7udla/my_tsla_valuation_model_predicting_a_2030_share/", "is_self": true}
