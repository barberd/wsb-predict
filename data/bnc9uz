He called me to basically brag about how smart he was for finding this great stock. I congratulated him and strongly advised him, multiple times, to cash out at least 2000 dollars (I suggested 5000). That would leave him with 3/4 (or more) of his original shares and he would be playing with house money. If the stock continued shooting up he would be filthy rich either way, but if the shares tanked in value then at least he wouldn\u2019t be out any money.\n\nNot only did he not listen to me, he invested more and lost absolutely all of it. I found out later that ALL the money he invested ($10000) was actually from a loan he had taken out to try his hand in the stock market. If I had known that I would have been even more adamant about cashing out (imagine paying off a $10000 loan in a week and still having 10k in the bank)... but I don\u2019t think he would have listened to me no matter what I said.\n\nJust a funny anecdote: In the midst of this, he gave his mom a birthday card that contained a single dollar bill and he wrote inside \u201cthis is the first of millions\u201d.\n\nMy friend is an idiot.", "created_utc": 1557582697, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bnc9uz/i_heard_you_all_might_like_my_friend_xpost_from_a/", "is_self": true}
