Gamestops current short interest is 99.19.... 99 fucking percent of gamestops shares are short. By comparison, Hertz, a company that is literally bankrupt, has a short interest of 35.62. Even after a shit earnings on 6/09, the dip in stock price was quickly bought up. With the recent drop today, it seems like a good opportunity to grab some calls to capitalize on one of the largest short squeezes we will ever see.  When it comes to high short interest, any type of positive news should cause a rip your face off rally. Even negative news can cause a rip your face off rally. \n\nGamestop is like a coked up hobo with a massive hard on. Hes definitely gonna crash and die eventually, but hes sure to explode up a few times before he does. \n\nTLDR:\n\nGME 6/19 5.5 Call\n\nGME 6/26 6 Call", "created_utc": 1591890748.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h11wkf/gme_dd_the_short_squeeze_of_all_short_squeezes/", "is_self": true}
