Markets will still keep moving on juked optimism, as both the Trump administration and China need to provide some support for domestic political reasons. The sad reality is that the gap in interests is simply too wide to close. A real deal would need to address:\n\n1. All tariffs/trade restrictions that have been put in place since the start of the trade war, which cover almost all Chinese goods with few exceptions. China likewise has not moved at all on U.S. nonfarm products.\n2. Fundamental U.S.-China disagreement on IP protection and tech transfers.\n3. Balanced currency valuations when both parties want relative devaluations for competitive advantage.\n4. Agreement on allowable level of subsidies to state-owned and state-supported companies.\n\nSuffice it to say this shit ain't gonna happen.", "created_utc": 1572365616, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dos17v/on_trade_optimism/", "is_self": true}
