Here's why.", "selftext": " \n\nI'm  taking TD Ameritrade's options course right now, and I've had this  question for a while. I knew that IV, the underlying, and time to  expiration all priced into an option's price, but I always had the hunch  that supply and demand did as well. And here is a clear explanation  that it does, and why. I did not write this. This was on the free  educational course.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo,  let\u2019s take a moment to answer this question when you buy or sell  an  option, who is on the other side of that transaction? The answer is a  **market maker**.\u00a0\n\nThe  job of a market maker is to facilitate the trade. However, this   doesn\u2019t always mean that market makers take the other side of the trade   and are bearish when you\u2019re bullish, or vice versa. In fact, in most   cases their goal is to not have to hold the other side of the trade   (though they will if no other traders are interested). Instead, they aim   to match up buyers with sellers so that they don\u2019t have to take the   other side and take on more risk. To achieve this, they change the price   of options up or down to make the other side more attractive to   prospective traders.\n\nBecause  market makers are always there to buy or sell options, they  can be seen  as an economic good. To understand this, put yourself in the  shoes of a  portfolio manager. Suppose you need to buy a particular  options  contract to manage the risk of your portfolio. It\u2019s beneficial  to you  that there is someone out there willing to make a deal with you  and  offer you what you\u2019re looking for. Of course, if you\u2019re asking for   something that isn\u2019t widely traded, the price may not be favorable.", "created_utc": 1585862823.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ftuxz6/does_supply_and_demand_affection_options_pricing/", "is_self": true}
