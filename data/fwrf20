{"id": "fwrf20", "title": "Living in SF and Rejoining the Bulls", "selftext": "The past month has been a roller coaster of emotions. In the panic of the moment after the San Francisco shelter in place, I gave up all my principles and joined the \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bteam. I spent my life savings of tendies buying badly conceived and vastly overpriced SPY puts trying desperately to hedge the market. But then JPow delivered his big stimulus and it wrecked me. Deaths were skyrocketing, businesses were shuttered, and the market continued to climb as I watched my \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4cturn to coal.\n\nI spent days in a haze of cognitive dissonance. Had I made the wrong choice? Was my lifestyle as a \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bkilling me? I finally left the house to go to downtown SF to the one store I could find bread flour to snort instead of the cocaine that I could no longer afford.\n\nOn the ride back, along Market Street I saw a homeless man. Not just any homeless man. It was a beacon of light from the universe through the dark days of the beer flu. He was squatting in a shuttered business's storefront, eagerly shoving a dildo into and out of his asshole, all the while maintaining 6 feet of separation from anyone around him. At that moment I realized that, even through all of this, the city of San Francisco would come out even stronger and that the economy was going to be OK. I'm back. All in bulls. SPY 420C 6/9.
