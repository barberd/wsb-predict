{"id": "g320uu", "title": "Why aren\u2019t bears talking about puts on small caps?", "selftext": "While SPY refuses to fall, small cap ETFs like SCHA and SPSM, micro cap IWC, and non-US small caps VSS are all looking more bearish.\n\nI\u2019m pretty confident that things are shittier than the SPY reflects, but the juggernauts like Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Netflix, etc are concealing this. AMZN is up 17% this week, with 4% and an ATH Thursday. MSFT and AAPL are up 10% this week, FB 4%, JNJ 7%. That\u2019s about 20% of the S&amp;amp;P right there. That\u2019s a lot of green dildos to spread around.\n\nSPY is up about 4% this week, while IWC and SCHA are down almost 5% each. SPSM is down over 6%. \n\nAm I misreading the situation? My main concern is that they are already down 30%+ from a few months ago so maybe it\u2019s pRiCeD iN. But it seems like small and mid-sized companies have a lot more hurt coming.\n\nWhy is there no talk about this in r/wsb, r/investing, or r/options? Are there any small cap (or micro/nano) ETFs I should add to the list? Most are too small for options.\n\nI\u2019ll edit in my positions when they print, but I\u2019m looking for puts on the four ETFs mentioned. Cash for now.\n\nEdit: Decided to skip VSS, added IWM which has better volume.\n\nSCHA 52p 5/15\n\nSPSM 22p 5/15\n\nSPSM 21p 9/18\n\nIWC 55p 9/18\n\nIWM 107p 5/29", "created_utc": 1587130196.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g320uu/why_arent_bears_talking_about_puts_on_small_caps/", "is_self": true}
