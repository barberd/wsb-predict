{"id": "gex3ne", "title": "Update on Tankers", "selftext": " Alright autists and retards, everybody has been losing money on tankers this last week but I have news for you: your weak hands are the only reason you are losing money on tankers.\n\nIt may be a surprise to everyone under the age of 14 that the situation the tanker industry is in has happened twice in the past decade. There is a strong correlation between the oil contango and the market price of tanker stocks.\n\nAs you can see here from Euronav's investor update in April\n\n[https://imgur.com/UFgjZa5](https://imgur.com/UFgjZa5)\n\nNow that I have shown that the two are related let's take a look at the contango history:\n\n[https://imgur.com/e4Jwn76](https://imgur.com/e4Jwn76)\n\nLet's compare that to the stock price history of say STNG, NAT, ASC, FRO, and DHT:\n\n[https://imgur.com/iruMQGf](https://imgur.com/iruMQGf)\n\nIn 2008 and 2015 when the oil contango was at its highest (UNTIL NOW) these stocks were at 5-10 times what they are valued at now. It is important to note that the contango spike precedes the tanker stock price by about 6 months. But how is the contango rising compared to 2008? much faster and steadier ([https://imgur.com/oz4DplY](https://imgur.com/oz4DplY) ) What I am saying now is that these stocks are apollo 11 and you still have a chance to jump on the shuttle.\n\nLooking at earnings reports from STNG and DHT we see that they nearly made as much as the entire fiscal year of 2018 IN ONE QUARTER. No link cause I'm lazy and you people need to learn to do your own DD.\n\nSo everyone knows that the spot price is for these ships is up to as much as $110,000 (or at least you should know this because its over twice the standard rate and is RIDICULOUS) but what does that mean. Looking at ASC\u2019s earnings report (I picked this one to show because its the most clear and easy to read) we can see \"Any increase in TCE goes fully to the bottom line, with every $10,000 / day increase in TCE adding approximately $90 million in earnings and cashflow annually.\"\n\nfrom ASC's highlights in the earnings report: [https://imgur.com/FNXyDMC](https://imgur.com/FNXyDMC)\n\nSo lets say they only are making $20,000 more per day per ship (its much more) and lets pick a small company like ASC that has a very small fleet of 20 tankers. That's a lot of tendies.\n\nWhat's the risk? U.S. tensions with the middle east could escalate and cut of transportation routes but I think this is very unlikely considering the pandemic.\n\nAre you worried COVID will bounce back and tank the economy so you don't want to invest? If that happens oil will go down again, storage will increase again and you will be drowning in so much cocaine and hookers you'll literally die.\n\n6-12 month calls will all be guaranteed profit at the +10-25% range. I think it could go as high as 400% in a year but I don\u2019t know the future.\n\nBuy real stocks for safety.\n\nBuy the dip faggots.", "created_utc": 1588814681.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gex3ne/update_on_tankers/", "is_self": true}
