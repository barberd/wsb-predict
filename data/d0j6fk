A Hearing Panel found that Shaalan violated the CFA Institute Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct: I(C)- Misrepresentation; I(D) \u2013 Misconduct; III(A) \u2013 Duties to Clients (Loyalty, Prudence, and Care); III(C) \u2013 Suitability; and V(C) \u2013 Record Retention (2014). The Hearing Panel\u2019s decision was subsequently reviewed and affirmed on appeal.\n \nCFA Institute found that, starting in June 2016, an investor in the United Arab Emirates hired Shaalan to manage and invest money she had set aside for retirement. He met with the investor and told her about his investment strategies. Afterwards, Shaalan emailed her a document in which he downplayed the extreme risks associated with his strategies, putting the potential loss at 10% or less, while the potential profit was touted as 60% to 80% per annum.\n \nShaalan instructed the investor to open a brokerage account with Saxo Bank and to provide him with her username and password so that he could then gain access and trade in the account. In just 22 days, however, Shaalan had lost $195,000 of the $200,000 that the investor had deposited into the account.\n \nDespite having lost almost all of the client\u2019s money, Shaalan requested that she wire him additional money to invest. This time, he instructed her to send the funds directly to his personal bank account. As a result, the client wired Shaalan an additional $45,000 to invest. Shaalan told her that the $45,000 infusion would help him tune the mathematical and cognitive limits of his investment strategy and potentially recover the $195,000 lost.\n \nWithin several weeks of receiving the additional $45,000, Shaalan informed the client that he had invested and lost it all. The investor\u2019s total loss of $240,000 represents approximately 80% of the money she had saved for retirement.", "created_utc": 1567788355, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d0j6fk/guy_loses_cfa_charter_because_he_lost_80_of_his/", "is_self": true}
