Tianjin Airlines from Wuhan to Paris lands in 4 hours and 2 minutes. If you live in Paris we need your help ASAP. We need you to go to baggage claim and await this plane's arrival. Pose as a driver, maybe, and hold a sign like \"Mr. Wu Han\" to blend in.\n\nYou can then gather information like the number of people on board. One of their A330's can seat 293 people so we can actually get a solid percentage to work off.\n\nPay attention, this is where it gets important. Befriend one of the Chinese passengers (if there even are any) and invite them for a french kiss as a sign of welcoming them to your country. Now that you've gained their trust, bring them to the bathroom. Flush the toilet and ask them if the Chinese government is lying. Don't worry, you tell them, Xi can't hear them from here.\n\nReport back with your findings. Hurry! 3 hours and 55 minutes until touchdown.
