This likely means camps will close too. \n\nNJ and other surrounding states likely to follow. \n\nThis is fucking insane as no parents have a clue what to do now, as businesses will start to re-open, but what exactly are kids supposed to do if both parents go back to work? \n\nWell, they won't, especially not anyone getting those sweet unemployment checks that are at/above their regular wages. So now not only will businesses barely be able to re-open, but who the fuck is gonna go there? \n\nPuts on any businesses w/ a core presence/revenue generation on the East Coast, and the \"recovery\".\n\nSBUX 70P 5/08\n\nSIX 12.5P 5/15\n\nSPY 229 P 5/15\n\nDIS 90P 5/15\n\nFB 162.5 P 5/22\n\nSPY 145 P 5/29\n\nNFLX 240P 6/05\n\nSIX 12.5P 6/19\n\nBYND 65P 6/19\n\nDRI 60P 7/17\n\nIWM 95P 8/21\n\nBYND 50P 8/21\n\nIWM 95P 9/18\n\nand a whole bunch of worthless fucking USO1 leaps cause i'm a dumbass.", "created_utc": 1588351651.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gbln6o/puts_on_east_coast_recovery/", "is_self": true}
