{"id": "blxpln", "title": "Selling Options To You Idiots To Pay My Bar Tabs - My little secret on making money with IV crush", "selftext": "Ok so you veterans are going to say \"yeah, I've seen this, it's not a secret\", but for you amateurs, this is your first time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou make the most money **selling** very high Implied Volatility (IV) options if they don't end up in the money.  Hell, even if they do end up slightly in the money, it's still worth it.  I check this site to see the **current highest IV stocks**:\n\n [https://www.barchart.com/options/highest-implied-volatility/stocks](https://www.barchart.com/options/highest-implied-volatility/stocks) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUsually it's Tesla puts in there (except they got some funding, so the fear of bankruptcy has been removed), with some earnings plays, recent IPOs ($LYFT, $PINS), weed stocks, and pharma stuff with upcoming FDA decisions sprinkled in.  This gives me a good idea of what I should sell you cucks when you think you're going to make money on a big move.  The whole first page is filled with crazy shit (150%-200%+ IV) and the second+ page is usually more \"normal\" for IV plays.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday, a stock $TEUM showed up in the list and I hadn't seen it before, so I decided to give it a look.  Some random shit tech comm company.  The IV was 272% - 322%, which is high as a motherfucker.  Most stocks that I hold are 25%-55%.  $TEUM reported earnings after the bell today, hence the high IV.  The options expire next Friday 5/17.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe stock was trading around $4.80-$5.20 today, and there were put options saying the stock was going to go to $2.50 for 10c/ea, or going to go up to $7.50 for 30c/ea.  The $TEUM options were basically saying that by next Friday, the stock was either **going to drop by 50%, or go up 50%.  No in between.**  I figured there's no fucking way.  And even if earnings are either good or bad, there will be IV crush (the implied volatility of the stock will diminish and thus the option will be worth less because there is nothing to move the stock strongly in either direction), and the stock won't actually move THAT much.  Even if the stock moves 49% by next Friday, I still keep all of the premium that you deposited into my \"hookers and blow\" fund.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor comparative purposes, I'll use Tesla, another high IV stock.  It's now $247 a share.  Let's round up to $250.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSelling these TEUM options is basically saying that by next Friday, after earnings, Tesla will go to $125 (-50%), or it will go to $375 (+50%).  Yeah fucking right.  If I extrapolated these options costs, it's like saying you'd pay $5 ($500 per contract) to have Tesla drop to $120 (-52%) and then you'd break even.  Or pay $15 ($1,500) to have Tesla trade above $390 (+56%), and you'd break even.  I'd still make $500 or $1,500 if it closed even a penny shy.  Per contract.  Hell, even if it closed slightly outside the strike price, I can buy the contract back for like, what, $50 to $150?  I still keep the difference.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost likely, Tesla would trade from the current price of $250 to maybe $200 at the lowest (20% drop), or $300 at the highest (20% increase) from an earnings release.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd yeah IV is priced based on the expected move of a particular stock based on its past price movements and expected future movements, so you can't compare one stock to another, but sometimes it's just too good to be true.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI sold NAKED puts and calls at $2.50 and $7.50 (couldn't get the $10's to fill).  I have the cash and portfolio size ($550k) to back it up should things go awry.  When $TEUM announced earnings after hours, **their stock basically remained unchanged.**  **Fucking SUCKS for people who bought options.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRemember, even if the stock were to drop or pop 49% between now and next Friday, I keep all of that sweet premium and your options that you bought from me expire completely worthless.  Double Lagavulin, neat.  Plus a Dogfish Head 90 min IPA  And the king crab leg appetizer.  Btw, you're paying for it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe moral of the story is, **never buy high IV options.**  I consider high IV to be 80%.  And I get rabid about selling options when it's above 100%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHopefully you learned something.  Don't be a dumb cuck.  **Stop buying high IV FD's because you hardly ever win.**", "created_utc": 1557270732, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/blxpln/selling_options_to_you_idiots_to_pay_my_bar_tabs/", "is_self": true}
