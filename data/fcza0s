LVS is gonna fucking tank.  \n\nRationale:\n\nThis shit can't be oversold, so don't worry about RSI.  From '08 to '09, it went all the way down from **130 a share to 2.80.  I. Kid. You. Not.**  Now, if you're a gay bear like me, you know a recession is coming.  I mean the fucking Fed has played all its cards early, and rate cuts don't prevent a global pandemic.  If the markets behave similarly to '08, LVS is gonna have a tough time.  Also, not to mention, Macau gaming revenues are down 88%, **so there's that too I guess.**  \n\nMy point is if you too like to suck dick, and you are coincidentally a bear, this might be the perfect way to lose all your money and tank your IRA.  Just sayin'.  \n\nDrill Squad for life.", "created_utc": 1583261244, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fcza0s/lvs_to_the_center_of_the_earth/", "is_self": true}
