Literally take any strike on the QQQ going out 1-2 years and you will make 100-1500x. This is just nuts, all of you should just all buy these right now if you want to be guaranteed millionaires. I am so scared the SEC is going to go after me because this just feels like cheating. My mom always told me I was autistic, am I going to make it big like Michael Burry?
