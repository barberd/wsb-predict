{"id": "eyalla", "title": "Literally free money", "selftext": "For all the permabears losing money today, I have good news: I found a way to make free money. Last week I wanted to stock up on masks from Target so that I can sell them to sick patients once the crisis hits. So I ordered 100 cheap single-use paper masks for $10. But today I got an email saying that they ran out of stock and had to cancel my order BUT they gave me a $5 coupon code plus initial $10, so if we're thinking about this in a capitalistic sense, I made a 50% return in coupon codes. Now, this doesn't work with any online shop, another one \"cancelled my order in order to donate masks for the sick and hospitals that need them\". (Wtf why would you donate something when you can make those sick Shkreli tendies?)\n\nBut yeah, aside from those stores it's LITERALLY FREE MONEY WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR\n\nThis trick may also work with food stamps, but I'm not sure - I'm not a bear so I'm not on food stamps, obviously", "created_utc": 1580751285, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eyalla/literally_free_money/", "is_self": true}
