Issues are primarily scaling to the volume which has increased significantly during past few days. For example, Friday SPY registered volume of some 385-400 million against an average of 134 million. I am guessing RH infra isn't used to such volume. I have experienced this first hand plenty of times lately. For example, limit orders at market open are just bad bets and almost always will turn in losses for options. Regardless of the actual price of the option, it have consistently filled my order at my limit price, which can hurt pretty bad while buying if the option price is significantly cheaper than your limit entry. Yesterday only RH executed TSLA 3/06 500 Puts for $3 each where as the bid-ask was in the range of $1, I instantly lost 2$ per contract because of this shit and its not the first time. My bad for putting limit orders as I didn't wanna get up early on my freaking birthday (PST 630). \n\nTLDR: They've clearly mentioned that outages are infrastructure issue which reflect about poor scaling architecture design.  This means it's a bigger problem to fix and such outages will definitely continue at least in near future which is a bad sign for us to trade options which is a blink and miss game. I will be moving to ToS as there's absolutely no reason to stay with RH at this point.", "created_utc": 1583285357.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fd5arv/update_from_robinhood_on_the_outages/", "is_self": true}
