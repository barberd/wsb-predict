{"id": "h815b5", "title": "What's a good exit strategy for deep OTM options (3 months out)?", "selftext": "I  bought some deep OTM puts on IWM, SPY, and QQQ because I  expect a market decline to occur before the presidential election.\n\nSince these options have high vega, would it be best to  sell them after one big red day, or should I hold for more? The  intrinsic value of them wouldn't be that good: for example, I have SPY  11/20/2020 240P. I'm not even so sure it will drop that far, but vega is  0.5 and IV is 40% right now, and I think more people will make this  bet, driving IV up and then the premium up because of vega. If SPY even  dropped to $200, then I'd only have: $40 \\* 100 - $846.00 in intrinsic  value, which is less than I hope to make.\n\nSo  how long can I hold deep OTM options for without starting to lose due  to theta decay? For the SPY put, right now theta is 0.05, current price  is $8.27.\n\nPositions:\n\nIWM 11/20/2020 115.00 P\n\nSPY 11/20/2020 240.00 P\n\nQQQ 11/20/2020 210.00 P\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: \\*over 3 months out.", "created_utc": 1592025192.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h815b5/whats_a_good_exit_strategy_for_deep_otm_options_3/", "is_self": true}
