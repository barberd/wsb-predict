Everything that happens and causes a price change someone on a sub says it was priced in already. I can't play this 16d chess game! I can't even play with 1d. Papa Powell is too busy for me to play with his 1d at least. But guys seriously! I've done research and realized there are huge gains if we find things that aren't priced in already. This is huge. But we gotta go big. Like what about alien invasion? Is that priced in? I've run some numbers using my cheese ball abacus and unless I stuffed too many balls in my mouth, I believe we can make tons of moolah. \n\nIt would be a huge disaster which means markets should go up beyond the norm. I'm thinking like 40% in a week. Since aliens would bring their own futuristic probing devices and research i think we can safely bet against anything heavily involved in prostate exams, anal pleasures, and thermometers. Rectal insertion device prices would go down probably. And then we could probably bet that defense contractors would increase in profits by bartering minorities for futuristic weaponry. \n\nSeriously. Think about it. If the invasion happens one of two things happens. Cheap anal tools and stonks for days. Or we get wiped out at which point it doesn't matter. \n\nFellow autists, I need to know. Has anyone got DD that indicates its priced in though? If it is I might as well start crying into my Waifu Trump pillow now rather than later.", "created_utc": 1586626823.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fzb22o/am_i_too_late_is_everything_priced_in/", "is_self": true}
