Our town kinda missed the '08 crisis because of how deep we are in the government sector. Not to many people lost their jobs either, sure things got tight for a lot of families, including mine. But we didn't struggle.  So, it got me thinking of ways to 'play it safe' this go around.\n\nIf the space race becomes a thing again, there will need to be new infrastructure, engineering, management and implementation. Since that is usually handled via government contractors I pulled out the El Google search bar. Typed in the big government contractors...\n\nCame up with - Boeing, Lockhead Martin, Raytheon, SAIC,  Northrup Grumman, and General Dynamics.\n\nThen, I looked up quite a few companies involved in infrastructure and providing communications in the gov contracting world - Verizon, AT&amp;T, Leidos, HP, level 3 (now CenturyLink), Booze Allen (he's not just a drunk guy), Deloitte... You get the picture.\n\nWhat I'm going to do, here me out, is place these companies on a dart board at my local bar. Take 5 darts and throw them. The 5 I hit, I'm buying call leaps 7-10% OTM. \n\nThoughts on my play?\n\n*I will post the dart board before, after, and work on buying my leaps and provide positions along the way.", "created_utc": 1566373516, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ctdjnq/i_am_about_to_do_a_little_gambling_on_government/", "is_self": true}
