Agreed to partner with IC Immune to work to develop the tau aggregation inhibitor, focusing primarily on AC Immune\u2019s ACI-3024 to treat Alzheimer's disease. \u00a0\u201cLilly also agreed to pay AC Immune CHF 60 million ($60.3 million) tied to achieving near-term development milestones, as well as up to approximately CHF 1.7 billion ($1.7 billion) in payments tied to achieving development, regulatory, and commercial milestones, plus tiered royalty payments in the low double digits.\u201d\n\n[https://www.genengnews.com/news/lilly-ac-immune-launch-1-9b-collaboration-on-alzheimers-n](https://www.genengnews.com/news/lilly-ac-immune-launch-1-9b-collaboration-on-alzheimers-neurodegenerative-treatments/)\n\nI trust the big names in the industry, you should to. LLY, if you were not already aware, is forefront in the manufacturing neuroscience products, they already manufacture and sell Cymbalta, Zyprexa, Strattera, Prozac and Amyvid, which all deal with neurological disorders.\n\nI am confident that LLY would not have signed a multi million dollar deal with IC Immune if they were not sure that there was a bright future for their Alzheimer's product.\n\n\u201cThis landmark partnership with Lilly is transformational for the future of AC Immune,\u201d AC Immune CEO Andrea Pfeifer, Ph.D., declared in a statement. \u201cLilly\u2019s substantial experience in neurology, and particularly in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, is a major validation of our small molecule platform for CNS therapeutics. It also demonstrates the potential of our preclinical assets and adds substantial value to our pipeline. We look forward to working closely with Lilly in this exciting field over the coming years.\u201d\n\n[https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-and-ac-immune-announce-license-and-collaboration-agreement](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-and-ac-immune-announce-license-and-collaboration-agreement)\n\nLastly, for all the skeptics out there that like to point out that the stock chart looks something like a series of plateaus. The reason for this is the discontinuation of AC Immune's collaboration with partner Roche Holdings. AC Immune announced early 2019 that it was discontinuing the CREAD 1 and CREAD 2 studies. These phase 3 trials were testing AC Immune's drug crenezumab. This bad news sparked negative headlines that caused a drastic sell off over one drug, a small portion of AC immunes pipeline.\n\nBelow I posted IC Immunes Pipeline to let you guys decide if the discontinuation of one drug justified a 60% price decrease.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n[https://www.acimmune.com/en/pipeline-overview/](https://www.acimmune.com/en/pipeline-overview/)\n\nTLDR: ACIU\u2019s ER cannot disappoint because of the cash from LLY partnership", "created_utc": 1552951104, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b2pmzn/ac_immune_aciu/", "is_self": true}
