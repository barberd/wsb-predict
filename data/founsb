But at 9:30-9:31AM I was trying to cancel because it wasn't getting filled. My limit sell order remained and at the end of the day I got a confirmation that it was sold. \n\nHad I just kept it the whole day, I would've made $1K more. \n\nAnyone else get responses from Robinhood?\n\nScreenshot of position that I couldn't close: https://i.imgur.com/W7WvbwY.jpg\n\n\n\nEDIT: For those who signed the DocuSign with no dollar amount in place.\n\n> Sorry for the confusion, but you should ignore the previous DocuSign email.
