Now, on January 28th, Blizzard is going to be releasing Warcraft 3 Reforged, the re-release of a hugely popular games back in the 00's.  Trust me all of you or your nerd friends will be playing this thing, and best of all it's impossible to fuck up in game design since the gameplay is already proven to be popular, they just have to update the skins and they'll make millions.  They are nowhere near all time highs and are in a upward trend, so the only thing to do is BUY BUY BUY now while you can.
