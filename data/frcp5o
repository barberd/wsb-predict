WWE has the Network which is a constant monthly revenue stream. Although, they aren\u2019t running house shows or other arena shows (are Wrestlemania) and this is a big chunk of their projected revenue. Their top drAw just removed himself from Mania because of health factors. Other wrestlers (Mike Mizanin and Dana Brooke) were sent home because they were ill. All Vince McMahon needs is one of his employees to really fall ill and weekly tv may come to halt. Also Vince just sold a ton of stock to help cover costs while WWE is essentially closed to the public. I rode WWE down from the $40 range to $30 then took tendies. \nChances of this coming to fruition: 79%\n\n2. Apple drops nearly 50% in stock price. \nI\u2019m currently holding 1/2021 $250c and maybe I was just paranoid about the potential double circuit breaker tomorrow, who knows. Maybe I\u2019ll look into AAPL $150p over the next few months. Most of Apple\u2019s products (if not all, do the DD yourself. This is a shitpost) are made in China. There could be a big hit coming along with the rest of the market? I\u2019d imagine AAPL next earnings call won\u2019t be overly positive. Either way, I don\u2019t think it will drop that low, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t make money off it.\n\n3. $30,000\nI kept seeing this number. $30,000, over and over again in my dream. My personal investing account is around 14k so I\u2019m not sure what 30k is alluding to. Maybe that\u2019s the amount I\u2019ll make off those potential 5/15 AAPL $150p that I\u2019ll look into tomorrow. Whatever. \n\nTL/DR it\u2019s not worth reading. Joe Exotic is a fucking nut. \n\nCurrent position : drinking on my couch\n5/15 SPY $250p", "created_utc": 1585513798.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frcp5o/i_had_a_dream/", "is_self": true}
