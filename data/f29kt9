NASA Pays you 'anything you say' + %commission based on 'anything you say'. If you want more money from NASA you just tell it costed more. That's all. **Just tell me how this can go tits up**.\n\n2. This made Space travel super competitive, meaning they even consider nuclear energy to cargo more stuff/ people with less cost. we can call it parabolic liftoff, we can call it free tendies.\n\n3. Autists will be able to eat tends on the way to Saturn or shit.\n\n4. NASA prefers $SPACEX and $BA so far. SO AMZN LMT SPCE is not priced in yet. \n\n5. Don't forget Russia (yeah Chernobyl is a nice place to launch) and China (coronarocket can be built in 1 week they say) as you clearly see Tendies for bears too!\n\n6. No space city tho, unless we talk with r/startup. Tesla is Plan A to save the earth, SpaceX is plan B. YO R/startup you can sell it to Elon as plan C, cmon.\n\n7. $AAPL calls for \"For all mankind\" and puts for iPad stolen from Battlestar Galactica.", "created_utc": 1581433673, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f29kt9/dd_spacex_and_ba_but_also_spce_amzn_lmt/", "is_self": true}
