CEO said on the last quarter's call that this quarter (q1) will be one of their best quarters and advised all analysts to raise their estimates upward and no one did lmao. so a revenue beat is priced in even if headlines say they smashed estimates, their beat is pretty much the \"worst kept secret\" on the street. if you really want to play tandem earnings, i suggest selling calls or puts (calls are probably better as i'm expecting a sell-off) as the IV is retarded high (120%+)\n\nhowever, DXCM is primed for an explosive move on 5/1 (wednesday). the stock has been hammered recently by a spruce point research report that drove the stock down 15% and even further down by this medicare for all bullshit that punished healthcare, medtech and biotech sectors.\n\nthe medicare for all bullshit headlines are subsiding, if you've been following the biggest names like ANTM, HUM, UNH etc they're all pretty much saying fuck you to this medicare-for-all bullshit and raised guidance. i don't want to get into how retarded this socialist policy is and how fiscally impossible it is on a budget level but that's a whole different story. either way, i'm mentioning it because the headlines have provided some beautiful buying opportunities for some great stocks, especially DXCM\n\nthe spruce point report is actual garbage. i actually love spruce point, i respect them a lot and they are probably the best short firms to follow in the business. however, their DXCM report is actual hot garbage and it's clear that they know very little about the industry. if you want to sift through the report, here's a link - https://www.sprucepointcap.com/dexcom-inc/\n\nthe report hit headlines and brought the stock down a significant amount, probably flushing out retail traders who don't know jack shit about anything. the dead giveaway is that spruce mentioned inventory pullforward which doesn't even exist in this industry because dexcom is literally supply co. trained, they have no inventory to even stock. the only that's remotely true in the short report is Libre 2 overhang (ABT is the biggest competitor in the space) but that was universally known and that risk is mostly priced in at this point - ABT in their call mentioned that they filed for regulatory approval already and DXCM didn't move at all. everyone knows that Libre 2 is coming, it's just a matter of when and dexcom is already so far ahead in the U.S compared to ABT that it's basically a non-factor at this point\n\ntldr - mark my words - DXCM will be a $200 stock within a year. garbage short report and dumb medicare-for-all risk provided an extremely attractive buying price at these levels. this earnings quarter will set the tone for the rest of the year, they will not only smash revenue estimates but also raise guidance and i'm predicting at least a 10% pop on earnings day. best play is to just straight up hold equity and hold long or june 21st options -135/140 strike. i don't play options dated 1 month or less but that's up to you", "created_utc": 1556497218, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bii0b1/dexcom/", "is_self": true}
