Instead of giving each other shitty investment ideas, lets work together to come up decisions backed with facts and actual DD. I know, crazy idea, but it just might work. \n\nI think it's time we get together and shift the culture that we have created at WSB of idolizing YOLO's to something that benefits us all. So lets start here:\n\nCMG:\n\nTechnical analysis: If CMG manages to stay below 750, the technical indicate that the stock is on it's way to 710. If momentum keeps up we may see sub 700. The stock is overvalued and market is correcting this. My calculations show the intrinsic value is $608/share (but every stock is inflated so I don't expect it to fall to that price point)\n\nCustomer Analysis: rising competition in the food industry has effect this stock with supplement items. I don't see as many people waiting in line as I used to see, and the quality isn't the same that it used to be.\n\nBusiness Analysis: Shift to a retain customers using app is a genuine idea that many corporations are using to keep customers coming. But the cost of running the app, running promotions eats the bottom line. \n\nFeel free to share your insight/experience on this analysis, but from where this stands I see CMG falling. If this stays below 750 tomorrow I will pick up puts.", "created_utc": 1573001201, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ds8imb/cmg_analysis/", "is_self": true}
