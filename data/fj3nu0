{"id": "fj3nu0", "title": "Brief Military Medical Update (more tomorrow)", "selftext": "TLDR: Stop movement order til May, medical response teams being prepared, many decisions to be made tomorrow.\n\nThe Department of Defense has issued a stop movement order from 3/16-5/11.\n\nI'm in the military healthcare system, and the medical centers are rapidly standing up response teams to address the pandemic. The focus has become making it through the next few days, not the next few weeks. Senior leadership are still determining what movement will be permitted, and we are expected to learn more tomorrow after the higher ups meet up. I'm expecting these teams may be activated to help in areas of Washington and California at the very least. There are military hospitals at Travis AFB in Northern California, Camp Pendleton in Oceanside, Naval Medical Center in San Diego, and Madigan in Seattle.\n\nStay tuned for more updates.  \n\n\nEDIT: Link to the order, thought it was old news from 2 days ago: [https://media.defense.gov/2020/Mar/13/2002264686/-1/-1/1/STOP-MOVEMENT-FOR-ALL-DOMESTIC-TRAVEL-FOR-DOD-COMPONENTS-IN-RESPONSE-TO-CORONAVIRUS-2019.PDF](https://media.defense.gov/2020/Mar/13/2002264686/-1/-1/1/STOP-MOVEMENT-FOR-ALL-DOMESTIC-TRAVEL-FOR-DOD-COMPONENTS-IN-RESPONSE-TO-CORONAVIRUS-2019.PDF)", "created_utc": 1584288681.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fj3nu0/brief_military_medical_update_more_tomorrow/", "is_self": true}
