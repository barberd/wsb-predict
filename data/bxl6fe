{"id": "bxl6fe", "title": "$FIS and $WP Deal", "selftext": "Hello I am fecal\\_destruction. You may know me from my wraith of fecal destruction waves, currently sweeping the nation.   \n\n\nI appreciate knowing about catalyst opportunities because i feel like that is really a huge part of picking plays. So here's one i recently discovered. Nothing too exciting but its worth a blip on the RADAR...  \n\n\n$FIS is currently undergoing antitrust legislation with the EU over their $WP takeover.. WP is a payment processing company. \n\n  \nWhy and how is this a catalyst? The EU regulators gave a date...  July 5th is the last day they have before making a decision on approval. \n\n  \nPersonally I'm thinking short term bearish on $FIS, there is multiple bearish engulfing daily candles on higher volume seen in the last 10 trading days. They are currently at the resistance.\n\nFIS caught my eye as a TA short play, but i noticed they had this EU antitrust shit.. I have no opinion on whether that gets approved or not. Only thing of value to consider is that EU tends to be more strict on corporations then the US to protect consumers. \n\n  \n**SOURCES:**  \n [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eu-regulators-decide-fis-35-083636145.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eu-regulators-decide-fis-35-083636145.html)   \n [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FIS](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FIS)", "created_utc": 1559850877, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bxl6fe/fis_and_wp_deal/", "is_self": true}
