Aspiring autist says to buy puts on media companies, the drop is far from over. YOLO\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDigital Media is on the brink of collapse because its revenue sources are mostly fraudulent without these events.  The media spend on the ad campaigns for these giant sporting events make up a significant portion of a media operation's annual revenue, up to half of annual revenue in some cases. For example, March Madness is the Back-to-School event of the spring and each season another media company gets its slice of the advertising pie.  You can make your determinations on what the events are each month owned by which media companies that advertisers spend vasts amount of money to reach large audiences to hit forecast targets.  These seasonal-events are mostly directly-sold between the advertiser and the media company (publisher), and these deals have been sold for months (even years) and forecasted against.  These deals are the ones negotiated by salespeople making obscene amounts of comissions and still done through handshake at tradeshows that are being canceled as we speak, these large contracts are accounted for in every years budget; their budgets designed with them in mind.  Keep in mind the digital media that is sold during these events are different than the normal digital ads you see each day (display, search) that are sold 'programmatically' through ad exchanges and social media platforms which countless tech companies act as middle-man getting a piece of the advertiser's media spend, media companies will never make up the difference by trying to make up revenue in other channels, there's simply no replacement for these large-scale scheduled events.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSimply put, Direct-sold campaigns are 'good' money because of direct relationship with the revenue source , 'Programmatic' campaigns are 'bad' money because money frequently gets stuck in the ad delivery chain.  Programmatic Ad Deals are 'bad' money because it is rife with ad fraud, and as the economy slows down the incentive to commit fraud on the open internet just skyrocketed. I wrote a [post about this a year ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/adops/comments/c08ppe/what_adtech_companies_are_selling_tech_that/er2z1v6/?context=3) to /r/adops autists. Fradulent ad inventory will only go up as the weeks pass, incentive increases and cost stays the same.  With no technology/solution in place to combat ad fraud these media dollars that were once guaranteed to be placed into the media company's pocket to pay everyone's salary is now completely unspent (or used to pay off gambling debts in the stock market) and smart Media Buyers will know it is not a good time to be spending on Digital Media.  This will have a rolling effect on the economy, without layoffs, we haven't seen anything yet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWho cares about digital ads? Banner ads are like fraction of pennies!  Digital Media is a super high-margin business where the cost is effectively zero and the values are made up so it deserves a lot of attention. Digital Media only maintains its profitability because these large scale deals act as a baseline to prop up the rest of the industry.  Recent news reports clearly show that Media Companies have lost their only 'real' source of revenue already, therefore shit is tanking on water and they are scrambling to look for ways to make up for the loss in their upcoming reports.  Salespeople are desperately finding ways to make up for lost commissions and it will only get harder when they're not able to make old-school face-to-face deals (that they're still so fond of them for some reason) due to travel restrictions and quarantine, and I'm certain many will fall into the trap of making fraudulent deals with bad partners that will never show up in accounts receivable in the coming months.  Digital Media is the economic engine for all of the non-journalistic media companies, so when that market shrinks, the sites that run clickbait listicles wont survive because spending on digital media does not outpace the economic damage from COVID-19 which infects exponentially while the industry stagnates and sinks; it has no conceivable way of catching up.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSure, someone who thinks everything fine might believe that more people staying at home could mean more ad exposure, but what good is ad exposure if no one is going outside to buy cars?  Why spend ad money if no one is buying products? (and tbh, during lockdown do free-thinking Americans really need advertising to know what supplies we need?)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOlympics, look how desperate Japan is trying to keep it going.  Olympics is the largest media event in the digital media industry, if it falls, then everything else goes in that sector.  Digital Media isn't the only industry that will crash and burn, this is just explaining how a virus outbreak leads to social gatherings being canceled that adversely affects companies whose existence relies on consumers being told what to do with their money and time and consumers quickly are unable to do so as a virus infects and kills them\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; These are my favorite letters of the alphabet\n\nT 28p 4/17\n\nDIS 70p 5/15\n\nVIAC 10p 06/19\n\nMDP 15p 06/19\n\nCMCSA 22.5p 10/16\n\nHonestly, I hope I'm wrong about all of this. shit is terrifying", "created_utc": 1584214341.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fio189/aspiring_autist_says_buy_puts_on_media_companies/", "is_self": true}
