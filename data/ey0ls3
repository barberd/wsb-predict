{"id": "ey0ls3", "title": "Maximize your China profits", "selftext": "China opened up their market and their SSE and A50 indeces dropped 8%. Hard drop. Won\u2019t drop further down cause the gov wont let them sell, and it sure as hell aint gonna go up cause nobody in their right mind will buy shit when they\u2019ll stay quarantined till the 10th. I hope you all put in YANG, FXI, EWT plays. \n\nHere\u2019s the play. SSE and A50 dropped 8%. Yang should open tomorrow at +24%. FXI at -8%. MASSIVE GAINS. If your options are ITM, don\u2019t leave them there. Cash them, and buy OTM, same DTE. Your return will be higher because delta will compound much faster with multiple OTM options compared to a single ITM option. Having two or three OTM options compounding a delta of .6 gives you a much higher ROI than one ITM option with a delta of 1. Pop an addy and think about it until it makes sense.\n\nIf on Tuesday they experience the same drop and your option lands ITM again, keep doing this shit. If you\u2019re gonna profit, optimize that shit.\n\nTldr; if your option opens deep ITM tomorrow morning, cash out and spend that money on OTM, same DTE options. Higher ROI.", "created_utc": 1580700489, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ey0ls3/maximize_your_china_profits/", "is_self": true}
