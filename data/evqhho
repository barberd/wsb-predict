I work hand in hand with FB on a daily basis and have a live view of CPMs and ad space available. This past quarter was the most expensive we've ever seen in a huge way. \n\nTo give you some perspective on this, CPMs (cost per million impressions) for a lot of my clients generally range from 12-22 dollars for crowded eComm spaces. During the holiday season, this will go up to \\~$30-35 because of obvious reasons (inventory/space available).\n\nThis past Q4, I've seen CPMs consistently hit \\~$45-50. This means:\n\n1. There a shit ton of people advertising on Facebook\n2. Said shit ton are spending a lot of money\n3. Facebook's conversion levels are higher than normal, justifying this increased price\n\nI have no idea how this will affect the stock price, but I do know that Facebook has made A LOT of revenue in Q4. Do with this information what you may.\n\nI just sold a 222.5/220 Credit Put Spread 1/31 through earnings.
