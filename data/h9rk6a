BUT I've survived the market starting from Feb. till now. Off my initial investment of 5k, I was at 53k of unrealized gain, but lost most of it but now climbing back up with 16k gain.\n\n\nAnyway, I barely see tips that aren't straight retarded bets or gay boring ass r/investing tips. So I've decided to compile a list that's somewhere in the middle but mostly safer retarded betting:\n\n\n1. Buy options 2 or more weeks out unless you are super confident in a move. Then, sell same day or 1 or 2 days after. Diamond hands is a meme created by theta gang to help you lose money.\n\n\n2. FFS learn the basics. All you really need to know is theta, IV, and bid-ask (plus obviously how options work). Get familiar at what a high theta and high IV looks like relative to each ticker. The rest of it is for nerds\n\n\n3. Sell half-to-all contracts at open if you're profitable. You're up 50% at open but u want to be up 150%? Boo-fucking-hoo you dumb fuck, sell while you're still up and reroll your profits if you're confident in a move.\n\n\n4. Don't follow the fucking memes in here. Kang gang? Tf? Stonks only go up? 80% of the time yes. C'mon you dumb fucks, you really gonna meme your money away? Have fun laughing at some memes but don't fucking use it as actual financial advice you idiot\n\n\n5. Pick 1-5 tickers that you REALLY pay attention to day-to-day and stop chasing 10 baggers on some random fucking stock of a company you've never heard of. 90% of the time you're already too fucking late and IV IS TOO FUCKING HIGH TO DO PUTS ON IT AS WELL YOU FUCKING IDIOT\n\n\n6. Don't subscribe to one side. Bull/bear is literally just MMs taking advantage of how retarded you are. Go with the fucking trend of the market you dumb bitch. GENERALLY stocks go up like 80% of the time BUT drops are quicker. Gotta be on your toes.\n\n\n7. Don't fucking hold if you wouldn't buy in at the current price.\n\n\n8. DON'T BUY 0DTEs UNLESS YOU ARE WILLING TO LOSE ALL OF IT. LIKE REALLY FUCKING WILLING.\n\n\nI'm sure I forgot some shit, but there it is. A way to gamble somewhat safely. So it's fun + you make gains.", "created_utc": 1592263872.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h9rk6a/wsb_tips_tricks_from_a_fellow_autist/", "is_self": true}
