Bought $154 worth of SPY puts on Feb 24th and then just kept buying SPY puts ever since. Weekly and monthlies. Too many positions to list them all. All time is messed up from the 3/2 RH outage due to a SPY option expiration and it getting exercised and then reversed. Feel free to ask any questions. Super grateful for the gains after being down so much all time.", "created_utc": 1584046207.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhnclg/390_to_32000_in_less_than_a_month/", "is_self": true}
