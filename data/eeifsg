{"id": "eeifsg", "title": "Short ideas for 2020", "selftext": "Figured I would share 6 shorts I like in 2020. \n\nPTON- Massive trash, likely fades like the many other fitness fads. Timely IPO thinking short late Jan, looking for $15-$20 range. \n\nNFLX- Decelerating growth in US (richest customer), price cuts in India with an earnings yield of 1% seems like trouble for longs. 6 months and millions to produce content people watch in 3 days is painful for balance sheet that has $12 billion in debt. Think there\u2019s a chance this never sees highs again. Could easily get cut in half from here. \n\nNIO- this has no shot. \n\nTSLA- Won\u2019t try time this short term, stock valuation is completely disconnected from the underlying business and upward trend in price just reinforces bad investing by longs. Think 2020 growth takes a bit of a hit, thinking stock could start to trade in correlation with business performance in 2020, if so $220s almost certain. \n\nBYND- fake meat market is 1% of total meat market. I won\u2019t argue the trend in plant based eating but the business has a ton of work and time to grow into current valuation. Lots of bag holders overhead thinking $35 is likely in 2020. \n\nMAT- Deteriorating business with terrible management integrity. Business isn\u2019t worth the debt and potential legal liabilities ahead. Think this should get cut in half from here.\n\nHappy trading,\n-Augury", "created_utc": 1577093445, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eeifsg/short_ideas_for_2020/", "is_self": true}
