{"id": "f2n129", "title": "SoftBank is taking the wrong approach toward developing AI", "selftext": "As Elliott Management also suggested, Masayoshi Son's current \"vision fund\" strategy to develop AI is not the best way to do so. Son has been believing in \"group strategy\" or \"\u90e1\u6226\u7565\" in which he invests in the best companies in their fields, e.g. ARM, Boston Dynamics, Uber, WeWork, etc. believing that their synergy surrounding AI will lead to the AI revolution, giving up doing the fundamental R&amp;D research himself. Skimming through SoftBank's annual report 2019, R&amp;D was mentioned only in ARM's section. I believe SoftBank needs to invest more in fundamental research to become a true leader in AI and the information revolution.  \n\n\nReference:   \n[https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/02/11/business/corporate-business/paul-singer-masayoshi-son-softbank-investor/#.XkNo4RMzaSM](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/02/11/business/corporate-business/paul-singer-masayoshi-son-softbank-investor/#.XkNo4RMzaSM)  \n\n\n[https://cdn.group.softbank/en/corp/set/data/irinfo/financials/annual\\_reports/pdf/2019/sbg\\_annual\\_report\\_2019\\_001.pdf](https://cdn.group.softbank/en/corp/set/data/irinfo/financials/annual_reports/pdf/2019/sbg_annual_report_2019_001.pdf)  \n\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9lnsN6qy3Y&amp;t=1743s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9lnsN6qy3Y&amp;t=1743s)", "created_utc": 1581489405, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f2n129/softbank_is_taking_the_wrong_approach_toward/", "is_self": true}
