C19 Volatility Trading Strategy - Looking for Feedback", "selftext": "For obvious reasons, all of the Virus stocks - aka treatments, vaccines and testing companies are experiencing insane volatility.  It's nearly impossible to catch them before they get the terror run up. \n\nTherefore there is literally no way I can time an entry into one of these or predict which vaccine will be successful. BUT...\n\nI am noticing a trend that after some major movers get their short term insane bumps, there is an inevitable dump after everyone has been rushes in on the FOMO.  My thought is ill never catch the run up, but I can catch the short play or the put option play on the way down.\n\nA few examples, among many are ... \n\n**$DVAX**, May 19th run up $6.51 May 27 dump to $4.75\n\n**$SRNE**, May 18th $8.82, June 1 slow dump to $4.98\n\n**$HARP**, May 29th run up $21.99, June 1 slow dump $18.28\n\nThe list goes on and on, just watch the top movers on a daily basis and you'll spot one this week. The Gap/trend seems evident.  \n\nI tried this strategy on some non-virus stocks **$ACB** and **$TGI** with small wins - but looking for feedback or ideas regarding this trading strategy.  Doing quick DD helped me narrow down the \"fake\" winners.\n\nI do not own the rights to this site and am not affiliated in anyway, but found this to also be a very effective and valuable resource when thinking about entry/exit timing: [https://vac-lshtm.shinyapps.io/ncov\\_vaccine\\_landscape/](https://vac-lshtm.shinyapps.io/ncov_vaccine_landscape/)\n\nTL;DR\n\nShort major movers that get anomalous spikes for no apparent reason or on the fake news, see examples above.
