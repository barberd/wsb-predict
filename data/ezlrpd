Think about it, multiple cities the size of NYC are basically on complete lockdown. Only an authoritarian China can do this while it may go on to spread uncontrollably everywhere else, especially in India and south east Asia which don\u2019t have any where close to the infrastructure or government power. Maybe this is part of a bigger plan for China to destabilize its weaker neighbors so China can establish hegemony in the Asia pacific. This seems quite bullish for China. \n\nAnyway I bought calls on MCHI they seem dirt cheap.", "created_utc": 1580958443, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ezlrpd/why_you_should_buy_call_options_on_chinese_stocks/", "is_self": true}
