{"id": "cfcvus", "title": "Okay please listen", "selftext": "Last week, I talked about Google and some people downvoted me. Now I don't like getting downvoted so I did some DD and figure out it would be going to at $1200 by October. I then received an email for a warehouse. It's for a job opportunity that pays 22/hr driving a forklift. Now Google contracts are expensive so I replied back and got a call from them. I got an interview on Tuesday even though I am in an accounting internship (pay is shit tho, 15/hr). I spent 5 hrs learning about Google and it's projects underway. I am now definitely go to switch jobs just to afford the premiums.\n\nLast night, I had a dream. I was going to a synagogue late at night due to a hurricane (I live in Toronto and I am not Jewish) and suddenly me and my mom saw aliens. Now these aliens look like this \ud83d\udc19 and we couldn't hear what they were saying. I pulled out my Google pixel phone and used Google cloud to translate what they were saying. I was totally shocked how underrated Google is. They legit had a technology that translated aliens. No wonder it is called Google cloud. Google cloud aims to translate Martian speak to humans when we eventually colonize Mars. I was entirely focused on appreciating Google that I didn't know what was going on in my dream.\n\nNow the story gets boring as I fall in love with Lana Rhoades who saved me from being abducted by a homeless dude. I was sadly woke up and decided to wake up my mom beside me up to explain what I just experienced. She told me share the blanket and seemed uninterested but I know, I fucking know that wasn't a coincidence. Google developed main controlling technology. Please please everyone atleast buy $Googl at 160 till August. It's legit free money.", "created_utc": 1563568945, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cfcvus/okay_please_listen/", "is_self": true}
