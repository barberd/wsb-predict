{"id": "gzm5y9", "title": "PRPL 8-K Sales Release!", "selftext": "Purple just released an intermediate [8-K business update for June](https://investors.purple.com/press-releases/news-details/2020/Purple-Innovation-Provides-Business-Update-Ahead-of-Participation-in-Oppenheimer-20th-Annual-Consumer-Growth-Conference/default.aspx), ahead of announcing that they will present at the Oppenheimer Growth Conference on June 16-17 (expect more info disclosure on this date, so another potential bump).\n\nYou may recall that [I posted here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gqpqa3/prpl_to_19_by_812_er_calling_it_again/) an expected sales range of $184.9M-$199.9M for Q2.\n\nPurple has now disclosed $71M in DTC sales and $17.3M in Wholesale sales.\n\nOur quarter so far, looks like this:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n||DTC Sales|Wholesale Sales|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|April|$54.0M|$2.7M\\*|\n|May|$71.0M|$17.3M|\n|Totals|125.0M|$20.0M|\n\n\\*My very conservative estimate for April.   An actual was not disclosed, but a 43% YoY sales drop was.   Of the $39.3M in wholesale sales in Q2 2019, I assume $17.3M for May 2019 (which was disclosed today) and $17.3M for June 2019 (which is likely high), leaving only $4.7M for April 2019.   A 43% decrease off of that would be $2.7M.\n\n***THIS MEANS PRPL HAS ALREADY HIT $145M IN NET ORDER REVENUE FOR Q2!!!***\n\nIf we assume that PRPL hits net orders for June somewhere between the April (which was only accelerated for half the month per Q1 the earnings release) and May (released today), ***we should expect to see net order revenue between $201.7M and $233.3M for the quarter***!\n\nThis completely blows out the high side of my estimates from earlier.\n\nExpect some significant positive price action on PRPL today.   Also, we will likely see some additional price action around the Oppenheimer 20th Annual Consumer Growth Conference on June 16 -17, 2020.\n\nPlace your bets accordingly.  Congrats to those who already invested.\n\nI'm long PRPL via PRPLW warrants and this should not be construed as investment advice.", "created_utc": 1591705685.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gzm5y9/prpl_8k_sales_release/", "is_self": true}
