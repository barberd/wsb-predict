{"id": "gekla8", "title": "SNAP is worth 100-300M at best.", "selftext": "I've been thinking really hard for about 10 or 15 min and i've come to the conclusion that SNAP may be (is) the most overvalued tech stock out there. I wouldn't even refer to SNAP as a company, they have one product, that is an old trend app with no apparent sign of having any other successful projects. I really absolutely can't understand who the fuck is paying 25B + for that company. It's pretty incredible how much they can't turn their datas into any actual money, i'll give them that for sure.  That being said, i'm pretty lazy right now so i'll pointform the rest. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Cons:\n\n\\-Really misunderstood by their boomer investors: Snap still sell the dream about them becoming a powerhouse in communication and the next generation chat tools. It's not, and never will. It's a tool used to send nudes (and who the fuck check ads while they are sexting) , and now that instagram have disappearing messages (for quite some time), the snap crowd isn't actually growing. *(I bet most of they're new users are unrelevant from people tired of their /girlfriendboyfriend/ in the quarantine and wanted to chat in secrets = zero real data value. or by kids who'll convert to tik tok soon )*\n\n\\-Way to hyped by the new investors who put all their 1200 stimulus into SNAP, SPCE or TSLA. (from all those bad ideas, snap is the worst.)\n\n\\-They are not making any money. If they can't monetize that much user, how many will they need to make a profit? The app is getting old and the trend is moving fast to tik tok. I still have a Snapchat account, and it used to have a massive amount of stories from friends, nowadays, I see 2-3-4 stories from friend per day. While Instagram stories are everywhere and growing. \n\n*-* It's a *trend app*, it's cyclic. instagram and facebook are like the backgrounds apps but everything on tops are cyclics most of the times. I think people overvalued this massively by the hope it will be a next Instagram or Facebook, wich is now proven that it is not the case. \n\n\\-The CEO is cocky, overpaid and take every chances he get to sells his stonks. He made a big move when he first built that company, but now, he absolutely have no clue about what he's doing and is the master at cash burning, and buying lambo's with company money.  \n\n\\-Their \"tech\" isn't special anymore\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Pros: \n\nGood thing is, I don't think snap is worth 0$ :).If the economy is doing great, i would still value the company at a couple hundred millions. So maybe, i'll buy some under 1$ ! \n\nI can't see how they can be valued at more than 100-300M, and even then, the only value I see might be: **the team, some real time 3D rendering they have, and the app if it's part of a larger project portfolio, from a company who already have a major advertising infrastructures and knowledges.**", "created_utc": 1588773807.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gekla8/snap_is_worth_100300m_at_best/", "is_self": true}
