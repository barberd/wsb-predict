{"id": "e62gxq", "title": "PTON update", "selftext": "About 59% of the float is currently short with a borrow rate of about 7%. Stock came down from $37 to about $31.90 as of this update. I am still long. I haven\u2019t taken any calls off the table. Ihor at S3 posted that he thinks a short squeeze could be on the table soon, but he said it\u2019s just a feeling (follow him on Twitter- he\u2019s bright). \n\nWhether you think the ad they put out was offensive or not, we can all agree it was stupid and probably didn\u2019t help them win any more customers. I still expect a rise to the high $40\u2019s or low $50\u2019s and this down period doesn\u2019t really negate my thesis as of yet. I just looked at my BYND chart as it ran up from $80 (when I bought calls and posted on WSB) to $240 and it had several serious drawdowns ($190 to $138, etc) on the way up. Just my two cents. My $35 strike calls expire Jan 17th. \n\nIdeally we should be seeing the amount of available shares to short falling at brokers. At IB it was 1.9m shares available a week ago, then 1.2m towards the end of last week, and I believe was 580k or so yesterday. Anyone have an updated figure on that from today?\n\nGood luck to all", "created_utc": 1575480111, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e62gxq/pton_update/", "is_self": true}
