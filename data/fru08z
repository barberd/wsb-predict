I AM NOT FUCKING SELLING.\nI went from 2k to 40k (will post all gains when cash out, until then are all just paper money). Then Friday  after the gap down, at market open I bought 20k$ $SPY Put 15/5 230. Efficient market my balls. This shit is not free market, this is efficient only for my ass that is spreading big. I came to the conclusion, I don\u2019t give a shit I will ride those puts to the end. Not buying this run, I will either be happy with some gains or I will be fucking disgusted this shit priced all the 23th of March.. I will take the full load of JP I don\u2019t give a fuck no more. I want to believe that this is only a correction before the market retake a turn otherwise I studied for nothing because this shit is more rigged than casinos. JP GO SUCK MY TINY DICK (and my remaining 14k of the position) YOU PIECE OF SHIT. \nSincerely,\nThe gayest of all the gays \ud83d\udd95\ud83c\udffd", "created_utc": 1585585841.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fru08z/you_know_what/", "is_self": true}
