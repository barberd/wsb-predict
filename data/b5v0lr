{"id": "b5v0lr", "title": "The case for $NIO and why you should at least consider it\u2019s time.", "selftext": "\nMany of you degenerates, queers, and fags probably think or were told to think that $NIO is a scam, a sham, a fucking fugazi. That\u2019s ok.  Yet with the stock down ~47.34 % in not even a month I want to make a buy case for NIO.  Why?  Because the company sells fucking EV\u2019s you twat and in the thousands, its backed by Tencent, Baidu, and JAC motors (the chink version of (( THEY ))), but not only that the market cap of $NIO is currently at 4.14B.  The market cap is not even much higher than fucking $CRON at 3.67B and nowhere near as highly valued as $CGC at a dam 14.80B market cap.  People are literally valuing companies like $CRON which had gross sales of C$5.6 million nearly as much as fucking $NIO [1].  \n\nI want to get over this hump that NIO isn\u2019t a company that sells EV\u2019s well.  In the third quarter NIO delivered 3,268 units of the ES8 which is an electric premium SUV [2]. In the fourth quarter NIO delivered even more electric vehicles with 7,980 ES8 deliveries to customers, putting the company over 10,000 deliveries for the year [3].  Yes the company had losses in the third and fourth quarter and guess what?  WHAT FUCKING EV COMPANY DOESN\u2019T HAVE LOSES. The EV market is a loss selling growth sector as it has always been.  Don\u2019t let losses scare you away from NIO.\n\nYes they canceled plans to develop a factory in Shanghai.  Let me tell you why this isn\u2019t a bad thing at all.  Tesla is building a factory in Shanghai currently and you might say \u201cTesla wen\u2019t open source on their patents blah blah blah\u201d, but patents aren\u2019t the full story.  Tesla has trade secrets some of which have already been stolen by the chinese and sold to chinese companies. Such as in the case with Xpeng Motors [4]. Tesla\u2019s factory will not only provide the means for the chinese to infiltrate and sell off more confidential information on Tesla but the production factory setup, workforce, etc can provide invaluable information for $NIO on building their own factory in the future.\n\nNow is not the time to brush off $NIO and I do say now is the best time to start adleat adding it on your watchlist.  Yes the stock can go to 4 dollars flat and hell maybe three dollars but as I suggested before the market cap isn\u2019t huge and the company sells evs and has room to grow in the future.  I think we should end off with nearly all of r/investing convinced $NIO is  scam which is enough to convince me to pay attention to it because fuck personal finance and investing.\n\n\n\n\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/pot-maker-cronos-group-losses-widen-but-recreational-sales-remain-a-mystery-2019-03-26\nhttps://www.investors.com/news/nio-earnings-es8-production-tesla/\nhttps://www.fool.com/investing/2019/03/06/chinese-tesla-rival-nio-2018-was-good-2019-will-be.aspx\nhttps://www.autonews.com/automakers-suppliers/tesla-chinas-xpeng-motors-face-over-trade-secrets\n", "created_utc": 1553633080, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b5v0lr/the_case_for_nio_and_why_you_should_at_least/", "is_self": true}
