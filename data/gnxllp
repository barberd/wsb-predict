{"id": "gnxllp", "title": "Undervalued COVID-19 Vaccine Player - Serious DD", "selftext": "Hi autists,\n\nI wanted to post this last week already when DVAX was trading between $3.90 and $4.80 and when I entered my trade, sadly I wasn't able to because Reddit Karma seems to be an issue in doing so & mods must literally hate money, let's hope this one goes through though.\n\nI'm sure you've all seen the various vaccine and other COVID-19-related moonshots and I'm going to present to you the next *solid* one: DVAX (Dynavax)\n\nIn various ways it's comparable to NVAX, which had a year low of $3,52 and closed at $52.81 yesterday. You can't exactly compare them 1:1 though. While NVAX is aiming at succeeding both in the active vaccine ingredient (NVX-CoV2373) & adjuvant ( Matrix-M\u2122) neither of which have been approved by the FDA so far, **DVAX is only focusing on it's already FDA approved adjuvant** called CpG-1018, which is used in their FDA approved Hepatitis-B vaccine and is listed on the CDC website as a novel adjuvant that's using a synthetic form of DNA that mimics bacterial and viral genetic material ([https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/adjuvants.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/adjuvants.html)).\n\nAn adjuvant is used to induce a stronger antibody response in a vaccinated person, the CDC puts it the following way:\n\n>An adjuvant is an ingredient used in some vaccines that helps create a stronger immune response in people receiving the vaccine. In other words, adjuvants help vaccines work better. Some vaccines that are made from weakened or killed germs contain naturally occurring adjuvants and help the body produce a strong protective immune response. However, most  vaccines developed today include just small components of germs, such as their proteins, rather than the entire virus or bacteria. Adjuvants help the body to produce an immune response strong enough to protect the person from the disease he or she is being vaccinated against.\n\nCOVID-19 is most fatal among older and immunocompromised people. Now check out DVAX's findings of their already approved adjuvant ([https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308944635\\_Development\\_of\\_the\\_CpG\\_Adjuvant\\_1018\\_A\\_Case\\_Study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308944635_Development_of_the_CpG_Adjuvant_1018_A_Case_Study))\n\n>Development of the CpG Adjuvant 1018: A Case Study  \n>  \n>Preclinical testing of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) + 1018 in comparison to HBsAg + alum demonstrated induction of substantially higher antibody titers and a **favorable safety profile for 1018**. Most importantly, clinical studies with HBsAg vaccination consistently demonstrate **more rapid induction of protective antibody titers with 1018** compared to alum in all populations studied, **including groups that are harder to immunize such as the elderly and immunocompromised individuals**.\n\nNow you may ask yourself, well nice but what is it good without a vaccine? Let me tell you: Partnerships & Royalties\n\nBut first let's get the following out of the way: there are almost 8 billion people on earth, there's not a single company that will be able to meet the demand this patient population requires.\n\nDVAX has so far entered into the following partnerships (note the insanely tight schedule - all within less than a month indicating great interest from big names & gov):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uxf45jdi74051.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a16f24e33cc0b89e4a969285160df58347be1d2\n\nThe University of Queensland is missing on that screenshot, too (March 2nd).\n\n**Sinovac (Beijing, China)**: **Major Chinese Player** Created H1N1 (swine flu) and H5N1 (bird flu) vaccines leading entity in China for COVID-19 vaccine\n\n**Clover (Chengdu, China)**:  Clover Successfully Produced 2019-nCoV Subunit Vaccine Candidate and  Detected Cross-Reacting Antibodies from Sera of Multiple Infected  Patients \n\n**Valneva (France)**: Successfuly developped Dukoral, a vaccine against cholera \n\n**University of Queensland (Australia):**  Funded by the Australian Government (brrrrr money)\n\nThe University of Queensland\u2019s potential COVID-19 vaccine is entering an important new phase of testing with the live coronavirus to determine how effectively it induces protection against coronavirus infection.\n\n**CEPI (Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation):** Recently provided $388m of funding to NVAX, which caused a big 100% moonshot *after a 500% rally* (check May 11th). DVAX next?\n\nIn the beginning of the year DVAX was trading between $5-7 and is now trading in the mid 5s. In the beginning of the year all the COVID-19 valuation was missing and DVAX was already then considered undervalued. DVAX is now undervalued in every imaginable aspect.\n\nOn Monday they've announced that one or more of their partners will start phase 1 trials using their adjuvant in July 2020, the stock went from around $4.50 to $7 and has now retraced to mid 5s. On Tuesday the volume was approx. 40 million shares, of which 60% was shorted.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the news there was way above average volume in shares, meaning funds have loaded this stock on upwards momentum (it's what made me buy in the first place) and they're not in it to sell out at +30%. This will naturally take a similar path that NVAX has taken and my body is ready to feel that lambo acceleration.\n\nThere's a short-term caveat: In case CEPI announces funding for DVAX, this likely shoots 100-200% causing a short squeeze but there's no guarantee of that happening, but it must be considerd while evaluating your strategies.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t4mh6cv9d4051.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e6d8d27a1207dd51facc24b84fbc245f44e9f13\n\nAt this point short term options seem risky because the IV has gone through the roof. July or October 2020 calls might be better but personally I wouldn't buy options at this point and just go straight for the stock, or maybe allocate a smaller portion to options and a bigger to shares.\n\nAnd some advice: in case you're retarded like me and hold your options, make sure to roll them over to later expiries during high volatility days for maximum mid-term gainz.\n\nNote: this is not a solicitation to buy shit, you can't sue me for your mental retardation\n\nGodspeed", "created_utc": 1590070457.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gnxllp/undervalued_covid19_vaccine_player_serious_dd/", "is_self": true}
