It's cronyism if it continues. But it will continue.\n\nThe fundamentals put S&P 500 around 200 per Goldman previously and they've since revised because of BRRRR.  But maybe if liberals in America hadn't spent 4 years non-stop scheming against Trump and also if half of America weren't prone to being manipulated by a higher IQ and dubious mainstream media everyone would have let the market correct instead of what is now occurring.\n\n**This is not preventing a depression, this is exacerbating the risk of a super depression event.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**JPM:**  Top analyst line go up, mid-level analyst line go down.
