{"id": "dtc85m", "title": "Huge DD regarding Mexico this week", "selftext": "Okay guys listen, so I was on my moms iPad today to watch some fortknight videos on YouTube and at the beginning of the video some guy who looked smart came on and said about stocks and some watch list that he sends and something and I think his name was something like Tim Sykes or Syke nibba or something and he said that he made 12 dollars into 5 million so it sounds like he knows what he's doing. So after that first guys video Pitbull came on the iPad and said something about some product but then I thought to myself and asked what language does Pitbull sing in? Since he songs in Mexican and before him was this stock guy I think something big might be happening with Mexico this next week so I think we should either buy puts or calls.\n\nOk I have to go now because my mom said I'm not allowed to use the iPad after 8pm", "created_utc": 1573199809, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dtc85m/huge_dd_regarding_mexico_this_week/", "is_self": true}
