Any comments or suggestions are appreciated.\n\n***Ticker : ZNGA***\n\nSpot Price : $ 9.72\n\nCompany Summary : Zynga Inc. (\u201cZynga\u201d or \u201cwe\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) is a leading provider of social game services. We develop, market and operate social games as live services played on mobile platforms, such as Apple\u2019s iOS and Google\u2019s Android, and social networking platforms, such as Facebook and Snapchat. Generally, all of our games are free to play, and we generate substantially all of our revenue through the sale of in-game virtual items (\u201conline game revenue\u201d) and advertising services (\u201cadvertising revenue\u201d).\n\nWe have been a pioneer in social gaming and in making \u201cplay\u201d a core activity on mobile devices and social networking platforms. We believe our leadership position in social games is the result of our significant investment in our people, content, brand, technology and infrastructure.\u00a0\n\n10k Link : [https://investor.zynga.com/node/14956/html](https://investor.zynga.com/node/14956/html)\n\nSpecial Considerations : 52 wk high\n\nNext Earnings Date: 7/30/2020\n\nLast Earnings Date : 05/06/2020\n\nDividEnd Date : None\n\nOption Information :\n\nToday\u2019s Option Volume : 141,039  Average Daily Volume : 38,476 Multiple over ADV : 4\n\nTotal Calls : 127,927 | Total Puts : 13,112 | C/P Ratio : 9.75648261\n\nCalls at ask % : 35.8%  Calls at bid % : 38.8%\n\nPuts at ask % :  25.9% Puts at bid % : 35.5%\n\nNotable OI Changes strikes :\n\nZNGA  7/17/20  9  C  31572  29942\n\nZNGA  7/17/20  8  C  20502  19433\n\n\u00b7  Note OI is only updated in the AM.\n\nLargest Strike traded for the day :\n\nZNGA 01/21/22 12C @ 1.55, 3.8k VLM\n\nImpression : Mobile Gaming continues to be a hot industry due to CoVID-19. ZNGA also recently  announced a deal to acquire Turkish game company Peak for 1.8 billion. Usually the acquiring company drops during acquisitions. Call to put ratio is greater than 9x, with 4x ADV. This certainly looks like it has more room to run up. Suggest buying bull puts or stock out right for a short term hold over the next few days.\n\n***Ticker : AZN***\n\nSpot Price : $ 55.20\n\nSector: Biopharm\n\nCompany Summary : Biopharmaceutical which focuses on Oncology, Cardiovascular, Renal, Respiratory therapies. The company currently has 38 projects in Phase I, 43 projects in phase II, and 22 projects in late stage development / phase III.\n\n20F Link : [https://www.astrazeneca.com/content/dam/az/Investor\\_Relations/annual-report-2019/pdf/AstraZeneca\\_AR\\_2019.pdf](https://www.astrazeneca.com/content/dam/az/Investor_Relations/annual-report-2019/pdf/AstraZeneca_AR_2019.pdf)\n\nSpecial Considerations : None\n\nNext Earnings Date: 7/30/2020\n\nLast Earnings Date : 04/29/2020\n\nDividEnd Date : 08/06/2020\n\nOption Information :\n\nToday\u2019s Option Volume : 77,612  Average Daily Volume : 13,877  Multiple over ADV : 6\n\nTotal Calls : 75,224  Total Puts : 2,388  C/P Ratio : 31.51\n\nCalls at ask % : 40.20% Calls at bid % : 39.80%  Puts at ask % : 31.80%.

Lynparza got approval for pancreatic cancer. Likely some CoVID-19 miracle drug hope mixed in as well with the positive news and negative Remdesivir trial. Call to put ratio is 31.5x. This to me looks like it will have a run up. As a rule I don\u2019t play Biomed stocks. If I had to, I\u2019d do buy the 7/17 55C and sell the 60C with a TP.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Ticker : FLEX***\n\nSpot Price : $10.23\n\nCompany Summary : We are a globally-recognized, provider of *Sketch-to-Scale*\u00ae services\u2014innovative design, engineering, manufacturing, and supply chain services and solutions\u2014from conceptual sketchto full-scale production.

This stocks trading at over 50x daily option volume with a C/P of 20.7x. I can\u2019t find any news on this stock to motivate the call buying. This looks trade looks clean to me. I will buy some stock of this tomorrow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonorable Mention : DKNG still continued to outperform today. Call to put ratio is 3.1x with call bid/ask being about even at 33%. Put ask has now increased to 49%. It does appear there is an expectation of drop in the near future.", "created_utc": 1591046762.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gutfes/unusual_option_activity_for_06012020/", "is_self": true}
