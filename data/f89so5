IT'S BAD. \n\nDuring the weekend the reported cases of coronavirus have skyrocketed to more than 130 infected, with 2 deaths. We are now the 5th country by total infected or something like that. We were nowhere near this number a few weeks ago, and it won't stop spreading beacuase the people that were infected have been running around in hospitals and workplaces without any knowledge for the past two weeks. I live near one of the places where this stuff started in the Veneto and Lombardia region, my mother works in the sanitary services and let me tell you: shit is hitting the fan.\n\nThe goverment has issued a decree to close down schools, commercial activities, roads ... you get the point.\n\nWhen market opens tomorrow FTSE MIB will probably tank down. And no, since I've heard people talking about it: Ferrari's main headquarters is an another region so for the very short term future they won't be affected. But pretty much all the productive stuff of the country is in the North, where the virus is spreading fast.", "created_utc": 1582466521, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f89so5/almost_nobody_in_this_sub_is_talking_about_italy/", "is_self": true}
