{"id": "bi5gxd", "title": "DIS to150 on a postive earnings or ban me", "selftext": "Disney opened at $78 5 years ago. Febuary 1st it closed at $111. That's about 6% gain per year for five years.\n\nDisney's yearly revenue was reported at 52.27B  for 2015. q4 of 2018 was 15.303B. Without increasing revenue from DIS+, and the 6 HUGE record breaking blockbusters they're releasing that means they'd average 61.212. Or an increase of 17.1%. That's not factoring in the huge increases in revenue they'll see off their streaming service and films.\n\nYear over year they increase by ~5.7% for their revenue.\n\nDisney's yearly operating expeses repoprted at 41.43B in 2015. q4 of 2018 was 11.885B which averages out to 47.56B. Seeing as how Disney is pretty much done aquiring IP and has what it want's it's a good guess to say operating expenses may have peaked for the fiscal year. That's a 14% increase in operating costs\n\nYear over year thats a ~4.6% increase for their expenses, *However* a significant amount of the expenses were in aquiring new IP and investing in itself. \n\nOver the past 5 years examples of them investing in itself would be: 3 new cruise ships cost 1.25B, Shanghai Disneyland cost 5.5B, 1.4B on Hong Kong Disneyland expansion, BAM 2.58B, Avatar Worl 500m, and a litenany of smaller investments.\n\nRevenue was 9.199b in 2015 and is up to ~12.598b in 2018 or about ~37%.\n\n37% increase in revenue over 3 years means it went up over 12% /year the last 3, yet only gained half that in share price. P/E has been falling for 5 years guys. If we look back at the P/E 5 years ago we're not even at that point yet. Earnings is going to show just how undervalued this stock is. Even if Q1 misses, the revenue is there. Buy Calls later than november. DIS+ and Star wars both come out around then. Disney at a minimum is going to increase to ~160 over the next year and that's not even including the added revenue that's going to happen this year. Fuck a high IV, leaps are where it's at on DIsney.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-disney-port-protest-20180927-story.html\n\nhttps://skift.com/2019/02/06/disney-doesnt-plan-to-spend-a-fortune-promoting-new-star-wars-att\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_Story_Land\n\nhttps://disneynews.us/important-disney-acquisitions-time-disney-history/", "created_utc": 1556410719, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bi5gxd/dis_to150_on_a_postive_earnings_or_ban_me/", "is_self": true}
