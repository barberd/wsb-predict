{"id": "fcerfn", "title": "Lets create a WSB trading platform to replace Robinhood", "selftext": "Its pretty obvious that Robinhood is just a couple of dudes jacking off in a hut.  Similar to cavemen discovering fire, I can only assume they -released- all over their keyboards are accidentally coded a trading platform.  Thus the birth (heh, pun) of Robinhood.  \n\nIf these people can do it so can we.  Lets devise a plan to make our own trading platform. \n\nOur \"So what\" factor for our app will be:\n\n\\-Infinite leverage (obviously)\n\n\\-WSB Terminology for simplicity purposes. \n\n\\-For example, a \"Buy YOLO FD's\" button to put 100% of your portfolio into FD's with the click of a button.  \n\n\\-A self-identified \"Bear, Bull, Theta Gang\" so when you click the above \"Buy YOLO FD's\" button it already knows that you want to either buy call/put fd's or simply sell options.  \n\n\\-Everytime you make money on a trade it automatically withdraws 10$ from your account and orders uber eats chicken tenders to your house.  \n\n\\-Everytime you lose money on a trade, the app just calls you autistic, a moron, etc for a set amount of time.  It will be in levels so like 100K plus loss is \"Supreme autist\" and 100$-1000 loss is \"Could be worse, but youre still dumb\".  If you exploit the app in a special way, or make an especially retarded play, you will earn a title of the developers choosing to brag about on the other features I will be discussing.  \n\n\\-Obviously there will be a leaderboard for \"Best and worst plays of the week/all time\" etc for both biggest percent gain/loss and biggest dollar gain/loss.  As well, occasional articles of WSB Trading platform where we interview and publish articles doing literally nothing but making fun of some moron that made a really autistic play and how it turned out, where good or bad.  These titles will display on the leaderboards, and so forth.\n\n\\-Similar to Robinhoods awful news article thing that they have, so will WSB trading platform, but its will make everything sound like a sure thing.  It will say \"This is free money, cant go tits up\" when in reality, it is very likely to go tits up.  \n\n\\-There will be a daily/weekly/yearly update on how much money bear, bull, and theta gang repectively have made, and thus can make fun of them.  \n\nThis could go on for much longer, but im tired of typing now, so lets hear what other great idea's you all have, and anyone who knows how to jizz on a keyboard and birth a trading platform comment and lets see if we cant make this happen.  \n\nWhatever literal coding nightmare we come up with HAS to be better, or at least on par with, whatever Robinhood comes up with.", "created_utc": 1583167207, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fcerfn/lets_create_a_wsb_trading_platform_to_replace/", "is_self": true}
