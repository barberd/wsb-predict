{"id": "ca83u7", "title": "How I Trade Stocks After 12 Years", "selftext": "TL;DR I trade events with a 6-18mo turnaround interval using sector-specific information. About 36% APR since 2009.\n\nBeen doing this since 2007. I\u2019ve started with 3500usd. Lots of survivor bias here, so not a blueprint. Maybe some bits still useful though.\n\nI never expected trading to become a full time activity for me. Initially I bought only straight stocks and tried to put a bit of money behind my own ideas.\n\nCRM, NVDA, ARBA and GHDX were first.\nFor each the investment thesis was around the value of their IP and ability to turn R&amp;D to billable product.\n\nLong, boring play. Once I had the stocks it motivated me enough to paper trade around them and learn to read the tape. \n\nIt\u2019s nice to enter the market in a recession. \n\nEarned enough confidence to start trading on margin. Broker was cheap on fees and suited my early style but margin interest was high (Firstrade).\n\nMade event plays on DELL, VMW, AMD, TRIP and EXP. SMCI later. \n\nThey all had in common one behaviour - a sharp drop after an earnings call or merger announcement which I disagreed with. Bought the stock on convinction and then stayed long. \n\nAll these years I was building a nice professional network, mostly via LinkedIn. Worked in corporate jobs across several sectors, private consulting and launched a few companies. Everywhere, opportunities to meet people among whom genuine experts in a variety of fields.\n\nSince 2017 I was headhunted by expert panels and executive search firms. Little did I know what GLG clients did with my buy-side insights. I count that as a learning, too. Probably took around 100 gigs between them, Guidepoint and Coleman.\n\nMoved most of my trading to Interactive Brokers for their order execution quality. I stopped buying stocks only and finally \u201cgraduated\u201d to options.\n\nI use options in several specific strategies:\n\n- to sweat a position with covered calls\n- to enter a position with protective puts\n- to protect my buying power \n- to protect paper profits with zero dollar collars\n\nMy gray edge is still in the network and synthesising information about what a company does, not what the public reads from statements and transcripts.\n\nI also expanded my method to pharma and diagnostics.\n\nCurrent plays on MYL, TEVA, ACER and TRIB.\n\nStrategy moved to LEAPS thus freeing my buying power. Started recently to add ETFs and most likely moving to futures before the end of the year.\n\nHistorically almost 91% of the times on the right side.\nSince introducing options strategies I have more firepower and I can broaden my selection of stocks so ratio has been declining to about 83% over the past 2mo, but I am trending past 20 symbols in the portfolio besides the end of the year.\n\nThe two things I learned:\n- success depends on information and risk management\n- the best way to test an idea is by taking a position.", "created_utc": 1562513759, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ca83u7/how_i_trade_stocks_after_12_years/", "is_self": true}
