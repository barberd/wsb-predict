The planned coupon would be the lowest for any outstanding  junk fixed-rate note in the world, according to data compiled by  Bloomberg, and [pales](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/PRWSDM6KLVR4) in comparison with rates above 10% on some dollar securities sold by Chinese issuers this year.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;One percent on a junk bond may be unthinkable in other debt  markets, but by Japanese standards it looks pretty good. Two-year local  government debt yields are at about minus 0.16%, and a 50-year yen  corporate bond priced this year at a little over 1%.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The landmark [Aiful offering](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-28/japan-s-first-junk-bond-would-break-down-barriers-in-wary-market)  is the exception that proves the rule in Japan, where companies haven\u2019t  felt compelled to sell speculative-grade notes as they\u2019ve traditionally  found it easy to obtain bank loans. But some recent changes have at  least raised the possibility that the country could eventually develop  such a market. State-run Government Pension Investment Fund, which  manages the world\u2019s largest such pool of assets, revised guidelines last  year to allow it to buy yen bonds with ratings of BB or lower.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;BOJ Effect  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The  milestone of a junk note in Japan is a welcome \u201cbyproduct\u201d of the Bank  of Japan\u2019s negative-interest rate policy which has spurred more risk  taking by investors, but there is a long way to go before the nation has  a functioning high-yield market, according to Toshiyasu Ohashi, Daiwa  Securities Group Inc.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;While many Japanese investors will welcome any extra yield,  some that can buy higher-paying overseas notes will find a coupon of  about 1% to still be too little.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The calculus could be different  for certain other Japanese investors like smaller banks that can\u2019t make  money buying government bonds with negative yields and so must find  alternatives.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Lenders are awash with deposits, and desperate for  investment options as their profitability gets squeezed. The difference  between bank deposits and loans at Japanese banks known as the yotai  gap, widened to a record 256.6 trillion yen ($2.34 trillion) at the end  of April, according to data BOJ data.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Coupon data are based on company bonds currently rated speculative that didn\u2019t have investment grades when issued.", "created_utc": 1559235516, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/buvlbo/first_publicly_offered_junk_bond_in_japan_will/", "is_self": true}
