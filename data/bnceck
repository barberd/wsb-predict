Who to trust, who to invest, who to watch, tips of the trade, whatever to help a beginner! I am using Robinhood for stocks, seeing as that is a popular app among the people around here, and I have 1 SIRI stock which has now dropped to $5.75, anything to do with it since it was a free stock from the app? Thanks, and happy investing?", "created_utc": 1557583475, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bnceck/new_to_the_scene_here_needed_some_help_from_the/", "is_self": true}
