Will the markets just equal the Fed's interest rate decision and how much money they print from now on? It seems that \"There's No Such Thing As Free Lunch\" doesn't apply to the stock market.  \n\nThe entire world economy is in the shitter and the stock market is acting as if there will be 20%+ growth a year for ever. \n\nIs this the death of DD?  Is this why Buffet has been performing so poorly when compared to the S&P 500?\n\n(Also, why does the futures market soar with low volume and tank the moment there is volume?)", "created_utc": 1590419874.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gqcreh/why_is_the_fed_doing_anything_if_this_is_a/", "is_self": true}
