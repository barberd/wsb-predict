I refused to jump in on SPCE because I was 100% sure it would go down yesterday; this was the RATIONAL decision to make. It was a speculative stock for a company with zero earnings, on a red Friday, BEFORE A THREE DAY WEEKEND, and it still shot up over 20%. I lost out on thousands of dollars because I sold my shares way to early and listened to the fucking bears. I have been bearish for a while, but after the past couple weeks, there is no point.\n\nThis is a retard\u2019s market. Logic and rational thinking gets you nowhere. A retard that YOLOs his life savings away will likely make more than someone who puts thought into their portfolio. I see that now. There\u2019s no point in thinking. I\u2019m still salty as fuck, if I had kept my calls I\u2019d be retired right now.\n\nBut I refuse to miss out any longer. I\u2019m trading in my claws for a set of horns. This market is incredibly autistic, but dammit I will not allow my own autism to be outperformed.", "created_utc": 1581791585, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f4dh9a/i_yield_to_the_bulls/", "is_self": true}
