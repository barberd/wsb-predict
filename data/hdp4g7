Since the death rate goes up among the elderly when GDP goes up ([https://jech.bmj.com/content/68/1/44.abstract](https://jech.bmj.com/content/68/1/44.abstract)), all the deaths occurring now must be the sun disappearing omen that GDP will go up bigly now that the USA has said: \"Fuck Kung-Flu, we're open for business.\"\n\nI figure the elderly and those who pass on got those tendies, that they spent their entire lives to earn. Those tendies pass on to their degenerate offsprings who will invest with their local OPTIONS dealers and frequent their local Robinhood casino, thus driving the economy to new heights. Couple this with unlimited support from our Lord and Savior, Jerome Powell, my prophecy from the printing machine spirits is that SPY will reach 400 by the end of the year. Therefore in order to honor the human sacrifices being made each and every day, we MUST buy stonks, and calls in order to drive this market to heights never before seen.\n\nBecause, if the market and economy crashes, then we may as well have kept the economy closed and spent time with those that would still be with us today.
