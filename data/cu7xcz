Thank you Paul Ryan!\n\nBUT:\n\n\n(e) Every Joe on the street now sees that he can get Cash Advance money from his credit card and only owe 19 percent on it, put that money into the Stock Market and earn freaking 50 percent!  That's RISK-FREE MONEY!\n\n(f) Joe on the Street starts taking these huge risks with his home equity and credit lines. \n\nThe Powers that Be, the Real Illuminati, the people who own the Banks, got really worried about this.  Whatever will we do to slow all those stupid little people down?!? We can't push credit card debt rates beyond the usurious 23.9 percent, no, legally, we can't! We have to do something!!\n\n(g) Since we already did the Tax part, let's do something else, let's do TARIFFS! That way we can also beat down that annoying trade deficit --- we buy 200 trillion worth of stuff from China but China only buys 400 billion worth of stuff from us! It's not right!\n\n(h) A tariff, then! Everything from China now comes with a 10 percent tariff! That will slow down all this China spending, while at the same time bringing us a 10 percent return!\n\n(i) Who pays the ten percent? Why, the American consumer, of course! But they won't like that, so let's just tell them that CHINA pays for it! They'll buy it up without thinking it through!\n\n**AND SO:**\n\nThey started a fire with Taxes, tried to put it out with Tariffs, and it's been working so well since the Stock Market is just the same right now as it was 20 months ago.  Every time they need the markets to \"COOL IT\" they tell Trump to send out another Tariff tweet.   He says it's \"not his Trade War\".  Hmm....\n\n=== === =====\n\nFeel free to discuss.", "created_utc": 1566529050, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cu7xcz/dd_why_the_us_stock_market_is_flatter_than_a/", "is_self": true}
