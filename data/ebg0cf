{"id": "ebg0cf", "title": "Weather Outlook Week of 16DEC19", "selftext": " This week is down to the buzzer cause I was too busy smashin some puss this weekend.  \n\nWeekly weather highlights:\n\nWest-Pacific NW: We got another warm front pushing in from the pacific should weaken over BC with another right behind it, focused into WA and northern OR with that round of precipitation. As trailing upper troughing sharpens, moisture plume should lift northward Friday as the cold front approaches before sinking southward through coastal OR/NorCal as the front moves onshore Saturday. Several inches of precipitation are expected but over a 2-3-day period with a likely break in between for a given location. Daytime temperatures will be near to above average overall with a trend cooler as the front moves inland this weekend. \n\nMidwest-East: Early in the week temperatures will be above average with dry conditions and upper ridging overhead. A quick cold shot will skirt through the Northeast on Thursday (10s/20s for highs and -0s/0s/10s for lows) jumping back to normal shortly after.  \n\nSoutheast: Coastal/Gulf system will provide some rainfall for the Southeast, depending on its evolution, with snow possible on its northern fringe in marginally colder air at generally higher elevations.  \n\n[16DEC2019 7:00 AM ET](https://i.redd.it/pqamp95x90541.gif)\n\n[16DEC2019 7:00 PM ET](https://i.redd.it/xujf9edda0541.gif)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[17DEC2019 7:00 PM ET](https://i.redd.it/6851g4jna0541.gif)\n\n6-10 Day Temperature Outlook: \n\n[Temperature Anomalies DEC 21-25](https://i.redd.it/irqsh185b0541.gif)\n\n[Precipitation Anomalies DEC 21-25](https://i.redd.it/2ae9c7c7b0541.gif)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSevere Weather Outlook: Nothing significant on the horizon.\n\nTLDR: Generally speaking we're looking at a warmer than normal week with a small cold snap in the midwest... but I really don't see any industry driving events.", "created_utc": 1576507531, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ebg0cf/weather_outlook_week_of_16dec19/", "is_self": true}
