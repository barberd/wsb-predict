There are also the type of retards who buy into AMD with 250+ PE ratio. What is the difference? One industry you have to be fucking dumb dropped as a baby in the head to invest and the other there might actually be merit because the company is making money. \n\nPeople just dont understand investing is NOT about \"OH THIS SECTOR IS GOING TO POP\" or \"ITS THE FUTURE\". YOU ARE FUCKING RETARD if you think that. \n\nInvesting is about putting your money in companies presenting good earnings and growth prospects. Even AMD is dumb at 250+ PE but its a lot better than that cannabis shit. You must have been dropped as a baby 50+ times to put your money thinking that sector would yield anything lmao.\n\nHappy new year!", "created_utc": 1577996254, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ej3kxv/a_tale_of_2_autists/", "is_self": true}
