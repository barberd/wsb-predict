DD inside.", "selftext": " \n\nMy fellow Aurtists.\n\nI am on my typical market induced drug binge and would like to give back to the world by giving a middle finger to the hedgefund activist assholes who use the great interwebs to swindle markets in favor of their shitty positions.\n\nHere it goes avoiding technical jargon and TLDRs from all you short attention spanned assholes, a simple trick for ya.\n\nOften times the activist professional autists with websites will take out a short position on a security and at a later time post a compelling article about how shitty the company is. Spoiler, they don't give two fucks about you and not doing this for charity.\n\nThe catch is that before their 3rd world Fiverr slave publishes the article on autist's site, they have to proofread the fucker and make sure everything looks good, is in English with all porn removed from image place holders.\n\nThere is something called sitemap.xml for example (read between the lines \ud83d\udd95 )lemonjuiceresearch.com/sitemap.xml, in this map you may occasionally find an easter egg like for example the said slave's draft a day or two prior, definitely hours. **Before the news drops.**\n\nThere other tricks(fuzz will fuck it up for everyone probably) and other sites which will probably be promptly addressed by professional trolls after I post this, don't make your shit public assholes.\n\nEnjoy picking up your free tendies in front of a bus. Timing for this post is because some things tend to go bleed once a month.
