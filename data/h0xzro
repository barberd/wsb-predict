Assuming JPow doesn\u2019t bring out his synthetic green dildo, im expecting more red days. \n\nDon\u2019t freak out, DCA. Say it with me autists: Dollar. Cost. Average. Buy cheaper stock to bring down your average and then hold. Do not, I repeat, do not go super saiyan level autist and buy high and sell low (unless you didn\u2019t do any research on the company, which may go bankrupt, in which case you\u2019re shit out of luck and you definitely belong here).\n\nFor my people with options, where are my \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b at??? What are you holding?\n\nPosition: IWM 133.5P 06/19 (sold my MSFT calls yesterday, and sold my airline stocks last week).", "created_utc": 1591876920.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h0xzro/psa_if_your_stocks_are_dipping_dont_freak_out/", "is_self": true}
