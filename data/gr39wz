{"id": "gr39wz", "title": "DD for next 10 days (#PandemicCancelled plays)", "selftext": "Today Vegas will most likely announce reopening for **June 4th**. It's not official yet but pretty much everyone knows that's the date. $**MGM** was one of the hardest hit of the Vegas stocks, $**WYNN** and $**LVS** are good plays too but I prefer MGM. If there is anyone who is likely to take a risk on Corona is gonna be the gamblers and Johns. People forget Johns are a huge portion of Vegas business. Corona is nothing compared to HIV or Hepatitis B that Johns risk every day. What about reduced casino capacity? they will take out low limit tables, which will force the cheap players to up their game and lose money faster on medium level tables. There is plenty of slutmachines, they are never close to 50% utilized. So no issues there. The only problem is corporate events that are cancelled, but you are playing the news so that doesn't matter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBombardier recreational division ($**DOOO**) will be reporting this week. They had an amazing quarter and sold a lot of ATVs, sea-doos and Can-Am bikes to people with stimulus cheques. They also benefited from stronger USD since the make a lot of their stuff in Canada. They had a poor 2019 because of short winter selling few ski-doos, so expectations are low. Also people who are not going on family vacations due to social distancing are buying a lot of Sea-doos. **Earnings call June 28th BMO.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDocuSign (**$DOCU**) and Zoom ($**ZM**) are reporting next week. Both are Corona stocks. I expect both will report spectacular earnings but not sure how the market will react since Pandemic is cancelled.

They had an amazing online sales due to pandemic. They are also benefiting from stronger US dollar since they are based in Canada just like LULU. This is a Becky stock and they report **June 28th AMC.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Sea World ($SEAS)**  gets most of its revenue year round compared to the other theme parks. It's very seasonal but less so than SIX or Disney parks. It's EXACTLY half the price of February highs. It has no competition when it comes to #dolphinEntertainment. Since #PandemicIsCancelled, the **upside is 1X**. Never bet against dolphins and killer whales.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n$**SPCE** Thursday morning all headlines are going to read '*America enters a new space age*'. Wednesday will be the first human launch from USA since 2011.

Now SPCE has nothing to do with SpaceX but that's not gonna stop $SPCE from going to moon.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not your financial advisor.
