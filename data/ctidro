{"id": "ctidro", "title": "Found relationship between WMT and AMD", "selftext": "After seeing what happened with Target this morning we all know consumer sentiment is up, or at least we think we know, but how can we really really know?\n\nThe answer is simple.  Please observe the following chart:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/hY7pU6w.png\n\nAs you can see, between 1997 and 2003, as the Armadillo (AMD) population count in Arkansas went down, Walmart (WMT) stock price went up with a logarithmic correlation around ~18ln(x).  This is because as we had more trucks running on the road, more armadillos were getting run over because they are slow.\n\nIn short, Arkansas' entire economy is inversely related to the Armadillo population.  So if we can just get our claws on some fresh Armadillo data it could be worth millions upon millions for all of us.\n\nIf there is anyone out there who can help us with the AMD count from this summer please let us know ASAP so we can load up on either calls or puts, thanks.", "created_utc": 1566401219, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ctidro/found_relationship_between_wmt_and_amd/", "is_self": true}
