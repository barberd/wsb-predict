Or is that scenario just a possibility in tin-foil hat land?\n\nIf I'm wrong on this, and just a moron; I'll probably hold my 3/20 puts, but if this is something that could actually happen; I'll probably sell my puts after a level 2 stop to be safe and possibly buy a couple calls for Monday if I'm feeling like gambling.", "created_utc": 1584052047.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhoy97/tendie_protection_plan/", "is_self": true}
