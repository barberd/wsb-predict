{"id": "fennbj", "title": "Macy's DD", "selftext": "You're probably tired of hearing what to short but lemme tell ya what you could be making on mid to long range when the supply chains eat shit. \n\nMacy's. \n\nProbably you've heard this randomly put out there, I know I've said it for a few weeks. But lemme tell ya. While jc Penny's exists as a stock at the 75c range, Macy's could very well get close to this by late fall.\n\nThey are a mall based outlet that has failed over the past few years to online streamline thier products and keep up with the times, they rely on consumer facing and people mall shopping. They rely insanley on chinas manufacturing and tons of companies that they stock as well. They haven't gotten any better with it.  That's all about to go to shit completely soon. \n\nMy mother is a huge online shopper and used to ship there big time in stores, she and all the people she knows are all about JCPenneys, Amazon and all that other middle age Becky shit, Macy's has fallen off. \n\nThey are cutting 200 stores and 2500 jobs throughout. \n\nFully understand they have good revenue past few qts and been around expectstions but the decline is constant. The that dividend they are putting out is absolutely retarted. If they don't cut it it's gonna pull back more and more and with the wubeersuperflu coming, the white mom's that do go to Macy's will be scared shitl.ess to go outside little lone a fucking mall.  Once they report 2nd and 3rd qts after fucking noone goes out anymore to buy clothes and fucking bullshit they can get online, they go there to look, people have adapted.\n\nThey are a 90s company operating like a fucking early 2000s company in 2020\n\n\n\n\nTLDR $M late year puts, still cheap as fuck\n\nHolding 1/25/21 13p, selling my 3/13 12ps I've had for a few months rolling into some 11s in Sept/Oct", "created_utc": 1583543240.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fennbj/macys_dd/", "is_self": true}
