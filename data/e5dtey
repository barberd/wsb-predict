I have the right to free speech, protest, and access to the press. \n\nYou autists should know if you figure out where the drug lords and other cash stashers are by means of searching the web, \n\nif you find a way to model the economy as a battery in the same way (make sure you look into logarithms and the 80/20 rule of the pareto curve) you'll be able to suck money out of it with options like it's a fucking joke. \n\njust make a web of known entities with power that have a heirarchy by their crossings of geography, philosophies, politics and financial interests. \n\nThen measure the volatility and movement of their assets to their main competitors. \n\nSuddenly, somewhere in a galaxy far far away by a crazy Computer Scientist's hands and open source plan to make a thing maker that prints money echoes into the distance, making a love of money the root of all evil.", "created_utc": 1575359676, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e5dtey/qed_the_economy_is_a_general_equilibrium_time/", "is_self": true}
