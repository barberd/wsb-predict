Hikma needs to prove claims by patents are obvious to anyone 75% of the times. \n\nPost finding of facts by both sides have been filed. \n\nPost trial briefs should be filed by Feb 28th. \n\nDecision is scheduled by March 31.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think the case is down to how the label of Hikma\u2019s generic Vascepa is read from the viewpoint of the clinician in treatment duration. Both side fact finding document referenced the label should be from the viewpoint of the clinician. \n\nAmarin Vascepa label does not have an explicit treatment duration. Amarin argues the label imply chronic usage. Hence, there is no duration. There are two reasons for taking Vascepa for life. First reason is severe hyper triglyceridemia (&gt;500mg/dL) is genetic based and therefore, chronic. Additionally, FDA approved indication is for chronic usage. The clinical study, MARINE Trial, (FDA approval of Vascepa for treatment of severe hypertriglycemia is based on) is cited in Clinical Trial section of the both Amarin and Hikma product labels. The clinical study is based on the 12 weeks endpoint data. Amarin argues duration is implied to be at least 12 weeks. Amarin expert stated most physician view treatment duration for severe hyper triglyceridemia is chronic for 95% of the times. \n\nHikma argues, importantly, there is 5% of the times that duration treatment is not chronic. Acute usage of less than 12 weeks should be allowed. There no is explicit and implicit duration treatment in the label. There is mentioning of 12 weeks in randomized study in the Clinical Studies. That is just a description and cannot be interpreted as instructions. And if were interpreted as instruction, anything shorter than 12 weeks would be allowed still. Vascepa therapeutic effects peak at 4 weeks. At least 12 weeks or more duration is not needed. Less than 12 weeks would be enough to obtained the therapeutic effects. From there, severe hyper triglyceridemia can be managed alone by diet and exercise. Hikma noted, \u201c\u2026doctors frequently prescribe Vascepa long-term for other reasons, than the indication for severe hyper triglyceridemia.\u201d If allowed for less than 12 weeks, Hikma would not be infringing on any patent. Almost every Amarin patents call for 12 weeks treatment. If less than 12 weeks, there is no patent infringement. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTrial notes...\n\n  \n\nTrial Summary Notes (Posted by RobCos from ivillage. Logged by https://twitter.com/TerraPharma1/status/1217082505464971264.):\n\nDay 1\n\n[https://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=2294&amp;mn=6405&amp;pt=msg&amp;mid=20172585](https://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=2294&amp;mn=6405&amp;pt=msg&amp;mid=20172585)\n\n(Thank you for posting, RobCos from ivillage!)\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nWe are attending the AMRN court case in Reno, NV. Day 1 included opening statements and direct/cross-examination of AMRN's CSO. Our initial takeaway is Hikma/Reddy's appeared to be aggressive as expected. While it is just the first day and still early, we will be interested in seeing how AMRN responds and any commentary from the Judge. The trial is scheduled for 3 weeks w/ pot'l decision by March/April.\n\nInsights\n\nSummary: Today began with each side giving 20-25 min opening statements w/ 15-25 exhibits (e.g., KOL statements, excerpts from publications, etc). We found the opening arguments mostly in line, with each side outlining claims in favor or against the non-obviousness of the (+) effects of Vascepa and infringement of the approved label. Direct examination of AMRN's CSO Dr. Ketchum was most interesting in providing insight into the development of Vascepa. Cross-examination was focused on demonstrating the obviousness of the Vascepa results through several examples of AMRN using/discussing prior studies (e.g., JELIS study) to support continued development of Vascepa. While early, Hikma/Reddy's were aggressive in their line of questioning. \n\nOverall however, we maintain a positive view on AMRN and believe AMRN will see their patent upheld and they are in a good position to win.\n\nOpening arguments...Hikma/Reddy's appeared particularly cogent. AMRN attorneys claimed: \n\n1)VASCEPA results were non-obvious, particularly the decrease in Trigs w/o an increase in LDL, citing review articles and other statements at the time suggesting it was universally believed prior to Vascepa an LDL increase w/ trig reduction was an unavoidable on target effect. \n\n2) While the label does not specify a duration of treatment with Vascepa, it is implied EPA has to be given chronically as the disease is mostly genetic and even the FDA's review documents for Vascepa refer to the drug for chronic administration.\n\nThe defense (Hikma/Reddy) opening arguments claimed: \n\n1) based on the literature, it was obvious that DHA increased LDL, and removal of this component could potentially reduce Trigs w/o impacting LDL. The defense also claimed the patent examiner cited this prior art. \n\n2) Nothing in the label states/requires chronic therapy and they made the argument that it as reasonable to give EPA for &lt;12 wks followed by proper exercise and diet to manage trigs. As a reminder, in our diligence with experts, a significant majority of doctors would need to believe this and the burden is on the defense to prove this.\n\nDuring cross-examination the defense cited several examples of AMRN using publications to support the development of Vascepa. The defense claimed March 2008 was the critical date AMRN is said to have created Vascepa. To support its view AMRN's patents were invalid due to obviousness, the defense went through several documents, including internal emails, regulatory documents (e.g., pre-IND,sNDA, etc) to FDA and presentations to investors citing clinical studies done before 2008 supporting the use of an EPA only product. In response, the plaintiff made the argument that while citing these studies, they were flawed or had caveats that made drawing overarching conclusion not obvious.\n\nDay 2\n\nhttps://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read\\_msg.aspx?message\\_id=153302835\n\nhttps://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=2294&amp;mn=6420&amp;pt=msg&amp;mid=20176390\n\nThank you RobCos from ivillage J\n\n\\*Front Row\\*: Hikma/Reddy's Request for Immediate Ruling was Dismissed...\n\nJanuary 15, 2020\n\nInsights\n\nSummary: Today began w/ direct/cross-examination of AMRN's expert cardiologist Dr. Matt Budoff. Following redirect of AMRN's witness, the defense asked the judge to rule on the induced infringement claim, stating they believe AMRN failed to meet the burden of proof. Following 5-10 min presentations from both parties, the judge indicated she would need more time to formulate her ruling. The day ended w/ the Judge dismissing the defendants' request to rule on the infringement claim citing the initial burden of proof had been met. We continue to think AMRN is in a good position in the case.\n\nA majority of today's proceedings focused on the induced infringement claim and interpretation of the label; there appears to be more room for debate than initially thought, however. Recall, AMRN is claiming HIkma/Reddy's generic label induces infringement on AMRN's patents that cover treatment with Vascepa for 12 weeks or more. During direct examination, AMRN's witness Dr. Budoff reviewed severe hypertriglyceridemia (SHTG), the label, and systematically provided his reasoning as to why a majority of docs prescribing Vascepa would use it for \"chronic treatment\" thus any generic using the current label would infringe on AMRN's 12wk+ patents.\n\nDuring cross-examination, the defense noted nothing in the label explicitly indicates Vascepa has to be used for 12wk+ and highlighted AMRN's own internal and expert  testimonies that indicated SHTG could be an acute phenomenon and the label does not limit the drug for chronic use only. Dr. Budoff defended his earlier testimony well by stating if the drug is used as indicated by the label, all acute reasons to use the drug would be excluded thus providing a counterargument to the defense. While the judge has not tipped her hand on which way she is leaning through comments or questions, she has shown keen interest throughout the trial in the defense's arguments and to us looks clearly willing to accept to new information. The bottom line is whether the judge would rule in favor of AMRN because a majority of docs will use it chronically - or in favor of generics because there are situations where \"acute use\" is OK and that is sufficient to not infringe. That said - the Summary Judgment before the trial did suggest the argument by the defense was weak.\n\nThe judge appeared to really mull over the defense's motion to immediately dismiss the induced infringement claim. The judge concluded based on Dr. Budoff testimony, which stated if following the label, \"most docs\" would prescribe generic EPA chronically, the plaintiff has met the initial burden of proof. It will be interesting see how her interpretation may change following examination of the defense's expert cardiologist witness.\n\nDay 3\n\nhttps://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=2294&amp;mn=6440&amp;pt=msg&amp;mid=20180018\n\nThank you RobCos from ivillage +)\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nDay 3 of AMRN vs. Hikma/Reddy's trial focused on the claim of nonobviousness and examination of the defense's witness. Cross-examination went well for AMRN with the witness faulting several times on AMRN's line of questioning. With the burden of proof already high for obviousness, barring some new evidence or radical interpretation by the Judge, we think AMRN is likely to prevail on upholding the patent.\n\nSummary: The day began w/ continued direct examination of Hikma/DRL cardiology expert witness Dr. Sheinberg, followed by a relatively brief cross-examination by AMRN. The obviousness portion of the trial commenced w/ Hikma/DRL calling their expert witness Dr. Jay Heinecke, an expert in the field of lipoprotein/lipid disorders. Cross-examination of Dr. Heinecke was contentious to say the least, with many of his claims questioned/disproven and he displayed visible difficulty in answering the defense's questions. Court resumes Fri w/ testimony from the defense's experts Ivan Hofmann and Dr. Edward Fisher (cardiologist). As a reminder - trial will last a total of three weeks to end of January and a decision is expected around March/April 2020.\n\nInitial thoughts on Judge Miranda Du: Throughout the first three days of the trial, Judge Du has been relatively quiet, clearly absorbing and contemplating witness's testimony. In general, we found her to be most attentive during today's cross-examinations. Altogether, she strikes us as someone who is procedural (i.e., by the book) and unlikely to come to an \u201cout of the box\u201d ruling.\n\nThe defense's witness had a difficult time demonstrating the patent had clear prior art and in keeping his cool. Recall, when it comes to nonobviousness, the burden of proof lies on the defense to show that there is a clear body of prior art that a person of skill in the field would use to develop the invention/patents that AMRN is asserting. \n\nDr. Heinecke attempted to show prior art for AMRN's primarily asserted claims: \n\n1) EPA at least 96%, \n\n2) at least 12 weeks of duration of treatment, \n\n3) dose of 4 g/day of drug and \n\n4) use in pts w/ TG \u2265500 mg/dL. \n\nOn the first three points, one could see a scenario where an argument (although remote) could be made that prior art describes these claims. The last point was where the expert was most visibly frustrated, with the prosecution highlighting that many of the publications cited as evidence of prior art were not applicable as they did not include pts w/ TG \u2265500 mg/dL. The judge and even members of defense were visibly frustrated by the witness' (belligerent) performance during cross-examination.\n\nRebuttal of AMRN's considerations of nonobviousness also refuted by the expert's own publication. AMRN is also asserting secondary considerations to assist in showing nonobviouness: failure of others, unexpected results, skepticism and long unmet medical need. While the expert contended AMRN failed to meet these considerations, the defense was able to show these were also met, w/ the last point of long unmet medical need addressed with the defense citing the expert's own 2007 publication (one year before AMRN's invention) that states the need for new drugs to reduce cardiovascular disease.\n\nDay 4\n\nhttps://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=2294&amp;mn=6479&amp;pt=msg&amp;mid=20192232\n\nThank you RobCos from ivillage =)\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nMaintain Buy and believe AMRN remains in a good position in ongoing patent trial. Day 4 included testimony from Hikma/Reddy's expert witness on the claim of obviousness. In our view, his testimony didn't appear to add much to Hikma/DRL's case given some of his statements under cross-examination from AMRN.\n\nInsights\n\nSummary: We believe AMRN remains in a good position to protect its patents on \"infringement\" and \"obviousness\". We don't believe the generics have made a strong case or met the burden for proving they don't infringe (since it mostly always requires chronic dosing), and obviousness (the results of Vascepa were surprising and unexpected).\n\nDay 4 focused on direct and cross-examination of Dr. Edward Fisher, the defense's expert witness tasked with arguing AMRN's patents are invalid due to prior art. Dr. Fisher is a preventative cardiologist and was a witness during the PCSK9 trial (on behalf of AMGN though). Court will be in session on Tuesday and is expected to begin with testimony from Hikma/DRL's final witness on obviousness, Ivan Hofmann, their commercial success expert.\n\nDr. Fisher's testimony contained several contradictory elements, in our view: \n\n1) During Dr. Fisher's direct examination he only cited AMRN's documents, including its communications w/ the FDA for the ANCHOR sNDA, and the positive comments on JELIS as evidence the REDUCE-IT outcome was obvious. His use of only AMRN docs was highlighted during cross-examination by AMRN's lawyers and cited as proof AMRN believed JELIS was a good representative study of the effects of EPA alone vs EPA/DHA mixtures.\n\n2) In his prior deposition, Dr. Fisher opined JELIS provided clear evidence that REDUCE-IT would work. However, AMRN's lawyers noted in his deposition he also said JELIS supported a positive outcome for AZN's Epanova (EPA/DHA mixture) STRENGTH study. But last week the STRENGTH study ultimately stopped early for futility, and AMRN's lawyers highlighted this failure as evidence of the debate around EPA vs. EPA/DHA and the difficulty of predicting results and obviousness for anyone skilled in the art.\n\n3) During cross-examination AMRN's lawyers questioned Dr. Fisher on several failed clinical studies of other fish oils prior to 2008 as well. This line of questioning resulted in Dr. Fisher eventually admitting he was not aware of many of the other studies (some were published in the NEJM) and during 2000-2010 he was more focused on basic research, thus calling into question his ability to assess the \"obviousness\" of patents.\n\nAMRN might seek a motion to dismiss Hikma/DRL's claim of obviousness. Recall, the burden of proof is with the defense to prove AMRN's patents are invalid. Following the defense's witness on Tuesday, AMRN could seek immediate dismissal of the obviousness claim such that only infringement would be left to rule on. While this is possible, it's not expected and since Judge Du has mostly been \"by the book\", she would be expected to let the trial proceed.\n\nDay 5 - Off\n\nThank you RobCos from ivillage :D\n\nDay 6\n\nhttps://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=2294&amp;mn=6535&amp;pt=msg&amp;mid=20218301\n\nThank you RobCos from ivillage :)\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nThe final week of trial included direct-examination of AMRN's expert witness on obviousness. AMRN continues to bolster its case with the witness rebutting many of Hikma/DRL's arguments, in our view. With only 1-2 days left, we continue to think AMRN has made a compelling case against generics. The trial is expected to end this week and a pot'l decision possibly in March/April.\n\nSummary: AMRN's expert witness, Dr. Peter Toth, took the stand and provided evidence as to non-obviousness of AMRN's patents, rebutting prior testimony from Hikma/DRL's witnesses. Tomorrow (Tue) includes closing direct-examination of Dr. Toth by AMRN, followed by cross-examination by Hikma/DRL. No new witnesses are expected, and barring any new developments, the in-court portion of the trial is expected to conclude on Tuesday or Wednesday.\n\nAMRN's key witness Dr. Toth provided convincing arguments in favor of AMRN and its novel patent...Dr. Toth covered several topics and notably provided three cogent counter arguments in support of AMRN's non-obviousness claim and the uniqueness of Vascepa:\n\n1. Dr. Toth noted prior to Vascepa, it was widely believed there was an invariable link between decreasing triglycerides and an increase in LDL in very high triglyceride patients. Across multiple drug classes with varying MOA (e.g. niacin, fibrates, fish oils), this was observed, leading most to believe it was an on-target consequence. Thus, the decrease in trigs w/o impacting LDL observed with Vascepa \u2013 is a clear departure from the prevailing theory and prior evidence of other drugs.\n\n2. He also noted DHA was thought to be better for CV outcomes and Vascepa does not use DHA. This was based on the observation that DHA and not EPA, increases HDL and LDL particle size and decreases blood pressure. The combination of these benefits were thought to confer benefits that were exclusive to DHA containing products. Multiple failures of fish oil containing product outcome studies, most recently the AZN STRENGTH study, has now largely disproven this theory.\n\n3. Dr. Toth argued against the notion there were a limited number of therapeutic options and a pure EPA drug was the obvious next step, noting there were \"hundreds of potential options\" that could have been explored, including new types of fibrates and fish oils with omega 6 or 9. In his view, the bevy of potential options make AMRN's decision to develop a pure EPA product clearly non-obvious.\n\nIn our view, the intensity on Hikma/DRL's side has clearly waned; we wonder if this will have any impact on a potential settlement. As we have highlighted in our series of notes, AMRN has made a compelling case throughout the trial. We get the sense Hikma/DRL also recognize this with much of the internal deliberation between Hikma/DRL that could be observed earlier in the trial, now ceasing. It will be interesting to see how much of a fight Hikma/DRL put up Tuesday during cross-examination and/or rebuttal and whether it is predictive of any pot'l to settle or appeal in an event they lose the case. For what its worth, the number of attendees on Hikma/DRL's side of the courtroom has gone from 10+ people at the start of the trial to less than 5 today.\n\nhttps://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=2294&amp;mn=6538&amp;pt=msg&amp;mid=20220933\n\nDay 7\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nIn court proceedings for the AMRN vs. Hikma/Reddy's case have ended, following 7 days of expert witness testimony. The judge did not provide a preliminary ruling or hint at which way she is ruling, but she did state the written ruling will be made by March 31. We continue to think AMRN has made a compelling argument for induced infringement and nonobviousness and see the stock up +10-20% on a positive ruling.\n\nInsights\n\nBig Picture: AMRN stock has been relatively range bound the last month despite positive news on the competitive front with two key competitor trials having failed. \n\nWe attribute this stock action to investor focus on the uncertainty associated with the AMRN trial and the potential risk for Hikma/DRL to present some \"bombshell\" evidence. With in court proceedings for the trial now completed, and Hikma/DRL having presented their best case, we are now more confident that AMRN is likely to prevail, removing the chief overhang on the stock.\n\nSummary and timing of Judge Du's written decision: \n\nDay 7 included cross-examination of AMRN's expert witness Dr. Peter Toth, followed by redirect and recross. The day ended early with the Judge setting a March 31st deadline for her written ruling. We get the sense the decision will likely be more of a late March event, as the prosecution/defense have to submit their post findings of facts by Feb 14th and post trial briefs by Feb 28th and the Judge noting \"I'll have a month\" to write the ruling.\n\nWe think it will be hard to not rule in favor of AMRN. As a reminder, the key claims in dispute are: 1)Induced Infringement: AMRN had to show that a doc prescribing Hikma/DRL generic Vascepa would be more than likely (\\~51%) to infringe on AMRN's patents covering 12+ weeks of dosing. On this front, AMRN was able to clearly show that most docs, including Hikma/DRL's expert witnesses, would prescribe generic Vascepa for more than 12 weeks - infringing on AMRN's patent. \n\n2) Obviousness: Hikma/DRL had to show that there was a high likelihood (\\~75%) that AMRN's patents were obvious and someone skilled in the art would have easily developed Vascepa based on the prior art (e.g., studies, publications, etc). While Hikma/DRL did present some interesting evidence in support of obviousness, we thought constant citation of AMRN documents by their expert witnesses was a glaring hole in their case.\n\n...Profile of the Judge...\n\nMiranda Mai Du (born December 11, 1969) is a Chief United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Nevada.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miranda\\_Du\n\nBorn December 11, 1969 (age 50)\n\nC\u00e0 Mau, South Vietnam\n\n(now Vietnam)\n\nEducation University of California, Davis (B.A.)\n\nUniversity of California, Berkeley School of Law (J.D.)\n\nEarly life and education \n\nBorn in C\u00e0 Mau, Vietnam, Du left the country at age 9, when her family sought asylum in Malaysia.\\[1\\] They spent a year in Malaysian refugee camps before ultimately being granted asylum in the United States.\\[1\\] \n\nDu received \n\na Bachelor of Arts from University of California, Davis in 1991 and \n\na Juris Doctor from University of California, Berkeley School of Law in 1994.\\[2\\]\\[3\\]\n\nProfessional career\n\nUpon graduating law school, Du took a job as an associate at the law firm McDonald Carano Wilson LLP.

Echavarria's attorneys argued that his trial was unfair because the presiding judge was also being investigated by the FBI \u2013 a fact they did not learn until after the trial ended. Judge Du agreed and ruled that Echavarria was entitled to a new trial.\\[13\\]\n\nIn October 2016, Judge Du granted several Nevada Native American tribes a preliminary injunction which required the state to set up early voting and election day polling locations on their reservations. The plaintiffs argued that many of them would have to travel nearly 100 miles round trip to reach polling sites, and that Section II of The Voting Rights Act of 1965 required the state to take the location of their reservations into account when planning polling locations. Judge Du agreed in part, granting preliminary early voting and election day relief, but found that the plaintiffs did not have standing to seek in-person voter registration staffing as well.\\[14\\]", "created_utc": 1581985929, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f5it0y/end_of_amrn_patent_trial_in_end_of_march_go_long/", "is_self": true}
