In my country, that means if stock price is 100 and the call option is 5, that means only 5 will be deducted from my account (I can later sell or exercise the option before expiration).\n\nHowever, I also have now a TD Ameritrade account in USA, and I tried to purchase 10 Tesla calls now, a bit out of the money (USD 380 expiring in November, a dumb bet in the spirit of this sub), but instead of the \\~ USD 50 I was expecting, the summary of operation showed \\~ USD 4 K... (I didn't go ahead).\n\nWhat is the point of options trading if it will deduct the full amount of the stock?
