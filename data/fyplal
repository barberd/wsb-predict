(Personally, I'm neutral at this point, since nothing makes sense and anything is possible.)\n\nI get that it's fun to make fun of gay bears and their losses. But, seriously, do you wholeheartedly believe we're in the middle of the fabled v-shaped recovery and shooting up to ATH from here?\n\nLike, it was one of the most massive crashes of all time, economy is still largely shut down, with massive unemployment, but in a few weeks we'll just resume where we left off in mid February, like nothing ever happened?\n\nMoney printer or not, doesn't this kind of recovery sound *a little* too good to be true?\n\nEDIT:  STFU with your \"brrr\" bullshit.  I'm not implying you're wrong or right.
