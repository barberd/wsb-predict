No moms. No basic white girls. Attached Starbucks was empty. \n\nThen it dawned on me: The Devil Wears Prada. Where angry devil lady tells Princess Mia that fashion trickles down to the plebes, so too is this true for Targ\u00e9t.\n\nWhat used to be hip and trendy for hot Beckys to prance about and shop and avoid Wally World, has now become an overpriced shell of itself. \n\nThe veneer that made it targ\u00e9t becky\u2019s preference has worn off and left it another average department store, with only sad fupas and frumps gracing its overpriced aisles. Gone are the perky rumps and baby bumps the white ad dog once drew!\n\nShort TGT - get tendies elsewhere.", "created_utc": 1578358639, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/el3k7e/short_tgt/", "is_self": true}
