The pandemic is only just getting under way in the USA, which has an inadequate health system combined with a large population of individuals with underlying health issues. The S&P 500 is currently trading at a PE ratio of\u00a018.63, which is still above the long term median (14.82) and mean (15.78). Congress can hand increasingly larger checks to businesses, however there is no replacement for aggregate demand halving. I expect it will be a long time until we see the S&P 500 back up to 3,400.\u00a0\n\nS&P will keep dropping as the infection rages through the US, and the stimulus funds get caught up in the usual beauracracies over the next few months.", "created_utc": 1585254699.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpj1tr/this_crisis_has_a_long_way_to_go/", "is_self": true}
