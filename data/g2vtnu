Some 'facts'. \nStat news is not a AAA source but who is these days? \nRemedsvir has been tested by several countries\nThe report has already been disowned by Gilead, but this could have been fake news too. \nContrary data were reported by other sources earlier. \n\nSo whodunit? \n\nRelease of this report after market close and trump's opening plan makes it seem like it was him but this could be any common criminal. \n\nThe fact market gapped in the hour between futures closed and opening means possibly large MM involved. Pros at work here. \n\nhappened day before OPEX leans more towards MM.\n\nLarge options volume of GILD prior looks like a common criminal.\n\nWho knows, maybe both happened at same time... LoL. \n\nStop thinking and just stfu and buy stinks.", "created_utc": 1587101664.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2vtnu/a_market_so_manipulated_that_you_cannot_tell_if/", "is_self": true}
