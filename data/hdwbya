They'll burn down the world to prevent any difficulties for a corporation. I believe the conversation between the airlines and the government went something like this:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUAL: \"Mommy! Mommy! No one is buying plane tickets!\"\n\nJP & Govt: \"Aww, UAL. You mean you have $5bn in monthly operational expenses and only $20mm in cash reserves? That's ok, honey. Here is $10bn. You deserve all the money in the world!\"\n\nUAL: \"Fuck you Mommy! I'm laying everyone off. $10bn is nothing!\"\n\nJP & Govt: \"I'm so sorry UAL! Tell you what, we'll buy all your bonds. And at a nice 50% haircut!\"\n\nUAL: \"You better do that fast. Or I'll layoff everyone! I swear!\"\n\nJP & Govt: \"Of course honey, we will get that ASAP! With no strings attached. None of this is your fault! No one expects you to be able to cover more than 3 hours of lost revenue!\"", "created_utc": 1592845858.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hdwbya/helicopter_government/", "is_self": true}
