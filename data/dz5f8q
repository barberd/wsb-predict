Landed on Apple.  \n3) DD coming from a random WSB post with some random links from two months ago that said Google threw shade at Apple bc Google found a security breach ( [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dz4lsq/i\\_was\\_told\\_aapl\\_stonks\\_only\\_go\\_up\\_then\\_why\\_my\\_fd/f856u7l](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dz4lsq/i_was_told_aapl_stonks_only_go_up_then_why_my_fd/f856u7l) )  \n4) Built this whole narrative over the course of 20 minutes with a buddy that involves China using the breach to track Hong Kong protesters, many of which have iPhones.  However, China couldn't just pull HK user data only so they just hacked a database and took everything they could get their hands on.\n\nLooking for a 1000% gain.  Will post update, however if Apple doesn't finish below $250 on 11/29 then you know that the tin foil hat theory failed.", "created_utc": 1574271741, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dz5f8q/apple_1129_250_long_put_yolo_full_retard_dd/", "is_self": true}
