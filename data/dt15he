I'm treating it like a trip to the casino: I'm here to have a little fun and see how long I can make my cash pool last (minus the cocktail waitresses, unfortunately), but I'm okay if I lose it all. I'm trying to start small so my inevitable mistakes and learning curves don't hurt too bad. I'm using TDA for brokerage. I'm now spending time looking at charts and waiting to see something (you're supposed to SEE something in the numbers, right?). You guys have obviously learned plenty in your time so far. Is there anything I should/shouldn't do right off the bat? Things to avoid or ways to start processing this data dump of a market in a way that doesn't make you want to shoot yourself?", "created_utc": 1573148433, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dt15he/just_starting_out_needing_some_direction/", "is_self": true}
