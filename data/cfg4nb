I did a total of 62 DD's last Sunday and I went through them all to see what was actually profitable (assuming you bought at the beginning of the week). 20 of them miraculously survived this bearish week and are still green (or flat) and 4 were FDs and total losses (JPM, BAC, JNJ, NFLX). I've excluded the one ones that were profitable at some point during the week but lost at the end. The rest are long so we'll have to see how things play out. I've bolded the ones that are up bigly.\n\n| Green | \n|-----------|\n| V 180 / 175 iron condors. | \n| **DELL 10/18 55 / 60 call credit spread** $ |\n| **IBM 7/19 145C or 9/20 150C** $$$ |\n| DE 9/20 155P | \n| FL 9/20 45C | \n| TSLA 8/16 250C |\n| IRBT 7/26 90P | \n| BABA 9/20 175C | \n| ABBV 8/16 75C | \n| **CMI 8/16 170C or 175C** $$ |\n| **PM 7/19 82.5C** $$$ |\n| GE 11 / 10 iron condors |\n| CGC JAN 2020 40 |\n| F 11 / 10 iron condors. |\n| FCX 7/26 11.5/12 call debit spread |\n| PI 30 or 35P |\n| TLRD 11/15 |\n| CRON Jan 2021 20C | \n| ANET 8/16 280C |\n| EBAY Jan 2020 42 |\n\nCalls that survived this week are probably a good sign, the puts might be a confirmation of a trend.
