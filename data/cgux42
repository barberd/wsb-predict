{"id": "cgux42", "title": "BYND Daily Borrow Rate update", "selftext": "I know this will seem hard to believe, but so far this bump up in BYND has not technically been a short squeeze. The short borrow rates that I have found are about 143%, flat from yesterday and the end of last week. S3 also confirms that short interest has only moved a little and short borrow rates are not changed that much. From S3: \"BYND short int is $1.006 bn; 5.18 mm shs shorted; 44.23% of float; 132% stock borrow fee on existing shorts &amp; 147% fee on new borrows.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nErgo, a short squeeze still might be on the table. It is probably not the LIKELIEST outcome, but it is possible. Typically with a short squeeze we would see short interest fall 10-20% on an absolute basis. (so short interest decrease from 44% to 34%, for example). Also, for those of us who think this could be another TLRY, Tilray's short borrow rate topped out at a daily rate of 900%, with a gradual increase over the proceeding days/weeks. So we are still not there yet. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI still am holding my August 16th $200calls. I rolled over all of my $100c and $140's in $200 calls. I also took my initial investment off the table so I am only playing with profit and hence have a bigger risk tolerance than I otherwise would have. PLEASE know that this is NOT a good long term investment and will likely crash at some point. Only trade with money that you are literally throwing away. This is insanely risky and no one should copy what I am doing. Also don't listen to me.", "created_utc": 1563899706, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cgux42/bynd_daily_borrow_rate_update/", "is_self": true}
