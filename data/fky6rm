The American Economy, and all of their businesses, cannot possibly survive with no revenue for so long, and thus the strongest Capitalist system in the entire world would collapse. Our Fed is already going to have to print money to pay for these stimulus plans in the markets, and once that happens the dollar will weaken drastically, making it harder on our corporations to rebound around the world. Now listen up autists:\n\nThe reason Ackman bought stocks today, fully knowing that the companies he bought can absolutely go to zero, is because *this is the moment where we are all in or not*. It's the ultimate YOLO. Because if we do not take these extreme steps, our economy will completely tank. Ackman is betting on Trump doing the right thing, which is the massively extreme national lockdown (imo it will be 21 days not 30 days). We feel incredible pain short term, but we will absolutely get through it and FINALLY SEE THE LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL. That fucking light is our Economic system not collapsing. If we do not take this extreme measure, companies will fail, go to zero, the government cannot possibly bail out all of the institutions, and our entire system will collapse and assets will be essentially worthless, so why not throw some longs in there today. Look to Zimbabwe to see what happens when a government can't shut the printer. Now how do you think the ripples from that happening to America would shake the world?\n\nNot to mention, the current risk of China and some other countries sending a bill to some of the trillions of T-Bills we owe around the world, but that's another story.\n\nBottom Line: Trump needs to enact a national lockdown, contain the spread of the virus as extreme and quickly as possible, to salvage any hope of getting through this without complete destruction. I am calmly writing this: we are in a possible doomsday scenario, Ackman is not exaggerating.\n\nPositions:\n\nShorts: Spy puts 220 Mar 27, LVS puts 35 Mar 27, Buy EDZ outright (emerging markets triple leveraged bear).\n\nLongs: KGC, GOLD, JNUG, September and beyond horizon\n\nTLDR: The American Economy collapses if it doesn't enact the most extreme measure to contain the virus, so dip your toes hoping Trump does the right thing, and it's the app", "created_utc": 1584569081.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fky6rm/you_have_to_understand_the_reasoning_ackman_was/", "is_self": true}
