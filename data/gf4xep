They say \u201cset your stop losses tight, get out if it goes against you two ticks and move on.\u201d This is a glue-guzzling retarded thing to say and I\u2019m about to tell you why. \n\nBefore you say \u201cOh they\u2019re professional traders, they know what they\u2019re talking about,\u201d do me a favor and shut the fuck up. This is the market that\u2019s on it\u2019s way to ATH. These traders don\u2019t know jack shit. We\u2019ve seen companies do the exact opposite of what they should do. STNG came out and made earnings their bitch and lost 10% in one day because the algos saw a downward dog trendline and a negative 50SMA. HOG came out and said they have no customers, no money, and no idea when they\u2019ll make money again and they popped 20%. \n\nIf you start with an account of $1000 and make a stupid play, you might lose 80%. Say you invested in literally anything on march 23rd. However, if you decided to be retarded like Warren Buffett and sell at rock bottom, you would have a portfolio that\u2019s worth 20% of what you started with. Why not sell and move into a different play? Because for you to take that $200 back to $1000, you would need 500% gains in a comparable amount of time as it would take for your original security to recover. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no chance that the original security will recover fully!\u201d Fucking wrong. Unless it\u2019s Luckin Coffee or some other radioactive dogshit, we\u2019ve seen time and again that stocks are only gonna go straight fuckin up for the next infinity years. Long after humans are gone algos are gonna be trading the last securities back and forth with digital money. \n\n\u201cThis is WSB, options or ban.\u201d Someone rack this faggot. I\u2019ve been on WSB for years and shares have always been part of the play. Especially right now, with IV insanely high, option premiums are through the roof and nothing is moving the way you expect it to. Buy shares in something with a low RSI, wait till it pops, and sell that shit. If it goes down, pretend its fucking bitcoin and hold it. \n\n If you wanna bitch and moan about only making 30% on a play, go to your all-time record on Robinhood and remind yourself that you\u2019re down 94% all time and you would suck a bleeding hobo dick for 10% gains. Take your favorite lipstick and write \u201cYOU ARE NOT FUCKING SMART ENOUGH FOR A TEN BAGGER\u201d on your mirror until you learn to walk away from the table with 15% in a week. \n\n\nTL;DR buy shares, hold them till they go up, sell them, repeat. If they don\u2019t go up, don\u2019t fucking sell them, and maybe your kids will sell for a gain. \n\nPositions: STNG, DHT, GLOG, UIS, INFY, MPLX.", "created_utc": 1588851612.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gf4xep/why_its_not_a_loss_until_you_sell_is_2020s_yolo/", "is_self": true}
