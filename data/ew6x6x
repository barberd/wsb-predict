But at this point, when you\u2019ve become domesticated and lost all your natural instincts, my \u2764\ufe0f hurts when you hurt.\n\nAnd you\u2019re gonna hurt, so I\u2019m trying to train you a bit, to save you from yourselves (whether or not you deserve it).\n\nMost days I\u2019m a \ud83d\udc02, some days I\u2019m a \ud83e\uddf8, and for weeks at a time I\u2019m a fuckin \ud83d\ude48 theta gangsta drinkin\u2019 \ud83e\udd43 and planning \ud83c\udfd6 vacations with my gain$.\n\nTesla is trading on forward guidance almost exclusively. Sentiment rules the Trump era market. Tesla will not crash to 0, but the reality is that the coronavirus is going to destroy Q1 earnings. US electric car subsidies have ended, and subsidies around the world are being strained since Tesla\u2019s sales exploded around the world in the last year.\n\nB-B-But Tesla isn\u2019t a car company! It\u2019s a revolutionary disruptor for technology! It\u2019s the next Amazon! I\u2019m gonna tell you right now - buy ATM Amazon calls (or debit call spreads if you can\u2019t afford straight calls) because they\u2019re gonna blow guidance for this year outta the water \ud83d\udcc8 with their taking over the Logistics sector, taking probably all of FedEx market share.\n\nTesla is capital intensive, and has relied on hype and creative financial engineering to support this incredible rally. I salute them, and all you fucking morons who made some money. You wanna be a real G tho? Then you want to make money off options every year. And the way to do that is to inverse your own, dumb, first-thing-that-comes-to-my-mind plays.\n\nIf you wanna lose it like Enron \ud83d\udcc9 be my guest. But I\u2019d say pick a number in line with your \u2018tistic-selves , like $420. It\u2019s already ridiculous.\n\nFuck you I don\u2019t care. \ud83d\udd95", "created_utc": 1580397509, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ew6x6x/4_the_of_god_take_your_profits_on_tsla/", "is_self": true}
