I want some feedback. \n\nSo in the middle of November while watching the VIX get absolutely smashed every single risk free Friday... given all the global uncertainty (trade earnings etc) and with record short VIX positions I played the contrarian. I have been following the VIX for some time. And understand the significant decay associated with many of the inverse products. \n\nI bought 100-shares TVIX @7.18 \n\nFast forward today. On Monday. I received an email from Robinhood that it was doing a reverse 10 to 1 split. And that I would get 1 share for every ten I had (greeeeeeat less possibility of gains). But I understand these products are designed to go to zero and in subsequent weeks to my purchase the vix continue to get smashed. Well I got the volatility pop on Tuesday with low US PMI numbers. However the pop wasn\u2019t that big just really enough to break even. So I\u2019m curious WSB.....\n\nHOW DO YOU GUYS TRADE THE VIX?!? \n\nAre you using inverse related products?  are you shorting with options?  what ETFs are you tracking?  \n\nI\u2019m really interested in hearing how you guys trade (or yolo) IV AND What options are best suited for swing trades or SHORT VIX positions. \n\nBest of luck searching for the next trade boys!", "created_utc": 1575588300, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e6pn8f/trading_the_vix/", "is_self": true}
