It was a disaster, actually. I was grieving my Spy $220p 4/9. Sick to my stomach with worry about my Msft $220c 4/9. Oodles of debt. Minimal tendies...at times no tendies. Things seemed bleak, and I reached the bottom when Derek left my wife. As much as it feels like it is, the break up is not my fault. It is a decision two grown-up people have made between themselves because their relationship was making them feel sadder than happier. So I decided to make myself happier and focus on tendies.\n\nMy personal development work had been spotty at best, and my misery really kicked things up a notch. I knew something had to change. There was a part of me that believed things could change, and that's all you need to start. I lose money when I buy puts; I lose money when I buy calls, so what else is left there?\n\nso I am going all-in on the last plan I can come up with which is: buying a call and a put on the same stock long term (the french gay people call that \\*a hedge\\*)\n\npositions:\n\nLK $3 put 01/21/22\n\nLK $10 call 01/15/21\n\nAnd clearly, things will work out. I am going to be green for sure; I can already feel the Tremendous tendies tickling the hair in my butt\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTD; LR: Just like Jpow prints money, I will print Tendies!", "created_utc": 1586366360.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxakbw/trying_it_all/", "is_self": true}
