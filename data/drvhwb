You're the meme now.", "selftext": "Ever since CTN posted about infinite leverage, a steady stream of you retards has piled in and proceeded to simply lose $2k+ in principal, with the potential of owing Robinhood tens of thousands of dollars without realizing how margin or leverage works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the real beauty in this. The real irony is that every time one of you faggots does this, an email is dispatched company-wide with the subject, \"They're giving us free money\" and the body has your trades and in bold quotation it says, \"we literally can't go tits up\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWTF are you people doing? The whole point of this sub is to highlight good plays, while making memes out of the terrible plays, but every infinite margin hero going forward wanted to get it to make a dog shit play they would inevitably lose regardless. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYOU CAN'T ALL BE MEMES.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**KNOCK IT THE FUCK OFF.**", "created_utc": 1572936232, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/drvhwb/congrats_youre_the_meme_now/", "is_self": true}
