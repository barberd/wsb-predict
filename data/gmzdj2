Bet on millennials and their pent up stimulus & unemployment tendies. \u2708\ufe0f\ud83c\udfe8", "selftext": "Airport traffic is picking up, hotel reservations are increasing regionally. Inbred rednecks could care less about Covid. Between them and Millenials, that\u2019s 50% of the population that either does not give a shit about Covid or has a tendency to YOLO their money on experiences (travel) not assets (fleshlights, etc.). \n\nA large majority of that \u201cpent up demand\u201d from stimulus checks and unemployment (people making $1000/week for not doing shit, more than they were making at their job) are going to be spent on travel to take advantages of cheap hotel/destination prices. Peope are going absolutely stir crazy all day and when they get out, they don\u2019t want to go to their local mall and eat California pizza kitchen, they want to travel - Mexico, Europe, Vegas, Asia, etc. \n\nWith oil being cheap, you better believe airlines are taking advantage on future oil contracts. Hotels will offer discounts for a while, and people will travel. In addition, people want to go see family, their mistresses, they want to get out. Travel industry is going to recover a lot faster then people are predicting.\n\nAll the good value out there is gone. FAANG stocks are already nearing their ATH\u2019s again, and other growth plays already recovered as well. You can make 10-15%/year with those plays at low risk, or make 30-40%/year with travel stocks at medium risk. \n\nWait for the next dip and yolo travel stocks and watch that demand come back quickly. It will. People need to travel. And corpaorte travel will come back as well too - way too many affairs and abuse of expense reports happening on business trips to stop corporate travel.\n\nHere are the plays (wait for next dip):\nDelta\nUnited \nSouthwest\nMarriott\nHilton\nHyatt \n\nStay away from casino stocks, cruise stocks as they will be held down longer, and stay away from shitty airlines like American and Spirit. \n\nUnleash the autist comments.", "created_utc": 1589929104.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gmzdj2/here_me_out_airlinehotel_stocks_are_the_best/", "is_self": true}
