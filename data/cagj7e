My thoughts are we see it test previous resistance around $338 but crawl back up towards $350 towards EOW. Probably will hold off selling another PUT just in case this cancellation inspires any other airlines to do the same. That said, whether it comes in next few days or next few months, likely more cancellations to come.  Still long term Boeing bullish.", "created_utc": 1562560501, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cagj7e/boeing_order_cancelled/", "is_self": true}
