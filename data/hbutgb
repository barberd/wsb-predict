{"id": "hbutgb", "title": "PSA: Withdraw your goddam gains", "selftext": "Ok, I'm sick and tired of seeing all this loss porn of people who were up by what to any average human would be a LIFE CHANGING amount of money, I'm talking 10k, 20k, 30k, even 100 or 200k, and then they lose it all.\n\nStop getting fucking greedy and WITHDRAW! \n\nGet it through your head, if you went up that high once, chances are you can do it again, but you'll probably lose a lot along the way, so would you rather lose 5k of 50k, or 50k having started with 5k? Withdraw your gains!!!!!\n\nBuy a house or a car or give your mom some money or buy your wife's boyfriend a nice big cockring for when he's doing loud yoga with her in your bed. \n\nThis shit will fuck you up. If you make 40 or 50k a year from your job, making 10 or 20k will change your fucking life, but equally losing 20k when you could have changed your life? Devastating. Life shattering. \n\nI say this because I've withdrawn over 30k from RH, but this week I made 10k and then proceeded to lose about 20k, likely with more losses to come at open. But you know what? I can never lose the money that I FUCKING TOOK OUT and my All Time will NEVER show me negative.\n\nWithdraw your fucking gains, bois, pigs get slaughtered!", "created_utc": 1592544322.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hbutgb/psa_withdraw_your_goddam_gains/", "is_self": true}
