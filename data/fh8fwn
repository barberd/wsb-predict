This person had meetings at  10 Downing St.  They met, talked, etc and shook hands w all UK PM Staff.  PM staff recently tested positive for Beer Virus and Trump just spoke that banned all travel to / from Europe but did NOT ban Travel from UK.  The UK PM STAFF has Beer Virus so chances are rank and file have it as well.\n\nHere\u2019s someone in U.K. Staff that has been sick since Friday. \n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/10/coronavirus-latest-updates-us-markets-set-to-pop-as-trump-eyes-stimulus.html\n\nMy Friend met w Staff THIS week.  That person (not the one is this article) recently called them to say they tested positive for Beer Virus.\n\nSince flights to / from U.K. are NOT Banned, this Virus has a leak, and that leak is the U.K.  it will only get much, much, much, worse.\n\nThis person (20 year old millennial) flew back from Italy in 1st class and tested positive.  \n\nhttps://m.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/coronavirus-case-harris-montgomery-flight-italy-15121047.php\n\nShe flew back March 3rd lunchtime after flying through Frankfurt.  Articles came out today to find the other 20 people in her first class cabin.  All roaming around Houston for 8 days now!\n\nThis Travel Ban is toooo late and allowing the U.K. to still be a beer virus leak will only put America at further risk.\n\n$ AAL 4/17 15P\n$ SPY 4/17 270P\n$ SPY 4/17 260P\n\nTLDR: UK is a floating Beer Virus Petri dish and Trump didn\u2019t ban travel to / from there.
