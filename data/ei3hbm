What to short? Why retail of course! Amazon is killing retail! Malls are turning into zombie death zones! Everyone is broke! No one buys things anymore! This is free $$ for me!!\n\nSo I look at higher end retailers, cause betting on the likelyhood of rich people not buying things is super smart right? I check out Nordstrom, trading at $30 and change. I see I can get $30 puts, for JANUARY, for $2.64! Sold, I'm in, that is super mispriced I'm a financial genius. Click click click, lets go watch Nordstrom fall and collect my money!\n\n\nHere's Nordstrom stock chart from Oct to today: https://imgur.com/MjF5fth\n\nHere's my account balance graph from the same time period: https://imgur.com/3Q7Kuod\n\nHere's the current value of my can't miss option: https://imgur.com/5kqGCzc\n\nSo anyone got any tips on how to crater Nordstom 30% in a month?
