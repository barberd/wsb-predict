{"id": "czmqqg", "title": "Lulu a technical analysis", "selftext": "Summary: Lulu is going up after earnings but with limited upside. Condor play might actually work.\n\nNext week options have 80% IV\n\nPast three candles on dailies have provided a bearish setup, however, intraday momentum does not match.\n\nIntraday momentum is at a super low however, there is super low liquidity in the market. This usually leads to a melt up on low volume.\n\nLulu bands are currently at 175 and 187 on dailies\n168 and 191 on the weeklies.\n\nWith an ATH at 194, I do not think there will be enough volume for Lulu to break the upper band. Even if intraday momentum spikes tomorrow, the earnings play will be limited.", "created_utc": 1567612569, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/czmqqg/lulu_a_technical_analysis/", "is_self": true}
