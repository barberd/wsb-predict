{"id": "cc4nde", "title": "On a real note", "selftext": "When will Donatello tweet about Beyond Meat? When you consider that fact that:\n\nA) Farmers mostly support Republicans and are always directly promised to. They are also used to promote the Republicans in their advertisements.\n\nB) They are struggling with the trade war, decrease domestic demand, high debt and environmental issues like the massive flooding in the Midwest.\n\nC) Consumer taste is shifting and they can't adapt because of how the meat industry works. Those expensive equipments, houses etc... won't pay for themselves you know. Ikea just released non-meat hot dogs that costly less than the meat version. I also keep getting ads by various companies offering non-meat burgers. Major food companies are now investing to start up their own non-meat patties. \n\nDoante Trumpoo can totally help the meat industry imo. Think about it, if he tweets about buying meat products because it's patriotic, is helping out the farmers and disses BYND, his retarded followers are going to buy every meat available with money from cash loan companies. Pork, beef, chicken, possum, chihuahua etc..\n\nBest part is those followers will take to twitter to showcase what they bought, encourage others to do the same. The Anti-Trump group doesn't care.", "created_utc": 1562896729, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cc4nde/on_a_real_note/", "is_self": true}
