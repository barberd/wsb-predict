People are freaking the fuck out and I don't think that will end soon.\n\nThat being said, I do still see this as a potential buying opportunity but long term calls definitely. Maybe even only as early as next year though.\n\nWe should rally together and see what plays can be made right now that are actual realistic. All the golds are at ATH so you don't want to just bet on gold and then burned.\n\nWe have this $GILD that sounds like gold but apparently could fix beer flu.\n\n\nTL;DR We need to all step back and see what the good short term plays are because the long term ones will come with almost everything because of the massive recovery we will see this year.", "created_utc": 1582552496, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f8rj6g/dont_just_buy_the_dip/", "is_self": true}
