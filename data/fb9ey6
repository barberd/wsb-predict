{"id": "fb9ey6", "title": "Invest in something else (day 2)", "selftext": "Hey, I know people are here to make more cash than they already have, I want to share with you the way I do it. I'm living from betting on matches. I spend thousands of hours each year to make proper research about bets I made and it is profitable each month. I've made it since 2010 and sharing my picks on Twitter since two months. We already made there over 75% of my starting bankroll. It's pretty huge in two months I believe and you have bigger control about your budget. I will share here one pick each day, the rest of them you can find on Twitter. Hope you enjoy.\n\nYesterday we won our first, now we are getting second one.\n\n**Record 1:0**\n\n**Last POTD:**  **Natus Vincere ML** vs. Liquid WIN\n\n**Todays POTD: G2 ML** vs. Fnatic\n\n**Sport:** CS:GO - IEM Katowice\n\n**Time:** 15:00 CET\n\n**Odds:** 1.6\n\nPretty confident on that pick, if you followed my Twitter you could catch that on 1.9 odds yesterday. G2 practiced a lot before IEM Katowice and they are on good form to fight against Astralis in final. Fnatic is shaky form, winning rounds mostly based on aim, not tactics. G2 made great win against Liquid and Fnatic won their match against 100T in tough fight. G2 are similar in skillwise with Fnatic, but they have much better tactics and bigger map pool.\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/fooxiedtips) \\- much more daily picks.\n\n[Discord](https://discord.gg/udp68cg) \\- come and say Hi!", "created_utc": 1582963133, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fb9ey6/invest_in_something_else_day_2/", "is_self": true}
