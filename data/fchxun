{"id": "fchxun", "title": "Shorting Robinhood", "selftext": "So RH has been a disaster this morning, which can be catastrophic for the company in long term. Many of us wonder how can we short this company. I just found out that RH is trading publicly under ticker, wait for it, $RH. So there, they are still in the green today, so it seems like the market is irrational again. I would suggest to buy puts on $RH. You can check wikipedia on what put is, I think it\u2019s a very safe investment.
