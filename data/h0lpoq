More importantly, the RSI is now down to 25 (i.e. significantly underbought), which I assume is due to the recent intense market rally and JPow's brrrrrr. Looking at the last 10-15 years, DXY's RSI has only been this low on 3-4 occasions, and it quickly jumped up significantly shortly after on all those occasions. Now, given that everytime DXY goes up, SPY drops, I'm expecting a 5-10% market correction over the next week or two as DXY's RSI returns to normal. Is this a safe assumption?
