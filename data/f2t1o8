Technically I'm an SDR, so I'm not making the sale, but I'm setting meetings for Account Executives.\n\nThey're sending me out to an event this Spring and had me request a corporate AMEX card. It just arrived, let's goooo. My question is, how can I transfer money from my corp card to RH, and about how much is reasonable?\n\nOf course, I need to make it look like it's legit. Any way to make the money look like it's for a flight/dinner or something similar.\n\n(edit: marked as Shitpost because my original flare of discussion had my post removed)", "created_utc": 1581522133, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f2t1o8/transfer_money_from_corp_amex_to_robinhood/", "is_self": true}
