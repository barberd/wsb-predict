{"id": "gm5uo7", "title": "W Shaped Recovery", "selftext": "Alright before I start this semi-rant/discussion. A serious \u201cFuck you\u201d to all the people posting about Uber cutting jobs and the share price pumping. How fucking stupid are you people that you dont at least scroll through WSB before posting shit thats been posted about 10 times already. I digress. \n\n\nhttps://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/coronavirus-v-shaped-recovery-uncertain-el-erian\n\nIn the link above, this guy El-Erian, a well accomplished economist, has emphasized on the fact that there is a high level of uncertainty. This is obvious as fuck. But he uses the metaphor of a pendulum and that the market is moving towards equilibrium. Point is that he says this \u201crecovery\u201d will look more like a W rather than a V and this has been pretty blatant over the past month with SPY looking like a fucking heart rate monitor. Now more than ever it seems a little easier to time the market. Long term, yea I 100% believe we will get those beautiful circuit breakers. For now JPow is king but Puts are a viable option when SPY pops over 3% in one day. Please discuss. \n\nPositions: Sold SBUX & LOW calls this morning for nice gain. Will be waiting EOD for SPY 290p 6/1\n\nTLDR:  Stop throwing your life savings at puts thinking the next circuit breaker is tomorrow morning. Having some discipline doesnt make you a fucking pussy. Its all gambling regardless and youre gay no matter what. And fuck you everyone posting about Uber. No one cares.", "created_utc": 1589822742.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gm5uo7/w_shaped_recovery/", "is_self": true}
