{"id": "f2e95u", "title": "DD for Nutrien. Get in on this for some easy tendies.", "selftext": "So here's the deal autists, Nutrien, a fertilizer company. Has had money locked up for the past two quarters due to a series of Acquisitions and mergers that they've been doing to consolidate the PotAsh Market and Chemical sales market for Agriculture in the United States. These silly bastards have acquired 70% of the international PotAsh Market and have what is effectively a monopoly on the U.S Market.   \nTheir earnings for the last 2 quarters have been dog shit due to them buying up other companies and investing in long term capital improvements to increase efficiencies, but these guys are about to skyrocket (well at least to $50.00 probably). Their earnings are coming up February 18th and I fully expect them to beat out their Expected EPS.   \n\n\nThe play? March 27th $45.00 calls are going for $.90/share right now. I'm buying as soon as my ACH transfer hits my TD Ameritrade account.
