{"id": "bceyxx", "title": "Your Chance to Become an Oil Baron", "selftext": "Things are getting spicy(er) in the oil market. I've been long oil since about mid-December, but in my opinion the geopolitical risks are really starting to heat up, and the recent uncertainty leaves me at a crossroads. If the factors play out as below, the price of oil could moon, but outcomes are far from certain meaning this thing could get choppy and trade sideways for a while. That being said, my suggestions are somewhat of a YOLO trade to capture the potential upside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThings I'm more certain of/things we already know:\n\nFor domestic oil inventories we should start to see significant inventory draws as crack spreads have widened, which should increase refinery utilization rates, and the spill in the Houston ship channel has been cleaned up allowing exports to increase from recent weeks. US production is still high (12.2M bpd), however we saw a 90K bpd reduction in output in January, a surprise slowdown. Further, rig counts tracked by Baker Hughes, which tracks active drilling rigs putting in new wells, has dropped by a total of 50 for the year. However, drilled but uncompleted wells (DUCs) are still numerous, so it'd be bold to point to this as a sure sign of slowing US production. Lastly, we just began driving season (Apr-Sept), which will increase demand here in the states.\n\nSupply continues to tighten, and the demand fears we have been seeing since BOY have alleviated quickly (something I think has been overlooked). The most glaring catalyst in the market has been the OPEC+ cuts of 1.2M bpd, most notably Saudi Arabia who has cut more than they originally promised, bringing actual cuts to over 1.5M bpd in March. On top of that, Venezuela is getting fucked by U.S. sanctions, political turmoil, as well as problems with their power grid causing blackouts and therefore dramatic production decreases. As it stands they are producing 600M bpd less than they did last year. It's still tbd to see what happens with the Iranian waivers, which I'll touch on more below. Overall, the global supply/demand picture is balanced to slightly restricted as of now. Opinions on supply and demand moving forward vary quite dramatically and projecting oil S/D in this environment is essentially a guessing game. Below are good examples of why projections are so hard to figure. These are also factors I see having the most impact on prices moving forward.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe question marks:\n\n1. Recently, Libyan oil production of over 900K bpd has been essentially reduced to a coin flip. With them being on the verge of a renewed civil war, a huge risk to the supply side is up in the air. It's hard to see things between the two sides working themselves out anytime soon, so the question is will the opposition target oil fields, pipelines, etc. to financially hinder the other side. It was reported today that the Saudi government offered financial support to the aggressor, Khalifa Haftar, which he accepted.\n2. Iran export waivers. This one is a catch-22 for the Trump administration. On one hand, he has been trying to bring oil prices down one tweet at a time. On the other, he wants Iranian exports to go to zero. He can't have both. If he ends the waiver program, disallowing countries to buy Iran crude, this would be a considerable hit to the supply side and therefore pressure prices higher. The waivers are set to expire early may if no extension is granted. Sec. of Energy Rick Perry and others have called for them to expire, the Trump administration has demurred.\n3. OPEC meeting on June 25. Up until this point, Saudi Arabia has been vocal about wanting to extend OPEC cuts through the end of 2019. Russia, on the other hand, has been less enthusiastic. If Libyan production disappears and Iran gets eighty-sixed from the export market, I could see production cuts coming to an end. We will get more transparency as time passes as Saudi Arabia has been wont to do in previous run-ups to these meetings, but still tbd.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want it to be said that I believe oil should continue to climb as any one of these factors playing out in favor of the bulls should have a significant impact on the supply side. However, I was much more confident in a normal long position back in December. Now, I'm looking to capture the potential upside with an emphasis on options and a modest long position. Love em or hate em, OPEC makes things easier in this market IMO. Saudi has been in \"do whatever it takes mode\" (their words) to raise prices and they need \\~$85 Brent to balance their budget. The trend is your friend here. For me I look to sell my options end of June at the latest. A lot will happen between now and then, so it will be time to digest and re-assess at that point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy trade:\n\n**USO calls for 19 Jul 19**\n\n**Strike: 14.5**\n\nA little less risky:\n\n**USO calls for 8 Oct 19**\n\n**Strike: 14.5**\n\nPersonally, I am doing a combination of both with a long position on the side. I'm new to DD, so all feedback welcome. GL", "created_utc": 1555083423, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bceyxx/your_chance_to_become_an_oil_baron/", "is_self": true}
