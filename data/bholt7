{"id": "bholt7", "title": "$EA Option Volume and Thoughts", "selftext": "Hey all, so I know EA has a love/hate relationship here on Reddit and on WSB these past few months with the current price action. This stock has been hit hard recently. I'm writing this because I noticed that option volume for the 6/21 chain, namely the 110C and 130C is way higher than OI. 110C is 2630 Volume of 8536 OI, and 130C is 7208 Volume of 6609 OI.\n\nNow, with earnings on 5/7/19, historically they have gained the past couple years on this quarter. Do I think they will be 130 by June? Hell no, unless Apex somehow makes half a bil (I think it will be ~$260 mil). Just not sure where this volume is coming from. Any thoughts?\n\nI heard Apex made over $90 million on the first month ([link](https://www.dexerto.com/apex-legends/apex-legends-record-breaking-revenue-profit-fortnite-money-474448) through in game purchases and while I think 110 is attainable, 130 by June isn't. Personally, I think EPS will beat and revenues will be in line or low, but their guidance will raise due to Apex's popularity and future seasons as well as the new Star Wars game coming out later this year. I am forecasting peak Apex playerbase coming in around 63 mil, though it undoubtedly has stabilized lower but EA will never say. Anthem is pretty much going the way of Andromeda and dying, possibly taking down Bioware with it; though I am confident they sold a lot of copies initially. Also, EA's subscription service is actually pretty good. I tried it for a month, and you get a bunch of free games, free trials on new games, as well as 10% off on nearly everything (including in game purchases *cough* Fifa packs *cough*). I also believe in sorefreshing's DD on the company and longer dated options (6/21 or even 9/20s) would be a good play here. \n\n**Voodoo Technical Palm Readings Below**\n\n&gt;$EA's RSI is 43.93 currently and volatility on options is not high (36-39 IV for 6/21 option chains) and the MACD is converging currently so the downward trend should be nearly over. Volume has been, on average, decreasing the past week or so as well. I think we are due for some solid support going into earnings.\n\nLet me know what you guys think. I currently do have options (6/21 100C, 105C, 110C) on EA that I bought too early and down ~50% on. Though I will probably double down on my 6/21 100Cs with another 5k or so.\n\n**TLDR; EA has potential to not fuck up for once and generate profits and good will with the gaming community. Earnings on companies have mainly been about guidance and I believe they will go up due to raising guidance. Sentiment is low for this stock, options are cheap.**", "created_utc": 1556297708, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bholt7/ea_option_volume_and_thoughts/", "is_self": true}
