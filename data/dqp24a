Currently at trading at about 22.50 up 16% from October 23rd. \n\nSince this is WSB, I\u2019ll soon get the point where I see an opportunity for big $$$\n\nThe Real Real is a luxury consignment platform where they have sellers selling their used luxury goods, to buyers in the market. There are similar companies like Farfetch but REAL seems to be more for the used goods market. (Gig economy) They don\u2019t own any products but \u201cverify authenticity\u201d on goods that people sell to other buyers since heavily sold items are usually luxury handbags and goods. \n\nI see this can be a scalable opportunity for the company but having looked into customer reviews it seems there are tons of complaints on goods that are \u201cfake\u201d etc. This got me thinking, some goods don\u2019t have their box or receipt and you are technically trusting that the company has done their due diligence. Even if you purchased a product from the company, how can they stop people from selling Grade A fakes passing it off with a receipt and box? \n\nScanning through some customer reviews, \u201cfake\u201d items or items that were received but are completely different than what was posted seem to be the current narrative. Also, trying to reach customer service on refunds and returning items seem to be a huge pain in the ass. I can also see how this could be a huge issue for REAL since it is up to their platform to \u201cauthenticate\u201d all these goods. \n\nThe current CEO  of REAL is Julie Wainwright who ran Pets.com and probably was one of the shortest run IPO ever and we know that was a huge flop.\n\nFarfetch is a similar ecommerce site that sells luxury brands for a discount but FTCH is currently trading at 8 dollars from its 20 dollar IPO price as well. FTCH does have more shares out than REAL but is also not completely focused on the \u201cused\u201d goods market. \n\nGoing from what we\u2019ve seen so far from ecommerce type companies this year including PINS, FTCH, I\u2019m seeing this as an opportunity to short the shit out of this one. \n\nYes Burberry announced a partnership with REAL, but this seems to already be priced in from the recent movements. \n\nAlso another important point here is that Jim Cramer has been bigly bullish on REAL, and doing the inverse of him usually pans out well.\n\n\nAnyone give me a reason why I shouldn\u2019t short the shit out of this one come monday?", "created_utc": 1572722788, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dqp24a/the_real_real_real_real_deal_or_flop_on_monday/", "is_self": true}
