I use IB and so does my friend, and we both can't pull up any charts for any ticker. Other brokerages are facing \"issues\" where they can't sell. \n\nOn a side note, I noticed various indicators like RSI and chaiken have been acting extremely strange lately. Even if a stock is over sold, it will continue to shoot up. \n\nThis is looking very suspicious imo. Trumps pp team might literally be market manipulation. I'm no expert or anything, but it's a free market, and market manipulation is illegal.", "created_utc": 1584374327.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjn7l0/interactive_brokers_now_also_showing_problems/", "is_self": true}
