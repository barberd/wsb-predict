{"id": "fkno9w", "title": "TSLA Bubble Finally Bursting... As Expected", "selftext": "It's really difficult to find any Tesla charts here lately ... maybe you guys can post some in the comments (: \n\nA flawless sell-off since the highs [I suggested earlier in the year](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/TSLA/JAD051fZ-ridethepig-The-Tesla-Bubble/). TSLA losing 400 pre-market as lack of sizings continue in the bullish flow. Capitulation was the catalyst to go actively short, well done all those that caught it in the diagram below.e. **TSLA** will obviously benefit from the [transition away from an oil driven economy](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/USOIL/llW52K18-ridethepig-Energy-Overbought/), though this move does not reflect normality.  \n\n\nThe risk-off sentiment led to a significant divergence in the surface and inversion in short-interest structure. Initially I am going to run the trade dynamically to position for both a continuation and reversal **\\[check\\]** (in simple words hedging) and then when the trade starts working we can go massive on sizings **\\[check\\]** !\n\n  \n\n\n[TSLA Bubble Bursting](https://preview.redd.it/tlgftexyven41.png?width=2632&format=png&auto=webp&s=119ed69e9afccb83c8902713577d6d841113f3de)\n\nI evaluate the balance sheet path's under different assumptions for the demand. I continue to suggest the metrics are overstretched on both deliverables and PPE spending. **In my models, stock is fairly valued at +/- 258 \\[final target\\]**.[ ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/TSXV-XX/)Initial targets are already cleared (can't believe I am saying this) of 650 **\\[check\\]** and 550 **\\[check\\]**. If we get enough interest in the comments we can explore TSLA's financial status and short-interest resilience to date.\n\n  \nAs usual thanks for keeping the likes, comments and etc coming!  \n\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/TSLA/JAD051fZ-ridethepig-The-Tesla-Bubble/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/TSLA/JAD051fZ-ridethepig-The-Tesla-Bubble/)", "created_utc": 1584528847.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkno9w/tsla_bubble_finally_bursting_as_expected/", "is_self": true}
