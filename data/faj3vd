DD in post.", "selftext": "Hear me out, Carnival is going down right now in Brasil ( I know thats not how you spell in in the US, but that's how *Brazilians* spell it). If you have never been to Brasil in Carnival - you are in for a treat of a story.   \n\n\nIts literally the biggest shit show for over 7 days straight. I mean Partying until 4 am and waking up at 10 am to do it all over. Since its summertime there - people are wearing almost nothing, they are getting close and rubbing to dance *forro* or *funk within the float parties..  IF* you aren't at work do yourself a favor and youtube Brazilians dancing to funk.. Not only that but Carnival is for the young, drunk and beautiful.. I kid you not people are having sex in the street making out with multiple people all-day. Granted we don't know how this virus works in a hotter climate, but I mean if poppa Trump says it's going to be gone in the US due to warmer weather.. then you may not want to make this play.   \n\n\nThey have already dropped because the Bovespa is closed this whole time ( Brazilian stock market) due to Carnival... When this thing opens after this weekend amid fears from all over the world.. I think this tanks into the 35ish range. I myself have a little pp and bought only 4 contracts of 4/17 $38p this morning.. Wishing I had bought more, but hey- I need to start somewhere.  \n\n\nAnd if you don't believe any of this DD.. Just look at my username you autists..  \n\n\nTurn to the side of the bears... the gay bears.   \n\n\nCheers.", "created_utc": 1582838190, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/faj3vd/story_time_ewz_puts_load_up_dd_in_post/", "is_self": true}
