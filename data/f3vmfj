I don\u2019t know whether to sell or hold, but i\u2019m here, so I may as well hold until expiration. I need some god damn tendies. No, not the wholesale tendies, i\u2019m talking the slow roasted, succulent tendies. \n\nYOLO, ALL IN $SPCE. YOU EITHER COMING TO SPACE OR WAITING FOR THE APOCALYPSE HERE ON EARTH.\n\nEither way, i\u2019m not sharing my tendies.  My dick is fucking huge after these gains, i\u2019m talking 3 whole inches. Ya\u2019ll need to catch up.", "created_utc": 1581701833, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3vmfj/spce_to_moon/", "is_self": true}
