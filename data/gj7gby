[The country's COVID-19 situation is on the brink of destroying an economy that is already in the fucking gutter](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/05/brazil-coronavirus-hot-spot-bolsonaro/611401/) because of idiocy and corruption on a scale that would make the fucking Illuminati blush ([\"Operation Car Wash\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Car_Wash), I can't make this hit up). The big booty hoes and the Neymar-looking fuckboys in Brazil REFUSE to stay the fuck inside because they can't go a day without getting fucking each other and getting AIDS. It also doesn't help that Brazil's president believes that, because he apparently used to be a [Michael Jordan-level Herculean athlete](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2Fjair-bolsonaro-far-right-trump-13799820&psig=AOvVaw1ocEHVxQ3zdt8eO_wyfo_o&ust=1589489043609000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCOiksqTasekCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAQ), the virus will be as harmful to him as a punch from someone on this subreddit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what the fuck does this have to do with PAGS?? Well, as the company states, they provide financial solution to individuals, micro-merchants, and MSBs and SSBs. What businesses do you think are gonna be wiped the fuck out when the economy tanks?? YOU FUCKING GUESSED IT, the entire customer base of this company. They are fucked. Positions in comments.\n\nPAGS 8/21 15P\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Short PAGS. Their entire customer base will be disproportionately affected by beer flu. Covid will fuck Brazil harder than a JPOW green dildo. (EWZ could be a good short too).", "created_utc": 1589402957.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gj7gby/short_idea_pags/", "is_self": true}
