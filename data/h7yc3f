{"id": "h7yc3f", "title": "Why the Hertz rally suddenly makes perfect sense. HTZ 11c September", "selftext": "Hertz, a ***bankrupt company***, just rallied 30% today after announcing its intention to ***dilute*** its current shareholders to raise cash.\n\nThis shouldn't be happening, you say? Autistic Robinhooders playing hold my bags until the inevitable plummet to 0, you say?\n\n**Not necessarily.** In reality Hertz may have set in a motion a series of events that could just let it cruise out of bankruptcy and soar way above the current share price.\n\nAnd this is how. According to Bloomberg:\n\n***\" Several sets of unsecured Hertz bonds soared after the ruling, with the 5.5% notes due 2024 jumping almost 13 cents on the dollar to 48.5 cents -- their best level in almost two months \"***\n\nSo basically, by getting permission to sell its bankrupt shares to raise cash, Hertz has become ***considerably more attractive to future lenders.*** The only reason why it's in bankruptcy in the first place is **because they couldn't find anyone to lend money to them.**\n\nSo this is what happens. When a company's borrowing costs (bond yields) **decrease**, its share price **increases** as a general rule. So to put it into perspective:\n\nHTZ shares rally---> borrowing costs decrease --->HTZ shares rally as a result ----> borrow costs decrease----->repeat and recycle.\n\nWhen HTZ was above $5.00 the bond markets (lenders) gave no fucks. HTZ is bankrupt, they said, they're not allowed to sell their shares anyway, they said, it's against the rules and it's never been done before. **Well guess what? The courts just decided they can. They keep on getting away with it**\n\nAnd so on and so forth. Could all shareholders be wiped out? Yes, there's a decent possibility. But if Hertz can somehow take advantage of both the equity and bond markets, it could conceivably just roll over its debt, get out of bankruptcy relatively scott free and ***become a much more efficient business in the aftermath. This has never been done before. We are in uncharted territory.***\n\nGood luck, fellow autists.", "created_utc": 1592013813.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h7yc3f/why_the_hertz_rally_suddenly_makes_perfect_sense/", "is_self": true}
