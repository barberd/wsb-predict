Send a copy of that statement along with your TDA account number to their customer service email, and they will credit you the $75. Easy!\n\nGotta love great customer service.", "created_utc": 1583338475, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fdf9x8/just_got_off_the_phone_with_td_ameritrade/", "is_self": true}
