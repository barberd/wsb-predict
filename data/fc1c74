You think that just because the markets have fallen farther than your pants when you're at the urinal (with your shirt tucked under your chin) that it's time to buy the dip?\u00a0  \n\n\nWell that's why you're a smoothed brain retard. we are going to have sustained supply chain disruptions well into Q3 and Q4 that will continue to provide \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b gang with the premium non-generic brand tendies.\u00a0\n\nChina released its Manufacturing PMI on Friday, which was a whopping \\*\\*35.7\\*\\*. For context, the lowest it's ever been was 37.8, and that was during november of 2008. Moreover, the only thing that china is consistently good at is lying about official numbers, so that numbers in reality are most likely closer to 25-30.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-february-manufacturing-pmi-drops-162233535.html  \n\n\nFurthermore, analysts were anticipating that number to be somewhere around 47, but clearly the yoga they have been practicing since new years has gotten them flexible enough to get their heads far enough up their asses to think that quarantining 700 million people in the largest manufacturing country on planet earth would only drop the index by 6-7 points - ie the true consequences of this supply chain disruption hasn't been priced in yet.\u00a0\n\nWhat's the play? any retail that heavily relies on chinese imports. For example, WMT will most likely see the largest hit, as their logistics structures are centered around lean invetory management - meaning that they forecast and order from their vendors every week to keep inventory levels low so they don't waste money on storage and moving unnecessary products. Even if they order enough in large volumes now to get them through the next few months, it will be may-June that they start seeing major disruptions in their product lines because there's nothing coming behind it. And for a retailer that lives on 2-3% margin, they're going to get absolutely ass blasted.\u00a0\n\nIf WSB wants to really vandalize the markets, start compiling lists of retailers and manufactures that rely on chinese goods - and start looking at puts with expirations of June-July.\u00a0", "created_utc": 1583099562, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fc1c74/dd_chinese_manufacturing/", "is_self": true}
