For instance you get 8% maintenance on S&P 500 etfs (12.5x leverage, note: TDA is lame and gives 10%) and similar on bond ETFs. (3x requirement on 3x levered ETFs). HOWEVER most brokers will cross apply fixed correlation offsets, such as a 90% reduction for bonds-s&p500, so a 50% S&P500 50% bond ETF portfolio has maintenance of 0.8% meaning up to 125x leverage is possible up to your PNR - point of no return where your portfolio hits zero and the broker's money is on the hook.\n\nIn practice I used that margin offsetting to put on a 1.5m UPRO and 1.5m TMF position in my 400k portfolio margin account, box spread financed the margin, still had 170k buying power left, and EOD today I'm up to 270k buying power. I stopped at 8x leverage ratio on top of 3x levered etfs.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/UkvbJ2h\n\nAnd that's just retail. I'll spill a very well kept secret breaking NDA of a quant fund I interviewed at: basket options.\n\nBasically on the institutional level funds can buy OTC a basket of securities from a bank for a premium that's designated as all the proceeds of a specified bank proprietary trading account. Then the bank \"hires\" the same hedge fund to trade the account on the banks money and trading systems up to 20x leverage or more. After 366 days the fund exercises/sells the option back to the bank and gets to claim all the gains as long term capital gains subtracting their trading costs from the basket.\n\nPortfolio margin is your chance to have an even foot. Have fun!\n\nEdit: Someone asked me to log into desktop TOS and hit \"Explain Margin\".
