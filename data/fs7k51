{"id": "fs7k51", "title": "Subprime Auto Lending Bubble", "selftext": "There's been a subprime auto lending bubble, ready to burst, for the past 2 years. 'Contract workers' took out loans to purchase cars and 'work' for companies like 'Uber' and 'lyft'. On December 12th of 2019, NPR covered a story about a guy who purchased a 2015 Chrysler for $10k hoping to use that vehicle to earn himself \"$1,500 to $2,000 per week\" in income. The guy in the NPR story (presumably the norm) used a company called \"Credit Acceptance\" ($CCACC) to finance the purchase. So, this guy finds out he agreed to a sale price of $17k with a subprime interest rate of 22.99%. Ipso facto, he agreed to pay $32k paid for a $10k car. Low and behold, the lender \"Credit Acceptance\" also functions as a collections agency. Therefore, this lender reserves the right to repossess the car and recover the deficiency amount. However, since 2019 the New York Legal Assistance Group has been defending consumers from such debtors on grounds of false advertising, deception, fraud, and violations of the federal Truth in Lending Act. https://www.npr.org/2019/12/12/787337997/the-big-business-of-subprime-auto-loans\nTLDR:  Buy puts on CACC", "created_utc": 1585634527.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fs7k51/subprime_auto_lending_bubble/", "is_self": true}
