It\u2019s a limp leaf, today I wanted to share what happens when you don\u2019t have faith. I got in on SPCE with a simple debit spread, or 2 of em\u2019 for like 7/17 and sold them both for profit... them hoes were like 10/12 and 12/14 strike prices so it would be big chillen if I just held... also I was hesitant and didn\u2019t have the cash or balls I do now so I held like 7 shares or some shit (FUCK YOU BRO YEAH I USED TO HOLD SHARES NOW IM GETTING DICKED BY THE KID WHO VOICE MESSAGED ME SAYING HIS DAD WILL BAN ME FROM XBOX) but anyways, I was telling my friends who hardly invest but I got them into it, i was telling my dad, sister, cats, dogs, invisible friends, literally everyone this bitch would go up. It did, my average of like 11.67 or some shit on shares I sold for 18.50 then rebought at 18.69 and sold again at 19 and been leaving alone since cause I\u2019m retarded. \n\nWho cares about the numbers, the lesson here is don\u2019t be a pussy, have faith, and have diamond hands like me and hold 3/20 200c MSFT\n\nThis has been my Ted Talk", "created_utc": 1581715240, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3z02j/some_motivation_to_everyone/", "is_self": true}
