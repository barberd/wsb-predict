{"id": "bzdpn9", "title": "Roast Me again. I am adding to my BYND position.", "selftext": "Today is a crap day. No way to argue otherwise. But I believe the actual short squeeze hasn't happened yet. As of yesterday's data from S3, 49.9% of the shares are still short. When I called Interactive Brokers today, they quoted me 394% to short the stock, up from 165% last night. The IB employee told me it was the highest rate he's ever seen on the platform. There are still NO shares to short. Yes it is overvalued, and yes the stock is down this morning- but I think a squeeze is still inbound. I may be wrong, so please don't follow my lead. I am simply adding a small bit of calls. Not a crazy amount. I am buying August $200 calls. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShorts typically don't get charged for holding intra-day, just overnight. So if I am right, I believe we'll see some covering into the close, maybe a sell-off tomorrow morning, followed by the continued run-up from the squeeze. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust my 2 cents. This is INSANELY RISKY and only buy calls if you A) know what you are doing and B) use a TINY amount of capital because you are likely to lose it all. \n\nI am not an investment advisor and the stock is overvalued. If I am wrong, I am only risking an amount of money I can afford to lose, so please keep that in mind and don't listen to anything I am saying.", "created_utc": 1560265986, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bzdpn9/roast_me_again_i_am_adding_to_my_bynd_position/", "is_self": true}
