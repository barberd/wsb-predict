Hence I chose to buy a 172.5 put and sell a 175 put. Should I choose net credit in the price type and type my limit price (lets just say 0.60) to get a $60 credit/spread?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!", "created_utc": 1557002621, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bkpl80/understanding_put_credit_spread/", "is_self": true}
