{"id": "e797wt", "title": "$PLAY DD", "selftext": "Dave &amp; Busty\u2019s earnings are coming out this week.\n \nFrom going once every month/2 months for the past year, The major change they\u2019ve picked up business wise is ditching their usual coupons that are fed via email in favor of switching everything over to an app on your phone. Now the coupons used to be pretty sweet, the best being a buy $20 of tokens, get $20 free. If the managers are cool, you won\u2019t even need to pay $20 at all, just get $20 worth of free tokens. Now that gravy train appears to have dried up as the only standing offer is \u201c50% off your first purchase of tokens.\u201d\n\nRunning out of tokens? Buy it from your phone, fuck the lines, do it instantly. Great for squeezing out an impulse purchase out of people.\n\nI\u2019d like to remind people that some of these games in these establishments are literal slot machines. And have you seen those kids fucking huddled around screaming their heads off about those massive fish-roulette wheels? Those games aren\u2019t cheap, and when you do hit, hey! Congrats kiddo, those hard-earned tickets will go towards $1 worth of sugary candy and cheap chinese toys bought in batches of $10,000. People come to play and have fun and the people who actually want prizes at the end probably spend a good amount more than their prize is actually worth.\n\nI don\u2019t expect any massive fluctuations. We\u2019ll see how the app-based implementation of their rewards program pans out, but they look as busy as ever - wonder if this will increase profitability based on the ability to reload cards instantly and the absence of their usual deluge of coupons. \n\nCalls are the move but I\u2019d be genuinely surprised if they got anything beyond 5% boost. I\u2019m poor as shit so I\u2019m only playing stocks instead of options. \n\nYadda yadda do your own research and if it goes tits up remember that you listened to some retard on WSB ramble on about an arcade.", "created_utc": 1575689496, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e797wt/play_dd/", "is_self": true}
