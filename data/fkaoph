{"id": "fkaoph", "title": "Holding on to cash", "selftext": "At a time like this, when SPY moves like a penny stock but premiums remain extremely high on both sides of the field, hold cash and wait for the signal. Don't think the \"what ifs\", \"what if I bought puts/calls/ropes\". Just let the market react. Because as much as you want this to go one way, which I'm sure many of you will pick the right side going puts, the opposing side is the feds and WH who are doing everything to prop it up. Stimulating the market with a 1.5 Trillion stimulus failed, then removing bank restrictions to encourage credit lending failed, followed by a 700B stimulus for mortgaged backed securities/bonds that also failed, now in talks of yet another 800B stimulus. Spy is ripping left and right and the only people that are gonna get capsized in all this back and forth are the short term option players. Playing weeklys can prompt panic selling when spy swings +/- 10% on another stimulus/failed stimulus. There really are no patterns to this. Sometimes it goes deep red and the next day is bright green, other days it's bright red and opens bright red. Don't time this market until you see a consistent retrace. Hold the cash. You have plenty of time to get rich on the upside which is inevitable.\n\nEdit:\n\nSeems like people are unhappy about my advice, but here's further rationale. I see this as a period of extreme volatility (use Greeks for reference) and with premiums being so high + record high IV's on the SPY, I don't think it is a good idea to spend profits onto something with so much risk associated. I know a lot of people made money on puts, but really, there's always a serious risk for reversals. In the short term, 2-3 months out, my mind wants to go all in on puts because I expect GDP to suffer, guidance down until 3rd quarter, and consumerism down for a good number of sectors. But even with that in mind, I wouldn't risk the profits that were almost placed straight into my wallet from the puts that I played since late February. That being said, I made plenty. But it's time to be realistic and play safe. Don't throw free money away.", "created_utc": 1584470963.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkaoph/holding_on_to_cash/", "is_self": true}
