I see lots of OI on December 20 calls. Apparently the CEO has also been buying a lot of stock recently. PDFUA is December 24th but it seems like people are betting that run up will be much like other recent adcom meetings that we've seen such as amarin. The drug is for AF. It actually works and it doesn't have any major safety problems. Company has a small market cap so I'm just wondering what people here are doing. FDA will probably have a favorable adcom. Usually, they release documents a couple days before the actual adcom so make sure you buy calls or shares by December 6 just to be safe.", "created_utc": 1574748057, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e1tpxw/corv_december_10_adcom_coming_up_any_plays/", "is_self": true}
