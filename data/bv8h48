Here's why:\n\n1. Tesla is pretty iconic US brand for future auto tech company. Punishing Tesla by banning any Tesla sale and production in China definitely will help Chinese own brand of electric car industry.\n\n2. Tesla financial isnt in good shape. Any trouble can easily put more downward trend to the stock. Tesla depends so much in worldwide car sales to recoup the downward car sale trend in US.\n\n3. Choosing Tesla would probably have desired effect as it hurts American brand but doesn't anger Trump enough to retaliate. Trump is never a fan of electric cars.\n\nTldr: buy spx puts, TSLA puts, gm puts", "created_utc": 1559314314, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bv8h48/tsla_risks_in_getting_caught_in_trade_war/", "is_self": true}
