But how high will Ford go?\n\nWhy I think Ford will be mooning over the next few weeks.\n\n1. Even though its been a meme, it seems this market follows memes more than anything else. So it may be very true that with all of these Ford police vehicles being damaged in the riots, it would in fact cause more orders from the local PD's to Ford. \n\n2. Ford is becoming a 'trend' brand car in China. Its very rare to see an American branded car in China, due to imports, etc, but since Ford started a venture there, their sales jumped over 130% from last year. For some reason Chinese people adore americans. If you go there, they will literally want to take pictures of you just because you are white. \n\n3. Most importantly, with Robinhood users soaring since the lockdown came into place, there are a lot of millenials trying to dabble with stocks. Not only is Ford one of the most common stocks for new traders to buy, but just the other day Ford put out a statement condemning George Floyd's death and spoke out against racism. This will only draw the attention to Ford more for early investors and drive the price up.\n\nLet me know how retarded I am for thinking this and why.", "created_utc": 1591295237.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gwn3f1/why_i_believe_f_is_going_to_the_moon/", "is_self": true}
