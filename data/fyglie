But as with any tactical setback, a pivot can yield new opportunities for victory. \n\nThis market is indeed over-bought. Vix remains elevated. Yet we now have the odd aspect of the US government picking winners and losers from the market. \n\nThis invalidates SPY as a viable vehicle for playing the market. F and GE may have their shitty bonds purchased and may even have their individual shares snapped up - keeping SPY artificially inflated. \n\nBut the Fed can\u2019t and won\u2019t buy everything. Millions are still unemployed. Buying equities with tax dollars won\u2019t prevent a 30-40% drop in 2nd quarter GDP. So, some stonks will not live in the blue hued light of Trumps tanning bed. I seek these stonks and will ride them down brokebank mountain. \n\nI submit to you LULU. \nNot in the SP500 and not likely to be in a federal SPY ETF purchase. Not likely to be bailed out. Perhaps more work from home folks will buy in the short term, but are high priced sweatpants still a part of America\u2019s future?\n\nAnd then there\u2019s PLCE.\nIt\u2019s shitty children\u2019s retail. The virus will accelerate Amazon\u2019s devouring of the locations and all the little kiddies inside. Not in SPX, not a target for The government\u2019s newfound voracious stonk gobbling. \n\nHow screwed is CSGP?\nCoStar? Not in SPX, big in commercial real estate. Outdated business model. This may sink unless commercial office is somewhat supported by federal funds. \n\nI wipe my ass with WPC\nSimilar to above. Commercial real estate trusts are going to bleed in the coming months. \n\nTell me where I\u2019m wrong", "created_utc": 1586528213.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fyglie/building_a_fedproof_short_strategy/", "is_self": true}
