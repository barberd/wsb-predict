{"id": "g07717", "title": "Cheap Oil Companies", "selftext": "So at some point the bankruptcies will start escalating. It happened in 2015 and it\u2019ll happen again. But within the mess and chaos there are actual bargains to be had. Not many, mind you, but they\u2019re in there. Here is my general analysis, based on the actual balance sheets (which is all that matters to E&amp;amp;amp;amp;P companies in this kind of environment).\n\n**Near term debt aka impending death**\n\nSo near term debt is perfectly fine for a company to have on their balance sheet. But when your revenues are about to take a near term clobbering it\u2019s a little more dangerous. When that clobbering is going to be a tad bit more than \u201cnear term\u201d it becomes a suicide pact between your bondholders, banks, and management. So the key here is to find the companies with the least amount of debt due, the best cash flow, and the most room left in their revolvers to actually retire any upcoming maturities. Cash flows are based on $20 WTI *thru 2021* (so this is essentially a total blowdown scenario; if you can survive these conditions you can survive anything). Here\u2019s how that looks:\n\n**CXO**\n\nDebt due by YE21: $0\n\nEstimated FCF assuming $20 WTI: $1.33b\n\nRevolver drawn as of YE19: $0\n\nRevolver remaining YE19: $2b\n\nCash and equivalents YE19: $70m\n\n**PE**\n\nDebt due by YE21: $0\n\nEstimated FCF assuming $20 WTI: $799m\n\nRevolver drawn as of YE19: $0\n\nRevolver remaining YE19: $1b\n\nCash and equivalents YE19: $21m\n\n**FANG**\n\nDebt due by YE21: $400m\n\nEstimated FCF assuming $20 WTI: $1.7b\n\nRevolver drawn as of YE19: $13m\n\nRevolver remaining as of YE19: $3.35b\n\nCash and equivalents YE19: $128m\n\n**MRO**\n\nDebt due by YE21: $0\n\nEstimated FCF assuming $20 WTI: $85m\n\nRevolver drawn as of YE19: $0\n\nRevolver remaining as of YE19: $3b\n\nCash and equivalents as of YE19: $858m\n\n**DVN**\n\nDebt due by YE21: $0\n\nEstimated FCF assuming $20 WTI: $877m\n\nRevolver drawn as of YE19: $0\n\nRevolver remaining as of YE19: $3b\n\nCash and equivalents as of YE19: $1.8b \n\n\nThere are several other smaller companies that look attractive, but because they\u2019re so cheap and beaten they look like penny stocks at this point, and I don\u2019t want to get askew of whatever rules exist here. But there are a handful with clean balance sheets, fat lines of credit, and very low net debt/EBITDA that look very attractive. \n\nThese are all longer term plays. We\u2019re talking about options going out until at least the middle of next year, or longer. If you want cheap and (maybe) faster then you have to take more risk on the $.37/share stocks. Not sure who has that kind of appetite at this point, but they\u2019re out there. \n\n**TL:DR** Long dated calls on non-integrated E and P companies with strong balance sheets that can survive a deep recession in WTI prices.", "created_utc": 1586734045.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g07717/cheap_oil_companies/", "is_self": true}
