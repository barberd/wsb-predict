Did a bit of my own digging on them and there seems to be something to the idea that the stock is going to have a near term pop due to this proxy battle. Zacks even had a little run down back on 4/3 about IV spiking on the 7/17 $8 *puts*. [(Zacks)](https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/852683/implied-volatility-surging-for-gamestop-gme-stock-options)\n\nAs one commenter on the WSB post suggested, the $10c 7/17 seemed most attractive. Dove in for 50 of them near the end of close 4/13 at a cost basis of $0.186/contract. \n\nRegardless of GameStop\u2019s long term future, the short term indicates a chance at printing a big stack of cash if you can snag some contracts before IV takes hold again when this monster pops and the short squeeze really gets rolling.", "created_utc": 1586859005.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g12whe/gme_options_to_print/", "is_self": true}
