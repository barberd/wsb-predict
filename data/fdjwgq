{"id": "fdjwgq", "title": "Unusual Options - SBUX/FEYE/NFLX", "selftext": "Today I included the aggressive orders, SBUX seems really unusual.\n\nThese options orders  are on or above the ask. Many have the same expiry and strike. Also lots  of the orders were sweeps so these ppl were  breaking down their order to get filled faster.\n\nAlso all  these orders volume of the contracts exceeded the open  interest    in   multiple trades so it's most likely not closing  positions.  Either    buy     to  open orders or sell to open orders and  based on  the    aggressiveness  of the orders one can infer its buy to  open. Some  of     these may be    hedges  and some most likely not.\n\nData is here - [https://ibb.co/z8VP2VJ](https://ibb.co/z8VP2VJ)\n\nThis is just some of today's orders, i know it is late in the day but I am doing the best I can do right now to post these.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe SBUX orders are very aggressive, normally sbux does not have so many sweeping orders especially all puts going way OTM (60 put). Unsure if their is a dividend date or any news pending but that should be watched. Part of the FEYE call move is already over so unsure if that is worth chasing. NFLX calls are expecting a breakout above resistance but they have gotten the timing wrong before so I don't think anyone should chase those, if you do go out further and look into spreads.\n\nThe safest put seems SBUX since its many months away. If anyone has any idea why so many puts in sweeps happened today let me know\n\nDon't just enter YOLO's in positions based on this data alone in most cases. Use  technicals/fundamentals/options data/market feelings all combined  instead of just 1 of these.   Use protection like  spreads if you worry  about losing what u   put in     and    be  smart,  understand the risks of putting $ into weekly  expiry's, consider a longer expiry.\n\nAlso with the market going lower use technicals/fundamentals/options data-flow/market  sediment all combined.\n\nI wanted to add, 50 Cent VIX trader ruffer llp (or whatever) is still holding their vix calls as of 3-4-20.\n\nAlso, someone said ibb has ads so use an adblocker we are in 2020", "created_utc": 1583356532.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fdjwgq/unusual_options_sbuxfeyenflx/", "is_self": true}
