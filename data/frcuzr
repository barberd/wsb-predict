{"id": "frcuzr", "title": "Order 66: The Revenge of the Bears", "selftext": "**I. Is the Rally Over?**\n\nThe bear market rally is gaining exhaustion. During the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, markets fell from 116.79 on SPY to 80.63, representing a decline of \\~31%. This year, we reached ATH on SPY at 338.34 and bounced, closing at 222.95, representing a retrace of \\~34%. Curiously enough, if you look at the first major decline in 1929, the first drop was also \\~34%.\n\nThere's a few things to note: the time it took from ATH to our temporary bottom was 23 days. During the reflexive or relief rally, we closed at 261.2 on Thursday, which is a rebound of 17% based on the close.\n\nThe time it took to rally was 3 days. What do these numbers mean? In just 13% of the time it took for our decline, we rebounded almost 20%. What about Friday? We had a significant decline, most likely as firms and funds did not want to hold positions over the weekend resulting in selling.\n\n[SPY 1 Yr\\/1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/inzw8a5mwnp41.png?width=1968&format=png&auto=webp&s=f04cc9dbeda986d4be850fb84930e1197b66696b)\n\nWhat about the volume? Selling volume rapidly increased, peaking near a volume of 400 million shares which corresponded to a temporary bounce. Selling volume decreased before peaking once more at 400 million shares until it eventually subsided at 218.26. What happened to the buying volume during the rally? We peaked on Wednesday. Buying volume has declined rapidly from Thursday and Friday as shown in the blue circle.\n\n**II. The Case for Climbing Higher**\n\nAfter passing the senate vote for the stimulus bill, the market rallied through the afternoon on Thursday before hitting a wall at 259. It stayed almost completely flat, where at this point, a large battle was playing out to contest the direction of the market. Was the stimulus bill enough to push the rally higher and break past 265 to eventually open 269 and even 300? We had an eye popping push to 263 in nearly the last minute of trading.\n\n[SPY 10 D\\/30 min](https://preview.redd.it/ylt9ob273op41.png?width=1968&format=png&auto=webp&s=23fc07869de1b949c43582dc11c987d9e4be0c96)\n\nFriday, the stimulus bill passed and we began retracing to the highs of yesterday. Ultimately, we never got there and most buyers sold off into the weekend. But WSB cries out, \"it's a bullish engulfing candle\"! Let's take a look at some other evidence.\n\n**III. Dark Pools and Gamma Exposure**\n\nWhile the actions of market participants may be obscured, the actions of MM will follow a certain predictable pattern. In the case of an institution purchasing a collar, short OTM puts are offset with the sale of a long OTM call. On the other hand of this transaction is a MM who sells the short OTM put and purchases the long OTM call.\n\n[GEX in orange, SPX in blue](https://preview.redd.it/xy1r4d474op41.png?width=548&format=png&auto=webp&s=119dc2b06002ab6862e73893d23969808b80cd83)\n\nWhen people are scrambling to purchase options to hedge, this is reflected in two areas. One is in volatility, which is more of a reflection for the *expected* demand of options 1 month out (this is a great simplification). The other is in gamma exposure, or GEX as given by Squeezemetrics. In this case, net gamma exposure will dramatically decrease as the selling of put options results in negative gamma for MM. These positions need to be delta hedged due to an imbalance of the gamma. This is a little counterintuitive, but during negative gamma exposure, MM actually contribute towards selling (delta hedging) since gamma becomes lower once an OTM put becomes ITM and simultaneously increasing expected volatility.\n\nWhat happens when the gamma flips, and MM are instead long gamma? In other words, what happens when there is less demand for hedging and instead firms are purchasing short OTM calls and selling long OTM puts? MM on the other side of the trade now purchase more long calls and have increased, positive gamma. To counteract this positive gamma, MM actively start buying shares (delta hedging) to reduce this gamma exposure, especially if the stock price starts declining, limiting more downside.\n\n[DIX in orange, SPX in blue](https://preview.redd.it/zt0zgzv54op41.png?width=549&format=png&auto=webp&s=513ebd20beac85d1ec3c1dd51d80001d0fd6a167)\n\nThis can be reflected in the amount of trading within dark pools. For example, prior to the gamma flip, net gamma exposure was highly positive. During the first wave of selling, net gamma exposure was positive. After the gamma flip, dark pool activity significantly increased as MM subsequently needed to delta hedge their positions by increasing selling into the market as well. As selling leveled off at the bottom, gamma again flipped to positive, corresponding to huge increases in dark pool activity increased. From Squeezemetrics,\n\n>Very high relative percentages (\u226545%) of dollar-weighted short volume (DIX) are associated with mean 60-market-day returns of 5.3%.\n\nGEX has flipped to negative once more, and DIX appears to be losing momentum. The next few days will be interesting to see what the trends really are.\n\n**IV. Summary**\n\nWhat about commodities such as gold and oil? What about volatility? What about options flows? I've talked at length in my previous posts at what to look at and what I have observed. I leave it to you guys to take a look and figure them out.\n\n**tl;dr Possibility of climbing higher to retest 265 as money flows back in, along with final EOM rebalancing. Drop imminent.**\n\n**tl;dr of tl;dr bears have smaller DIX.**\n\n3/29/20 5pm EST - Bids lining up at 2460 on /ES already.\n\nSlowing the spread for another month. Much surprise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor numbers, like I said the backtest at 265 will be critical. If it holds and breaks that level, upside. Need to see below 247 and ideally 233 to truly start the next leg down.", "created_utc": 1585514361.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frcuzr/order_66_the_revenge_of_the_bears/", "is_self": true}
