{"id": "ds0gs3", "title": "Help an autistic out", "selftext": "Hello fellow Autists,\n\nI'm new trading options and theres two things I would really appreciate some clarification on.\n\n1. I have two $31.50 puts 11/8 on UBER because I think it's going down due to share lockdown expiration like pinterest. Now let's say that its goes below my breakeven price (it's like 28.6), what do I have to do in order to receive my winnings? I know my contract will go up in value and I can sell it, but what do I actually need to do in order to sell the 100 stocks at $31.5? Do I need to have enough money in robinhood to buy the shares at the current price (below 28.6?) Or is it as simple as me pressing a button/ or robinhood doing it all for me when the shares expire? \n\n2. Is it really possible to buy puts/calls that already are breaking even? I've seen these options there but like it blows my mind that I can buy it and then immediately sell them at a profit? What would prevent me from doing this? \n\nThanks, appreciate any help that comes my way \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb", "created_utc": 1572966685, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ds0gs3/help_an_autistic_out/", "is_self": true}
