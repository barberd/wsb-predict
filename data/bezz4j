Yesterday had been a particularly crappy day, so I thought, eh, fuck it. I grabbed a slice of the room temperature 'za and... hey, not bad. I mean, I wasn't particularly surprised, because who hasn't had cold pizza at some and been like *Hey, this is alright*. It made me think about Pizza Hut as a brand, and it's holding company, YUM!\n\nSure, Pizza Hut pizza is arguably even barely pizza. Greasy, hot slab of dough and cheese? Not great. But guess what? Kids eat this shit like a starving herd of Ethiopians at the Sizzler. I bet we have [this crap](https://lenpenzo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/pizza-delivery.png) at my house weekly. Sure, I could cook them a healthy meal, but this is America, goddammit.\n\nBut it's not just Pizza Hut. Want some poor approximation of fried chicken? YUM runs KFC. Yeah, you can get the Colonels disappointing soggy blend of 11 herbs and spices if you just hate yourself, or one of those godawful Double-Down sandwiches where they replace the bread of a regular sandwich *with fried chicken I mean come on what in the fuck KFC?* But you know what shows up at least once at every potluck? A goddamned red and white striped bucket of room temperature chicken, because someone [couldn't be assed to care](http://i.imgur.com/1ZklJ9B.jpg) enough to make something.\n\nPulling a late night rager? YUM has you covered with Taco Bell- [The King of late night drunk munchies.](http://www.quickmeme.com/img/15/1561011ba7ed4516e0e3459c6e5cf24faba70a1b748672d48d3b85414a3d2065.jpg) Any combinations of meats shoved in some form of soft or fried tortillas, sometimes covered with Dorito dust, always guaranteed to get some on your shirt.\n\nKFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell. Three staples of the American Diet. \n\nBut if that's not enough convincing, [let's look at the big ol' dumb chart, enhanced by shitty MS Paint.](https://i.imgur.com/y0kqcu4.jpg)\n\nAnd if that STILL isn't convincing enough, [America's Top Stock Autist Jim Cramer loves YUM.](https://i.imgur.com/Qanu2pv.jpg)\n\n**My retarded thesis:** Fat folks (myself included) gonna keep eatin'. Long YUM.\n\n**My retarded play:** One Month Deep ITM Bull Credit Spread just to see what will happen.
