{"id": "fr78dp", "title": "Goldilocks and the 5 bulls: a \"just right\" explanation of Implied Volatility", "selftext": "No, this isn't about that Piper Perri scene you watched last night.\n\nI've seen a lot of explanations of implied volatility (IV) recently, but they were all either too long, too short, or not enough detail. This is going to be just right for your smooth brains to understand. \n\n**TL;DR** Why is it called implied volatility? Because it is the expected future volatility *implied by* the current option price. This TL;DR is fake. Read the example:\n\nImagine a world where SPCE stock currently trades at $100 (stop drooling) and 1 year from now, there are only two outcomes in the world: SPCE changes by 10% up or down (**the expected volatility**). Goes to $90 or $110. It's a coin flip. Given interest rates are zero and SPCE doesn't pay a dividend, $100 is a fair price given these expected values `(50% * $90 + 50% * $110 = $100)`. What should the price of a $100 SPCE call option expiring 1 year from now be?\n\n* SPCE goes to $90 in a year: call option is worth $0 at expiration\n* SPCE goes to $110 in a year: call option is worth $10 at expiration\n\nIt's a coin flip, right? So the expected (average) value is: `$0 * 50% + $10 * 50% = $5`. If you don't know why the call options are worth $0 and $10 at expiration, fuck off.\n\nWhat if you or the market expected the future prices of SPCE to be higher and lower than the previous example (**more volatile**)? What if expected volatility was 20% and the future states were $80 or $120? Same price today of $100.\n\n* SPCE goes to $80 in a year: call option is still worth $0 at expiration\n* SPCE goes to $120 in a year: call option is now worth $20 at expiration\n\nSame coin flip: `$0 * 50% + $20 * 50% = $10`. And just like that (I'm sure the Bulls said that to Piper a few times), the increase in expected level of future volatility made the option worth more, even though the underlying stock price did not change.\n\n*But InvesticenterBlowie, you said this was about implied volatility and you blabbered on about expected volatility and this is too long already.*\n\nOK zoomer, let's wrap it up (like I wish your dad did): we know everything about the option when we view it in the broker platform: strike, expiration, put or call, underlying price, and option price (**the only thing changing here**). We can look up the dividend and the risk free rate. If we have an option valuation model at our disposal (which we do, Black Scholes Merton or otherwise), we can work backwards from all the given information and compute the expected volatility. That's why it's called *implied* volatility. IV is embedded and linked to the price of the option; it is the future expected volatility *implied by* the current option price.\n\nPositions: [https://imgur.com/a/IfEAlDA](https://imgur.com/a/IfEAlDA) a mess of puts entered over time (averaged into IWM) when IV was high, expecting it to go higher.
