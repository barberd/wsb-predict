{"id": "gj1zm1", "title": "Catalyst swing trading", "selftext": "I\u2019ve gotten a fair amount of questions regarding swing trading biotechs recently and figured I\u2019d make an actual post for all you autists. Instead of trying to time SPY and TSLA options randomly every day you can use this website to find FDA and PDUFA approval dates to swing trade either stocks or options. If approval is met guaranteed gap up 20-50 percent overnight. If approval is denied or delayed guaranteed 20-50% gap down\n\nFriday is the next one listed and it\u2019s CLVS or Clovis Oncology. They have a drug, Rubraca, that is approved for ovarian cancer, on Friday they have a PDUFA date to see if it gets approved for prostate cancer too. Personally I\u2019m holding 500 shares and am not playing options on it, but you can judge your own risk tolerance.\n\nSometimes you can even see yourself go up 10% or more before the date even comes due to FOMO. I\u2019ve seen success in the last month with AKBA, NVAX, AVEO, and MYOK, all 40%ish gap ups overnight. The only one I lost on was GPMC which dropped 12% before my stop loss kicked in on a product delay. This is just an idea for risk tolerant investors, there\u2019s dates nearly every week of the year that you can do your own DD on. Good luck.\n\n[https://www.biopharmcatalyst.com/](https://www.biopharmcatalyst.com/) ", "created_utc": 1589386209.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gj1zm1/catalyst_swing_trading/", "is_self": true}
