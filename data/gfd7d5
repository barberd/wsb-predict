{"id": "gfd7d5", "title": "$SONO 1/22 $12.50 - Hear me out.", "selftext": "For such a big \"miss\" Sonos hasn't really fallen much, especially compared to yesterday's gains. 1/22 $12.50 leaps were surprisingly cheap yesterday, and only a bit cheaper today (for such a long time horizon).\n\nI don't know if the options are well priced / ideally priced, but I'm not going to play that game. What I'm interested in is how likely will this stock be > $12.50 by Jan. 2022.\n\n**100% chance it will be greater than $12.50 before 1/22.**\n\nWhere it will be at 1/22, I don't really care. If there's some semblance of profit greater than my threshold, than I'm happy. FWIW, if I see > 80% return in less than a week, that's a great place to start taking profit. If I see > 400% return in < 12 months, I'm out, until it makes sense to be in again.\n\n**TL;DR:** SONO 1/22 @$12.50. (bought yesterday before earnings).\n\nI'm not going to eat anything or do anything if it's a good play - because that's ridiculous.\n\nI'm not going to eat anything or do anything if it's a bad play - because that's WSB-level ridiculous.\n\n[Minimal TA](https://preview.redd.it/1m33q9sw4ex41.png?width=2508&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba383d82e2bb57d10fb5fbbff5dd8cfdb37ec6a4)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Addendum:** Sonos could have eaten it so many years ago. The fact is, despite the growth in Apple and Google branded smart home speakers, Sonos is still the only comprehensive sound system / product out there. It's got a VERY loyal fan base (even despite the BS sunsetting of support) and it's got a big sticky factor. Once you get one, you're very likely to keep adding to your room / cave / closet / juice factory / mega mansion.\n\nI do believe they've been fairly treated by the market. Their Direct to Consumer approach has been pretty crappy - but that's compared to Google and Apple. This matters more than ever right now because DTC is the only real way to sell consumer goods right now. If Sonos got hit hard due to inventory issues with its big box suppliers, then so did everyone else. Compared to the big (but lower quality) players out there like Bose, Vizio, Samsung, Sonos dominates them in DTC.\n\nWe know DTC works because Amazon, Peloton, Overstock and Wayfair have been killing it. AMZN is cheating because of cloud services...but people are stuck home and they're buying stuff.\n\nFinancially, Sonos is also in a good spot. From their most recent 10-Q, they've got 283MM in unrestricted cash/liquid investments. They've got 213MM in current liabilities, so they're not in huge danger of insolvency (especially with their current inventories). If you add in their LT Debt of $21MM, they're still in good shape re: Asset / Liabilities.\n\nAll this to say ... SONO long term is a good risk / reward payoff. Feel free to YOLO if you want - but I think that's ridiculous. It's more likely that you can get 5, 100% returns over 12 months in the same stock than you can a 500% return in 1 stock in < 1 month. But then again, I'm not WSBGod and/or I don't have the time to use MSPaint for my \"gains\".\n\nI hope you earn everything and I hope you have a safe, healthy and happy life.", "created_utc": 1588879273.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gfd7d5/sono_122_1250_hear_me_out/", "is_self": true}
