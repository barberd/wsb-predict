Instead of seeing Robbinghood as red, I started to see it as green (except on Monday when all it showed was Janet Yellens big ole tiddies ). Last night I spent an hour in the shower, furiously masturbating my 2 inch pp to a picture of Jerome Powell while on MDMA and praying to the tendies gods that we\u2019ll see a red $SPY on Monday. I heard a knock on the bathroom door. It\u2019s none other than Jeromey Romey Rome, standing naked in all his glory. I grab his salt and pepper hair violently and then we make love all night long. It\u2019s a good day to be a \ud83d\udc3b\ud83c\udf08. I hope the $SPY goes down harder than I went down on sexy FRCILF JPow\n\ntldr: $20 4/20 $ACB calls", "created_utc": 1583629271.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ff4tnw/the_difference_a_month_makes/", "is_self": true}
