{"id": "gt62lj", "title": "DD Numero Deux: A Case for Buying $THM", "selftext": "If you had followed my \\[shitty DD no. 1\\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gjsp93/buy\\_gsx\\_puts/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gjsp93/buy_gsx_puts/)), you would have made money even though $GSX stock price has somewhat recovered from its recent low.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo options for this one, so shares will have to do, however, small caps stocks can act like options in that they can literally go up over 100% in a few days like $THM did from \\~$0.625 to $1.18 (after hours) in 3 days with no expiry date.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy should it go up more than it already has?   Well, it's because the price of $GLD is approaching an all time high price of \\~$183 reached in August 29, 2011.  When you go back and look at $THM stock price on that date, you would see that it was trading for \\~$8.5.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow the volume and the price action has picked up significantly in the last 3 days and as you should know by now, the stock market is forward looking mechanism and people already bid up QQQ ETF index and it looked like a V shape recovery on the ETF price graph even though the economy's proverbial ass is still raw from the rough fucking it received from COVID 19.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am, like all the other DDs on this sub, speculating that the stock is going to reach a few multiple times from current price level in the next few weeks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is the corporate presentation that they posted on the investor relations' site:   [https://www.ithmines.com/\\_resources/presentations/corporate-presentation.pdf](https://www.ithmines.com/_resources/presentations/corporate-presentation.pdf).  Page 5 is where the meat of this presentation, they are claiming that the market cap of $THM should be at $715 million if you use Net Present Value discount rate of 5% and they also claimed at the bottom in small print (ITH Market Cap as of May 6, 2020. Based on financial model used in April 10, 2017 NI 43-101 Technical Report)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo on close of May 6, 2020, $THM closed at $0.54 and now after hours it's trading at $1.18:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n0.14 (they claimed it's only 14% of the ideal market cap vs. market cap on May 6) multiply $1.18/$0.54 = 0.3059 (that is 30% of the ideal market cap vs. current market cap)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo you can play with the numbers, increased the discount rate to see it's still extremely undervalued and not to mention the fact that the price of the stock (mining) is correlated with increase in the price of gold where in this environment, every risk asset is being bid up including gold.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for coming to my Ted talk.", "created_utc": 1590804292.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gt62lj/dd_numero_deux_a_case_for_buying_thm/", "is_self": true}
