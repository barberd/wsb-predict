From that point on bad economic news was good, because all these fucking degenerates on the street were lining up at the safe cheap capital injection sites to get their fix. Since then there hasn\u2019t been much in the macro that has been taken as bad news by the market because it put the fed in a box in terms of further rate cuts. \n \nEven trumpy boi used his twitter fingers to spew out actual bad news (tariff hikes after first rate cut after he didn\u2019t get his .50 bps cut) to further put the fed into that box. IT PUTS THE RATE CUTS ON THE SKIN. \n\nMy question is when do we have the shift to bad news being bad news again? Like at what point does the market actually get spooked by bad economic data? Right now it seems like the only downward catalysts could be the reintroduction or uncertainty from the trade talks breaking down or Brexit somehow blowing up like a street corner in 2007 iraq. \n\nThe only thing i can think of that\u2019d be a \u201cblack swan\u201d is a euro bank going under or something going seriously fucking wrong in China with their credit markets. \n\nDiscuss.", "created_utc": 1572489236, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dphai5/so_is_bad_news_back_to_being_bad_news_now_that/", "is_self": true}
