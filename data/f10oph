My family cuckolded me and is only giving me $11.2 million that is already legally mine, until I demonstrate maturity, get a job, blah blah fucking blah. Already have over $400k I can start investing in ~24 hours. Rest is coming next week hopefully. \n\nTime to blow this 11 milli (jk) (but not really) \n\nIdk if futures or options are more speculative and which can earn more multiples. Please advise.\n\nFor those that are considering labeling me a spoiled brat - yes I am. It\u2019s all relative. When you\u2019re thinking you\u2019re going to receive $150 million and receive not even 1/10th of that plenty of things you\u2019ve expected you were going to do for YEARS just took a big dump on your forehead.", "created_utc": 1581208739, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f10oph/about_to_receive_over_11_million_currently_have/", "is_self": true}
