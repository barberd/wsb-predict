A systematic downgrade will result in forced selling and margin calls as investors (institutions) are forced to dump to chase the quality upwards.\n\nThe Fed can go out to buy even junk grade bonds (eg the underlying collateral in the CLOs) but that is limited in number and does not cover the entire tranche.  These products can get pretty sophisticated and the Fed will probably bail them out too in another form of giant receivership.  But to do so they will have to extend and amend the program which may or may not require Congressional approval.  Please also note that the Fed CANNOT (currently) buy CCC rated bonds.\n\n\"recall that the expanded Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) announced by the Fed last Thursday only buys AAA-rated bonds of CLOs, which after the [coming tsunami of CLO downgrades ](https://www.zerohedge.com/economics/clos-face-extinction-level-event-moodys-prepares-downgrade-fifth-all-clo-bonds)is complete, will not only collapse in nominal size but will mean that any further attempts to stabilize the CLO space will require yet another Fed backstop of even riskier - i.e., rated AA and lower - structured products.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:  Some additional color from my own notes.  Also b/c you autists keep asking for positions - UDOW May 40p.\n\nMost of the central bank\u2019s junk-bond intervention will likely be limited to \u201cfallen angels,\u201d or companies that were rated investment grade on March 22 when the program was introduced.   For example, the Fed can bailout F, which got downgraded to junk on March 25. But companies that were downgraded to junk BEFORE the March 22 cutoff will not qualify.\n\nThe Fed has a 2 pronged buying approach for  junk bonds:  A) buy up to $250 billion of debt in secondary trading.  B) buy up to $500 billion directly from companies.\n\n[https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/something-impossible-just-happened-clo-just-failed-its-aaa-overcollateralization-test](https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/something-impossible-just-happened-clo-just-failed-its-aaa-overcollateralization-test)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/93ckmlfr51u41.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6f6839b705f3e8f2b03c6e36467532e0338603f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pobmdmft51u41.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce1c357b4abdaad4623414a8032242759963f760", "created_utc": 1587413977.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g50dii/clo_downgrades_will_make_oil_crash_seem_minor_in/", "is_self": true}
