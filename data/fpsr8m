{"id": "fpsr8m", "title": "Teva Pharmaceuticals calls", "selftext": "First DD post.\n\nI'll post a bullish (my position) and bearish case to be fair.\n\nTeva has recently donated 6-10 million tablets of hydroxychloroquine sulfate depending on which source you go with. It has recently been widely considered an effective treatment of CV. Most recently the state of NY has been making plans to conduct trials with the combination of  hydroxychloroquine and Zithromax and chloroquine. Teva is a manufacturer of the drug as well as several others.\n\n [https://abcnews.go.com/Health/clinical-trials-begin-week-york-coronavirus-treatments-health/story?id=69817703](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/clinical-trials-begin-week-york-coronavirus-treatments-health/story?id=69817703) \n\nGeneral public: Cool... they said CV so I'm in 100%\n\nThis isn't a CV play although,  you could swing play that sentiment. The REAL reason that this is a long term call is this -\n\nProAir is on backorder for the foreseeable future. It has been used a first line defense for breathing treatments. This has increased exponentially during the CV-19 crisis. Teva makes this.\n\n [https://community.aafa.org/blog/albuterol-inhaler-shortage-due-to-covid-19-could-impact-people-with-asthma](https://community.aafa.org/blog/albuterol-inhaler-shortage-due-to-covid-19-could-impact-people-with-asthma) \n\nMS patients prescriptions are being reevaluated, and prescribed back to Copaxone. Why? Their current therapies have  immunosuppressant qualities. Docs don't want their patients on those types of drugs during this pandemic. Who makes Copaxone? Teva. Currently, Copaxone is the safest drug on the market given the situation.\n\n [https://www.mstrust.org.uk/news/update-coronavirus-covid-19-and-multiple-sclerosis](https://www.mstrust.org.uk/news/update-coronavirus-covid-19-and-multiple-sclerosis) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTeva also produces a generic EpiPen.. which was in shortage before COVID-19. So much so that the FDA has allowed for the expiration of EpiPens to go beyond the label. This will continue to be the case as people are hoarding. I could cite many sources talking about medication hoarding.. but the EpiPen is a biggun. \n\n [https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/drugshortages/dsp\\_ActiveIngredientDetails.cfm?AI=Epinephrine%20Injection,%200.1%20mg/mL&st=c&tab=tabs-1](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/drugshortages/dsp_ActiveIngredientDetails.cfm?AI=Epinephrine%20Injection,%200.1%20mg/mL&st=c&tab=tabs-1) \n\nFurther.. with a check of what Teva is bringing in, I can see that albuterol or ProAir has increased significantly. I'm also seeing a dramatic increase in anti-inflammatory drugs... Which backs up my theory that CV is taking a stranglehold on us... but has also created a demand from Teva.\n\nWhy is Teva different from other manufacturers? They create their own APIs... while China and India have shut down exports or their drugs.. Teva is in the best position they have ever been in. \n\n [https://www.tevapharm.com/product-focus/teva-api/](https://www.tevapharm.com/product-focus/teva-api/) \n\nMost recently Teva has donated 10-16 mil of  hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets. (depending on your source) Why does that matter and why does it help/hurt Teva? The impending opiod settlement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBear theory - \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSelf admittedly, I'm long. The pending opiod settlement is the dark cloud over Teva's head. That being said.. The court that will hear that case is in NY.. where Teva has just donated millions of tablets. They're proactively providing tablets as a PR imo. I legitimately see this lawsuit gradually becoming less of a thing and less of a settlement. However.. If I'm wrong.. Teva still provided life saving drugs during a pandemic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL/DR buy teva calls\n\nMy positions 4/17 c 11$, 6/19 c 15$, 9/18 c 17$, 1/15/21 15$ c.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor whatever reason I couldn't post this to DD.. and had to post it to discusssion.\n\nDumb.", "created_utc": 1585294184.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpsr8m/teva_pharmaceuticals_calls/", "is_self": true}
