{"id": "gnx2ht", "title": "Am I missing something? MSFT DD included for free", "selftext": "So I have been reviewing Deep ITM options, for a few months, just tracking the price impacts with the price of the stock. Since these options are able to be exercised at a better than market rate, the price tends to stay at a range just outside of profitability.   \n\n\nFor example, Oct 16 2020 $240 MSFT Puts at the time of writing on RH are 55.38, while MSFT is 185.38.   \n\n\nSo you can buy this Put and instantly exercise for no profit and lose money to fees.   \n\n\n  \nTo continue the example, Oct 16 2020 $100 MSFT calls are $85.98, while the MSFT is still $185.38.   \n\n\nSo you could buy this and instantly exercise to the cool loss of $0.60.  \n\n\nAssuming you buy both, with the intent to sell and rebuy daily/several times day benefiting from variance to reap rewards. Provided you are watching and time things well, there should be potential to buy and sell the same options over the course of the day as they dip. With the added benefit that only a truly massive change in value can zero out your positions, and the profits from the inverse position recoup the losses to an equal extent(this is also a time to maybe buy additional Put in anticipation of the market correction, when the market then corrects the previous position that dipped hard will rebound into some additional gains and those are reaped as a profit.   \n\n\nObvious downside is the individual options are expensive, the process requires paying attention to hit well timed moments to submit orders, and that you need a $25k to day trade.   \n\n\nI'm obviously a novice so I assume I am overlooking something like an incredibly low trade volume for this type of option, or some other related issue that would require having the funds to exercise the option or some other shit.   \n\n\nBut what do you guys think? Does buying long term Deep ITM Calls/Puts for same expiration, and day trading to reap profit on variance and the weak hands of others work? Or why doesn't it? Explain to me why I'm such an Autist???", "created_utc": 1590068556.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gnx2ht/am_i_missing_something_msft_dd_included_for_free/", "is_self": true}
