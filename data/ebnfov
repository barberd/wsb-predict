{"id": "ebnfov", "title": "I found out the secret of RobinHood", "selftext": "Do you know why RobinHood introduced options trading? So that they could fuck us over and make money in the process. Here's the story\n\nSo a month ago while trading, I tried a rather unpopular strategy: long $SPY. Put in all the money from my bank account and bought 10 shares. I made 80 fucking bucks in profit. In a month. More than inflation.\n\nAnd then there are all of you autists losing all of your money PLUS MORE on fucking options. This is what RobinHood is doing: instead of sinking your money into dumbass options, they're just saying you have options, and investing all that shit into $SPY long. They use your losses and some of their profits to offset autistic wins.\n\nBoom\n\nRobinHood busted\n\nThank you for coming to my Robin Talk", "created_utc": 1576540277, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ebnfov/i_found_out_the_secret_of_robinhood/", "is_self": true}
