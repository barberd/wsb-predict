Good case (odds: 20%) \u2013 the Fed cuts the FF and IOER rates by 25bp and concludes the balance sheet run-off process (which is 6 weeks earlier than previously scheduled). The statement stays largely the same as before. Powell doesn\u2019t use the word patient and signals at least one additional 25bp cut this year. His emphasis during the press conf. isn\u2019t just on \u201cinsurance\u201d but also disinflationary headwinds, a flat yield curve, and ongoing int\u2019l pressures. Powell doesn\u2019t shy away from balance sheet questions and says this very much remains a key component of the policy toolkit (and hints the balance sheet could be utilized even before the FF returns to zero). No one dissents.\n\n2. Best case (odds: 10%) \u2013 everything in the \u201cgood case\u201d except the Fed cuts rates 50bp.\n\n\n\n#Best Case For Trade Talks\n\nBest case (odds: 10%): a joint communique is published with the two sides agreeing on specific language concerning the contours of the economic relationship. China commits to make changes to certain laws aimed at placating US demands (this issue of changing local laws seems to be the key sticking point). Trump permanently removes the threat of incremental tariffs ($300B/25%) and suggests some (or all) of the existing ones could be rescinded. China ramps US agricultural purchases and the US Commerce Department hands out large Huawei waivers.", "created_utc": 1564527056, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cjzigs/the_good_and_best_case_for_fed_tmw_trade_talks/", "is_self": true}
