{"id": "c8odf3", "title": "BYND updated borrow rates", "selftext": "S3 has taken a little bit of a hiatus from posting updated short interest and borrow rates on BYND so I haven't been posting every day, but I have been calling around to brokers that I know of to get their short borrow rates. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs of now, the borrow rates I am seeing for BYND are about 106%, this was down from 116% yesterday and from 110% the day before. Fidelity, Schwab and a few others max out at 99% before charging higher rates to their institutional clients vs. their retail client base. That is data I don't have access to. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast update we have from S3 (data analytics firm) is from July 1st and is that BYND has 5.44m shares shorted, about 46.4% of the float. Borrow rate they were seeing was 113% and rising. But that is a couple day old data. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo where do we go from here? I am still holding my August calls, but I have a bit of cushion in the positions to wait and see. Obviously the past few days have been rough. Price and volume down- not good combinations. If I capitulate and sell, you'll know its the bottom :) Let me know if I am being an idiot. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHave a happy 4th of July everyone!", "created_utc": 1562162090, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c8odf3/bynd_updated_borrow_rates/", "is_self": true}
