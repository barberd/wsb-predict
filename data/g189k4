{"id": "g189k4", "title": "TSLA DD", "selftext": "**Why EVs will take over**\n\n* EVs are 70%+ cheaper to fuel\n* EVs should be 70%+ cheaper to maintain (due to significantly less moving parts) once EV service networks reach economies of scale.\n* Due to experience curves for key components, EVs upfront price should be less than an equivalent ICE car within 0-5 years, varying by market and segment. (Model 3 is already better value than all $44k+ ICE sedans).\n* EVs should last 2-3x longer than an ICE car in terms of miles (0.5-1 million).\n* EVs depreciation per year should be significantly less than ICE cars due to their longer lifespans, cheaper cost of ownership and fears of ICE car bans.\n* Consumers are not stupid, and when EVs are cheaper, they will buy them.\n* ICE cars kill 4m+ people per year from pollution.\n* ICE cars will lead to 2 billion + people losing their homes from global warming.\n* EVs are significantly safer to drive due to front crumple zone, lower center of gravity (limiting rollovers) and lower combustion risk.\n* Over time, this should drive significantly cheaper insurance vs ICE cars.\n* All self driving cars will be electric because after stripping out driver costs, an EV taxi service will make 2-4x more profit than an ICE taxi service due to lower fuel, maintenance & depreciation.\n* Regulations are supportive of the EV transition, particularly in China, and as the EV transition gains momentum it becomes a much easier political decision to ban ICE cars.\n* EVs are faster to accelerate and brake and are quieter and more fun to drive.\n* Leaving a car to charge overnight at home or during the day at work is significantly more convenient than regular trips to the gas station.\n* Fuel independence from Russia, Africa and the Middle East is a major advantage for national defence for countries such as China and much of Europe.\n* The EV transition will massively accelerate the experience curve for batteries which will make building solar/wind + battery storage cheaper than continuing to operate existing fossil fuel power plants. This will rapidly transition global electricity to renewables and ensure cars are charged by clean sources.\n\n**Why Tesla is best positioned to lead in the $3trn EV market and $2-3trn stationary storage market.**\n\n* Tesla started the EV revolution, they are still leading the revolution 10 years later, they are the company most incentivised to make it happen, they have a business model tailor made for it and all they need is 5% market share generate $40-$50bn+ EBITDA from car sales alone.\n* Tesla is leading in technology for all key EV components; it has developed the leading battery pack, motor, inverter, cooling system and auto electronics and co-developed the leading battery cells.\n* Tesla has the leading market share for EVs in terms of volume and generates the vast majority of all gross profit in the global EV industry.\n* Tesla has the quickest design to mass production cycle time in the industry by a significant margin. This means that not only does it have the leading R&D in the lab, but it gets this R&D into its products significantly quicker.\n* Tesla has a massive level of vertical integration which will allow it to make higher margins, while selling at lower prices and allowing significant agility to continuously upgrade its technology.\n* Tesla has a culture of rapid iteration and rapid progress perfectly suited to take advantage of the experience curves for EV components.\n* Elon has the best track record for disruption and rapid innovation of anyone in the world.\n* What Musk has already achieved at both Spacex and Tesla is significantly more difficult that what he's got left to do to reach his goals. The breakthroughs to get from 0 to 1% are a lot less visible to the general population than getting from 1% to 100%, but once you are at 1% it gets easier as you have proved technological viability and have momentum on experience curves.\n* Tesla owns its sales channel and is 100% incentivised to sell EVs.\n* Tesla has the most capital to invest in the EV transition (yes, this is true). Tesla does not have to waste its cash flow on ICE R&D, capex and redundancies or dividends or share buybacks. Tesla\u2019s cash flow available for expansion capex is currently running at c.$4bn per year and will grow rapidly with new products. Its shareholders would also be willing to invest more equity to accelerate growth.\n* Tesla and Elon\u2019s reputation mean it has the greatest choice of engineering talent. Over 500k people applied for jobs at Tesla in 2017.\n* Tesla has a vision that its employees, customers and investors believe in and are willing to work towards.\n* Tesla has the most data and the best track record for battery degradation. Many new EV programs are likely to face significant brand damage when they meet degradation or quality issues.\n* Tesla has the leading vehicle safety in the market, both for accident avoidance technology and for lower probability of injury once in an accident.\n* Tesla is debatably the leader in autonomous driving and has by far the largest real world data set to train its AI algorithms. Achieving self-driving could lead to almost unlimited demand for Tesla cars, appreciating second hand car prices and $50-150k profit per car per year to Tesla for every AP2/3 car it has ever sold.", "created_utc": 1586880268.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g189k4/tsla_dd/", "is_self": true}
