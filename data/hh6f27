{"id": "hh6f27", "title": "Micron Earnings on Monday", "selftext": "Alright I get it. A lot of you degenerates have been burned by this POS from it\u2019s volatile swings but listen up. Micron is turning around a dead old horse to position itself to be a profitable competitor in the future.\n\nDRAM prices are down, NAND prices are down, all memory prices are down due to the lack of consumer demand from the bat flu and Memory chips are the business of Micron. However Micron has pivoted their business to focus their revenue on the X100 3D Xpoint chip. A memory chip that bridges the gap between NAND and DRAM. It\u2019s cheaper than DRAM and faster than NAND. Currently they are only selling it to data centers. Think cloud here. Cloud big. Cloud is the future. Data center demand has kept up the revenue for Nvidia and other chip companies which have said they are relying on for revenue in the time being since sales in other sectors are down.\n\nBased on Micron\u2019s last quarter sales it seems they have pivoted to rely more on the X100 as a point of revenue for their future.\n\nhttps://blocksandfiles.com/2020/03/27/micron-q2-results-fall-less-than-feared-as-xpoint-sales-revealed/\n\nThe X100 was released in 2020 and if Micron was able to capture 7% of revenue from sales of the X100 in the first quarter then it is expected that the sales of xpoint will grow have grown this past quarter and will continue to grow as the technology is adopted in data centers.\n\nData center business demand has been the saving grace of revenue for Nvidia, AMD, and other chip stocks when they reported recently.\n\nMicron pivoted their business before the corona wave to target data center demand. Data demand went up when everyone was at home and will continue to go up in the future as data grows exponentially.\n\nMU: 55 C 7/17", "created_utc": 1593310242.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hh6f27/micron_earnings_on_monday/", "is_self": true}
