I think I may have been shadow banned at some point near the peak. I don\u2019t know, but I really care about this community and the last hour has drove that point home. \n\nMods have been doing an impossible and thankless task so far in 2020 (except the Pokimane thing, that was not funny on any level).  You guys are working your asses of for zero gain and a bunch of pain. So first, thank you. This isn\u2019t a critique, this is just coming from a place of ignorance and trying to help. \n\nI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m supposed to do to stay in the sub, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m supposed to do to be allowed to post. Do I contact a mod? Do I get on the discord server and bitch? There\u2019s no real documented path back from exile right now and it is confusing and upsetting, is it possible to post something to help those autists who are lost and can\u2019t find their way home to their tendies?\n\n1MM subs is a lot. An insane amount. I get going private, I get cutting the insane stream of absolute drivel that doesn\u2019t even remotely qualify as a shitpost. Is there a way to reduce this beyond going private? Or is this a natural progression of the sub? Do we stop trying to fight it and instead know that when this shitstorm passes the normies will lose interest?\n\nI don\u2019t know, but I do know I care about this sub, I care about the stupid memes and the DD alike. You all brought me from a normie with an account full of SPY bagholding to a fully fledged autist with an options account full of OTM FDs. Don\u2019t ever change. \n\nAlso, SPY 4/09 235. The Orange One has the Wu Tang Flu and the paper operation, the rate cut, they\u2019re all worthless.
