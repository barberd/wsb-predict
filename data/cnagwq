So you're locking up your money for 10 years, but getting less of a return. That means there's fears about the future.\n\n---\n\nSo, we know that \"inversions\" precede a recession, and we know we have [already inverted](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10Y3M) but when will the recession begin? \n\nHere's info in the timing of the last two recessions. \n\n**TL;DR: We inverted in May 2019. If the last two recessions are any indication, the recession will begin sometime between May 2020 and early 2021.
