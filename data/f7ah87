{"id": "f7ah87", "title": "$BABA DD", "selftext": "Thinking BABA looks like a good bull play.\n\n**Logical Analysis**\n\nLockdowns in China have been hitting every Chinese company's equity prices, because duh. But the lockdowns might actually be a good thing for BABA. More time stuck in your shitty apartment means more time trying to escape reality on the internet, which means more purchases on Alibaba/TaoBao and more ad revenue from their sites. They also beat earnings and revenue estimates in their report last week.\n\n**Technicals**\n\nCoronavirus has muted a \\~3 mo bull trend beginning in October, and price movements have been volatile and indecisive over the past month or so. This leaves it sitting far below almost every moving average you can throw at it. Other than that, I don't see any bearish signals and MACD has been looking good. Call premiums are cheap right now so deep exp should be a good play. I also have access to this Credit Suisse software through school that does valuations for you. It's probably for institutional investors only, but my class got it because we manage a small fund for the school. It's showing (with very conservative CFROI and Asset Growth rates) a [potential upside of over 200%](https://imgur.com/a/3Hyy5px). Nothing's written in stone but again, hey, calls are cheap. Good luck out there you degenerates.", "created_utc": 1582288501, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7ah87/baba_dd/", "is_self": true}
