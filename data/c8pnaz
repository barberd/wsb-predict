{"id": "c8pnaz", "title": "Let's talk gun stocks", "selftext": "Guns are a big industry in the US, and are closely tied to politics and policy. The best thing for the gun industry was Obama. All of the gun groups ran fear mongering that he would ban certain guns, destroy/reduce ammo, take our guns, etc. Ammo was selling so fast you couldn't get your hands on it, gun sales were through the roof with the 'get em while you can' mentality, gun manufacturers couldn't make the stuff fast enough.\n\nPrior to the 2016 election, manufacturers increased production and stockpiled, expecting Hillary and another huge boom in sales. When Trump got elected, demand plummeted and supply was through the roof. Remington declared bankruptcy and Smith and Wesson renamed to AOBC. VSTO (ammo) and AOBC (guns and accessories) fell to nickels on the dollar off their previous price, and the cost of gun stuff plummeted (now is the best time there has been to buy US made guns/ammo).\n\nThe Democrats have tied gun regulation very closely to their campaign this time. The campaigns are just now starting, the these two stocks AOBC and VSTO are just starting to crawl out of the mud. My bet is to long these and sell right before the election. The uncertainty laying up to it should increase sales. The real gamble being to hold these and reap more profits if a Democrat gets elected.", "created_utc": 1562168715, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c8pnaz/lets_talk_gun_stocks/", "is_self": true}
