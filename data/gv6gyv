{"id": "gv6gyv", "title": "Short zoom?", "selftext": "As far as I know (from my Organisation) Zoom (ZM) subscriptions are for a year and cost several thousand $ (this is for companies of a certain size, I believe for like 500 users). However, when we all go back to physical offices, especially when the subscriptions run out by next year (around end of feb. beginning Mar.), the stock should drop. No need for zoom on such a large scale. Even some companies who are letting their workers work from home won\u2019t have to purchase the whole package because a majority will go to offices, so purchases will be considerably smaller. Ergo, short ZM by next February?\n\nEdit: changed zoom to ZM, because that\u2019s the correct symbol.", "created_utc": 1591101115.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gv6gyv/short_zoom/", "is_self": true}
