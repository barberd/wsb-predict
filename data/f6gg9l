{"id": "f6gg9l", "title": "My bet on electric infrastructure.", "selftext": "I have a theory. VW just announced it's ended all participation in gasoline powered racing. In case you're unaware, VW is huge, and has a massive influence over the automotive scene.\n\nI have a feeling, as well as many others, that internal combustion engine (ICE) motorsports are going to take a pretty big hit from this. And if you're familiar with the car world, you know that racing has a huge impact on consumer cars in the form of new technologies. Much of the RND applied there makes it to us.\n\nWithout the world's largest automaker participating in ICE racing for the sake of greener appearances, I think other automakers will follow suit.\n\nWhat this would potentially mean is the racing world transitioning into electric. A robust electric racing scene would translate into much faster, and more aggressive RND into electric. Better efficiency is key here to go more laps with less charge, aerodynamics improve efficiency, new ways of restoring energy in ways similar to regenerative braking, etc. These will eventually find their way into their consumer vehicles making electric better, and this more popular, faster.\n\nThe other big thing is, if people can see electric racecars outperforming their ICE counterparts, people who may not otherwise like the idea of electric will start to see the hype and arguments for electric.\n\nAll this to say, the VW announcement, in conjunction with things like Mercedes stopping further development of ICE vehicles, I think that electric is going to be showing up much faster than people originally thought.\n\nthe most important thing for electric to work is good infrastructure. That's the one weakness right now. So I say, start backing electric vehicle infrastructure.\n\nI just bought up a large amount of BLNK (Blink Technologies) which is currently the only publicly traded electric vehicle charging infrastructure company. It's also the largest, boasting more charging stations and technologies than any other charging company.\n\nSo far, since the VW announcement, I'm up about 30%\n\nFood for thought!", "created_utc": 1582142609, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6gg9l/my_bet_on_electric_infrastructure/", "is_self": true}
