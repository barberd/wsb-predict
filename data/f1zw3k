I follow it religiously.\n\nSo for all you autists here, wanted to share with you why I think this $18 stock will end the year over $35.  \n\nBiotech, recently expanded and approved FDA label for a drug that has a potential market in the US of $3-$5 billion is US yearly sales, and another $3+ Billion in europe (expected euro approval by Q3 2020).  Also going for approval in China, which is another multi-billion dollar market.  So why with all this potential is the stock down $9 from its ATH?   Currently waiting for litigation results....couple of asshats challenged their patent and I expect the court to rule in AMRN\u2019s favor.   I expect a 30%+ gain on when the news breaks....the ruling by the judge is expected by end of march, early April....but can come even sooner.  I also believe this is the last overhang on the stock stopping a major pharmaceutical company (Gilead, Pfizer...etc) from buying this baby out for $35+ or more.    \n\nA One drug biotech company, with an FDA approved drug and a $7-$10 billion potential annual revenue stream....its a larger company\u2019s wet dream.    I may buy weekly calls in the march/april area...$24 price area.", "created_utc": 1581380763, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f1zw3k/amrn_thesis_for_big_2020/", "is_self": true}
