{"id": "g7x5r3", "title": "Repost: Takeda (TAK) DD from your Friendly WSB pharmacist (TAK produces Vyvanse and Adderall XR)", "selftext": "Hey Mods and people who reported me and have now gotten my DD removed multiple times, you suck and are losing out on sweet tendies.  I have updated a little more about product line as requested. Who knew, you people wanted more than a strike price and ticker...jesus, I thought this place was more business and less bull shit!\n\nWhat\u2019s up degenerates? It\u2019s your friendly WSB pharmacist here with some DD. I know most of you retards bet on short term plays and gamble your life savings on SPY puts, but I want to propose a long play that you should hold for a few months and let develop. One thing Wall Street consistently struggles with is the valuation of pharmaceutical stocks. These guys just do not understand strong science (lucky for you, I do)!  Don\u2019t get me wrong, a strong balance sheet always matters; however, sometimes Wall Street puts a little too much weight on how 1-2 bad quarters of debt looks for a pharmaceutical company because they don\u2019t understand the products.\n\nI know, I know\u2026.get to the fucking point guy. Ticker, date, strike. Ok, here, TAK 1/15/21 $20 to $30 calls. Just buy them and thank me later.  No, I do not own a ton of them, I\u2019m not rich enough for a pump and dump scheme.  Yes, I know volume isn't high....I still don't care just buy them and hold because I am literally giving you free money right now.  You're welcome. If you don't trust me because I don't have an extensive history, sorry, you need a pharmacy guy around here.  Let me offer you something besides SPY.\n\nAnyways, I digress, January 2019: Takeda acquires Shire Pharmaceuticals for $62 BILLION. Yes, you read that correct SIXTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS\u2026.HOLY S\\*\\*\\* RIGHT!?!? ([Reference](https://www.takeda.com/newsroom/newsreleases/2019/takeda-completes-acquisition-of-shire-becoming-a-global-values-based-rd-driven-biopharmaceutical-leader/) )\n\nOk, now let\u2019s look at the Takeda ticker:\n\n[TAK 5 YEAR](https://preview.redd.it/b71060h5rgt41.png?width=1324&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;s=f7774906e55150c469845be40e37d500b641c11a)\n\nSo you are looking at a company, who is a MASSIVE conglomerate of 2 incredibly successful pharmaceutical companies...\u2026.with a smaller market cap than Shire as an individual company prior to the merger.  Ok, I know that's not an easy sentence to read and understand, most of you are actually retarded, we have over 1 million here and statistics would likely say we got dumb money and dumb folks here, so what I'm saying is:\n\nIf 1 + 1 = 2, then Takeda + Shire should = ENOURMOUS MARKET CAP THAT IS ADDITIVE IN SOME WAY.\n\nInstead, we have 1 + 1 = 0.9.  Yes, Takeda bought Shire for $62 BILLION, were already successful alone, and now have a Market cap of ~$50-55 BILLION as a super combo company with a stranglehold on lucrative markets like ADHD, IVIg, albumin, etc.  Makes sense.....\n\n**Edit: this is a bit of a hasty generalization. Takeda market cap has continuously sank from \u201cdebt\u201d even with insane revenue. My prediction is that like a Phoenix rising from the ashes Takeda will continue its march upward.**\n[Reference for Market Cap Decline](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Takeda-s-market-value-sinks-9bn-on-weight-of-Shire-buyout) \n\n**Takeda Products:**\n\n* I can't even begin to go into all the products Shire brought to the table, these all belong to Takeda now...check both profiles. \n   * One more try: [Shire Products](https://www.takeda.com/en-us/what-we-do/product-portfolio/) \n* [Takeda's Products](https://www.takeda.com/what-we-do/our-products/). And [Oncology Products](https://www.takedaoncology.com) \n* **If you have ADD/ADHD, you should be happy Takeda exists (lol)**\n   * **They produce Adderall XR AND Vyvanse**...I'm sure most of you degenerates are yiked all day on this stuff\n\n**Takeda Pipeline:**\n\n* Impressive to say the least\n* [TAK Pipeline](https://www.takeda.com/siteassets/system/what-we-do/research-and-development-rd-in-takeda/our-pipeline/qr2019_q3_pipeline_en.pdf)\n* **Plus, they are rapidly expanding their blood/plasma therapeutics area which will help with coronavirus treatments (if needed downstream), IVIg for those of you hip to the lingo.**\n   * [Shitty Bloomberg Reference that fits my case](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-17/takeda-sees-speedy-approval-of-coronavirus-plasma-treatment)\n\nLook, these guys are like if 2 enormous companies you already know of merged to form a super power, except for some reason nobody heard about this Japanese super power pharmaceutical company. They produce commonly used oral anti-hyperglycemics, IVIg, Albumin, and a host of other strong products. \n\nQuarterly earnings for Takeda are 5/13.  Just buy LEAPS or further dated calls and thank me later, they will crush earnings like this bull market has been wrecking my gay bear ass.  Takeda has a phenomenal product line now that Shire's products are owned by Takeda.  They were dealing with a credit downgrade after the acquisition, but have avoided junk ratings (which I find impressive).  In addition, they have divested many \"non-core\" assets to improve the way their finances look for the purposes of helping the share holders ([Reference)](https://www.takeda.com/newsroom/newsreleases/2020/takeda-completes-sale-of-select-otc-and-non-core-assets-to-stada/).  These guys mean business, and I'm thinking price target of $30-$40 after a couple strong quarters if the fed and Donny Pump keep doing their thing.\n\nTAK 1/15/21 Calls.  I bought a 5/15 $12.50 call today for $4.40....lol, I basically got it for the share price.  Go scalp some easy tendies my friends!\n\n**Edit:** grammar and date of earnings. My focus is not pharmaceutical chemistry and science on this one. That is not what\u2019s important. They have a strong worldwide reach with tried and true products from Takeda and Shire. This play is more simple than a promising new drug, even though IVIg is seemingly promising for COVID. \n\n[My current positions I\u2019ll continue to add to](https://imgur.com/a/aLUBSMY)\n\nLook at the links provided, comment and ask questions. I am only pointing you in the right direction and cannot type up an insane DD that breaks down products. Just know they have very big markets on lock and will show high profits for the first time since acquiring Shire in 2019. **Most importantly Takeda now has access to the most profitable and lucrative pharmaceutical market in the world...THE GOOD OLD U-S-A**\n\n*Disclaimer this isn\u2019t financial advice or whatever you\u2019re supposed to say. Never let more than 40% ride on any one move. That\u2019s my one personal rule I stick to going by.\n\n**Positions:** TAK 1/15/21 $20-25c, TAK 6/19 $20c, TAK 5/15 $12.50-15c \n\n**Others Pharma Positions I have**: HALO 5/15 $23-25c, GMAB 5/15 $25c, SNY 6/19 $50c, SGEN 6/19 $155c, QURE 6/19 $70c", "created_utc": 1587834746.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7x5r3/repost_takeda_tak_dd_from_your_friendly_wsb/", "is_self": true}
