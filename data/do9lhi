I own a ton already, but that\u2019s because I think this is the next BYND in terms of hype. Valuation won\u2019t matter for a while and the time value to exp makes these pretty protected in a Downturn. I bought them when it was IPOA. Anyone want to go to the moon with me? \ud83c\udf1d \ud83d\ude80 \n\nPS: these can go to zero and do your own research.
