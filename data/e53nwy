I studied all night and tried to learn the glitch but couldn't really figure out the iron contour shit. But I thought to myself, if it works for iron it could work for calls. \n\nIt fucking did! I was able to put an order in for ten SPY $280 call Dec 06 2019 for $.01!!!!!\n\nFor you noobs and nitwits, the actual retail price is over $32! \n\nTo dumb it down even more for you tards, I was able to put an order in to buy something for $10, that I could easily resell for $32,000.00!!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit 1- Ya'll really don't fucking believe me?
