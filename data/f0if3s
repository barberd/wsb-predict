{"id": "f0if3s", "title": "APT and the Coronavirus", "selftext": "There is a healthcare stock called APT (Alpha Pro Tech) that makes protective gear (face masks). The volume of APT that is being traded, shows the public interest in ongoing epidemics. Normally the volume is about 100k shares/week. 2 weeks ago when the news of the corona outbreak broke, it was traded 26 million times. Last week the interest of the virus was even higher as the stock was traded 33 million times. This week the public interest has gone way down as the stock was only traded 11 million times. \n\nThe volume was rapidly declining this week, hitting it's lowest volume on Wednesday. Most people have stopped caring about the virus, and the media isn't reporting much about it. However, interest in the stock picked up on Thursday and even more on Friday. On Monday next week, the extended holiday offically ends in China, people are supposed to go back to work. A lot of specualtion is being made about the chinese lying about their offical numbers. This doesn't matter since niether the media or the WHO cares. However, if the Chinese are scared of going to work, because of how widespread the virus is, it will affect markets. China is the worlds manufacturing hub, if the factories are closed for too long, we're going to see product shortages severly affecting american corporations which will impact the markets. The increased interest in APT, shows that the market is concerned about supply chain issues that could begin occurring next week. This will have massive negative impact on western markets and I'm guessing were going to see a lot of bad news starting next week. I'm thinking a 5-10% drop, a mini recession. \n\nAPT is not just an index over ongoing epidemics, it's also a great pump and dump.", "created_utc": 1581115832, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f0if3s/apt_and_the_coronavirus/", "is_self": true}
