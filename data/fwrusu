Good Luckin.\"", "selftext": "TL:DR: $IQ 10p 9/18\n\nHi retards, no doubt you are all gnashing and wailing because you didn't buy Luckin Coffee ($LK) puts when the [Muddy Waters short seller thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LKOYMpXVo1ssbWQx8j4G3-strg6mpQ7F/view) was released in Jan 2020. The price was \\~$30/share once the report was released and now it's just over $4 and trading was even halted today. \n\nSo Muddy Waters' mates at Wolfpack Research have published a [short sell report](https://wolfpackresearch.com/iq-netflix-of-china-good-luckin/) on IQYI ($IQ), the key points being:\n\n* **What -** we estimate IQ inflated its 2019 revenue by approximately RMB 8-13 billion, or 27%-44%\n* **How -** IQ does this by overstating its user numbers by 42%-60%. Then, IQ inflates its expenses, the prices it pays for content, other assets and acquisitions in order to burn off fake cash to hide the fraud from its auditor and investors.  \n\nMuddy Waters have since [tweeted](https://twitter.com/muddywatersre/status/1247534498939465731?s=20) they assisted Wolfpack are also short IQ. Just because the Luckin Coffee thesis proved to be correct doesn't mean the IQ report is also true. However, if you have shares of IQ or Baidu ($BIDU, who owns \\~50% of IQ), it could be an opportunity to sell first and ask questions later.\n\nIf you're looking to YOLO, buy puts at least three months out at whatever strike you retards can afford. The Sept $10 puts are $1.70 at the midpoint, if mum hasn't given you enough pocket money you can buy the $2.50 puts as a lotto ticket for $0.27 at the midpoint.", "created_utc": 1586290752.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fwrusu/new_short_idea_iqiyi_the_netflix_of_china_good/", "is_self": true}
