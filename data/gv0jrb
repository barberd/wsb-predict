Vanguard gave me options trading access in my Roth IRA  \n(but only to  **Level 1 =** Write covered calls, purchase protective puts)\n\nWasn't planning on just buying puts/calls in this account so they don't see I'm a complete retard but since **I can only purchase protective puts** I came up with what I will most likely employ tomorrow\n\nPlease tell me if this is fuk\n\n1. Hoping CHWY does well for ER next week (price target of $55 seen below) with little to no DD done\n2. I did some comparison of this strategy vs. straddles/strangles using online options profit calculators and this actually had less risk and more reward potential (but ties up far more capital.. which is why I assume it wouldn't be used professionally but idc)\n3. I made an excel to quickly calculate my risk/reward for the play and can share but idk how\n\nPlan is to..  \n\\-buy 200 shares of CHWY around $45  \n\\-buy two $46p 6/19 contracts to hedge  \n\\-if CHWY goes above $49.30 before 6/19 I start making money  \n\\-if CHWY is below $45.00 at expiry the max I can loose is 6.69% of my investment\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/480nzieicf251.png?width=482&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf87a5a6eb3c399f5fbb3bf722b9c6e5647f7e19\n\nam i dumb??", "created_utc": 1591072463.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gv0jrb/is_my_chwy_play_dumb/", "is_self": true}
