{"id": "gs0hn1", "title": "AAPL's downward spiral in the morning", "selftext": "Welcome to the gay train. Prepare yourself for some to-the-point DD, where one simple day trade will make it rain chicken tenderloins tomorrow.\n\nBottom line up front - AAPL short position to close \\~mid-morning 28MAY.\n\nMoving on, let's take a look at AAPL. We have nearly touched the pre-crash high of 127. In fact, we hit 125 and some change, took a look around, said nah and have been in a descending channel since with lower highs and lower lows. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s4yvfai21g151.png?width=1774&format=png&auto=webp&s=5df8c1c69578e574fb31bf38b39b3f79e4a2b7e1\n\nWhy do we care about technicals with this? It minimizes risk. First, we are in a downtrend, second, we are at the top (resistance) line of our channel, giving plenty of room to continue down.\n\nSo what, many stocks might be in the same situation as this one, why AAPL?\n\nWell, AAPL has a huge exposure to China and the trade war - only giving steam to this downtrend. More importantly however, is that the NPC votes and reports on 28MAY in the evening (morning in the US for those of you who don't know time zone differences). You can check it out here: [https://npcobserver.com/2020/05/22/2020-npc-session-agenda-and-daily-schedule/](https://npcobserver.com/2020/05/22/2020-npc-session-agenda-and-daily-schedule/)\n\nSo what is likely to happen? More trade war doom and gloom between China and the US after media report tomorrow.\n\n**Buy the rumor, sell the news** (and make yourself feel good with technicals while doing so).\n\nPosition: short AAPL stock (looked into apple after market close so could not buy put options).", "created_utc": 1590645111.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gs0hn1/aapls_downward_spiral_in_the_morning/", "is_self": true}
