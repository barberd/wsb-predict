Good afternoon and happy Saturday to all of you on this subreddit. I hope everyone made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week and month of June ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 3rd, 2019.\n\n# **Fed officials and Trump\u2019s latest trade threat could decide whether June starts with a market swoon  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/31/fed-officials-and-trumps-latest-trade-threat-could-decide-whether-june-starts-with-a-market-swoon.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Federal Reserve officials speaking at a policy conference may get a lot more attention than usual in the week ahead after President Donald Trump\u2019s latest tariff threat against Mexico ramped up expectations for interest rate cuts.\n*****\n&gt; Markets will also start the month of June, which is often flat for markets, coming off a painful 6.6% monthly loss in the S&amp;P 500.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks lost ground in May on worries that the U.S. trade war with China would hurt the global economy and bite into earnings growth. They will begin trading in June with new worries that tariffs on Mexico could hurt the economy and threaten a new trade deal between the U.S., Mexico and Canada.\n*****\n&gt; The coming week has a full calendar of economic data, with the highlight being Friday\u2019s May employment report. There are also monthly auto sales and Institute for Supply Management manufacturing data due Monday, and international trade data expected Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; But it is the Fed that should get the most attention, with central bank officials gathering at a much-anticipated conference hosted by the Chicago Fed Tuesday and Wednesday. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will make the opening remarks at the conference, which is about monetary policy strategy, tools and communications. For months, strategists have been hoping the conference will provide insight into how the Fed intends to address sluggish inflation.\n*****\n&gt; Interest in the event is even higher after the market and Fed watchers are increasingly convinced the central bank will now cut rates this year, and maybe more than once. The futures market priced in increasing expectations for two rate cuts after Trump\u2019s threat to put tariffs on all Mexican goods if the Mexican government does not stop immigration into the U.S.\n*****\n&gt; After the last Fed meeting, Powell said low inflation appears to be transitory, suggesting the Fed would not have to cut rates, but markets still anticipate a rate cut, and inflation continues to run below the Fed\u2019s 2% target.\n*****\n&gt; Michael Gapen, Barclays chief U.S. economists, said investors hoping to hear Fed officials discuss their thinking on current policy could be disappointed. Gapen said the Fed is also about nine months away from its decision on how it will frame inflation, and the conference will be more about academic views on it.\n*****\n&gt; Gapen was one of several Wall Street economists Friday who changed his view on the Fed\u2019s rate policy. He said he now sees the Fed cutting the fed funds target rate by 75 basis points in two cuts this year, with the Fed starting at 50 basis points in September. The Fed has said does not foresee any rate cuts this year, nor hikes, and has stressed it is on hold.\n*****\n&gt; Gapen does not expect to hear much from Fed officials at the conference on rates, though investors will be combing through every word looking for policy clues.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s the type of setting where anyone would make a monetary policy comment in advance of an FOMC meeting,\u201d he said. The Fed next meets on June 18 and 19.\n*****\n&gt; Gapen said he went from expecting no Fed move to two rate cuts because the trade war with China has become more extended than expected; manufacturing and business spending are weakening, and because of Trump\u2019s threat to put tariffs on Mexico if it doesn\u2019t control immigrants heading into the U.S. over the southern border.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt does suggest the administration is willing to pursue multiple fronts. It lowers the bar for tariffs on Europe,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Interest rates continued to slide Friday, to multi-year lows. The 2-year yield, which most reflects Fed policy, fell sharply and was at 1.93% in late trading. The 10-year yield, at 2.55% in early May, was at 2.13% Friday afternoon. The S&amp;P 500 was down 2.6% for the week, ending its worst week of the year at 2,752.\n*****\n&gt; Sam Stovall, CFRA chief market strategist, said a \u201cMay mauling usually leads to a boom in June.\u201d Going back to World War II, whenever there was a strong start to the year, the market traditionally fell in May but rose in June. Plus, this year was the third best start through April.\n*****\n&gt; John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington Private Bank, said beyond the trade headlines, there are quite a few market catalysts in June.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cJune is going to be very event-driven. It\u2019s going to be the Fed on June 19. It\u2019s going to be OPEC on June 25; it\u2019s going be the G-20 on June 29,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; He added, \u201cWe\u2019re going to stay balanced and diversified because we don\u2019t know how things are going to come out.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/LB74VfO.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/EqJLZD9.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/qE9e8d6.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/TaaZk9Q.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BMAyj2S.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NbjAxQI.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BcMBAtW.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ueRiDq0.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/8TpsmiK.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/sCnTpIq.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/4IKizen.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/VqLKeCt.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Time For A June Swoon?\n\n&gt; Well, it finally happened. The S&amp;P 500 Index pulled back more than 5% from its all-time high, marking the first 5% pullback of 2019. As we have discussed many times over the past two months, the odds were high that some type of pullback or even correction (10% or more off the highs) was likely after the 25% surge off the December 2018 lows.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/5-Corrections-are-normal.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; May likely will be the first negative month of the year (down nearly 6% with two days to go) and likely will be the first time stocks closed in the red in May since 2012.\n\n&gt; Now, seasonality hints to more volatility ahead, as June doesn\u2019t have the best history for stocks. \u201cWe finally had a 5% pullback, but the bad news is June can be a tricky month for stocks,\u201d explained Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cGoing back the past 20 years, only September has been worse on average, and returns have been quite poor in June after a big drop in May.\u201d\n\n&gt; As our LPL Chart of the day shows, stocks have tended to be weak in June over various periods.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Time-For-A-June-Swoon-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Here are six thoughts to chew on as we turn the calendar:\n\n&gt; * When the S&amp;P 500 has lost 5% in May (like it could in 2019), June\u2019s performance has been weak. May has lost 5% or more only four other times in the past 50 years, and stocks subsequently fell more than 5% in June twice.\n&gt; * However, when the S&amp;P 500 has been up more than 10% year to date heading into June (like it could in 2019), the S&amp;P 500 has gained 9 of the past 12 times (going back 50 years), and has been higher 1.9% on average.\n&gt; * Equity markets in Greece, Brazil, India, Argentina, and Australia are all very strong. If we were truly entering a global recession, we would see more broad-based global weakness.\n&gt; * The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) daily put/call ratio surged to its highest level since late December yesterday, suggesting a good deal of fear is coming into the market \u2013 a necessary recipe for a bottom to form.\n&gt; * Only 31% of the components in the S&amp;P 500 are above their 50-day moving average. This is nearing washout levels, but could need to go down to 20% before the ultimate low can form. Still, we are getting closer.\n&gt; * The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) Investor Sentiment Survey has more than 40% bears, the highest since the start of 2019. That\u2019s another sign fear is spiking, and pessimism could be a bullish contrarian signal.\n\n*****\n\n# DJIA Six Week Losing Streaks\n\n&gt; Barring a 700+ point rally into the close (hey, anything is possible), the DJIA is on pace for its first six-week losing streak since June 2011 and the 32nd such streak going back to 1900. As of this writing, the DJIA is down 6.46% over the course of this current losing streak, which would go down as the mildest six-week losing streak for the index since June 1976 and the fifth 'mildest' six-week losing streak on record. The chart below highlights each of the DJIA's prior six-week losing streaks since 1900 and shows how much the index declined during each one of them.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/053119-Six-Week-losing-Streaks-1.png))**\n\n&gt; While there have been quite a few six-week losing streaks for the DJIA in its history, it is not common for them to go on into a seventh week. As shown in the chart below, just seven of the DJIA's 32 prior six-week losing streaks have last seven or more weeks, and a 7-week losing streak stretching to an eighth week is practically unheard of with just one way back in 1923.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/053119-Length-of-Streaks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# DJIA and S&amp;P 500 Up Six Straight on June\u2019s First Trading Day\n\n&gt; According to the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac 2019 (page 86), the first trading day of June is the sixth best first trading day of all twelve months with DJIA gaining a cumulative 299.85 points since 1998. Over the past 24 years, DJIA\u2019s first trading day of June has produced gains 70.8% of the time with an average gain of 0.04%. Sizable losses in 2002, 2011 and 2012 limit overall performance. S&amp;P 500 has advanced 66.7% of the time. NASDAQ has been slightly weaker at 58.3% as has the Russell 2000 at 62.5%. Following three straight losses from 2010 to 2012, DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have advanced six straight years on the first trading day of June. \n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f08dffab42702e4c1d1ad044b7e29437/tumblr_inline_psc4nrm5l01spdppr_500.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c6cb5f81a46a62c4716a558b813bd6a0/tumblr_inline_psc4o7nDrf1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n&gt; According to the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac 2019 (page 86), the first trading day of June is the sixth best first trading day of all twelve months with DJIA gaining a cumulative 299.85 points since 1998.

Following three straight losses from 2010 to 2012, DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have advanced six straight years on the first trading day of June. \n\n*****\n\n# Typical June Trading: Any Early Gains Tend to Fade\n\n&gt; Over the last twenty-one years, the month of June has been a rather lackluster month for the market. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 have all recorded average losses in the month. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have faired better with modest average gains. Looking at the chart above, shaded areas highlight areas of strength during the month. Historically the month has opened respectably, advancing on the first and second trading days. From there the market then drifted sideways and lower into negative territory just ahead of mid-month. Here the market rallied to create a nice mid-month bulge that quickly evaporated and turned into losses. The brisk, post, mid-month drop is typically followed by a month end rally lead by technology and small-cap. This June could turn out better than average as a result of a strong start to the year and weakness in May.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1e2ae3dda3324aefdf94ef04375f1626/tumblr_inline_psaca0U46w1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Strong Starts Weak Mays Boon for June\n\n&gt; Our previous analysis of big gains the first four months indicated weakness was in store for the merry month of May. Now that the market has indeed suffered this May the outlook for June is a boon at least historically speaking.\n\n&gt; The table below shows the top 20 first four month gains for the for the S&amp;P 500 with the subsequent changes for May, June, Rest of the Year, \u201cWorst Six Months\u201d May-October, 2nd half July-December and full year performance. While most of the full year gains are clearly logged in these big first-four-month gains, there still upside to be had in the latter part of the year.\n\n&gt; May is weakest and May 2019 has delivered market declines so far, down -4.9% for the S&amp;P 500 as of today\u2019s close. However, after big starts, 7 of the 9 subsequent May declines were followed by big gains in June (highlighted in green). So, while we do not anticipate much upside over the next 5 months or so, June is set up for a boon.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f454ab9ac2aad0038bc837ea41f46715/tumblr_inline_ps8iouqkan1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 5/31/19\n\n&gt; This week's economic data came in split down the middle with 12 releases coming in worse than the prior period or estimates and another 12 improving. A remaining 3 met expectations or were unchanged from the previous period. We noted this same pattern in our Matrix of Economic Indicators for April. The FHFA's House Price Purchase Index for the first quarter was the first release of a shortened week coming in unchanged from the previous quarter at 1.1%. Monthly FHFA and Case-Shiller prices also came out on Tuesday with both showing slower home price growth. Later that morning the Conference Board's readings on Consumer Confidence came in stronger than both forecasts and the April reading. The final release Tuesday, the Dallas Fed's Manufacturing Activity, disappointed at -5.3 versus expectations of 6.2. On Wednesday, the Richmond Fed's Manufacturing Activity index also came in below expectations but was stronger than the April reading. The second release of Q1 GDP was revised lower but less than expected with growth for Q1 now sitting at 3.1% QoQ SAAR. While consumption growth was stronger, that came thanks in part to inflation measures falling below estimates. Retail and Inventories grew more than expected in April as seen in their Thursday release. Pending home sales were also notably weak. Friday data was better with Personal Income and Spending numbers both beating estimates. Michigan Sentiment was the final release of the week with a reading of 100.0 versus forecasts of 101.5, both below the 102.4 reported in preliminary data.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/053119-eco.png))**\n\n&gt; With 34 releases, the data slate picks up next week. Monday we will get some important manufacturing data including the final data for May for the Markit PMI and ISM Manufacturing. Revisions for durable goods and the broader factory orders numbers for April will follow up on Tuesday. As next week is the first week of June, on Wednesday ADP will release their employment data for the month of May. This is expected to show fewer jobs created than April. The service portions of Markit PMIs and ISM will also come out Wednesday morning. In addition to the usual Thursday weekly releases, Nonfarm Productivity and Unit Labor Costs for the first quarter are expected. The Employment Situation Report with its Nonfarm Payrolls number will round out the week in economic data on Friday morning.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/053119-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for May 31st, 2019** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymMbRqxdpEE))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 06.02.19** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfVusKsaoKI))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$CRM** \n&gt; * **$GES** \n&gt; * **$CLDR** \n&gt; * **$SFIX** \n&gt; * **$BOX** \n&gt; * **$MDB** \n&gt; * **$TIF** \n&gt; * **$CIEN** \n&gt; * **$COUP** \n&gt; * **$FIVE** \n&gt; * **$CBRL** \n&gt; * **$AEO** \n&gt; * **$DOCU** \n&gt; * **$CPB** \n&gt; * **$SMAR** \n&gt; * **$GME** \n&gt; * **$APPS** \n&gt; * **$CTK** \n&gt; * **$ZM** \n&gt; * **$NAV** \n&gt; * **$AMBA** \n&gt; * **$DOMO** \n&gt; * **$DCI** \n&gt; * **$UNFI **\n&gt; * **$GWRE** \n&gt; * **$SJM** \n&gt; * **$CAL** \n&gt; * **$SAIC** \n&gt; * **$PVTL** \n&gt; * **$SIG** \n&gt; * **$CSWC** \n&gt; * **$HOME** \n&gt; * **$OESX** \n&gt; * **$GIII** \n&gt; * **$VRA** \n&gt; * **$CMD** \n&gt; * **$ESTC** \n&gt; * **$BYND** \n&gt; * **$KIRK** \n&gt; * **$OLLI** \n&gt; * **$HQY**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/b30y3HX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/qP2CRt9.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/3vQgZJ8.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.3.19 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0D1cVCl.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.3.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/tvXXY3n.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.4.19 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qctO3vv.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.4.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QB6PJGD.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.5.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ulgo7hq.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.5.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dLxYrTw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.6.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/K3aWFRI.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.6.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/k7fmTdc.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.7.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.7.19 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $151.41 \n&gt; **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, June 4, 2019.
