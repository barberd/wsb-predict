{"id": "gjsxqt", "title": "$KR - Tendies for the Tendieman", "selftext": "I'm all in on Kroger.  This is going to go nuts over the next few weeks, leading up to anticipate earnings around 6/18.  Here's why:\n\nStock jumped in mid march pricing in the panic buying then followed the market down.  The lockdown has lasted much, much longer than anyone expected and most people/families have been eating three square meals a day at home (not to mention stress eating).  Price peaked in March at $34.19 and just started revisiting that level yesterday but I don\u2019t believe that two and a half months of every person in America grocery shopping for themselves and their families for every meal has been close to priced in.\n\nDespite the economy re-opening, restaurants are taking much longer and in many cases only doing take out/pick up.  If they are open, they are at limited capacity.  The hospitality industry is expecting reduced sales through Q1 of next year.  Again, this means eating at home and a sustained bump in sales.\n\nKR has spent the last 6 years making big moves to automated factories and bolstering online ordering.  Obviously this was in response to Amazon/whole foods but it also means that KR was ready to fully capitalize on the conditions presented by the shutdown.\n\nAlso, They just gave their CEO a fucking raise.  During the middle of a fucking pandemic.   19% with a $2.7mil bonus (7.5x last year\u2019s cash award).  Wonder what drove that conversation?\n\nBad news is good news for Kroger.  2nd wave? Hotspots? All good for Kroger.\n\nThere are macro trends at play here that may or may not affect sales long term:  unemployment, and a shift away from going out as well as a people genuinely enjoying cooking for themselves.\n\nShit is on sale today.\n\n$KR 37c 6/19\n\n$KR 38.5c 6/26", "created_utc": 1589483747.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gjsxqt/kr_tendies_for_the_tendieman/", "is_self": true}
