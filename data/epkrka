{"id": "epkrka", "title": "Long position success", "selftext": "This past summer, after I purchased a ton of BYND at IPO and sold at $200, my account was absolutely booming and my confidence was dangerously high. I was stoked on IPO\u2019s so I knew what I had to do, I put all my gains into the next summertime IPO, CRWD. I purchased as many as I could at $72 and planned to hold a long position until $100. Well, the highest I ever saw that stock go was $99 and I ended up blowing up my portfolio when I sold them at $53. But, as a recovery I saw AMD, I hedged for success with a few blue chips as back ups and bought a ton of AMD as my growth stock and told myself I\u2019d sell at $50. Well I started to get a little scared when I saw it stagnant in the high 40\u2019s and felt a blow up for my portfolio was again imminent.... But no, not this time! Those boys are sold at the target price!... (and yes, I do believe AMD is going to dip after today and when that happens I will open another position in it. AMD 2020!!)", "created_utc": 1579188345, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/epkrka/long_position_success/", "is_self": true}
