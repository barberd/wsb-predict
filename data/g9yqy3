{"id": "g9yqy3", "title": "lucky dumbass", "selftext": " holy hell these past two months have been quite a roller coaster. when the market started going down in late February the obvious decision was to put it all in that piece of shit triple leveraged S&P ETF known as $SPXL like the dumbass i am. that single position cost me over 20k. i was in Walt Disney World with my girlfriend the very last day it was open before i panic sold that crap for a loss. I felt so autistic and she said that i should go to gambling rehab. There were no options left; except that i could yolo what i had left with another 15k borrowed from good 'ole TD Ameritrade to break even on $BA in 3 days. So that's exactly what i did and that's exactly what happened. i had no one to thank but the printer. My losses were regained but it wasn't enough. Luckily, i'm still retarded... so i put 20k $BAC, and proceeded to borrow roughly 20k for $DFS and 18k for $CTAS, but why not another 6k for $NAT cause yolo bitches. anyhow, retard or not, i now have more liquidity than i did at the beginning of this nonsense. i guess i should sell and just be glad i didnt lose my entire college fund \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/khrauubgdnv41.jpg?width=2997&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c278c6d785841c78c7da59727ccd4ad7f27785d3", "created_utc": 1588118272.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9yqy3/lucky_dumbass/", "is_self": true}
