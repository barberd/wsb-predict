{"id": "g1i94f", "title": "Let's talk about going LONG on OIL...", "selftext": "Sure, the market overall is green as fuck and rational puts are getting ravaged, but one industry that is still massively down with little recovery in sight is the energy market. The WSB smart money has already been watching and even betting on the oil markets. This is an important long-term play for major easy tendies, in my humble (retarded) opinion.\n\nIf the overall market did truly bottom (which I doubt but I'm also retarded), oil is the last chance to get some seriously cheap purchases in. We don't even need to worry too much about perfectly timing the bottom on oil... we are either at or near enough to it to not care in a multiyear timeframe. You very likely may never see gas at $1.70 a gallon again for the rest of your life.\n\nThe difficult question is this: HOW to properly play the oil market? The goto USO ETF, quite simply, looks like DOG SHIT. I know many of you rely on it, but it's a shit ETF at the end of the day. Contango on it is a major bitch, and USO has underperformed oil price movements over the long term. It's performance will only get worse over time. We need something better than this if we want to maximize gains.\n\nWe can trade companies like Exxon directly, but even those are subject to market BRRRR and are still outperforming crude oil prices. Still a good bet, but probably not optimal. You can literally buy thousands of barrels of oil but bitch you don't own a fucking oil reservoir.\n\nI've got my personal ideas on plays of course, but still open to new and possibly smarter bets. So let's hear it, what are some long-term energy plays the less autistic and retarded among us are making?\n\nEDIT: Jesus I underestimated the retardation on this sub...", "created_utc": 1586913685.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1i94f/lets_talk_about_going_long_on_oil/", "is_self": true}
