The GAP is a discount clothing retailer that operates large physical footprint stores across the USA and other countries.\n\nI am looking at this primarily from a TA perspective:\n\nBearish arguments:\n\n[lower high formed on 5\\/29 - the stock has been stuck in a $7-9 channel since early April.  It is attempting a breakout above 10 but I believe it will fail.](https://preview.redd.it/gd7ncuyq1c251.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=42ef739d641b2ab800c3c12972ce2816441e0761)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Stochs indicate overbought condition.

GPS' immediate catalyst today, 6/1/20, is due to a JPM upgrade to Neutral - see below:\n\n*\" J.P. Morgan analyst Matthew Boss boosted his rating on        Gap to Neutral from Underweight, and raised his price target by $4        to $11. He notes that Gap stock (ticker: GPS) has tumbled some        70% since October, and the upgrade is largely due to this fact, which        has left the shares trading below other troubled retailers.*\n\n*On an EV/Ebitda (enterprise value to earnings before interest, taxes,        depreciation and amortization) basis, Boss pegs the current \"distressed        retail\" trough-multiple average around 0.43 times. If Gap's Old Navy        brand could hit that level (and its Athleta brand could outperform) the        shares wouldn't need any contribution from Banana Republic or        the flagship Gap brand to get to an equity value of $14 a        share.*\n\n*Old Navy has long been key to Gap's success (and the stock        jumped after the cancelation of its spinoff). The brand accounts for        about half of Gap's sales and around 80% of the company's Ebit. Of        course, the current environment hasn't been kind to apparel retailers,        as many consumers pull back on all but essentials (and don't need many        new clothes when leaving the house is frowned upon). Yet within this        framework, Old Navy looks better positioned than most, Boss opines, as        it is squarely in the value category -- and the brand performed well in        2009 when the U.S. began to exit the Great Recession. Old Navy        may further get a boost from the fact that it has many off-mall        locations, and the fact that it does a brisk business in kids and baby        items (areas where consumers have less option to hold off on buying new        clothes).*\n\n*The shares have slipped more than 42% since the start of the year, but        were struggling even before the coronavirus hit. The fact that the        shares are responding so favorably to an upgrade that isn't even a call        to buy shows how starved Gap investors are for good news. A $14        equity value isn't the same as saying the stock will reach $14        -- especially as Gap has moved away from plans to break out its        faster-growing brands. Yet investors likely welcome the theory that the        shares have finally been oversold.*\n\n*Write to Teresa Rivas at* [*teresa.rivas@barrons.com*](mailto:teresa.rivas@barrons.com)\n\n*(END) Dow Jones Newswires   06-01-20 1127ET \"*\n\n**TLDR: GPS deserves to be trading in the $7-9 range.  Sell any rally.  Why target 7/17?  Just to be safe.  The stock has a high chance of disappointing after earnings.
