Robinhood doesn\u2019t seem to be lending shares (or paying for shares they are lending) for locates post APEX conversion.\n\n\nFriendly reminder to those with a real brokerage account and shit stock in your account or even not shit stock but heavily shorted stock - looking at the 'special people' hoping to catch the next short squeeze, explore enrolling in your brokers 'fully paid lending' program.  If it doesn\u2019t auto enroll you at account opening make sure you talk to your broker and make sure your being paid if your shares are being borrowed.  Either way talk to your broker - sometimes you can get better rates.\n\nWTF is fully paid securities lending??  People who want to go short on a stock have to find shares to borrow to short.  Firms loan out shares (your shares) and receive interest on them when they are actually being borrowed (actually shorted - not just located).  Brokers are now 'willing' to give 'investors' a taste of this action.   This might sound familiar to the few who have heard  of a bank or watched that Christmas movie where the dude loses his shit and goes on a bender when everyone wants their money out of his savings and loan.\n\n\nThe interest you receive can vary greatly depending on need of those shares and normally changes daily.  Blue apron is a good example of always needed shit.  Borrow daily average rate was lower after positive earnings but still ~ 110 last Friday.  TLRY was over 700 in January but this is not normal and you can lose your shit if you are trying to chase this.  And no you will not get 100% of that rate.\n\n\nSigning up for fpl does change some things (even though your shares are already being used without them telling you - technically they did tell you).  You should read the fine print on your account docs.  You won\u2019t because this is wsb and because risk is the only four letter word you couldn\u2019t figure out how to spell while playing scrabble with your nan in your gilf fantasy but I digress.  You still own the stock and can sell it at anytime.  In general, you don\u2019t have voting rights, you get dividends but they are not taxed like dividends because they aren\u2019t technically dividends and SiPC can tell you to fuck off.\n\n\nThis info is an option to supplement returns on a strategy taking long positions on equities.  It should not be the strategy.  Most ETFs are doing the same. Everyone should do their own research and make their own investment decisions.  You do you.\n\n\nEnjoy your tendies while you bag hold.", "created_utc": 1565582463, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cp75mz/perma_bag_holders_are_you_maximizing_your_return/", "is_self": true}
