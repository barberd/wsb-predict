MSGS and MSGE", "selftext": "Last month Madison Square Garden Company completed the spinoff of MSG Entertainment (which operates Madison Square Garden and other venues) and renamed itself MSG Sports (which owns the New York Rangers and New York Knicks sports teams).\n\nWhy?\n\nMSGS \u2014\n\n1) Sports are not going away\n2) Strong balance sheet and the market cap right now is at around $4 billion\n3) Estimates pre-COVID were that the New York Knicks are the most valuable NBA franchise at around $4 billion. New York Rangers were valued around $1.5 to $2 billion. \n4) IV is reasonable \n5) It\u2019s a sports franchise\n6) It\u2019s a sports franchise \n\nMSGE\u2014\n\nThe Company presents or hosts a broad array of events in its diverse collection of venues: New York\u2019s Madison Square Garden, Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden, Radio City Music Hall and Beacon Theatre; and The Chicago Theatre. MSG Entertainment is also building a new state-of-the-art venue in Las Vegas, MSG Sphere at The Venetian, and has announced plans to build a second MSG Sphere in London.\n\nWhy?\n\n1) Same as MSGS but more interesting items below\n2) Market cap is around $2 billion. Per latest filing Company believes it is well positioned to navigate through this temporary shutdown. As of May 1, 2020, MSG Entertainment had approximately $1.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, including the net proceeds from the sale of the Forum. So, they have $1.4 billion of cash plus all of the real estate assets. I\u2019m pretty sure the real estate is worth more than $0.6 billion.\n3) This is what they are building in Vegas right now \u2014 www.msgsphere.com\n\n\u201cThe Edge Consulting Group, who doesn\u2019t own direct stakes in either stock. At current market prices, he says, MSGS is trading at about a 30% discount to its net asset-based valuation while MSGE is trading at a nearly 50% discount.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m bullish and have leaps. But could also be a good delta neutral IV play.\n\nOnly thing to watch out for is the bid/ask spreads.", "created_utc": 1591933067.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h7d9d3/this_is_the_next_real_estate_sports_play_msgs_and/", "is_self": true}
