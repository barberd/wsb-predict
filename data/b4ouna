I have a job now where I can pretty easily max out an IRA each year and feel like that's a good goal to start with, and maybe even more.\n\nSo, who all do you use for your Roth IRA provider? I'm looking to trade in it somewhat actively (selling covered calls, etc. Nothing crazy), but beyond that I just want to buy ETFs and what not.\n\nThus far I've mostly just lost money in RH, so I'm not sure who has the best offerings for someone in my scenario.\n\nSuggestions?
