I made a killing on my SPY and AAPL puts today by buying them at the very top of Wednesday\u2019s spike. Thank fuck I had already exited all of my short positions otherwise I would have been salty as hell over the weekend. \n\nI was watching VIX plummet and figured that was about as much reassurance that I was going to get and took the gamble.\n\nBought up 50 random SPY FD calls for $18,300 and sold them less than 5 minutes later for $21,600 lol. Quickest $3,300 I've ever made.  \n\nBeing the Bear Gang OG that I am - I immediately took that profit and rolled it into 3/13 $297 SPY Put\u2019s lololol\n\n[https://imgur.com/NAyQbTT](https://imgur.com/NAyQbTT)\n\n[https://imgur.com/6WkdFvh](https://imgur.com/6WkdFvh)", "created_utc": 1583531876.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fel039/flipping_the_eod_spike/", "is_self": true}
