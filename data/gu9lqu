{"id": "gu9lqu", "title": "Tendies against Police Brutality", "selftext": "I'm going to try to keep this as apolitical as possible to abide by the rules. I also have no idea if something like this has been done already and I'm just too lazy to find it, if so, downvote me until the Vote Nazi Bot deletes this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRegardless of views on protests, riots, and looting I think there's a pretty universal opinion that cops killing unarmed people = bad. As such I was planning on donating to Urban Zero, a group that tries to advise policy decisions to reduce police brutality through data driven research. But donating by itself is kinda boring so let's make a retarded investing game out of it. I have some money left in Robinhood after cashing in on the March crash, I want some of you retards to give me a play. Two rules: not a daytrade because I'm PDT locked, and not on a super pricey stock because I don't have a ton left in there. I'll pick my favorite play and make it. If it works out, I'll donate the winnings. If it goes tits up, I'll still donate some.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyone else who would like to join in this little game, feel free to do so, the more money to the cause the better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Give me plays. I bet. If it goes good: I donate tendies. If it goes bad: I donate some anyway.
