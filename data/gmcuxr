If the limit of detection (LOD) for a test is\u00a0 too high, patients who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 may not test positive, leading to a high rate of false-negative results. If the LOD for a test is too low, then contamination can become a major problem, as the test will detect the tiniest amounts of viral RNA, leading to false-positive test results (i.e., people who are not infected with SARS-CoV-2 will test positive instead of negative). The art of determining how much viral RNA detected in a person is clinically significant, and therefore the target LOD for an accurate test, is just that...an art.\n\nWould like to hear thoughts of a medical professional if you are in this sub thanks!\n\n[https://www.iowapublicradio.org/post/state-lab-continues-double-check-test-iowa-results#stream/0](https://www.iowapublicradio.org/post/state-lab-continues-double-check-test-iowa-results#stream/0)\n\n[https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/04/30/this-is-potential-public/](https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/04/30/this-is-potential-public/)\n\nMeanwhile, some experts have raised questions as to the accuracy of the Co-Diagnostics test used at the TestUtah sites.\n\nShares in Co-Diagnostics tripled in late February, when it received certification to sell its coronavirus test in Europe. On April 3, the day the state signed its contract with Nomi, Co-Diagnostics received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to sell its test in the United States.\n\nNow the company is supplying thousands of tests in Iowa and Nebraska, where state officials last week issued no-bid contracts worth more than $50 million to Nomi and the TestUtah team.\n\nBut the Co-Diagnostics test has a \u201chigher limit of detection compared to tests offered by more established vendors,\u201d Lopansri wrote, referring to the test\u2019s sensitivity. A higher limit of detection means more virus is required in a sample to trigger a positive result.", "created_utc": 1589844353.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gmcuxr/codiagnostics_codxs_testing_kit_accuracy_and/", "is_self": true}
