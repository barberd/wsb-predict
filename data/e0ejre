Is there literally no way to invest in this company, I know at least half of all you autists will be buying this membership. Every single person participating in NNN will lose on Black Friday. In 2018 alone, \n\u201cPornhub\u2019s amateurs, models and content partners uploaded an incredible 4.79 million new videos, creating over 1 million hours of new content to enjoy on the site. If you were to start watching 2018\u2019s videos after the Wright brother\u2019s first flight in 1903, you would still be watching them today 115 years later!\u201d (Pornhub).\nThis will literally be the best investment ever. I\u2019ll never participate in NNN ever again. My social, work, and family life are about to suffer drastically. \n\n*If anyone at Pornhub is reading this please sell me your pre-ipo shares.*", "created_utc": 1574492906, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e0ejre/long_porn/", "is_self": true}
