What companies will be least effected by supply chain issues.  Which companys are going to be profiting most from this economic melt down ahead.  Who do you all think is really going to shine come the next bull run?  \n\nI only have normie things in mind like, well netflix is probably not gonna lose any subscribers, MSFT sells software mostly, People can still use facebook when they are sick, Google gonna google, People are gonna go to Disney when it re opens, Six flags might go out of business or be purchased by disney, Seaworld could and hopefully fucking dies because who cares about that place, people will start to go back to hilton, marriot hotels, etc, LYV might fucking die because who the fuck is LYV really?  People still gonna fly but Boeing is most likely to get bailed out according to some autist, People will start taking ubers or lyft again, one of them might die though, people will start going to cracker barrel again of couse.  The list goes on.\n\nThoughts on JNJ going huge?  People gonna be making babies right now for sure.  Nothing to do but fuck and watch netflix for a while and cvs was all out of condoms or they were closed so fuck it.\n\nWHOES GOING TO THE FUCKING MOON BESIDES SPCE OF COURSE.\n\nThanks in advanced, I love reading everyones ideas.
