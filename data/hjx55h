{"id": "hjx55h", "title": "5G Plays - ERIC and NOK", "selftext": "Regardless of the nutcases burning down cell towers and buying Shungite, 5G is coming, and there's two companies that are poised to build out alot of infrastructure: Ericsson and Nokia.\n\nHere's what Im thinking:\n\nSince the whole CCP/Huawei drama, telcos are shying away from using their gear for 5G infrastructure. Ericsson is building out most of Bell, Telus and Rogers (Canadian) 5G networks. [See here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bell-canada-ericsson-5g-idUSKBN2391ZV) and [here](https://business.financialpost.com/telecom/bell-canada-picks-ericsson-as-5g-supplier-amid-huawei-uncertainty-2). Ericsson also just signed on with Korea Telecom [(here)](https://www.ericsson.com/en/press-releases/2019/3/ericsson-wins-5g-commercial-deal-with-kt#:~:text=KT%20%28formerly%20known%20as%20Korea%20Telecom%29%20has%20awarded,5G%20services%20in%20Korea%20starting%20early%20April%202019) and Germany [(here)](https://www.theregister.com/2020/06/02/ericsson_o2_germany_5g/). There are some others as well but you can see for yourself. Nokia and Ericsson are gonna make bank.\n\nFor some mid-July tendies, get ERIC 10c 7/17. Stock price has risen slowly and is 9.25-9.50, they also have an [earnings call](https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/ERIC) on 7/17 so you can make some money on the lead up and sell before end of day when they go ITM.\n\nNokia I would say 5c 8/21 or maybe a weekly if you are more into those. Nokia has an [earnings call](https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/NOK) on 7/23 as well.\n\nBoth of these are good long term investments but Im here to gamble so its ERIC 10c 7/17 for me since calls are cheap and earnings call coming up should be juicy given the amount of contracts they took in recently.\n\n**TL;DR - 5G easy money Ericsson and Nokia, literally cant go tits up, positions below.**\n\n**ERIC 10c 7/17**\n\n**NOK 5c 8/21**", "created_utc": 1593697035.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hjx55h/5g_plays_eric_and_nok/", "is_self": true}
