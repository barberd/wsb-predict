You might remember me from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fopuyx/daddy_where_does_money_come_from_birds_bees_long/), or for the more enthusiastic of you, from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fplquv/something_fishy_fuzzys_seas_covenant_breakdown/).\n\nToday in the neighborhood we're going to talk about $F. I know a lot of you smooth-brained autists struggled with the complexity of my post on $SEAS (even though I painstakingly pointed out that you could have seen [this](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/seaworld-entertainment-to-furlough-more-than-90-of-staff-as-of-april-1-because-of-coronavirus-2020-03-27) coming 3 months ago and gave precise instructions on how you can do it for yourself next time), so I'm going to keep this one short and sweet. Today we're talking about high-yield and investment grade bond debt, credit ratings, and what that means for $F's equity pricing.\n\n\"But why $F, Fuzzy?\". Because I'm a red-blooded patriot and I'm passionate about great American institutions. Specifically, I'm passionate about stripping them for parts and profit. I do it for a living - what could be more fucking American than that?\n\nSeriously though, it's because $F today joined the infamous ranks of 'fallen angels' - issuers of high-yield bond debt that was initially given an **investment-grade (\"IG\") rating** by a rating agency but that is subsequently reduced to **junk status**. Bad news for the noteholders (people that own the bonds); good news for you. And I'm here to tell you why.\n\nBefore we get going, I say it every time, but u/pokimane, if you're in the building, you can skip this shit and just HMU directly for a one on one explanation. I'll waive my usual fee. For the rest of you, read on - or if you want to cheat, I'm going to break my own rule and give you a TL;DR. To the nerds, don't worry - I'll still give links to the documents so you guys can read them if you want to. You actually did a pretty impressive job on $SEAS. If you don't want to read them, that's fine too. Your mom and I are proud of you either way.\n\n**TL;DR** \\- $F issued bonds to investors under the assumption they would remain an American institution that literally couldn't go tits up. Spoiler alert: it went tits up. That sexy IG debt that started out looking like ScarJo in *Don Jon* is now deeply unsexy junk debt that looks like ScarJo in *Marriage Story*. They can probably refinance it with even more expensive debt, but they're likely to default within the next 6 months either way. Bad times for the company's balance sheet could mean green lines on Robinhood for you.\n\nIf you want to learn how to fish instead of stuffing yourself at the sushi bar, here's why this happened and what it means. I'm going to break this post into three parts. **(1) Bonds (2) Bonds and Credit Ratings (3) $F.** Skip to (3) if you just want the explanation of why this matters for $F, obviously.\n\nStrap in. Let's get started.\n\n**(1) Bonds.**\n\nBonds are a form of corporate debt instrument popular with large companies. Rather than borrowing money from a bank, you issue - either privately to a specific investor or through a public placement to whoever wants to buy them - an IOU to the market. \"I promise, on penalty of having Mommy take my Switch away, to pay you $100 in 7 years time\". So far, so easy, right? But why would anyone buy that? The hook is that you sell the debt for less than what it's worth. It works like this: \"**If you pay me $99 now,** I'll pay you $100 in 7 years. PLUS I'll pay you interest in the meantime\". In bond-land, the interest is called a coupon.\n\nThese are liquid instruments that can be traded like stocks in closed markets or on the public exchange. Important note: Bonds also contain rules called covenants that limit what other shit you can do while you're walking around town with someone else's cash only secured by your word (**unsecured bonds**) or by your shit (**secured bonds**).\n\n**(2) Bonds and Credit Ratings.**\n\nJust like people (notwithstanding what your mom and I told you growing up), not all bonds are created equal. Some get issued by great companies, some get issued by shitty companies. Bonds that are issued by great companies have loose covenants that let them do whatever they want, and a cheap coupon because they're low risk. Bonds issued by shitty companies have tighter covenants and a more expensive coupon. This is why shitty bonds are often referred to as **high-yield debt** (the 'yield' is how much they make for investors in terms of a coupon - more coupon, higher yield). The way investors can tell the difference is by something called a 'credit rating'.\n\nCredit ratings are literally a letter grade that gets applied to your company's debt to tell investors how trustworthy you are. There are three main players - Fitch, S&P, and Moody's. [Here's a handy-dandy chart that shows you what the letters mean.](https://wolfstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/US-credit-ratings-scale-Moodys-SP-Fitch.png) The big scam in the industry is that YOU as the issuer of the debt pay to get it rated. That's not really relevant here but it's interesting to know.\n\nAnyway, if you issue debt that gets an IG rating, you get primo treatment. You pay less interest, you get more cash upfront, you get name brand investors. You get bottle service at the bank (seriously - I've seen this happen), and that cute secretary in the white shirt and pencil skirt with seamed stockings says \"Hello, Mr. Fuzzy\" when you walk by. Life is sweet. For junk bond issuers, not so much. You get shitty amounts of cash up front, you pay a lot of interest for the privilege, and the cute secretary is replaced by a leather-bound debt collector leering at you from the corner of the room.\n\nThis is the way of the world. The problem is when the natural order gets upset. See, the thing is, the rules get set **up-front**. You get the rating, sell the debt, get the perks (or otherwise). BUT, if you get a great rating, then it all goes to shit - the noteholders (the people who own your debt) are in trouble. They are now bagholders. They're giving you all the perks for none of the security. **That's what happened here**.\n\n**(3) $F.**\n\nDearborn, Michigan. 1992. Life is sweet - at least, as sweet as it can be in suburban Detroit. You're the CEO of Ford. Congratulations! You just signed an [Indenture](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/37996/0000950124-95-003826.txt) \\- a magic bond-making machine that prints money. Over the next 20 years, you make the money printer go brr brr and spit out a few billion dollars in sexy, IG securities. But then, things change. People don't like your cars anymore. They want the sexy new European model (my personal preference). Or something small and Asian (horses for courses, I guess). Or maybe they don't even want a car anymore (maniacs and New Yorkers only). The stock price slides. You start awake, drenched in sweat, screaming \"MUSK\". It's March 27, 2020. 9am. The phone rings. It's the bank. You've been downgraded to junk. Shit. This doesn't happen often, and when it does, it's bad.\n\nWhat does this mean? See, while the good times rolled, $F issued literally billions of dollars in high grade IG bonds, assuming they'd never have any issue refinancing them or being able to pay them back. The problem is that now, they probably won't be able to. No one buys their cars, their profits have continued to slide for years, and they've shut every factory they have world-wide because of the bat-flu. Even a cheap coupon looks expensive when you don't have any cash coming in. There might not even be a market for any bonds they have the temerity to issue.\n\nSo, this begs the question. What happens now? How can they pay this shit back? Well, I did the leg-work for you and read these docs this evening.  There is a general secured debt basket in the bonds to the tune of 5% of \u201cConsolidated Net Tangible Automotive Assets\u201d that allows debt secured by liens on \"Principal Domestic Manufacturing Property\" or the stock or debt of a \"Manufacturing Subsidiary\" without equally and ratably securing the $F Bonds. In English? The rules are loose enough to let them go out and get some new debt if they secure it using some of their primo subsidiaries - and they don't have to offer the same benefits to the existing bond holders. It's capped at 5% of $F's shit after you adjust the numbers.\n\nSo, reading the [10-K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/37996/000003799620000010/0000037996-20-000010-index.htm), if the Company reported assets (excluding \"Ford Credit\") of approximately $102 billion at December 31, 2019. After adjustments this is more like $50 billion. This gives us a corresponding new debt carveout of approximately $2.8 billion (5% of $50 billion or so). Now, that's not all - there's extra wiggle room by jumping through some legal hoops. But let's skip that for now and stick to the easy stuff.\n\nThey can get $2.8 billion or so in new debt to service several billion dollars worth of outstanding notes. The new debt they get **will not be cheap**.  In fact, it will be **super expensive (if they can even get it)**. They absolutely, 100%, will not be able to service it. They will incur it only as a stop-gap to prevent from defaulting on their major debt obligations they incurred during the gravy train years. These defaults will come, and, barring a bail-out (highly unlikely for the auto industry - twice in a decade would be asking a lot), will decimate the company.\n\n**TL;DR** \\- Do whatever you want with the above. Read the post and use your noodle.\n\n**EDIT 1:** Once again, let me be clear. I do not advocate a specific position on this ticker. I read their debt documentation and their 10-K and posted my perspective only. This is **not** DD that is telling you what to do. I do not personally know one way or the other if a bailout will happen or not. No one does. Bake that into your own risk calculus. Use your noodle.
