{"id": "elhnsk", "title": "MTL(Mechel) DD", "selftext": "So, I saw a top mover this week was Mechel. A Russian owned precious metals company. They jumped 30%, so I started to do a little research. Seems like this company is 7.6b dollars in debt, is having it's factories, forges and warehouses are being sezied by the Kremlin and is forcing bankruptcy for sure. The stock is going u0, and has been for the past few years, but honestly aren't these all tell tale signs that I should buy long puts? I feel like this company is going to tank, any opinions?", "created_utc": 1578430814, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/elhnsk/mtlmechel_dd/", "is_self": true}
