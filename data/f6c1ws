{"id": "f6c1ws", "title": "The Anti Theta Gang", "selftext": "\n\nThe anti theta gang\n\nSo everyone here has seen a bajillion posts about how theta gang is constantly selling OTM options to a bunch of degenerate gamblers? How would you like to wipe the smug grins off of their faces? Short Vol? Who needs it? this strategy is long vol, and it's gonna print money. You heard it hear first.\n\nSo the prototypical theta gang strategy is the iron condor. That's a short call spread and a short put spread outside of the strike price. The name of the game is keep the strikes OTM and let time do it's magic. These guys are short vol because they don't want the UL to move around to much. If the UL stay put, you make all that sweet sweet premium.\n\nBut what if I told you that there is another way to generate weekly income? Think of it as Theta Gang's bastard cousin. Or slutty sister. You're gonna buy some premium. You are long Vol. Here's they play you autists.\n\nThe UL is the SPX.\nThe expiration is March 14th (14 days)\n\nSell 3370 put\nbuy  3380 put\nbuy  3385 call\nsell 3395 call\n\nThe total cost this morning for this play was 9.10. Max win is 90 bucks. The SPX has to expire basically 1% in either direction in 2 weeks. Which lets be honest, what are the odds is stays completely put for 2 weeks? The UL moves at all and KABOOM. You are long theta. And you are diversified if all you do are iron condors.\n\nAnd your secret weapon is immediately after putting this play on, you're gonna set s GTC order for 9.65. You can make 5 % in two weeks. 5% x 52 equals 250% in a year. \n\nYou can turn a 1000 bucks into 2500 in one year and get yourself a degree at the community college and get off your mama's couch in one year.\n\nIn all seriousness. I'm a dumbshit on the internet and want to see if someone can poke a hole in my fool proof, non dumbshit, cannot fail money printing machine. If you can, I'm all ears. If anyone needs me, I'm gonna go back to eating glue.", "created_utc": 1582125337, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6c1ws/the_anti_theta_gang/", "is_self": true}
