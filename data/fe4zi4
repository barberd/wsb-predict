And it was more than one person.  She suggested we put all of money in cash.\n\nI politely explained than I was buying puts to hedge against the stock losses, and that our account is actually up tree fiddy now.  (I always say \"even\" or \"up a little\". The actual swings would frighten her).\n\nAfter explaining to her how put options work, she said if that was true then everybody would be buying put options.  I explained that most people don't know about put options and instead are over at r/investing trying to find the best time to buy the dips.\n\nShe said, \"Wow\".  I then let her know that I was leaving to go hang out with some guys.  Now I'm feeling really gay.  Gonna go get some tendies now.
