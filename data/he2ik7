{"id": "he2ik7", "title": "Taking the advice from the last week", "selftext": "2 weeks ago I made more money than I had ever made in my life (60k in 3 days). At this time I was also studying for my mortgage brokerage license along with planning for my new future since I had been laid off in March. \n\nInstead of pulling all the money out I decided to go for more. I would buy 200 contracts at a time and take profits at about 5%-10%. This worked consistently and I was up another 10k. I was so excited, was going to get a new car, the girlfriend and I could finally have the down payment for the house, I had enough money to have an actual savings along with this great new job once I pass the test. \n\nThen I was brought back to reality. I lost all but 10k in a single day when I chased a bunch of plays when JP was speaking. Then without thinking I threw the last 10k into a fucking yolo play in hopes I could get back the losses. Looking back, I don\u2019t know what I was thinking that day. I revenge traded for the second half of it and I know that.\n\nThe yolo of course didn\u2019t pay off when the market dropped 5% overnight. My account that I worked up to around 70k was now $550. Now to top it off, the following day was my mortgage broker test which of course I was so fucked in the head that I failed.\n\nFlash forward to now. The things I was dreaming and excited about are all gone. I have lost the will to live and I understand what some of these people talk about.\n\nI have already reached out and gotten the help I will need so I don\u2019t go through with what I was thinking. But before I probably don\u2019t have access to the internet for a bit I wanted to share this with anyone else who is in my boat. \n\nGet the help you need, and if you\u2019re ever up an insane amount, take it all out and be happy with what you got. \n\nAnd last but not least.
