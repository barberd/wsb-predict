{"id": "gpw140", "title": "Trade I'm taking on EUR/USD", "selftext": "I suggested this trade on another autist thread and thought i might as well put it here too. It literally cannot go tits up. Copy and pasted. \n\nYou could try this trade I'm about to take on my demo forex account. (i have a live account with $1000 dollars im just too pussy to start atm).\n\nIf you can get $250 you can open a live account on 'IG FX'.  You will be able to trade the EUR/USD pair at a max lot size of 0.10, meaning every time price moves .0001(pip) in value, your position gains or loses $1.00 in value. You will be able to have a stop loss of 200ish pips(risking $200). \n\nEUR/USD is going down this week for sure, at least to the tune of a hundred pips by the end of Wednesday. So you should be looking for selling opportunities.  Right now price is at 1.0903. Ideally you should enter the sale as close to the 1.0920 price level as possible, but it might not retrace back that high. Just make sure you take the sale before price drops below 1.0880. Which should happen before 8am ET on monday. When you enter the trade set your stop loss at the 1.1010 level. Now you just gotta hold until you're over $100 or start paying close attention when price is gets to 1.0800, which should be Wednesday afternoon the latest. \n\nYou could probably hold longer but, price is probbably gonna turn back around after hitting the 1.0800 level again. My plan was to get the 100pips and chill till another easy play shows up. The markets open in a few hours at 5PM ET. IG is super easy to sign up with and a toddler could learn how to trade using it. Good Luck. Ill post an edit to see if i was right or not.", "created_utc": 1590349586.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gpw140/trade_im_taking_on_eurusd/", "is_self": true}
