Here's the next big shit and I'll show you proper research ya shits.\n\nStep 1. Figure out your initials (Mine are PSA)\n\nStep 2. Look up the company. (Public Storage)\n\nStep 3. Figure out what the fuck they do. \n\n* These shits are REITs, meaning they make a fuck ton of money renting shit out and they pay a fuck ton of money to boomers.\n\nStep 4. Model that shit out.\n\n* Build one of those fancy things or be an autist and call up a researcher\n* Get valuation. Fair Value is 290.\n\nStep 5. Google Search trends. People rent this shit by searching for it. More searches = more interest. You think dumbass analyst gonna know next quarter EPS? Bitch, google gonna know.\n\nStep 6. Realize trends are up way fucking higher than these analysts think and their balance sheet is clean.\n\nStep 7. Realize Renaissance Technologies is invested and no matter what due diligence you do, they always fucking right. Plus they bought more (13F came out this morning). We about to be rich. The god of investing in titties bought more shares recently. My ass puts them knowing more about what's going on then my retarded brain does.\n\n![img](amv23rinsyg41 \"Google Trends - Public Storage searches\")\n\nThe competitors are fucking waste, you got Extra Space Storage that stores old titties, and CubeSmart who's cleverest shit was making their ticker \"CUBE\". Dumbshits. Also, Life Storage, which legit full of idiots, who the fuck gonna go to their friends and be like \"Ya I store my grandma's ashes at Life Storage.\" With over 162 million square feet of rentable self-storage space, PSA is larger than its next three largest competitors combined. This gives PSA more brand recognition, especially on the internet where an increasing amount of leads and traffic comes from for all self-storage companies. That's going to be a nice tendies maker.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr buy shares, buy LEAPS, go fucking long. We going up and up and away. \n\n# Jan 15/2021 - 280c. \n\nBuy me a storage centre when you make some tenders.", "created_utc": 1581719869, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f40497/massive_due_diligence_on_the_future_public/", "is_self": true}
