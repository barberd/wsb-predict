This included approximately 50,900 Model 3 and 12,100 Model S and X.\"\n\nthat's going to represent 5.0Bn in revenue for the quarter, assuming the sales mix stayed exactly the same (which we know it didn't since the models S and X delivered were reduced by almost half)\n\ni don't know what their Q1 revenue guidance was, but they are almost definitely going to miss and by a lot\n\nEdit: I'm probably going to do some new math tonight as I'm aware tesla gets revenue from non-vehicle sales.\"\n\nturns out i was estimating high and non-vehicle revenue was significantly lower than expected (down almost 20% YoY), resulting in net revenue of 4.5Bn\n\nbased on the same napkin math (unchanged margin) and adjusted to say that revenue from non-vehicle sales remained constant;\n\nrevenue should be in the 6.34Bn range for automotive and 300MM for non-auto for a total around 6.64Bn, given the speed of the shanghai build and the panasonic issues it wouldn't surprise me to see capital expenditures way up (again). there's also less ZEV available to them and i believe they've lowered the price of their cars to account for the loss of tax credits, that represents another potential haircut to revenue and margins\n\nTSLA doesn't do revenue guidance, just deliveries. earningswhisper has estimated revenue at 6.78Bn which i think is definitely going to miss, and EPS of (1.78) which is always a crapshoot since TSLA uses the shadiest accounting practices available, but hard to imagine it won't continue to be below expectations.\n\nDisclaimer: i currently have no position in TSLA. i will be looking to see if it can push over 245 before earnings and then i'll sell call credit spreads the week of.", "created_utc": 1562186752, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c8tei6/some_tesla_numbers/", "is_self": true}
