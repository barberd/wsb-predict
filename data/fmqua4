{"id": "fmqua4", "title": "MO - Altria Puts", "selftext": "Altria (MO) is a producer of cigarettes including ecigs.  Tobacco use  has been well known to cause lung cancer but now Covid19 has the potential to change all that - instead of slowly killing off their customers in decades it is killing them in days.  Nearly all of the critical care cases of younger people in their 20s and 30s have 1 common trait - they are smokers either directly or through exposure to 2nd hand smoke.\n\nWith that kind of brand damage cigarettes will be a long time coming around to popular use again.  Even doctors and other medical staff who hypocritically smoke while telling patients not to do so are not doing so in these times.  Images of Italian patients with plastic bell cases over their heads are scaring the crap out of smokers in a way that public lecturing isn't.\n\nThe bull argument is that the client base is literally addicts and during stressful times people will smoke more.  My response is that with reduced income people will cut back and spend their money on food and utilities instead.  Also in many areas cigarettes are more expensive b/c of govt taxes.\n\nEarlier I had said that Altria was not a bailout candidate\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flmv34/bailout\\_proof\\_companies\\_to\\_short/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flmv34/bailout_proof_companies_to_short/) but it is still a massive giant with billions in cash - yet the stock would fall for different reasons as outlined above.  Everyone is predicting that the quarantine in force will extend for months - not weeks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you are interested please see the boomer discussion on Yahoo Finance, [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MO/community?p=MO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MO/community?p=MO),  where they are dollar cost averaging (DCA) all the way down to the current price, greedy for the fat dividends, and STILL talking about stock buybacks.  Are they delusional?  Well, their dreams are my gain.  MO's earnings is scheduled for 4/30 (estimate - this is a moving target as the company is in a bit of confusion now) so do not buy options expiring before that.  They are expected to have large asset impairment write offs.  MO is not going to 0 however as they own about 10-15% of BUD (Annheuscher Busch) as an additional revenue stream.\n\nAlso -see sexy chart below.\n\nTLDR - June MO 30p.  No position yet but looking to re-assess entry this coming week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nifib5l1h4o41.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=caa9c541c8f756f7d9e23de8c8fa8dc65c329fe6", "created_utc": 1584838546.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmqua4/mo_altria_puts/", "is_self": true}
