I've come to the conclusion that making profit on the market requires you to straddle a very fine line between mental retardation and the average IQ of the typical frontpage reddit commentor. If you've browsed the front page you'll know there is a very small gap between the two. Go too far on either side of the spectrum and you'll lose money. Maintain balance and you'll maintain profits. \n\nTA is trash, DD is gay. Yesterday I read some guys DD on REV and how they were the worst thing ever. Even though I'm too stupid to understand what he was saying, I'm smart enough to understand how detailed it was. Balanced. As you can expect even after so much research the autist lost money. Coincedence? I think not. \n\nThe game is rigged boys, try to outsmart it and you'll get burned. \"but mUh The Big Short\", yea retard pretty sure that was fiction, just a fairy tale. I'm not even sure what that was about, but it was a hella good comedy. Consider this, maybe the retards who screeched about tesla 420 calls aren't so retarded, while the \"financial expert\" who wasted away the last 2 weeks staring at financial reports and graphs while simultaneously losing money daily is the retard. Quite ironic isn't it. \n\n\"Hur Dur star wars do bad, didney do bad\" is maybe all the DD you need. Some idiot who didn't even know what a call or put was profitted last week practically just buying options clicking on random shit. This fine line of literally drooling on yourself and spending more than 15 mins doing research is achievable, it just takes dedication. Do yourself a favor, bang your head against the wall for a couple hours and recalculate your strategy. Come Monday you'll be rolling in tendies.", "created_utc": 1576976307, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/edy5j5/toeing_the_line_of_mental_retardation/", "is_self": true}
