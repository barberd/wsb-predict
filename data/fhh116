{"id": "fhh116", "title": "DD: CACC Credit Acceptance Corp is a sleeper put", "selftext": "I've been searching for stocks that should be impacted by (a) the virus and (b) recession, but haven't been yet. CACC is a subprime auto financing corporation for consumer auto loans. The subprime auto loan sector is already unstable as fuck. Americans owe over $1.2 trillion in fucking auto loans, and over 5% are 3 months or more behind on their car payments. That's 7 million bad loans.  \n\n\nCACC has an F rating from SCHWAB, under perform from Credit Suisse, avoid from Market Edge, Underperform from Reuters, and a buy from CFRA. Their credit rating is Baa3, the lowest investment grade bond.   \n\n\nOn February 13, days before the crash, investment fraud law firm Zamansky LLC announced on businesswire that the wyould be investigating CACC for breach of fiduciary duty, claiming that \\*\\*\"the State of Mississippi has charged Credit Acceptance with being a \u201c\\[p\\]redatory subprime auto lender,\u201d seeking disgorgement and civil penalties for various unfair and deceptive practices. The Company has also seen a deterioration in credit quality, a rise in delinquencies, and a drop in the loan collection rate. \"\\*\\*  \n\n\nHowever, the stock price was unaffected.  \n\n\nOn Feb 20, they dropped 10% with the crash but rallied to an incredible 2% net return between the crash and yesterday March 10, and finally tanked in today's market by 8.5%.  \n\n\nTheir leading competitor Santander Consumer USA SC is down 24% since the crash. Santander has its own problems and is probably a good put as well, but I believe CACC is a major sleeper opportunity that will tank on open and drop like a rock.  \n\n\nDisclaimer - I don't know shit, I'm not a trader, and I just did all this research tonight. Also haven't slept for about 36 hours. If you know shit about the sector and can explain to me why a subprime auto lender has held up like a champ during this crash, please let me know before I buy puts   \n\n\ntl;dr this shit hasn't tanked yet but it deserves to 4/17 350p", "created_utc": 1584022739.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhh116/dd_cacc_credit_acceptance_corp_is_a_sleeper_put/", "is_self": true}
