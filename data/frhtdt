I hope you\u2019re having a safe weekend following the  recommendations to stay safe, like social distancing from your wife  while she\u2019s at her boyfriend\u2019s house.\n\nNeed to start with a special shoutout to users\u2019 tiny boomer and SV, nice DD post and thanks for joining [u/wallstreetbooyah](https://www.reddit.com/u/wallstreetbooyah/) stream. I was a little disappointed that I didn\u2019t see any man boobs on the stream though. \\*sigh zips-up\\*\n\nBut  anyway\u2026this isn\u2019t financial advice, but the somewhat coherent rambling  of a neckbeard who just ate 3 gummies while trying to explain the magic  crayons and to help you fucks make money vs losing it. Bear or bull, I  like the horns and claws nawmean - gotta spice up that bedroom life.  Also magic crayons are shit at predicting anything market related, but I  like the way they taste, specially the purple one.\n\nSo,  let\u2019s talk about SPY. First and foremost, this is unprecedented  territory in the US stock market meaning for you lazy fucks that don\u2019t  want to Google, we haven\u2019t really seen this type of activity in markets,  so your guess is as good as mine, always hedge just in case.\n\n**My Positions: April & May 200p, also missionary.**  For the positions, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to go that low, but the  exposure and FD should net a nice return, hence the OTM selections, if  we open lower tomorrow before premium chips a tooth on it\u2019s way out from  shoving it up the ol\u2019 bum.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wa063t45spp41.jpg?width=1095&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7a7f04b45e646e6cfa9de0af5082eab417bbc413\n\nLooking  at the 4hr chart on SPY, you can see that it tested the $260 level  multiple times this week and never sustained a breakout (That\u2019s the  green crayon). What I'm looking for now is one or two things, we're  going to break out of this level, our lows will be in, and we'll come  back and breakout of this trendline or we\u2019ll break this pattern and then  see a continuation downward.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mp7ozfr5spp41.jpg?width=730&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8a65caa38ce200c20e1a77902eff452a5392ab75\n\nBearish Levels to watch:\n\n**SPY $239** \u2013 We break support\n\n**SPY $228** \u2013 We break this support\n\n**SPY $218-219** \u2013 This is the key level, if support breaks, we will go lower to about $180ish, if not, all-in calls.\n\nTLDR:  SPY going to keep dropping for the short term, lowest level based on  magic crayons is $218-219, watch other levels $239/$228. Lots of volume  on 4/17 puts, MM\u2019s gonna cuck you so sell prior week.\n\nTLDR x2: Shotty DD at best.", "created_utc": 1585532355.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frhtdt/magic_crayons_from_a_neckbeard_on_gummies/", "is_self": true}
