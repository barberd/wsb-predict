DDeflation**\n\nYour boy, JPOW, is sending us into a deflationary period. You might think; \"Well shit, the man is pumping this market with money printed from nowhere. Why wouldn't this be inflation?\" Because Irving Fisher says so, that's why.\n\nLet's imagine a see-saw, on one side is your fat cousin who represents: an insanely overvalued market, liquidity problems, bad debt, the attempt to shrug off 3.3 million unemployed, a god damn global pandemic, the US leading said pandemic in number of cases despite testing like its some secret, and the easter bunny as the beacon for the end of the beer virus.\nOn the other end of the see-saw we have JPOW. This weakarmed baby is trying to level the see-saw by throwing his weight behind the lever arm: unlimited QE, rate cuts, some shit stimulus check, and the money printer. JPOW is able to maintain equilibrium and float your fat cousin on the other end of the see-saw.\n\nThen, all of a sudden, a blue chip company in the US Economy shits the bed. Bad debt, a plane that spontaneously combusts due to some moron coder who was hired off fiver, a bank who gave out money to fund your wife's boyfriend's Jet-Ski/DJ Studio goes under. This is your obese cousin putting on a lead jacket. JPOWs weak baby arms can't maintain equilibrium of the see-saw and the whole thing crashes down. Leaving your cousin crying in the sand with some needle from your awful park in his arm.\n\n**II. IrVing Fisher**\n\nIrving Fisher is much more eloquent in *The Debt-Deflation Theory of the Great Depression*[^1](https://phare.univ-paris1.fr/fileadmin/PHARE/Irving_Fisher_1933.pdf)-1933 and campares this to a ship floating in the ocean. The ship will tend to be in equilibrium, but once it begins to capsize it will only further depart from this equilibrium. He surmises that it is impossible to be in the Atlantic without seeing a wave.\n\nHe goes on to say that every recession has had and will have two main \"waves\"; Debt and Deflation.\n\n> \"in the great booms and depressions... two dominant factors, namely over-indebtedness to start with and deflation following soon after... Disturbances in these two factors\u2014debt and the purchasing power of the monetary unit\u2014will set up serious disturbances in all, or nearly all, other economic variables.\"\n\nLet's think about 2008 for a second, some kid is on the street with a RipStik listening to Jason Mraz. His dad bought some house with a variable interest rate they could hardly afford for 500k that is for some reason worth 1.2 mil 5 years later. The Dad takes a loan against that 700k in found money to fund his coke habit and eventually has to declare bankruptcy once the entire market blows up. Now, add a few zeros and make that house some insanely overvalued company that took out loans to buy back stock (which like the housing market is about to shit itself). That's the global economy of 2020.\n\nOur new friend, Irving, had something to say about this in 1933:\n> \"Easy money is the great cause of overborrowing. When an investor thinks he can make over 100 per cent per annum by borrowing at 6 per cent, he will be tempted to borrow, and to invest or speculate with borrowed money. This was a prime cause leading to the over-indebtedness of 1929.\"\n\n**III.\t Liquidation**\n\nHe goes further to describe the steps of a depression (we can be seen on Step 2).\n\n> \"Assuming, accordingly, that, at some point of time, a state of over-indebtedness exists, this will tend to lead to liquidation, through the alarm either of debtors or creditors or both....\n> \n> 1)\tDebt liquidation leads to distress selling and to\n> \n> 2)\tContraction of deposit currency, as bank loans are paid off, and to a slowing down of velocity of circulation. This contraction of deposits and of their velocity, precipitated by distress selling, causes\n> \n> 3)\tA fall in the level of prices, in other words, a swelling of the dollar. Assuming, as above stated, that this fall of prices is not interfered with by reflation or otherwise, there must be\n> \n> 4)\tA still greater fall in the net worths of business, precipitating bankruptcies and\n> \n> 5)\tA like fall in profits, which in a \"capitalistic,\" that is, a private-profit society, leads the concerns which are running at a loss to make\n> \n> 6)\tA reduction in output, in trade and in employment of labor. These losses, bankruptcies, and unemployment, lead to\n> \n> 7)\tPessimism and loss of confidence, which in turn lead to\n> \n> 8)\tHoarding and slowing down still more the velocity of circulation.\"\n\nFor the non readers of the group: companies that took out large loans for stock buybacks are fucked, unemployment and margin calls will lead to people liquidating assets furthering our drop.\n\nFisher had thoughts on liquidation and his boat. He believes liquidation aggravates debt, growing a depression instead of recovering from it.\n\n> \"They were great enough not only to \"rock the boat\" but to start it capsizing. By March, 1933, liquidation had reduced the debts about 20 percent, but had increased the dollar about 75 percent, so that the real debt, that is the debt as measured in terms of commodities, was increased about 40 percent [(100%-20%)X(100%+75%)=140%]. \"\n\n**IV. The Plays**\n\n**So what did we learn from Fisher?**\n\n1)\tDebt liquidation leads to panic selling\n\n2)\tPanic selling leads to a swelling dollar\n\n\n**If you have been active on the sub you may have noticed /u/Variation-Separate calling on 1929 and saying he is:**\n\n1)\tShort GLD, SPY, and IWM\n\n2)\tLong UUP\n\n**What are these plays really?**\n\n1)\tPanic selling will lead to a sharp drop and MMs being called on margin leading to liquidation. This forced liquidation will have MMs selling their best performing assets ie. Gold\n\n2)\tUUP tracks the price of the US dollar against other world currencies. If Fishers March 1933 numbers above hold true we should see large price action of UUP.\n\n\n**V. TL;DR**\n\n5/1 130p GLD\n\n6/19 30c UUP\n\n[1) Please Read Fishers Writeup.
