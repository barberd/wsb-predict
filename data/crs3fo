Today, we have risk of recession in multiple global economies:\n\n* **UK**: Consumer confidence is growing, however due to Brexit no-deal, the country is in a perfect position to significantly feel the effects of any global slowdown\n* **Japan**:  Officials have been saying that the country may have already been in a recession since Mar '19, things aren't looking pretty with the new Japan/Korea trade dispute\n* **Germany**: Low auto purchases are affecting the country, analysts said that low exports are slipping Germany into recession territory (although not yet there)\n* **Italy**: GDP growth has slowed to a projected .1% this year\n* **Singapore:** The business giant just had their second quarter of negative GDP growth, confirmed at -3.3% due to global trade slowdowns\n* **Argentina:** Their market just had the largest market crash since 1950, and are again at the brink of a recession, there is worry that the country will default on its debts\n* **Mexico:** High unemployment, investment has dropped, services sector is dropping\n* **Brazil:** Largest economy in Latin America, suffering from low manufacturing production, the country is releasing a report in the coming weeks which will determine whether or the not it is already in recession \n\nI'm not saying that a doomsday recession is coming, or anything of that sort. But I think it's naive to think that other major global economies' slowdowns won't affect the US economy in anyway.", "created_utc": 1566076654, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/crs3fo/governments_are_all_bull_penises/", "is_self": true}
