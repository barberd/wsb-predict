I see you runnin around every goddamn week at the slightest hint of a flesh wound. I\u2019ve denounced your ways, and have been riding the bull train to a 45% portfolio gain. \n\n*But something ain\u2019t right.* \nJust like you money hating cucks, I\u2019m getting a tingling feeling in my sphincter that\u2019s telling me the market is about to throw a tantrum. Something in the air is changing and this high pressure weather system we\u2019ve been in is about to get it\u2019s dick slapped harder than a trailer park in tornado alley. \n\nI\u2019m exiting my calls (even my fucking Jan 21\u2019s) between tomorrow and Friday next week, then loading up on cheap spy puts for September. \n\nI think you shitbirds might actually be on to something about that second leg down. It\u2019s getting too bullish and I can feel the MM\u2019s tugging on that rug, and testing retails\u2019 reactions before the guillotine. \n\nWe\u2019re gonna be reaching some more ATH\u2019s within these next couple of weeks and I\u2019ll probably miss out and leave some mean chunks of change on the table but I\u2019m not getting caught in this shit storm. \n\nIdk what the fuck is going to happen on the 14th or after but my gut gurgles even thinking about it. I hate the number 13 but that\u2019s probably gonna be the last Green Day we see for a minute. \n\nI love you fuckin retards and I know this post is gonna fall on blind eyes and deaf ears, but there\u2019s some serious fuckin voodoo shit going on. Make some goddamn munnies and invite me to your feast of tendies. \n\nAlso, if I get back to my initial gain of 18.5k on June 8th, I\u2019m getting a tattoo of the wsb logo. Currently 1/6 of the way there. \n\n**TL;DR** - ride your calls, swap em for cheap and/or close otm Aug/Sept dated spy puts before the 14th. Take profits you piggy fucks and don\u2019t get slaughtered. \n\nI\u2019m not a financial advisor and these claims are pure speculation and whodoovoodoo.*\n\nEdit: my likely position is going to be 10-25% of my buying power on 08/03 295p and manage it from there. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see Spy 325-330 beforehand, but I\u2019m definitely not banking on it.", "created_utc": 1593572970.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hj287h/guts_superstition_and_tinfoil_ramblings_of_a_wsb/", "is_self": true}
