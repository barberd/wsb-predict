I say \"no short ROKU\" like Trump says \"no collusion.\" After that MONSTER QUARTER, it's time for another round of PUMP IT PUMP IT PUMP IT UP.\n\n30 million accounts watching 3.5 hours of TV per day... this is like 210 million accounts with FB-level engagement. OK? BIG engagement. And growing. Owning the customer relationship to the TV, what could possibly be more valuable than this? Not even Facebook have this. Not even Google or Apple have something this powerful. (To be clear, this is a forward looking statement. I disclaim all obligations to update forward looking statements under the safe harbor provison yada yada yada)\n\nROKU demolishing competition in terms of devices sold and streaming viewing hours... oh, you thought Amazon Fire would crush ROKU? Smart thought, but now that this did not happen and will not happen(refer to ROKU shareholder letter, other sources showing increasingly growing lead, please talk to boomer suburban white ladies over cup of chamomile), perception of value should go way fucking up.\n\nBy the way management is just top notch... They have the interest of customer and content provider in mind, and strategic placement as well. Mr. Wood genuinely is a top-tier CEO.\n\n#International\n\nAnthony Wood was very coy on the call when asked about interntational. I love this coyness and it only makes me hard. ROKU has big plans for international, it is a vast opportunity. Refer to NFLX stock performance since entering the international market. There is no reason why ROKU will not own this market too.\n\n\n#Virtuous cycles/Network effects\n\nSo, so many. It's beautiful. \n\nROKU channel -- Moar engagement -&gt; Moar ad revenue -&gt; Moar content providers place content on service -&gt; Moar engagement\n\n(this also exist for individual channels ecosystem on ROKU)\n\nSimple right? Here's another\n\nROKU OS builds brand &amp; customer demand -&gt; OEM want to partner with ROKU -&gt;  Moar make and models available for TV -&gt; Moar customer adoption &amp; brand -&gt; Moar OEM\n\nYeah you like that you little bitch? Here is another network effect:\n\nMoar users -&gt; More money -&gt; Make better OS -&gt;Moar users\n\nOh yeah did I mention the explosive fucking growth across active accounts and ARPU? I guess take a note of that.\n\nLook guys, this stock is at its most undervalued so far. While it is at highest price so far, the biggest barrier to a $1,000 stock price, fears of competition, should be essentially removed at this point. It is now cheaper relative to its total possible exponential growth, than it has ever been.", "created_utc": 1565286796, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cnpbd3/why_roku_is_a_1000_stock/", "is_self": true}
