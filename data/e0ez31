No, you don't.\n\nOK, so lulu operates \\~300 stores in the us and Canada, most of them have less than 3000 sqft of sales floor. They had &gt; 3B in revenue in 2018, making it the highest sales per square foot of any apparel retailer.\n\nThey have had continuous year over year growth.\n\nThey have a huge market interest in China, that they haven't started to capitalize on.\n\nLULU is expanding to other areas of Becky's life, such as: jackets, hats, water bottles and other stuff that complements their core products. Even men's apparel, which could be profitable.\n\nI queued up 10 put credit spreads exp 11/29 selling put at 220 and buying 217.5 gross credit of about 1,000 for monday morning. \n\nWhat do you think? If I find adequate evidence that this is retarted, I will cancel.", "created_utc": 1574495961, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e0ez31/bullish_lulu_dd_sell_puts_or_buy_calls/", "is_self": true}
