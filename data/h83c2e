{"id": "h83c2e", "title": "How legit is this strategy? Calendar spreads before earnings reports", "selftext": "Recently I've been opening calendar spreads right before earnings reports and have had a lot of success. So far I've made plays on 5 different companies and won on 4 (NVDA, COST, ZM, ADBE), averaging a 54% profit per trade, and lost 68% on WORK due to that 20% drop. So overall profit per trade has been 24%.\n\nSo far I've been opening call calendar spreads (more volume than puts) about a week in advance with a short call that expires the same week as the ER for maximum gains from theta and IV crush after ER, and long call either 1-2 weeks farther out, and with strikes slightly bullish or bearish depending on overall market trend and sentiment for ER. I'll typically hold until 1-2 days before ER or sooner if the stock quickly pushes past my strike. Either way I'll re-open spreads with a new strike that reflects the new environment.\n\nThe maximum potential gains have come from the morning after ER, when IV crush and theta tend to drop the value of the short far more than that of the long. I've been able to profit even when the stock is 5% off of my chosen strike (and typically at open there is almost always a volatile swing back towards my strike in the event that it starts farther off). The only trade where I've lost is WORK due to a huge 20% swing which seems relatively uncommon. As long as I keep positions small, I can't get my portfolio wiped out.\n\nMy question is, does anybody else have experience with this strategy or similar strats? The profit potential is much much higher than an iron condor and typically has a wider profitable range. Is their a way to improve my strategy or am I missing something? Because right now it just seems like really easy money.", "created_utc": 1592035510.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h83c2e/how_legit_is_this_strategy_calendar_spreads/", "is_self": true}
