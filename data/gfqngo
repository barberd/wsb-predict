{"id": "gfqngo", "title": "Long Guts", "selftext": " The markets right now currently operate on the principle of What The Fuck. Good DD is useless because apparently current stock prices are now centered on possible profitability in about 2023 or what the fuck ever. The only ways I have made or lost money lately can be broken into three equal categories:\n\nWhen I went with solid DD\n\nWhen I inversed solid DD \n\nWhen I used spreads\\*.   \n\\*To be fair, I mostly make money on spreads, but I\u2019m very annoyed at having to use safe tactics and common sense when I should be making a killing off the economic demise of the United States of America. Just puts sand in my jock. Anyway, we all know what vertical spreads are, but there are less boring ways to not lose money.\n\nI'm using a tactic that makes sure I lose on 50% of options I buy *on purpose*. \n\nI've seen this called 'long guts' which is dumb as dog shit, but whatever. \n\nBuy ITM put & call equidistant from the money (i.e. strike $2 +/-) . Per my usual, expiry a 3 - 6 weeks out. So if we do this with SPY it would go like (based on yesterday\u2019s close, rounded up): \n\nBuy put 6/1 @ 290 = $9.68 / contract\n\nBuy call 6/1 @ 286 = $9.30 / contract\n\nI generally target a week worth of hold time on these plays. So, by 5/15 I\u2019m looking for SPY roughly above $297 or below $276 to put me in the money. So 20 calls, 20 puts: $38k entry. If SPY hits $300 anytime between Monday and 5/15, I close out up between $5000 and $2400. If it goes to $305 that puts me between $15k to 10k. If everything is flat as fuck for some reason, I can ditch for less than $5k and pick a different pony.\n\nSo, if I had done this last week it would have looked like this:  \n5/1 (285, because my luck is like that) - buy 283c + 287p  \n5/8 - sell position @ 291  \nOutcome: lose 3k\n\nHow about the week before:  \n4/24 (280) - buy 278c + 282p  \n4/29 : sell @ 294  \nOutcome: make 7500\n\nBuying a month out of expiration gives you enough time to wait for market gyrations. However, the longer the wait, the bigger the move you need to cash in. You can always buy deeper in the money (strikes further apart) to make it easier to win, but why would a WSBer do that?  \n[http://opcalc.com/7xC](http://opcalc.com/7xC)\n\nI may go away from SPY for this, to energy, retail, REITs, or credit cards & check cashers for this - seeking volatility. This trade strategy is perfect for WSB because it encourages rapid trading, but also bagholding until you\u2019re fucking broke. Give it a shot. You\u2019re just going to lose all your money in this retarded market anyway.", "created_utc": 1588933392.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gfqngo/long_guts/", "is_self": true}
