So what are people going to do other than jerk off and play solitaire?? I\u2019m betting on video games. Sony has 95mm PS4\u2019s our WW and takes 15-30% on anything sold through the PlayStation store. Nintendo has 50mm Switch\u2019s sold and takes a similar cut. From some quick research it seems like digital sales make up ~25% of Sony\u2019s revenue and ~10% of Nintendo\u2019s which is fairly substantial for both, yet they\u2019re down 15% and 5% T1M respectively. \n\nAnyone that knows more about video games got thoughts on whether they\u2019re primed for a bump due to the beer virus?", "created_utc": 1583517248, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/feh8t1/thoughts_on_sony_and_nintendo/", "is_self": true}
