It isn't going to happen. At least, not for another 8 months at minimum.\n\nYou see, Donald Trump has engineered the perfect plan to keep the stock market fake until at least the presidential election. \n\nMarch 11 - The Donald meets with Wall Street CEO's. The SPY is at $273, and on a rapid decline. I don't have the exact transcript of what happened during this meeting; however, I assume it went a lot like this. \n\nDT - \"Mr. CEO's. I have the most beautiful economic opportunity for you guys. Our economy is on a path downwards, but luckily for you guys, I have located JPOW's G-Spot. Let the SPY drop to $220.\" \n\nDo you guys remember the Shadow War post a while back? The one where that one dude noticed that our markets were being under attack? Keep reading to learn more. \n\nYou see Mr. Pow likes getting fucked in the ass, but that is besides the point. Seems like the Donald gave him a good fucking, and BAM! 0 percent interest rates on March 14. Wall Street (THE PEOPLE ATTACKING THE MARKET) is now able to buy at a nice SPY price of $220, with a practically infinite amount of borrowed money. \n\nThe FED printing money is just a ploy to keep the news \"good.\" If stocks go up on bad news, there is some Chinese shit going on. However, we, the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA can't have that. Insert stimulus, insert FED printing, insert largest bull run since that one year everyone keeps mentioning. Insert Trump firing the Inspector General, so HE can oversee all 2 Trillion dollars of stimulus spending. \n\nI honestly believe Trump and Wall Street CEO's should be investigated by the SEC. Everything just points to market manipulation, and it all starts with him. \n\nWall Street is having an orgy with stimulus money in the markets. Prices will be kept artificially high for the foreseeable future. Bears and Bulls are both fuc. \n\nAnyways\n\nTLDR: The SPY is flat for the next 8 months, and then buy puts.\n\nEdit: I said Bull Market in the title.
