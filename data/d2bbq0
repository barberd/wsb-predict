I've discovered a bug in the Robinhood web client (and possibly  mobile)  that makes open option contract positions inaccessible from  your  account.\n\nThis bug involves  the  'History' queue used to cancel existing orders. Normally, after a  set  number of orders in a certain position are entered, the oldest  entries  in this history queue are removed to free up space. This is set  behavior  and completely normal.\n\nHOWEVER,   if the user sets a 'Good until canceled' order, and this open order  goes  unfilled while other orders in the same position continue to be  placed,  this open order will eventually disappear from the queue \u2026  along with  any ability to alter or cancel it.\n\nProof:\n\n[https://i.postimg.cc/nzZFXqPY/Proof1.png](https://i.postimg.cc/nzZFXqPY/Proof1.png)\n\n[https://i.postimg.cc/W4mjch1D/Proof2.png](https://i.postimg.cc/W4mjch1D/Proof2.png)\n\n[https://i.postimg.cc/8z5ZLCY2/Proof3.png](https://i.postimg.cc/8z5ZLCY2/Proof3.png)\n\nI   currently own 100 Teva 9/20 calls entered with a sell limit of 0.05   that I am unable to access or sell for a lower price because the order   has vanished from my queue. Yes, I have checked the details of every   single order in that queue.\n\n\\-\n\nEssentially,   this means that you are unable to cancel or alter ANY of the orders   affected by this bug. They are 'locked in' and inaccessible from your   account, and will only execute if the original limit price entered is  reached.\n\nThis is a MASSIVE issue  and completely unacknowledged by Robinhood at this time. The client can  quite literally hold your positions hostage, and there's absolutely   nothing you can do about it.\n\nTL;DR:   To avoid this issue, NEVER use 'Good until canceled' orders on   Robinhood. If one of these stays unfilled and gets cleared from the   history queue, you're out of luck unless it fills.", "created_utc": 1568137675, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d2bbq0/critical_flaw_in_robinhood_order_queue/", "is_self": true}
