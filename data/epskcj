{"id": "epskcj", "title": "1/31 AMD Call", "selftext": "Hello fellow financial retards,\n\nI would like to know what you guys think of a 1/31 52.5 AMD call which is currently $152. I thought since the upward trend they have had recently would lead to it getting even higher. Also their earnings report gets released on 1/28. What do you guys think? Should I wait to see if it drops in the morning on market open and see if I can get a lower price or just go ahead and put in a buy order? Or is this plan retarded and I shouldn't do it at all?", "created_utc": 1579221507, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/epskcj/131_amd_call/", "is_self": true}
