I find the moderate scenario to be worthy of investment and even the conservative estimates justify WORK's current market cap. The risk/reward profile of these three scenarios makes me bullish on the company. However, the valuation process also reminds me why I am not confident investing in high-growth companies; you need to make a lot of estimates and small differences between your estimates and reality will result in wildly different outcomes. I would never short a company like WORK for the same reason; there are realistic scenarios in which the company compounds shareholder value for a decade or more.\n\nThe major value I see in having a quantitative model is that it helps translate disagreements on qualitative factors into raw numbers. If you think Slack is far superior to Teams, you can use a high market share estimate. If you think WORK's top-line growth will slow dramatically as they get larger, use a lower estimate for CAGR of revenue. I acknowledge there are an endless number of permutations of model inputs, so I invite readers to share their estimates and valuations in the comments section. \n\nLastly the COVID Culture will play out nicely with the WFH workforce, where slack clearly has the definitive lead. And with the recent Amazon partnership, things are looking bright.\n\n\nPositions  $34c 6/26,  $36 c- 7/17", "created_utc": 1592100402.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h8l23f/everybodys_work_ing_for_the_weekend/", "is_self": true}
