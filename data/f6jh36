Yes, you can't predict the future, and you never know it's \"early\" until hindsight... But, no. It was early. His contract expired two weeks out, and it was a weekly. So he sold it the same day he bought it. I asked why, and he said because he's a \"safe investor.\" He said *if I see an 80% profit, I'm more than happy to sell.* I thought about that... And then it hit me. I know what his deal was. I can guarantee that son of a bitch put in like 500k and rather than sweat it out waiting for it to keep going up, with **all that risk,** why not just cash out with 80% on 500k... And then repeat the next day. Bitch, you ain't smart.
