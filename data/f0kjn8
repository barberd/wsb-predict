{"id": "f0kjn8", "title": "Short Guide to Stock Ratios", "selftext": "Basic fundamental analysis is absolutely necessary for determining the fair value of a stock and whether it would be a wise investment. This is a very simple composite of my favorite financial ratios and my preferred values for them. \n\n**LIQUIDITY**\n\n* Current Ratio\n   * This is the most useful ratio for determining a company's short term financial health. A value at or over 1 indicates that the company has the capital available to meet its short term obligations. Generally aim for a value of 1.50 or greater.\n* Quick Ratio\n   * This measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. Generally aim for a value of 1.00 or greater.\n* Total Debt to Current Assets\n   * This measures a company's ability to meet all its obligations with its current assets. Generally aim for a value of 1.1 or greater.\n\n**SOLVENCY**\n\n* Long Term Debt to Total Assets\n   * This measures the percent of a companies total assets it would need to liquidate to pay off its long-term debt. It's an excellent measure of long term financial health. Values of 0.4 or lower are ideal.\n* Long term Debt to Equity\n   * The value represents the ratio of capital financing derived from debt to that derived from shareholder equity. Examining this in conjunction with the previous ratio provides good picture of a company's long term financial health. Values of 2.0 or lower are best.\n* Times Interest Earned\n   * This measures the ability of a company to meet its debt payments. The higher the value the better, and anything at or over 1 indicates a company can meet its interest payments.\n\n**PROFITABILITY**\n\n**All profitability metrics should be compared to a peer group and or industry average.**\n\n* Net Margin\n   * This measures a company's post-tax profitability.\n* Return on Assets\n   * This measures how efficiently a company can use its assets to generate profit. Higher values are better.\n* Return on Equity\n   * This measures how efficiently shareholder's equity is used to generate returns. The higher the better.\n* Return on Invested Capital\n   * This measures the ability of a company to use shareholder's funds to generate earnings. I would argue that this is one of the most important drivers of valuation.\n* Positive EPS Growth\n   * Find companies with positive EPS growth and generally avoid companies with earnings deficits in the last five years.\n\n**VALUATION**\n\n**All valuation metrics should be compared to a peer group and or industry average.**\n\n* Price To Free Cash Flow\n   * Self explanatory. This is a personal favorite because free cash flow is very difficult to manipulate because it is based on cash accounting, unlike ratios like P/E which is based on accrual accounting.\n* EV to EBITDA\n   * Compares a company's cash flow to its economic value instead of its market value. More difficult to manipulate and provides a fuller picture than ratios such as P/E.\n* Price to Book Value\n   * This works best when valuing banks and capital-intensive companies because their assets are the core driver of their earnings.\n* Price to Earnings\n   * Fairly self explanatory. Despite my prior criticisms you should still include this in your analysis to help get the full picture.\n\n**ACTIVE RATIOS**\n\nThese are often overlooked as they aren't terribly important but they are useful for measuring the operational efficiency of a company.\n\n**All active ratios should be compared to a peer group and or industry average.**\n\n* Inventory Turnover\n   * This measures the speed at which a company can sell inventory and it works best with retailers. Low turnover ratios may imply weak sales or surplus inventory, while higher ratios indicate strong sales or lacking inventory.\n* Accounts Receivables Turnover\n   * The higher this ratio the more efficient a company is at collecting receivables owed by customers.\n* Total Assets Turnover Ratio\n   * This measures how proficient a company is at using its assets to make a sale.", "created_utc": 1581125735, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f0kjn8/short_guide_to_stock_ratios/", "is_self": true}
