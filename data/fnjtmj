I'm afraid this question never ends with you making money.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe whole world right now is currently focused at how to make money in the stock markets, half of it divided in the \"this isn't really bad\", and the other half thinking this is going to be a bigger recession than 2008. What if it actually is though, what if instead of a recession we are talking a depression? Here is what you can expect.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/euvoaz1p7fo41.png?width=613&format=png&auto=webp&s=db88c7abf9539d289618a573840985e3a3e92689\n\nThe first real signature of the depression was large economic slow down and massive loss of jobs. People were going jobless across a lot of countries due to the inability of the economy to sustain those jobs as people did not have money to spend on goods.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8z382rs48fo41.png?width=841&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b58acde7f5e28518b457a3a6d5ee8af376d4570\n\n*As the fed is currently feeding billions and trillions into the companies, in order to keep them afloat, in the from of loans at low/no or negative interest rates, the question is always the same:* ***Who will pay for these loans?*** \n\nAnd that is the main problem, as people lose jobs and loans are being printed out, we are not addressing how the loans will be repaid. The strength of the US economy was always that there was a lot of room to increase taxation, thus it was not a problem for the government to be piling debt more than you slam Budweiser on your Friday afternoon. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6h9ul2hz9fo41.png?width=628&format=png&auto=webp&s=cadcb0aaca5e41f6b47ee53b87c442c23dd49bf8\n\nNow as the economy is coming to an halt and all the companies are levied to their tits, the Fed plan on increasing that debt and loan more money to anyone who requests it, they will buyback stocks, ETFs eventually and whatever they can to maintain stock prices somewhat sustainable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Fed only has one lens, and that lens is the stock market, they are losing focus on the macro-economy aspect of it and how this will actually impact the USA position within the market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe only good news for the USA right now is that the world currently relies on the USD, so I guess it isn't just the USA's problem, but everyone's problem. The V shaped economy Trump was talking about is more and more looking like a slash shaped economy \\\\.\n\nI don't come to you with an answer but I will tell you this. Be very careful out there, do your best to help other people around you, and keep trying to make tendies you autistic fucks. Pay alot of attention to market movements, people will be divesting from US indexes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; SPY PUT 160 4/17\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\\[1\\]  Jerome Blum, Rondo Cameron, Thomas G.
