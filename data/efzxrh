{"id": "efzxrh", "title": "TSLA's future on realistic terms: what are your opinions?", "selftext": "On TSLA's side we have a rapidly rising demand for electric vehicles, with most governments even providing bonuses to buy 'em. The real assets of TSLA for me are brand, know how with autonomous driving and their charging infrastructure. But they also have huge problems coming their way. Big automotive groups have been autistic with EVs up until now, but they are picking up the pace fast and have years of R&amp;D stacked and ready to go. They are able to make some sick economies of scale (and because of that their profits margin are much higher than TSLA), have a huge  distribution network and most importantly they know how to build cars that are actually well made. HELL, look at the autonomotive industry, it's fusion after dicking fusion! \nIf I were in charge at TSLA I would think that the smartest choice would be to be bought by a major group, to benefit from infrastructures and synergies and all that, and maximizing shareholder values and facilitate growth. \nObviously Elon and is fucking God complex will never allow this, so in my vision the company will still have a hard time establishing herself as a major player. \nHaving said all of this I personally think that TSLA will remain strongly volatile but it's nowhere near the top of it's potential, so still lots of room to grow. But it surely will remain a stock for speculation rather than investment for the foreseeable future.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?", "created_utc": 1577389529, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/efzxrh/tslas_future_on_realistic_terms_what_are_your/", "is_self": true}
