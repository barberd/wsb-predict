I have a small portfolio, and yolo'd on these calls, but they have returned greatly (4k$+ Today). This case should move through the courts on a fast pace, seeing as lives are on the line. Gilead has a strong team and motivation to get this through and start treatment ASAP. \n\nI said it first, you called it second.
