That was the massive GUH of all the retarded 30 year old plebs who bought into the market mid april just because some idiot YouTube investing guru told them to buy the dip. The PPT kept buying futures to jack them up, as they succumbed to FOMO, and you could smell the flavour of bull cum from Mars, where Elon his probably smoking a joint on his Cybertruck, while tweeting about TSLA, another bubble in this stupid-ass market. Turns out this rally is officially over, as JPow printed more money tonight to pump the market 2% only for it to go down at market open. The momentum is gone. Your calls and stonks will be worthless pretty soon, as we'll see the biggest fucking deleveraging in human history since 1929. You really think that this levels of PE and debt can hold up forever? Get fucked by reality.  Even Buffet has become gay. 2020 is the year of the bear. Just buy cheap OTM puts while you still can. Or some bullshit strangles if you are a smart, I guess ... and  a virgin.\n\nTLDR SPY to 180 before October", "created_utc": 1591975504.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h7mpqn/turns_out_depression_isnt_cancelled/", "is_self": true}
