Although it's not 100% confirmed, I can see this becoming bigger news as we get closer to Christmas which I can see a quick pop on LMT the upcoming weeks. I've been eyeing on the 1/3/2020 390 Call that is priced around $1.1. LMT is dipping today and I think this will be a good opportunity to go in. I'll be looking to make my entry around today or at least by tomorrow\\~", "created_utc": 1576686949, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ecexpv/dec_25_supreme_leaders_great_gift/", "is_self": true}
