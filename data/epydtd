Google Finance function in Google Sheets says current shares are 13M. The S-1 says \\~1M shares. The two 10-Qs say 44-55M shares, but 72M in Q3 2019. Do you know how many FDSs there were for RVLV for these years? I'm also confused by the fact that they spent about $40M repurchasing shares but the share count has gone up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2019 Q2 10-Q:  [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1746618/000156459019031492/rvlv-10q\\_20190630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1746618/000156459019031492/rvlv-10q_20190630.htm) \n\n2019 Q3 10-Q:  [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1746618/000156459019041878/rvlv-10q\\_20190930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1746618/000156459019041878/rvlv-10q_20190930.htm) \n\nS1:  [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1746618/000156459018023704/ck0001746618-s1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1746618/000156459018023704/ck0001746618-s1.htm)", "created_utc": 1579254769, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/epydtd/what_are_the_average_fully_diluted_shares_for/", "is_self": true}
