{"id": "gvo9xe", "title": "OPTIONS HELP - IMP VOL", "selftext": " Hey guys,\n\nI need your help!\n\nWithin the think or swim platform, I added extra columns for Implied Volatility and IV Percentile within my watchlist. I wanted to ask what the fundamental difference was between the Imp Vol that is mentioned in my watchlist compared to the Implied Volatilities located on the options chain. (the ones showing different Imp Volitilities for different expiration dates)\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but I know that Imp Vol is the expected price movement of a stock annualized over one year or 365 days.. or should I use 252 trading days?!\n\nLastly, If I'm looking to pick options strategies based on Imp Vol (sell with high IV, and buy low IV), should I be determining strategies based on the IV Percentile in my watchlist?\n\nFor example, say SPY on my watchlist is showing an Imp Vol of 20%, but has a IV Percentile of 75%..should I be lookin at the IV Percentile value and sell options (sell straddles, iron butterflies, etc.) or buy that option?\n\nThanks so much guys. I've had some few questions before and everyone on here is super supportive and informative.
