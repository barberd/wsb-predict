And I was goddam shocked - pretty much lost my shit and still can't find it - to find out just how far up JPowells ass some of your heads are. So I decided to put my head in the bears mouth once again, because my big balls can't let me do other wise. I'm going full Mister Rogers on your undeserving asses.\n\nHere's a primer on dreaming. Makes me sad that the concept eludes you :\n\nWhen you dream, you imagine yourself being able to do anyting : you out-invest Warren Buffet from your couch , and he drives to your city to get tips from you ; J Powell rings you up to gift you his favorite printer, etc.\n\nDream big, Yo, it's the only way to YOLO\n\nEdit : Link to OrG post : https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/he49xh/if_you_knew_your_next_yolo_move_would_pan_out/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share", "created_utc": 1592912922.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hed5zw/jpow_visited_me_in_my_dreams_last_night/", "is_self": true}
