{"id": "gf1exl", "title": "Omega vs. Lambda", "selftext": "Out of curiosity for how one may determine an option \"expensive\" compared to another (e.g., AAL 60dte options vs. DIS 60dte options), I wondered if we could do so by comparing their potential returns. \n\nI had a feeling the main factors would involve delta (and gamma), current underlying stock price, and the option price. After some googling, I came across the variables omega and lambda. \n\n---\n\n**My questions:**\n\n1. Is there a difference between omega and lambda? What about gearing?\n2. How would you go about seeing how much of an impact the option's current IV would play on its omega/lambda value? (Knowing this could help you decide whether or not to purchase an option after IV crush, etc.)\n3. Will knowing the omega or lambda even be helpful for comparing options and determining how \"expensive\" it is?\n\n---\nI appreciate both autism and insight equally, please give.", "created_utc": 1588833473.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gf1exl/omega_vs_lambda/", "is_self": true}
