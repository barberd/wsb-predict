I'm going to do it by way of buying puts so my potential loss is limited. Plan on getting Aug 16th puts that are way out of the money, maybe $90-95 strike. I'm not YOLOing this (sorry). But I'll put a few thousand towards it. Maybe some next week, then the next, and once more, then wait. Not sure when lockup is up but I think sometime on Aug, maybe Aug 2nd. There should be selling around there, but could come a lot sooner too.", "created_utc": 1559949161, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/by17gq/going_to_short_bynd/", "is_self": true}
