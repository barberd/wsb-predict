{"id": "g3wqk9", "title": "SPY Volume Discussion", "selftext": "First and foremost I am an average investor. Nothing fancy, and around half a year of options experience and I am also very bearish. Technical analysis obviously has some truth to it, it's a tool to allow more accurate decision making but is not an oracle which is why I wanted to question one of the points that continuously get brought up - **volume**. Before the black swan event SPY traded at 50million average, now it's at around 130 million average. Given that there hasn't been extreme bearish news lately, wouldn't it be normal for SPY to be trading at a lower volume? The way I see it SPY shouldn't have increased volume unless there is a reason to, for example - a large GDP decrease, unexpected terrible earnings, a major country going under a 2nd lockdown, mass bankruptcy or extending lockdowns even further. I do believe DOW will decrease in the future but unless a major event happens, I don't see why SPY would gap down a lot within 2-6 weeks since there is also a good chance none of those examples will happen in that timeframe. Insight would be much appreciated.  \n\n\nIWM 7/17 100P, SPY300 5/15", "created_utc": 1587250129.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g3wqk9/spy_volume_discussion/", "is_self": true}
