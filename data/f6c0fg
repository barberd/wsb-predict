{"id": "f6c0fg", "title": "PSA: SPCE warrants are literally free money", "selftext": "\"What's a warrant?\"  I hear you asking. Let me put it in a language you may be familiar with. Warrants are like call options, issued by the company and generally long-dated and OTM when they are issued. In the case of SPCE warrants, they were issued a while back, and are basically a call option expiring in 2024 with a $11.50 strike price.\n\nThe intrinsic value of these warrants is always share price - $11.50, which is current about $33.50 - $11.50 = $22\n\nThey are trading for only $20 though!! You can literally buy the warrants and call your broker to exercise them for a **risk-free gain**. \n\nThe only catch here is that exercising a warrant takes 1-2 weeks, so in order to actually lock in risk-free profit you would need to enter into a short position, either by selling short or by getting some put options. Either way, you'd be paying a % borrow rate to short, or some time premium on the options. The borrow rate looks cheaper than these crazy premiums now. So if you buy a warrant, exercise it immediately, and simultaneously enter a short position, you'd clock $2 in gains per share over the duration of the trade, tying up about $60 in capital over 2 weeks, for a measly (BUT FREE) \\~3% over 2 weeks. Not bad if you don't fuck it up.\n\nIMHO, this is what's causing most of the crazy price movement - an artificially inflated short position due to some arbitrage fuckers trying to squeeze free money out of people like me and other autists on this sub, and this short position is causing a short squeeze in light of all the attention SPCE is getting.\n\nI haven't been doing this arbitrage shit though, I've just been piling on these warrants with whatever liquidity I have available in my Roth IRA. I'd rather get paid $2 to get a leveraged position with unlimited upside than cuck my gains at 3%. To the fucking moon!\n\nThese warrants are somewhat tricky to find, but the company only issues one official warrant at a time, they may be issued under SPCE.WS, SPCE.WT, or SPCE+ depending on your broker.", "created_utc": 1582125167, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6c0fg/psa_spce_warrants_are_literally_free_money/", "is_self": true}
