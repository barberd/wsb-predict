{"id": "et24d7", "title": "Church of WSB", "selftext": "\\*First post got deleted cuz of flair, im new to posting here but comment often my bad mods im rtarded\\*\n\nAccording to wikiHow, in order for a belief system to be recognized as a religion to uncle Sam all of the following must be met.\n\n* It has a creed and worship practices\n* It has formal leadership\n* It has a clear history\n* Its membership is distinct from other religious groups\n* There is a recognized course of study to ordain leaders in the religion\n* The religion has some form of foundational texts or literary tradition\n* There are recognized or regular places to worship\n* The religion has a regular congregation and services\n\nSo basically all of you autists need to come together and make some sacred tard texts, write down the history of WSB as far back as anyone can remember (even b4 the great Guh), and we all need to worship God online at least once a week (probably just commenting cringe stuff on a WSB podcast if a good one is made) so that the devil (IRS) doesn't steal our soul (tendies) for having the church own our property as well as our contributions that happen right before tax season.\n\nComing up with a way to appoint leaders is obvious. Personal risk tolerance needs to be at least 3x your annual income (if you have one that is) or you need to lead us to the tendie land like papa Musk and baby Su have. Aside from that we will have normal volunteers that will help keep the peace among the members. These volunteers will be called, \"Mods\" and obviously they have to be pretttyyyy gay to get that rank.\n\nIf anyone else is as interested in starting a religion as I am, please DM for a collab on the holy texts.\n\nps: fuck the IRS", "created_utc": 1579824887, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/et24d7/church_of_wsb/", "is_self": true}
