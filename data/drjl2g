{"id": "drjl2g", "title": "DD: How the rich got richer", "selftext": "So here's what happened:\n\n(a) The GOP wrote the most sickeningly sweet tax bill, which rewarded\nvoters for voting [R] by giving out bigger refunds, at least until\n2024 then those refunds for worker bees will get small again\n\n(b) but corporations were handed so many tax breaks that\n\n(c) now their pockets were full of extra Monopoly Money, and\n\n(d) that money could be used for Stock Buybacks, which slowly and surely\nboosts the price of the outstanding retail shares of stock\n\nSo the S&amp;P **rose from 2000 to 3000 in no time.** Egads! Thank you Paul Ryan!\n\nBUT:\n\n\n(e) Every Joe on the street now sees that he can take Cash Advance\nmoney from his credit card and owe only 19 percent on it, put that\nmoney into the Stock Market and earn freaking 50 percent!  That's\nRISK-FREE MONEY!\n\n(f) Joe on the Street starts taking these huge risks with his home\nequity and credit lines.\n\nThe Powers that Be, the Real Illuminati, the people who own the Banks,\ngot really worried about this.  Whatever will we do to slow all those\nstupid little people down?!? We can't push credit card debt rates\nbeyond the usurious 23.9 percent, no, legally, we can't! We have to do\nsomething!!\n\n(g) Since we already did the Tax part, let's do something else, let's\ndo TARIFFS! That way we can also beat down that annoying trade deficit\n--- we buy 200 trillion worth of stuff from China but China only buys\n400 billion worth of stuff from us! It's not right!\n\n(h) A tariff, then! Everything from China now comes with a 10 percent\ntariff! That will slow down all this China spending, while at the same\ntime bringing us a 10 percent return!\n\n(i) Who pays the ten percent? Why, the American consumer, of course!\nBut they won't like that, so let's just tell them that CHINA pays for\nit! They'll buy it up without thinking it through!\n\n**AND SO:**\n\nThey started a fire with Taxes, tried to put it out with Tariffs, and\nit's been working so well since the Stock Market is just the same\nright now as it was 20 months ago.  Every time they need the markets\nto \"COOL IT\" they tell Trump to send out another Tariff tweet.   He\nsays it's \"not his Trade War\".
