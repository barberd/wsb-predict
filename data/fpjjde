MORE PUTS", "selftext": "**~~MY FRIENDS~~** .... *AUTISTS** \n\n***TL:DR at the bottom!***\n\n*Warning: I skipped 3rd grade so I may have missed an important math lesson or two.* \n\nOkay guys so I'll get right to the point.. In case you just left your survival bunker. Recently, J Pow turned on his printing press! The Fed announced unlimited QE, mass Repo, etc. if you don't know what that stuff is you should **100%** be part of this forum so welcome. I just spent the last hour comparing and averaging the amount of securities held by the Feds since 2/19/20 (When the epidemic got real in the US) and the results are... Wild. I'll put up each week prior to the following, average 3 of the mild ones and then show you what happened when J Pow &amp;amp;amp;amp; Co. got jiggy with it. \n\n\n\nFirst off: Here is the website I got **all** my numbers from. After that I used my wife's boyfriends' calculator and my shrinking brain. \n\n[https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/)\n\n                       All Numbers are in Millions\n\n     2/19/20 - 3,839,819\n\n\n\nBeginning of \"The Beer\" USA laughs and says \"Get fucked it won't hurt us.\" \n\n   https://imgur.com/gallery/JcpdpZH\n\n     2/27 - 3,848,250 **(2/19-2/27 +8,431 Securities)**\n\n\n\n\"Corona is for Mexicans!\" - USA \n\n   https://imgur.com/gallery/fNYtCIf\n\n     3/5 - 3,876,816 **(2/27-3/5 +28,566)**\n\n\n\n\"Uh oh...\" - Dr. Fauci \n\n  https://imgur.com/gallery/OmXymZN\n\n     3/11 - 3,897,224 **(3/5-3/11 +20,408)**\n\n\n\n\"Forrest Gump Gets Two Weeks Off!\" Starring Tom Hanks as Tom Hanks.\n\n   https://imgur.com/gallery/yr9yzsD\n\n     3/18 - 4,009,794 **(3/11-3/19 +112,570)** \n\n\n\nJ Pow's Printing Presses fire up at limited capacity and Trump gets serious. \n\n   https://imgur.com/gallery/9DjtLzq\n\n     3/25 4,365,282 - **(3/18-3/25 +355,488)**\n\n\n\nJ Pow puts his presses into the redline and murders our Puts with green. \n\n   https://imgur.com/gallery/31KZJME\n\n**THE NUMBERS:**\n\n\"Okay... Cool numbers retard, strike price and date or ban.\" Shut up, WSBGod is dead and I'm grieving with your wife. \n\nHere are the numbers:\n\n2/19-3/11\n\nMean: 19,135 \n\n*Cool?*\n\nLet's assume the Fed was spending the average amount through this beer virus... That stupid mean is the number I'm using to show you just how badly they're freaking out. \n\nWhen they went from '19,135' to 112,570 that was an increase of 92,162 OR **488.2%.**\n\nWhen they went from 20,408 on 3/11 to 112,570 it was an **451.5% increase in a fucking week.** \n\n**THIS WEEK THEY HELD NOTHING BACK**\n\nWhen they went from 112,570 on 3/19 to 355,488 on 3/25 it was a **215.7% increase from our 451.5%.** \n\nNot only that, but it was a **1,757.7% increase from our 3-week mean!!**\n\nSo... WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?\n\nTL;DR\n\nAll this goes to show the fed blew the market up this week because they're scared. This is a bull trap. The Fed knows our stock market is on a ventilator and dammit, 79 year old Jerry needs that ventilator after he sold everything he owned on the dip. The Fed knows it's only a matter of time before this collapses. It's the end of the month, companies are \"rebalancing\" **aka pulling out like your dad should've.** Your puts will thrive, the Fed cannot keep increasing by 215% each week, we'll go into hyperinflation. The Fed are printing but it's doing nothing but pushing back the inevitable... **HOLD THOSE PUTS.**\n\nEdit: It's been brought to my attention that you all really are retarded and have no idea why \"Big increase = Bad\" so here is a nice comment I received explaining it decently well... I'm lazy and don't want to type one but I will if needed.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpjjde/i_crunched_the_feds_spending_and_it_says_more_puts/flldgk5/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf", "created_utc": 1585256337.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpjjde/i_crunched_the_feds_spending_and_it_says_more_puts/", "is_self": true}
