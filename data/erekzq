{"id": "erekzq", "title": "r/WallStreetBets - let's fund an autistic Mecca", "selftext": "I know many of you have made sweet sweet tendies on YOLO $TSLA and $QQQ calls lately, and with those green beans burning a hole in your pocket, I am here to propose the latest and greatest investment opportunity for all of the savants found here:\n\nWe buy a small town in the upper-Great Lakes region. Think about it--There is little to no manf/economy outside of tourism and mining (and although the appeal of black lung is real, there isn't much mining left at this point) leaving current residents to pretty much do heroin/drink or work at the bar. We, as the autistic saviors of Reddit, should buy/develop a massive gay space commune in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. \n\nMy suggestion would be Munising, Michigan (Pictured Rocks), but we'll have to deal with the NPS pussies tryina tell us what to do. We could get high speed satellite internet and maybe a central Marijuana grow house for all.  \n\nI have gotten together with a few friends (a Ross UofM grad &amp; a JPM Chase Banker, I work in Commercial Risk) and we are here to present a magnificent investment opportunity: We should build a savant commune in the Yoop, develop a few businesses that utilize USPS/e-commerce (it is the great equalizer for places like the Yoop. Think about it), and we employ the depressed locals. Now we are the local economic overlords, and we can use that position to become Municipal Council, Mayor, Sheriff etc. We can come up with all sorts of wacky ass laws. \"ALL HOUSES MUST BE PURPLE\" and other dumb ideas we vote on.\n\nMinimum buy-in would be $1,000. I've done a little guestimation, and I believe with around $2M you can buy the loyalty of a small town in the yoop. With $500k we can build a small commune for 10-20 autizens. That's not very much money.\n\nInterested investors plz PM with interest.", "created_utc": 1579533899, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/erekzq/rwallstreetbets_lets_fund_an_autistic_mecca/", "is_self": true}
