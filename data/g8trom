Feels like the week of April 27, 2020 is driven by excitement of upcoming tech earnings, S&P 500 earnings, and therapeutic results for COVID-19 (specifically, Remdesivir). My background is in health economics with a bit of epidemiology. I don't know what the results of the Remdesivir study will show, but there are a few levers to think through when the initial results are released. Also, I'm not a pharmacist or pharmacologist, so I don't understand the details on mechanism of action, etc. (if you think Remdesivir is the silver bullet, please enlighten me).\n\nIn this post, I'll describe my personal thoughts on the following areas:\n\n1. Ongoing Remdesivir studies and how to track them\n2. Limitations on administration of Remdesivir\n3. A couple thoughts on antibody testing press releases\n\n**1) Ongoing Remdesivir studies and how to track them**\n\n[ClinicalTrials.gov](https://ClinicalTrials.gov) is a great website where you can track a ton of clinical studies going on all over the world. I've done the homework for you, so you can click this link to view the ongoing Remdesivir studies: [Remdesivir CT.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=&term=remdesivir&cntry=&state=&city=&dist=). You'll see the terminated and suspended studies in China at the top of the page, along with plenty of others.\n\n**Study of interest:** Here is the page for [**NCT04280705**](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04280705), the study we expect results for in a couple weeks. This study enrolled 572 patients at 68 sites, which provides good generalizability. However, there are few things to consider when critiquing the results from this study when they come:\n\n* Inclusion/exclusion criteria:\n   * The study includes patients who have one of the following: diagnostic imaging indicating issues, SpO2 <= 94%, requiring supplemental oxygen, or requiring mechanical ventilation. Obviously, **these are four VERY different steps** in the treatment pathway. **Subgroup analysis, and possibly adjustment for confounders, is needed in this study.** Otherwise, we might show Remdesivir works in a biased set of patients/situations since the inclusion criteria is so broad for only 572 patients.\n\n**2nd Study of interest:** The Remdesivir study I'm most interested in is [**NCT04292899**](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04292899?term=remdesivir&draw=3&rank=3), which is a Phase 3 study evaluating two Remdesivir regimens (5- and 10-day). I haven't seen this reported in too many places (except WSB!), but this study increased enrollment from 2400 to 6000 patients recently. This may have one or more implications:\n\n* Remdesivir isn't the silver bullet we were hoping for as a society.\n* Remdesivir is working, but only in a subset of patients (likely healthier patients or patients treated earlier in the disease onset).\n* GILD wanted to increase access to the drug, so they upped the sample size\n* GILD wanted to do a little p-hacking and get a p < .05, so they increased the sample size by 2.5x.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2) Limitations on administration of Remdesivir**\n\nLook, even if Remdesivir works (and it might!), it will probably be most effective when given early in the onset of COVID-19. What happens when you call your doctor to get tested today? **They tell you to stay home and wait until your symptoms get worse.** Once you are almost sick enough for the hospital, you can finally get tested.\n\nHere's the issue -- **Remdesivir is only available intravenously (!!!)**.  This means if you contract COVID-19, you will need to get tested early and find a hospital bed where they can hook you up to a 5- or 10-day drip. You likely need to be in the hospital for this because side effects might affect your vital organs (*any doctors in the crowd think Remdesivir can be administered at home?*).\n\n**If we can test early enough to identify these ideal Remdesivir patients**, then patients might clog  up hospitals to get their Remdesivir drip. This should weigh heavily on health care providers (e.g HCA, THC) and elective surgery companies (e.g. SIEN).\n\n**I'm skeptical we will find suspected cases early enough for Remdesivir to be an effective therapeutic.** However, I do think the market will still rise heavily on optimism of a cure before it realizes in early summer that Remdesivir isn't all it's hyped up to be and we still don't have a vaccine (oh, and we still have 16-20% unemployment, etc.). I feel really dumb for fighting the money printer, but I imagine I'll add to my cash or short positions if SPY gets close to 310.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3) A couple thoughts on antibody testing press releases**\n\nFrom my understanding of the antibody testing development and rollout, the FDA provided guidance that companies should manufacture tests with > 90% specificity (true positive rate). However, under an emergency use authorization the FDA has not reviewed the validation data on these tests. There are countless articles stating that many more people have antibodies than we ever thought possible. Here's why that's wrong.\n\nLet's assume the following:\n\n1. Antibody test specificity = 95% (a good test!)\n2. Antibody test sensitivity = 100% (wow, this test kicks ass!)\n3. Disease prevalence = 2% (estimated rounding 50,000 deaths / 1% IFR \\~ 1.4% of US)\n\nIf we test a population of 100 people with a test with parameters #1 & #2 above and a 2% disease prevalence, we will expect to find the 2 confirmed cases and 5 false positives. That means 71% (5/7th) of our positive results will be false positives.\n\n**If either: (1) the test is shittier than the one I described (**[**because 90 companies make them!**](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/19/us/coronavirus-antibody-tests.html)**); or (2) the disease prevalence in the locale tested isn't as high, the ratio of false positives to true positives will grow!**\n\nHell, even the CEO of Roche said the antibody testing is \"[a disaster](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/covid-19-antibody-testing-a-disaster-says-roche-ceo-as-its-diagnostics-sales-rise)\"!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPositions: Max my 401(k) to buy stonks, IWM 122p 8/21, IWM 110p 10/16\n\nEdit: Added GILD ticker so people can find this post when filtering.
