{"id": "bcufzd", "title": "Buying the Healthcare Provider Dip Ahead of Tuesday: An Incredibly Reckless Thought Only a Complete Degenerate Would Consider but Maybe Has Some Potential", "selftext": "I want to start off by saying the healthcare provider/insurance sector faces [colossal regulatory and political headwinds](https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/379714/healthcare-stocks-in-focus-on-regulatory-and-political-risk). Obamacare uncertainty, Medicare for All propositions by most democratic candidates, drug price control measures, drug rebates, etc. In fact, it is foolish to even write this post. But there is upside here people maybe overlooking and that is why I am posting this DD in this sub and not a responsible one. \n\n[On Tuesday, UnitedHealth Group reports their earnings](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whats-store-unitedhealth-unh-earnings-135701718.html). UNH will be the first healthcare provider to report this quarter and I believe its guidance can potentially reverse the entire sector. UNH and providers like it are in unique positions. They never had the ability to recover from the December dip, only falling lower from December lows when Medicare for All rumors started in January and a [bill was introduced in February](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1384/text). On April 10th [Bernie Sanders introduced his own Medicare for All bill](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-how-bernie-sanders-says-he-would-fund-medicare-for-all-2019-04-10). Predictably, all of these stocks plummeted even more after modest March gains with Friday drops of 5-8% for most stocks. [UNH saw its biggest 2-day selloff in 10 years in wake of Bernie Sanders' health plan](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/unitedhealths-stock-suffering-biggest-2-day-selloff-in-10-years-in-wake-of-bernie-sanders-health-plan-2019-04-12). There is a very small chance any of this will ever be law yet here we are. [Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi doesnt even like Medicare for All](https://splinternews.com/healthcare-lobbyist-tells-other-goblins-that-pelosi-won-1834008350).\n\nThat said there are only a handful of providers publicly traded and each feed off of each other. That is why UNH\u2019s earnings will have huge implications for the sector.  These stocks have been kept down on fear despite revenue and earnings growth. Any positive assurance by UNH could send the whole sector flying. Most stocks are down 25-30% from 52-week highs set in December (pre-dip) and will have room to run if reversal happens. This is a complete gamble but the upside is there. Will the rumors of medicare for all keep going? Does a bear shit in the woods? 2020 primary debates will be starting soon so I am not saying to hold long but a post-UNH calls are just the right amount upside to lose all your money on. \n\n I like $CI, $MOH, $ANTM calls here. Relatively low p/e\u2019s, decent profit margins for the sector, RSI\u2019s under 40, and earnings late enough in April/May to avoid paying premiums on calls. $CI has a [partnership with Amazon](https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/371496/cigna-express-scripts-join-amazon-alexa-for-new-voice-skills) and [acquired Express Scripts in December](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20181220/NEWS/181229999/cigna-and-express-scripts-close-on-67-billion-merger). Again, tremendous risk, and I have no idea why I bother to write this. Its pure negligence but a juicy opportunity amidst panic in the streets. You're essentially gambling that UNH\u2019s earnings and guidance to be good enough to reverse the entire sector\u2019s downtrend. It is a huge task for UNH and they will need to knock it out of the park. You can bet on UNH earnings but the premiums might be too high for the tremendous risk involved.", "created_utc": 1555184973, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bcufzd/buying_the_healthcare_provider_dip_ahead_of/", "is_self": true}
