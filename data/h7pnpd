{"id": "h7pnpd", "title": "SPAC IPO with NFL GPAQ, the next NKLA / VTIQ", "selftext": " \n\nAlright you degenerates, I\u2019ve got the next big stock for you all called Gordon Pointe Acquisition Corp GPAQ. I bought VTIQ at $16 and sold at $90 after IPOing as NKLA. This stock is going to do the same. GPAQ is a SPAC company that is set to merge with the NFL Hall of Fame Village. They have a solid board of directors with a number of NFL investors. The merger has to get approved by the board of directors on June 30th before it IPOs. If you buy after the merger vote, the price of this stock will already be too high. The merger vote will 99.9% pass given how much money has been invested by the NFL. Once the news hits and the reverse IPO happens, this stock could go to $50-70 range! The risk/reward is great because since it is a SPAC, the stock price can\u2019t go lower than how much money was raised by investors. This stock is going to get a lot of press from the NFL and the TV media.\n\nTLDR: Why Invest in GPAQ?\n\n\\- Comparable to $DIS.\n\n\\- Potential 5x bagger.\n\n\\- Merging with HOFV, a NFL Hall of Fame Village Park.\n\n\\- NFL investors and solid board of directors including past Disney Execs.\n\n\\- Upcoming vote meeting on June 30 for the merger\n\n\\- Since this is a SPAC, the stock price can\u2019t go lower than how much was raised. ( can\u2019t go lower than $10 per share)\n\n\\- Anticipated high media coverage on this deal (NFL, NBC) which will drive prices higher", "created_utc": 1591984665.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h7pnpd/spac_ipo_with_nfl_gpaq_the_next_nkla_vtiq/", "is_self": true}
