I yolo\u2019d almost all of it on amd 3/20 60c and waited for the cash to come in while debating if I should throw in the rest of my savings account because I know FOR A FACT that I\u2019m going to make money off of it. I\u2019ve been bent over by Wells Fargo the last 2 days now and I don\u2019t like it. This morning I woke up after dreaming about buying puts on Africa\u2019s $WATR and $FOOD stocks and becoming a millionaire, cause you know they never have either of those. I\u2019m dreaming about options, thinking about options, and having withdrawal because I don\u2019t have the buying power to throw down on some more meme pump stocks. The news that Wells Fargo is getting sued for fraudulent practices and the whispers of amds comeback next week made me excitedly shit myself and chew on the dollar bills in my wallet. This Monday I\u2019m back and ready to be more autistic than ever. Thank you for coming to my Ted talk. \n\nTL;DR: Buy puts on Africa\u2019s $WATR and $FOOD", "created_utc": 1582334738, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7lc1s/i_have_an_addiction_and_im_only_2k_in/", "is_self": true}
