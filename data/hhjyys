Apologies for the shitty formatting. Net of the note is that PRPL has generated nearly $70mm of cash in the first two months of Q2, which means profits are surging beyond imagination through its DTC transformation. The share price at $18 drastically undervalues this.\n\nA few facts:\n\n- At Q1 end, the company reported $26mm of cash, 42mm of inventory, and 52mm of accounts payable\n- As of the business update released in early June, the company reported a May month end cash balance of $96 million (an increase of $70 million in just two months as sales increase)\n\nhttps://investors.purple.com/press-releases/news-details/2020/Purple-Innovation-Provides-Business-Update-Ahead-of-Participation-in-Oppenheimer-20th-Annual-Consumer-Growth-Conference/default.aspx\n\n- In May alone, they recorded 90mm plus of orders, 71m from DTC, an increase of 125%\n- The company has nearly 50mm shares outstanding fully diluted, an enterprise value of nearly $1B, and 25mm of EBITDA, trading at a 17x multiple \n\nSo let\u2019s talk about cash. If the company\u2019s cash in April and May increased solely on operating income, that would mean they generated an incremental 70mm of EBITDA and nearly $1.40 per share. However, this is likely overstated as the company noted inventories decreased and DTC orders are cash in advance (you pay before you get the product).\n\nLet\u2019s assume inventory declined by 25%, which is a massive number operationally particularly as sales are increasing, which would explain $10mm of the cash increase. The other variable is the uplift from DTC, which has grown from a run rate of about 20-30mm a month in Q1 to 70mm of orders in May. The question is what value between 0 and 70 did cash benefit by customers paying cash ahead of receiving inventory (deferred revenue) vs what was recognized into earnings. Because DTC has been ramping through the last 60-90 days, I\u2019d think this has been normalizing to a steady state at this point. Let\u2019s assume half is a working capital benefit. \n\nSo of the 70mm cash benefit, 35 was from DTC pre orders and 10 mm from inventory, leaving 25mm for true cash from earnings. On 50mm shares, that is 50 cents a share for the first two months of the quarter. Assume another month of consistency to April and May, you are at 0.75 a share, just in one quarter on an 18 dollar share price. \n\nAssuming that is right, that means EBITDA is doubling for the full year in just one quarter and in track to generate nearly 150mm of EBITDA for the next year. \n\nGiving them a 10x multiple (consistent with TPX) implies 50% upside to the share price. Giving them a growthier multiple due to surging demand, which is appropriate - let\u2019s say 15x to be conservative - would imply a 2.3b tev, or 100%+ upside to the share price in the near term. \n\nWhen will the market appreciate this and price it in? Well, they should already but because the company is newer and less followed, they aren\u2019t yet. But once earnings are crystallized in q2 and announced in mid August, it should be obvious to all. My guess is shares will be trading at or north of $30 once earnings are released.\n\nCOVID appears to be accelerating their DTC momentum and mgmt is more or less telling us they will have an absolute blow out quarter by giving us their end of month cash balances.\n\nCash does not lie and is king. \n\nLong Jan 21 17.50 calls", "created_utc": 1593370262.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hhjyys/prpl_cash_is_king_and_upside_unappreciated/", "is_self": true}
