{"id": "d6kb0e", "title": "Options market 9/19/19", "selftext": "ource: Schwab Center for Financial Research\n\nToday\u2019s Bullish Activity\n\nRallying to all-time highs this morning is Microsoft Corp. (MSFT + $3.13 to $141.65) after the software giant announced an 11% increase in its quarterly dividend (from $0.46 to $0.51/share) and approved a new share repurchase program of up to $40B. Separately, Indian movie producer Eros international announced a collaboration to build an online video platform on MSFT\u2019s Azure cloud platform. Calls are outnumbering puts roughly 5:2 with the September 20th 142.00 call seeing the most action from traders (volume is 25,849).  \n\nAlso trading to the upside is Miller Herman Inc. (MLHR + $2.77 to $47.24) after the furniture company reported fiscal Q1 earnings of $0.84 per share ($0.06 beat) on revenue that increased 7.4% year-over-year to $670.9M (above the $661.8M consensus estimate). New orders increased 6.9% while sales and orders increased 7.7% (above the respective +6.0% and 7.7% consensus estimates). The company issued upside guidance as Q2 EPS is expected to come in a range of $0.85-0.89 on revenue of $685-705M (vs. the respective $0.85 and $684.83M consensus estimates). Shares of MLHR hit a 52-week high of $49.40 earlier in the trading session. Calls are outpacing puts roughly 3:1 with the October 18th 50.00 call topping the most actives list (volume is 864).\n\nLastly, shares of Twilio Inc. (TWLO + $1.76 to $114.31) are gaining ground after Morgan Stanley upgraded the cloud communications provider to \u201cOverweight\u201d from \u201cEqual-Weight\u201d and bumped their price target to $135.00 from $130.00. Calls are outnumbering puts nearly 3:1 which is primarily being driven by activity on the September 20th 115.00 call (volume is 1,557).\n\n \n\nNew 52-week highs (55 new highs today): Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT - $0.18 to $51.91), Hartford Financial Services Group (HIG + $0.17 to $60.99), Sysco Corp. (SYY - $0.10 to $78.76), Vulcan Materials Company (VMC + $1.44 to $150.09)\n\nNotable Call Activity\n\nSome unusual call activity (~8:1 over puts) is being seen in Morgan Stanley Inc. (MS + $0.03 to $44.39) which is primarily being driven by activity on the November 18th 46.00 call. Volume on this contract is 11,931 (vs. open interest of 1,154) which mostly consisted of a 7,248 block that was bought for $1.02 when the bid/ask spread was $0.92 x $1.03. We know this block is a new position based on the open interest figure and we can assume the intent is bullish in nature since the trade took place above the midpoint of the bid/ask spread.  \n\nToday\u2019s Bearish Activity \n\nShares of Darden Restaurants Inc. (DRI - $5.79 to $121.34) are gapping down below the 50-day SMA this morning after the operator of Olive Garden, Longhorn Steakhouse and Cheddar\u2019s Scratch Kitchen restaurants reported fiscal Q1 earnings of $1.38 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.02 beat) on revenue of $2.13B year-over-year (in-line with estimates) as blended same-restaurant sales increased 0.9% year-over-year. Looking ahead, the company reaffirmed full-year 2020 EPS of $6.30-6.45 on revenue of $8.96-9.05B (vs. the respective $6.41 and $9.03B consensus estimates) with same-store sales growth expected to be +1-2%. Puts are outnumbering calls roughly 5:2 with the September 20th 120.00 put garnering the most attention from traders (volume is 1,440).\n\nAlso trading to the downside is US Steel Corp. (X - $1.69 to $10.76) after the steel maker lowered guidance last night after the market close. The company said that it expects to report a Q3 adjusted loss of $0.35 per share (worse than the $0.10 loss analysts had modeled) and said it will continue to idle two blast furnaces until the end of the year. Commenting on the outlook the company stated, \u201cThe impact of falling steel prices through the second quarter, combined with the impact of a larger than expected drop in scrap prices on market sentiment, is expected to negatively impact flat-rolled earnings in the second half of the year. Puts are outnumbering calls nearly 2:1 with the September 20th 10.00 put leading the way (volume is 8,489).  \n\nLastly, shares of Costco Wholesale Co. (COST - $7.40 to $285.03) are under pressure after Bernstein downgraded the warehouse club operator to \u201cUnderperform\u201d from \u201cMarket-Perform\u201d while increasing their price target to $230.00 from $220.00, citing valuation and potential risks to the pace of growth. Shares of COST are trading roughly 1% above the 50-day SMA (currently $282.33) this morning. Calls and puts are trading roughly even with the September 20th 285.00 put being the most actively traded contract (volume is 1,551).\n\n \n\nNew 52-week lows (8 new lows today): EZCORP Inc. (EZPW - $0.83 to $7.42), Home Services Inc. (AHPI - $0.05 to $7.15), Viveve Medical Inc. (VIVE - $0.83 to $6.97)\n\nNotable Put Activity\n\nSome unusual put activity (9:1 over calls) is being seen in Macy\u2019s Inc. (M - $0.25 to $16.02) as option traders primarily target the October 18th 15.00 put. Volume on this contract is 26,824 versus open interest of 5,220, so we know that this primarily represents new positioning. The majority of the transactions on this contract mostly consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought at various times at the ask prices of $0.30 and $0.31, which suggests bearish intent.\n\niShares Silver Trust ETF (SLV + $0.10 to $16.65): Some unusual put activity is being seen on the SLV October 4th 15.50 put as volume is 39,904 versus open interest of 311, so we know this is primarily represents new positioning. Transactions mostly consisted of various-sized blocks (2,828, 2,034, 1,722, 1,020, 1,000 etc.) that were bought at the ask price of $0.04, which suggests bearish intent.\n\nVolume Signals     \n\niShares MSCI Hong Kong ETF (EWH - $0.21 to $23.43): Option volume is running at over 60x the daily average of 955 contracts which is primarily being driven by some block activity out on December 20th expiration:\n\n24.00 put \u2013 a 26K block was bought at the ask price of $1.50 (open interest is 28,665)\n23.00 put \u2013 a 26K block was simultaneously traded for $1.00 (open interest is 2,944)\nBased on the open interest figures it appears that a previously held short 26K block was rolled down to the 23.00 put, which would suggest that the block trader now believes that EWH will remain above the $23.00 price level instead of a prior view above the $24.00 price level at expiration (which would indicate a slightly less bullish view).\n\nUnited Natural Foods Inc. (UNFI - $0.68 to $12.72): Option volume is running at over 10x the daily average of 1,241 contracts which is primarily being driven by a couple of fairly large blocks that simultaneously traded out on the February 2020 expiration:\n\n10.00 put \u2013 a 5,000 block was bought for $0.80 when the bid/ask spread was $0.65 x $0.85 (open interest is 31)\n5.00 put \u2013 a 7,500 block was sold for $0.03 (open interest is 7,604)\nBased on the open interest figures it appears that a previously held long put position was rolled up (from the 5.00 to the 10.00 strike) and decreased in size (from 7,500 to 5,000 contracts), which suggests that the block trader is still bearish on this name, though perhaps not as bearish as when the position was initiated.  \n\nNielsen Holdings PLC (NLSN + $0.22 to $22.96): Today\u2019s option volume is 18,453 (vs. average daily option volume of only 250) and the activity is definitively call-biased. Option traders were primarily targeting two contracts:\n\nFebruary 2020 25.00 call (volume is 12,191 vs. open interest of 35) \u2013 transactions mostly consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought at the ask price of $1.20   \nNovember 25.00 call (volume is 10,946 vs. open interest of 587) \u2013 transactions mostly consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought for $0.70   \nWe know we have mostly new positioning on both of these contracts given the respective open interest figures and we can assume the intent is bullish in nature since the trades mostly consisted of buys.\n\nGauging Volatility\n\nThe CBOE Volatility Index (VIX - 0.41 to 13.54) has been on both sides of the unchanged line today (intraday range is 13.31-14.66) as equity markets are higher around the mid-day mark today (DJI + 82, SPX + 10, COMPX + 38). VIX option volume has been light today at 174,730 contracts (#8 on the top 10 most actives list) and the activity has been call-biased (the volume put/call ratio is currently 0.48). However, the most actively traded contract is the October 16th 16.00 put as volume is 23,657 versus open interest of 125,613.", "created_utc": 1568927081, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d6kb0e/options_market_91919/", "is_self": true}
