I found my lost tendies and was back to 2.4k, and remembered that\u2019s what I started with this morning and I can\u2019t just use my last day trade and break even for the day, with tomorrow still left in my FD contracts... had to get them tendies.\n\n2.4k was the high for the day, not bad. Autism FDs. Still dropping a deuce, bc autist tendies are distracting, I then watched ROKU lose steam, from what was the high point, fall and fall, until I had~ 900~bucks. So I took a 1 hr shit to not sell my 150% gain (in 15 min) to under 4 figures.\n\n When my account lost that comma, I went full autist man saw MSFT down before earnings. Got 7  137 FDs at 1.40. But when I got that comma back I went autist again, sold 7 140 FD at .50 or so. And with that 350 went more autie and a bit Becky, 6 SBUX FD 91 at .20. \n\nSBUX FD now at .67... \n\nI will be selling these at 3:15 to ensure max gains\n\n\nMoral of the day: autism got me here and it will continue to guide me. \n\nI can\u2019t remember if I wiped my ass, however...", "created_utc": 1563508812, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cf2qnr/a_day_in_my_life_as_an_autist_who_enjoys_playing/", "is_self": true}
