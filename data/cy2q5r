In the following, I will be using LULU as reference for this DD strategy.\n\nAll related consumer products are not equal: e.g. women do not typically go buy leggins at Target, and then make instagram posts about it. However, designer brands, like LULU have obsessive fans who think showing off leggings from them is \ud83d\udd25 \n\nThere are brand and market analytics products already out there called \"social media listening\" (sometimes, social media monitoring). They track keywords, hashtags, comments, FB, IG, Twitter, etc. They're typically used by brands themselves to understand consumer engagement, trends, promotions, sentiment. Furthermore, industry competitive analysis is typically supported as well. e.g. comparing #nike to #lululemon\n\nI want to see if there are strong correlations using all social activity in the previous quarters and see if they can predict earnings sentiment / forward guidance. As stated above, I don't think this would work for all consumer brands though.\n\nThe leading software out there seems to be: Netbase, Sprinklr, and Synthesio - all of these seem to cost tens of thousands of dollars per year. I'm thinking of building my own and either leveraging Google Cloud or Azure for sentiment analysis of people posts/tweets/etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo you guys think this is worth the time to invest in?", "created_utc": 1567294574, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cy2q5r/lulu_predictive_earnings_through_social_listening/", "is_self": true}
