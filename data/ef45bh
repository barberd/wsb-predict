Assuming you could get the trade to execute, buying the $25 call and selling the $23 call should be free money no? Now I imagine the difference is mainly due to RH display choices and that the bid/ask on the trade would keep if from being possible but my question is more \"if it executed\"", "created_utc": 1577207759, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ef45bh/inverted_breakeven/", "is_self": true}
