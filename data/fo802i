{"id": "fo802i", "title": "My fellow bears...", "selftext": "This is the time to speak the truth frankly and boldly. This great Nation will endure as it has endured. It will revive and will prosper. But it won\u2019t happen today. It won\u2019t happen tomorrow, or next week or next month.\n\nMy fellow bears, I want to talk for a few minutes about confidence and courage. These are the essentials of success in printing tendies. You people must have faith. You must not be stampeded by rumors or guesses. We must not feel compelled when CNBC talking heads make Bill Ackman cry then tell us \u201cbuy the dip.\u201d\n\nThe challenge of the next month is whether we have the wisdom to endure staggering losses but refuse to waiver on our thesis. Coronavirus will further fuck and already fucked economy and market. The bulls who came before us made certain that this country rode high on the first waves of the post Great Recession funny money, the first waves of unheard of corporate debt and the first wave of unethical and irresponsible corporate buybacks.\n\nTendies don't belong to the faint-hearted but to the brave. When the coronavirus strikes, and it will strike hard, bulls will create an atmosphere of fear and tell you \"its priced in\" or \"the Fed has the cheat codes.\" Against the dark background of this global pandemic, I would like to present a few facts and angles that may encourage fellow bears to hold steady with the overwhelming fortitude and good temper with which only bulls could claim for the past 10 years.\n\n- NY cases are sky rocketing and we're still early\n- the entire country of India (1.3 billion) was just told to not leave their homes for 21 days\n- consider the above bullet, than consider how Trump wants us to go back to work next week because we've already 'learned a lot'\n- people wont be worrying about buying the next iPhone when their grandparents and parents are dying and cannot get medical care\n- many restaurants are estimating a more than 50% drop in revenue even when including to-go and delivery\n- unemployment may literally go to 20-30% and for every day the pandemic continues the number of surviving companies and jobs will decrease\n- companies will **still** have to pay back the loans for the cheap money they get to stay afloat, it will still be on their balance sheets\n- a $1000-$2000 stim shot is just enough for many people to pay rent and buy food let alone go shopping again when they just got laid off\n- even though tens of thousands of people are going to die, congress still cant get along well enough to pass a bill\n- pushes to open the economy in \"non hot zones\" will turn those zones into hot zones\n\n...the list is literally endless and the only thing bulls have to says is \"bUt ThE fEd\" despite the fact that the Fed continues to up their assistance and every time they do they're basically telling us that they think we're more fucked than their previous record breaking aid could handle\n\njust hold your damn puts or roll them out to a later date, fuck. \n\nSPY 160p 4/17, SPY 180p 7/17, YUMC 45p 7/17, LVS 35p 9/18, BAC 18p 9/18, SPCE 25p 10/16", "created_utc": 1585067258.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fo802i/my_fellow_bears/", "is_self": true}
