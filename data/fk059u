Their garbage UI helped me understand options in a clown like way, but it was inefficient.\n\nAlmost gave up on options. But on Feb 27 I saw the Wu Flu coming, liquidated my boomer positions and started paying Schwab 65\u00a2 a trick for SPY, AAL, ALK, JBLU, SAVE, UAL, CCL, RCL, NCLH, BKNG, TRIP, EXPE, MGM, LVS, WYNN, DIS, SIX, SEAS puts and VIXY calls. Made a few rookie mistakes along the way, but now my dick is starting to fly off.\n\nBeen holding with diamond hands through the volatility, but finally took some gains today. Sitting on \\~140k in cash overnight to buy the dead cat bounce with SPY (and maybe INDA) tomorrow.\n\nr/options is good for technical shit, but you retards are funny as fuck.\n\nThanks.\n\n[Progress.](https://preview.redd.it/ss8f7ghua6n41.jpg?width=3749&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3d365b5001fa67d946e1f8c2ffe6a5c000a66cb)", "created_utc": 1584424753.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fk059u/climbing_to_1000000_this_week/", "is_self": true}
