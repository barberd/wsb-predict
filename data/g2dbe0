{"id": "g2dbe0", "title": "Why Unemployment is actually Bullish in the short term.", "selftext": "I see many people using Unemployment as a barometer for bearish sentiment. However lets look at the numbers.\n\nThe average salary in the USA is around $56k; broken down that is $1150 USD a week.\n\nUnemployment benefits pay you half of your income, so normally on unemployment you would be making $575. However, with the extra $600 weekly to UI benefits you would be making $1175, actually more than what you would be making working.\n\nNow, not everyone makes $56k. Actually over 60% of people in the USA make LESS than $56k. This means that 60% of people in the USA are actually being payed more on unemployment than their actual jobs. So in reality; unemployment numbers = 60% of those people are getting more capital than the jobs they are leaving for the next few months. This is actually a conservative estimate since most of the people losing their jobs seem to be retail and hospitality which are around or below this $56k threshold", "created_utc": 1587037130.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2dbe0/why_unemployment_is_actually_bullish_in_the_short/", "is_self": true}
