While some parents play their newborns Mozart or Beethoven, I went above and beyond. Every morning and every night I would read him posts from WSB to teach him financial responsibility and \u201cknow how\u201d in hopes that he will become an expert trader and investor. Slowly, I have gotten signs that he is a young autist. While some babies first words are \u201cmama\u201d or \u201cdada\u201d, MY sons first words came while reading a post about MSFT calls. He excitedly shouted \u201cGUH\u201d when I read him the great ideas that my fellow investors have on WSB. We also play an investing game with chocolate candies. I give him him the choice of getting one piece of chocolate a day, or risk it all and get a years supply of chocolates now, but chance being left with nothing. YOU BETTER BELIEVE HE ALWAYS RISKS EVERYTHING. Just talking about this brings a tear to my eye. I\u2019m so proud of him and can\u2019t wait to see him grow up to be one of us!", "created_utc": 1581642332, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3kb3r/my_son_is_becoming_an_autist_and_ive_never_been/", "is_self": true}
