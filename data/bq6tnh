Well I'm a profitable autist. I held my AMD put spread expiring this Friday to fucking market close. Yes, AMD was up 2% all day and my account was down but I have giant juicy balls. AMD finally went down 2% one hour before close. Didn't realize RobinHood auto sells my options before market closed Friday, but that doesn't matter because I still made the GAINZ.\n\nI made fucking $300 dollars bitches. It may not seem like much but it's a fuck ton for me. And now I can borrow on margin to double my gainz.\n\nI went all in on Spy calls next week because Gyna knows Trump can fucking cause a recession in China with one tweet.\n\nI'll pay off my $500 payday loan as soon I'm over $2500. I gotta keep my margin enabled bitches. you\n\nHere's my portfolio if y'all wanna copy my success.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/9oIEnLA", "created_utc": 1558202377, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bq6tnh/making_gainz_on_my_payday_loan/", "is_self": true}
