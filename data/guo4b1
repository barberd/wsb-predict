{"id": "guo4b1", "title": "GEO - Invest in the riots with private prisons", "selftext": "If you\u2019re not investing in private prisons right now, channel your autism and try to pay attention for a couple minutes.\n\n* In the last 2 days 4,400 people have been arrested for rioting. Those numbers are about to go way up.\n* GEO is the second largest private prison stock in the US, and it\u2019s CEO George Zoley has been shovelling money into the Trump administration since 2016 in exchange for lucrative contracts ($225,000 given to the Trump Super PAC Rebuilding America Now in 2017 to start).\n* In 2019 GEO paid Ballard Partners, one of the most influential lobbying firms in Washington, $120,000 to lobby for public-private partnerships in correctional services. Ballard Partners is run by Brian Ballard who was a leading fundraiser for Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. He was also named regional vice chairman of the RNC finance leadership team in 2017.\n* The federal government generates 53% of the company\u2019s revenue.\n* GEO stock has recently slumped as a result of fewer people being arrested during the coronavirus stay at home orders, but since the pandemic has been cancelled and mass arrests are happening nationwide due to the riots, GEO stock has a lot of room to pump. I know we autists like to buy high and sell low but this is what traders call a \u201cdip\u201d which can be very profitable to buy.\n* Here\u2019s a map of GEO\u2019s prisons. Look at that and then look up a list of the cities that have the most riots. Spoiler, GEO\u2019s prisons are located in all of the major cities that have protesting and rioting. Their headquarters is in LA which had more arrests than any other city yesterday. ([https://www.geogroup.com/Locations](https://www.geogroup.com/Locations))\n* Koch Industries created the TPPF (Texas Public Policy Foundation) whose \u201cRight on Crime\u201d campaign successfully passed the \u201cFirst Step\u201d act in 2018 with the help of Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law. The bill created $375 million in funding for mandatory rehab and \u201cjob training\u201d for private prisons. The TPPF aims to \u201creduce government spending\u201d by encouraging the privatization of prisons and reducing partnerships with non-profit organizations which they did successfully. If you aren\u2019t seeing the pattern, Trump has a vested interest in private prisons, particularly GEO as he\u2019s buddies with the CEO.\n* GEO CEO George Zoley is also a long time contributor to Florida\u2019s governor Rick Scott, who is also close friends with Trump.\n* GEO increased their lobbying expenditures from $560k in 2015 to $1 million in 2016 to $1.7 million in 2017 and have been shovelling money at Trump and friends ever since.\n* GEO creates the tech used for house arrest and owns mental health facilities.\n* There are widely spread rumors that ICE will be using the riots in LA to round up immigrants. Maybe it\u2019s true, maybe not. Either way, GEO\u2019s headquarters are in LA and they have multiple facilities in LA. One way or another, this is going to be great business for GEO.\n\nWhat\u2019s the downside? Although GEO has plenty of volume, there is NO volume for higher strike prices. GEO is currently trading in at $12.63 (It was $12.10 when I started writing this post), and the strike prices of $14 is the highest you\u2019ll find any volume in. Since their stock was $17 in March, you\u2019re going to want to buy the cheapest FD\u2019s you can get.  I\u2019m currently loaded up with 6/19 $14, but am also buying a bunch of cheap FD\u2019s for higher strike prices in July when I can get them.\n\nTLDR: If you\u2019ve been living under a rock, there\u2019s a bunch of riots. Buy some private prison stock.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: GEO is already up 6% for the day. Wanted to let people know who are concerned about the ethical ramifications of investing in private prisons that I will be donating a lot of my gains to criminal justice reform charities through a donor advised fund. I recommend Googling that term if you're interested in doing the same.", "created_utc": 1591030306.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/guo4b1/geo_invest_in_the_riots_with_private_prisons/", "is_self": true}
