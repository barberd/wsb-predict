Some of them think they\u2019ve found the key to fast wins on the stock market. Wall Street doubts they\u2019re right, but it\u2019s getting nervous about what it sees there.\n\nHistory hasn\u2019t been kind to people claiming to have a magic hand. The latest sell-off, driven by a new wave of coronavirus fears, shows how quickly markets can turn on you. But even veteran traders have trouble dismissing a 900,000-user Reddit forum called\u00a0r/wallstreetbets, or r/WSB for short, whose tips and tactics have shown an uncanny ability to push prices, at least for the short term. Hitherto sleepy companies such as\u00a0Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc.\u00a0and\u00a0Plug Power Inc.\u00a0went\u00a0crazy\u00a0shortly after being mentioned there. The board may have added a little froth to\u00a0Tesla Inc.\u2019s $90 billion rally.\n\nThe do-it-yourself traders of r/WSB are waging a kind of guerrilla warfare in the markets, trying to exploit what they see as weaknesses in the system to move prices where they want them. For anyone who wondered about where the small day traders who made the 1990s so wild went, meet the 2020 version. After years of indifference, individual investors seem to be finding their wayback to stocks, for\u00a0better or worse. They\u2019re flexing muscles in ways that can easily call to mind excesses from the dot-com era.\n\n\u201cThere is no denying the fact that in the month of February 2020, the public is back,\u201d says\u00a0Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at\u00a0BTIG LLC. He thinks the S&amp;P 500 can jump an extra 10% because of small-investor enthusiasm. \u201cThis bull market is not going to end until the public falls in love with stocks, and that process may just be beginning.\u201d Of course, timing the moment when irrational exuberance gives way to a mass exit isn\u2019t so easy. Chatrooms where stocks were hyped are seminal artifacts of the 1990s boom and the following bust. They were a setting for bare-fisted digital brawls among all manner of hustlers and promoters, many of whom could move shares on a dime\u2014sometimes just enough so they could get out and leave others holding the bag.\n\nTwenty years later, one thing that\u2019s changed is the nomenclature. It\u2019s frequently both juvenile and objectionable. **For Reddit\u2019s band of self-styled \u201cautists\u201d\u2014a term of endearment**, relatively speaking, that crudely leans into stereotypes surrounding extremely online people\u2014the chief prize is \u201ctendies\u201d (chicken tenders, the treat an overgrown man-child receives for being a \u201cGood Boy\u201d). Figuratively speaking, tendies are the financial rewards that follow from a successful bold wager. Bears are usually referred to in homophobic terms.\n\nWhat this moment shares with 1999 is a rising belief that someone else will come along to buy a surging stock at an even higher price, regardless of fundamentals. But while traders at the end of the millennium were willing to wait around for a \u201cgreater fool\u201d to show up, this generation believes it can conjure up those buyers through its own trading sleight of hand.\n\nFeatured in\u00a0Bloomberg Businessweek, March 2, 2020.\u00a0Subscribe now.\n\nMembers of r/WSB believe they\u2019ve discovered a kind of perpetual motion machine in the interplay of stocks with options contracts, which offer a cheap way to bet on whether shares will rise or fall without buying the stock itself. It goes like this: Members make bets that rely on market makers, the professional middlemen who sell you a \u201ccall\u201d (a bet on shares rising) or a \u201cput\u201d (a wager on a decline). Market makers, like good bookies, don\u2019t want to go out on a limb. When taking a bet, they lay off the risk. If someone buys a call, for instance, speculating on a rally, the dealer buys stock in the underlying company. If the stock rises, the dealer may have to pay out on the option\u2014but that\u2019s offset by the gain on the shares.\n\nWhen shares keep rising, managing the hedge entails buying more stock. That\u2019s where the Reddit set perceives a weakness. A favorite tactic on r/WSB is to swamp the market with call purchases early in the morning in an attempt to force dealers to keep buying stock. Up and up everything goes\u2014supposedly. As the stock price rises, so does the value of the calls, often by far more.\n\nIn this worldview, the only constraint on success is the force of one\u2019s own conviction and willingness to act upon it. An added attraction: It\u2019s all relatively cheap in terms of an option\u2019s simple dollar cost. For the price of one share of\u00a0[Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) Inc.\u2014about $1,965 on Feb. 25\u2014a decent-size campaign can be waged in long-shot options trading for pennies. That matters nowadays, when the rise of exchange-traded funds and mutual funds has convinced U.S. companies that they no longer need to split their stocks to keep the share price manageable for retail investors. Many companies now trade for three or four figures a share.\n\nTo be clear, there\u2019s no magic money machine in options. The middlemen of the market are hardly the only players buying and selling stocks. If the rest of the market sees a reason to sell a company, it won\u2019t matter that r/WSB is pushing it. While options can produce eye-popping gains, they frequently expire worthless.\n\nBut suddenly bullish individual investors are putting their mark on the options market. How influential have they become? Typically puts are in higher demand than calls because traders are more interested in hedging against losses. That\u2019s often not the case now\u2014with some stocks, demand for the bullish calls is higher. \u201cThis is not normal,\u201d said\u00a0Amy Wu Silverman, an equity derivatives strategist at\u00a0RBC Capital Markets, on Bloomberg TV recently.\n\nBenn Eifert, chief investment officer at\u00a0QVR Advisors, was initially skeptical that the money behind these online message boards could sway anything. He changed his mind. \u201cAt least from the dealers\u201d\u2014the middlemen\u2014\u201cthey\u2019ll tell you in big tech names, flows are substantial, and it\u2019s moving things,\u201d he says. Smaller stocks are even more sensitive to sudden bursts of attention.\n\nBTIG\u2019s Emanuel says it\u2019s hard to say whether today\u2019s chatrooms or those in the late 1990s have bigger sway. \u201cWhen I was sitting in a proprietary trading room in 1999, you would see certain stocks be mentioned on message boards, and the process would then be one person saying to another, \u2018Hey, this looks interesting,\u2019\u2009\u201d he says. \u201cNow you see something on a message board, and you might not necessarily see a continued discussion.\u201d Instead, computerized traders automatically jump in. \u201cAs a human you never actually see the flow because it\u2019s going electronically,\u201d Emanuel says. In other words, don\u2019t just wag a finger at message boards\u2014look at the supposedly sophisticated algorithmic traders that are following them.\n\nMembers are aware that questionable thinking underpins their bets, to the point of self-deprecation. After user SolTrainRnsOnHolGran wondered whether r/WSB\u2019s activities might constitute insider trading, a user named recentlyunearthed replied, \u201cHow can we have insider knowledge when we don\u2019t have any knowledge?\u201d\n\nThe forum\u2019s zest for call options is a key force behind a broad market trend. By one measure, the value of options traded rose 77% over the first six weeks of 2020. Much of this expansion was concentrated in a handful of stocks popular among individual investors, says\u00a0John Marshall, head of derivatives research at\u00a0Goldman Sachs Group Inc. \u201cThe size of the increase in options volumes is definitely moving the needle,\u201d he says.\n\nThe average number of contracts purchased in a single-stock option trade shrunk to just 6.7 contracts in 2020, roughly half what it was in 2015, says\u00a0Henry Schwartz, president of Trade Alert LLC. Looking at the combination of small orders and heavy trading volume, he concludes, \u201cReally, retail is the only audience.\u201d\n\nAs the swashbuckling day trader\u2019s imprint on the market becomes more pronounced, moderators are getting stricter in their policing of the board\u2014or \u201csub,\u201d for subreddit. One user, who\u2019d been a member for three years without posting, laid out the bull case for\u00a0Lumber Liquidators Inc.\u00a0and promised another pick the following morning. Call volumes in the company jumped to 71 times the previous one-month average, with shares rising 18.6%. This user was promptly banned from r/WSB upon providing the next tip, with a moderator claiming that the poster \u201ctried to use the platform for personal gain.\u201d Members were warned that any interactions with the user on Reddit or discussion of the user\u2019s latest recommendation would also get them kicked out. \u201cThis sub is a travesty,\u201d wrote user Deftech1, complaining about the influx of those looking for\u2014or pushing\u2014get-rich-quick schemes. \u201cCan we just go back to losing inordinate amounts of money?\u201d", "created_utc": 1582721067, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9so12/reddits_profane_greedy_traders_are_shaking_up_the/", "is_self": true}
