{"id": "cp4e97", "title": "Fuck CGC. Long MedMen.", "selftext": "**USA  &gt; Canada**\n\nThe Canadian cannabis market is saturated and over-regulated. Canopy and the other big players in Canada have made too many bad investments and are going to be suffering from goodwill impairment and writedowns, with lower than expected revenues due to Canada's pussyfooting on regulations. The US is far different, and allows for advertising, branding, without a government middleman stealing profit margins. MedMen is the largest cannabis retailer in California, a state with higher population and usage rates than all of Canada combined. Medmen has  [7% of the market share in California](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190529005899/en/MedMen-Reports-Quarter-Fiscal-Year-2019-Financial). Analysts believe that [California could reach $25 billion in sales by 2026](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/california-cannabis-market-expected-to-reach-51-billion-market-value-685917412.html), while the rest of the entire US combined only accounting for $25 billion.\n\n**The Cronos Connection**\n\nGotham Green Partners recently committed to a total of $280M USD investment in MedMen. This appears to be their largest investment made to date. Gotham Green were the early backers of Cronos (when it was known as PharmaCan Capital Corp).\n\n**The Chairman, President, &amp; CEO of Cronos-** **Mike Gorenstein** is a co-founder and member of **Gotham Green Partners.**\n\n**Independent Director of Cronos- Jason Adler** is a co-founder of **Gotham Green Partners** and is a Managing Member.\n\nUS Federal laws and American Exchange rules do not allow Cronos to invest in US cannabis companies. This is important to note, as it shows that Gotham Green could be acting as an investment arm of Cronos, and holding stakes in US companies for when the US federally legalizes, or when/if the STATES Act passes.\n\n**US Federal Law**\n\nUS Federal Laws do not allow banks to work with US cannabis companies. Therefore, hedge funds, and other institutional investors are extremely hesitant to invest in them. This is a very rare opportunity for retail to invest in companies before big money enters and drives prices up. The same thing happened in Canada not long ago.  The [current institutional ownership of MedMen is extremely low.](https://imgur.com/a/T7rzPfM) Check out [ACB's current ownership summary for comparison](https://imgur.com/a/BAm1nRR).\n\n**Market Manipulation &amp; Current Discount**\n\nMedMen has been beaten up in the media and shorts have been hammering the stock. Many retail investors have blacklisted the stock and refuse to invest in the company due to some very wild allegations and cash burn worries. The FUD spreading, combined with big money's inability to participate in the US cannabis industry, leaves for a discounted stock price.\n\nMedMen is currently trading at $2.41 CAD. This is well below Gotham Green Partners' average cost of $3.37 CAD.\n\nThe stock price tanking allowed Gotham Green Partners to get a repricing on their deal (was higher than $3.37 CAD before).\n\nI believe that it's probable that the stock was manipulated down to secure this better deal.  SEC Data  shows that on the run up to July 3rd, as the stock started to bounce back up, 305,732 shares were outstanding as \"failed to deliver\" by the required settlement date (July 3rd). This is highly suggestive of aggressive, manipulative, and likely, naked shorting. Fails-to-deliver represent \"I Owe You's\" given by the broker. Essentially the brokers were selling the stock so aggressively, they were unable to provide the actual stock by the settlement date required by SEC rules. The buyer still gets shares in their account, but the broker is required to obtain the stock to cover their \"I Owe You\" later on. This successfully caused the stock to go down due to demand drying up, which then allowed brokers to acquire the stock at a lower price, thus settling their fail-to-deliver. **The decrease in share price would be their profit to keep.** The lower the sentiment for the company, and lower demand, the easier it is to manipulate the stock downwards via this method.\n\nTo counteract this, large buying volume is needed. Sector catalysts such as SAFE Banking Act, STATES Act, FDA rescheduling, or simply increasing revenues could be enough to reverse this action. I also expect this manipulation to ease off as Gotham Green has now secured a better deal and significantly lowered their average cost.\n\nWith MedMen having lots of access to cash, they can fund aggressive expansion into the most lucrative states. They are anticipating 10 additional dispensaries open in Florida by the end of 2019. Their acquisition of PharmaCann makes them well prepared for Illinois adult-use legalization on January 1, 2019.\n\nWith NY and NJ expecting to legalize within the next year, MedMen will be extremely well positioned. PharmaCann, will provide MedMen with double the allowable number of dispensaries in New York if approved by the state. MedMen is a strong lobby group for NY Governor Cuomo, so I am hopeful. The PharmaCann deal is expected to receive Department of Justice and state approvals around Fall 2019.\n\n**Side note:** [This article](https://potstockz.com/pharmacann-breakdown/) explains how the PharmaCann acquisition amounts to a value of 25% of fully diluted MedMen upon deal closure. The poor stock performance will therefore equate to a lower $ price tag on the PharmaCann acquisition, which was regarded an amazing deal at the time of the acquisition- $682M USD. At today's MedMen share prices, they are only paying \\~$225M USD for PharmaCann. Deal provisions do not allow either side to back out due to share price fluctuations.\n\n**Branding &amp; Retail Domination**\n\nAside from my points above, MedMen seems to be the only company building an attractive, and recognizable brand  and retail experience. Last year, [MedMen outperformed Apple, Tiffany, and Starbucks](https://www.profitconfidential.com/stock/medmen-stock/pot-company-outperforms-one-metric/) in sales per square foot. Since these numbers were reached, they hired  [Apple Retail's former CFO](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181206005222/en/MedMen-Appoints-Veteran-Retail-Finance-Executive-Chief), Michael Kramer who is a retail expansion genius and the company is targeting a store average of  [$20 million in revenue in mature markets](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/edited-transcript-tmt-h-v-045914299.html).\n\n||Sales Per Square Foot|\n|:-|:-|\n|MedMen Stores|$6,188|\n|Apple Stores|$5,546|\n|Tiffany &amp; Co. Stores|$2,951|\n|Starbucks Stores|$1,339|\n\n**Revenues**\n\nIn April, MedMen announced pro-forma revenue of **$57 million USD**. Analysts are expecting Canopy Growth to announce revenue of **\\~$86 million USD**. MedMen's fully diluted market cap is \\~$920M USD compared to Canopy's fully diluted market cap of \\~$17.8B USD as of Friday's close.\n\n**Long and Strong**\n\nThe stock chart may look like shit but I'm buying at these levels due to the reasons mentioned above. My timeline is 1-3 years on this play. US legalization hype should give us a good pump around election time as well.  Until then, not having federal legalization provides MedMen with less competition and more ability to gain market share and brand awareness in this restrictive, and license capped environment.\n\nThe ticker is MMEN on the CSE. There's also warrants available for easy YOLOs.\n\nI don't think it's available on Robinhood, so most of you guys probably read all this for nothing. The rest of us will be smoking weed on our yachts in bright red MedMen jackets.", "created_utc": 1565567441, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cp4e97/fuck_cgc_long_medmen/", "is_self": true}
