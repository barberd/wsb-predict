I bought a decent amount of shares, 7% of my portfolio (a big posistion for indivdiual shares for me other than very safe blue chips/divended stocks, the rest of my money I YOLO with) for $220ish, down to $212/211 at time of posting\n\nI WAS very bullish on BABA. Now, it seems like the whole market is panicking over this stupid virus, I predict Chinese stocks are gonna be the most hammered\n\nWhat would y'all do? Sell? Average down? I should have bought a put yesterday to hedge but puts in this market seemed silly.
