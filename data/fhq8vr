Well today GDXJ dropped by 26% in ONE DAY...and for those fucking retards that forgot, these are the triple leverage junior mining gold stocks.\n\nJDST went up today 75%, and JNUG dropped 61% in 1 day. These are just the stock prices, not option prices.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBack in the crash of 2008, gold went down with the market initially due to all the margin calls, then skyrocketed afterwards. We are seeing these margin calls now, Ill be personally buying gold stocks soon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6dik0pvbxbm41.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b309a881e567e353ae4ce486bb5cbcbf49e3ea2\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zlwcd16kwbm41.png?width=701&format=png&auto=webp&s=582209f02465eefab171c828eb46d1ad662787be\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uq0zen8lwbm41.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=410f854313270fb4c42e7e1cafe22f84ca201e67\n\nTLDR: BUY GOLD STOCKS SOON, WILL MAKE TONS OF MONEY\n\nEDIT: To clarify, dont buy options on JDST and JNUG, they are super illiquid and have dogshit bid/ask spreads", "created_utc": 1584057119.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhq8vr/nobody_talking_about_gold_today/", "is_self": true}
