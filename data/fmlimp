Will edit with proof once it's chosen!\n\n[bby loss porn](https://imgur.com/a/4aUdsrU) \n\nStory time:\n\nSo was riding really high on wednesday since we all had been making bank off puts and then saw the quad witcher in /New and was immediately intrigued! I didn't even finish the DD post before putting 4.5k into it, and watched it more than double on thursday and didn't take any profits like a true autist. (when looking back on it, a lot of people must have covered then since because we got up to 246, almost 247)\n\nObviously i'm retarded and didn't read RH terms of expiration of options because, why would I? So I held through expiry and posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flib8u/witcher_yolo_35_320_calls/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)\n\nThankfully some of you were nice enough to let me know how autistic I was and I was able to exit the positions in the morning for only a 1k loss during the pump! Great news right?? I saved myself! But it wasn't to last..\n\nBeing as retard as I am, I rolled the shitty calls into shittier ones for 2/23-27 expecting the EOD pump. So now I've been double quad witched but thankfully learned my lesson and hopefully some of you idiots learn from me 2.\n\nPS - love you guys and hope everyone is safe and healthy, we're in crazy times and this community has kept me laughing the entire time, which is the most important part to keeping our humanity.", "created_utc": 1584821706.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmlimp/i_owe_69_to_charity_for_believing_in_witches_you/", "is_self": true}
