{"id": "cksa8u", "title": "The Election prophecy DD you din't know you needed", "selftext": "The cosmic energies have been thrown out of alignment and I was granted a vision. The coming struggle session of an election will not be kind. The first sign of things being fundamentally wrong, will be John Delaney's death. In an effort to increase his popularity and reach the younger generations, Delaney will decide to go on the Hot One's Youtube show. Things reach a culmination, when he and the host get ready to eat their last hot wings and apply the 'Last Dab' of hot sauce. A seizure strikes. Delaney's body is forced in to a [Deep Dab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ8dPgV9VVA) and he cannot take the strain. In his love for gym training, Delaney has forgone stretching and perishes from the pain.\n\nThe nation is shocked and the debates take on a somber air. Bernie Sanders forces a compliment for the dead capitalist out of his mouth on the debate stage and almost chokes on it. Steve Bullock performs the Heimlich maneuver while Marienne Williamson pours essential oils on Bernie's face. Joe Biden provides commentary. But this tiny moment of unity will not last. The debates turn truly bitter and accusations fly across the stage. Half of the field gets wiped out, when Adrew Yang's politics of fear collide with Williamson's energy of love and the resulting singularity sucks both the candidates and the attending audience to their doom. The TV-cameras follow as Beto O'Rourke screams in Spanish as his body stretches and finally disappears. His last words ring in the following emptiness: \"Mi sue\u00f1o era un mercado com\u00fan hemisf\u00e9rico y era hermoso.\"\n\nBy the time the first ballot for the nomination has been cast, there is no decisive victor and the field is very divided. Biden leads at 28 percent but Sanders, Warren, Harris, Buttigieg and Booker still cling on. Superdelegates were not allowed to vote on the first ballot. This is not the case with the second ballot. The superdelegates prove to be the deciding factor in Bidens victory, as Booker and Buttigieg drop out of the race and over 600 superdelegates cast their votes for him. Biden accepts the nomination wearing a cowboy hat. He steps to the podium with a winners smile and screams: \"I AM THE SENATE,\" in to his microphone while Nancy Pelosi runs around in the background, trying to cut his mike. This launches an unprecedented [shitstorm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy8nDb5nCak). Like monkeys, people fling their feces both online and in real life. Kamala supporters, Sanders supporters and Warren supporters feel betrayed. Biden enters the presidential election on very shaky ground.\n\nThe presidential debates between Trump and Biden are a disgrace. Biden attempts to talk policy but Trump sticks his fingers in his ears and makes monkey noises every time it is Biden's turn to speak. Things only unravel from there. \"Africans are so uncivilized, they aren't even comfortable wearing shoes!\" Trump yells and beats his fist to the podium. The press roars condemnation. \"What, I have the Big Brain and I am just quoting Reagan.\" The press quiets down and Fox news does an entire week of programming worshiping the Saint of conservatism.\n\nAs the race approaches it's conclusion Trump holds fewer and fewer public appearances. He begins to wear a ridiculous toupee and does not answer the confused journalists questions, when they wish to know what happened to his hair. On Tuesday, November 3, 2020, Biden loses the election. A tired and sickly looking Trump makes his victory speech hands holding on to the podium with a white knuckled grip. He has lost a lot of weight and has to stop half way through when his constitution fails him. Two weeks after his victory, President Trump dies of melanoma. The white house tanning bed is buried with him.\n\n[Mike Pence](https://imgur.com/gallery/j95n8) becomes the President of the United States of America.\n\nTLDR: Boot up that Grindr and go long on electricity providers and energy companies cos 2020 is going to see a surge in demand.", "created_utc": 1564684268, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cksa8u/the_election_prophecy_dd_you_dint_know_you_needed/", "is_self": true}
