You won't see us crying in the daily thread.\n\nThe **\"KANG GANG\"** or **\"ROO GANG\"** as some call us, is otherwise a group of autists that make sweet sweet tendies no matter which way the market swings in these times of war and aggression. \ud83e\udd98\ud83e\udd98\ud83e\udd98\ud83e\udd98\n\n**The Founding!:** \ud83e\udd98\ud83e\udd98\ud83e\udd98\ud83e\udd98\n\nOn June 12th, 2020. CNBC posted a picture of the markets, a Bull *(when market goes up), a Bear (when market goes down),* and a Kangaroo *(market goes up and down quickly)!* This movement was quick in WSB. Many converted, many asked questions and many made tendies. then Boom! the Kang Gang was born!\n\n[Kang Gang](https://www.reddit.com/r/KangarooGang/)\n\n[WSB CNBC Post with picture](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h7u3ea/breaking_cnbc_officially_gives_up_stocks_enter/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)\n\nThe Autists that made this possible,\n\nu/suitology, u/A-Ronyells, u/bobsagetsmomma, u/theCramps, u/newanonthrowaway,\n\nKangaroos plays are options. *If you want to hold a stock, go over to* [/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/).\n\n**Options Strategies :** *Basic definitions, if you want to learn more click the link and research for yourself, I am not your mom here to spoon feed you.*\n\n**Straddles:** A straddle is a neutral options strategy that involves simultaneously buying both a put option and a call option for the underlying security with the same strike price and the same expiration date.\n\n[Straddles](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/straddle.asp)\n\n**Strangles:**  A strangle is an options strategy where the investor holds a position in both a call and a put option with different strike prices, but with the same expiration date and underlying asset. A strangle is a good strategy if you think the underlying security will experience a large price movement in the near future but are unsure of the direction. However, it is profitable mainly if the asset does swing sharply in price.\n\n[Strangles](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strangle.asp)\n\n**Butterfly Spread:** A butterfly spread is an options strategy combining bull and gay bear spreads, with a fixed risk and capped profit. These spreads, involving either four calls or four puts are intended as a market-neutral strategy and pay off the most if the underlying does not move prior to option expiration.\n\n[Butterfly](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/butterflyspread.asp)\n\n**Iron Condor:**  An iron condor\u00a0is an options strategy created with four options consisting of two puts (one long and one short) and two calls (one long and one short), and four strike prices, all with the same expiration date. The goal is to profit from low volatility in the underlying asset. In other words, the iron condor earns the maximum profit when the underlying asset closes between the middle strike prices at expiration. *For those Roo's who want to keep shoving tendies in their pouch, during times of low Volatility*\n\n[Iron Condor](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ironcondor.asp)\n\n**Options Plays:**\n\nThe Kang Gang is a sucker for Volatility, This is our favorite play.\n\n[Volatility (VIX)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vix.asp)\n\n**Funds:**\n\n* S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (VXX),\n* S&P 500 VIX Mid-Term Futures ETN (VXZ),\n* VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (VIXY),\n* VIX Short-Term ETN (VIIX).\n\n*or if your a real fucking Kang Gang go big and play the with the big dick Roo's*\n\n\\&#x200B;\n\n* Daily Inverse VIX Short-term ETN (XIV)\n* Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (SVXY),\n* Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (UVXY),\n* Daily 2x VIX Short-Term ETN (TVIX),\n* Daily Inverse VIX Medium-Term ETN (ZIV)\n\n**Stonks:**\n\nAnything and everything, sometimes even hedging, As long as you have Calls and Puts on the underlying stock. *(usually VIX)*\n\n**Kang Gang is chill AF!**\n\nWhile we hop on in the daily thread and watch the Bulls and Bears meltdown over \"the LEG DOWN\" or \"LEG UP\" we chillin and know we ain't worried.
