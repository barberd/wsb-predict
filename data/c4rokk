Or will Bill be merciless and smite me with his Demi god power to remove such tendies? \n\nIf so, what macroeconomic powers will be at play? \n\nWill I have to break into ol\u2019 Hand Jobs\u2019 tomb to please his holiness? Stay tuned and share your \u201criveting\u201d thoughts if you\u2019d like!\n\nEDIT: I know Bill\u2019s not the CEO. He\u2019s just God of Nerddom and he should be recognized as such.", "created_utc": 1561396465, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c4rokk/gates_gang_gates_gang_gates_gang_msft/", "is_self": true}
