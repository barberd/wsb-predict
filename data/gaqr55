I\u2019d like to hear what the \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b have to say about this.\n\n1) Amazon is going to beat Q1 expectations \n2) Humans are habitual\n3) I\u2019m a big fan of cloud services across the board\n4) I\u2019ll be an Amazon prime member till the day I die\n\n**Let me explain**\n\n1) Amazon has beat expectations for the last four years in Q1. I\u2019m aware people are expecting Amazon to report good numbers tomorrow but I\u2019m in the camp they are going to take off like a \ud83d\ude80 . I for sure have bought more from Amazon than I ever have this quarter.\n\n2) Humans are habitual in nature. If you think people are going to stop ordering as much as they are, you\u2019re wrong! Amazon has a subscribe feature for a reason. When you buy something you have the option to subscribe and save 10-15% (depending on the item of course)... genius!\n\n3) The cloud is the future. Companies and individuals are using cloud services more and more. I don\u2019t expect this trend to stop or the growth to slow down. I\u2019m putting my money where my mouth is on this one. I haven\u2019t done a recent calculation but about 50% of my portfolio is made up of the following companies: Google, Microsoft, Amazon and SMH (semiconductor ETF).\n\n4) I love Amazon Prime. I\u2019m writing this post about  to pass out while I\u2019m watching Parks and Recreation on Amazon video. I ordered this cool Brazilian soda called Guarana off Amazon last week for my brother and I. It\u2019s a really unique taste and I\u2019d highly recommend it! I don\u2019t even drink soda but this shit is amazing.\n\nWishing you all the best during a difficult time for many!", "created_utc": 1588229638.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gaqr55/i_bought_amazon_yesterday/", "is_self": true}
