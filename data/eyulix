Just look back at when Elon smoked a blunt on the Joe Rogan podcast back in Sept \u201818. \n\nShares dropped 9 percent with staff quitting, federal investigations, and lawsuits. \n\nWith the current growth of $TSLA, I imagine that is not the only thing that will be \u2018too high.\u2019 \n\nThe party will be hosted just in time and early enough behind the Q1 earnings to get those shorts in good.\n\nJust think about all those people that have lost a good fortune trying to short $TSLA. If there\u2019s a vulnerable spot for Mr. Musk, this will be it.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?", "created_utc": 1580841196, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eyulix/for_those_trying_to_short_tsla_read_this/", "is_self": true}
