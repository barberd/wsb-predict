I\u2019m your host and resident autist u/expander2. You have to be able to read to gain anything from this so that rules out about half of you. As always, ticker is in bold on the left and what I deem \"important\" is near the top of the post. A TLDR, plays, and previous DD summaries will be at the bottom. My last posts still stand and hold some good info so check it out for more plays if this isn't enough for you greedy fucks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have seen a lot of predictions of where the market is headed in the future. Most of them have been complete shit written by idiots that don\u2019t even know that you can exercise an option. There have also been a few that have got me thinking. What is the most reasonable thing that will happen in the coming months? Now I\u2019m not writing all of this myself. I am combining the thoughts of many people and my own so do not take this as the gospel. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Markets Future;** The most likely thing to happen is that whenever we, as a nation, reopen there will be a large rise and then a second drop once everyone realizes the destruction that shutting the economy down has caused. The reopening of everything will act as a shot of adrenaline. People will come out of their homes in droves to go to the places they loved before the pandemic. These people will be on their way to businesses that are no longer open. Half of small businesses only have enough money on hand to last 27 days in the event of no cash flow. This is in the event of them being open and paying employees so we can stretch it out a little bit but they still have to pay utilities and rent. According to these figures, most small businesses can only last, at most, around two months. As we approach the third month of shutdown we can be sure that a good portion of America's small businesses will not survive. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur small businesses make up 45% of US GDP. If even 25% of small businesses close that would translate to a loss of 2.3 trillion dollars. When people realize that the businesses they relied on are all closed, mass exodus of the stock market will ensue. People do not want to invest when they fear not being able to make their next rent payment, or God forbid their cell phone gets shut off. Humans are emotional creatures. Fear will override any sentiment pushed by the government. They can say that they are bailing out companies, forgiving debt nationwide, and giving out free blowjobs but nothing will stop a recession with small businesses shutting down nationwide. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo here is what I believe will happen. The market will continue to go up. We may not hit the highs we saw before the drop but we will get up there. It will rise because people see that the virus is slowing, we are beating it. Then we will open, and within a month we will drop and that will be the beginning of a recession. Again, do not take this as gospel. This is just what seems most likely. Calls still work and will work until a date is confirmed that we will open. Puts will work on individual companies but not market wide like they did in early March. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is not the type of write up I usually do but good DD was scarce this weekend. The remaining DD I have will be short but a worthwhile read. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**WING;** Wingstop is one of the few plays for this post that looks decent. Their revenue has been rising however their net profit has been declining exponentially because of growing interest on their loans which went up from 5M to 17M in two years. They only have around 74M in assets which is more than 5 times less than what they are liable for. Their only growth strategy is to open more stores, the CEO dropped 36,000 shares, and no shares have been bought by executives in the last 12 months. These figures should be enough to tell you that Wingstop will go down. The next question is when and I can not tell you that for certain. If you want to buy in now, buy long puts for next quarter (June/July). I, myself, am going to wait a couple months and watch it develop so save this post so that you'll remember. [Read this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7z3qq/the_dumpster_fire_that_is_wingstop/) for more information.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**HTHT;** Huazhu is a hotel company based in China. Puts on hotels are not really a monumental discovery but something about this has caught my eye. This is a play that I am skeptical of myself but [read this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7yq8r/calling_all_autistic_investors_htht_puts/) and come to your own conclusions. I do intend to buy a few $25p 5/15 just because they are cheap and the volume is immense. It mirrors what happened with LK in a scary way. 17,000 put options at $25p 5/15 were bought on April 22 for this ticker. The post that got me interested goes into much more detail about why they are likely to sink from their price now ($30.56) to below $25 so if this peaks your interest too then I recommend reading it and deciding for yourself. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SNAP;** There is a much better write up [right here for more information](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g8zme2/lets_talk_snap/) but I will summarize it here. Snapchat is not making much on ads and the advertising industry gets fucked during an economic downturn. Their expenditures scale with the amount of users active and because of the shutdown use is up, while the ads are going to go down. The bull in me says, \u201cIts Snapchat, it'll be fine\u201d, but the bear in me says, \u201cCompanies which derive most of their revenue from ads will do well in a downturn.\u201d Take what you wish. I am staying out of this one as it's hard to call which way it will go. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck fuckers and tune in on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for more WSB DD Summaries!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR;** Economy open= Market down, Wingstop is a shitshow, Huazhu is sketchy, and Snapchat is a gamble. Read previous posts for more plays that are still viable and can make you money since this one was a little sparse.\n\n**Plays;** Watch for a confirmed open date and then buy puts, WING puts for June/July, HTHT puts at $25 for 5/15, SNAP puts maybe for late May/June.\n\n**Previous WSB DD Summaries;**[ 4/16-4/20](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g50ip3/dd_from_416420_dis_shop_and_bear_porn_tldr_and/), [4/21-4/22](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g68ny9/dd_from_421422_activision_tyson_square_and_gains/), [4/23-4/24](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7f1m6/dd_from_423424_live_nation_oil_starbucks_and/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDISCLAIMER; I am not personally advocating for any play that I add to this list.
