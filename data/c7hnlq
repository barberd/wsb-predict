Last night, I got out my OUIJA board and asked for the play of the week. The board spelled out N-K-E, then the numbers 9-0. I didn't even have to ask for an expiration, the board chose 7-1-9-2-0-1-9.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInverse Head and Shoulders pattern on NKE almost confirmed. Will be sacrificing a goat tonight and watching price at open for validation. Calls incoming. If chart voodoo is correct, entry point at $86, target $90 (maybe by 7/19), stop loss $83.", "created_utc": 1561918627, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c7hnlq/chart_voodoo_and_dark_rituals/", "is_self": true}
