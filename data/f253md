{"id": "f253md", "title": "SPCE calls are retarded", "selftext": "I ran into something called warrant the other day, applied all my autistic brain matter to understand it, and can't stop wondering why people are still buying calls? \n\nWarrants are the same as options. You can buy put or call warrant which works like options, except they are so much better. Let me apply some autistic level of mathematics to explain why:\n\nAs of today, meme stock $SPCE closed at 20.55.\n\nThe $11.5 call warrant expiring 2024 Oct 25 closed at $8.98. They are ITM 20.55 - 11.5 = $9.05. And they cost $8.98. Wait. The premium for the 5-year calls is negative 7 cents? Either I am brain dead or dreaming. How can you buy something with negative premium? You literally get paid to hold FD for 5 years, 7 cents per contract. Literally free money. \n\nLet's look at the furthest calls at nearest strike: 12.5C epxr 2022 Jan 21. The call option cost $10.20 (midpoint) and is 20.55 - 12.5 = $8.05 in the money. The premium per share is 10.2 - 8.05 = $2.05. Which is still cheap, but no where near as good as warrant.\n\nAnd don't forget that I'm comparing a 5-year warrant (1718 days) with a 2 year option (710 days).\n\nAs for theta, today my $SPCE is up $1.88 each piece. My warrant is up $1.83 each piece. Delta \\~= 0.97. The 12.5C option has 0.86 delta. To get &gt; 0.95 delta you have to get down to the $7.5 strike. \n\nIn addition, by buying warrant you enjoy the moral superiority of investing your cash in the company instead of betting against some random artists. Sir Branson will use your $$ to serve humanity.\n\nWarrant is the way.", "created_utc": 1581406618, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f253md/spce_calls_are_retarded/", "is_self": true}
