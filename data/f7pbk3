{"id": "f7pbk3", "title": "Zillow Research", "selftext": "Hey, guys thought I'd drop a little DD into Zillow. I have been trying to figure out why it is so steady in growth recently. Zillow expanded its business to house flipping and expects to add 20 Billion in revenue. Zillow also provides seller leads for users of its Premier Agent program and brokerage partners. Real estate agents can also purchase advertising with Zillow. Real estate agents will pay Zillow based on the number of ad impressions delivered to users. Mortgage lenders pay Zillow based on cost per click. Seems like a good business model and Zillow could become the AMZN of the real estate game if they can follow through on this.", "created_utc": 1582356190, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7pbk3/zillow_research/", "is_self": true}
