{"id": "gdp1tn", "title": "IWM Put Hedge?", "selftext": "I put together a mid 5 figure portfolio of LEAP options in various large oil companies & ETFs (XLE, USL) two weeks ago for early 2022. Plus a few others like LUV today ($32.5 Strike), RTX in early April.\n\nTo protect my recent gains (120% in BNO, 76% in PSX, -10% in RDS.A, -9% in USL), I opened an August 21 IWM put for $123 equal to 5% of my portfolio.  Idea is while WTI and IWM are heavily correlated, IWM has greater downside than oil majors (bankruptcy-facing shale is another matter). \n\nAny better suggestions to hedge a bottom feeder portfolio against a potential market-wide drop? \n\nI'd hate to take such a big hit in August if the market does move to a higher range.", "created_utc": 1588644079.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gdp1tn/iwm_put_hedge/", "is_self": true}
