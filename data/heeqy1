Imo we will see an interesting day today because CRSP will probably break it's ATH on positive news ([https://crisprtx.gcs-web.com/static-files/a4025a52-eb19-4cd7-9059-a5e3a09de119](https://crisprtx.gcs-web.com/static-files/a4025a52-eb19-4cd7-9059-a5e3a09de119)). Usually the crispr stocks move in unison and I wonder how the other stocks might react to this. People are expecting positive news on EDIT-101 soon (Cure for LCA) and NTLA did a share offering at 32USD'sh to Regeneron recently (current market price 22.78USD). I have a feeling we are reaching a tipping point in the industry with lots of good data and news coming out. We might leave these prices behind us, thoughts?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9xs4nz8qxn651.png?width=1767&format=png&auto=webp&s=c431d005e0f6cb752757afd65af3f989a013f687\n\nEDIT: Long on all four", "created_utc": 1592919436.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/heeqy1/crispr_a_rising_tide_lifts_all_boats/", "is_self": true}
