However, immediately after, we saw a meteoric bounce back up, since fb is pretty well positioned for future growth in AI, AR, VR, and social media ads, and none of those events alone really warranted that crash. \n\n\nWith this in mind, my question is, when events produce a correlated downtrend or uptrend, doesn't that almost always require a correction in the opposite direction to decorrelate the trends? \n\n\nIn other words, if event1 is combined with event2 and they're both in the bearish direction, it'll produce a combined effect greater than the intrinsic effects of the two separately, and as a result, that added combo effect will eventually be corrected (most likely, immediately after the downtrend has ended)\n\n\n\nAnyone get burned by examples where this didnt play out like fb?", "created_utc": 1593657815.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hjourx/do_correlated_trends_produce_alpha/", "is_self": true}
