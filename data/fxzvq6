I was a smart autist for the longest time until Kohl's came into my life and then it raped my family and killed my dog. Here you can see my beautiful, yet tiny, gains. All of which, crushed by the conglomerate that is Kohl's never again will I bet against them. The saddest part? I had KSS $14P 4/9 that I sold at a $800+ loss last week, only for KSS to drop to around $11 this week. They would have  been itm but instead Kohl's long dicked me and I have made it my mission to personally see the bankruptcy of this company. If anyone would like to join me on this crusade, get on the short bus, it's going to be a wild ride.\n\n[My poor tendies](https://imgur.com/a/HLUcF2w)\n\nTLDR: Fuck Kohl's- KSS $13P 4/17 (Yes, I bought more Kohl's puts. I won't let Satan win.)", "created_utc": 1586463689.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxzvq6/thesis_kohls_is_satanic/", "is_self": true}
