It's Casey and Eshaan from RCR biotech, we're a medical student and neurobiology/business school student that helps try to identify biotech companies/drugs we find potentially lucrative, and explain the mechanism, logistics, etc. as simply as possible. Last week we posted asking for companies you wanted DD on. We're still going through the comments and selecting a few that we like. In the process, we stumbled upon an antibiotic &amp; company we really liked, and wanted to share that information with you. Below is our newest blog post.\n\n**TLDR- Summary &amp; Thoughts**\n\nIn summary, Baxdela (Melinta Therapeutics; MLNT) is an FDA-approved drug for skin infection that has a PDUFA date on October 24th for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia.\u00a0 Baxdela comes from a class of antibiotics (fluoroquinolones) that is used frequently to treat pneumonia.\u00a0 However, its unique chemical structure makes it more potent at sites of infection compared to other antibiotics in its family. \u00a0Previous Phase 3 trials show non-inferiority (which is good) compared to expensive, \u201cbig gun\u201d antibiotics in the treatment of skin infections.\u00a0 Additionally, those clinical trials also suggest Baxdela is fairly well-tolerated by patients.\u00a0 In turn, this drug represents a novel antibiotic in the time of rising rates of antibiotic-resistant bacteria for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (which causes \\~$84billion/year of health care charges). While we got in the game a bit late (\\~$3.89/share), we still think Melinta Therapeutics (MLNT) will continue to rise up to- and after the PDUFA date on October 24th.\u00a0\n\n\\*\\*\\*Disclaimer- we own a whopping \\~$23 worth of MLNT shares, so do with that information what you will\\*\\*\\* (residency applications were expensive lol)\n\n**FULL POST**\n\n**What it is**\u2013\n\nBaxdela (Delafloxacin) is a novel fluoroquinolone antibiotic produced by Melinta Therapeutics (MLNT). Fluoroquinolones are one several different types of antibiotics, including:\n\n1. Sulfonamides\n2. Beta-lactams (ie. penicillin, ampicillin)\n3. Tetracylins (ie. doxycycline)\n4. Macrolides\n5. Aminoglycosides\n6. Fluoroquinolones\n\nEach class of antibiotic is effective against different combinations of strains of bacteria.\u00a0 While the specifics of bacterial coverage are out of context of this post, Baxdela has VERY wide coverage of bacteria, including gram positives, gram negatives, MRSA, anaerobic, and intracellular bacteria.\n\n**Why we like it-**\n\nIn the age of antibiotic resistance, it\u2019s been difficult to 1.create new drugs and 2. get them through the FDA pipeline.\u00a0 It previously gained FDA approval for the treatment of soft-tissue infections, and now is being evaluated for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).\u00a0 CAP is an infection of the lungs from bacteria encountered through everyday life (compared to hospital-acquired pneumonia which tend to be different strains of bacteria).\u00a0 CAP is one of the most common reasons for hospitalization, causing all sorts of problems, including death.\u00a0 In 2014, pneumonia caused $84 billion dollar in health care-related charges.\u00a0 MRSA is a common cause of pneumonia (although not #1), and having an arsenal of different drugs with efficacy against this antibiotic-resistant strain of bacteria is becoming more and more important.\n\nWhile it comes from the fluoroquinolone family, it has a unique chemical structure that makes it more potent in acidic environments (like sites of infection) compared to other fluoroquinolones.\u00a0 In two different Phase 3 trials, Baxdela reached non-inferiority against two \u201cbig gun\u201d drugs (Vancomycin and Aztreonam) in treatment of MRSA skin infections.\u00a0 Additionally, in the PROCEED Phase 3 clinical trial, the incidence of adverse effects causing discontinuation was lower in Baxdela (0.9%) compared to Vanc/Azt (4.3%).\u00a0\n\n**Melinta Therapeutics Logistics-**\n\nMLNT does not have that long a history of financials available, but what has been released since the company went public shows a promising company with increasing revenues and gross margins (GM increased \\~10.5% between 2018 and trailing twelve months (TTM)), and shifting expenses from R&amp;D to SG&amp;A, indicating a company ready to pivot from therapeutic discovery to marketing a promising drug. Additionally, net income has increased between 2018 and TTM, which for an early stage pharmaceutical company is a good sign that the heavy R&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses that have been incurred may be leading to some early returns.\n\n**Summary &amp; Thoughts**\n\nIn summary, Baxdela (Melinta Therapeutics; MLNT) is an FDA-approved drug for skin infection that has a PDUFA date on October 24th for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia.\u00a0 Baxdela comes from a class of antibiotics (fluoroquinolones) that is used frequently to treat pneumonia.\u00a0 However, it\u2019s unique chemical structure makes it more potent at sites of infection compared to other antibiotics in its family. \u00a0Previous Phase 3 trials show non-inferiority compared to expensive, \u201cbig gun\u201d antibiotics in the treatment of skin infections.\u00a0 Additionally, those clinical trials also suggest Baxdela is fairly well-tolerated by patients.\u00a0 In turn, this drug represents a novel antibiotic in the time of rising rates of antibiotic resistant bacteria for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (which causes \\~$84billion/year of health care charges). While we got in the game a bit late (\\~$3.89/share), we still think Melinta Therapeutics (MLNT) will continue to rise up to and after the PDUFA date on October 24th.\u00a0\n\n**Plan**\n\nWe think the overall future of Melinta is bright, but we plan to hold this company for the short-term for now.\u00a0 We bought in at \\~$3.89/ share.\u00a0 Specifically, we plan to sell 25%-50% of shares on Wednesday, October 23rd before the PDUFA date, then (pending good news) likely sell the rest a few days later.", "created_utc": 1571273593, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/diysry/baxdela_delafloxacin_from_melinta_therapeutics/", "is_self": true}
