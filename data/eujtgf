{"id": "eujtgf", "title": "5 Years Since Virgin Galactic Crash", "selftext": "Just want to remind you retards and autistic folk about the dangers of space travel and one of the reasons why SpaceX is not a public company, *yet*.\n\nI am long SPCE and have stock + calls in with them and have already made a nice profit from it's sky-rocketing performance thus far.\n\nI want to offer a little grounding, humbleness and acknowledgement that this shit can kill on a whim.\n\nThis post is in memoriam for Michael Asbury, the first and hopefully last casualty of the Virgin Galactic space program. He lost his life more than 5 years ago in a tragic test flight crash in the Mohave desert.\n\nHis name will live on, engraved in the Space Mirror Memorial at Kennedy Space Center, alongside astronauts from the Apolo, Challenger and Columbia programs who gave their lives for this country, in pursuit of one of the noblest ambitions of the modern era.\n\n&gt; Taber MacCallum, chairman of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, hailed Alsbury as \"a hero of our generation: a commercial astronaut test pilot.\"\n\n&gt; \"Routine, safe spaceflight is unbelievably challenging\u00a0\u2014 but so, too, was routine, safe air travel not so long ago,\"\u00a0MacCallum told the crowd.\u00a0\n\nhttps://www.floridatoday.com/story/news/2020/01/25/fallen-virgin-galactic-test-pilot-remembered-space-mirror-memorial/4562611002/\n\nMr. MacCallum's words are true and echo the opportunity and dangers of our investment in Virgin Galactic. Let us not take for granted the money to be made. \n\nLet us appreciate the sacrifice people like pilot Michael Asbury have made for us as a society and the opportunity afforded to us, to be able to buy and bet on a piece of this historic company's success.\n\nThat being said, let's make some fucking mooonaahhy! SPCE to the god damn moon boys!", "created_utc": 1580104886, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eujtgf/5_years_since_virgin_galactic_crash/", "is_self": true}
