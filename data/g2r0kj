This year, I went from 156k (start) to 195k at the top 2 weeks ago, today at the EOD 144k.  Tomorrow I'm expecting a hit of at least 10k. Below are my index put positions (all but one red, although some only slightly):\n\n2x  IWM Jun 19 2020 100.00 Put  \n2x  IWM Jul 17 2020 110.00 Put\n\n  \n5x  SPY Apr 17 2020 290.00 Call  \n\n\n6x  SPY May 15 2020 180.00 Put  \n8x  SPY May 15 2020 200.00 Put  \n8x  SPY Jun 30 2020 200.00 Put  \n3x  SPY May 15 2020 220.00 Put  \n8x  SPY Jun 30 2020 220.00 Put  \n3x  SPY Jun 30 2020 230.00 Put  \n1x  SPY Jun 19 2020 240.00 Put  \n5x  SPY Sep 18 2020 240.00 Put  \n11x SPY Sep 18 2020 250.00 Put  \n1x  SPY Jul 17 2020 275.00 Put  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso I have 300x WYNN and 300x LYV short stock positions that are poised to really fuck me over tomorrow based on AH. Also have some other small positions that are all but done and are inconsequential. \n\nif you are wondering about the still high balance of 144k I still have a lot of cash in the account, about 90k in option buying power at the moment.\n\nI felt like I was finally getting somewhere these past 2 days and was hoping to at least recover to my starting position of 156k. Seeing the AH action just broke me and now I feel hopeless. Any advice on how to salvage the situation at least a little bit? Feeling like $ROPE (not being serious, don't send me to suicide hotline please). I'm realizing I may not be cut out for this. This is quite a bit of money for me that I'm losing and it's really getting to me.\n\nWhat would you do in my situation?", "created_utc": 1587082103.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2r0kj/need_some_advice_on_how_to_salvage_my_bearish/", "is_self": true}
