{"id": "eu8008", "title": "A high potential public weed company you've never heard of- Cansortium (CNTMF)", "selftext": "I\u2019ve been following Cansortium (CNTMF) since it acquired full interest in Knox Medical/Fluent in August 2018. The strategy behind the Fluent acquisition and expansion was to vertically integrate the company\u2019s supply chain. It\u2019s the second largest cannabis producer in Florida behind Trulieve.\n\nI wanted to do a bit of a deep dive on the financials. I used the 2019 Q3 statements at the link below:\n\n[https://investors.getfluent.com/static-files/6b23707d-1094-4f59-8ec6-bb27fd6682e2](https://investors.getfluent.com/static-files/6b23707d-1094-4f59-8ec6-bb27fd6682e2)\n\nThe company\u2019s financials are interesting. It\u2019s difficult to compare results across periods because the financial statements seem to skewed by many nonrecurring items. Some examples include:\n\n\\- A gain on fair market value of investment in associates of $31 million in 2018 (larger than the net income in 2018) but only about a $3 million gain in 2019\n\n\\- Convertible debt issuance in 2019 substantially improves the cash position\n\n\\- Proceeds from the equity offering in 2019 but not 2018\n\n\\- Significant debt payments in 2019\n\nAfter reformulating the financial statements (I\u2019d be happy to explain more in depth if you\u2019d like), I think the company is primed to outperform.\n\nFirst, like most cannabis companies, the company\u2019s sales are skyrocketing along with costs. But for Cansortium, I wanted to break down why expenses were creeping so much higher than revenue. Broken down in note 14, legal and professional fees make up slightly less than half of G&amp;A. Considering the regulation surrounding the industry, it\u2019s not surprising that legal fees make up such a high portion of expenses ($11.2 million in the first 9 months of 2019). In the last earnings call, CEO Jose Hidalgo mentioned that they expect legal fees to decrease significantly as part of the company\u2019s cost-cutting strategy. It\u2019s such a big deal especially considering the revenue in the first 9 months of the year was $19 million. Almost 60% of revenue was eaten up by legal fees. That\u2019s going to decline and give some help to margins.\n\nSecond, after the IPO and debt issuance activities, it looks to me like the worst of the company\u2019s financial problems are over. Since the CNTMF went public in April, the stock price is down 76% because of aggressive financing activity and fears of not meeting debt covenants. In 2019, more than $51 million was due in total notes payable (from note 11). Management handled this relatively well by making 3 new financing agreements over the course of the last year and paid off the entirety of the Knox/Fluent acquisition. The strategy has also served to extend out the company\u2019s payments. From September 30, 2019, $8.9 million of debt is current. The use of convertible debt to raise $26 million in 2019 is risky because it could lead to more dilution. In December the board decided to sell non-core assets in Canada and Puerto Rico, with more non-core sales coming. My guess is that with capital markets drying up, Cansortium decided to find cash outside of financing activity last quarter. Similarly to how I tested Aurora\u2019s liquidity risk, I think the asset coverage ratio is a good way to assess the balance sheet strength of such a capital intensive business. The coverage ratio is 3.45. That\u2019s at the top of the peer set and significantly above the peer set average of 1.15.\n\n[https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/cansortium-restructures-approximately-25-0-million-of-near-term-obligations-significantly-improving-balance-sheet-and-available-free-cash-flow-to-fund-growth-848755925.html](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/cansortium-restructures-approximately-25-0-million-of-near-term-obligations-significantly-improving-balance-sheet-and-available-free-cash-flow-to-fund-growth-848755925.html)\n\nThird, the company has a great brand and a strong presence in Florida. Fluent is well positioned because its concentrates, syringes, and flower all considered top of the line product. Compared to Trulieve, prices are on average 20 to 30% higher. For instance, the whole flower pricing for tier 3 (19 to 22.9% THC) is $45 per eighth. Trulieve\u2019s tier 3 price is $35. As was explained by Hidalgo on the last earnings call, the company\u2019s strategy is to not compete with Trulieve on price and instead to focus on better quality, higher price, and improved margin strains and products. I think this has been particularly successful. Users on multiple cannabis discussion forums have called the Fluent Black line the \u201cbest in Florida\u201d and \u201csome of the most potent cartridges on the market.\u201d One of my concerns about the pricing plan is the way discounts are used. On January 2 the company announced a new loyalty/discount program intending to encourage higher sales. With discounts of about 25% off for new dispensary openings, repeat customers, and birthdays, the new program seems incongruent to the company\u2019s strategy to me. The focus on quality and higher priced products doesn\u2019t make sense if discounts are needed to increase traffic. If I had a call with management, I\u2019d ask about this topic.\n\nOverall, the company is financially well positioned and branded for success. Like most cannabis companies, the growth narrative is that once the debt issues can be overcome and the supply disruptions (both gluts and shortages) are solved, profitability will easily be achieved. Fortunately, this seems achievable for CNTMF. Once legal costs go down and better liability management for the Knox/Fluent acquisition is practiced, I\u2019ll feel even better about the opportunity.", "created_utc": 1580052362, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eu8008/a_high_potential_public_weed_company_youve_never/", "is_self": true}
