On the day of his inauguration\u2014in fact, 20 minutes after he concluded his inaugural address\u2014the Islamic Republic of Iran announced the release of the hostages. The timing gave rise to an allegation that representatives of Reagan's presidential campaign had conspired with Iran to delay the release until after the election to thwart President Carter from pulling off an \"October surprise\".\n\nAccording to the allegation, the Reagan Administration rewarded Iran for its participation in the plot by supplying Iran with weapons via Israel and by unblocking Iranian government monetary assets in US banks.", "created_utc": 1558884621, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bt97fm/i_got_some_sick_dd_about_the_chinese_trade_deal/", "is_self": true}
