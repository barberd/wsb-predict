So all you r/all cucks can go suck it when \"you don't get it\" or use the virality of the posts to get upvotes on your bullshit political agendas. (End mini rant)\n\nI'm thankful to get to walk the sub of legends such as u/1r0nyman, u/analfarmer2, u/controlthenarrative. I'm even more thankful that u/woodc93, in his quest to achieve peak autism, leveled his autism up to such an amazing degree that he brought them all back from the dead to show love and pay respect to a fellow autist actually achieving a peak autism beyond peak autism.\n\nI'm thankful that they're all alive and well IRL and are just lurking and waiting to welcome the next autist into the r/wallstreetbets HoF.\n\nBut lastly, I'm thankful to the gayest mods on Reddit for continuing to nurture and uphold the awesomeness and wholesomeness of all that is this sub, and always blocking my posts, but giving me this bitching flair, and letting a tiny pp acct, but yuge IRL YOLOer, a place on the internet to hang with probably the only people in the world who actually \"get it\".\n\n\nHappy \ud83e\udd83\ud83e\udd83 Day bitches.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nA.
