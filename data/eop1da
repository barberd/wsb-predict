Have also checked back over the last week and all the meme stonks (apart from fkn AMD) do would have produced good gains. \n\nWith earnings season coming up, with the markets in complete euphoria, people cannot help just YOLO-ing at open on anything they hear some good news about. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo get those sweet tenderinos all you gotta do is track a stonk which has already got a pre-market boost from earnings report. If you're like me you have access to CFDs from PM to AH trading. Long it shortly before open (shortly before so that you can reduce risk of it getting priced in), and then dump within the first 5 mins. \n\nYou'll miss some of the risk of making a play before reports come out and so not . You'll also get out before it dumps in the first few mins. You'll gain that sweet ride up as everyone buys the shit out of the stock at open. Rinse and repeat. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLiterally cannot go tits up: confirmed", "created_utc": 1579025877, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eop1da/all_my_uk_idiots_with_limited_options_access_see/", "is_self": true}
