{"id": "cbxgad", "title": "Anyone heard this about Boeing announcing the end game for BA?", "selftext": "Someone I know was way up high, attended a meeting showing Airbus clearly as the winner if Boeing did not meet sales orders of a certain level by 2015. They predicted that Airbus and their capital reserves from heavier orders would clash with Boeing's retiring workforce of working millionaires in their 60s. By 2016, a significant year for Boeing, the truth would be known and those that listened are now gone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDecades of manufacturing skills now left to new people to learn from scratch on 737 MAX and soon the fateful 787 as it melts away in plastic history. Apparently, Europe offers free education for aerospace skills and they produce a robust workforce. I heard that from the applicant. At 22 and from France, he had more floor experience than anyone I ever interviewed that young. He was interested in living the USA on one of the 1.2 million allowed to work in the USA by Congress each year on work visas for lacking American skills.", "created_utc": 1562861356, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cbxgad/anyone_heard_this_about_boeing_announcing_the_end/", "is_self": true}
