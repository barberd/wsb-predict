{"id": "g55usm", "title": "PSA: Buying calls or puts is not buying \"Naked\"", "selftext": "I must have seen 3 or 4 posts in the last 48 hours about \"DD\" that references the term \"Naked\".\n\nThe ONLY appropriate use of the term \"Naked\" is when you write an unsecured (Read: do not own underlying shares) call.\n\nThat's it. Full stop.\n\nWant to buy a TSLA 1000c? Great you just bought a call. Not \"bought a naked call\" just buying a call.\n\nWant to write a put? Awesome! This is also NOT a \"Naked\" put. Writing a put always has to be cash secured or margin secured. That's it. It's not naked.\n\nTLDR : Naked options only refer to the act of WRITING a call without the underlying shares. Own the underlying shares? Cool you're \"covered\". Don't own the underlying shares? You're \"naked\". \n\nStop making yourselves look stupid by using incorrect terminology in your \"DD\".\n\nOr do.
