{"id": "f0io4c", "title": "I think I might be retarded?", "selftext": "Everyone in here is always posting about how you\u2019d have to be retarded not to make money in this market, but I keep losing money on what I considered to be unfortunate trades, because I might be retarded. Most notably it was PCG, lost half my money when the entire state of California caught on fire, and I sold the exact second they announced they may file for bankruptcy. Most recently was Disney, beat all expectations, somehow went down. But I\u2019m holding long term because I refuse to lose money again. What am I missing that you guys all seem to know? Would be open to any advice whatsoever, but please don\u2019t just name stocks to invest in, unless you can also provide the reasoning.
