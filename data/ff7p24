Currently it's at 2.32$. **Their all time highest reached at 17.68$ in 2015-2016 from approval of the ZIKA virus news**. They have history of approval with CDC.\n\n* I believe there's a possibility for a small growth this upcoming week if everything goes well with OPK and still a bit early to get in as the price dropped on Friday, which I bought in at 2.60$, but I believe this will not trend downwards this coming up week.\n\n* Let me know on your thoughts on OPK\n\nReferences:\n\n[Biotech Forum Daily Digest: OPKO Gets Early FDA Approval, Zika Virus Again In The News, Spotlight On XBiotech](https://seekingalpha.com/article/3983609-biotech-forum-daily-digest-opko-gets-early-fda-approval-zika-virus-again-in-news-spotlight-on)\n\n[Stock Market Wrap-Up: Coronavirus Hopes Lift Inovio, OPKO](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stock-market-wrap-up%3A-coronavirus-hopes-lift-inovio-opko-2020-03-06)\n\n[Trump Visits CDC After Coronavirus Fears Throw Schedule Into Chaos](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/06/812825943/trump-signs-coronavirus-funding-bill-cancels-trip-to-cdc)\n\n[Opko Health Announces It Will Offer Coronavirus Test](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/opko-health-coronavirus-test)\n\nMy Positions:\n\nShort Term for next week news - OPK 3$ call 03/13\n\nMid term to play it safe - OPK 3$ call 04/03", "created_utc": 1583642983, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ff7p24/opk_3_calls_0313_and_0413_next_week_news/", "is_self": true}
