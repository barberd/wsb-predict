Much like  the feudal barons, they hire mercenaries (lawyers and investment  bankers) to deal with these peasants (stockholders), if they become too  unruly.***\u00a0 *The recent Occidental Petroleum fiasco is a great example of  how CEOs and boards will go to great lengths, including \u201cbetting the  company\u201d to serve their own agendas.\u00a0 If their bet is successful, they  and possibly their shareholders win, but if it is unsuccessful, only the  shareholders lose.\u00a0 Too many boards like Occidental\u2019s believe they are  unaccountable and cannot be removed, and therefore can do almost  anything they please.\u00a0 This attitude is a major threat to the value of  America\u2019s companies, the stockholders of which are many middle Americans  who have more of their savings invested in stocks than ever before.\"*", "created_utc": 1561402195, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c4td41/carl_icahn_gives_me_a_boner_czr_to_14_by_end_of/", "is_self": true}
