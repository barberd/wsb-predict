{"id": "gbafd2", "title": "Oil Tanker Storage Play Update", "selftext": "Feels like not enough real info to be a DD, but some notes on the current oil tanker storage plays. Not financial advice. Remember: I am an idiot. **TL,DR: the bull case around earnings remains strong in the short-term (30 days) which is all I care about.**\n\nReading a lot of oil tanker trader feeds (OOTT). Info from the ones with actual jobs in the industry...\n\nBULL case:\n\n* the absolute crazy spot rates for tankers ($200K+) are currently gone, **but**\n* tanker storage rates are often still at multiples of normal rates on spot market, and at least strongly \"elevated\"\n* long-term contract rates are at very high, well-above \"normal\" prices\n* the \"lower\" storage adds are because there's truly little room in Cushing (the \"empty\" space is for refining needs, and the rest is contracted)\n* The storage issue is now global\n* top names are trading around Feb stock prices, as if market expected somewhat typical (but good) year, after sell-off\n\nBEAR case\n\n* the contango curve is dropping hard/gone for the moment with the rise in WTI\n* US govt says they'll store hundreds of millions of barrels for US producers in strategic reserve\n* Noobs out of USO after reverse split + USO changing to \"we can buy *any* type of oil contract\" pulled a shit ton of pressure on WTI rates\n* OPEC+ cuts start now, will have a strong effect\n* US cuts (and others) are already in effect\n* POTUS punched Saudi Arabia in the face, and threatened regime change and complete Middle Eastern destabilization without cuts, which came immediately\n\nBULL response (whoops):\n\n* It's middle month, there's a likely huge drop in WTI prices coming again as we near May 21 settlement\n* Production cuts today drive future price cuts, pressure rates for immediate contracts, little effect on oil already in holds\n* Russia cheats on cuts all the time. Other countries may join them\n* The storage space for hundreds of millions of barrels of oil in the strategic reserve is a fantasy (unless the Jones Act is suspended, meaning taker calls print, or oil in the ground is counted as \"reserve\" and the US govt pays for future production...which feels insane, but no less insane than any other economic decision by the USA these days)\n\nTwitters I'm reading: just #OOTT and you get a lot of info. The wheat from the chaff I'm using are\n\n* [https://twitter.com/TankersInt](https://twitter.com/TankersInt) (actual handshake/confirmed contract rates)\n* [https://twitter.com/chigrl](https://twitter.com/chigrl)\n* [https://twitter.com/JHannisdahl](https://twitter.com/JHannisdahl)\n* [https://twitter.com/calvinfroedge](https://twitter.com/calvinfroedge) (he showed up here and called the NAT top perfectly)\n* [https://twitter.com/Samir\\_Madani](https://twitter.com/Samir_Madani), who helped start -\n* [https://twitter.com/TankerTrackers](https://twitter.com/TankerTrackers) (I grabbed premium sub, but haven't asked for info on particular tanker company fleets from today's report on oil storage yet)\n\nI took the advice of smarter people, and sold my NAT calls all for profit (50% - 200+%). I am holding several others still, and further dips would make me load more. I definitely will buy STNG calls at this price because it's back to near \"yawn\"-type year levels. Since it's the first, if it reports blockbuster numbers everybody reacts to them. But not only am I an idiot, I have no real knowledge of the tanker market and am only looking at short term trades. I'll be out by mid-May if 2020 is merely great, and out by June or Oct if guidance is \"holy shit we're using tendies as cum rags\" excellent.\n\nPositions: May EURN $12.50c, $17.50c lotto, June FRO $17c, $18c  lottos, TNP $5c and willing to double down on non-lottos but not YOLO.
