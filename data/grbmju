{"id": "grbmju", "title": "$GME Long Calls Potential", "selftext": "Hello fellow autists, I'm here today to get some smarter people than me discussing something I see potential in. I'm talking about the company everyone loves to hate, GameStop. I'm pretty new to trading, so I don't have the DD skills of someone who has been here for years, but I do know video games as I collect them pretty heavily.\n\n**Research?**  \n\nI sell as well, and I have noticed an insane uptick in costs of games, eBay and local sites have been flooded in the past 2 months with people buying games, as such prices have risen tremendously. Well, do I have any data to back that up? Fuck yes I do, I created a shitty python file about 6 months ago that tracked the prices of games for a given day for about 25 consoles. You can find that here: https://github.com/Cokeroft/pricecharting\n\nThe important jist is in the prices folder, find any console you want and look at some prices from pre covid and now. Most notable increases are in Wii, N64, and Gamecube those have been flying off the shelves. If you are able to run it, feel free but you can use the get_any_csv.py file and you can compare, I've done that and here are some examples (CIB) from 120 days ago:\n\nAnimal Crossing City Folk $9.99 -> $27.51  \nSuper Mario Galaxy $11.57 -> $18.91  \nSuper Paper Mario $10 -> $19.83  \nZelda Skyward Sword $23.77 -> $38.37  \n\n**Used Game Sales**  \n\nThese are the prices for 120 days ago, now if you compare to 10~ days ago, when states starting reopening... prices are now stagnant or decreasing. Super Mario Galaxy 1 and 2 both dropped 7% in the last 10 days, and most other titles did the same. I'm think we are leaving the apex of used game buying from people on eBay and other sites to endure this pandemic. The states are reopening and people will soon be looking to get out of these purchases.\n\n$GME no longer reports used games sales, but the last time they did they had a 42.7% gross margin on used game sales vs the 23% gross margin on new video games. I would wager it's still around there, maybe closer to 40% because they have gotten a lot of exclusive licenses the last few years. Anyways, I think in the next couple of weeks/months we are going to see a very large influx of people trying to get rid of these games and consoles, and as I said they are more inclined to bring to gamestop than a mom and pop game store. The barrier of entry in eBay pushes a lot of people away (as an eBay seller I hear this all the time) and these people are going to consider the loss worth it because they got their entertainment out of it during the pandemic. So Gamestop will offer them 10% of what they paid, and they will take it because they give zero fucks.\n\nUnfortunately, I do not track volume of sales I perhaps should do that in the future. But I can attest to the volume actually increasing, and these are out of print games, these are just leaving hands of consumers to consumers. I've also been to several game stores in the last month and they almost all are low on inventory. Games of note do not last more than a day, and even random shit ones are popping in price.\n\n**Positions / Ideas**  \nSince this is currently about to happen, and Gamestop is a fucking dumpster fire of a company, I'm not looking for any options for this year. The earliest I would take is the 1/15/21 $5c. I think there is pretty good upside there and it's really the only one with decent volume, even though the IV is trash. I'm personally going to wait to see if it drops more in the next week or two, and snatch a handful.\n\nAnyone maybe more technical able to see if there is anything here? I'm basing this solely on the fact that used game trade ins are going to spike dramatically, which will in turn make their inventory increase and sales would come (as long as Gamestop is still in business by then). I don't have anything in regards to them actually selling the games, so maybe that will shoot this in the foot. Anyways looking for some ideas on how retarded I have become", "created_utc": 1590548871.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/grbmju/gme_long_calls_potential/", "is_self": true}
