Each FD shows stats, pictures of the CEO, and news articles and if you swipe right you instantly buy that option. Also once a day you get one free super like and each option shows how many people have super-liked it. What do you all think, potential Robinhood killer?\n\nThere's a similar app already but it looks kinda ugly so I think we need to create a nice one for WSB. WDYT? Will it be better without the stats, just pics of the ceo?", "created_utc": 1581273600, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f1cvxt/guys_i_just_had_an_idea_for_a_new_trading_app/", "is_self": true}
