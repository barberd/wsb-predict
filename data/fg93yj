The IV on the closer dates calls and the spread given the halt convinced me to go long dates for hardly any additional time expense with VIX through the roof.\n\n1. RSI : We are somewhat oversold after a -8% day\n\n2. Put/Call Ratio : Last time it was this high it was Q4 2018 the day of the bottom\n\n3. Monetary & Fiscal Policy : both signaling supporting markets, generally when both agree it\u2019s ultra bullish but in times of panic it is short lived\n\n4. The entire yield curve is now green (not known when I purchased calls but further strengthen my narrative) since the market close.\n\n5. Fixed income is so high institutions who take gains or rebalance into equity will eventually want to take some money off the table to satisfy their quarterlies.\n\n6. FX Carry Trade will unwind as the FED cuts 1-2 times next week (based on CME probabilities) this will see the bond prices die.\n\nAll together I am ultra bullish until we hit a Fibonacci retracement level 61.8% around 314. After which I am exiting my position and if the retracement hits the next fib level at 78.6% around 325 I\u2019m loading up on puts at the first sign of economic weakness until this \ud83d\udc3b slides down the \ud83c\udf08 into the a pot of gold at the 200 level.\n\nIn 2008 the VIX remained elevated above 30 for 9 months. I\u2019m buckled up, are you?\n\nAlso for further confirmation:\n\n7. Futures up 3.64%.\n\nOnce my gain is huge I\u2019ll await reentry for the ride to tendie heaven.", "created_utc": 1583819091.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fg93yj/a_bull_trap_thesis_i_am_long_spy_calls/", "is_self": true}
