Enphase designs and manufactures software-driven home energy\u00a0solutions\u00a0that span solar generation,\u00a0home energy storage\u00a0and web-based monitoring and control. Enphase has shipped about twenty million\u00a0solar microinverters, primarily into the residential and commercial markets in North America, Europe and Australia. Microinverters convert the\u00a0direct current\u00a0power from the\u00a0solar panel\u00a0(DC) directly into grid-compatible\u00a0alternating current\u00a0(AC) for use or export. Enphase was the first company to successfully commercialise the microinverter on a wide scale, and remains the market leader in their production.", "created_utc": 1582401919, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7xy2t/the_case_for_enphase_enph/", "is_self": true}
