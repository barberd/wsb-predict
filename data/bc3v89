I'm buying calls.", "selftext": "I think $TRUP is about to post HUGE numbers in early May (5/7) that'll destroy last quarters and YOY earnings.  It'll be unexpected, the driving catalyst for these larger than expected numbers are a couple of very large \"Google updates\" that occurred over the past quarter -- something that nobody outside of Google can anticipate or forecast.  These updates drastically improved search engine rankings and positions for Trupanion for pet insurance related keywords.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWeb savvy people can use publicly available tools to look at the estimate traffic for [Trupanion.com](https://Trupanion.com).  Organic search traffic has shot up drastically over the past several months, 30-40% from just a few months ago.  50% from the same time last year.  The popularity for \"pet insurance\" and related searches in general has skyrocketed over the past few years -- it's fairly easy to look at this too if you know what you're doing.  Google Trends is the most basic of said tools:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;geo=US&amp;q=pet%20insurance](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;geo=US&amp;q=pet%20insurance)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe beauty of increased organic traffic is that it equates to more eyeballs/sales but it has fixed costs, other than a team or guy doing \"SEO\" for your site.  It's printing money when these updates occur.\n\n  \nThe importance/value of web/organic traffic varies wildly of course, all depends on your customer acquisition and whether visitors to your site translates into sales -- for a service like Trupanion, whether they market online or offline, organic site visitors is an incredible indicator of how sales/popularity are currently trending.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm buying calls for 5/17.
