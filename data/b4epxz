Personally, I think the people on CNBC that are trying to do mental gymnastics to justify why they think the market isn't about to crash into a recession are far more delusional than us autists on this sub. If I want to understand how smart people think about the market, then I watch videos from The Money GPS, David Stockman, Bull Boom Bear Bust, Epic Economist, Silver Report Uncut, Mike Maloney, and the Morgan Report. If I want to know what the morons are thinking then I watch CNBC. Are there more sources for idiots so I can truly understand how stupid the average investor is?", "created_utc": 1553313965, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b4epxz/is_there_a_better_place_to_go_than_cnbc_to/", "is_self": true}
