{"id": "bycbhv", "title": "AMD", "selftext": "Got no skin the in the game (neither short nor long), but look at the financials. Very little revenue growth, almost zero net income, very little assets. Compare this to intel which has revenue growth, nearly 4 bil+ in net income quarterly, and almost ~120 bil in assets. \n\nIn terms of AMD's tech, they have literally no advantage over Intel. They have a temporary short term advantage by using TSMC's 7nm process. Whenever Intel decides to get their heads out of their asses, they'll drop their 10nm chips and destroy AMD. \n\nNow, don't even get me started on the GPU front. AMD cannot compete against NVDA. Not even in the same ballpark. Nvidia now has a complete moat around datacenter (with mellanox acquisition + cuda software) and gaming (with ray tracing cores and ray tracing software). \n\nShort term, AMD will gain small amounts of CPU market share, but it won't matter because the company still won't make money. When intel drops 10nm chips, they will crush AMD on the CPU front. When NVDA drops ampere chips, they will crush AMD on the GPU front.\n\nI'll repeat: AMD stands NO chance. They have ZERO competitive advantage in any industry they are in. Intel and Nvidia's R&amp;D budgets are waaaaay higher than AMD's. Anyone buying stock in this company is a fool and long term bag holders will get crushed.
