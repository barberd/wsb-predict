{"id": "eunl9a", "title": "TSLA earnings double calendar", "selftext": "I am looking into opening a double calendar position on TSLA to capitalize on the post-earnings movement. The short position would be sold expiring this Friday, while the long position would be chosen 2-4 weeks from now for example.\n\nTo avoid assignment risk I would choose OTM calls on one side and OTM puts on the other one.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n- sell 1 Jan 31 530 put\n- sell 1 Jan 31 585 call\n- buy 1 Feb 21 530 put\n- buy 1 Feb 21 585 call\n\nThe P/L chart looks promising. My only concern with this trade is vega. Using the data from last close, this position would have about 330 theta and 65 vega, with low delta. Even if the breakeven points are quite far apart, isn't volatility crush going to move them closer?\n\nWhat do you think?", "created_utc": 1580130098, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eunl9a/tsla_earnings_double_calendar/", "is_self": true}
