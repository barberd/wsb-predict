Decade old impractical choppers are wayyy overpriced. \n\nMakes sense in an ATH economy, but in this shit? Absolutely not. \n\nIndicator is, they\u2019re selling. People are buying them. This means that liquidity still exists and the capital hoarding boomers do not take this seriously as an economic threat. When choppers cease being 10k per across the board, THAT is when the end is near and the plunge is coming. \n\n8/17 SPY 235p", "created_utc": 1586879229.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g17xoe/the_chopper_index/", "is_self": true}
