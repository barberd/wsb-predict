What caused this company to become so undervalued?", "selftext": "This DD is an overview on ITP's \"Golden Era\" with shareholders from it's rise and fall, and where they are right now. This is mostly unimportant history depending on your reading abilities, but I did some research on it through the SEC files and am leaving it here for you retards.\n\nIn their May 2009 Q1 Report, they reported their total assets estimated to be $55,966,024. Total Liabilities were estimated to be $19,624,902 and total stockholders equity was estimated to be $55,966,024.\n\nIn their May 2020 Q1 Report, total assets were estimated to be $182,256,298. Total Liabilities were estimated to be $14,032,616 and total shareholders equity was $160,969,021.\n\nAs one can tell, this company has significantly grown in value up to now. And yet, share value has only gone down. This 2009 quarterly was reported before the great spike in their share prices (which were roughly .375). During that time they had 45,101,987 outstanding shares. Today there are currently 22,054,816 outstanding shares.\n\nIn August of 2009, the CEO Zhenyong Liu issued a statement that the company was going to begin an investor relations campaign. \n\nIn September of 2009, they announced the company was going to do a reverse split. 55% of shareholders agreed to one. This is one such example that will prove RS can sometimes be a good thing for companies. The CEO went on an investor's campaign and large investors are typically never interested in pennystocks, so was likely reccomended to do this. Each three-to-five shares of Common Stock owned before the effective time of the Reverse Split was converted automatically into one share. After the RS, shares were worth almost $4 and steadily climbing. Before the RS, shares were also steadily climbing and were at around .89-.94. They had increased this much from .375 in June (Roughly a 40% increase).\n\n\nIn the end of October of 2009, there was a big change in the board of directors, in which several tenured members stepped down. This is where things started to seriously change, from which share value went exponentially up. Before the end of October shares were each worth around 6.84. By the end of November they became worth around 10.00 each (a little over 30%). This was during the course of their Q3 reports and in anticipation of them. \n\nTotal assets were worth $64,281,784 total liabilities $16,605,693, shareholder equity 47,676,091. Approximately 11,697,557 shares outstanding. Earnings per share were only 0.41. So why did ITP go up so much during this time period? It was in this case, a bubble. Investors realized the company was undervalued and caused it to become overvalued. It stayed at these heights hovering above $9 per share until July 2010.\n\nThis was when they began to have Third Party Investigations by Muddy Waters. Some of you may know of Muddy Waters LLC; to put it simply they conduct investigative research into companies and are renowned for it. On June 28 2010, Muddy Waters accused ITP of missapporpriating $30 million dollars in October 2009, which had quickly brought their \"Golden Era\" with public investors to an end. This instantly shot share value prices down from $9 to $5. ITP defended themselves against the accusation and still deny it, but share values never fully returned to their height, and entered into a decline with a number of dilutions.\n\nBefore ITP were called Orient Papers and changed their name in 2018. They were technically forced to change their ticker and name (ITP) since the allegations by Muddy Waters permanently ruined their public image. The corruption charges are likely related to when most on the board of directors were forced to step down in October (which happened before the allegation). It is ironic though that Muddy Waters accused them of being overvalued, making them extremely undervalued for almost ten years. \n\nITP shares are extremely undervalued and it\u2019s understandable if you look into their past. Were they overvalued when they were over $10? Yes. Did they go down way too much? Yes. Not only this, but the company is far more valuable than it was 10 years ago and have grown significantly for their upcoming Quarter Two Report. \n\n\nOn July 23, ITP will be having it's annual shareholder meeting. One such proposal shareholders voted on may change this 5+ year downtrend: \n\n\"Approval of a Reduction in the Exercise Price of Outstanding Warrants Issued in a Private Placement and the approval of the issuance of common stock representing more than 20% of our common stock issued and outstanding upon exercise of the warrants in accordance with NYSE American Rule 713(A)(II)\"\n\nThis is the NYSE American Rule 713(A)(II): \n\nThe sale, issuance, or potential issuance by the issuer of common stock (or securities convertible into common stock) equal to 20% or more of presently outstanding stock for less than the greater of book or market value of the stock.\n\nIn other words, they are planning to issue shares between the market value and book value of the company and the value of these shares represent more than 20% of the current outstanding shares' value. Now what is the book value of this stock?\n\n\"The issuance by the Company of the Shares, together with the Warrants, would be in excess of 20% of the Company\u2019s issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock as of the Execution Date, and the exercise price of $0.7425 of the Warrants issued in the private placement was less than the book value of our Common Stock as of December 31, 2019, which was $7.53 per share.\"\n\nSo let\u2019s say in example they planned to issue total equity consideration of 500,000 of the Company's restricted common stock (if not more, Im using this number bc 20% increase in stock equity is a definite): \n\n22,054,000(.54)+500,000(7.5)/22,554,000\n\nThis will bring the shares up to at the very least roughly .15. The value of shares increasing is a definite thing that will occur after the shareholder meeting, so I expect people to get in before July 23rd. \n\nTL;DR Buy and hold ITP for July and August", "created_utc": 1593127926.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hfwova/it_tech_packaging_20092010_then_and_now_what/", "is_self": true}
