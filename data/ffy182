Scared if you buy just *one* /CL contract at $60 and say Saudi Arabia tweets they're going to flood the oil market and suddenly /CL is trading at $30, meaning you've lost $30,000 overnight? Then you should check out Spread Trading!\n\nNote: I originally wrote this [two months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/PostPreview/comments/ea1kc8/test/) as trading futures has a lot of idiosyncrasies I needed to absolutely cover for you guys. Thanks to beer-virus /CL really did drop from $60 to $30~ at the time I posted this. Spread trading would have drastically hedged your losses vs raw contracts. \n\n# What is Spread Trading?\nAre you familiar with [pairs trading](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pairstrade.asp) in the equity world? The same idea exists in the futures world and it's the way to go. There are two types of spread trades:\n\n**The Calendar Spread** - also known as a **Intracommodity Spread**. The trader goes long in one month contract and short in another month, both in the same commodity. For most commodities a bullish position is long in the closer month and short in the longer month. Bullish price action tends to increase prices in contracts that expire sooner than later on contracts. \n\nOne popular calendar trade is the \"famed\" natural gas (/NG) \"widowmaker\" spread - trading the March and April natural gas contracts. March is generally the end of winter weather while April is the start of summer. A bullish bet on natural gas will long march and short April, while a bearish bet will take the opposite trade. This spread has a \"probablistic\" floor of $0.00. If it goes negative it means March contracts is a lot cheaper than April and that would be very unusual. You can get in at say $0.05, risking $500 per contract, and if the spread up to $0.50 you'll have a position worth $5,000. In the past under severe winter weather the spread has shot up to $1.5 or $15k per contract or even more... Now, why is it called the Widowmaker? Imagine if you sold short the spread  ; made the bearish bet... \n\n**The Intercommodity Spread** - a trader goes long in one commodity and shorts a related commodity. Some popular examples are crude oil and heating oil, or corn and wheat. Taking corn and wheat, for example, wheat tends to trade higher than corn but most people will turn to corn products if the difference is too high. Suppose wheat got unreasonably high compared to corn. A trader could decide to short wheat and long corn, expecting the wheat price to drop faster relative to corn and making a \"reversion to the mean\" sort of play. \n\n# Why trade spreads?\n\nIt lowers your margin! It's generally safer and less volatile. (Shorting the natural gas widowmaker being an exception.) Let's use Natural Gas's Widowmaker as an example (/NG) as an example. The contracts have a +10,000 delta for march and a -10,000 delta for April, leaving a net delta of 0. This position uses very little margin but has wide swings and huge risk reward potential. It's almost like buying a call option with no theta burn and having to front very little money, as futures are *marked to market* daily. Your actual losses and gains come directly out of your futures account cash balance (or a margin loan if you have no cash balance.) You're free to invest your cash balance you receive each day if you're on the right end of the trade. \n\n*Note: for regulatory reasons while your brokerage shows your futures positions on your brokerage account it's a* **segregated** account at a subsidiary of your broker. Meaning on Reg-T Margin trading futures comes out of \"Option Buying Power\" or is treated the same as **withdrawing cash.**  Keep this in mind or you may have a surprise margin interest bill even though your broker's cash balance is showing positive say from options premium selling. Since it's a different account Box-Spread Financing or options premium selling can't be offset, so you have the possibility of having a debit margin balance unless you have actual cash for the futures themselves. Most brokers will auto sweep cash to your stock/margin account but TD Ameritrade is problematic and auto-sweeps sometimes don't happen. You can easily contact customer service and they'll sweep out the cash balance whenever you request.\n\nExchanges even lower margins for various Intercommodity  spreads. Let's say wheat is getting some crazy price action due to a new fungus that's destroying wheat crops, while corn is remaining very stable, and you want to long wheat because of this. Just longing wheat will use a ton of margin. However, the future exchanges give you a 60% margin reduction credit if you short corn based on historical correlation. You free up some significant margin to put more on your trade. You still have downside protection if something unexpected happened to the grain market as a whole like the USA banning all grain products in food thanks to the success of the low carb keto diet.\n\n#Trading individual futures contracts contains hidden currency risk\n\nGoing long on just the underlying future contract is **very deceptive.** Going long on just /CL is not just a bullish bet on oil, it's a bullish bet on oil and a bearish bet (shorting) USD. Why is it shorting the almighty American Dollar? Well, what are the contracts priced in? USD! If the US dollar rises oil should drop in price as the whole world buys oil in other currencies and not just in USD. \n\nBy making a spread trade on /CL you **cancel out USD** and are purely betting long or short oil. Changes to USD are very likely to affect both contracts the same amount. To account for relative velocity between the expiration dates of the two contracts I'll add + sign, one for each month the nearer contract is ahead of the far contract. Here is a math example trade:            \n          \nBullish on oil, long the July contract and short the December contract.    \nJuly Contract: +++++long oil, short USD     \nDecember Contract: short oil, long USD         \nFinal Position:   ++++long oil\n\nYou can see how short USD and long USD cancel out now. Need a easy way on how to remember trading raw contracts by themselves are a bet on USD? Just remember there are futures on euros and other currencies which are all denominated in USD.\n\nUsing my + method is a good way to think about the interaction between near and far dates as to the velocity and acceleration of price changes. Oil typically increases in price in summer months. Trading July vs August will be a small spread. If July increases in price then so will August. July is likely to increase faster as more people travel and drive in July in general in America than August but lots of people still travel in August and so it'll be a very small increase. July will increase much faster than December, with the far time away giving people who need oil in December time to acquire and wait for better prices, thus less price movement/action! Price increases need to sustain that long until December! This brings up one risk of spreads is **seasonality risk.**\n\nYes, as a rule of thumb generally a bullish beat is long the front and short a later month. However, there is seasonality to the trade. Long June and short July in oil **will not** behave this way, and in-fact is a **bearish** bet. This is known as seasonality risk. More people are expected to travel in July so with how oil behaves naturally it's more likely it'll spike harder and faster in the July contract than the June contract. It's of course not guaranteed - imagine if there is a shortage and suppliers can't even supply June. Best way of avoiding seasonality? Spread out your long and short bets across different seasons. \n\nGoing back to the Natural Gas example you can think of seasonality as longing a fall and shorting a winter contract will also tend to be a bearish bet, as winter contracts tend to increase a lot higher and faster than fall or summer contracts. Of course this isn't certain - have a early winter snowstorm in Fall before enough natural gas is stored is certainly going to spike fall natural gas contracts relative to winter contracts. This is another great example of **seasonality risk.**\n\n# Ok, trading spreads sounds great, but how do I actually trade spreads?\n\nThere are two options available: The **spread market** and the **composite market.** I'll break it down how it operates on Thinkorswim. Other platforms may vary.\n\nFirst, I'll talk about the **composite market.** This is the simplest trade order but it's very risky. You have to execute two orders at the same time - such as a \"blast all\" order, and hope you get good fills. This is like legging into a call/put option spread trade - trying to long and short two different call options at two different strikes. You're trying to get in a good position. Unfortunately this may be your only choice, especially if it's a more advanced Intercommodity Spread you're trying to trade. You can chart the composite market simply in TOS by charting say this year's widowmaker spread by typing in: /NGH20-/NGJ20\n\nEnter the **spread market:** Fortunately there are many popular spreads you don't need to leg in yourself! They have markets set up that take orders specifying the spread amount you want to buy and market makers will fill orders for you. The famed widowmaker has it's own spread market set up by the exchange. In the Desktop TOS app you can access it via the dropdown on the top of the quote screen changing \"Spread: Single\" to \"Spread: Calendar.\" This will show you every spread market that is officially established on the exchanges. You can also do charting and buy on the spread market by typing in: =/NGH21-/NGJ21  \n\nThe equals sign in-front of the two future products is **VERY** important. This is TOS's shortcut to chart and place orders on the spread market. All the price and volume shown here is what was traded on the spread market. Without the equals sign it's the composite market and the price/volume shown is just the sum of the price/volume of the two futures individually traded vs other traders explicitly trading spreads. Note: I don't know how other brokers let you make orders on the spread market. The equals sign may just be unique to TOS.\n\nSpecial note for mobile users of Thinkorswim - for the longest time I was very frustrated with trying to trade calendar spreads on mobile. I used to set up large GTC orders from the desktop app that'd never get filled so I could adjust on mobile. I then learned about the damn equals sign and it's a hidden cheat code to unlock spread orders on mobile. Put in the damn equal sign and you can place mobile spread market orders with ease. There is no UI option to access spreads to trade futures on mobile on TOS. \n\n**If a spread market exists always trade the spread market. Don't risk trading the composite market.**\n\nNote for TOS mobile users - the home screen on mobile will always quote your home screen calendar position on the composite market which will lead to wild price displays. Don't freak out about this, you're most likely not losing thousands of dollars then gaining thousands of dollars over the manner of minutes. The desktop app properly quotes the spread market if it exists. This gives me a good idea to try out algorithmic trading and see if there is any arbitrage opportunities between composite and spread markets, but I bet it's there is huge competition there already.\n\n# Check out my other guides:\n\n[Box Spread Financing for extremely cheap 0.85% margin interest rates.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fegqz0/box_spread_financing_for_extremely_cheap_085/)  \n    \n(now 0.50% APR due to interest rates dropping more lol.)    \n      \n\n[Portfolio Margin is 10x worse than /u/1R0NYMAN's box spread trick](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fepd4q/portfolio_margin_is_10x_worse_than_u1r0nymans_box/)\n\n# TL;DR what strike/option/call/etc\n\nThis guide was about spreads trading...
