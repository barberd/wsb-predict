The bear you\u2019ve tried to hide might be revealed; the truths that have been buried might now come to the surface, the printer might run out of ink. This is a week for reckoning with the truth of what you really feel, whether that truth is beautiful, or painful, or something else entirely.\n\nSPY Weekly Horoscope\n\nThis week, it\u2019s going to be so important to be thoughtful about where you give your attention. This is so much more difficult than it seems. The shrill buzzing of the news has pulled you in every direction, leaving you too exhausted to move. Your constant awareness of human suffering can wear on you, too, until you have hardly energy left for green day. Remember that it isn\u2019t your job to see and know everything. Instead, try to protect your attention, so that you\u2019ve got enough energy left for action. Sea of red flowers can be nice too, and you know it.\n\nTESLA Weekly Horoscope\n\nSometimes, meeting all of life\u2019s challenges just feels awful, like a heavy and never-ending burden. But other times \u2014 like this week \u2014 not every challenge has to feel so bad. This week, a real and vibrant joy will be available to you when you stretch to your full height after daddy Elon tweet about is alien baby coming today. You'll rise to this occasion, when you show yourself what you\u2019re capable of, when you try. Giving yourself the chance to use all your power is a way of caring for yourself, too, and doing so can light up your days when you need it most.\n\nAMAZON Weekly Horoscope\n\nYou might feel starved for some kind of attention this week, starved of the care you need. It might feel as though nobody sees you as you truly are, as though nobody is able to reflect your light back to you. It\u2019s not your fault if you\u2019re struggling with autist and mask, and it\u2019s not your fault if you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed with orders. Your needs aren\u2019t unreasonable; you\u2019re just doing your best to live in a changed world. You\u2019re still real and alive, and things will, eventually, soften. You\u2019ll get what you need again, but not this week. This week, you'r gonna shit your pants.\n\nAPPLE Weekly Horoscope\n\nThis is a week for getting stubbornly, quietly confrontational. It\u2019s a week for digging in your heels, for refusing to believe that your stock is worth less than MSFT \u2014 but also for refusing to believe that your product is worth more. Look around at the sunlight, the mountains, the sky. Look around at all the people who starve at your cash. This world will follow you. You can reject the idea that you need rulers, that you need heroes, that you need an authority to tell you how to live/ Instead, you can choose to create some \"avant-garde\" phone...\n\nGILEAD Weekly Horoscope\n\nThis week, remind yourself that it is okay to rest when you\u2019ve lied. It is okay not to push beyond your limits. There\u2019s nothing wrong with turning down every offer that isn\u2019t good enough, and nothing wrong with striving to do less. There\u2019s nothing wrong with refusing to pump your stock and energy to a market who don\u2019t value you enough, or who don\u2019t care at all. There\u2019s power in working hard, to be sure, but there\u2019s also a wild and glittering magic in quitting, in saying no, in stepping away.\n\nCGC Weekly Horoscope\n\nNot getting what you deserve doesn\u2019t change the fact that you do deserve it. Sometimes, though, when your needs aren\u2019t being met, it can seem so much less daunting to try and change your attitude, rather than trying to change the world. Compromise can often seem like a wiser course of action. But this isn\u2019t a week for compromise. Constellation got you with the warrants, it\u2019s not a week to give in to the people telling you that you\u2019re worth less. Don\u2019t let the unfairness of the world make you forget about the truth, which is that you deserve everything: everything good, everything soft, everything sweet.", "created_utc": 1588595644.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gdaryv/technical_astrology_weekly_edition/", "is_self": true}
