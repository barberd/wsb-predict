Well it\u2019s true & you better get used to it. Want to know why those unemployment numbers won\u2019t matter tomorrow? Priced IN. Why are they priced in? Each and every single one of those people is receiving $1,200 a week. Or $4,800 a month. That\u2019s a yearly salary of roughly $58,000. I know the program is only for four months, but that\u2019s four months to get the economy back rolling & ramp testing up so we can be at a point to mitigate the virus. You can thank Bernie, Trump & J Pow for giving some socialism to the American people while we ride it out. Some people are making more right now than they have in their entire lives. Think about that. They\u2019re spending that money, it\u2019s going into the economy... you just need to look at the signs where. Sure certain sectors are s.o.l for a while, but it doesn\u2019t matter. Money is flowing in. \n\nTL;DR: Don\u2019t get caught holding puts.
