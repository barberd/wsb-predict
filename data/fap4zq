Using the money from ~~multiple personal loans~~ diligently saving for the past year, I bought 200 shares of MRNA at $18.98 and 275 shares of APT at $6.92 Monday morning after I realized beervirus was going to kill all of our grandparents and boyfriends. I've continued to ~~risk bankruptcy~~ buy APT throughout the week with margin and other loans. I sold MRNA at $33 today because they're as likely to make money from this as one of you offering $5 handies at the back of an Arby's. I'm riding APT to $100 or bust.
