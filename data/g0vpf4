{"id": "g0vpf4", "title": "Should I just take the money and run?", "selftext": "During the downturn I have turned $200 into $10,000 by swing trading short dated spy puts. During this bull rally I have been diamond handsing June SPY 220 puts and June VXX 55 calls. Through this rally, my once $10000 gains have turned into $5000. I've been able to mitigate the damage through AMD calls, CCL calls, USO calls, as well as calls on biotech companies.\n\nI have a thesis that the next market downturn will be caused by the housing market crashing and small businesses defaulting on loans along with low demand for goods within the economy. \n\nHowever, I am starting to doubt the downturn will come in time. I am worried hope combined with the economy reopening will delay a downturn until my positions expire worthless. For these reasons, I am considering just taking the money and running because I am tired of watching my tendies vanish before my eyes.\n\nI am not a rich man but 5k is not a big deal to me. I am willing to risk it all for the chance of turning it into a much larger amount, however, I am starting to doubt my bets. I would rather not lose all my tendies but at the same time I'm tempted to keep holding to gain them back (and possibly much more)\n\nFellow autists, what would you guys do if you were me? Should I just go #cashgang until bad news comes about and hop on it right away? Or should I keep my diamond hands going strong?\n\nIf you want proof let me know, I can post it easily but flexing tendies is not the purpose of this post.", "created_utc": 1586825945.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0vpf4/should_i_just_take_the_money_and_run/", "is_self": true}
