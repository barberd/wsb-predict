PM me or comment any ticker you want my thoughts on and I\u2019ll add them here.\n\n$TSLA- BULLISH \n\nI\u2019m confident that Tesla will report a higher than expected EPS (-$0.48). The great thing is TSLA can still report a negative eps and the stock will still shoot up. I have a few reasons for being bullish on the stock. Mainly my position on this ticker is due to them slashing their prices. I don't see a reason why they would slash prices if they were deep in the red for the year. Tesla has had a really good past month and I don't see that ending any time soon. \n\n\nThis is not investment advice.
