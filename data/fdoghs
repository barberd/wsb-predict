{"id": "fdoghs", "title": "A Comparison of Influenza & The Corona Virus", "selftext": "There are an estimated 115.59 million people in America over the age of 50. So let's do the math and start by whittling this down by age brackets. The 50 to 59 age group has a 1.3% mortality rate, and the 60 to 69 bracket has a 3.6% mortality rate. The 70 to 79 age group has a mortality rate of 8%, and the 80+ age bracket has a 21.9% mortality rate. There are 42.84 million Americans in the 50-59 group, 37.41 million in the 60 to 69 group, 22.66 million in the 70 to 79 group, and 12.68 million in the 80+ group.\n\nThat means that the estimated loss of life for Americans will be 6.5 million, and that's not including younger folks and those with existing medical conditions that put them at risk. There's 331 million in America, so that's roughly 2% of the population.\n\nAccording to the CDC, the flu kills roughly 61,000 people annually and infects about 45 million people annually. That's a fatality ratio of approximately 0.1%. A fair comparison of the math would compare the population bases as a whole in this scenario, so assuming all 331 million people get infected then approximately 331 thousand people would perish.\n\n331k (flu) versus 6.5m (COV19)\n\nSo it's obvious the COV19 virus is much much worse, and again that comparison includes young and ill people in the flu counts and doesn't include them in the COV19 counts. So it's likely worse than these statistics suggest.\n\nThis is merely a cursory comparison of the disease rates with an assumed 100% infection rate of both diseases. There are many other factors at play that are not discussed in this post but given this disease becomes as similarily widespread as the flu it is a mathematically fair comparison.\n\nReferences:\n\nCDC.
