{"id": "gicar3", "title": "Buy The Rumour, Sell The News. Fed ETF Buying.", "selftext": "After about 3 minutes of DD I realized the Fed is officially going to start buying corporate bond ETFs today. I'm sure their fingers are going to \"slip\" and buy a few SPY shares too. \n\nNo one is taking on significant risk in this market, except the overnight PPT. It is being propped up. Daddy Powell has whispered sexy words like \"infinite QE\" and \"I'll do anything at all costs to keep this market up, I'll even sell the souls of the next generation to the illuminati.\" \n\nIf you're a billionaire investor, who invested in a dog shit company such as one of the largest automakers in the world, Daddy Powell's words are reassuring. It is going to stop you from panic selling. If you could buy more dog shit you would, but you're leveraged to the tits and can't afford it. You gotta deleverage. \n\nSo rich investors are dumb, but not as dumb as Jimmy with 5K in a robinhood account saying \"follow the Fed, stocks up, guh, I am so smart cuz I read the USO fact sheet\". Rich investors know the party is over and they are going to dump their shit onto the Fed when they can. \n\nThat time is now. Investors can finally take a steamy dump on the Fed. They couldn't before because Jimmy's 5K account could only buy 10 shares while they wanted to sell 10 million. Fed will gladly put those 10 million shares on their balance sheet for the next generation to deal with.", "created_utc": 1589293895.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gicar3/buy_the_rumour_sell_the_news_fed_etf_buying/", "is_self": true}
