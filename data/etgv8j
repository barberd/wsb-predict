But we don't even have to get into the nitty-gritty DD to show this is a quick way to get some tendies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGamestop has good numbers - it's currently (as of market close 1/24/20) trading at $4.32 and is getting annihilated by the market in 2020 (down almost 30% already YTD) - but here's the catch: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGME currently has a 105% short interest, with a short ratio of 10.85. You motherfuckers have literally shorted more shares then are outstanding. At this price and short interest you would think that GME already filed Chapter 8 (even if the financials argue they have a ways to go). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n$GME boys, there's money to be made\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ox4exmn9nsc41.jpg?width=1403&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=297f5559a5bd93766e55144abb88484c6c74a128", "created_utc": 1579901073, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/etgv8j/gme_short_bubble/", "is_self": true}
