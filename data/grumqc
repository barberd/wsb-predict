If you actually read their filings, all initial NKLA investors have a lock up period of 180 days before they can sell. Similar with original VTIQ shareholders. The market is NOT getting flooded with 300M new sell orders next week. The original PIPE shares can be sold, but there are significantly less of these than there are the locked shares. If dilution is a problem from this, it will hit in 6 months.\n\n2) MY SHARES ARE GONNA BE $10 - No they\u2019re not, they transfer directly at market price.\n\n3) NKLA can force redeem my warrants?? - Yeah but it has to be trading at $18 for a month for them to do this, which puts the floor of warrants value at $6.50 if there is a risk of redemption.\n\n4) Are warrants fairly priced? In my opinion they\u2019re still at a discount to the stock price. They should be trading $11.50 below the stock price, similar to DKNGW. I don\u2019t see NKLA trading below $20 post-merger, so I am comfortable holding warrants at a cost basis of 8.\n\n5) Their founder\u2019s history is nothing but 2 bankrupt companies!!! \nAlso another bullshit story floating around. Milton\u2019s second company focused on overhauling diesel engines and was successful until an investor began stealing Intellectual Capital from the firm and screwed them over. Milton then took the shambles of this company and built a multimillion dollar engine company (dHybrid Systems) from scratch which he sold to Worthington Industries for several million. \n\nHis background with dHybrid is one of the reasons I trust his judgement in alternative truck engines, and the proceeds from that sale helped fund NKLA. Personally I think his background supports NKLA more than it hinders it.\n\nAgain, this is still a speculative play and I may be wrong. Do your own DD but don\u2019t listen to the naysayers who spew ridiculous stats they saw on seeking alpha.", "created_utc": 1590621312.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/grumqc/informative_vtiqnkla_post_because_no_one_actually/", "is_self": true}
