Perhaps it is an indictment though. Overall impressions I got from reading Reddit posts was unhappiness with personalization, cost, perception of being sold unwanted merch at full price, and low quality of clothing compared to cost.\n\nTrunkclub: [\"From my experience with the one trunk I received a few weeks ago and shopping on the nordstrom website now, a lot of full price items they sent me are now on sale.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/8qk3sy/for_anyone_usingthinking_about_using_trunkclub/), other complaints about 'personal' stylist services\n\nStitchfix has been making it harder to cancel your account: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stitchfix/comments/gu37d3/predatory\\_practice\\_unable\\_to\\_cancel\\_account/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stitchfix/comments/gu37d3/predatory_practice_unable_to_cancel_account/)\n\nUser reports their emails seem \"increasingly desperate: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/guo5vj/is\\_sfix\\_as\\_legit\\_as\\_it\\_looks/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/guo5vj/is_sfix_as_legit_as_it_looks/)\n\nPlus SFIX laying off all those people (and supposedly rehiring in the future) is not bullish.
