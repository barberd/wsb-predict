{"id": "fkgazc", "title": "Latin American E-commerce is Fucked (MELI puts)", "selftext": "New and learning. Bear (pun intended) with me.\n\nMercadolibre (MELI) is essentially the Latin American equivalent of Ebay. Obviously, COVID-19 and the looming recession stemming from it is going to cause a change in people's spending patterns. We've already started to see some layoffs in majorly affected industries, and will see more over the coming months (years?). This points to a decrease in sales in E-commerce based companies.\n\nMercadolibre mainly operates in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, and Venezuela. I am skeptical, to say the least, of the ability these governments will have staving off economic uncertainty in their countries. COVID is lagging behind a little from the US and Europe in these countries, but it is showing it will have a major effect on the area in the near future.\n\nThe major thing that will separate companies in this looming recession is profitability. Those who weren't profitable before COVID certainly aren't going to be post-COVID. MELI is certainly growing it's sales (up to 2.3B in 2019 from 1.4 in 2018) but still isn't profitable, and much of it's value is based upon the notion that it will be soon.\n\nMELI has a market cap of 26.6B, which is in the same ballpark of EBAY at 32B. The major differences  between the two are that EBAY is profitable and operates in a more stable area historically.\n\nMELI stock has taken a sharp COVID hit, down to $490 today after a $750 peak in late February. It seems to me that it has a ways more to fall in the next month.\n\nI'm new to this, feel free to rip the shit out of me.\n\nAlso I'm aware that the open interest on volume on these are dog shit. fuck it\n\nTLDR: MELI puts", "created_utc": 1584491184.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkgazc/latin_american_ecommerce_is_fucked_meli_puts/", "is_self": true}
