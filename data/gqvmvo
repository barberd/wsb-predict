While I do hold my own personal positions with a few of these companies, I am a relatively new trader and my positions amount to very little. My intention with this post is to spur discussion, while providing the insights I am basing my personal decisions on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# LK\n\nThis is the most obvious stock committing fraud is Luckin Coffee the \u201cStarbucks of China\u201d. Luckin Coffee admitted to such, details can be [found here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jenniferwang/2020/04/30/chinas-luckin-coffee-founder-is-1-billion-poorer-after-company-announces-fraud-investigation/#2523c5aa5bfe).\n\nSince January 2020 the stock has dropped from a $50 high to less than $2.00 per share where it currently sits.[Link to additional DD](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LKOYMpXVo1ssbWQx8j4G3-strg6mpQ7F/view)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# GSX\n\nMuddy Waters Research highlighted many of the questionable accounting practices at LK and is now going after Chinese online educator GSX Techedu Inc. (GSX). The company is described as being, \u201ca near total fraud\u201d.\n\nMuddy Waters states that 70% of users are fake and they believe the number of fake users could be as high as 80%.

I just found it interesting that Goldman Sachs increased their holding of NIO Puts by 250% from quarter 4 2019 to quarter 1 2020. They now hold 2.2 million NIO puts.
