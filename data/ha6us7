You fomo'd into puts at the bottom, and then into calls at the top. Every step you make is the wrong one, and there's a secret back door in your computer that tells the fed which direction to make the stonks go just so that they can personally fuck YOU of all people, the guy with $300 left from the $20k you had back in January.\n\n\nWell you're in luck! The King of Kangaroos is here to teach you to recover successfully from a rug pull, and how to negotiate that loss into some tendie sauce.\n\n\n\n**Market Background Information**\n\nLook around you. This market is easily the most fucked pile of steaming garbage the world has ever seen. Zoom, a video conferencing app, has almost the same valuation as Goldman Sachs, a hedge fund; a company that has not built a single product skyrocketed to 23B market cap (lookin' at you NKLA); and Boeing has both made and broken countless autists in the last month. \n\n\nQuit trying to out think the market, its more retarded than you are. You will lose. \"The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent\".\n\nInstead set your self up for success by profiting off of the fact that no one knows what anything is worth, which will be reflected in the prices every day. \n\nHere's a quick little taste of what I mean. Yesterday (Monday) I noticed that SPY had a gap down to the lows of last week, followed by full day chugging upwards back to $307. \n\n\nClearly people could only tell its price to +-$5, and thats going to be reflected at open, so I open the following positions yesterday right before market close when SPY is sitting at $307:\n\n2x BTO SPY 315C @1.12 per contract\n\n2x BTO SPY 300P @2.81 per contract\n\n1x BTO VIX 35P @2.50 per contract\n\nTotal cost of position (without trading fees) is $1036, however you could half this by buying only 1 call and 1 put.\n\nWhy did I do this? Im clearly bearish (we saw a 5% dip last week, why not this week?) so half of my position is supporting my bear thesis, but I build myself a hedge on both a gap up as well as volatility falling through the floor rendering both sides of my strangle worthless. My hedge is roughly the same price as my thesis, so I should be ok no matter what happens at open.\n\n\nFast forward to this morning at 9:30. Market gaps up to $315 for some ungodly reason, who tf knows, but clearly my bear thesis was absolutely wrong for today! Am I fucked? No! I exit my hedge immediately as follows:\n\n2x STC SPY 315C @ 4.00 per contract\n\n1x STC VIX 35P @ 3.60 per contract\n\nTotal is $1160, so I've already made $100 dollars on the confusion of others, I've covered my whole position so the only thing left on the table is play money, and I still have the rest of the week to look for an exit. Even if I exit the Puts for $1.00 each that's still another $200 profit AND ALL I DID WAS RIDE THE DELTA, but instead I will likely look for an opportunity to average down the cost of my puts, and try to exit the other side for a profit or break even.\n\nLook, this type of strategy will only be viable for another week or so, in reality as long as volatility remains high (which is anyone's guess really), so be careful trying to recreate this trade. \n\nBut keep it in the back pocket for the next time a rug pull happens. Don't hold onto those losing positions, but don't panic sell either. Kangaroo town will provide a few opportunities for you to minimize loses on your positions, and once you exit, grab yourself a straddle/strangle position, and ride that delta wave until a new trend emerges.\n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/E1pCttb", "created_utc": 1592323512.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ha6us7/how_to_make_money_in_kangaroo_town/", "is_self": true}
