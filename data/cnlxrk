Ended up cashing out my other stocks and held these calls.. Rome was rumored to be released so  I did a yolo $32 call when AMD reached  $27. Wishing I spent more money on calls  but I could have also lost all my money.  That was fun, not going to go on a ego trip thinking I\u2019m an investing god. Need to stick to my small option plays so I still have an account to play with.", "created_utc": 1565271708, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cnlxrk/small_account_amd_call_win_xd/", "is_self": true}
