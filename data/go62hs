These guys are real innovators and they have a great product. Bonus points: They actually know how to make money off of it.\n\nThey have $277 million in cash and only $3.4 million in debt meaning this covid-19 thing hasn't been that bad for them. Their revenue has grown each year and is $793 million for the past 12 months.\n\nGMED is really primed to take off now because healthcare is a mess in this country. There may be no other industry more poised for massive disruption in the near term than healthcare as hospitals begin to embrace technology (a little late) and look at ways to limit liability.\n\nMinimally invasive surgeries without GMED's robotics require specialized training and involves exposure to radiation that most surgeons don't want to fuck with. GMED's platform combines imaging, navigation, and the robotics themselves to make minimally invasive surgery safe, efficient, and a viable option for more surgeons. \n\nOne of the big rules to building a cash cow is selling consumables and GMED has done that as well. Along with the platform that hospitals buy into, they sell the related software, screws, rods, and implantables. Hospitals that purchase their systems are coming back and buying additional units, too.\n\nThe best part is, with the spinal shit working out as well as it has, they are launching a module designed for cranial procedures this quarter.\n\nWhy is it going to pop? The company originally expected to hit $850 million for 2020 and nobody expects them to actually do that. They weren't caught with their pants down during all of this, though, and they have remained committed to growing their business relationships and expanding their product offerings while everyone else is fearful. In the midst of covidmania, they've launched three new products in Q1, two more in April, and more to come. They recently bought back $100 million in stock and they are looking for acquisition targets. GMED is taking advantage of the situation, not running from it.\n\n\ntl;dr\n\nThis is a financially strong company bringing technology to the healthcare sector, increasing product offerings, and looking to take advantage of the shutdown to grow their business.\n\nGMED 06/19/20 57.50 C", "created_utc": 1590097702.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/go62hs/gmed_is_out_kicking_ass_while_everyone_else_is/", "is_self": true}
