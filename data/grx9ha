Buy at 359, sell at 931 the next day \n\nTSLA has opened positive 56% of days in 2020. Ironically, that\u2019s nearly same percentage as NBA home court advantage (remember sports?)\n\nHere\u2019s where TSLA differs bigly from SPY. 93% of its positive openings are greater than 4%. Negative openings are also quite dramatic as they drop more than 4% 82% of the time. \n\nIn terms of streaks, Tesla has opened positive 4 of the last 5 days, 10 of the last 15, and 18 of the last 30. \n\nUnless you\u2019re the type that likes to bet road dogs, short term TSLA calls are the way to Enjoy your tendies in one of Elon\u2019s magic mobiles. Thank you for your time and go fuck yourself.", "created_utc": 1590631230.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/grx9ha/time_to_take_a_look_at_2020_tsla_opens_before/", "is_self": true}
