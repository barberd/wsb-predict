And your girl just came down with a wicked cough, she is on bed rest.\n\nNot to mention PTON is a legit retarded stonk.\n\nTL;DR: PTON 7/17 15P\n\nThis retarded company is hemorrhaging cash and unlike useful companies that Donnie Autismo will bail out like BA or whatever his daughter tells him to, Peloton makes a fucking bike that goes nowhere.\n\nI looked at their financials, and not only am I mildly drunk, but they lost a fuck ton of money. -341% EBITA growth for 2019. People are losing their shit over toilet paper, no one is buying a goddamn stationary unicycle, fucking thing only has one wheel. 2019 Net income of negative 200 million and the company has never operated in profit. Their 0.15 earnings surprise in Feb only happened because your wive's boyfriends bought them that shit over Christmas. \n\nFuck you guys, thanks for the put tendies.", "created_utc": 1584418315.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjyvqn/peloton_is_trash_and_so_can_you/", "is_self": true}
