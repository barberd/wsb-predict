But now the price difference between calls and puts are like 5x it seems like a good idea to go theta and lock in some easy tendies.\n\nAs of now SPY ATM calls are around 3$ and ATM puts are 15$. So why don\u2019t you guys go long on calls, sell some puts and fucking short the ETF. Let\u2019s squeeze out the bull gang even more and drop into the recession like a rich autist!\n\nEDIT: Seems like none of y\u2019all really understand the play here. So let me explain. \nJust collect the premiums on those expensive fucking puts.\n\nEDIT: In this specific example you sell a 15$ put, hedge against it with an equal amount of shorting, and hedge against THAT with an equal amount of 3$ bought calls.\n\nThis play will net you 12$ per put/call pair.\nDo this  times 100 if you\u2019re talking per contract pair.", "created_utc": 1584514604.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fklc8x/love_for_theta_gang/", "is_self": true}
