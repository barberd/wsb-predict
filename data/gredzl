{"id": "gredzl", "title": "[$TSN] [5/27/20] \"Tyson Foods ($TSN) presents an interesting value proposition as the stock is pummeled by factory coronavirus outbreaks.\"", "selftext": "**As Tyson's operations in food production are essential and the PE remains low, now seems to be a prime time to invest in the company as they contain virus outbreaks.**\n\nTyson Foods presents itself as a compelling long-term investment in a post-coronavirus world. As the stock sits 35% off of the 52-week highs with an attractive 11.02x P/E (TTM), Tyson presents an incredible value proposition. While small outbreaks of coronavirus in some Tyson factories will result in short-term costs and operational outages, food production is essential and will prosper in the long-term environment.\nAll factories affected by the coronavirus outbreak were closed for a short period, and both have reopened. The plants were located in the state of Iowa and were involved in beef and pork production. With both of these factories open by May 5th, the stock has not rebounded yet as fears of further outbreaks and costs associated remain uncertain.\nTyson Foods, while being positioned mainly as a value investment, also has strong growth potential. The dividend has grown dramatically over the last ten years from $0.16 in 2010 to $1.54 currently at an average compound growth rate of 26%.\nTyson's status as an essential service and it's quick action to protect its workers position it as a quality long-term investment. Short-term costs associated with new procedures at facilities and closures will not have long-term impacts on the company. The low PE and dividend growth presents an enticing value opportunity as the stock trades at a considerable discount to pre-coronavirus levels.", "created_utc": 1590561232.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gredzl/tsn_52720_tyson_foods_tsn_presents_an_interesting/", "is_self": true}
