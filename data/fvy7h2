Welcome to the new trading week and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market movers and news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[Today's Top Headlines for Monday, April 6th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/06/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-monday.html)\n\n*****\n\n> * Dow futures pointed to an over 800-point gain at Monday\u2019s open as improved coronavirus data in Europe offered hope for the United States. Hints that Saudi Arabia and Russia might be close to an oil production cut deal are also helping stocks. On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 360 points, capping its third negative week in four and pushing blue chips down 28.8% from their February all-time highs. The prior week, March 23-March 27, saw the best weekly gain for the Dow since 1938. On Monday, JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon, who is recovering from heart surgery, released his widely read annual letter. \u201cWe have the resources to emerge from this crisis as a stronger country,\u201d Dimon wrote.\n\n*****\n\n> * The price of West Texas Intermediate crude was down about 2% early Monday, well off session lows of 9%. Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of Russia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund RDIF, told CNBC overnight that Moscow and Riyadh were \u201cvery close\u201d to an output reduction deal. WTI, which surged nearly 32% last week on signs of a possible Saudi-Russian agreement, remained more than 50% off its recent 52-week high in April 2019. On Sunday, President Donald Trump reiterated his threat to impose \u201cvery substantial\u201d tariffs on oil imports. But he said he does not believe he\u2019ll need to do so.\n\n*****\n\n> * Heading into what the Trump administration has characterized as the toughest week yet in the fight against the coronavirus, U.S. cases surged to over 330,000, the most of any country in the world \u2014 in fact, nearly as many as the next three countries \u2014 Italy, Spain and Germany \u2014 combined, according to Johns Hopkins University data. There have been 9,653 deaths in the U.S. Over a third of all infections and more than 40% of the deaths in America are in New York state, with New York City shouldering most of that burden. Over the weekend, Trump said 1,000 medical military personnel are deploying to New York City to help treat the overwhelming crush of coronavirus patients. Trump also expressed hope that U.S. cases may flatten soon.\n\n*****\n\n> * Global coronavirus cases increased to nearly 1.3 million with 70,355 deaths and almost 250,000 recoveries. While U.S. cases and deaths have yet to slow, Europe\u2019s hot spots are seeing signs of possibly leveling off, with Spain, Italy, Germany and France seeing death rates and new infections slowing down. Italy still has the most deaths in the world with 15,887, followed by Spain\u2019s 13,055 fatalities. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, 55, was hospitalized for tests Sunday, 10 days after contracting the coronavirus. Since Beijing first reported the outbreak in late December, The New York Times said at least 430,000 people have arrived in the U.S. on direct flights from China.\n\n*****\n\n> * Apple is designing and producing face shields for medical workers, CEO Tim Cook said in a video released Sunday. Apple is aiming to produce 1 million face shields per week. Doctors across the country have said that a shortage of personal protective equipment, like face shields and masks, puts them at risk during the COVID-19 outbreak. Cook also said Apple has donated 20 million N95 masks to organizations that need them.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/0rzY1MT.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bqio851.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/wE4myjO.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/mrxih7p.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/CiSjNJD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*($SMPL $CONN $GBX $LEVI $ANGO $RPM $SGH $LNN $MSM $SJR $WDFC $NTIC $EXFO $CAAP $SLP $TLGT)*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/R9DSwjk.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*()*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\nN/A.\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/czYmPJb.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!]()**)\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/4kzBNe8.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/gUMjuu3.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/sHtCwud.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/RHiAMQ5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/GWPlDMv.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS:\n\n* DAL\n* IMMU\n* ZM\n* LK\n* JPM\n* SQ\n* W\n* AAL\n* WORK\n* USO\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/06/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-slack-zoom-jetblue-delta-boeing-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Slack Technologies (WORK)** \u2013 The provider of the popular workplace messaging platform announced a $600 million debt offering due in 2025, convertible into cash, stock, or a combination of both depending on the holder\u2019s preference.\n\n> #**STOCK SYMBOL:** WORK\n\n> * [CLICK HERE FOR CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=WORK&ty=c&ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&p=d&s=l)\n\n> ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LIVE STOCK QUOTE!](http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/WORK)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Zoom Video Communications (ZM)** \u2013 Credit Suisse downgraded the video communications platform company to \u201cunderperform\u201d from \u201cneutral,\u201d saying the current share price reflects greater conversion to paid usage than will actually occur.\n\n> #**STOCK SYMBOL:** ZM\n\n> * [CLICK HERE FOR CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=ZM&ty=c&ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&p=d&s=l)\n\n> ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LIVE STOCK QUOTE!](http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/ZM)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **JetBlue (JBLU)** \u2013 JetBlue is burning through $10 million per day as it deals with the coronavirus outbreak, according to CEO Robin Hayes.
