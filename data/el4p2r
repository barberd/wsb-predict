Robinhood makes it difficult to execute trades and is buggy sometimes. But from what I\u2019ve seen on this sub TD can be the same way with outages and shit.

What do y\u2019all think?", "created_utc": 1578363840, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/el4p2r/tdameritrade_vs_robinhood/", "is_self": true}
