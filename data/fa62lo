Forward looking forecast by company projects virus fears will shave off $0.75 from 2020 EPS.\n\n**My View**\n\nI believe Cruise Ship Stocks have further to fall before they can mount anything remotely close to a recovery. As virus related fears continue escalating the rate of cruise and customer cancellations will continue to mount. Every new country that experiences an outbreak of the virus will lead to weary customers and softer booking rates. On Feb 12th, Royal Caribbean Cruises said \u201c There are still too many variables and uncertainties to make a reasonable forecast for 2020\u201d after already having stated the due to virus related events they are lowering 2020 EPS by $.65, but adding on that if all Asian cruises had to be cancelled they would shave off another $.55 minimum, and that\u2019s based on if they cancel Cruises through April.  Norwegian stated it expects full year EPS down $.75 per share, and said that the impact could be larger by discouraging people from booking cruises.\n\nRCL (china represents like 7% of their bookings) operates cruises out of these 9 ports in the Asia/Pacific Region:\n\nBeijing, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Tokyo, Yokohama, Singapore, Brisbane, Sydney, Perth.\n\nFor those weak on geography the first 3 cities are Chinese, the following 2 are Japanese, and the last 3 are Australian. So far, we can assume that virus fears are widespread in China, despite pooh bear clamping down virus related information spreading (in addition to falsifying infection #\u2019s). Japan was the unlucky host to the Cruise that which had the virus spread like wildfire. In addition, there are now 700 confirmed cases of the virus linked to that ship. So, I think we can assume that the virus information is widespread in japan too, and not too many people are lining up to hop on to those Cruises. Singapore while not suffering from any large outbreaks yet, still is very vulnerable. Their airport is one of the busiest in the world and their country a popular destination for many leaving them susceptible to an outbreak sometime soon. They do have 91 cases reported as well as some others that can be traced back to Singapore. Haven\u2019t really seen much about Australia, other than they are preparing for the virus (just like every other country so its not really pointing to much). However, in the context of cruises their populace is likely well aware of the Westerdam Cruise that was refused port in 5 places before finally docking in Cambodia. Looking at all this, I think its fair to say that we will keep seeing Cruise cancellations in the region and possibly even full region cancellations at least in the non-Australian cities. \n\nAdd to all this the simple fact that cruises are a luxury good and no one\u2019s going to give two shits about ditching a cruise for a full refund when their health is at stake. On top of all that if you look at the departures from Chinese airports, they have fallen a ton(Check Pictures at bottom) and I assume the impact on cruise bookings is way more significant then airline bookings/cancellations. The attachment that this virus has to the cruises is not something that's going to be easy to shake, and there's still a lot of uncertainty surrounding this virus so I think we will see further cancellations outside of the Asian region. The stock will react negatively towards those cancellations because as long as the sentiment around the industry is negative any negative sign is gonna keep pushing it down no matter how far its already fallen. The virus has a lot more places to infect and a lot more cruises to disrupt, and these stocks have a while to go before they see any semblance of a recovery. \n\nMy play is to buy puts dated at least 1-2 months out and likely going to sell some calls. RCL looks especially weak for their earnings call, I assume it\u2019ll be similar to Norwegian (good report, shitty projections) small pop followed by it heading straight down.\n\nREAL TLDR:  Learn to read you illiterate autists\n\nACTUAL TLDR: Buy puts, sell calls, subscribe to my onlyfans\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Bookings](https://preview.redd.it/jt42uhxh1ej41.png?width=964&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4c319f58aaa667a8dadbd987691d97b175be87a)\n\nFurther Reading/ Sources:\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/25/reuters-america-royal-caribbean-expects-coronavirus-outbreak-to-weigh-on-2020-profit.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/25/reuters-america-royal-caribbean-expects-coronavirus-outbreak-to-weigh-on-2020-profit.html)\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/12/norwegian-cruise-line-best-bet-among-cruise-stocks-traders.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/12/norwegian-cruise-line-best-bet-among-cruise-stocks-traders.html)\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cruise-stocks-plummet-coronavirus-hits-132801400.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cruise-stocks-plummet-coronavirus-hits-132801400.html)", "created_utc": 1582775330, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fa62lo/cruise_ship_stocks/", "is_self": true}
