So when it hit like 308, I bought and told myself that I shouldn't have to worry if sentiment starts to get bullish. To the contrary I said, SPY probably won't get rekt until everyone deeply believes that stonks will do their thing. \n\nWith FED always pushing 10min before EOD and boomers too stupid to manage their money I now sense a very bullish sentiment and I can feel God trying peel off my gayness. In the books this should be great, because in my logic markets will die soon. But in reality I sweat into my paper hands. \n\nTherefore, please maximize my worries about my positions to vaccinate me. \nAlso post better put entries you got, to remind me of my incompetence. \n\nThank you, gay bear out.\n\ntl;dr make me feel bad about my puts", "created_utc": 1583372434, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fdnovc/make_me_feel_bad_about_my_puts/", "is_self": true}
