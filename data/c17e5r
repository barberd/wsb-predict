Too many of you have Beyond Meat (BYND) FOMO.", "selftext": "I\u2019ve been seeing a lot of posts here lately trying to find the next Beyond Meat\u2122 and all of them are Beyond Retarded\u2122. \n\nFOMO investing does not work.\n\nYou will lose money. Stop chasing IPOs because all of these companies are honestly shit. Yes I\u2019m talking about CRWD, FVRR, and CHWY. \n\nIf you want a good IPO then at least wait for something like Spotify or Impossible. Holy shit, not a fucking dog food e-tailer.\n\nSo calm your tits with these IPOs guys.
