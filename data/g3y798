Sold July 130 calls too early. Will continue to ride this but up huge in the last few weeks so may sell some additional out of the money calls.\n\nAM (Antero Midstream) update. Bounced from mid 2s to mid 3s as a 30.75 cent dividend will be paid in early May. Thinking that this may move higher still. As noted previously, this is not a typical WSB play, but due to the low price, potential short squeeze and dividend \u201csecured\u201d, the upside is option-like.\n\nTLDR, Buy AM, Inverse WSB Bears", "created_utc": 1587255854.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g3y798/wsb_sentiment_roku_and_am/", "is_self": true}
