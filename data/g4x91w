If it has a HUGE jump and it is still well below your average share price you can just buy back that call for some immediate small loss. \n\n\nOf course this is assuming you have the cash to back up any margin call.", "created_utc": 1587404025.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g4x91w/selling_covered_calls_with_margin/", "is_self": true}
