Reducing meat consumption is objectively healthier even though the meat industry has done a good job of clouding this topic with bs science and myths. Meat is insanely resource intensive which we are running out of. Tax payers heavily subsidize meat industry.\nBYND earnings 10/28. It is heavily shorted, probably by you fuckers. Has a high valuation. Might get a another short squeeze jump next week. \nAll around it seems like a similar story as pot stocks.\nI am not a vegan or vegetarian but bring your vegan trash talking anyway.", "created_utc": 1572013646, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dmy7my/long_or_short_alternative_meats_bynd_same_story/", "is_self": true}
