The issue is that Puerto Rico\u2019s nonprofits register their status locally and not with the IRS, which technically means they are not 501(c)(3). This runs against Congress\u2019 intent for most charitable nonprofits, with up to 500 employees, to qualify for this program. Nonprofits in our territories cannot be left out of this program because of this technicality. The SBA should consider evidence in determining 501(c)(3) eligibility that considers nonprofit organizations or entities that are organized or doing business under State law. Will the SBA address this issue in guidance?\n\n**This in tandem with the SBA applications being routed to a third party non-governmental vendor (making the information no longer \"public domain\" and shielded from FOIA requests) would provide excellent cover for shell corporations/not-for-profits out of Puerto Rico to funnel SBA relief funds into their coffers and away from small businesses.**", "created_utc": 1587071339.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2npc1/small_business_association_sba_loans_embezzlement/", "is_self": true}
