I love this sub so much so thanks for being hilarious, retarded, smart, autistic and everything in between. Today I just wanted to share my perspective on a where we stand in the market. I'll start by saying I'm not an expert, I'm a business person in his thirties who has built his business from nothing to being a multi million dollar revenue business.\n\n**\"Be fearful when others are greedy\" - When I look at the market today I see a whole lot of greed.** On March 20th to 23rd the bears were greedy ( I was one of them and I've learned my lesson) but now I can say that I think the bulls are getting greedy.\n\n**\"Buy the rumor, sell the news\"** \\- I was looking at back at what was the exact day that I closed my stores because of Covid and the date was Mar. 20th. Just a few day before my province (I'm in Canada) made it mandatory. This also happened to be the same time that the market was bottoming. If I had been smart as a bear I would've bought the rumor that businesses were going to shut down (by buying puts) and sold the news when the businesses actually closed (by selling my puts and going long).\n\nHindsight is 20/20 as they say but I'm not going to make this mistake again. I think today we can put buy the rumor and sell the news to our advantage again. I believe that the second half of this rally has been investors buying the rumor that we're going to start slowly reopening the economy. I don't know if you guys saw the link below but based on this MIT model and honestly just common sense IMHO I just don't see how we reopen without having a second surge. Alternatively we don't reopen and the economy will be hit even more.\n\n[http://news.mit.edu/2020/new-model-quantifies-impact-quarantine-measures-covid-19-spread-0416](http://news.mit.edu/2020/new-model-quantifies-impact-quarantine-measures-covid-19-spread-0416)\n\n**Even when we do reopen it won't be at full capacity.** As the owner of several retail stores I would love to believe more than anyone that once we start reopening there will be so much pent up demand and we will be back to normal before we know it. I just don't see it! For my business we plan to bring staff back in stages because it wouldn't be wise of us to bring everyone back all at once. Realistically a good 25% of my staff won't be brought back.\n\n**Businesses can't pay their bills.** We're a small business that was both quite lean and conservatively ran and yet we owe vendors thousands of dollars that we just don't have. This has to do with the cyclical nature of the golf business (buy a bunch of golf clubs in the late winter, sell them in the spring / summer) but still I'm sure there are literally millions of business that owe bigger businesses money and when that starts to rear its ugly head in the numbers it ain't going to be pretty.\n\nI especially see greed in the technology sector. I know that obviously the FAANG's are the ones owe stand to come out the best on the other side of this but I also know that the market tends to overshoot to the downside and to the upside. I was fine with QQQ's valuation until the end of last week. You mean to tell me that 8% down from the already overvalued ATH's we were at is a fair valuation? I get the lesser of two evils idea that there are very few places to park your money right now that are safe but I still think we're over extended on the QQQ.\n\nRealistically the market could go up a BIT from here given the momentum but I don't see a world where we see spy break through 300. I would have short positions right now and put more in as we hit 290, 295 and then go all in a 300.\n\nPositions: PTON 32p 05/15, SPCE 15p 05/15, [XIU.TO](https://xiu.to/) 23.5p 05/15, EEM 43p 06/19, IWM 130p 06/19, [XIU.TO](https://xiu.to/) 23.50p 06/19, EEM 40p 06/30, QQQ 215p 07/17, FXI 45p 08/21", "created_utc": 1587327179.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g4ej2c/be_fearful_when_others_are_greedy_and_other/", "is_self": true}
