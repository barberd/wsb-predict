Price action shows a hint of recovery and a nice flag formation and could test resistance levels set 2 weeks ago. I\u2019d like to see it squeeze up but that a fucking fool's native optimistic view. Look for price to test $43.64 in the coming weeks. Could be trading sideways for now but price action and direction will gain more clarity after the Trumponomics at G20 on 28 June 2019. Waiting on the sidelines for now, but if it breaks through $43.64, I'll be in pursuit of superior returns on this ticker.", "created_utc": 1559926215, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bxwvto/fl_gained_today_hint_of_a_squeeze_up_early_in/", "is_self": true}
