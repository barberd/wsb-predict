{"id": "fyko4a", "title": "DD: America is so much more screwed than they think", "selftext": "The optimism on wall st/main st/wh is disingenuous at best, and also terribly dangerous to see from both a public POV and health policy perspective. \n\nOutside of the painfully obvious inadequacy of the American healthcare system. I want to bring up another example worth looking at: South Korea - one of the best-prepared nations on earth is bracing for a second wave (https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/south-koreas-return-to-normal-interrupted-by-uptick-in-coronavirus-cases/ar-BB12bDaj) \n\nAnd to give you an IDEA of how prepared the South Koreans are. Let's look at some examples: \n\n- Every citizen gets a text if there is any confirmed nearby, they will receive an alert just like an amber alert. Also, the citizens who have received positively for COVID are forced to agree to share their location anonymously with the govt so that people can be careful when going to these specific locations. I\u2019m talking about they can track what stores they stopped by, what bus they took etc\n\n- Korea allowed people to enter Korea and their # of confirmed cases shot up to ~100 per day (it was below 50 a day) and they now have implemented a law where if a person who entered Korea recently and was confirmed positive or was told to self-quarantine does not self-quarantine, they either have to pay a crazy fine like 10,000 dollars. Actually, one of the foreigners got deported because he was wandering around everywhere though he was told to be self-quarantined cuz of his COVID test results.\n\n\nThis is the amount of effort it takes to handle COVID properly and we're not even seeing 5% of this in any major US city. And all of this is occurring in Korea, which has one of the BEST medical systems in the world. \n\n\nThe amount of infrastructure that is built just to handle COVID cases in Korea is insanely well built, but even then, Korea has not fully returned to the normal state of the economy after 2-3 months now. The US did not do anything nowhere close to it and expects to open by May? That's pure rubbish. \n\n--- \n\nhttp://ncov.mohw.go.kr/en - this is the Korean website that shows COVID situations", "created_utc": 1586540835.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fyko4a/dd_america_is_so_much_more_screwed_than_they_think/", "is_self": true}
