The S&P hit all time highs at 339. Everyone was making tendies. Finally, after having diamond hands, our 3/20 200c MSFT start to print. All was good.\n\n2/20/20. Massive selling happened midday. Autists were confused. We rallied back later in the afternoon. BTFD. SPY closed from 337.74 to 336.95.\n\n2/21/20. SPY opened 335.47. SPY closed 333.48. It's Friday. Didn't you know autist? Friday's for the past 3 weeks have sold off before rallying. Monday is going to bounce, then power up through the week to new highs. BTFD.\n\n***If you haven't realized it yet, the MM already have made their first move.***\n\n**2 - Bc4**\n\nIn my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffh9cd/why_volatility_is_here_to_stay_the_market_will/), I described the fastest correction since the 2008 financial crisis, why volatility is here to stay. I also describe exactly why we started to be **range bound between 313.84 and 284.82** after the selling climax and the Fed's emergency 50 bps point cut.\n\n[SPY 1 Yr\\/1 D](https://preview.redd.it/385fc7sraxl41.png?width=2104&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc95310e0f63605c114dc428da8c17e2df0f68f6)\n\n2/28/20 Friday. After dropping for almost an entire week straight, we reach near the 2019 October low, shorts cover heavily, and we pump back up to the 250% retracement at 293.15. All is good, just a beer virus. JPow is going to save us!\n\n[SPY 10 D\\/30 min](https://preview.redd.it/50gm1e7gexl41.png?width=2104&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5c97bfe05ac03c7384eebac0b4599ed0236bec7)\n\n3/2/20 Monday. After making some solid gains, the Fed announced emergency cuts. We rally for 30 min. We're still staying in this uptrend channel. Seems like we made some new resistance at 285.\n\n[SPY 5 D\\/15 min + overlaid with SPY 1 Yr\\/1 D, volume indicator, and RSI](https://preview.redd.it/cgrccro6gxl41.png?width=1986&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f89a65a6b63ea92c549ec4204def51a68e3f2d1)\n\n3/6/20 Friday. All indications suggested that we were nearing the bottom of the channel at 285 to retest the lows and start forming the bottom or base. RSI was below <40 consistently, volume was slowing on the selling side. On this day, we entered extremely oversold territory.\n\nLike clockwork, at 3:30 pm EST, shorts start covering heavily as indicated by that large number of white candles in the bottom right corner. It's going to be alright, we are going to get our YUGE rally on Monday like last time. Wait. Like last time? Like on Friday 2/28/20?\n\n***If you haven't realized it yet, the MM have already made their second move.***\n\n**3 - Qh5**\n\n[SPY 10 D\\/30 min](https://preview.redd.it/rz5srd0uhxl41.png?width=2098&format=png&auto=webp&s=097544b835ba4b59b2641d64836b6fad956d2d55)\n\n3/9/20 Monday. Futures in during the night limit down. No matter what, everyone with calls at open is absolutely screwed over. The 7% circuit breaker quickly follows 4 min in trading.\n\nAs I previously stated on 3/5/20, Sunday, when I made my first post:\n\n>Due to this uncertainty and with additional bad news expected over the weekend, I believe we are going to still face more downside as we close near the 285, before having another large rally to the upside.\n\nPeople are panicking, people are buying puts, puts, and more puts. Surely it will hit the 20% circuit breaker today, if not sometime this week? We end the day at a lower low.\n\n>Retest of the -5% at the previous 285 was rejected. Ended lower than -7% circuit breaker and even below the August 2019 low at 273.09, creating a sign of weakness. Larger sell volume present in the final hours of trading. Most likely going to continue to the downside, but still expecting a bounce which will be used to shake out people holding their puts.\n\n***If you haven't realized it yet, the MM already have made their third move.***\n\n[3\\/9\\/20 Options sales on SPX](https://preview.redd.it/9fix47h5jxl41.png?width=2788&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8571ae5356e1b666b2cd4001b602456970bcba0)\n\nClosely after the 7% circuit breaker, MM were buying tens of thousands of SPX calls. Look at some of them and their price. What about treasury bonds at an all time high? Note that many of these were bought around 2 or 3 pm.\n\n[3\\/9\\/20 Options sales on TLT](https://preview.redd.it/09jtvhfzjxl41.png?width=2788&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a2d889a81636eb6be80aef630c0cd8c858578ca)\n\n>Another contrarian indicator given the price on Friday action. Even though we have hit -5% in /ES and passed 2850, there's actually tens of thousands of puts OTM purchased on TLT during Friday. Now that begets the question, if treasuries are the safe haven asset as more people are selling \\[equities, which should drive up TLT prices\\], then who is buying these puts?\n\n**4 - Qxf7**\n\n[SPY 5 D\\/5 min](https://preview.redd.it/n04az9b7lxl41.png?width=1444&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8d10013cba8c3f160fa37e1c676ec053852229d)\n\n3/10/20 Tuesday. Futures during the night limit up. Anyone who bought puts yesterday are screwed. Calls, autists, buy more calls! Bear r fuk!\n\nWe start plummeting to retest our new low of 270.27, stopping just short of the June 2019 low at 273.09. Bull r fuk! Suddenly, we start rallying. It's the Fed. Pump JPow, pump it harder! And just like that, we are back into our 285-315 bounded trading range.\n\nHang on autists. Aren't a lot of drops on Monday? I keep hearing black Monday. We got a nice rally on Tuesday. Well, we are back in our trading range, things should be okay. 285 should be our lower resistance. Lot of people watching these charts seem to agree. Has this happened before?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f62bup1llxl41.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=a21446d89e7a2d638825bcdb8fc01935dd539119\n\nWhat's going to happen tomorrow on Wednesday? Well...\n\n***If you haven't realized it yet, the MM already have made their fourth move.***\n\n[3\\/10\\/20 SPX options sales](https://preview.redd.it/mcog9fz9nxl41.png?width=2784&format=png&auto=webp&s=3df2ce64d818f79814f73e023c23db9a6cea9386)\n\nNotice the large amounts of calls early in the morning. This was right before the low at 11:30 am this Tuesday.\n\nNow look at the insane amounts of **0DTE FD puts for March 11 tomorrow.** Just for reference, 5000 SPX FD puts for tomorrow at a premium of 22.70 is $11,350,000. There are more than >60,000 of these puts.\n\nWhat about treasuries? Notice those massive amounts of puts purchased right before 11 today morning before the rally back to 285. Now notice how many calls were bought right before close today.\n\n[3\\/10\\/20 TLT](https://preview.redd.it/6qoj7tzwnxl41.png?width=2784&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bc90ff9c0274baae08feaedd9370fdad9af4494)\n\n**tl;dr Tomorrow is going to be a blood bath which has been set up for almost 2 weeks now by MM. Checkmate autists.**\n\n3/10/20 Update 1 - Futures down already -1.5% at 8pm est.\n\nI'll update more on why tomorrow was chosen. MM were already planning contingency plans or splitting up trading teams in different areas last week. Also, the college aged children of these MM most likely got notifications that universities were closing this week. People at Morgan Stanley and Barclays also have gotten sick from coronavirus. National guard deployed in NY. It hit close to home.\n\nJust a quick edit. Every single firm has done their own internal calculation of number of cases in the USA already and how quickly it will spread. Most MM agree  the market will go down significantly more. They are taking advantage of the vol to take as much money from people as they can.", "created_utc": 1583884431.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fgnqbh/was_the_circuit_breaker_on_monday_an_engineered/", "is_self": true}
