Now a new Intel chip vulnerability nicknamed \u201cZombieLoad\u201d has been\u00a0revealed to the public, and though it\u2019s already being patched by three major operating system makers, there\u2019s some bad news: full protection could reduce your CPU\u2019s performance by up to 40%.\nIn a just-published\u00a0support document,\u00a0Apple suggests that full ZombieLoad mitigation will require Intel chip users to disable Intel\u2019s hyper-threading processing feature \u2014 a major selling point of the chipmaker\u2019s CPUs. During testing this month, Apple says that it found \u201cas much as a 40 percent reduction in performance with tests that include multithreaded workloads and public benchmarks,\u201d though actual performance impacts will vary between machines.\nGoogle and Microsoft (via\u00a0TechCrunch) have also started the process of patching their Intel-based operating systems. In\u00a0Google\u2019s case, Chrome OS devices have already received some protections and will receive more in the next OS release; Intel-only Android devices are rare, but will receive OS patches once device makers deploy them. Microsoft is releasing\u00a0patches\u00a0for Windows today, and has already protected Azure users. Some microcode processor updates will come from Microsoft directly, and others from device makers.\nThe ZombieLoad issue was apparently disclosed to Intel one month ago, and impacts all Intel processors produced since 2011. Chips from AMD and ARM are not believed to be susceptible to this flaw. According to vendors, there are no known real-world exploits of the vulnerability at this point, though the researchers simply say that they don\u2019t know if it\u2019s been abused in the wild.\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/venturebeat.com/2019/05/14/intel-zombieload-flaw-forces-os-patches-with-up-to-40-performance-hits/amp/", "created_utc": 1557894170, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bot90h/intel_zombieload_flaw_forces_os_patches_with_up/", "is_self": true}
