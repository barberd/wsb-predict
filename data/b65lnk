Credit card incremental but small impact for Apple\n\nApple's Services reveal was materially different than we had anticipated. \n\n\u2022The Apple TV+ service which we expected to be available now was only previewed for Fall availability with no pricing information. \n\n\u2022An Apple Card credit card offer was announced for Summer availability with attractive spending tracking features but our calculations again imply little short term earnings impact for Apple. \n\n\u2022Apple also previewed an Arcade gaming subscription service but again for Fall availability with no pricing information. \n\n\u2022The News service announced was as we had expected and is the only Service announced that is available immediately. \n\n\u2022Apple offered no Services bundle to compel users to sign up now though this is still a possibility for the actual launch this Fall. \n\nThough all of these services are interesting from a platform churn point of view none seem likely on our calculations to materially impact EPS in the short term, with the possible exception of Apple Arcade pending pricing and service details", "created_utc": 1553700021, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b65lnk/goldman_sachs_on_apple_inc_aapl/", "is_self": true}
