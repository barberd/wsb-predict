Victoria's Secret parent company, L Brands (LB), might strike a deal with another company by next week. \n\nTons of call buying between 18-20 strikes for 12/13 exp. These are yolo weeklies that might actually make you guys tendies. \n\nOther stupid reasons to buy LB:\n\n1) You guys secretly love buying bras to wear at home\n\n2) For the ones that do have girlfriends (you're probably lying), you probably buy them expensive lingerie because you think you're cool\n\n3) L Brands also owns Bath and Body Works and everyone I know uses their scented soap.\n\n4) What do I know... I'm red for the year and for my lifetime return but I'm buying 12/13 calls so I can finally redeem myself!\n\nWhat do you fellow autists think?", "created_utc": 1575616114, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e6va5a/victorias_secret_is_wsbs_secret/", "is_self": true}
