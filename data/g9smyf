{"id": "g9smyf", "title": "Abbott's Cavalier Approach to COVID Antibody Testing Will Work", "selftext": "As states push toward re-opening, demand for COVID antibody tests will rocket into the stratosphere. The urgency of this need will be met with an exorbitant price tag. Abbott has already secured [EAU](https://www.medtechdive.com/news/abbott-diasorin-coronavirus-antibody-tests-get-euas-as-lawmakers-question/576794/) for its COVID antibody test while industry leaders remain [complacent](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/covid-19-antibody-testing-a-disaster-says-roche-ceo-as-its-diagnostics-sales-rise). The fact that this development resulted in minimal price movement reflects uncertainty that Abbott can deliver on the scale of its rivals. In this climate of urgency, their \"shoot first ask questions later\" approach to COVID antibody testing will be the winning one.\n\nAbbott has never been considered the industry leader in diagnostic testing. Quarterly diagnostic revenue was only up 0.7% in Q1, the weakest organic performance of their 4 branches. Abbott's ARCHITECT, the flagship of their diagnostic fleet, is a relatively high throughput serology platform that already has a place in many hospitals and state laboratories. They are currently charging over $100 for each COVID antibody test, which is an order of magnitude higher than their other antibody tests. The price point is also uniform, meaning they will charge public labs full price. I suspect that state governments will happily turn over grant money to subsidize testing as their constituents continue to demand seroprevalence surveys and back-to-work initiatives. Better yet, there won't be any public outcry over price-gouging because the IgG test is not used to diagnose active infections in sick patients.\n\nI expect the antibody test hype train to be running at full steam in about a month's time. By then, the positive Q2 results will probably be priced in. Therefore, I will be going in on June monthlies rather than waiting until August for an earnings play. \n\nAs a bonus, there will probably be a jump in RHHBY when they announce their antibody test in early May as they throw caution to the wind and join ABT at the table (no options chain tho, RIP)\n\nTLDR: Abbott is Best in Wild West Contest for Antibody Test.
