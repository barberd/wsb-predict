That's the catalyst for the calls increased stock value.\n\n**Risks -** \n\n* $2.1B in investing activities in 2019 (Almost all of this looks to represents Currency Swaps)\n* $830M in Investment hedges\n* $2.3B for a revolving credit line available... looking into how much they've used\n* a 10% reduction in either the Chinese Renminbi or the Euro versus the U.S. Dollar would lower annual operating income by approximately $40M and $25M, respectively\n* Oxygen sales likely to only impact their bottom line by a few percentage  points, guessing 1-2% increased sale volume.\u00a0 Unlikely they will be able to significantly increase prices due to government pressures.\u00a0 \\*Likely will extract tax concessions at least this is what I'd ask for as the CEO with potential price restrictions.\n\n**Good notes**\n\n* Reduced total debt from $3.8B to $3.3B in 2019\n* Dividend of 2.6%\n* Only $367M of debt due in 2020\n* A 1% increase/decrease in the effective tax rate would decrease/increase net income by approximately $23M\n* Air Products represents $1.7B of their income\n* Global presence\n\nBuying calls earlier could be considered with a rapid  increase in Corona patients. \n\n\\*NOTE I HAVE NO POSITIONS in the STOCK and won't at least until 3/23 as I watch the market burn.", "created_utc": 1584290412.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fj44en/apd_air_products_and_chemicals_a_bull_call_play/", "is_self": true}
