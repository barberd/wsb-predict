Any mention of her clothing items are preceded with the cost and that they were acquired at the Maxx. For example:\n\nMe: I like those jeans.\nHer: Thanks! $6, TJ Maxx.\n\nLong story short is to long TJX, not to short them, because they have good deals on shorts and other things like long dresses and short skirts.", "created_utc": 1566304324, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/csxztw/heavy_dd_on_tj_maxx/", "is_self": true}
