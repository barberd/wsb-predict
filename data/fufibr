{"id": "fufibr", "title": "Who's Selling?", "selftext": "We all know who's buying, between brrrr and stimulus. But who's selling at this level? The bears seem to think that with each bit of bad news (employment numbers, etc.), the stock market just magically moves to a lower number. That's not how markets work. This isn't the same as betting on a sporting event where there is a timed outcome.\n\nSo my question is, who's selling? The thing about the JFK shoeshine story is that it was relevant both during 01 and 08. Every taxi driver or janitor was either in tech stocks in 00 or had multiple homes in 07. They had to sell. But since the inequality divide has gotten worse, the holders of equity are more top 10% earners who don't need to sell. These are the people who believe \"it's only a loss if you sell, I learned that in 08\". \n\nOf course folks who are overleveraged need to sell. When we first legged down hedge funds and trading firms blew up. When oil mini-crashed more hedge funds and trading firms blew up. But here, around 240-250 SPY and 20 oil, who's selling?\n\nSure, this thing could last for a long time and transform the economy as we know it. But I think that would be the catalyst for the next wave of selling. But bad employment numbers and other things that have already happened are not causing boomers to sell. The lesson they learned in 08 was that it's still a great investment if you're looking 10+ years out.\n\nI haven't entered into any positions yet, but I think near term IC are good, and all those 4/17 puts and calls at new lows and highs are gonna be worthless.", "created_utc": 1585944633.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fufibr/whos_selling/", "is_self": true}
