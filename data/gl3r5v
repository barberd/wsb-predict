{"id": "gl3r5v", "title": "NVAX", "selftext": "So like everyone else who follows the market, I\u2019m sure that you\u2019ve seen that NVAX is up by 120% this week. The average trader would think something along the lines of, \u201cthat\u2019s way too much growth, time to buy puts.\u201d And in normal times with a normal company this would be right, but right now this is the worst thing to do.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze MRNA before I explain why you should be buying calls on NVAX. MRNA\u2019s market cap at the beginning of the year was sitting at about 6 billion, but ever since they\u2019ve started their COVID vaccine development, they\u2019ve added 18 BILLION to their market cap. They don\u2019t have animal studies for their COVID vaccine, they don\u2019t even have phase 1 results for their COVID vaccine. They are using a technology that has never produced a vaccine for any disease ever. Yet they got nearly a half a billion dollars in federal funding, quadrupling their market cap. They also have 311 million outstanding shares, which is a little less than 6 times as many as NVAX.\n\nNVAX market cap was sitting at around 150 million on December 31, and today they\u2019re at around 2.5 billion. They received 388 million in funding from CEPI, an organization consisting of many countries, and that\u2019s where you saw the huge run up on Monday. They only have 58 million outstanding shares, so a similar 18 million market cap increase would put their share price on the hundreds.\n\nNVAX on Friday saw a 20% spike in price, seemingly for no reason between open and 12:40. Why? Trump was in a press conference, and it was leaked that he was going to announce the 6 American companies that are going to receive blank checks (tens of billions if not hundreds) to develop the vaccine. When he ended up not announcing, prices dipped immediately, not just for NVAX but for MRNA and INO too. \n\nIt looks like insider sentiment believes that NVAX is going to receive funding. They don\u2019t even need to make a successful vaccine, if they receive the funding, the price will jump to $60+ almost immediately. You aren\u2019t betting on them making a vaccine, you\u2019re betting on Trump funding a vaccine with billions of dollars to boost his re-election chances, and that\u2019s a safe bet. \n\nThere have been other small leaks that they are going to be confirmed as well such as the head of research for NVAX praising Trump for Operation Warp Speed and committing to vaccinate America first. Send me screenshots of your tendies in a month.\n\nPositions: 7/17 NVAX 50  7/17 NVAX 45", "created_utc": 1589668193.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gl3r5v/nvax/", "is_self": true}
