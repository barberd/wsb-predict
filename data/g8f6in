However, the money I do have in robinhood has been trapped in there for months because I reversed a transfer. Basically, my transfer request initiated twice (instead of one order of $1000, it sent two orders of $1000 each). I reversed one of those transfers to get some money back in my pocket and those thieves at Robinhood froze my account because of it. I have emailing them several times a week asking them to lift the restriction but nobody has done anything. This has been going on for about 3 months. Has anyone else had to deal with this shit? Or am I just extremely lucky", "created_utc": 1587911141.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g8f6in/robinhood_places_restrictions_on_my_account_now_i/", "is_self": true}
