There will be many upsets next month. Let me preface by saying I will never vote for Bernie Sanders. The wealth tax is fake, Sanders' version of M4A without said tax is so disastrous, and his rhetoric is based on hate. I loved 2016 Sanders, 2020 Sanders is delusional.  \n\nBut listen my sweet sweet autist: **Sanders will get a full swoop and you'll be wishing you had puts on American healthcare.** Iowa might lean Biden, but New Hampshire is an easy Sanders win. Polls are conducted mostly through landline, and only white boomerz have landlines these days. Younger people turn out more every year, and polls never properly account for that, that will be especially true this year.     The media has galvanized the left against Trump and Bernie is, unfortunately, the default for most young people who dont know actually know shit about healthcare or the economy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also think Yang could be one of the biggest black swans for the market this century if he does well in Iowa, keep yer eye out. My question is which companies stand the most to lose under a Sanders Admin? UNH, XLV bearish spreads? I'd aim for Feb 14 or March 6\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFuck the ted talk joke", "created_utc": 1580340570, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/evvgiu/democratic_primary_dd_iowa_in_5_days/", "is_self": true}
