Here's a few\n\n- Autonomous driving has a massive bubble. It's insanely difficult to make it work in every lighting and weather conditions. Alphabet's Waymo has the best track record and is the clear tech leader. Elon Musk is way too optimistic as always and ignoring lidars is dumb.\n- Thermal cameras are severely undervalued, as they are still a bit expensive and low res. FLIR is the market leader. Make your conclusions.\n- Low cost lidars are going to make the robotics business financially viable, but it's unclear who wins the race. Big bubble here as well. Not many plays you can make on the stock market.\n\nFrom tech overall\n\n- Would not buy or hold Microsoft. Their tech is mostly garbage.\n- AMD is right now leading the race (Threadrippers CPUs are absolute monsters, Intel has a severe vulnerability again), but the tables are turning every couple of years.
