I didn\u2019t put enough in them though to justify a gain post.\n\nYou never go broke taking profits, but I\u2019m still going to hold on to the LEAPs because of how long term they are and I believe we still have room to run.\n\nEdit- this screenshot/gains info was from Friday but took forever to get approved for whatever reason, but they\u2019ve all moved up since then.", "created_utc": 1591665844.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gzczaj/dd_post_gains_update/", "is_self": true}
