It will be OTM put. As far as needed for it to cost $100. I want to buy it right before earnings.\nIf earnings will be positive then I lost $100.\nIf earning are negative and price goes $20 down then in theory I would make 400% not taking into account IV crash. How much IV crash will make damage?\nBecause I would risk 100 to make 300-400 but risking 100 to make 100 doesn't cost that", "created_utc": 1571773443, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dln8dd/how_much_damage_iv_crash_does_after_earnings/", "is_self": true}
