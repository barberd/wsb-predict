{"id": "d2flp8", "title": "AIMT Peanut \"Update\"", "selftext": "If yall followed my last post you'd know that you'd be up 60% since Monday.\n\nToday's your last chance to either crash or moon on AIMT before the briefing documents come out.  (This friday is the actual meeting though)\n\nDD\n\nEfficacy: It works. Touching a peanut, won't kill you anymore for most kids.  4-17  You can even eat a little bit like a bite of peanut butter sandwich.\n\nSafety shmafety:  You got more systemic allergic reactions, sure, but you at least know where it's coming from and you got your epi\n\nThis drug is to protect kids from unintentional ingestion of peanuts.   Yea, that kid that died because he was on the same slide as a kid munching on trail mix?  No more.  First kiss cause you death cause she kissed another boy eating peanuts?  Enough.\n\nKnow how many kids are deathly allergic to peanuts?  Like a million in the USA.  You charge 10k per year for this you got 10bil in rev.  30% will likely come off cause it causes side effects.  You got DBVT's peanut patch competitor on the horizon.  Another 50% of that.  Take off another 50% just because and you still got 1.75b.\n\nCurrent market cap is 1.37b.\n\nBruh, you do the math.  Nothing on the market currently for peanut allergy and AIMT got egg allergy in the pipe.\n\nI'mma lay my pipe how you think it is.  Due to IV it may make more sense to not buy Options at this point as the 25 strikes are now already $2.00.  Lookin at a positive advisory committee post price of 28.  30s might be a bit too optimistic but it has hit this before.\n\nGood luck autists\n\nOh yea, the briefing docs could reveal something shitty.  Just FYI  can't predict this shit.", "created_utc": 1568153836, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d2flp8/aimt_peanut_update/", "is_self": true}
