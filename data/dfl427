Should I post their responses to my secure messages dealing with the issue here and have /wsb decide what I say back?", "selftext": "It was a 401k account I haven't touched out of laziness, it was just sitting in an ETF around $5000, was suddenly just drained down to $0 for no reason, probably was hacked.
