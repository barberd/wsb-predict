Is biohazard cleaning something that would be done by existing janitorial staff, or will there be a need to bring in speciality cleaning services? Once the bodies start piling up and everyone\u2019s working from home, can you really tell the normal cleaning crew to go around the office with Clorox wipes? \n\nEven if it is the normal cleaners, I\u2019m sure protocols are going to be stepped up massively for more frequent, more thorough cleanings. So that could mean a lot more billable hours.\n\nServiceMaster came up in my 5 minutes of DD on this, but most of their revenue comes from Terminix. Just had a massive drop on slightly missed earnings, so they could be a good play regardless. But I\u2019m really wondering if there\u2019s a publicly traded company that specializes in decontamination for healthcare settings. I work in a hospital but this is way outside my lane, so I\u2019ll ask coworkers tomorrow if no one here has suggestions.", "created_utc": 1583692647.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffgsy9/covid_cleaning_companies/", "is_self": true}
