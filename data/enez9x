{"id": "enez9x", "title": "At what account balance does Theta Gang membership become viable?", "selftext": "I graduated college a few years ago and have amassed a little over $200k in investments. I spent my formative years over in r/FIRE and r/investing, luckily only discovering this sub recently.  \n\nBut I've grown bored with index investing so now I'm here to gain and lose more. I want to sell put spreads on SPX once a week, 30-45 DTE.  Short put will be in the 30-40 Delta range.  Buy back or roll at 50% profit, and stomach losses when they come and only make minor cost basis reductions.  \n\nI basically just want to leverage my relatively large position (for a mid-20 year old at least) with a defined-risk strategy.  I'd start off deploying around $2k per month, to try to net \\~$700 (if you check put prices now, this math might not work because IV is so low).  The other $200k will stay invested.  On the inevitable years that my losses are amplified, I'll still aim to invest $40k in my other accounts that track the S&amp;P at a 0.95+ correlation.  I think on a high level, it's similar to creating a slightly leveraged S&amp;P ETF, although it's only leveraged by a few percent a year and sideways trading will help instead of hurting (although I'll admit, I don't know all the nuances of leveraged ETFs).  Buffet supposedly has taken in billions selling puts on indexes, but I hear he writes naked and did it back in 2008.  \n\nObvious risks/drawbacks I'm aware of are:  IV expansion will hurt (premiums are really bad now), I'm considering starting near market ATH (probably irrelevant but someone will point it out), and it's very tax inefficient in a brokerage account.  \n\nWhat would you do if you were me?  I prefer to stay on the selling side.  I've considered covered calls, but I don't like the idea of capping profits while I'm still in the accumulation phase.", "created_utc": 1578784171, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/enez9x/at_what_account_balance_does_theta_gang/", "is_self": true}
