For starters, your dumbass probably has never heard of NVIDIA. Who's NVIDIA? That gaming company? Jesus christ have you ever thought about what makes our newfound digital life possible?!, they provide a lot more than just gaming cheepz for the 144hz refresherrz. Not to discount the fact that they do...*** ***~~and they're also the best at that. (Also, won't be covering in this post, but they also have a huge hand in self-driving cars. Look it up.)~~***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAside from games, they are the company that drives almost every Professional Artists' workhorse. I'm talking PHOTOGRAPHERS and VIDEOGRAPHERS that take & edit your wife's nudes & pornos. I'm talking about what APPLE uses to power their machines, who are widely recognized by many to be the BEST CREATIVE tool in the markets. I'm talking about what DIGITAL ARTISTS use to draw up KILLER RENDERINGS of FAKE BEARS to trick your dumbass into buying PUTS. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh, they power ADOBE TOO?! The company that also has a monopoly in pre and post-process editing and content creation down to full blown 3d renderings? Jesus fucking christ. \"But wait, those programs are so hard to use and learn, they have a big barrier to entry and will never become mainstream.\" You're right. Kinda. Fucking boomer. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**If only there was some way to tackle that.... The only way this could get any better was if they created a unified cloud platform that allowed these new students and existing practitioners a platform to connect and edit together instead of watching 5HRs worth of YouTube tutorials....**  Holy shit?! They just announced the Omniverse? WTF IS AN OMNIVERSE? I'll let NVIDIA explain:\n\n[\"Omniverse aims for universal interoperability across different applications and 3D ecosystem vendors. It provides efficient real-time scene updates and is based on open-standards and protocols. The Omniverse Platform is designed to act as a hub, enabling new capabilities to be exposed as micro-services to any connected clients and applications.\"](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-omniverse-platform)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince I know you probably can't comprehend that, think of a google doc where you and all your little friends can see what work the other person is doing, while editing, in real time. This platform will, with no doubt, change the ENTIRE WAY that 3D artists and products operate.. making workflows faster, more efficient, and overall more enjoyable. What does this mean? They will hold a MONOPOLY over what is the future of our marketing assets, visual art outputs, and any game that shows up on a screen. To put this metaphorically- **This company has built the engine, installed it in all the cars, and has now paved the roads on which you will drive it on,**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow that you are aware, I want to let you know that this company is reporting EARNINGS after-hours TODAY. I forget exactly where, possibly in my fucking dreams, but they were recently upgraded to a target price of $450. The market just tanked a bit as I was typing this (hahaha), but they are currently at $355. Their revenue is UNTOUCHED by COVID. IF anything, they will BEAT EXPECTATIONS BIGLY because every little boy and little girl decided to buy GPUS to power their PornHub Machines and Instagram Editors. Now go make some money so your wife will look at you again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR; BUY NVIDIA  CALLS NOW BEFORE IT EXPLODES TOMORROW $NVDA 400C 5/29**", "created_utc": 1590072923.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gnybht/dd_your_wifes_boyfriend_works_at_nvidia/", "is_self": true}
