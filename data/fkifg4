{"id": "fkifg4", "title": "Timing the bottom (BAILOUT related)", "selftext": "I believe the bottom or (close to bottom) will be whenever the market reacts positively to the bailout/stimulus potentially passing congress. Some of you might think things will sell off for weeks/months even if the stimulus passes. I do not. Even if I\u2019m off, I\u2019m ok being off 5% as long as I get in right before the market reacts too positively to the bailout news. I am planning to go all in in 1 year calls. \n\nLet\u2019s share rumors and news here about the stimulus/bailout timeline. \n\nDoes anybody know from articles when they might draft it? And pass it to the house before the senate? Any timeline? Have they even drafted it yet?", "created_utc": 1584499958.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkifg4/timing_the_bottom_bailout_related/", "is_self": true}
