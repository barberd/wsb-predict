The company is a pile of dogshit that can't make money. They have negative free cash flow. This Q1 report is just a blimp IMO, and their online sales won't be sustained. If anything retail shops shutting down will cause an inventory glut and suppressed prices. Couple that with Amazon + increasing online competition, a shit balance sheet with unrelenting debt and I think this stock should crater from the highs and everyone knows it. There is most likely short covering sustaining the run up. And we are at ATH which for sure must act as psychological resistance. I am compelled to sell calls and take advantage of super high IV. Or buy puts dated out to the fall around a 150 strike. They are just so expensive. Am I autistic if I think this stock can't go over 200 and I should sell loads of short naked calls???", "created_utc": 1588713791.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ge6him/my_autism_is_compelling_me_to_sell_wayfair_otm/", "is_self": true}
