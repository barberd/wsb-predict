First, some of you need Jesus...swear da bear gang lit a bag of bearshit on my porch last night, I seent it. Secondly, thanks to all who commented, questioned me, and made me better with knowledge; yall the real MVP\u2019s u/webulltrade and u /chodmode2.\n\nSo, join me on my trip to Wendy\u2019s for dat baconator (large combo now) while counting our tendies in our cybertrucks.\n\n**Previous post:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/em4qnr/autist\\_trading\\_with\\_rsi\\_macd\\_and\\_gap/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/em4qnr/autist_trading_with_rsi_macd_and_gap/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Today | 09 Jan 2020**\n\n\\- Stock of Choice: Skyworks (SWKS)\n\n\\- Chart Setting: 5 Minutes (That\u2019s 4.5 more minutes than I need\u2026wife hates it \\*fml\\*)\n\n\\- Why \u2013 Noticed it was on a down trend the last few days by eyeballing the chart. It has decent volume so some bull gang will pay for the difference since this stock swings $2-3 on a given day.\n\nNow does it match my \u201cthree stars align\u201d bullshit from my previous post? Wrote that shit when I was high and listening to Joe Rogan\u2019s Bob Lazar podcast. Where do aliens get their lights from for their craft? Autozone??? Dat free diagnostics nawimsayin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**In order that I looked:**\n\n**GAP:**\n\nI\u2019m sitting here pre-market with SWKS up on my screen, eating cold pizza from last night (talk about all thunder no lightning gut rumbles all day), and see this beauty happen at market open:\n\nBaby got Gap: [https://imgur.com/a/WShOETr](https://imgur.com/a/WShOETr) \n\nThis told me to watch this stock today. (Also backed up by good volume.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**RSI 250 Day:**\n\nSo, what\u2019s next? I wanted to see the overall nature of the stock, so 250\u2019d the shit out of it and can see it says \u201cfuck the bears\u201d\n\nBear hating proof: [https://imgur.com/a/EC7PTG2](https://imgur.com/a/EC7PTG2) \n\nThis is a good sign (gamble) it\u2019s going to go up in the short and long term, like my cholesterol, fucking wendys.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**RSI 10 &amp; MacDaddy (MACD):**\n\nThis was harder than watching Cats all the way through (punishment for my lack of 4.5 minutes as stated above). Probably the best 30 seconds of her life though.\n\nMight as well speak Latin to you autist: [https://imgur.com/a/cOhYQ2r](https://imgur.com/a/cOhYQ2r) \n\nActually, it\u2019s not that bad:\n\n1. Look at your indicators after the gap up/down \n\n2. Start looking for your entry point for a call or put (I recommend call, \u201cunlimited upside potential\u201d \u2013 Wolf of Wallstreet dude\n\n3. Keep \u201cwatching\u201d for a good point\n\n4. Execute when shit starts aligning (RSI 10/ MacDaddy/250) (250 is more \u201coverall\u201d)\n\n5. Watch for your exit point\n\n6. Take a chance\n\n7. Lock in Profit\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHopefully this is making more sense, I did the same thing with AMD yesterday and made a 30% gain.\n\nHere\u2019s my proof for SWKS gain using this method today. Yes, I\u2019m a cheap bastard and ain\u2019t ready to YOLO until I\u2019m 10/10 on this strategy. \n\n\u201cStanding here saying Fuck the ~~free world~~ bear gang\u201d: [https://imgur.com/a/sFVoAzd](https://imgur.com/a/sFVoAzd) \n\nIght gents, time for my fap and nap, peace out bitches.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Parting words of wisdom:**\n\n\\- Stonks only go up\n\n\\- If you can\u2019t dazzle em\u2019 with your brilliance, baffle em\u2019 with your bullshit\n\n\\- Good luck \u2013 use at your own risk\n\n\\- Listen to me if you want, I\u2019m posting on WSB\u2019s for christs sake\n\n\\- Shit with the shower on\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I'm looking at Tomorrow?\n\nNFLX - Nice change today (tendies wise) - good chance for a short call play (or put...fucking bears).
