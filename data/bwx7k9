{"id": "bwx7k9", "title": "No joke about how irrational the markets appear to be (small, but still painful losses)", "selftext": "This is not a YOLO or big options story. Just some experience of a random dude on the interwebz who is new to trading.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo opened an account a month and a half ago. Yes, missed the big December dip, but was determined to get in on the continued bull trend. Take long positions on your typical tech stocks that have been performing so well over the past years - Apple, Vanguard Tech ETF, Square, Microsoft, AMD, Nvidia, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI see small growth right away, everything is great. Then, nVidia takes a dump - ok, I'm holding, waiting to recover, it's not recovering, I sell and see it recover in 3 days. Dang.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen the Orange man starts China trade war - first big dip and 3% of portfolio value wiped out. I figure ok, no big deal - just double down and average down.  Then he tweets more and I see another 2% loss. Again, no worry - average down. Then markets get spooked and we got another 3% down. I'm starting to worry as I'm already 8% down on the whole portfolio and every position is losing money with Apple leading significantly with several dollars a day down-trend. I'm thinking, well, how bad can this be? Then the Monday rolls around and I see every stock just going through the floor. I'm telling myself - if losses go past 10% -  bail, it will continue to crater and there is no reason to stay as I can probably re-buy later at a lower price. Not that I want to lock-in the losses, but with downtrend like that it's probably going keep going down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMid-day Monday, I see my portfolio fall below 10% loss and I bail on all, but my smallest, but slowest loss long position. Go to bed thinking - well, this sucked, but in a few days will re-buy at lower prices. Wake up Tuesday morning and I see a rally. All tech stocks are up and Apple leading with +$10 bucks. \n\n  \nNOTHING changed in the markets from Monday to Tuesday except more certainty about tariffs on Mexico (which is bad news, right? It is bad...?). No new tweets, no real news on trade war with China, yet EVERYTHING i was holding Monday morning is up EXCEPT the one long position I'm holding. My entire \"Watchlist\" is green and the only stock i actually own still is RED.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would have recovered 2-3% on my positions if I didn't bail on Monday. So here I am, down 10% and looking at all the green in stocks I don't own.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs there a moral here? Maybe, I don't know. I don't see a rhyme or rhythm to market movement like that. Perhaps the old mentality of - If you are down, just resign to holding LONG term until positions recover (they should at some point, right, right?) and see it recover. But then maybe pull out early and use the remaining funds for other plays?", "created_utc": 1559700151, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bwx7k9/no_joke_about_how_irrational_the_markets_appear/", "is_self": true}
