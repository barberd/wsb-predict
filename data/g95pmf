Currently trading at $.03 with 30x potential upside ($7.5 share target).\n\nNLY is a mortgage REIT with \\~75% of its equity invested in Agency Securities and 25% invested in other residential real estate, commercial real estate and middle market businesses.

It\u2019s Agency portfolio which has no credit risk was worth an implied $7.5/share. Now, in that time interest rates have lowered which has driven the value of NLY\u2019s Agency portfolio up:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ymus0vngev41.png?width=1502&format=png&auto=webp&s=270ca092242a2c3763223287321982223e85d243\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFurthermore, on the last investor call NLY said that it was reducing its hedging \u2013 which would have paid off given that rates have remained low. The reason the stock is priced so low is because NLY is highly levered, but its business is structurally positioned to do very well in this environment and if the March numbers support that the stock can potentially hit the $7.5 target.", "created_utc": 1588010106.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g95pmf/nly_calls/", "is_self": true}
