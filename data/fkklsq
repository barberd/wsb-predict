Lotion will be huge in the coming months. Who sells a shit load of lotion? Bath and Body Works. Owned by L Brands, also owns Victoria's Secret and Pink. The lady stores. They also sell hand soaps and hand sanitizer. So basically printing money. Money from lotion to keep ~~my~~ women's hands soft and supple will be pouring in. Long calls on this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOther factors include:\n\n* $LB already down over 50% from recent highs so it looks like its been beat up more than others.\n* Every woman I know under 30 (all 4 of them) currently have the \"Angel Card\" VS' credit card, half only have that card and use it too much.\n* Everyone gonna be hella musty when they come out of quarantine, and some of Bath and Body's shit smells good.\n* Using good smelling lotion to jerk off makes your dick smell \"better.\"\n\ntl;dr $LB 12.5C 8/21 \\*edit\\* had the wrong date\n\nGay? 100%\n\nRetarded?
