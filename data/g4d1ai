Personally, I think it's way to early to label it the cure. It helped 113 severe cases.. severe cases can heal at home and usually don't need a ventilator. It is the critical cases that the drug needs to work for. So far, remdesivir seems to cut your hospital stay from 14 days to 10 and it is only available in IV. So why are we fucked? \n\nInvestors really think this is the one. A lot of people are going to hold onto this stock until FDA says yay or nay. They have earning coming up April 30th. I'd assume this to be bullish until earnings. \n\nPosition 4/24 80 & 4/24 75 puts.", "created_utc": 1587322132.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g4d1ai/to_my_fellow_gild_putholders/", "is_self": true}
