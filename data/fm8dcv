How the hell are you supposed to Disney+ and \"put it in his and/or her pooper\" while maintaining social distancing? And with the begining of massive lay offs, what's one of the first things people are going to cut? Superfluous subscriptions like Tinder Gold, which they were a fucktard for having in the first place. \n\nOk, past the obvious, these guys are about to have some serious debt. From their Q4 earnings, they listed 417M in current liabilities with 676M in current assests, which isn't bad. But they're also looking at 1.6B in long-term debt, which stands to double when they complete their spin off from IAC Holdings in 2Q20. That would make their debt surpass their total assests of 2.4B. They missed on their Q4 revenue estimate, which they cited increased competition as the reason, so more than likely Q1 and 2 won't be so great either with COVID19 considerations as well. \n\nWill online dating go away? Hell no. But in the short term I'm sure they'll continue taking hits. Now they, like many others, have been taking a beating lately and they're down nearly 40% this month and are sitting at their 52w low. Regardless, their current P/E is still at 27.5 so I'm willing to bet they still have room to fall. \n\nMTCH 4/17 $40p, only because there's no volume on further out. I was just doing this research so I have no positions yet, but once I cash out my current puts they're my next target.", "created_utc": 1584760302.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fm8dcv/puts_on_mtch/", "is_self": true}
