He sits in front of his monitor, behind him, two super models from last night's threesome shift in their morning drowsiness. He readies to cash in his SPY calls, dreams of Lambos in his head. Futures were green the day before, victory was assured. The gay bears could say that futures didn't matter as much as they wanted, but the bull knew that futures were aptly named futures because they predicted stonks' future.\n\nThe clock strikes the fated time, pre-market is live.

Beautiful chaos ensues, the popes last words \"Raining chicken tenders will herald the end of days\".", "created_utc": 1583132938, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fc8cz0/a_beautiful_monday/", "is_self": true}
