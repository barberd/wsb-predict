Restoration Hardware", "selftext": "Ol' Home town Buffett inexplicably jumped into Restoration Hardware a quarter or two ago... and the thing has continue to moon. Doesn't seem to me like a Buffett pick, but I guess neither Apple at the time he took his stake. That is why he is a millionaire and I lose my bi-monthly paycheck on OTM calls and puts. \n\nAnywho, at what point is it safe to back the truck up on long-term OTM puts on this piece of shit company? Somehow they have avoided tarriff impact from our fearless leader, but something has got to give, right? Beyond betting against a market-wide fall, I feel a stock that is propped up such as this would fall twice as hard. \n\nDisclaimer: I bought RH at 135, rode it down to 90's (didn't double down like the bitch I am), rode it back to 135 and sold thankful to recoup, and have watched 10's of thousands of dollars slip through my chubby piggly fingers over the last 9 months... I want to see the place burned to the ground and put out with rich people's tears.", "created_utc": 1575561029, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e6j0i2/rh_no_not_that_rh_restoration_hardware/", "is_self": true}
