I have a metaphor for you all, just bear (or bull) with me for a minute here, its about to get weird. Synthetic meat products are like sex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou have something that's been working for you for a long time, jacking off. You like it, it gets the job done, and its been readily available all the time. Then you hear about something new, sex. People talk about it, you have read about it, you imagine what its like, but you'll never really know until you stop spanking the monkey, find someone with low enough standards, and do the deed. Only then will you have any idea what its actually like, without that experience, you don't have any knowledge on the subject.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat does this sound like?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou have something that's been working for you for a long time, real meat. You like it, it feeds you, and its available nearly everywhere. Then you hear about something new, BYND. People shit post about it, you've read their impressively negative financial information, you wonder if its a good investment, but you'll never really know until you stop cooking the cow, find a grocery store that got sick of listening to vegans ask for the stuff, and taste some BYND. Only then will you have any idea what its actually like, without that experience, you don't have any knowledge on the subject and any investment is just a wild guess.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow like you all, I have never had sex. But I do have a bag of BYND \"beef\" crumbles here and I'm about to fry it up and make some tacos while my wife enjoys a nice dinner out with her boyfriend. I'm going to test the product on its own as well as in the tacos. I will report back to you all shortly on how it tastes, what the texture is like, and if I think this is a good company to invest in. Later, virgins!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[Proof\\]([https://imgur.com/sZuI3sH](https://imgur.com/sZuI3sH))", "created_utc": 1560299263, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bzkdqr/beyond_beating_your_meat/", "is_self": true}
