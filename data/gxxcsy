Just got my RH debit card a month ago and I\u2019ve only used it twice. So much for location protection considering I\u2019m in the U.S. and was hacked by someone in Brazil.\n\nOh and I emailed Robinhood when they were getting declined to let them know. Attached is the response email. Of course, a day later they were successful. Fuck Robin Hood. Thankfully I only had $400 set aside.
