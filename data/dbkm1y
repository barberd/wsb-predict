Where the majority of shopping was done by phone dial and order companies?  IMBI does. Of course you probably just thought that shit was girls gone wild, but your mom actually used to but shit like this. \n\n\nWell, basically this shit ass company dumped like a motherfucker a couple years ago and for good reason. They got the letter of bullshit from the SCC. They\u2019re gonna JCP. Plain and simple. \n\n\nThey\u2019re adding 2 new channels to their shopping line up (I think one is for men one is for women and Latinos but it doesn\u2019t fucking matter). They got this new person on the board who primes stuff like this to sell. I\u2019m telling you, these people are gonna pump over a dollar to stay traded and try to sell their company.  \n\n\nLook at the volume the past couple months.  There is ample room for David Wallace to come in and buy a ton of shares of Dundee Mifflin to get it over a dollar. It\u2019s worth a yolo play. I\u2019m in 10k (will submit pic). \n\nThis is completely fucked but I was also right about EROS (hope you assholes sold when north of 3....)", "created_utc": 1569887557, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dbkm1y/imbi_due_dilligence_severe_speculation_endless/", "is_self": true}
