Feel free to add why, favorite, positions you're thinking of, etc.", "selftext": "Trying something a little different - which means it will most assuredly fail.  The \"what are your moves\" and \"daily discussion\" posts are overrun with comments that are in no way related to the topic - i.e. political (the inane comments during press conferences are the worst) , flat out stupid, peeps trying to be funny (and failing), etc. - and a lot of thoughts (good/bad) are getting lost.  Maybe this can be simple and clean - post your positions and anything you want, ask peeps about their positions if you want, offer constructive criticism and share anything you may be evaluating.  Only thought it - all comments are around positions only.  For me:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* 15 DKNG 6.12 35C (currently down)\n* 30 DKNG 6.19 15P (currently down - bought this before call & before earning thinking it could tank)\n* 10 DLTR 5.29 81C (currently up)\n* 10 FB 5.22 222.50C (currently down - bought at high lol)\n* 20 FB 5.22 225C (currently down - bought more at high ...)\n* 20 PCG 5.29 13C (made money on the stock before - forgot about it til mentioned here - we'll see)\n* 20 SNAP 6.17 14P (currently down - just won't drop and probably won't)\n* 5 SPLK 5.22 157.50C (currently up)\n* 10 SPLK 6.5 180C (currently up)\n* 10 SPLK 6.5 135P (currently down - hedge for bad earnings drop)\n* 25 SPY 5.20 296C (bought at close today - hoping to sell at open tomorrow if run up)\n* 10 SPY 5.20 292P (bought at close today)\n* 50 SPY 5.22 305C (picked these up pretty cheap on Monday run)\n* 4 SPY 5.29 285P (currently up and probably won't be - was a partial fill on limit order)\n* 50 SVMK 6.19 17.50P (down a ton on this - very familiar with their business and got on wrong side)\n* 20 ZM 6.19 100P (because it had been awhile since I lost on ZM puts - this company ...)\n\nNormally don't have anywhere near this many positions - guess I got carried away.  I like the SPLK positions the most as I think earnings could be solid.  I'm thinking of puts on NVDA and calls on LVS, SBUX and ROKU.  I may by BABA calls closer to earnings with short expiration along with some FD puts just in case.\n\nRoast or add away :)", "created_utc": 1589945406.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gn3txj/what_positions_are_you_holding_monday_may_20th/", "is_self": true}
