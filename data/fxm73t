I cover <50 businesses, but maybe 5% are thriving because of this shit show, 10 additional % are going to be buying and trying to capitalize on the turmoil, and that leaves 85% asking for cancellations, postponement, etc.\n\nIt's fucking bad. The market is not representative of my customers texting me \"Demand dried up overnight, we need payment delays.\"\n\nI'm one of maybe 300? That's 85% of 300 - that's 300 people * 30 businesses, or 9000 domestic mid market companies, our mini sample, that are not doing a fucking thing.\n\nRiding dirty on some 5/15 200/210 and 6/19 and July Puts. \n\n[What Justin Long said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCIo4MCO-_U)\n\n\nTLDR Companies spent years investing in expansion. We're contracting and they're over-extended. Every mid and small cap mom and pop has been spending to increase capacity. Welp, here we are.\n\nEDIT: I'm holding a lot of 180-220 SPY puts from 5/15-7/whatever the fuck date.
