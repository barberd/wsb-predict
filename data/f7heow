Take a fucking look at this bad boy: $MMM\n\nBRKs dad has been looking for a cheap elephant for a while now after those tasty bites from AAPL and MA. He needs to make up for getting rammed by the shitty KHC choice, so \"food\" like MCD isn't an option. He can't afford AAPL, everything else is overvalued. Who is currently undervalued in that 120 billion cash range they have on reserve?\n\nIndustrials on this level have moat. $JNJ they already invest in, and it's highly priced (for Buffett) with P/E of 26.5. $PG has a P/E of fucking 74. Meanwhile $MMM is at 20, which is on the higher end for Buffett, but within acceptable range. Market cap of only $90 billion.\n\n$MMM is underpriced due to some shitty lawsuits that never matter long term for industrials, and regular business cycles. BRK doesn't have much in the way of industrials.\n\nAnyway, the actual smart guys will know I don't know shit about what I'm talking about, but $MMM looks kinda pretty blinking in red right now. Might be the bottom, but I've been saying that since $200. Anyway, I wrote all this via my Samsung smart fridge and don't want to write more.\n\n$MMM 7/17 $175 is my only position atm.
