The dude mumble\u2019s under his breath, insults his guest suit taste and asked one of the regular\u2019s on the floor of the NYSE if he could possibly talk without moving his hands, and his handoff for the next hour he says Courtney, one word and the camera hands off to brian Sullivan. \n\nCNBC if you\u2019re reading this, from one degenerate to all you retards, find some news readers that have an IQ higher than a jar of mayonnaise or don\u2019t have a bubbly cheerleader personality that annoys the fuck out of people trying to make money, not looking for recipes for soccer moms.", "created_utc": 1563300371, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ce0o0k/anyone_watch_the_train_wreck_on_cnbc_this_past/", "is_self": true}
