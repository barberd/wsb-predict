What Bears might need, after taking a pounding through April and getting jacked to the tits off the first smidge of red, is to tap the breaks a minute. A walkthrough of what to look for, what events are coming up, and how things might change throughout May.\n\n***1.*** Federal Reserve Intervention \u2013 how much has the Fed added to their balance sheet since the beginning of this crisis? Jan 20, 2020: 4.2 Trillion USD to ~6.7 Trillion today. Over the past month and a half, we saw the Fed add to their weekly purchases by up to 586 Billion USD (Mar 25th) dropping down to 82.8 Billion this past Wednesday. This change might be attributed to our moving past the initial liquidity crisis phase of the CV epidemic, and onto the solvency crisis phase.\n\nDate\t|Total Assets (Billions USD)\t|Change from Previous Week (Billions USD)\n:--:|:--:|:--:\n26-Feb-20\t|4158.6|\t-12.9\n4-Mar-20\t|4241.5|\t70.4\n18-Mar-20\t|4668.2|\t356.3\n25-Mar-20\t|5254.3|\t586.1\n1-Apr-20\t|5811.6|\t557.3\n8-Apr-20\t|6083.1|\t271.5\n15-Apr-20\t|6367.9|\t284.7\n22-Apr-20\t|6573.1|\t205.2\n29-Apr-20\t|6655.9|\t82.8\n \n***2.*** Interest Rates \u2013 Negative yield on the US 10yr. means a world of further hurt for the economy, and retirees specifically. Negative rates have had a net negative effect on growth in other countries (Japan, European Union) and the US has so far avoided this phenomenon. A theory tying the rate of balance sheet additions by the Fed to the US 10yr. yield, would be the Fed is targeting a low but positive rate of ~0.60%, by setting the overnight lending rate (0.50%) and ensuring lending and liquidity in markets through balance sheet additions. With rates at 0.60% right now, and the goal to avoid negative for the time being, the Fed feels their objectives are satisfied and have held rates and slowed their additions. \n\nIn his speech on April 29th, Jerome Powell made an unusual and direct comment to Congress regarding the interventions made to date, and that they may need to intervene again, \u201cif the recovery is to be a robust one\u201d. My takeaway from this: liquidity and interest rates are problems which the Fed can address. On the other side, a company can only operate so long without revenue, and it is in this arena that Congress must step up. The growing solvency crisis (CHK, HTZ, Any retail store) is something which is outside of the Fed\u2019s ability to control \u2013 they cannot print money, and even the junk bond \u201cspecial purpose vehicle\u201d maneuver is borderline beyond their powers. I think the market should have taken Powell\u2019s speech as a more desperate, starkly negative signal but either way I am convinced the Fed is not the unlimited money printing machine of lore, but rather the wrong institution with the wrong tools to tackle this crisis.       \n\n***3.*** Equities Market\u2013 No company was built to weather a crisis like this. Major changes in consumer behavior will develop. Already, we see savings skyrocketing as consumers are less inclined to spend, but there are many other potential economic changes which will change the makeup of our economy once things are \u201cback to normal\u201d: \n\nMore remote work might mean tech companies growth, but metro real estate\u2019s demise\nRestaurants have so many challenges ahead it actually makes me sad to think about \nCar usage has plummeted but there are further disruptions which this week rocked GM and F \u2013 rental companies are at risk of bankruptcy. Hertz the focus now, but others are in a similar position. Tens of thousands of used cars flooding the market on a liquidation of Hertz would implode Detroit. \nJust three examples\u2026 Companies\u2019 revenues have been disrupted in a way which has never been seen. The future remains uncertain, but any further extension of lockdown, spike in cases/ deaths, means reduced earnings. Lower earnings, stock values which are still near ATH\u2019s = P/E ratios that look even more overvalued (I won\u2019t address the weakness of the global economy prior to the CV outbreak, but it is a critical part of our present situation).   \n\n***4.*** Reopening of US States \u2013 herein lies the catch 22. Reopen states = end economic suffering, right? Well, you cannot demand that consumers spend. Consumers need to have faith and money to spend back at Jan 2020 levels. A reopen does not immediately solve this challenge, and a few weeks into May this will start to be obvious. To reopen, we needed see consistent reductions in new cases of Covid, a high degree of testing, and contact tracing. The magic formula. We lack this completely. US testing growth has stagnated. Just as the corona virus grew exponentially, so should our testing numbers have. Instead, we have flattened both curves, and set ourselves up for a massive failure. This is my key trigger for sharp selloff, as I believe it is the most concrete way to say, \u201cuntil the US government gets its shit together, or we have a vaccine/ treatment, the economy is broken.\u201d \n\n***5.*** Oil / WTI June Contract Expiration Approach \u2013Again, Macrovoices does a thorough job. In a nutshell: the market may misinterpret signals from the oil market in the next weeks, leading up to the middle of May. It currently appears we are not filling the oil capacity as quickly as thought, however, this is a due to floating storage (tankers) being utilized and storage at the WTI contract settlement location (Cushing, OK) being already at \u201cworking\u201d rather than \u201ctheoretical\u201d max capacity. We cannot simply shut off production capacity from oil wells, since there is a huge risk to equipment and the health of the well itself, so it is not likely that we reduced crude production / increased consumption at the rate implied in this week\u2019s storage utilization numbers. The dynamics involved here will play out as futures contracts near expiry, beginning potentially in the mid of May and leading up to the May 19th settlement date.  \n\n***6.*** Remdesivir \u2013 Risk risk risk. More than any other news event, this drug and positive / negative announcements have massively swung prices. https://twitter.com/MarkHoofnagle/status/1256242036015063042 Threads like these are a reminder that negative news on drug / vaccine development will be an instant trigger for the markets, up or down.\n\nMy positions: SPY 5/20 275/265 and SPY 6/5 270/260. Taking profits early. Keeping cash on the sidelines to be ready to roll my positions out and up if the rally goes higher. I am looking to get more aggressive with my puts as we approach the events I outlined above.\n\n***Key Indicators / Sources:***\nFed:\n10 Yr.
