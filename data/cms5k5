{"id": "cms5k5", "title": "WEN DD Today", "selftext": "For Wendy's today:\n\nThe call will discuss how the app has improved efficiency and reach, how door dash partnership has improved reach, and how the Biggie Bag remains a continued success with the ability to upsell to already loyal customers. If the stock is going to move up 2-3%, it's going to be based on how their report their app numbers. Whoever just downgraded them cited Chik Fil A as competitor, and unimpressive app numbers/lag to getting people. If they put good numbers on that maybe MM take kindly.\n\nWhat they will drop, and has the potential to move the stock 5%, is their investor day in October. Either now or then, this 5% move would come from their announcement of their international plan, as they are underrepresented internationally compared to competitors. The focus of investor day will be international. I don't know if today's discussion would be the 5% move, but I bet October is the better chance for that possible move.\nI suspect they will talk about investor day and the topic of international, with the bigger picture in October. Hopefully now or then we see that 5% move. She was just hired as president of international development.\n\nI don't think we'll see DIS+ movement, but I have long dated calls for all of this.", "created_utc": 1565105926, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cms5k5/wen_dd_today/", "is_self": true}
