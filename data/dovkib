They lost various parts in shipping and two weeks later we went in to the store because they thought they found a bench we had ordered. The \u201cbench\u201d was a desk and they said because they hadn\u2019t scanned it in to the system they couldn\u2019t cancel our order. We complained a little but more and they gave us a cash refund for the bench but for 10 dollars more than we paid. A couple of days later they canceled our order and gave us a refund to our credit card for the full amount. Who got rich by giving product away for free? \n\nDD above. \n\nRecommend buying OTM puts for sure. You\u2019ll be rolling in tendies.
