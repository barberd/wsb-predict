It was too calm the market. Ok, understood and I knew it would calm the selling but people would realize he didn't really say anything.\nAnd Kudlow saying, \"buy the dip.\" Duh, he needs to say that to keep the media cycle going. Again meaningless platitude.\nAnd BAC, hypothesis of 50 basis points would give a little lift to the market.\nAND IT DID!! We all saw the lift and then the eventual realization that, nothing's changed and the markets resumed falling...BUT WHY DID \"THEY\" start buying the last 5 fragin minutes of the market?!?!?!\nI MEAN \"they\" knew this was just the first down week.\nI MEAN \"they\" knew the market was still at all time highs compared to 2008/2009. \nI MEAN \"they\" knew there was more selling to be done as the virus spreads. \"THEY\" could have waited another week or two to pick up the stocks at a much cheaper price.\nSo why did \"THEY\" do it?\n\nI would really like someone from \"them\" to explain to us the why. \"You\" can use HUSHMAIL or PROTONMAIL to create a new Redditor and post Anon. Then kill the account.\n\nPlease, please, please I need to know why \"YOU\" couldn't wait another week, when prices would have been cheaper??!? Also what is the plan for next week???\n\nAnd how did you kill Epstein??\n\nThank you.", "created_utc": 1582955942, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fb8ag6/wtf_happened_the_last_5_minutes_friday_trading_day/", "is_self": true}
