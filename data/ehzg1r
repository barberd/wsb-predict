{"id": "ehzg1r", "title": "Every stonk I traded this year is way way above my sale price. Why does this keep happening to me?", "selftext": "On top of retard trading options I occasionally swing trade stocks which is much more successful. I always buy after something has crashed most of its value and think \"Oh I can make 500% if this bounces back. It's just like an option trade but with no theta and much higher probability.\". But then instead of reaping the full potential profit I awlays chicken out as soon as it looks like the stock is turning back down, so I turn a measly 10% profit before the stock proceeds back up. Then eventually weeks or months later Im looking at some soul crushing huge gain I could have made. It's all exclusively gains I missed. It's not like it's balanced out by a bunch of losers that I'm relieved to have sold. Here are almost all the stocks I traded this year:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* PCG: Bought at avg $6 and sold at avg aroune $6 for a small profit. Now at $10.80\n* NIO: Bought at $1.3 and sold at $1.6. Now at $3.72 and hit $4.85 intraday.\n* M: Bought at $14.7 and sold at $16. Now at $16.77\n* AMD: Numerous trades below $20. Now at $45.\n* NVDA: Numerous trades around $140. Now at $232.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I held all of these I would be up like $1 million right now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The only thing I still hold is BPTH which I'm down 50% on and will probably endlessly hold as it reverse splits itself into oblivion.\n\nwtf\n\nOh well at least it's better than my option trading where I make 100% losses on everything.", "created_utc": 1577775726, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ehzg1r/every_stonk_i_traded_this_year_is_way_way_above/", "is_self": true}
