Bars and liquor stores are packed with Loyola kids.\n\nThe school closed campus, and is making all the students take online classes. If you live on campus, you're kicked off. Go home.\n\n\nSo basically, these fucking mopes are treating this like a second spring break. They're all getting together, packing in tight, and getting wasted.... BEFORE THEY JUMP ON PLANES AND TRAVEL HOME ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.\n\nLoyola killed us all. Buy puts.\n\nPS:\n\nI hate college kids\n\nEdit:\n\nI shit you not. I walked into a bar where there's like 50 of them packed in shoulder to shoulder. I immediately heard one of them cough. And I got the fuck out of there immediately.\n\nYou can't make this shit up.", "created_utc": 1584057362.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhqb7v/i_live_in_chicago_loyola_basically_just_shut_down/", "is_self": true}
