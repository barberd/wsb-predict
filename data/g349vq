And if I\u2019m wrong then I\u2019ll throw all I have left in Microsoft and refuse to log in for 10 years. \n\nBut until then-\n\n1. There are many tests being done for a cure for Covid, if there is a cure shouldn\u2019t markets rally back to all time highs? Even if there is a drug that helps with COVID-19, if it\u2019s new then there has to be months of study\u2019s before humans can take it. I am not taking something that has not been around for at least a year. I\u2019m not the governments test dummy. \n\n2. How is the market able to go up even though unemployment is so high? Study the 2008 mortgage crisis. The market went on record highs and surged for over a year after many investors knew about the issues in the mortgage industry (I like to think most did not know the full extent). After the first big declines, there were several months were the S&P had good rallies. But the market would continue to steadily fall.\n\n3. Why do think there is a chance for the market to keep rallying? (This is the awesome thing about this unique situation) Look at China to give you an idea of how the US market will be affected. There market was still staying steady throughout the entire time they were on lockdown. Of course they are a ran by dishonest dictators, but there is plenty of dishonesty in history when it comes to US markets as well. There economy is shrinking by -6.8% through out all of this.. if ours is anything similar in comparison our economic numbers will be devastating.\n\nWhile markets are forward looking, markets wouldn\u2019t be successful if they did what everyone thought they would. The market would be a matter of who can get there the quickest to either put money in/pull money out, but as you and I now, if you get there too quick, you\u2019re fucked. If you get there too late, you\u2019re fucked. Don\u2019t get me wrong THAT is the biggest part of making great trades. Getting in before everyone and getting out for everyone. But it\u2019s not that simple. If it were easy everyone would do it.. AND make money.\n\nI know I\u2019m gay but here me out.. I\u2019m placing put credit spreads on BAC and SPY for short term plays. If market starts to go down. Hopefully I\u2019ll still make a few dollars and get out before I\u2019m OTM\n\nTLDR: SPY 11/20 $200P", "created_utc": 1587137684.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g349vq/recession_cancelled/", "is_self": true}
