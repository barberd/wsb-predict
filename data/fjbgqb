{"id": "fjbgqb", "title": "Gold and other precious metals had a massive drop and are set to rebound hard", "selftext": "Price changes over the last week:\n\nGold down **9.3%**\n\nSilver down **15.9%**\n\nPlatinum down **15.6%**\n\nPalladium down ***29.8%*** (largest weekly decline on record)\n\nAll these metals dropped hard because of a massive liquidity rush. Large investment firms are selling in massive quantities to cover for margin calls. In spite of that, if you go to any precious metal dealer's website right now you'll find that nearly everything is out of stock. [APMEX](https://www.apmex.com/) currently has a warning on their page for shipping delays due to extreme order volumes. Additionally, the US Mint has completely sold out of silver coins ([https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/coronavirus/card/u4qjZDrkGuuPLxl29J38](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/coronavirus/card/u4qjZDrkGuuPLxl29J38)).\n\nThe selloff caused a temporary increase in supply, which will quickly crunch down because the demand is insane right now and production is slower than ever thanks to boomer cancer. On top of that, we're about to have a 100 basis point rate cut on the 18th. Expect all of these metals to moon hard.\n\nWhat's the risk? The liquidity rush might not be over. If Monday is absolutely catastrophically blood red then the value of these metals might drop even further. But by now all big firms will have closed their bullish positions from January if they aren't completely retarded. You be the judge.\n\nIMPORTANT: For all of these metals you should invest in funds whose holdings are the physical metals, NOT shares of mining companies (they're getting fucked by corona). That means funds like GDX and JNUG are probably not appropriate for this play.\n\nThe tickers:\n\nGold: **GLD UGLD**\n\nSilver: **SLV USLV**\n\nPlatinum: **PPLT**\n\nPalladium: **PALL**\n\nThe play:\n\nBuy shares? - Yeah, can't really go wrong with this. Don't expect super huge gains though.\n\nBuy physical bars/coins? - Also a good idea, though only do this if you plan on holding them for a couple decades at least. More of a typical boomer play than a WSB play.\n\nBuy calls? - This is ok, but keep the expiration in the short term. Options across the board are expensive as fuck right now due to high volatility.\n\nSell naked puts? - If you're reading this for advice, no.\n\nPut credit spread? - This is probably the way to go for a long term play. Still good gains without the potential for a nightmare scenario with put assignment. If you're using Robinhood and you're a noob at this, go to the trade options window for the ticker you want and scroll down to the bottom. It'll have a menu for put credit spreads and it'll do everything for you.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nLong **GLD SLV PPLT PALL**\n\nCalls:\n\nBuy GLD $150c 3/27, SLV $14.50c 3/27\n\nSpreads:\n\nSell GLD $155p 9/30 and buy GLD $125p 9/30\n\nSell SLV $15p 9/30 and buy SLV $12p 9/30", "created_utc": 1584317380.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjbgqb/gold_and_other_precious_metals_had_a_massive_drop/", "is_self": true}
