{"id": "g3k1ls", "title": "Apple Calls? Puts? Both?", "selftext": "So as everybody knows Apple just released the new iphone se which is only $400! Now this is convenient for many people because price isn't too bad, design is familiar, size is liked by many in the age of big smartphones, specs aren't too bad so anybody who is tired of android & their shitty app support might jump ship, & ofc it's an iphone! People are receiving that stimulus check & my guess is they wouldn't mind spending 1/3 of that check for a new toy. \n\nNow the problem is these faggot ANALyst like GS will try to downgrade apple due to the Rona situation in which they will spinoff the view that people won't be buying iphones anytime soon & if anybody remembers 2 years ago apple was given downgrades left & right which caused a massive sell off & price didnt recover asap.\n\nI am tempted to buy calls this week as apple hopefully releases pre order numbers on monday during market hours, but like I said analysts will try to push the price down so now would be a good time for any of you option traders to enlight us on good strategies to use in this play like straddles & iron condor or whatever the fuck they are called lol", "created_utc": 1587197566.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g3k1ls/apple_calls_puts_both/", "is_self": true}
