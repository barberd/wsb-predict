It had a big 'dollar-sign' sticker on the top that he got for 50 cents at the bowling alley. He opened the computer and used his pointer fingers to type in his password: \"J-Money#1\". \n\nHe took a long sip of the warm milk in his coffee mug. \"How much more should we print?!?\" he yelled at the intern situated at a desk outside of his office.\n\n\"I don't know man, it's unlimited, just make up a number\" the intern shouted back. JPow hated the intern's dismissive tone but the young man was 6'5'' and built like a NFL linebacker... his wife called the intern a \"Chad\", but JPow didn't know what that meant. He mumbled to himself, \"I'm the money man. Nobody else.\"\n\nJPow opened up the Google sheets doc titled \"$$$ Money for government $$$\" and looked at the only cell on the sheet with anything in it. \"100 trillion\" it read.\n\nHe stopped for a moment, smiling at his own brilliance, then deleted the word \"trillion\" and replaced it with \"gazillion\". JPow nodded and took another sip of the milk, satisfied with his work for the day.\n\n\"Good to go!\" He yelled at the intern.", "created_utc": 1585318681.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpxovw/just_another_day_in_the_life_of_jpow/", "is_self": true}
