Invest extra student loan money that I have left which is another $4,000 into that same stock. Then use all the leverage that RH gold offers which is another $13,000. Boom. $23,000 and drop it all into one stock. Once the stock goes up 25%, I just made $5,000. \nDo that for the rest of my life and never have to work again. \nCan\u2019t believe I just shared this genius strategy with you guys but I wanted to help you out.
