Guys, the obvious $CLX train has been pumped and left the station. Now's your chance to get in on something that hasn't been pRIceD iN.\n\n\nHis original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2kbv8/dd_flir_thermal_cameras/\n](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2kbv8/dd_flir_thermal_cameras/)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTo his first point. Yes, high temperature and fever is a temperature of Coronavirus. It's turning out a lot of people are actually carrying this virus asymptomatically. It doesn't matter through. A lot of governments, companies, and individuals are itching to get back to normal. Do you seriously think large sporting events, conferences, restaurants, and offices are just going to be shut down for the year? Fuck no! The relatively small cost of a few thousand to placate the public and provide false sense of security is well worth the cost. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nBoth the market and public, especially in red/purple states, are eating up the bullshit Donnie is hyping up about America being back to business May 1st. The White House has also released some guidelines about how the businesses can \"safely\" open back up. \n\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/ykRWOGd](https://imgur.com/a/ykRWOGd)\n\nSource: [https://www.whitehouse.gov/openingamerica/#criteria](https://www.whitehouse.gov/openingamerica/#criteria)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWell, why don't companies just buy cheap thermal temperature scanners from China? Besides the [obvious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rt26Wn_XE2I&loop=0), advanced thermal scanners allow companies to scan people more rapidly, accurately and safely. \n\nFurther reading: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-thermal-cameras-fo/as-fever-checks-become-the-norm-in-coronavirus-era-demand-for-thermal-cameras-soars-idUSKCN21R2SF\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWell, why FLIR? Because it's public so you can actually fucking trade it, unlike most other thermal imaging companies. They are also [well-positioned](https://www.flir.com/products/flir-a320/) for the upcoming surge in demand as their products are tailored specifically for testing people. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nOverall, $FLIR stands well-positioned to profit bigly from governments and companies, whether this virus turns out to be as bad as we \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b's expect or a giant nothingburger, due to pressure from governments and fear from the general public. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nOne last note: earnings are expected to be released 4/22, premarket. Not that I think bad earnings this quarter will negatively affect the price in this completely irrational bull trap. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI yolo'd 20x $40c for 5/15 because they were fucking goddamn cheap. The smart play would be either $35c 5/15 or $50c 7/17 per /u/Vainglory27 's advice \n\n\nGoodluck, retards.", "created_utc": 1587089659.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2t1b1/dd_flir_thermal_cameras_watch_this_one_go_up_bigly/", "is_self": true}
