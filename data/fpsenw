I'm hoping my journey gives some hope that through the bags you can get some baggers as well. Couple things out of the way: inb4 Robinhood is garbage, [included screenshots of my current positions plus my trades](https://imgur.com/a/nYXiCYx), also $BYND 40p 5/15.\n\nI started as a buy and hold retard, but realized I was going to be a wage cuck for the rest of my life. They brainwashed us in school to think of options as only hedge instruments, but then I started lurking here and saw there were serious tendies to be made.\n\nI liquidated my portfolio in December (about $3K at the time) and then deposited another \\~2K to get started. I made small tendies on Becky FDs, and felt ready for my first YOLO. I decided on Amazon Q4 earnings, which Papa Bezos ended up coming in clutch to boost me into five figs (15K).\n\nI then FOMO'd into SPY and Tesla calls at possibly the worst time right before the beer flu hit (Feb 18th) and watched those two blow up my account back down to where I started. Out of desperation I deposited another $2k and YOLO'd that plus the cash I had left in my account on  Beyond Meat FDs for their Q4 earnings. They ended up getting beyond fucked and I was back up to 16K.\n\nThen beer flu came to America and I just followed everyone's advice by loading up on SPY puts. After the first Monday circuit breaker gang bang I rolled these puts into 3 more rounds of SPY puts. I got fucked by the mouse along the way, and also managed to get more soy vegan tendies served up from BYND again. This week I switched to SPY calls since it's literally free money, which has saved my account from the enormous shitbags I'm currently holding, mostly TSLA and PLAY.", "created_utc": 1585292259.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpsenw/mostly_hairy_gay_bear_gains_55k_to_100k/", "is_self": true}
