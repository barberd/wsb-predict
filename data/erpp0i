{"id": "erpp0i", "title": "My weekly trading strategy", "selftext": "Ok, so--first thing in the morning when the market opens, I'll usually yolo all my cash into some put credit spreads on SPY or AAPL or some shit expiring at the end of the week.\n\nThen, you ask: what do I do now while I wait for tendies?\n\nI usually look at the screen, those options that I sold some poor fucker quickly depreciating to zero. I like that feeling, that feeling that I just scammed someone of their hard-earned cash. I particularly like to imagine that this person saved up a lot of money and finally entered the stock market to just lose it all to Papa Theta. This usually makes me kinda hard, actually. Especially when I think of all those poor peasants I'm sending to rot on the streets because of my epic options plays. Just the thought of them shivering in the cold, slowly dying, their cash in my pocket--it's enough to get me to blow my load twice (sometimes even thrice) in a day.\n\nAnd this, my friends, is how I have amazing hands--I almost always let my options expire worthless as I'm too busy jacking off to poor people. Usually the joy and pleasure that I get from this practice is worth more than any money amount that I might have lost.", "created_utc": 1579582239, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/erpp0i/my_weekly_trading_strategy/", "is_self": true}
