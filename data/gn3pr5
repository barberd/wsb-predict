{"id": "gn3pr5", "title": "LK resumes trading tomorrow at 7:00 AM (Bullish and Bearish case)", "selftext": "NASDAQ announced Luckin Coffee will resume trading tomorrow morning from 7:00 am ET\nThey have also announced they plan on delisting the stock, Luckin has appealed this and there will be a hearing. These hearings usually take 30 to 45 days from the date of the appeal.\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/luckin-coffee-to-resume-trading-wednesday-as-company-receives-delisting-notice-2020-05-19\n\nDURING THE HALT:\nSince the stock was halted because of the accounting scandal, they have fired their CEO and COO. \nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-luckin-coffee-investigation-idUSKBN22O29J\n\nThe company is also under investigation by Chinese regulators\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/luckin-coffee-under-investigation-by-chinas-top-commerce-regulator-11587967299\n\nHowever they have continued to open new stores at the rates of 10 per day, and had a total of 6912 stores as of May 12th\nhttps://www.bloombergquint.com/china/luckin-coffee-still-expanding-full-steam-despite-sales-scandal\n\nThe company has increased its registered capital by $500m to bring it to $2B\nhttps://www.yicaiglobal.com/news/scandal-stricken-luckin-coffee-adds-usd500-million-to-registered-capital\n\nGOLDMAN SACHS:\nGoldman Sachs is bagholding over $350m of the stock because Luckin chairman defaulted on the terms of his margin loan. It was a $518m loan, so Goldman is down $169m based on the current LK stock price. Goldman have said they intend to sell the stock.\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/d0c81e1b-88db-4609-aaa6-ec3a18af374f\n\n\nThe stock closed at $4.39 before it was halted. That gives it a $1.11B valuation.\n\nBEARISH CASE:\nLongs are going to try and get out of their positions tomorrow morning after being forced to hold for so long, the delisting news makes the situation much much worse.\nWith all this pressure, the stock might drop to as low as $1 or atleast $2\n\nBULLISH CASE:\nYou really wanna be bullish on this? Alright autust, have it your way. \nThe company has continued to expand during the halt and may have been oversold after the scandal. The stock has been halted since April 7th, thats a lot of interest that shorts have had to pay up and after having held for so long they will wanna cover their positions too. Since Goldman Sachs owns such a huge stake they might do some Goldman things to prop it up.\n\nTLDR:\n(It might be too late by the time options markets open, you will have to buy/short the stock. Sorry autists, no strike, expiry here but the risk is still there.)\nShort it if you are autistic but sane, go long if you are the kind of retard that buys bankruptcy stocks for a bounce. If you aren't either get your ass back to r/investing.\n\nMy positions:\nI am currently badholding 207 shares of the stock thanks to 2 puts I sold just before the halt, the other 7 shares I bought because I was bored.", "created_utc": 1589944923.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gn3pr5/lk_resumes_trading_tomorrow_at_700_am_bullish_and/", "is_self": true}
