{"id": "bnta7j", "title": "$GPRO this week", "selftext": " \n\n$GPRO\n\nAfter a VERY strong earnings on Thursday this saw a high of $7.75. Friday then saw a sell off in a weak market. Sitting at $6.42 now and at a VERY strong support of $6.40 of the 50 day moving average it can EXPLODE next week. I think this for a few reasons.\n\n1) Short percentage currently 66%.\n\n2) They have now seen 3 upgrades over the weekend from $8-10.\n\n3) A raised guidance/beat and a future road map of new/exciting products.  \n\n4) A stronger market next week.\n\nI strongly think this company has turned things around. This will see a new 52 week high this week IMO", "created_utc": 1557690569, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bnta7j/gpro_this_week/", "is_self": true}
