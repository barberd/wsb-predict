{"id": "fgy8f4", "title": "Economic stimulus right now is insane. Hear me out. Please.", "selftext": "I shall kindly ask you to entertain a \u201ccrazy\u201d idea and then follow my logic to understand some implications of that idea actually being true. \n\nThe \u201ccrazy\u201d idea is:\n\nWhat if \u2026\n\nwhat China is doing (extreme social distancing measures despite taking massive temporary gdp hit of 30-40%) is actually the optimal behavior in the face of this immense threat? What if other strategies like \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d will lead to much worse outcomes, such as economy still crashing AND  millions dying trying to save it? \n\nIf this threat is indeed so large, larger than anything humanity has faced in decades - perhaps it warrants the greatest adjustment of our behavior in decades? But what are we doing instead? Isn\u2019t stimulating the (current) economy is essentially spending the scarce humanity\u2019s  resources in the face of this grave danger to pay people to keep doing what they are doing and act as if nothing changed\u2026 \n\nThis is not just supid. This is Nazi Germany level of batshit insane. (you get the pun right?) \n\nIf the \u201ccrazy\u201d idea turns out to be true and doing business as usual will lead to 20-60% of the adult population getting infected (as per Harvard epidemiologist Mark Lipsitch) and at a modest 1% death rate assumption that could lead to tens of millions of deaths... Then how exactly is Trump better than Hitler? Because killing tens of millions to not let the billionaires go bankrupt is inherently more noble than killing tens of millions trying to win a world war for domination? \n\nHow exactly is a senior in 2020 America or almost other country for that matter better off than a jew in Nazi Germany in 1938? The future is not defined, but whether you understand this or not - you are exposed to huge risks of dying because your leaders and the rest of the society have gone batshit insane and seriously believe that killing millions people like you for some insane idea like \u201cGDP and employment must never fall!\u201d is perfectly acceptable. I mean listen to them. The leaders literally  keep saying that everything is fine because this basically only \u2026. kills the old.\n\nHow much millions of the elderly are you (stock market bulls) or the bureaucrats of this world willing to sacrifice per percentage point of GDP? \n\nIf the \u201ccrazy\u201d idea is true - then how are the scholars and the experts advocating for stimulation of the economy better than Hitler propagandists? I kinda think they are the worst. I mean for billionaires these ethically challenged matters are at least worth billions\u2026 \n\nBut the propagandists will be instrumental in millions of deaths for nothing. Later the same elites will not say that millions died because they are evil and incompetent. They will say this happened because xx number of Nobel laureates and experts told us it was necessary to stimulate the economy so that people would not lose their jobs... \n\nBut perhaps just as politicians can not just order everyone to jump off roofs and kill themselves - they can\u2019t not also force this suicidal behavior on humanity? Perhaps the stock market and the economy will crash no matter what politicians and the oligarchs want or do? \n\nThe feedback loop between markets and the economy that Soros calls reflexivity is supposed to be common knowledge by now. This market decline is self sustaining. As economic expectations decline and people sell - the stock market falls, more people become aware of severity of the situation,  economic expectations worsen further, financial institutions become more fragile after losses, people pull money of funds and those smart faced dip buying \u201cprofessionals\u201d become forced sellers in the worst moments after investors pull money from their fund after sudden huge losses. The oligarchs have no shame exploiting their advantages over you such as tax loopholes and lobbying\u2026 But now the one advantage you have over the oligarchs is the one that matters. You are nimble. You can press a button, sell everything and decrease your exposure to economy performance to zero. The oligarchs have no such button - there are not enough bids out there for them. By pressing this button you are not only protecting your capital. You are accelerating this feedback loop and accelerating the speed of the inevitable crash that  also happens to be the next best thing for all humanity in the absence of leaders with a half brain.", "created_utc": 1583937907.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fgy8f4/economic_stimulus_right_now_is_insane_hear_me_out/", "is_self": true}
