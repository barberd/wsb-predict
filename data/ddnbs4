My Webull brokerage does not have options and I think these may have similar or better returns that put/call options.  These still decay but at a much slower rate than options, and alternatives to vix ETN.  As with the case of XIV these ETNs can \u201cfold\u201d abruptly if they become insolvent.  \n\nAny thoughts or alternatives that anyone here uses?", "created_utc": 1570282506, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ddnbs4/non_option_or_futures_trading_vehicles_aka_webull/", "is_self": true}
