This obviously carries substantial risk, similar to the FD\u2019s that contribute to your losses on a regular basis.\n\nA good trader should have proper risk management strategies in place, which usually means hedging. I get it, you\u2019re not a phaggot, why would you cuck your astronomical negative gains by hedging? Well, when it comes to getting butt-fucked by the IRS (kinky), you should, and I assume some of you are pulling out all the stops.\n\nSome tax evasion hedging strategies I\u2019ve heard of:\n\n. Pit bulls at primary residence. Those nasty auditors will think twice about knocking on your door again when little Fido just took a nip out of their left nutsack.\n\n. Sandpaper graft surgery in/around anal cavity. Your audit is complete, and because you\u2019re autistic, you\u2019re now in prison. Assuming you\u2019re not gay (unlikely) you\u2019re gonna want to ward off Tyrone during morning shower time. One pump and Tyrone will think twice about approaching your butthole ever again. \n\nThese are just a few common strategies I\u2019ve heard of, but I know we\u2019ve got a lot of ingenuity here on WSB. How are you guys managing your risk going into 2019 tax season?\n\n.", "created_utc": 1581961520, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f5cg0r/not_irs_what_are_your_strategies_for_hedging_your/", "is_self": true}
