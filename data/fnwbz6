And some touched lows 500% off recent highs. \n\n-The dead cat bounce won\u2019t be proportional. Punished sectors that have a glimmer of hope, like restaurants, will vastly outperform travel stocks and retail.  \n\n-Next Monday buy 250 SPY calls, 52.5 VIX puts and a basket of restaurant calls for the dead cat bounce. \n\n-Hide gains from your wife\u2019s personal trainer. \n\n\nThe sheer fact that I\u2019m typing these words means that COVID19 will destroy the world economy. This analysis will be 10O% wrong and if you do the opposite you will swim in tendies behind an iron gate to keep out the zombie infected boomers who want to take you down with them. \n\nI\u2019m basing this on the (wrong) belief that we will have a temporary bottom after the jobless numbers on Thursday and stimulus passage Friday if we haven\u2019t had one already. Smart people have called 210-215 on SPY for a run back to 270-280 in the short term, so let\u2019s use that scenario. I\u2019m also baking in the possibility that one of three things happens: 1.) One of the drug trials due in early April gives us a treatment and restrictions will be loosened as we ramp up production; 2.) The curve flattens China style and a percent increase in new cases peaks in 10 days (the dude who nailed the China numbers early on made this prediction); or 3.) Trump says fuck it and we go to a tiered lockdown that is focused on hot spots and vulnerable populations. \n\nIf those things happen (and again I must remind you they won\u2019t) we are looking at enormous pent up demand from people desperate to leave their houses with that sweet sweet stimulus money in their pockets. The relief will make people feel good. The weather will make people feel good. The cabin fever will make people want to be out and the stimulus money will give them the means to justify it, at least for a while. This seems like common sense psychology, and because it seems so logical it\u2019s doubly incorrect because the market will not be rational. \n\nThat leads us to restaurant stocks, which have been clobbered. This dead cat bounce won\u2019t be proportional. And unlike travel stocks restaurants have the ability to make up some lost business. No one will be making 4 trips to Disney to make up for the 1 they cancelled, but they may shove their faces full of Texas Roadhouse a few extra times. \n\nHere are some brand leaders/recent highs/current prices:\n\nChipotle: 933.84/588.71\nDarden (Made me their bitch on my puts): 124/41.03\nStarbucks: 93.75/56.55\nTexas Roadhouse: 71.52/39.35\nDave and Busters: 48.80/9.96\nCAKE: 42.52/15.71\n\nIf you assume a 50% bounce from here that takes PLAY, for example, to $15. Still 225% off of their recent highs. Volume is thin right now but last price for the 7/17 $15 call was $1.45 (bid ask is .30/4.30 which is scary AF) and makes me hesitate\n\nDon\u2019t do this. It won\u2019t work. But it kinda seems like it could. If I do it you should  buy puts, because I am dumb and only make good trades when WSBgod tells me what to do.", "created_utc": 1585013378.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fnwbz6/dd_you_should_not_believeits_not_even_very_good/", "is_self": true}
