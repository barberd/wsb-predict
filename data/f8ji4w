This spreads into the US. If it hits the US, it's game over. Because the US economy is driving by spending, most of which involves some kind of physical transaction, a hiccup in this which slows the velocity of money\n2. This spreads further into Europe (note Europe is #2) and causes further disruptions in the supply chain, this time into more expensive goods (expensive machinery, etc)\n3. Europeans and Americans not having the balls to lock down a city because of human rights or some pinko reasoning like that. \n\nBull case:\n\n1. Fed, along with the ECB and BoJ starts printing. The US hasn't even experimented yet with other methods of easing such as helicopter money. \n2. Warmer temps starting in Spring inhibits virus spread\n3. Vaccine or new drug that cures the virus\n\nSo... calls on QQQ and SPY, puts on CCL and GOOS.", "created_utc": 1582507679, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f8ji4w/bear_case_and_bull_case_from_here/", "is_self": true}
