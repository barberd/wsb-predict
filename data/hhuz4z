{"id": "hhuz4z", "title": "Why Tesla will go to the moon as it joins S&P 500. Possibly bigger than the $250 to $950 run.", "selftext": "TL;DR:  the \"jump\" to the S&P 500, combined with short covering, combined  with very high options premiums might set up a gigantic buy event that  could eclipse even the big short squeeze of TSLA earlier this year, when  it catapulted by +$700 from \\~$250 to \\~$950.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's  a little known aspect of Tesla's potential S&P 500 membership:  currently TSLA is not part of the S&P 400, the midcap index.  Why is  this relevant? Most index funds already own S&P 400 names, and  joining the S&P 500 is a simple matter of transferring shares  internally.  But it's very rare for a company to not be part of the  S&P 400 when it joins the S&P 500.  In this special case funds  bench marked to the S&P 500 will have to buy tens of millions of  TSLA shares from the open market and hold the shares - reducing the  float significantly.\n\nSo TSLA  \"jumping\" on the S&P 500 without the interim step of the S&P 400  creates huge buying pressure that is underappreciated by the market.   TSLA will join the S&P 500 if it posts a marginal profit in Q2, but  this is highly uncertain, so funds cannot buy in advance.\n\nCan  funds buy options instead? This arbitrage opportunity is closing as  well, because options premiums past the Q2 earnings report are already  over $100 for near the money options, higher than 10% of the underlying.   For example September $950 call options are currently trading at  around $125, which represents a 13% premium. Any fund buying such  options risks losing that hefty 13% price on a speculative bet to  front-run TSLA S&P 500 inclusion.\n\nOf  the global \\~10 trillion dollars of investment assets bench-marked to  the S&P 500, about 0.6% or \\~$60b would have to purchase TSLA on  inclusion, to simply become benchmark-neutral.  I believe only a  fraction have done this so far, which sets up a potentially huge  self-reinforcing event once TSLA's S&P 500 inclusion probability  reaches 100% on Q2 or Q3 profitability.  All the funds that \"missed out\"  will have to scramble to acquire the required shares - and if TSLA  rises rapidly as a resulting buying pressure, the urgency to buy TSLA  will increase in a positive feedback loop.\n\nThe  comparatively still very high short interest in TSLA (12% of the float  compared to \\~2% for similar high-tech firms) might further add rocket  fuel to this phenomenon, in form of short covering.  In particular  long-short funds that are dominantly bench-marked to the S&P 500  will have significant incentives to close their equity short TSLA  positions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I'll try to address some of your concerns.\n\nI cannot estimate price rise percentages, and I don't think anyone knows, because share pricing is a \ud835\udc89\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc88\ud835\udc89\ud835\udc8d\ud835\udc9a non-linear phenomenon.\n\nIt all depends on the size of these groups:\n\n* The \"never sell below $5,000\" crowd\n* Insti investors already prepared for S&P 500 inclusion\n* Squeezable equity short anti-shareholders: their covering is anti-dilutive as well\n* Arbitrageurs with call options\n* Momentum\n\nIn the extreme I could imagine a triple digit percentage rise, but that requires a \"Perfect Storm\" scenario with most funds buying into the Tesla FUD and sleeping at the wheel.  Or it could be a dud or sell-the-news event, if institutional TSLA owners plus arbitrageurs outnumber the required \\~40m-60m shares.  I find this unlikely though, as existing options positions are not nearly large enough for that IMO, plus options don't print new shares.\n\nThe \"Perfect Storm\" scenario would involve a dramatic contraction of the TSLA float, because most buying pressure would be anti-dilutive, taking shares out of the float permanently: either to match a portfolio allocation to the benchmark at any price possible, or to cover.", "created_utc": 1593413137.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hhuz4z/why_tesla_will_go_to_the_moon_as_it_joins_sp_500/", "is_self": true}
