{"id": "h7aztc", "title": "BHP - cheap long term play/ great potential", "selftext": "Iron ore reserves are at a recent historic low in China.  They import a ton of it and much of that is from Brazil.  Brazil is in the middle of one of the worst Covid outbreaks in the world and it is getting so bad that the government has decided to stop reporting on a lot of it.  Brazil is probably the top exporter of Iron ore and due to Covid and the political environment, there are lot of fear of more shutdowns.  VALE (One of the larges Iron ore producers) has already had to shut down a number of their mines.  With the supply issues in Brazil under fire, where to turn? Australia and their Iron ore.  BHP is a huge supplier.  The stock has been on a nice run and has a lot of upside.  Citi just this week reported they see a 25% upside in Iron ore prices due to the Brazil situation.  Options on this play are dirt cheap as well, even those that are far out.  I have played short term (more risky but dirt cheap) and long term.  There is some variance in bid vs ask but I had no problem filling closer to the bid or somewhere in the middle.  I got $55 July calls and $62.5 Jan calls (that was an accident, I meant to get $65 calls which you can probably get for $0.65-0.70).  Check out prices in trading hours as bid-ask at night makes no sense but during trading hours much closer. And again, be sure to use limit orders, as I had no problem filling a fair deal amount less than the ask.", "created_utc": 1591924329.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h7aztc/bhp_cheap_long_term_play_great_potential/", "is_self": true}
