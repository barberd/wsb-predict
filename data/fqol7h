Let me tell you about how WSB is getting screwed even when it\u2019s right. It\u2019s a novel so go make some tea.\n\nThe past week has been crazy. 3m unemployed and stocks only went up. Makes no sense, right? Wrong. What you guys need to realize is that the market is not an omnipotent being that prices in every move and plays 4d chess. It\u2019s more like a caveman, driven by greed and fear. Especially during this time.\n\nThree weeks ago, everything was fucked. Not because the virus was spreading, which it always was, but because people started to realize how bad it was and began panic selling. And the trigger was the oil crisis over the weekend that led to bloody Monday. Leveraged funds exploded. Investors were getting margin called or panic sold. Treasuries were basically unobtainable. Corporate bond issuances completely froze. Credit default swaps skyrocketed. Commercial REITS were fucked because they needed to sell illiquid assets to meet fund outflows. Every company was maxing out its credit lines with the banks\u2026you get the idea.\n\nIt was like a run on the banks, but for corporations and investors. That\u2019s what drove the markets down. Plain and simple. It was FEAR of a LIQUIDITY CRISIS.\n\nThen Powell stepped in with his alphabet soup of liquidity mechanisms. ZIRP, PDCF, MMLF, CPFF, FX Swap, TALF, PTIF, ESF, SMCCF, PMCCF. I made up one in there and it doesn\u2019t even matter.\n\nWhat mattered was that, suddenly, the liquidity crisis vanished. The fund backstopped everything with its QE infinity. Yield spreads fell back. People didn\u2019t need to margin sell anymore. Foreign dollar denominated debt wasn\u2019t about to fuck up an emerging world country economy. THAT\u2019s what rallied the market. Immediate FEAR was taken out. And that\u2019s why all the \u201cbut worldometer virus count doubles every three days so markets go down\u201d geniuses got screwed.\n\nFor better or worse, with the Fed promising QE forever, the liquidity crisis is now no longer a thing. What comes next will be more ominous: a solvency crisis.\n\nLiquidity is basically any company\u2019s ability to pay very short-term liabilities, like payroll, interest, rent, etc. in the VERY IMMEDIATE TERM. It's about access to cash. For financial markets, it\u2019s also how easily investors can get in and out of positions. Powell lubed the shit out of liquidity.\n\nSolvency, on the other hand, is about the company\u2019s ability to meet LONG TERM debt obligations with its operations. When you talk about unemployment, no consumer spending, high corporate debt load,etc, what you\u2019re really talking about is a solvency issue. Companies can\u2019t produce the revenue to service their debts.\n\nCorporate debt levels are astronomical today. Higher than any level in history. At same time, the virus is not slowing. Consumers and companies are not going to spend. Unemployment is through the roof. The fundamentals are really, really bad.\n\nBUT here\u2019s the kicker, now we\u2019re talking about fundamentals, and NOT fear. The market will trade down because the fundamentals are bad, not because its panicking for lack of liquidity, and that will take time.\n\nWhat I\u2019m saying is yes, the outlook is atrocious and the market deserve to be much lower. BUT it will take much longer to play out because people are no longer panic selling. The Great Depression took 3 years to get from its high to bottom after Bloody Thursday/Tuesday.\n\nYes, maybe the SPY will hit 180 or even lower. BUT it may take 6 months to get there. Meanwhile your OTM 4/17 puts will bleed on theta and never get ITM.\n\nWe\u2019re still at a time of VIX backwardation, meaning expected volatility in the more distant future is LESS than in the near future. I think this is bullshit and an opportunity. With a solvency crisis, it\u2019s a slow burn all the way down.\n\nOr I\u2019m just full of shit.\n\nTL;DR: look for long-dated puts. July, September, or even later. Buckle up and pay the premium. Be careful with very short term, very OTM options. Volatility will likely go down even as stocks go down.", "created_utc": 1585416958.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqol7h/from_liquidity_to_solvency_crisis_why_wsb_is/", "is_self": true}
