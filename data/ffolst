EOG has net breakevens in the Permian basin close to $25/bbl, they have about $2b cash on hand, and in ~$4.5b long term debt. \n\nIf you want to know what the price of oil can get down to in an international price war, look at EOG's breakevens. \n\nThey even brag about great returns at $40 bbl, and they aint lying.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-eog-results-breakeven-idUSKCN0XX1L9\n\n\nA lot of producers, like Apache or Noble who work in the same area don't have the cash on hand to ride this market out. They'll have to accumulate more debt or .... you know.. the bad thing. Many of them have already restructured since 2017, the banks they borrowed from are going to be strapped for cash when they can't pay their principle without borrowing more...\n\nAlso, don't bet your life savings away because of some post on the internet.
