Booking/travel (EXPE, BKNG, TRIP, etc). Casinos and entertainment (CZR, WYNN, etc). Even SQ to an extent, with fewer brick and mortar transactions.\n\nSo what\u2019s the deal with YELP? Yes, it\u2019s already  suffered measurable losses. BUT, it has relatively low IV right now and hasn\u2019t lost as much as similar travel sites on the 1mo time frame. It definitely seems like it stands to lose more amidst corona fears. Thoughts?", "created_utc": 1583336962, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fdew1i/whats_the_deal_with_yelp/", "is_self": true}
