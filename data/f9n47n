Unfortunately, while there is a ticker, EPHE, for Philippines, there are no options available for it\n\nPosition disclosure: I currently hold about $2000 cost basis worth of puts in EWY, THD, and EWM\n\nTL;DR buy EWY, THD, and EWM puts", "created_utc": 1582688812, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9n47n/dd_potential_beer_virus_impact_by_country/", "is_self": true}
