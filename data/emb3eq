Opened it up, didn't say what company it was from and I checked my portfolio, nothing matched\n\n[The mysterious dividend](https://preview.redd.it/9kw9s1bssr941.png?width=534&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72754d60e7792fffba279f57d5d33914c146aee8)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuper weird. Checked my transaction history, and then I saw it... That stock is for Lam research or whatever, I had brought it to impress a girl who's initials were LAM (it didn't work out - she was engaged hence I sold)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[I buy here...](https://preview.redd.it/faxrr4zctr941.jpg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c87c8a247bee05e5eec52ed527218a0b69159c3c)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[And sell here...](https://preview.redd.it/343stdmctr941.jpg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b22655c8cb5da1140f27b7c1cd5aedb9ff1c18c)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoooooo, I've sold it all, and they paid me a divided anyway?
