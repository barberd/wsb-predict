But I'm here to tell you, that we're going to the moon.\n\nBy drawing a line from previous highs to our current location. And another pretty line from the December lows to today, we see an interesting formation. Lets call it a wedge. \n\n*drum roll*\n\nBut also on this chart, we see the 50 day moving average is about to cross above the 200 day moving average, which translates to free tendies.\n\nSo what're you gonna do with your life today? Are you gonna BTFD and ride the SPY to 290, or are you gonna just stare at Rohinhood all day until your battery dies?
