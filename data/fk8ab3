None of this shit is real.\n\nThere is no fucking way Trump stands in front of the country and just says words that mean absolutely nothing for 20 minutes a day and it moves the market so much. \"They're some of the best companies. As a matter of fact, they're the best companies in the world. I don't think companies like this were ever around but they are now. We're going to stand up here one day and say we won. Very soon. It's nobody's fault but trust me soon we'll say we beat it. What we're doing is unprecedented.\"\n\nI just went short 400 shares of SPY and MSFT assuming (correctly) that this fuck would get on stage and say absolutely nothing. I get so pissed at every fucking retard who buys anything that is said but maybe I'm the retard? I just don't get it. Are there hedge fund managers out there saying, \"Holy shit Trump is going to take care of us I need to hop in now?\" Or are they assuming other people are thinking that? Are they assuming that other people are assuming that they're assuming that? Anyways, gotta hold 800 fucking short shares of MSFT and SPY overnight until this dips again. Vent complete.\n\nSPY 220 P 4/17\n\nMSFT 140 P 417\n\nEdit: I would've bought options but I just moved 25k back over to ToS and it hasn't cleared yet.", "created_utc": 1584462888.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fk8ab3/we_live_in_a_simulation/", "is_self": true}
