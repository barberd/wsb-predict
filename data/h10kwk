{"id": "h10kwk", "title": "Liquidate me, I deserve it!", "selftext": "How to fuckup multiple times with the help of Robinhood. Don't mind if I do...\n\nOver the past few months, I've slowly run my RH account up \\~15-20k. RH isn't my only trading account I have a self-managed 401k and trading account on another platform which I manage differently.\n\nHonestly, I like the RH mobile app and can gamble while casinos were closed.\n\nYesterday I had a plan....\n\n1. sell 10 6/12 220c at open \\~+1.5k\n2. sell 15 6/19 220c at close \\~+3.5k\n\nHere's what actually happened. I've never use the web app, but for some reason, I logged in at my desk. I clicked the option, entered 10 in the box, clicked review order, then submitted. One major problem...\n\nI never clicked Sell to Close tab. Well nbd. I'll just sell to close 20 instead of 10. I click sell to close enter 20. Stop right there day trade restriction. I try and sell off the 10 extra that I accidentally bought. No dice. My account is over 25k so I was like oh NBD I'll just toggle it off. I look through the web app cant find where the fuck to toggle the option. Navigate back to option screen. Say fuck it...\n\nGrab my phone. Navigate to where I know the day trade toggle is.... Click the toggle. It seems to turn off. Go back to the web app. Enter 20. Click review and submit. Realize I just bought another 20 calls.\n\n>40 6/12 220c\n\nHow dumb am I? Very. I click sell tab enter 40. No dice. Still have day trade restrictions. wtf. Look at the mobile app.\n\n\"Sorry, we've encountered an unexpected server error. Please try again.\"\n\nEventually, after a very frustrating hour and an email, I'm able to toggle the box successfully and end up liquidating my Baba positions including the 6/19 ones out of frustration. The bloodbath yesterday and this fuckup forced me to re-up +5k to maintain a 25k balance with about 18k in cash mostly from baba options before jpow speech.\n\nLater in the day I go on tilt and dump all my cash into options while Jpow is talking. What I hear is there is no limit to the amount of \"brrrrr\" I am capable of in the next 2 years... So fuck it lets reup! What the market heard was completely different.\n\n* Yesterday account opened \\~32k (37k with +5k I added later)\n* Close at  \\~28k (with the additional 5k)\n* Today open \\~15k (with the additional 5k)\n\nSobering to experience a +27k swing in 1-day span. Especially considering without my major fuckup and without the help of Robinhood not letting me toggle I'm likely at 25k without a 5k reup. It's worse when you think keeping all those Baba positions till and hr before close is probably +10-15k. Going on tilt in frustration definitely cost me most of this loss.\n\nEnjoy my degenerate ways and laugh and my stupidity. Worst comes to worst I gained an investment loss and can use it to withdraw from other investment gains guilt-free?
