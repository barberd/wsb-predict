{"id": "giess7", "title": "best way to hedge option position overnight from a seller's perspective?", "selftext": "Let's assume an automaton (market maker) is the seller. His algo is to chase pennies while avoiding large liabilities. In other words, he is not interested in speculation one bit, his focus is solely to collect pennies and lose as little as possible. I'm familiar with the following 2 hedging techniques -- sell N call options, buy N\\*100 shares (i.e. covered call writing), or the same technique applied to puts; and buy a deeper OTM strike to hedge the strike you've sold.\n\nThe theoretical max loss to the seller of covered calls is very large (if price plummets), and quite limited with the OTM vertical spread. In addition, if the market is very liquid, e.g. SPX500, gold, etc, he can maintain an offsetting position in the futures market overnight and emerge unscathed the next morning. What about wild securities like BHC, JD, KO where 10x swings are possible overnight. For instance last Friday the nearest $45.5 KO call shot up 1100% relative to the day before on a modest 2.9% rise of the underlying. How do you minimize losses in these securities **as much as possible** from the perspective of the above mentioned market maker.", "created_utc": 1589301622.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/giess7/best_way_to_hedge_option_position_overnight_from/", "is_self": true}
