What cock did you take in your hairless ass that made you panic sell over a 1.8% drop? ON A TUESDAY AT 2:30??? Holy fuck. You all think you have balls until you don\u2019t. Just to prove a point, I will go all in tomorrow morning on MSFT 2/14 190 calls. And if I lose who gives a fuck? I will be calling my bank for a personal loan against my house for 150k and re rolling on 2/21 190 calls again. If you\u2019re scared today, please leave this sub. If you can\u2019t take the pain, you can\u2019t get the gains. \n\n\nWhat happens if I lose my house on MSFT next week?
