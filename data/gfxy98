{"id": "gfxy98", "title": "DD from 5/5-5/8, Cisco, Logitech, Box, and SmileDirect, TLDR and Plays included", "selftext": " Welcome back to the WSB DD Summary! This is for 5/5-5/8. I\u2019m your host and resident autist u/expander2. You have to be able to read to gain anything from this so that rules out about half of you. As always, ticker is in bold on the left and what I deem \"important\" is near the top of the post. A TLDR, plays, and previous DD summaries will be at the bottom. My last posts still stand and hold some good info so check it out for more plays if this isn't enough for you greedy fucks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry I missed a day, there was no good DD because the people that write it on Tuesdays and Wednesdays are even more retarded then the rest of us. Lets get right into it, I have a few today. First is Cisco. If you don't agree with me then skip it and go to the next one because all of these are quality plays in my opinion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CSCO;** Everyone and their boyfriend is advocating for calls here, remember that. Cisco Systems is a company that makes products related to the communications and information technology industry, provides infrastructure platforms, including networking technologies, communications technologies, and internet security software. All these things are very important when a large portion of the population is working from home. Once more, they have consistently beat earnings the last 3 quarters. Their next earnings (Q3 for them) is released on Wednesday 5/13 and I assume that they will beat earnings.\n\nNow from that information it seems like I\u2019m going to advocate for calls right? Nope. WITHOUT FAIL, their price has tanked after earnings for the past 3 quarters. Weird right? On 8/13/19 (Q4) they were trading at $52, earnings on the 14th they dropped, by the 15th the price was at $46. 11/13/19 (Q1) they were trading at $48, earnings came out, 11/14/19 they hit $44. 2/12/20 (Q2) they were trading at $50, earnings came out, 2/13/20 they were at $47. They beat earnings each time but drop quite a bit. This quarter is already expected to be a loss but they are going to beat their expected earnings of course because they consistently do.\n\nI see[ all these posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gfv64m/ok_heres_another_good_dd_for_you_twats_csco_529/) saying[ calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gfg47b/cisco_systems_csco/),[ calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gfax7l/cisco_csco_calls_will_print/), calls. Sure, calls will work on the run up probably. There is also a pretty large run-up before earnings historically. So here's what I\u2019m going to do. Next time there is a drop (which will probably be Monday) I am going to buy calls. I will let those ride up to just before the closing bell on 5/13 and I will sell all of them. At the top on Wednesday, I am going to double down on my puts to take into account the price jump from the past few days. Then when they drop on 5/14, WHICH THEY ALWAYS DO, I will sell and have made money on the up and down. Whatever you do, don't hold through earnings. All the people advocating for this are looking at the numbers only and no historic trends whatsoever. Or do hold. I couldn't care less what you did with your money.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**LOGI;** I do, however,[ agree with this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gfuid0/logitech_logi_earnings_report_next_week/). Logitech is going to crush earnings and keep going up. They are a PC gaming accessory company. Shit like headphones, keyboards, webcams (for all the cam girls), microphones, stuff like that. Gaming in general is killing in this market but webcams are sold out too because everyone needs it for their company zoom calls. They are at all time highs right now. With all ATH\u2019s, come a sell off to lock in gains. I am going to try and get in on the next dip for calls but sell as soon as I can after earnings because there will be a drop that's just how it works. Earnings are Monday (5/11) after hours so this is a time sensitive play.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**BOX;** Next, Box, a tech company that specializes in IT, tech management, cloud content, computer shit. Now the difference between them and the other companies is that they deal with the big companies like Microsoft, IBM, Salesforce.com, Apple, Google, Slack, Adobe, Morgan Stanley, GE, and a bunch more.[ This post goes into](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gfm6mi/think_inside_the_box_dd/) a little bit more detail. In an extremely connected market driven by a FUCKING PANDEMIC, their product (cloud security, business applications, tech overhaul) sells itself. The good thing is that their quarters are all wonky. Their fiscal year ends 1/31 so their Q1 includes 2 solid months of boosted coronavirus numbers. They report earnings 5/27 so there is plenty of time to get in on this. I am going to wait until next week to look at this further and see where it is headed. I plan to add this into a reminder so you won't have to remember all by yourselves. You dipshits seem to have trouble with that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SDC;** Last is SmileDirectClub. They are an oral care company (so am I, HMU) that basically makes retainers/braces for fixing your teeth then sends it to you in the mail. What has been a huge craze during this lock down? Self care and bettering yourself. Now here on WSB we do the opposite and develop a gambling addiction because of the immense amount of time we have but a lot of people are actually trying to make themselves better. SmileDirect has partnerships with United Healthcare and Aetna and starting in May will be with Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield. That means they will have partnerships with more insurance companies bringing in more potential customers and increasing revenue. Earnings are released on 5/13 after hours. They were sitting above $15 before the drop and now are around $8. The[ OP of this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gf9cr0/your_next_earning_play_for_big_gains_sdc_tldr/) says $8.5c and I agree but you can go a little higher if you want.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is one of the first posts I have made where I can say that I honestly believe all of these will pan out. I know I'm going against the grain with CSCO but its a gut feeling I have. Everyone is saying CSCO with have massive gains and how many times do you see \"inverse WSB\"? Well I'm inversing it. There are a shit ton of posts about LOGI so if I didn't write enough I'm sure you'll be able to find a reason to invest.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck fuckers and tune in on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for more WSB DD Summaries!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR;** Cisco go up then down like always, Logitech go up, Box go up, SmileDirectClub go up.\n\n**Plays;** CSCO $45+ calls but sell BEFORE earnings come out, CSCO puts around $4 less than the peak on Wednesday, both CSCO plays can have 5/22 expiry. LOGI calls at $55 for 6/19. BOX calls at $18-20 for 6/19. SDC calls at $8.5-9 for 5/22.\n\n**Previous WSB DD Summaries;**[ 4/25-4/27](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9a05f/dd_from_425427_the_markets_future_wingstop_huazhu/),[ 4/28-5/1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gby6ez/dd_from_42851_match_alphabet_and_a_reminder_tldr/),[ 5/2-5/4](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gdkvqf/dd_from_5254_zillow_next_leg_down_oil_reminder/) ,[ How to play earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ge06g7/how_to_play_earnings_like_youre_not_a_retard_tldr/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDISCLAIMER; I am not personally advocating for any play that I add to this list.
