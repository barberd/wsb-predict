{"id": "fdxvra", "title": "Puts against 6 Flags", "selftext": "Currently, SIX has around a 10x debt obligation to ebidta value. (Go see for yourself https://imgur.com/ztAHv7Y). ~$2500 million in Q4 2019 in debt obligations and earned $268 million.\n\nA large amount of their revenue comes from foreign tourists, which there will soon be none let alone American consumers. They have already been struggling with customers before corona has been a big deal. \n\nTheme parks are unlikely to get a bailout if they fail (unlike airlines, etc) and 6 Flags will most likely be insolvent soon tanking their stock price. \n\nThey went bankrupt in 2008 and it will likely happen again.\n\nTo the people who were shorted Disney because they had 40% revenue exposure from theme parks, you will love 6 flags 100% revenue exposure.\n\nPuts at June 19th 20 or 15 strike, Best of luck gentlemen\n\nEdit: So far, I've gotten a lot of comments saying the price has already dropped a lot. So let me give you autists a metaphor. If someone sells you a bag and it's full of shit, you take a look and think, \"the price of this bag of shit has already dropped 50%, it won't drop anymore\", that's a lot of people's comments. Yes it has dropped a lot but it's still a bag of shit, it doesn't matter how much it drops, a bag of shit is a bag of shit.  \n\n\nEdit 2: Ok, guys don't buy if you aren't comfortable with risk, I'm yoloing because I think it will probably tank. Do your own research if you aren't comfortable with my analysis then determine for yourself what is best. Don't be a hive mind.\n\nHow is everyone more comfortable with shorting SPY when the premiums are so much higher lmao. You guys are shorting real stocks with a lot of value. I'm shorting what I deem to be a company that is in danger. \n\n\nIn terms of my selling date, I'm going to sell when I think the company has bled enough, which I don't think it has yet. When I see \"Thousands of cases in the United States\" on the front page of the WSJ, I will probably let it bleed a little more and then sell. We haven't hit the point of critical mass yet for Corona. \n\n\nEdit 3: There are also other theme parks that don't have high prems yet, some WSBers are smarter than me and have gone after Seaworld, FUN, LYV and those put prems are apparently not as high. Do your own research and determine what to do. Also, when I bought shorts against this, it wasn't down as much, now it's down more so everyone should do their analysis and evaluate. I'm holding for the time being. \n\n\nTLDR: Who the fuck goes to 6 flags?
