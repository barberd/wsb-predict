Please feel free to comment how i'm wrong and a retard below: this is not financial advice. This is simply what the charts are saying. Ah yes, I know magical crayons are retarded but believe it or not, the market has been trading purely on technicals this entire time. The bounce today? IHS and was very very apparent this morning, hence 288% gains in SPY calls. Anyone who is a full bear or bull in this market will **LOSE MONEY**. Learn to play both sides.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3l99p8ehtvy41.png?width=1312&format=png&auto=webp&s=1027ce5af35f45ec508ed97f7a7afd934f6d0dfe\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gpk41rf7tvy41.png?width=1157&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7963f3d3b0be29205d373d937a697288fc9a9c0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0dprho1etvy41.png?width=1312&format=png&auto=webp&s=782bfe2cdf7150aa1ff085ed42c765a2c7ce6c19\n\nWhat's on the menu for tomorrow? Well it's OpEx. Fully expect the market to pin and trade flat to flush out option holders (expecting it to be rangebound between $284-$287). One key level for tomorrow is ***2875.50***. Major major level to hold and it will validate the strategy below. Also, FWIW, we closed below the monthly 5 EMA today so everything is still in tact for how this is going to play out. Also looks like there's a negative divergence building on this uptrend as well.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f9uhberhzuy41.png?width=1240&format=png&auto=webp&s=22d65e660669cf9b82a65810ff35c997fbb697d9\n\n***So formerbuck, what do you think is going to happen?***\n\nVIX will pop above $50 by end of May and we'll see SPY at 260 or as low as 250. VIX will re-trace back down to low 30's possibly mid 20's in June/early July during a face-ripping rally back close to ATH's. Late July & August, we will see the massive move down in the market when bankruptcies start piling up and that is when we will see a VIX over $90 and possibly over $100 and a SPX $1800-$1900. I could go so far as to saying I could see the VIX hit $150 in 2021 but we can save that for a later time ;) (cc: u/scarvesandsuspenders)\n\nNow, I know some of you are asking, \"Why a big rally in June/July?\" Well markets are back to running on stupid. Stupid produces higher prices. Basically, you all need to put your stupid heads on shortly. Anyone trying to trade these markets with a brain will get crucified. The bears will return but the super stupid phase is next.\n\n**POSITIONS:**\n\n**Today**\\- Cashed out [$280 5/15 SPY calls](https://imgur.com/a/Z7ymeNH) I bought at open for 288% gains at close.\n\n**Tomorrow**\\- Cash gang until 3:57 and then loading up on 6/17 $50 VIX calls and 5/29 SPY $288 puts. Why 288 puts? because I like a nice little delta on my trades and i fully expect us to pin and trade flat for OpEx tomorrow. Max high of 287.50 tomorrow. If we remain below that, the setup is ripe for a retrace back to to open gap below 260.\n\nWe need to see a weekly close below 2789 tomorrow, then we can have a bearish engulfing on the weekly chart. This is rare and has only happened three times since 2015. What has happened following those three times? 4 weeks of red. Be cautious bulls.\n\nI'm active in u/wallstreetbooyah 's twitch stream daily if you wanna tune in and see live updates.

If not, look forward to the retarded comments this will get.", "created_utc": 1589518778.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gk2tek/bull_trap_followed_by_bear_trap_followed_by_bull/", "is_self": true}
