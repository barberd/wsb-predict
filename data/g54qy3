(June/July are currently at $21 & $27)\n\nThe USO share price was trading at 7.8% above the NAV price today (that most certainly will not last).  USO was actually worth $3.46 as of the close of trading today.  \n\nAs you check current prices - you can see June is up to around $21.28 and July is up to around 27.12 giving USO a NAV of 3.59. \nHowever, since the July price increases are keeping pace with the June prices as they increase \u2013 that still leads to 22% loss of contracts. \n\nObviously, prices change daily, but if the difference between June and July prices remains this high \u2013 contango will wipe out another large chunk of contracts. And $27 oil will get you the same USO price as $21 oil.  \n\nThat being said, if oil shoots up to $40 before then, I guess you'll be fine. \n \n \nFYI: the math is very basic \n\n(Contracts x 1000) x Oil price = market value. \n\nmarket value / shares = NAV price \n\nNAV price + premium discount = Share price", "created_utc": 1587428473.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g54qy3/uso_contango_effects_in_may/", "is_self": true}
