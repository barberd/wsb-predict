{"id": "ctos7u", "title": "BYND Puts?", "selftext": "BYND is a biotech company masquerading as a food manufacturer. Here are a few reasons the stock is going to zero.\n\n1. BYND claims \"GMO Free\" but their production process relies on fermentation i.e. yeast modified to produce their protein isolates. When the veg-tards catch up to this they will be pissed.\n2. Companies including Nestle have already committed to plant-based meat substitute research.\n3. Typically it takes biotech companies 15-25 years to release a product to market from lab scale. BYND did it in 4, without patenting anything by trying to blitz the market before the big guys catch up. It's only a matter of time before ConAgra, Cargill, Dow/DuPont, etc. develop more efficient manufacturing/better yield yeast strains. \n4. **MOST IMPORTANTLY** They only have one patent: the process that allows them to get a texture similar to meat. No biotech patents. This means that they have no exit strategy other than to become a major manufacturer. There is no way they can compete with the already established food manufacturers proficient in bioprocessed food manufacturing.\n\nThe stock is going to zero.
