To all bulls, \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b are going to keep rolling out with this shit. Daddy Trump isn't going to stop this with his $1 Trillion dollar idea.

The rest will fucking follow. This means Karen has all her kids at home and none doing any sports, or be able to go out for a while. Grocery stores are going to look more and more empty and as soon as the dad goes on unemployment the booze section is next...\n\nI just walked through my local grocery store and I must say, the shelves are still empty.
