I think this alone will pop the stock price tremendously and this makes a great yolo on those 850 6/1 calls. \n\nAll they need is feature complete status, and then everyone with a Tesla makes a YouTube video of their car (even super crappily with a lot of disengagements) driving them around door to door. Every talks about it and gets jazzed about Tesla. \n\nThen all of a sudden everyone says, well it\u2019s not there yet, but it does everything now. Maybe they don\u2019t need that LiDAR thing to get to full self driving. \n\nThen all of a sudden analysts have to say, well maybe they do have almost 1 million cars on the road are capable of being FSD.. \n\nThen Tesla gets to add 100-175 billion in market cap as the front runner company in FSD tech.
