So I\u2019ve fully immersed myself in the GME propaganda and it\u2019s all in calls from here to hell.\nMy question is, since I make irresponsible, impulsive and uninformed decisions: when my GME calls FUCKING MOON how do I offload them on RH?\nJust hit the sell button and voila?\nSay I\u2019ve got 10 of these $5.00 calls on 10/18 and RH says my break even is $5.35 how do I cash out when the price hits $8.35 on 10/19?\nI should probably just give a stranger my log in and get a verbal contract to trust them not to rob me and sell when it\u2019s best.  Verbal contracts are enforceable in court too.\nThoughts?", "created_utc": 1567981652, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d1hzb5/filthy_rich_gme_from_rh/", "is_self": true}
