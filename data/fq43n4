{"id": "fq43n4", "title": "Payroll system collapsing", "selftext": "I run a midsize business with a lot of blue collar workers and a weekly payroll.  I got a notice today that starting in two weeks they were only going to accept ACH payments if you send them a week in advance otherwise everyone needs to fund payroll by wire.\n\nSo many companies are failing to make payroll or playing the float that the ach system is being abandoned.  Banks don't trust each other and don't want to get caught holding the bag so they are making everyone pay cash upfront.  Tons of companies on weekly payrolls were playing that float before this all happened.  In two weeks they are toast.\n\n[Positions](https://imgur.com/a/QEMWkbO)", "created_utc": 1585338277.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fq43n4/payroll_system_collapsing/", "is_self": true}
