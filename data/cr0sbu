{"id": "cr0sbu", "title": "GE conspiracy theory", "selftext": "Just hear me out..\n\nBill Ackman's big public play today was betting on Buffett and the Oracle of Omaha's sweet tendie pile.\n\nBill Ackman's last big public play was a 250+ slide presentation on how Herbalife (HLF) is a pyramid scheme. Which it is you retards, the SEC even said it was but HLF made sure they never said the word pyramid scheme in their documents when they were fined $400m\n\nThe sole reason I believe this failed is because Carl Icaan hates Ackman with a passion and short squeezed the fuck out of Ackman with a major stake in HLF after Ackman's presentation.\n\nMarkopolos' history with enron and workcom shows that he is a knowledgeable investigator into fraud and knows his way around financials, something most people seem unable to comprehend when it comes to GE, and to the public eye is now a credible source no matter how much some broad from the GE BOD slanders his ass a hour before closing.\n\nWhat if the big hedgefund behind this GE investigation is Ackman's Pershing Square Capital and he wanted the news of the report to be timed perfectly with his investment in BRK to cover the costs of buy some sweet FD's on GE while Markopolos does the dirty work as the front man.\n\nOr I am completly fucking autistic.\n\nThank you.", "created_utc": 1565926763, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cr0sbu/ge_conspiracy_theory/", "is_self": true}
