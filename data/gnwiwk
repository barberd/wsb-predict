Americans are pretty transactional when it comes to voting, and as much as they fear China, few incumbent presidents have been re-elected during a bad economy.\n\nA magical turnaround on the China subject by the very mercurial Trump in the next couple of months where he reaches magical trade deals with China could cause the market to rocket up in massive / huge gains.    I estimate there is about a 15% discount on the market right now because of China fears.\n\nAll it'll take really is one well worded positive tweet.\n\nIssues:\n\n* Are there forces at play in the Senate / GOP which will keep him from doing this?\n* Does Trump (have good reason to) believe that China as boogeyman will help him get re-elected?\n* Will there be a 180 or will it be a soft rollout of China positive tweets?\n* Will China allowing investigations into the origin of the virus be the catalyst for positive news?\n* Is China willing to go along with a change of heart?  If they really want Trump gone it's possible they won't do anything, which is why Trump is all anti-china all the time because no possible positive deal is coming?\n* Conversely, if China is unwilling, will they ramp up the negative rhetoric themselves and start decoupling from the US even more.  For example, BIDU is thinking of delisting itself from the US markets", "created_utc": 1590066440.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gnwiwk/predictions_whenif_trump_will_end_china_cold_war/", "is_self": true}
