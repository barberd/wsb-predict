Shitty DD inside.", "selftext": "\\[4/17 UPRO 34c\\]\\[6/19 SPY 200p\\]\n\nOkay, I know I'm a fucking idiot with my magic markers, but last night I was trying to establish my entry and exits of my UPRO 34c money printing machines and setup a basic trading channel on SPY's chart around this rally. So there I am, logging in to ToS and thanking u/wsbgod I don't have to use some trash like Robinhood, my SPY puts fuck me more than adequately, thank you very much, when I see SPY broke the channel and then traced it all day from the land down under!! RIP Steve Irwin.\n\nSupport and resistance were derived from VolumeProfile distributions. Channel bottom was defined by the low at the start of the rally and the last price at the time of creation.\n\nI know, I know get to the fucking point. I think  [**u/Variation-Separate**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Variation-Separate/)  is right. This rally is losing steam and will start shooting dust by Friday. My bull exit is SPY 295 / UPRO 39. The leg down could take a couple of weeks to hit bottom hence the 6/19 SPY 200p. My exit is 220 unless something changes.\n\nOh and the other picture is of someone with a dick bigger than all of ours, like you don't understand, even if our dicks were magically able to assemble Voltron Style, this Peter North motherfucker is throwing 500k on 4/17 36.5p  which must be an insane hedge otherwise I may have found the first signs of the birth of our autistic god. The one true god, not some impostor that hit the lottery 8 times in a row, but an autist 10 times more autistic than u/controlthenarrative. Truly a wonder to behold.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0ldn0ylehws41.png?width=3172&format=png&auto=webp&s=94ee9aaa22349aa5d80a51b747c662eb7d6929db\n\nEDIT: This is my first post and as mentioned I'm a dumbass and fucked up including the picture.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1586920848.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1k17a/spy_moves_to_the_basement_but_wont_move_out/", "is_self": true}
