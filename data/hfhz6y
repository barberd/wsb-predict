And game performance is usually more dependent on GPU than the CPU.\n\nThe GPU in this case is a **Nvidia** GPU. So they're comparing two different versions of Nvidia GPU, and hoping we think the speed difference is due to Intel vs AMD!\n\nDesperate measures I guess.", "created_utc": 1593070667.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hfhz6y/intel_caught_sort_of_cheating_on_benchmarks_again/", "is_self": true}
