They told me to calm down, gave me a drink. I don\u2019t know what was in the drink, but I blacked out. And when I woke up they had both my legs over their shoulders and they where numb sucking my asshole like there was no tomorrow. I tried to fight it, I tried to get away, but I was restrained. They told me I liked it, they told me not to worry because they used the good jelly, the schmucker\u2019s. So nobody\u2019s paying me to confess this now and I\u2019ve kept it under wraps for all these years because I knew that no one would believe me. No one would believe that Questrade ate my asshole.", "created_utc": 1585889586.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fu219l/questrade_exposed/", "is_self": true}
