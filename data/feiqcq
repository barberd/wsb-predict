If the virus continues to spread in densely populated areas, what are our options when facilities fill up?\n\nAnd the doctors responded with:\n\n>Like any other country, we have a limited number of ventilators. IF this virus gets to that, we'll have to make some tough decisions. This is why it's important for the public to do their part and self quarantine, if necessary. But the government is taking steps to increase manufacturing capability / pace of ventilators. -Dr. Torres and Dr. Fair\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNaturally, that got me thinking about how I can make money while this virus dicks down the entire world. I did some quality DD for this sub, a 5 minute google search, and was able to find this article about what companies produce ventilators. If this gay ass virus is as bad as it seems, the government will most likely have to contract these corporations:\n\n[https://meticulousblog.org/top-10-companies-in-global-ventilators-market/](https://meticulousblog.org/top-10-companies-in-global-ventilators-market/)\n\nOnly one of these is an American company, so the rest can fuck off. Becton, Dickinson and Company has a subsidiary, called CareFusion Corporation, that produces ventilators for the medical field. So, it would make sense to buy calls for this company. This achieves several things:\n\n1. We get to stop being gay ass bears\n2. We get to play off of the virus hysteria\n3. They dropped in value along with the rest of the market, making it a good buy\n4. The company is literally called Dickinson, which, coincidentally, mods love doing to their children (Dick-in-son)\n\nP.S. yes, I am gay and retarded.
