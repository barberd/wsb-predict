{"id": "hbkmf2", "title": "DD: BYND 2.0??", "selftext": "\"The Very Good Butchers\" (VERY) company located in BC Canada just ipo'd on the CSE (Canadian Securities Exchange) today. What is the Canadian Securities Exchange I hear you asking? I have no idea even though I'm Canadian.. seems like some kind of penny stock exchange. So we know what happened with BYND stock.. plant based businesses are the cat's meow right now. VERY essentially copied the Herbivorous Butchers business model but in Canada. They make mock meat products. It just so happened that I ordered a full sample box from VERY a few months ago for 100$+ to try all their products. They shipped it refrigerated across Canada, I'm in Quebec, and it got here pretty quickly and nicely packaged. Some of the \"meats\" were ok and some not so good but some were excellent. One of the pepperonis or sausages was so good you could have easily given it to a meat eater and they wouldn't have known.\n\nObviously the title of this post is hyperbolic and unfortunately I don't think there are any options but it's a penny stock so you can still make crazy returns. Also probably not available to US investors.\n\nI have no idea about their financials but I grabbed 10k worth this morning", "created_utc": 1592506744.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hbkmf2/dd_bynd_20/", "is_self": true}
