Financial freedom that will allows us to improve our quality of life, and help the people we love and care about.\n\nSee trading is all about probability, like you have to calculate statistic and stuff to get in on a move that will most likely go your way. Let's face it, there's less then 1 in a million chance that you'll be like /u/dhsmatt2. For myself, I've never even heard about purple mattresses before. And even following the prophet \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b /u/dlkdev/ DD does not give an accurate enough time for you to buy puts and profit.\n\nThus I've been using my big brain to think this stuff out.....\n\nAutist been dissing on boomer-saurus Buffet, but none of you is worth 70 Billion yet, so......\n\nI've been digging around, and found that Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway is not actually  a hedge fund but an insurance company ! None of the big hedge fund guys like Ackman and Bill Gross are that rich. What does an insurance company do ? They collect premiums ! Premiums are like small gains but they are very consistent, you get to collect them regularly. How can we in **2nd semester of 2020**  emulate Berkshire Hathaway business model  when we don't have bazillions and thousands of people slaving under us ?\n\n**Write 0 DTE/ Near DTE OTM SPY Calls !**\n\nI've been selling naked calls since June 10th, and it worked every time !!!\n\n>Drill Team 6, please protect the naked calls I wrote today, just until AoC speaks\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/haof9a/daily\\_discussion\\_thread\\_for\\_june\\_17\\_2020/fv4fybu?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/haof9a/daily_discussion_thread_for_june_17_2020/fv4fybu?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)\n\n>Buh bye autist, thanks for buying my calls today.\n\n[https://redd.it/h0kibv](https://redd.it/h0kibv)\n\nAnd I even conducted a scientific survey here to reaffirm my suspicions\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hajmsl/ive\\_never\\_seen\\_any\\_autist\\_post\\_consistent\\_options/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hajmsl/ive_never_seen_any_autist_post_consistent_options/)\n\nIf you go to a bank and deposit your money, the bank will only give you like 0.25% interest per year  (Thanks JPOW). If you write calls and collect premium even on out of money calls the return you get is about 1-3% of your capital for only a few days, say worst case you collect 1% every 2 days, 1 year is 252 trading days, within a year you'll be making 252/2 x 1% = 125% ROI !!!!!\n\nWhy nobody here have thought about this before I don't know, I guess you guys really are retarded.\n\n**TL,DR : Market Top, Write Near DTE OTM SPY Calls !**\n\n**Edit : And use the premium tendies to roll your puts**", "created_utc": 1592446631.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hb5ofw/hewooo_retards_carebear_here_sharing_with_you/", "is_self": true}
