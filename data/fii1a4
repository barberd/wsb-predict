Currently holding SPY 245p 3/23, GILD 81c 3/27, SPY 285c 3/30, BA 140p 4/24, BA 145p 5/25. Bought the BA puts yesterday at open so they are doing pretty decently.\n\nAs we all are currently observing, the bearish sentiment is the highest it has ever been. We know too well what the fuck happens when this phenomenon takes place. One-way sentiment is even stronger than during the \u2018stonks only go up\u2019 dynasty. We literally have people picking a stock, tagging DD and posting \u201cSHORT ____\u201d. Every fucking chart looks the same - THATS NOT DD. It\u2019s just a super long, super skinny red dildo.  \n\nLook, I still think we have a bit more to go down. Here\u2019s why: People are still not taking this virus seriously enough.  Everyone still has the \u201ccan\u2019t happen to me\u201d mentality. \u201cNot here because shit like this doesn\u2019t happen to me!\u201d This is extremely dangerous thinking and it\u2019s the reason why the virus will spread quickly. *Most* of us have lived our lives with almost no relative hardship. Welp, here comes a test and we are failing miserably at it. Millennial fucks (I am one) lack the foresight to understand that, sure, this virus will just get them a bit sick and they will be ok, but it might kill their parents, their friend\u2019s parents, grandparents, etc. \n\nIn closing (that last paragraph kind of got away from me, I\u2019m sorry), when a reversal does happen - and it will happen, completely unexpectedly at that, it will wipe out beargang as we know it. I\u2019m not talking about an event like yesterday in the market. I\u2019m talking like 4 days in a row like yesterday. It\u2019s coming boys, just be careful out there.", "created_utc": 1584191020.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fii1a4/tread_cautiously_gang/", "is_self": true}
