It\u2019s going to be a while before any industry sees significant and widespread support from Congress.  Dems are not going to give a Republican President a re-election.\n\n&nbsp;\n \nListen up autists. Gather around while I teach you about the political process.\n\n \n&nbsp; \n\nLet\u2019s get the basics out of the way.\n\n \n 1. Congress controls the purse strings and laws\n\n 2. Executive branch can only execute what is within the scope of the law\n\n 3. House of Reps controlled by Democrats (235D, 200D)\n\n 4. Senate controlled by Republicans (53R, 45D, 2I)\n\n 5. It is a Presidential election year\n\n \n&nbsp;\n\n####Here is what has happened so far \u2013 two bills have been worked out.  One has passed, one is awaiting Senate vote:\n\n \n\n1)    Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act: [HR 6074](https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/hr6074/BILLS-116hr6074enr.pdf)\n\n* Status: Signed into law March 6th\n\n* Major Components:\n\n * Total of $8.3B for federal agencies to respond to coronavirus outbreak\n\n * $3B for vaccine R&D\n\n * $2.2B for public health preparedness and response\n\n * $1B for medical supplies\n\n * $1.25B to help fight coronavirus internationally\n\n&nbsp;\n\n2)    Families First Coronavirus Response Act: [HR 6201](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6201)\n\n* Status: This bill has passed the House and is awaiting from a Senate vote.  Senate vote is expected this week and is expected to pass the Senate.  It is not law yet and therefore nothing in the bill can be executed.\n\n* Major components:\n\n * $8B for coronavirus testing (Let\u2019s be super clear about this, Congress is asking for $8B to pay for tests.  Those testing kits have not been procured yet.)\n\n * $900M in food assistance to WIC and TEFAP\n\n * $5M to administer for paid sick leave (I don\u2019t know how $5M is going to cover the costs\u2026)\n\n * You can find the rest of the details [here](https://appropriations.house.gov/sites/democrats.appropriations.house.gov/files/Families%20First%20summary.pdf)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow what about that tasty $850B stimulus package?\n\n \n\n 1. The White House and Senate leadership are working together on the stimulus bill.  Sounds like good news right?  Wrong.\n\n 2. The White House went directly to Senate Republicans to work out a deal.\n\n 3. The Senate will draft a bill with $850B going to support banks and large corporations. \n\n 4. Senate will pass the bill along party lines and send it to the House.\n 5. The House will likely draft their own bill that is lower in spending and is directed at funding medical issues, families, sick leave, etc.\n\n 6. The House has zero interest in supporting a bill that could save the economy and help Trump win a second term.\n\n 7. House Democrats also know that this coronavirus shit will end at some point and if they can time the recovery for just after the election, they can ride a wave of other Dem victories and possibly take the Senate in addition to the White House.\n\n&nbsp; \n\n##Bottom line- politics is going to fuck us hard before they get around to helping us.", "created_utc": 1584470730.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkam9o/politics_for_autists/", "is_self": true}
