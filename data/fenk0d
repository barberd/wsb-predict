{"id": "fenk0d", "title": "1-6 Months", "selftext": "I have pulled out a loan for 6.8k to play around with robinhood. I have decided that within this time period if I lose it all, I am \"leaving\" and won't be \"back\" I have been lonely and miserable for about 2 years, working at a company that makes me barely feel accomplished. I have tried school, and felt even worse about my life eventually taking a break after a term. I live in a storage pantry (although dont pay rent) makes me feel even worse about life. I am so obsessed with options it effects me with being social, I can't even talk to girls or get a long lasting relationship. \n\nMy family is a giant circus and it makes me even worse. I have talked with several psychiatrists about my problems, which help but I need money to actually feel accomplished on what I want to do with my life and feel sucessful. I don't care about lambos and retarded stuff. After loosing 5k from my last investments I was just jumping into trades, and making an insane amount but it all broke lose after msft the downturn. I took a 2 week break and started studying technical analysis and realizing how things react. \n\nFor those of you worried about me not affording the loan, I thought about this really hard. This loan will actually build my credit, and is affordable for monthly payments. But I hate living my life that I am living. I am also using donchian channels and the williams %r indicators to figure out when to buy calls and puts. I am also a PDT on robinhood, so I have to swing trade all my options or have enough to create margin of 25k or more. No this is not a made up situation although I wish it was.\n\nTLDR; I am dipping out of life, if my 6.8k loan I got reaches 0 or makes me depressed enough.\n\nBlown account\nhttps://imgur.com/a/CXe0mt1\n\nFood pantry living \nhttps://imgur.com/a/THwmUrw", "created_utc": 1583542836, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fenk0d/16_months/", "is_self": true}
