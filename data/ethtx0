{"id": "ethtx0", "title": "SPCE Bear = Tardigrade", "selftext": "I posted this elsewhere, but I'm tired of seeing posts about SPCE.\n\nThis company has spent 15 years doing jackshit - literally they have 1 plane. You know whose moved faster than these guys?   \n\\- SpaceX (founded 2002) landed rockets on goddamn boats  \n\\- Facebook (founded 2004) figured out how to destroy democracy  \n\\- THE ENTIRE SMARTPHONE INDUSTRY STARTED 3 YEARS LATER  \n\\- America elected both a non-white person AND a reality TV star as president.\n\nFor crying out loud, a new Half Life is landing before these guys actually launch their service.\n\nMy point here is that this team has literally shat the bed for 15 years, I'm not sure what makes you think &lt;i&gt;now&lt;i&gt; of all times they're magically going to get their act together.\n\nBut maybe you believe that the revenue opportunity is massive - and they're just on the cusp of raking in all that cash.   \n\\- SPCE has disclosed that they have ONE working plane. They have another that maybe they'll have by some time next year. They plan for 5 by 2023.  \n\\- They have plans for hypersonic travel - but thats more than 5 years out.  \n\\- At max they have 5 people flying per flight. They only make profit after the 2nd one, so you can back into at least how many flights they can have with their current list of 600. And any partially filled flights are going to drag on their margin.  \n\\- Also any unexpected maintenance really fucks with earnings when you have ONLY ONE PLANE.   \n\n\nBUT here's the rub - the really interesting bit is that they had to go through this SPAC process because they were running out of cash, and Richard Branson was tired of throwing his own money into a pit. What's crazy here is that instead of doing normal things (raising capital through an IPO, doing a round with any of the massive VC firms that clearly love pissing away money, raising debt, or looking for to be acquired) they opted for essentially a direct listing.  \n\n\nWhy do it this way?   \n1) They probably couldn't raise the money (let that sink in - WeWork was probably a more convincing business model than this shit)   \n2) No one wanted to buy their IP (likely because its super nascent and all the decent engineering companies thought it was not worth the amount Richard Branson spent)  \n3) The easiest people to feed this garbage to are retail investors too dumb to do research. \n\n  \nAND LASTLY:   \nGo to their fucking website. They're shilling Microsoft Edge. Any company that &lt;i&gt;proudly&lt;i&gt; boasts how deeply they've partnered with Edge does not instill any confidence in their technical prowess.   \nThat isn't a joke: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?time\\_continue=94&amp;v=uvWrirMnZEs&amp;feature=emb\\_logo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=94&amp;v=uvWrirMnZEs&amp;feature=emb_logo)\n\nGet out while you can, or join me with puts on this BS.", "created_utc": 1579905296, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ethtx0/spce_bear_tardigrade/", "is_self": true}
