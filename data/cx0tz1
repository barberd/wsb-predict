{"id": "cx0tz1", "title": "Morning Briefing (8/29/2019)", "selftext": "# Futures market excited by calm remarks\n\nU.S. equity futures have jumped on conciliatory trade remarks from China, although Beijing stopped short of confirming if it will hold off on retaliatory tariffs. The S&amp;P 500 futures are up 28 points and trade 1.0% above fair value.\u00a0\n\nChina's Ministry of Commerce spokesman, Gao Feng, indicated the U.S. should withdraw plans for new tariffs and said both sides should create conditions for progress in trade negotiations. According to\u00a0*Reuters*, Mr. Gao did not answer directly if his remarks suggested that Beijing would not retaliate against the latest tariff threat from the U.S.\u00a0\n\nEvidently, the futures market is liking China's softer stance today while the two sides continue to discuss a timetable for September trade talks.\n\nEarnings reports since yesterday's close have featured more retail results.\u00a0**Dollar Tree** (**DLTR** 106.00, +6.40, +6.4%) and **Dollar General** (**DG** 150.20, +9.17, +6.5%) are up following their results, while\u00a0**Best Buy** (**BBY** 64.90, -4.10, -5.9%) drops on mixed results and guidance.\u00a0\n\nOn the data front, investors will receive the second estimate for Q2 GDP (Briefing.com consensus 2.0%); the weekly Initial Claims (Briefing.com consensus 215,000) and Continuing Claims report; and the advance reports for International Trade in Goods, Retail Inventories, and Wholesale Inventories for July at 8:30 a.m. ET. Pending Home Sales for July (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) will be released at 10:00 a.m. ET.\u00a0\n\nU.S. Treasuries have edged lower, pushing yields higher across the curve.
