{"id": "g6az6h", "title": "ORLY Earnings Discussion", "selftext": "Haven't seen many people talking about ORLY  \n\n\nA few odd things about their earnings. Their stock bumped up after hours by about 6% AH before their earnings came out then proceeded to jig saw back and forth between the closing price and +6%. Really strange considering that by that time they hadn't even posted their earnings yet and it continued to jigsaw despite missing earnings. Possibly due to low volume and a single highly motivated buyer, but also possible that it's stock buybacks from the company trying to trigger an AH buy leading into earnings. \n\nWhich brings my to my next point. Looking through their past earnings reports they have approved billions in stock buybacks which are undoubtedly underwater right now. They have at least 5,219 stores which are currently closed or at best operating under limited conditions. Their entire business is centered around automobile maintenance and no one in the US is driving right now. They are also a relatively seasonal company (check their last 4 earnings, they perform better in warmer months due to increased driving).   \n\n\nCan someone explain to me why I'm an idiot for getting puts on this company?  \n\n\n280p 5/15", "created_utc": 1587594757.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6az6h/orly_earnings_discussion/", "is_self": true}
