{"id": "g9pv4q", "title": "EURN is a MUCH better bet than NAT", "selftext": "Jim Cramer recently declared \"NAT has the largest fleet in the world\" - an absurdly false statement (NAT has a MUCH smaller fleet than nearly every peer), and several youtubers made videos about NAT. Shares have traded far beyond what they are worth and I am expecting a big correction.\n\nI have followed the tanker space for a long time, and wanted to say that EURONAV (EURN) is the company you want to own. EURONAV actually DOES have one of the largest fleets in the world (About 4x that of the NAT fleet). They are also MUCH better capitalized and committed to returning 80% OF ALL PROFITS to shareholders. They have been less dilutive (NAT constantly issues equity in pump and dump schemes) and own 43 of the VERY LARGE CRUDE CARRIERS that you're seeing in the news headlines, wheras NAT owns ZERO VLCCs.\n\nIf you're interested in the ALL TIME RECORD earnings in the oil tanker space, give EURN some consideration! It's less than fairly valued and is one of the best positioned names in the space. Others I recommend based on valuation and fleet profile:\n\nOET (Norway)\nHUNT (Norway)\nDSSI (US - mixed crude / products)\nSTNG (US - pure products)", "created_utc": 1588089675.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9pv4q/eurn_is_a_much_better_bet_than_nat/", "is_self": true}
