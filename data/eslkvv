Plus, their STONK went up past 2 earnings so third times the charm ya twats.\n\nYou might ask why you should listen to me, and you should not, but im shorting this gay ass motherfucker with some 57 strike FAGGIE ds **BUT** on FRIDAY.\n\nIV is a tendie enemy number 1, so dont get jebaited by getting your sweet sweet 0.03 55 strike 01/24 pooties tomorrow. GET 57 STRIKE POOTS THEM AFTER IV DOES ITS CUCKING, ON FRIDAY AT OPEN ( or maybe wait like idk 2-3 mins for it to bull trap)\n\nEither way fellas, I'll see you later at Tendieville", "created_utc": 1579741860, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eslkvv/ultimate_intel_earnings_play/", "is_self": true}
