I decided to go with Global X MSCI Pakistan ETF on Robinhood. It's expense ratios are incredibly higher than all my other funds (mainly VTSAX, VTIAX, VBTLX). Global X MSCI Pakistan ETF has an expense ratio of 0.87%.\n\nSo far I've lost money on this fund. My holdings in the fund are less than 1% of my net worth. I'm seeing that Pakistan is finalizing a bailout with the IMF and also has loans from China and investments from Saudi Arabia. I'm expecting in 3-5 years this may help raise the stock value, unless Pakistan defaults. What does everyone else think? Is Pakistan a good bet or am I autistic?", "created_utc": 1557000509, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bkp870/is_pakistan_a_good_bet_or_am_i_autistic/", "is_self": true}
