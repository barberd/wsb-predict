{"id": "e7h72m", "title": "$PCG growing more and more likely to exit bankruptcy", "selftext": "So I saw that few people were mentioning this in any DD form of way, so I thought I'd share some speculative opportunities with my fellow degenerates  \n\n\nI've been playing PCG for past several weeks with selling puts and covered calls for some easy 5-10% gains weekly as a theta gang strategy  \n\n\nThe reason PCG has been so high IV is the stock literally swings 15-30% daily and often on random mood swings. The company declared bankruptcy a while back when it realized it was not going to be able to handle the sheer number of liabilities and over the past several months, it has been given a deadline of exiting bankruptcy by June 2020.  \n\n\nTo exit bankruptcy, it needs to take care of all existing liabilities from previous wildfires, which includes insurance payouts, bond holder payouts, and wildfire victim payouts. The bearish view is the liabilities which can be 30-40B are far exceeding what PCG can actually pay, and as a business this thing is going to be unlikely and unable to raise more debt or get funding. It will be forced to dilute like crazy and wipe out equity holders and even then unclear if anybody would buy the new equity. Another risk is there is a big push to have the company be taken over and run as a state managed utility.  \n\n\nThe bullish view is the value of their assets, long term revenue, and potential as a company means this is far undervalued if it can exit bankruptcy. Additionally the likelihood of the state taking on the massive recurrent fire liabilities let alone managing a utility is unlikely (SF can barely manage BART, why would it take on power electric grids)  \n\n\nAdditionally there are competing proposals on exiting bankruptcy between how they favor wildfire victims, bondholders, and equity holders. Bond holders obviously want to get paid first, but gov't won't allow that if wildfire victims are left bag holding  \n\n\nEquity holders have little voice and have been viewed as most likely to get screwed if they own common stock  \n\n\nMost recently they were negotiating a large sum of pay out for the Tubbs fire wildfire victims with the expectation they would need to have a big trial in January to determine liabilities.  \n\n\nI'd expected to be able to keep playing off volatility and selling puts through March because there was so much uncertainty but things have moved quickly since then  \n\n\nThey recently managed to reach a settlement on paying 13.5B to the wildfire victims as a mix of cash and shares. While the government is posturing and stating they aren't happy, it's ultimately posturing in my opinion (given the governor has had deep pockets with PCG lobbying him and funding his wive's films, plus he's one of the only political officials who has not actually returned this money in California despite being questioned about it, at least others had the thought to donate it to charity for fire victims if not returning it)  \n\n\nIf the judge approves this settlement it effectively sets an upper bound on wild fire liabilities for PCG and also means the january trial is eliminated. This removes a lot of uncertainty on the total amount of liabilities PCG will be dealing with and also means there is less dilution necessary since original forecasts had the total sum potentially exceeding 23-25B for wild fire victims (due to lawyers trying to wring them dry)  \n\n\nI'll keep selling puts and making option premium but will likely put a small speculative sum in my 401k on PCG, there's a much better chance this thing can exit bankruptcy and return to it's previous highs of 24-40$ a share  \n\n\nNote the long term risks remain of wildfires, but it does seem like reform on tactics to avoid fires are becoming a bigger priority with settlements including some measures to invest in preventative tactics (though realistically the company could never afford to make all it's exposed live wires across California go underground, the cost is easily 50-80B dollars estimated by them)", "created_utc": 1575740326, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e7h72m/pcg_growing_more_and_more_likely_to_exit/", "is_self": true}
