After seeing the price, you're probably wondering who in the world would spend that much money to gild a comment/post, and what kind of content would be worthy of it. \n\nTo my surprise, many posts/comments have been given the expensive award over the months. I decided to start keeping track of it after seeing the first one awarded. Sadly it doesn't show up when sorting posts by gilded unless it is accompanied by platinum or gold. Reddit hasn't responded to or updated this even though the GFB costs 40,000 coins.\n\nHere is a list of posts/comments that were given the award:\n\nNumber|Recipient|Description|Gilded by|Running total\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n1|u/haupt91|[Meme](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/djmm9o/in_the_land_of_china/)|u/riskit4debiscuit|$99.99\n2|u/ControlTheNarrative|[Live stream of ~$50k loss.
