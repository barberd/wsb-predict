But you seem to forget that this is the stock market, so there is a trick for every single thing, and even you can do what JPow is cooking, that is converting absolute losses to maximum gains. If you have bought a SPY 4/17 230p, simply sell a SPY 4/3 230p. By doing that, you are capturing back losses whenever the market jumps. If you think after 4/3 that the market is going to absolute shit, then simply buy back the put and let your 4/17 put rides into the sunset. \n\nTLDR: If you want to regain your losses when the market acts stupid, sell a put at the same strike price you have with a one-week out expiration. This is a put calendar spread. \n\nExample: Buy a SPY 4/17 230p \n\nSell a SPY 4/3 230p \n\nIf you're sure that after 4/3 the market is going to absolutely tank, then do not purchase anymore put and just let your 4/17 put rides. By doing this, you're limiting losses and the integrity of your lottery ticket is secured.", "created_utc": 1585338842.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fq4a9w/if_you_are_too_damn_stubborn_to_withstand_the/", "is_self": true}
