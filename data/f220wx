{"id": "f220wx", "title": "Opinions on Technical analysis?", "selftext": "I\u2019m relatively new to trading (new as of last fall but I\u2019ve been a gay boi \u201cInVEStinG\u201d for years now) and I may come off as a bit retarded so please pardon me in advance. Anyways, I see a lot \u201cgurus\u201d on YouTube, dudes on reddit, various ads, etc about people claiming that technical analysis actually works. I feel like in the broad aspect (a few weeks, months, and years) basic technical analysis actually makes some logic sense but anything super complex and less than a week or intraday seems completely useless. Logically in these small time frames, how would it be possible to predict these tiny incremental price movements with most likely no fundamental backing? You\u2019re pretty much just banking on a large group of people/Algo trading in what seems like some sort of pattern which will then somehow correlate to some sort of future predictable direction. The only possible way I can see short term technical analysis holding any merit is because a bunch of dudes/algo are watching for the same patterns and then trading based on the predicted pattern\u2019s outcome which in turn may actually drive the underlying\u2019s price into that direction. \n\nTL:DR Opinions on technical analysis? I just buy what this subreddit tells me to anyways but I\u2019m curios \n\nP.s.
