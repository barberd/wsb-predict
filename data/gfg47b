As a result, Cisco stock provides an attractive dividend.     \n\n   \n\nCorporate spending on information technology was expected to plunge due to COVID - BUT IT HASN'T.\n\nThere's a long-term view. Cisco could go shopping once the dust settles and make the kind of big, transformational acquisition that some have been looking for.   \n   \n\n\nIn the January quarter, Cisco's fiscal second quarter, the company paid a cash dividend of $1.5 billion and bought back $870 million of its own shares. Cisco stock had some $27 billion in cash and equivalents. In 2019, Cisco reduced debt by some $5 billion. Heading into the April quarter, Cisco had about $12 billion remaining in a stock repurchase program.     \n    \n\n\nIn its glory days from a 1990 initial public offering through early 2000, Cisco thrived as a major supplier of the hardware to build internet networks, both to telecom firms and large companies outside that sector. Cisco stock soared more than 100,000% in that period, before the dot.com bubble burst.\n     \n     \n\nMore recently, after a breakout in October 2017, Cisco stock gained 70% through mid-July 2019.      \n    \n\n\n\nBut CSCO stock swooned in the latter half of 2019. It plunged like most tech stocks in the coronavirus-driven market correction. The upper echelon tech stocks are providing strong bounce backs to the rest of the market. CSCO should be no different, infact - with upside for more growth than the company has seen in the last 10 years. They're more diverse in cloud computing services, software, and equipment.   \n   \n\n  \n\n\nThe tech industry icon is shifting away from its core business of selling network switches and routers. With acquisitions, Cisco has aimed to increase revenue from software and services.     \n\n     \n   \n\nBefore the coronavirus emergency, management has stated that 30% of all revenue would come from software in fiscal 2020, up from 22% in 2017.      \n     \nTL;DR  \n05/29 50C   \n05/15 44C", "created_utc": 1588888468.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gfg47b/cisco_systems_csco/", "is_self": true}
