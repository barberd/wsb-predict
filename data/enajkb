{"id": "enajkb", "title": "Trucking &amp; 3PL", "selftext": "Im in the transportation industry, truckload freight. 2019 was a brutal year. Many carriers went under due to low rates and brokers margins were compressed due to the competitive environment. \n\nBrokers and carriers alike were rattled by an unexpected volatile market at the end of q4. 3pl stonks are all reporting earnings at end of month. \n\nI am a rates analyst at a mid sized 3pl. Based on what ive seen in q4, everyone is going to report weak q4 earnings. \n\nMight be a good time to buy shares since we are at or near the bottom, but puts ahead of earnings at end of this month would be a nice gamble. \n\nearnings from q4 will be bad for echo, ch Robinson, and coyote. Not sure about xpo since they do a lot of last mile which might have been better than truckload due to ecommerce. \n\nThe risk is that one of them will come out and say they think the market will improve in 2020 and stonks will go up, but most dont do this. CHRW never gives market guidance. Coyote publishes their predictions and is more likely to. Its called coyote curve.\n\nGood luck out there folks.", "created_utc": 1578764855, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/enajkb/trucking_3pl/", "is_self": true}
