{"id": "g2g58c", "title": "Wealth Simple is Trash", "selftext": "So I decided to recently try stock trading for the first time and decided to go with wealth simple as its one of the few options we Canadians have to trade on the stock market. Other alternatives like Robbin Hood are not available to us, and bank investment portfolios still charge commission fees. I tied once before to set up an account with Quest Trade but it requires verification over the phone and I found it to be too restrictive on who even gets accepted for an account. They keep showing commercials on TV for Wealth Simple as a platformed designed for anyone of any income bracket.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI gotta say my experience is not great so far, there are far more bugs in the app then I expected and way way more bugs then I'd like to have for an app where I am moving actual money around. As far as I can tell there is no way within the app to move money between TFSA and a personal account I would like to so that I can day trade and not get in trouble with the CRA for day trading on a TFSA. The website says you can do that on the computer but when I log into the computer I see a totally different account then the one on my phone. I ended up accidentally moving $400 into a general purpose savings account on the computer which I can not buy and sell stocks from and I cant see that money on my phone which has a separate $200 for day trading.\n\nThe numbers on the phone are ping ponging all over the place. I currently have - $172 available for trading for some unknown reason. I bought 50 shares of one stock and it currently shows me having 100 shares. I can't tell if I am up or down because the share count if off and the app thinks I doubled my investment overnight.\n\nI was watching one stock yesterday that was showing a %1700 increase. It was roughly $6 in value and had only gone up a few cents but the app thought the stock price went from less then a dollar to over $6 even though the 52 week low was $5 not $0.35.\n\nSome stocks just cant be bought because after placing an order it just sits for over an hour yet placing an order on some other stock goes through in seconds. The day graph charts don't appear on some stocks or are wildly inaccurate even given the 15 minute delay.\n\nThis app is an absolute mess.", "created_utc": 1587048051.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2g58c/wealth_simple_is_trash/", "is_self": true}
