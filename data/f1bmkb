{"id": "f1bmkb", "title": "The Real Reason why BYND meat will fail as a company...", "selftext": "Listen here boomers, have some common sense. Beyond meat is an oxymoron of a product and it's ultimate path is one of irrelevancy and decline. The product purports to be an alternative to meat, however we already have alternatives to meat, its called vegetables. Veggie burgers have been a thing since forever. A real health conscious person would not get this grey area uncanny meat, they would simply go whole foods plant based diet. Why would a KFC sh\\*tty fast food customer want fake chicken? They are chicken eaters, thats why they are customers in the first place. Its moronic and oxymoronic at the same time. So meat eaters don't want it, real vegans don't want it, only dumb teenage girls want it for now until the trend blows over. Who is this product aimed at? Everybody and nobody at the same time. \n\nMark my words, this stock will peter out. Maybe not this week, or this quarter, but once first time customer curiosity blows over, sales decline, competition increases, and health fads move on... this will be a dud.", "created_utc": 1581268528, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f1bmkb/the_real_reason_why_bynd_meat_will_fail_as_a/", "is_self": true}
