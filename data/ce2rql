{"id": "ce2rql", "title": "Robinhood Options API/Command Line. Lose money automatically.", "selftext": "Hi all,\nThere are a few Robinhood API\u2019s on github, but they all seem to lack the ability to trade options. I only trade options, because naturally I\u2019m retarded, so I had to go about making a new Robinhood API on my own. The API includes a complete command line tool to watch your open positions, to find options, to do automatic stop loss on open positions (lol right), and more. I have nothing to gain from making this public, except maybe a few autists approaching Chapter 7 bankruptcy by my side, but I figured I\u2019d make it public for the greater good. Feel free to put in a pull request to contribute and help others lose money faster!\n[Robinhood Yolo](http://github.com/edmundpf/robinhood_yolo)", "created_utc": 1563309876, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ce2rql/robinhood_options_apicommand_line_lose_money/", "is_self": true}
