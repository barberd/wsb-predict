It has more than doubled its value since then through acquisitions and revenue growth, but it\u2019s still got a long way to run. This company has a focus on video sharing based on three things: animation, comics, and gaming. Their main offering is a Tik Tok-like platform where you can create your own original videos \u2013 or more often, submit your own video with someone else\u2019s content dubbed over it. Addictive shit you can catch yourself watching for two hours on accident if you\u2019re not careful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBilibili is also based on a freemium model. You can anonymously view some of their shit videos for free as much as you\u2019d like while being bombarded with ads. Or, you can upgrade to a premium account to watch more exclusive videos with higher quality and less ads. The company also offers a further \u201cbig member\u201d level of membership, which gives you access to early releases of premium content, discounts to single-payment content, as well as aesthetic upgrades for your profile. Think Twitch subs/Fortnite skins. Shit your 12-year-old brother stole mom\u2019s credit card for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe company also offers casual mobile games and opportunities for social interaction through their platform (this is the kicker because of the next bit). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*ACTUAL BULL CASE\\*\\*:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, that\u2019s the boring shit. \\*\\*The important thing is this\\*\\*: Coronavirus is keeping the people of China indoors, and it\u2019s not an issue localized to Wuhan. Some estimates say that the ten most populous cities in China are down to about 10% of their normal road traffic on any given day, and these numbers are not growing week over week yet. Others say only 25% of the workforce has come back to work. \\[Source even though you\u2019re not going to click it.\\](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2020/02/20/coronavirus-impact-has-china-really-returned-to-work/#13943ac47728) The Chinese government is installing barricades at the entrances to apartment buildings in an effort to keep people from leaving. I don\u2019t know about you, but if I\u2019m stuck in my fucking apartment for weeks on end, I\u2019m whipping out my phone and getting some entertainment in. And advertisers know that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf the numbers we\u2019re seeing are accurate, this virus has the legs to keep the Chinese boarded up for a long time. The SARS outbreak lasted 8 months, and the coronavirus has many indications that it is far worse than that. Eight months is a hell of a long time to be consuming video content. On top of that, Bilibili has been offering free \u201cconcerts\u201d on their platform due to the virus outbreak and has publicly been donating medical supplies to the state. How generous.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBilibili reports earnings on 3/16, and I\u2019ll be damned if they don\u2019t blow their expectations out of the water. 3/20 calls are relatively inexpensive and could be extremely lucrative if the momentum of this company continues. $30 if you\u2019re a believer, $35 if ya nasty. There is no reason it shouldn\u2019t moon regardless; you should just buy the damn things.", "created_utc": 1582294909, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7bqwq/bilibili_bili_also_known_as_b_site_or_the_only/", "is_self": true}
