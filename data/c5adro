[~~#~~**Beyondmeat**](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Beyondmeat?src=hash) shares shorted increased by +529k shs,+9.77%, over the last week as its stock price fell -17.05%.\n\nThis is up from 113% on borrows yesterday and 170-275% rates on new borrows yesterday. So heading in the right direction for a short squeeze. Obviously that hasn't materialized yet. \n\nAlso, thanks to   [Chrysopa\\_Perla](https://www.reddit.com/user/Chrysopa_Perla) for posting the following article about how BYND's inclusion in the Russell 1000 index will force ETFs that track that index to buy shares by June 28th. By this author's estimates, it will create 2.6m shares worth of demand in the next 3 days, or approximately 24% of the entire float. \n\n[https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4271912-etf-effect-beyond-meat-enters-strong-flows](https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4271912-etf-effect-beyond-meat-enters-strong-flows)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am still holding my August calls with the expectation that a short squeeze occurs in the next few weeks, but in the past couple weeks I've definitely been wrong.", "created_utc": 1561477190, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c5adro/bynd_updated_borrow_rates_and_forced_etf_buying/", "is_self": true}
