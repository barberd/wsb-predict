Far OTM puts or calls are at risk of expiring below breakeven without option to exercise.\n\nIf RH typically accounts for 10% of average daily US market orders, for example, how much more would the market be tanking if today's orders were allowed to execute, assuming a majority were puts on SPY and calls on VIX?", "created_utc": 1583773203, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffxsne/robinhood_did_not_crash_you_just_cant_sell_or/", "is_self": true}
