It signed multiple contracts with Telecom providers in various countries (Predominantly the one that are allied with the US)\n\nIt released an AD on YouTube that is just... Wow (PLEASE WATCH)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/0CP13u68_MY\n\n\nI checked their website (https://www.ericsson.com/en/5g) and it was very informative however I autistic and I need a video explanation. The National (God bless Canada) made a very very informative video about the impacts of 5G (https://youtu.be/bub2iCRkyLE)  Also, as I did more research and Nokia has surpassed Huawei with the number of orders for it's 5G equipment. So long $NOK too! \n\n\nTLDR: imagine a world where you could suck your boyfriend's dick without leaving work. That's the power of VR with the help of 5G. This is the equivalent of Gay strip clubs in the 60s, get in.\n\nSorry if this wasn't a very indept DD but I recommend doing your own research and see the major upsides.
