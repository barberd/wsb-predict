{"id": "dxf3aa", "title": "A serious post: Long term short on Adient (ADNT)", "selftext": "Hi Folks, \n\nAdient is a company that designs and sells automotive seating. Its stock has been taking a beating recently, but when you look at their gross margins, you realize that the company only generates around 100 million free cash flow, but it's being valued at 1.9 billion market cap. In reality, the stock price should be more around 5-7 dollars a share. I believe that this stock will go down in value in the years to come, especially with dwindling demands in China (which is ADNT's largest market). The slowing of demand for ADNT's products may be further catalyzed by an incoming recession. This, of course, is a very long term play. I'm buying puts with an expiration at 2021 and I believe that it's a good strategy for any of you mortals who actually want to make a profit instead of just YOLOing your money on out of the money puts/calls that don't make sense. If any of you want more info on my analysis, let me know.", "created_utc": 1573949416, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dxf3aa/a_serious_post_long_term_short_on_adient_adnt/", "is_self": true}
