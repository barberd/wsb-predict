{"id": "fxvyu9", "title": "Update from the hotel guy on the industry", "selftext": "Been a while and for those that missed my last post just a little background \n\nI\u2019m the owner and operator of 26 hotels located in 6 states all of them upper mid scale franchised hotels from Marriott, Hilton, IHG and Hyatt. \n\nAs you can imagine the last month has been unlike anything I would have ever thought possible. 80 plus percent revenue declines year over year. Most of my hotels are running 20% occupancy or less. \n\nBut here\u2019s the bottom line. This is survivable for most of us providing we start to see even a modest turn around in the next 3-4 months which I think will happen. \n\nIf you had asked me a month ago I would have said all the hotel owners are going broke. But I\u2019ve spent the last month working day and night to do the following things as have the other CEOs in my shoes and I can tell you this is something most are going to make it through without having to raise a significant amount of equity so dilution shouldn\u2019t be a big concern. \n\nHere is why \n\n- I\u2019ve cut 80% of my payroll. \n- I\u2019ve renegotiated all of my debt and have been given interest rate reductions, deferred payments, interest only and access to my reserve accounts as well as waiving loan covenants that I keep certain debt coverage ratios. \n- I\u2019ve closed my restaurants, pools, fitness centers and breakfast \n- I\u2019ve negotiated utility contracts and other vendor payments for steep discounts over the next few months \n- I\u2019ve gotten relief from the franchise in the form of fees and other requirements \n- I\u2019m working with hospitals, health departments and other government agencies to provide hotels for them to use \n- I have obtained millions of dollars in payroll protection loans from the CARES act. Some of which will be forgiven \n\n\n\nNow that I have the numbers from all of these adjustments I can easily survive for a year until things recover. \n\n\nThe point is I keep reading everyone going on and on about how they can\u2019t understand why the market is going up and not falling apart. It is because everyone is doing the same analysis I am doing and they are realizing this is temporary And most companies aren\u2019t going to go under but will bounce back pretty quick. \n\nIm not saying everything is rosy and there isn\u2019t any risk of another leg down but overall consider the following \n\n- we are seeing the virus numbers flattening\n- an unprecedented amount of both monetary and fiscal stimulus \n- a healthy banking system backed by unlimited money printing \n- there will be pent up demand once people get over the fear of getting sick they are all going to book vacations, go out to events and spend money which will help employment bounce back quickly. \n\n\nWSB tends to not look much past the next week or months options expiration which I understand but the real money is buying this market because they can see that in 6 or 12 or 18 months we will be past this and the market will be higher than it is today. \n\nTLDR buy stocks or leaps on the most beat up sectors.
