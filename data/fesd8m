As of this Friday that position has reduced itself down into $60k most of which has been repair more than stop loss.\n\nSo First... **I'm an AUTISTIC D@#%@#\\*T.**   \n\n**Rule 1:** of earnings is you take 1/2 off of the table every single time you gain more than 100%.  \n\nThis is a never break rule... And I broke it.    Yes, I've had some extremely stupid plays...  Yes Robinhood was down on Monday...  None of this forgives me of breaking the number one rule which is **PAY YOURSELF.**\n\nThis isn't my first or last trip into the market... I'm staying and this post is me admitting very publicly that I broke the rules and earned the loss.  No, I'm not going to pursue Robinhood for my idiotic moves.  Last Friday at one point I had cashed out $221,000 in PUTS and sat for all of 3 minutes before putting myself into positions that the Karma Sutra would blush upon as ambitiously naive.  This was me trying to replicate historic wins... SO INCREDIBLY STUPID.   \n\n**Rule 2:**  Historical Trends are not necessarily an indicator of current conditions.  \n\nIn the past I prevented such autistic losses with automatic stop losses... I forgot that net as well... and paid.  This is now baked into every trade I have.   **And here begins the healing.**\n\nHaving now recollected on my two weeks of frantic insanity (While recovering from a cold the last three days that I hope is not COVID19) I'm looking at the long game of what's happening and I've been doing some thinking into the next big plays while watching other successful autists on this board make brilliant recommendations amongst some of the horrific chaff (Including myself in that comment).\n\nHere are some facts that I'm putting into consideration with my plays over the next 6 months. (AND THIS IS WSB not INVESTING)  So expect some absolute knife jackings to come into play.\n\n**1) Supply chains are broken** \\- Meaning goods we normally would purchase simply won't be there.  This is going to hurt any company relying on global supplies including pharmaceutical companies, car manufacturers, clothing manufacturers, cosmetics, alcohol distributors, and consumer goods.  While I could bear down a crap ton of these players... Let's be a bull for a second.  In about 4 weeks when these companies get desperate for shipments they have two people to turn to that we care about for options trading - **UPS** and FedEX **FDX.**   (April 30th UPS earnings and March 17th FedEx earnings).  Barring strange events UPS is going to get a notable lift from emergency deliveries where FedEx won't show that lift until 2nd half 2020.   UPS and FedEx can fricking charge whatever they feel like as long as it's cheaper than Delta **DAL**.  UPS ought to provide a nice surprise bump in their earnings report and I'd recommend calls on mid Wednesday this week starts to look like last week.  Delta isn't going to makeup enough on shipped goods to makeup for ticket sale losses. \\*Note - I expect all of the airlines to get a bailout package.\n\n**2) The Fed is using all of it's power to prevent a recession.** \\- This is one of their key jobs and should be no surprise to any Bears out there or bulls for that matter.  What's different this time is that it appears the Fed is employing some strong level AI in the preventative measures.  I have no evidence of this, just an awareness that any corrections are being reigned in extremely quickly.  I'm treating this as the new norm and **leaving cash on the side** for any further \"GUIDING\" like what we've seen each Friday and Monday morning.\n\n**3) Corona is real -** Please take an hour of your time and head over to the Coronavirus page on Reddit. This isn't Trump flu or Ebola... it's the first pandemic ever faced by a global economy with real time awareness.  There are going to be some extremely overpanicked plays out there and frankly WSBGod has an excellent basket of PUTS that are worth duplicating if you can on the dips.  Some plays I haven't seen deeply talked about include Starbucks **SBUX** (April 28th) and Dunkin Donuts **DNKN** (May 7th).  These two can't make up in drive through sales what in person foot traffic has driven.  They are going to be slaughtered along with any other corporation that requires social interactions or groupings to make money.\n\n**4) Corporate Earnings reports will match the facts even if the Fed props up the market.** \\- Never has it been more important to consider how earnings reports will be impacted by events.  This is a once in a lifetime chance to pick companies vulnerable to supply chain issues and social requirements and kill them with puts.  I'm personally knifing Mickey Mouse **DIS** as hard as possible with $100 strike Puts May 15th following their May 5th earnings report.  Disney has hotels, cruise ships, theme parks and movies that are all going to get mauled.  Further, movie schedules are going to get pushed out from fears by the actors, crews, and studios.   In short, the Fed can hide how bad things are regardless of the number of Covid 19 deaths right up until the first week of earnings where companies have been impacted.  I'm thinking the second week in April is where the shit hits the fan.  If things get worse on Corona I may take that into the first week of April.   This is where the bears should be ready to maul the market.  April 17th 290 and 285 SPY puts look great... once volatility drops to something realistic.  Look to May 15th if you're happier to play it safe. \n\n**5) The Long Game -** There is nothing wrong with buying leaps for short term trades.  I got back into the game when Tesla **TSLA** dropped to $225 and insisted that some of my key contacts buy leaps for 2021 and 2021 as the price was retardedly low.  It was in fact retardedly low enough to make me come back to the market as least in an advisory position until I saw my recommendations making 300% \\*LE SIGH.  That type of a win gets you out of retirement.\n\nThe same was true for Virgin Galatic... leaps for 2021 and 2022 purchased in December looked tasty.   The thing about leaps as opposed to short term puts and calls is that they give the false reassurance of value.  Think of leaps as calls/puts wrapped up in a Tiffany box with a 1 year warranty or for you degenerates... Leaps are Calls / Puts in lingerie.   You know the package is irrelevant to you... but people just can't resist the joy of unwrapping.   So buy them a g-string teddy or corset with riding crop action leap action.  \n\nSo... yep... I was an idiot... Yep I blew up a $325,000 position to $60k.  Never again... I'm following my rules, looking at the once in a lifetime opportunity of a pandemic, and I'm going to shiv a cutural icon until it squeaks like Snow White.  \"I do intend to provide aftercare and calls following the knifing\" \n\nGood luck and good night you Autists... Thanks for being in the game... You've made it fun for me again.", "created_utc": 1583569356, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fesd8m/yolo_losses_storytime_and_due_dilligence_from_a/", "is_self": true}
