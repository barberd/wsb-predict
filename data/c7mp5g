{"id": "c7mp5g", "title": "Charter Communications DD", "selftext": "**Purpose and Offerings**\n\tThe purpose of this analysis is to evaluate Charter Communications (henceforth referred to as Charter), its creditworthiness as an obligor, and which, if any, of its debt offerings is most desirable to hold as part of a bond portfolio. Charter, in May 2016, acquired both Time Warner Cable and Bright House to form one, unified company. In the newly unified entity, the operations of Charter, Time Warner Cable, and Bright House prior to the acquisitions (henceforth referred to as Legacy Charter, Time Warner Cable, and Legacy Bright House, respectively), are organized as subsidiaries of the overarching brand, Spectrum. In addition to these subsidiaries, there are a number of holding companies in Charter\u2019s corporate structure, which is pictured in Figure 1. All names used in Figure 1 are the names that will be used to describe the various subsidiaries in this analysis.\n\tCharter assumed all of the liabilities associated with the debt issuances of the Legacy companies through their acquisitions. As such, Charter has many outstanding debt issuances with varying maturities, covenants, and interest rates associated with them, all of which are enumerated in Figure 2. CCO Holdings has senior notes with maturities ranging from 2021 through 2028; Charter Operating has senior notes due from 2020 to 2055; TWC has senior notes with maturities from 2018 to 2031 and senior debentures due 2037 through 2042; TWCE has senior debentures with maturities ranging from 2023 through 2033. In total, the accreted value of all of Charter\u2019s debt obligations is in excess of $70 billion, which the company recognizes as problematic for a number of reasons, which are discussed in the Financial Condition subsection of this analysis. This analysis will focus primarily on Charter\u2019s debt issuances that are secured and that have shorter investment horizons due to the uncertainty and risks associated with the firm\u2019s positioning within the cable TV and Internet service industries, the longer-run industry trends, and the firm\u2019s financial condition.\n\n\n**Industry Evaluation**\n\tCharter, which, following its acquisition of Time Warner Cable and Bright House, is now the second largest cable company in the United States, services 27.2 million customers through its various residential and commercial business segmentsi. Of the company\u2019s variety of offerings, which includes video, Internet, voice, enterprise solutions, and other services, the firm\u2019s primary channels of revenue are through its residential video and Internet services, which, combined, contributed over 74% of the firm\u2019s revenue in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018ii. While the company\u2019s commercial services are important, this analysis focuses on the residential part of Charter\u2019s operations due to the disproportionate amount of revenue that is generated therein.\n\tThe traditional competitors to Charter in its cable video offerings include other cable operators such as Comcast and Verizon as well as satellite television providers, including AT&amp;T and Dish Network. Charter, itself, following its acquisitions in 2016, identified its own peer group as containing: Comcast, Verizon, AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, Spring, Time Warner Inc., Viacom, Dish Network Corporation, CenturyLink, and a few other, less notable and/or comparable companiesiii. In both the cable video and Internet industries, Charter competes as a cost-leader, whereas other companies, such as Verizon, compete on quality and differentiation.\n\tThe cable provider industry sells access to video content generally on a subscription basis, frequently bundling video services with other, related services including Internet and voice: 59% of Charter\u2019s customers subscribe to a bundled package of the company\u2019s servicesiv. In this industry, companies price their packages based on the amount of content or data the customers subscribe for. While driving up the amount of revenue per customer, through additional service bundling or up-selling Internet or video content tiers, is important to revenue growth in the industry, perhaps the most critical external driver of this industry is the number of cable TV subscribers. As indicated by Figure 3, the pay TV industry, which includes both cable and satellite television services, has witnessed a substantial dip in subscribers in recent years, with a nearly 1.5 million net customer loss in 2017v. This trend of \u201ccord-cutters\u201d is being driven by changes in demographics of the U.S. population with different consumption preferences and by substitute products from new market entrants. This problem can also be seen in Figure 4, which shows how Pay-TV penetration has fallen from 88% to 79% since 2010, which threatens industry profitability.\nOne worrying trend for cable providers is that younger consumers, who will drive revenue over the coming years, do not subscribe to paid television services at the same rate as older consumers: 65% of consumers from 18 to 29 years old subscribe which pales in comparison to the 83.0% of consumers over 50 years old that subscribevi. While this may be, in part, due to the relative levels of disposable income between these two customer segments, it very well could be attributable to the other, perhaps more threatening, trend of new market entrants taking away market share. In recent years, technological innovations have led to a booming growth in online streaming services. Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, Youtube, and other streaming services threaten to capture market share from incumbents in the subscription TV industry. These streaming alternatives not only offer packages that are more finely tailored to the desires of the individual customer, but they are substantially cheaper than cable TV packages. At $35 per month, YoutubeTV significantly undercuts Charter, which tries to act as a cost leadervii. This trend of lower-cost alternatives entering the market is more problematic for Charter, as a cost leader, than for firms that offer a differentiated product. If Charter\u2019s only selling-point is its lower cost relative to the industry, they have no competitive advantage if they are undercut.\nAnother trend within the industry is the increasing price of content that production firms chargeviii. Which content a cable provider offers is extremely important to how well they are able to attract new customers and reduce the churn of their existing client base. As shown in Figure 5, 21% of consumers report having signed up for a streaming service for access to a specific show. This number is even higher for younger consumers, who will become an increasingly important source of revenue for the coming years. If Charter is able to produce high quality, original content, the firm may be able to entice new customers to sign up for its services. The trend of increasing prices for content, however, is a concern for Charter. As a low cost provider, the company is only able to pass on the increasing price of content so much before consumers will move elsewhere with their money.\n\n\n**Governance &amp; Management Assessment**\n\tCharter Communications has a talented and well-regarded management team with decades of experience in the cable industry. The company is headed by Thomas Rutledge, appointed President and CEO in 2012 and Chairman of the Board in 2016, whose work at American Television and Communications, starting in 1977, was the beginning of his career in the cable industryix. He previously served as COO of Cablevision, President of Time Warner Cable, and now is a board member of a number of important entities in the cable industryx. Rutledge has been honored with, among other awards, the NCTA\u2019s Vanguard award for Distinguished Leadership and an induction into the Cable Hall of Famexi. \nJohn Bickham, appointed COO in 2012 and President in 2016, also has an extensive r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of work within the cable industry, having served as President of Cable and Communications for Cablevision, Executive Vice President for Time Warner Cable, and having helped found KBLCOM in addition to serving as its President and COOxii.\nThe current CFO of Charter Communications is Christopher Winfrey, who has held the title since 2010. Prior to joining the company, Winfrey worked in a CFO and Managing Director capacity for Unitymedia GmbH and as Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance and Development at Cablecomxiii. \nAll three of these officers of the company have significant experience that portend shrewd management for years to come. They have experience in the cable industry that should help guide them to adapt to the trends in the market. There is the potential, however, for management to be too entrenched in its current mode of operation and to not successfully adapt to the rapidly changing cable industry. While Charter\u2019s management has experience, the industry has gone through a tremendous shift in recent years and new technological innovations and new market entrants threaten profitability. If Charter\u2019s management are not willing or able to adapt to these market trends, the company could be poorly positioned for the future.\n\tManagement\u2019s goals are aligned with the company\u2019s stakeholders\u2019 through a lucrative stock compensation program that was implemented in 2009. Under this program, \u00ad\u00addirectors, officers, and other employees are vested stock options and/or restricted stock units based on stock performancexiv. Unrecognized compensation in the form of stock options and restricted stock units are $211,000,000 and $173,000,000 as of December 31, 2017. By linking compensation to company performance, Charter Communications has reduced its principal-agent problem and has helped push management to leverage its significant experience for the good of the company\u2019s stakeholders. Rutledge, Bickham, and Winfrey have made great use of this stock compensation program, each earning $98,515,727, $47,441,038, and $20,098,264, respectively, in 2016xv.\n\n\n**Covenants**\n\tAs previously noted, Charter has many debt issuances under its numerous subsidiaries and holding companies, all with varying rates, maturity dates, covenants, and collateral. The senior notes issued by CCO Holdings and CCO Holdings Capital, which total to $18.9 billion in principal, are unsecured and are subordinated to the secured obligations of their subsidiariesxvi. 40% of the principal of these notes are callable from 2018 through 2020 and 100% are callable from 2019 through 2025xvii. The covenants of these unsecured notes issued by CCO Holdings and CCO Holdings Capital appear in Figure 6. Despite being unsecured and subordinated debt, the covenants of these debt offerings affect CCO Holdings and its subsidiaries. Among the most notable of these covenants are restrictive covenants that limit the firm\u2019s ability to incur additional debt and pay dividends, but these are dependent upon the firm\u2019s leverage ratio. \nAll of the other debt offerings issued by Charter and its subsidiaries are secured and it is these that will be analyzed more fully. Additionally, the debt issuances that are considered herein have maturities in the near term, due to risk factors detailed more fully in the Financial Condition and External Information subsections of this analysis. In November 2016, Charter Operating and CCO Capital issued senior secured notes due 2020, 2022, 2025, 2035, 2045, and 2055, which can be reviewed in Figure 2.  These newly issued notes are \u201cpari passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior indebtedness of the Issuers\u201d and are \u201csecured by liens on the Collateral on an equal and ratable basis with the obligations\u201d of the other subsidiaries and holding companies and can be called any time prior to their respective maturity datesxviii. These debt issues have a number of covenants that restrict certain subsidiaries of Charter from granting liens or selling all assets/merging into other companiesxix. In addition to being unsecured, CCO Holdings\u2019 debt is less attractive because of its covenants. Charter Operating does not have a cross default covenant, while CCO Holdings\u2019 does. This means that if the company defaults on some other debt issuance, CCO Holdings will necessarily default on its issuance, while Charter Operating will not.\n\n\n**Financial Condition**\n\tOn December 31, 2017, Charter\u2019s debt ratio was 46.50% and its net debt to EBITDA ratio was 4.53. These ratios reveal that a high percentage of the company\u2019s operations are financed through debt and the company\u2019s ability to pay off its debt through operations. Charter recognizes that it \u201c[has] a significant amount of debt and may incur significant additional debt, including secured debt, in the future, which could adversely affect [the company\u2019s] financial health and [its] ability to react to changes in [its] business\u201dxx. Among the most important implications of the company\u2019s debt are the fact that the interest and principal payments detract, in a significant way, from the firm\u2019s funds available for capital expenditures and changes in the business. This is especially critical for Charter given the industry trends of technological innovation, increasing content costs, and the high capital intensity of the broadband industry. The industries in which Charter competes will require the firm to make significant investments to even retain its current customer base, so the firm\u2019s significant interest and principal payments threaten to undermine its ability to compete. The dire nature of the firm\u2019s current position can be seen by its EBIT-to-interest coverage ratio, which is 1.33 for 2017. This means that the firm only generated enough earnings through operations to pay off its interest obligations 1.33 times. This ratio is dangerously close to 1.0, below which the firm would be unable to pay off its interest payments purely through income from operations. \n\n\n**External Information**\n\tCharter\u2019s corporate credit rating is BB+/Ba2/BB+ (Fitch/Moody\u2019s/S&amp;P). The credit rating assigned to each series of notes are aligned with the subsidiary of Charter that they were issued by. The unsecured senior notes issued by CCO Holdings are all rated BB+/B1/BB (below investment grade). For all of the other notes issued by Charter\u2019s subsidiaries (by Charter Operating, TWC, and TWCE), the ratings are BBB-/Ba1/BBB- (investment grade). The disparity between the ratings for issuances from different subsidiaries seems to reflect the fact that CCO Holdings\u2019 issuances are not secured and the fact that they are exposed to other risks.\n\tEquity investors seemingly have confidence in the company\u2019s ability to adapt to industry trends and succeed into the future. The company\u2019s stock price has increased from around $200 to over $315 over the past three years. The company is substantially below its 52-week high of $408.83, but the growth over the past three years in the price still reveals confidence.\n\n\n**Recommendation**\n\tWhile Charter and its subsidiaries\u2019 debt issuances are widely held and fairly liquid for high-yield bonds, a strategy of holding bonds with a longer term to maturity, even with the intention of divesting before maturity, is not attractive given the current state of the economy. The current increasing rate environment, with the Federal Reserve set for multiple rate hikes of the federal funds rate in 2018xxi, makes longer-term debt less attractive because of its increased sensitivity of price to interest rate fluctuations. The significant interest rate risk of the longer-term debt issuances makes them less attractive to their shorter-term alternatives.\n\tOutside of interest rate risk, all of Charter\u2019s debt issuances have call provisions, meaning that they are subject to call risk. As a result of the call provisions, investors face reinvestment risk. If the firm calls the bonds early, after interest rates have fallen and the firm is able to refinance at a lower rate, investors will be hard-pressed to find similarly risky investments with a similar level of return. Additionally, the call provision in these debt offerings reduces the capital appreciation potential of the company\u2019s bonds because the company will call the bond if the value appreciates too much, as a response to lower interest rates.\n\tWhile Charter debt is widely held in high-yield bond portfolios, it is still a below investment grade bond with substantial liquidity risk. While investments in the shorter-term notes may not pose a problem for investors in this way, being that they can be held until maturity without much threat of needing to sell them quickly, investors in the notes that mature later, such as the series that matures in 2055, should pay attention to liquidity risk because holding a note for this length of time is a substantial commitment and if the investor must convert their position to cash, they might lose a significant amount of value on the transaction.\n\tFor pound sterling-denominated notes issued by Charter, there exists exchange-rate risk, which is not present in dollar-denominated notes. While it is possible to hedge currency risk through futures contracts, there is a cost to this hedging strategy that does not exist for dollar-denominated contracts and, consequently, these are less attractive.\n\tGiven the substantial debt position of Charter and how near it is to being unable to finance its interest payments through its operations, the company\u2019s bonds are unlikely to be upgraded. This problem is likely to persist due to the fact that Charter is financing its old debt payments by issuing new debt, it is evident that Charter has not found a way to rectify this issue. In fact, due to rising costs of content and its consequent diminishing margins, this problem might become exacerbated and lead to a downgrade. \n\tIn sum, due to the substantial uncertainty surrounding the firm\u2019s ability to effectively adapt to market trends and the significant interest rate risk posed by the current rising rates environment, the longer-term notes are less attractive than the shorter-term notes. Additionally, CCO Holdings\u2019 notes are less attractive than the offerings by Charter\u2019s other subsidiaries because they are unsecured and they have a cross-default provision. If an investor desired to include Charter in a bond portfolio, shorter-term, secured notes would be the best option due to the fact that they are not quite as exposed to the operational, interest rate, credit downgrade, and cross-default risks that longer-term notes are. However, the best option for a bond investor is to not include Charter in his portfolio because of tremendous uncertainty surrounding how Charter will adapt to the trends of its industries, how it will position itself given that it is no longer the lowest cost producer, and how unclear Charter\u2019s plan is to deal with its significant interest and principal payment obligations.", "created_utc": 1561946606, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c7mp5g/charter_communications_dd/", "is_self": true}
