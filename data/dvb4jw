Banks typically charge for ACH transfers, so you'll already be in the red \u2013 well, **deeper** in the red for most of you \u2013 by the time you get to ToS.   \n\n\u2022 That said, ToS has a much better UX: faster fills, actual customer support, etc. For real-time quotes, you'll need to answer another one of their questionnaires indicating you're not a professional trader or some shit like that: for some reason, they lovvvveeee questionnaires.   \n\n\u2022 There's probably some other shit, but my ADHD is soaring so if there was, I forgot it.", "created_utc": 1573570934, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dvb4jw/things_to_know_before_you_dump_robinhood/", "is_self": true}
