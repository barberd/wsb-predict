{"id": "d5hn5y", "title": "How did you play oil yesterday?", "selftext": "I sold calls at the $28 strike on UCO (2x leveraged oil ETF) expiring this Friday for an average of $30 a contract. On top of that, I purchased a few call options on SCO (3x leveraged inverse oil ETF) for October. Both are in the green today. Liquidity has dried up on the $28 UCO strike and I'll probably be forced to hold until they expire.\n\nI ran into some margin/capital requirement problems too and had to liquidate a few contracts, which sucks.\n\nDid anyone mess around with WLL or leveraged oil ETFs?
