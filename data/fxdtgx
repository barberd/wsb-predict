{"id": "fxdtgx", "title": "The Games might Stop - GameStop Debt Breakdown.", "selftext": "Hello,\n\nNow it's my turn to try this. Everything you will read below our lord fuzzy has taught me is these last couple of weeks. Thank you!\n\nSpoiler: I am not that good at this, so do your own research. Even if I would give advice I wouldn't touch it. I don't get payed doing this.\n\nTL;DR: This is already one from the 10-K so be happy. It could be 100 pages.\n\nNow let's begin!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1. The Business**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou all know what GameStop does so I will skip the description.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs of Feb 1 2020 they had 5509 locations across 14 countries. Spread out in these locations: United States (3,642), Canada (299), Australia (426) and Europe (1,142).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"All of our retail stores are located in leased premises.\" These lease contract will cost GameStop $800m for the coming years. 2020 alone they will have to pay $268m in leases. That is already quite a lot of money even when the buisness is open.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"In response to the outbreak of COVID-19, we have temporarily closed stores on a country-wide basis in Europe, primarily in Italy and France, as well as in Canada, which became effective in various points in March 2020.In the United States, effective March 22, 2020, we have temporarily closed all storefronts to customers but continue to process orders on a digital only basis, offering curbside pick-up at stores and e-commerce delivery only.As a result of these actions, we expect a significant reduction in customer traffic and demand, which will adversely impact our ability to generate cash from our operating activities. We cannot reasonably estimate the amount of this negative impact.\"\n\nWe can all agree on that it will be a big impact.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey have approximately 14,000 full-time salaried and hourly employees and between 22,000 and 42,000 part-time hourly employees worldwide. As of Feb 2020.  As of now no real number on how many have been layed off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBreakdown on their numbers:\n\nNet Sales of 6,4B\n\n\\- Hardware & Accessories      - $2,7b\n\n\\- Sofware \t\t                     - $3,0b\n\n\\- Collectibles \t                     -$ 737m\n\nDown 20% since last year\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey -$0.5b in profits. At least they lost less than last year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTheir EBITDA - the most important indicator.\n\nThey don't even disclose in the 10-K. Such a shame.\n\nI found it on macrotrends... for 2019 it was -$303m\n\nEdit: Thanks to u/painpita he helped calculate it.\n\nSee below:\n\nFY 2019 it was -->\n\nOperating earnings --> -$400M\n\n\\+ Asset impairment $21,7M\n\n\\+ Goodwill impairment $363.9M\n\nFor a grand total of drumroll -$15M\n\n*Other method*\n\nGross profit - SG&A, obviously same result.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey have been slashing their dividends for years and now don't even pay a dividend anymore. From $150m >$ 40m > $0 in dividends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n$27m in interest payments. Which decreased drastically (46%) becasue they paid off $350m in senior notes begining 2019.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey nowhave around $500m in cash. Beginning of the period they had 1.6b.\n\nConsidering their leases for 2020 is already 50% of their cash on hand. It's not a good sign.\n\nTheir operating cost is: $2,350b. They will be fine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe stock prices peaked in 2008. Almost got back to ATH in 2014. Tried once more in end of 2015 has have since then been declining from $47 to $3.5 where it stands today.\n\nNot much more to say than, i'm sorry for the bagholders.\n\nWhich two of are Hestia Capital Partners LP & Permit Capital Enterprise Fund. They together own 7,5% of the outstanding common stock. On the 3rd of april 2020 they filed a preliminary proxy statement stating that they have lost faith in the current board and believe they have let the shareholders down.\n\nThe funds want to remove the board and replace it with a new one to get GameStop back to where their once were.

I will give it a shot.\n\nLucky for me they don't seem to have a very complicated debt structure. No bonds.\n\nJust simple Senior Notes and a Revolver(for the easy way out).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn 2016 they issued $475m in senior notes with a principle of 6,75%. This is due in march 2021. In 2018 the bought back 53m bringing the senior notes to $419m at fair value as of feb 1 2020.\n\nIn april 2019 they redeemed their $350m which they had in senior notes with cash on hand which was due to october 2019.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"We maintain an asset-based revolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolver\u201d) with a borrowing base capacity of $420 million and a maturity date of November 2022.\"\n\nAs of Feb 1 they had $270m left to use. The Revolver has a $200m expansion feature and $50m letter of credit sublimit, and allows for an incremental 450m first-in, last-out facility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuring Q1 this year they already took out an additional $150m from their expansion feature.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3. The Next Chapter - The Future**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo now the part you all have been waiting for. What to do with this information. I will give you advice on what positions to get. So here it comes: \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*.\n\nHonestly, I thought they were going to be more fucked than this. I'm not smart enough to tell you what this all means. But they seem to be able to get past COVID-19.\n\nThey will need more cash. So how much more can they get?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey have a line of credit with a subsidiary in Lux with BAC. Totaling $20m\n\nI think they can get an additional $30m from the Ratio Basket.\n\nCouldn't seem to find anything about the General Baseket nor how much more they are able to issue in new senior notes. The result of these questions will most likely determine the future of GameStop.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo Poison Pill or PIPE deals as of yet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyone with more valid information I will gladly accept.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis was a fun exercise. I recommend everyone to try.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I fucked up the formatting didn't I?", "created_utc": 1586376620.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxdtgx/the_games_might_stop_gamestop_debt_breakdown/", "is_self": true}
