Time to buy them SPY puts boys", "selftext": "Hello fellow autists, it's ya boi Tatar here with some boring TA for you to think about. Since understanding simple charts requires an IQ of at least 80, I estimate that 90% of you will have no idea what I'm talking about and just skip to the bottom to copy my position. Lucky for you that I am not so greedy that I don't care about you as well, just look at the fancy chart and let that justify your decision to throw your life savings into more SPY puts. Additional DD is optional. It's better that way.\n\nI've been waiting for today for about a month now, and it is a glorious day indeed. Here is the chart in question: (don't worry, I will explain all the fancy lines and circles to you. Wouldn't want you to have an aneurysm)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/joo46x355my41.png?width=1560&format=png&auto=webp&s=b53774da10f5a7ec64825731b4d8447298503692\n\nThe red and green blocks: volume, retard\n\nThe fancy orange line: 21 day moving average for volume\n\nThe confusing white line: 21 day VWMA. I know acronyms are hard, that's okay. Ask your wifes boyfriend for help if you're confused.\n\nFebruary 24th and April 6th are the dates in question. Had you then followed what I'm about to tell you then, you'd be swimming in tendies and hunny mussy.\n\nBasically, the VWMA line serves as a line of support and resistance. When the price action breaks that barrier, WITH VOLUME, it is a strong indicator of a reversal. I use the 21 day MA for volume as a good indicator to let me see where volume is at at any given time. As you see, on Feb 24th the price action crossed the VWMA with volume and continued until we reached our March 23rd bottom. Two times the price action tested VWMA, but did not have enough bullish buyers to continue. This brings us to the enigma of April 6th...\n\nIt doesn't take a rocket surgeon to see that the crossover on April 6th was met with lower volume numbers. This is not an indication of a trend reversal but is a warning sign of instability. If you were one of those that thought JPow cancelled the recession, you simply didn't do your DD and are just throwing 50 on black.  To be honest, I am surprised the rally lasted as long as it did on continually decreasing volume numbers. As price continued to trend up, volume continued to go lower, staying consistently under the 21MA. UNTIL TODAY\n\nSo, why is today significant? Not only did the price action cross over the VWMA, but it did so while volume crossed over the 21MA. Increased volume + VWMA crossover = high probability of trend reversal.\n\nSo, what does this mean for you? Well, depending on your risk tolerance, you can play this one of three ways:\n\n* Big Dick Risk: Spy puts at open tomorrow\n* Good Enough Dick Risk: Wait to confirm one more bar of increased volume met with decreased price, then Spy puts EOD tomorrow\n* Vaginal risk: Sell everything at open and buy the dip\n\nPosition: SPY 255p 9/30, WW 25p 10/16, NAT 5c 6/19 (tanker gang unite \u270a)", "created_utc": 1589411372.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gja4qo/calling_all_s_our_time_has_come_time_to_buy_them/", "is_self": true}
