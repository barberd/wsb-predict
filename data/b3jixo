I had lines everywhere.  Where resistance was what trends were.   I had the daily chart and the 5 min chart marked up to high hell.  As most know around that time AAPL was up about 40 cents over yesterday's close and considering it had been down all session I was satisfied with that.  I have a short vertical spread on AAPL.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway I have this diagonal line on my 5 min chart that I am dicking with for like 15 minutes trying to figure out how I drew it.  I have no idea what trend it was and if it came from the daily or the 5 min.  It literally on both charts appeared to be random.  When I flipped back to the daily it seemed that all my diagonal lines matched a trend, but I could not correlate it to the 5 min chart at all.  Here's the kicker at 1 pm the stock crossed this diagonal line.  The stock went to the moon at that point.  Nearly a full $1 in one minute.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo here I sit with two problems:\n\n1.  If I could figure out what the heck I drew that line on I'd be a trading rock-star.\n2. If I could screen for whatever that line is I'd be raking it in", "created_utc": 1553126620, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b3jixo/my_unidentifiable_mad_skillz/", "is_self": true}
