{"id": "gmfl7s", "title": "Repeated covered calls to rack up shares", "selftext": "This shit is crazy. I want to use VBIV as an example. It's share price is $2.19, so let's say we have $2190 for 1000 shares. Then we can sell 10 VBIV $2.50c 1/15/21 for $1.20 each, netting $1200. Then we can buy 500 shares for $1095, selling 5 more calls for $600 total - meaning you now have 1500 shares, 15 covered calls, and $705. We can do it a few more times - buy 300 shares for $657 and sell 3 calls for $360, a net of $408. We can buy another 100 shares for $219 and then sell a covered call for $120, ending up at $309. Do it AGAIN, end with $309 - $219 + $120 = $210, so we finally can't repeat it.\n\nWorking through all that bullshit gives us  2000 shares of VBIV (value = $4380), -20 calls at $2.50 1/15/21, and $210 leftover. If you do this for high IV options (say ER run-up but you also believe in the company doing well), then you can buy back those calls at a very reduced price and end up with double what you wouldve had if you had bought shares outright in the beginning.\n\nAlright, why am I stupid?", "created_utc": 1589854257.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gmfl7s/repeated_covered_calls_to_rack_up_shares/", "is_self": true}
