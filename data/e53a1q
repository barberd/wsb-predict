{"id": "e53a1q", "title": "TVIX correlation to VIX", "selftext": "So I\u2019m long tvix since Friday. Been noticing that tvix has lost correlation with the vix. There have been days where vix would be up 5% and tvix (which is supposed to be leveraged) would only be up 3% or something I attributed it simply to decay. (Contango or whatever) \n\nToday vix spiked 12%, tvix is only up 6.8%. Not sure what to make of it, this is a prolonged uncorrelation between tvix and vix, for probably the past week or week and a half. I know tvix is an etn so this is possible, but what should I make of it?\n\nDoes it mean traders aren\u2019t buying spy vix futures? And why the fuck not, given we\u2019re up more than 20% ytd?", "created_utc": 1575311723, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e53a1q/tvix_correlation_to_vix/", "is_self": true}
