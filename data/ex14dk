I immediately bought and held AIMT shares as soon as I possibly could, just waiting to buy a covered call.  \nHowever, in this same mindset, I had to read whatever data was available to make the most informed decision. None of you know me form a fucking hole in the wall, but I do auditing and data management in clinical research. Clintrials are fucky, and even when something gets to the point of approval, you do your due diligence.  \n\n\nPalforzia is a great bandaid, but not for everyone, and with this treatment being geared toward motherfucking kids, I think it's really important to be sure about what you're doing. 14% of the participants in the clintrials (52 people) still had to be injected with epinephrine. Epi pen injections fucking suck, and for kids, it's scary and traumatizing and dangerous.  \n\n\nIf you're super interested on making a wicked long call on a peanut allergy drug, DBVT is rolling out a patch in August that does the same thing, but so far, no epinephrine has been needed.\n\n[Here are some numbers, I can no longer find the direct link to what was published from the study.](https://endpts.com/no-surprises-in-fda-staff-review-for-aimmune-peanut-allergy-therapy-focus-remains-on-safety-tolerability-profile/)\n\n  \nHere's the TL;DR: Palforzia could be shutdown in a snap depending on how aggressively the treatment is rolled out. 14% isn't a shitshow in trials, but that was a limited group.", "created_utc": 1580533052, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ex14dk/aimt_is_looking_really_good_but_please_be_fucking/", "is_self": true}
