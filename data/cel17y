{"id": "cel17y", "title": "Help Me Understand NFLX", "selftext": "How can they have positive earnings but incredibly negative FCF?  It looks like their spending on content is completely independent of \"cost of goods sold\", essentially as investment rather than an ongoing expense.\n\nMy understanding of stocks is heavily rooted in automobiles and semiconductors.  There, R&amp;D is a huge expense, for semiconductors moreso than autos.  Intel, AMD, Qualcomm and Nvidia all subtract their absolutely massive R&amp;D expenditures from their equally massive gross margins (AMD's margins were unsustainable bad at less than 40%, Intel is doing well at better than 50%), but their earnings are nowhere near that high because the EPS already has the R&amp;D subtracted out.\n\nSemiconductor companies cannot survive on their back catalogs, and massive R&amp;D spending is an ongoing necessity.  While it is not a cost of sales line item, it comes out of revenue before earnings.  Similarly, NFLX cannot survive on its back catalog (i.e. binge watching Stranger Things 1-3...2027) at least not at anything like its present valuation.  That is even more true with competitors pulling third party content back onto their own, new streaming platforms while continuing to produce new, competitive content.\n\nFrom that end, I would argue that while there may be some justification for how NFLX calculates EPS, the way that they do it excludes a massive line item that they cannot reduce without tanking revenue.  Therefore, by their accounting standards, EPS is virtually meaningless while FCF is the only metric that matters.\n\nFrom that standpoint, NFLX seems less like a profitable company with international subscriber growth issues and domestic market saturation and more like a company that is literally hemorrhaging capital in a model that will never generate actual profits.\n\nMaybe I'm misunderstanding this badly, but that's the best I could do.
