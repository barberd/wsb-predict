Given the first few months, the price is almost guaranteed to swing AT LEAST +/- 30%... This gave me the idea...\n\nWhat if at the time of the IPO you put options going both ways long term.\n\nAssuming this overall trend (and some go +/- 100% or more given a few months), surely one of your options trade should be -100%... meaning the other option must've shot up at least like 500% or more!\n\nComment below your thoughts regarding if this is absolutely brilliant, or fucking stupid. \n\nThanks", "created_utc": 1568082738, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d21e2j/options_profit_idea/", "is_self": true}
