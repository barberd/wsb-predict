{"id": "dq67m8", "title": "FIT December 13th 7.5$ calls?", "selftext": "A lot of people made good money today off of fitbit calls, but people who were holding 7.5+ got IV crushed hard. The premium for the purchase of fitbit was smaller than people expected and it's now trading pretty significantly lower than what Google was even offering to pay. That being said, I feel like the chance of short term return back to 7.30-7.35 range seems pretty probable considering upcoming earnings, potential fda approval of new tech, etc, and in that case the December 13th 7.5 calls are a steal. They're selling for 5$ a contract right now which is remarkably cheap and any move back towards 7.30 range would easily push them to 10$ or more which would be a great ROI. Also, in my opinion, the premium Google is offering is small enough that there is a chance a company like Amazon might throw out there own bid considering the fact that Alexa is already in Fitbit and they could really use the tech as well. So in that case theres a small chance that a new bid would push fitbit over 7.75, and the 7.5 calls would become extremely profitable. Either way though, it seems like those calls are selling ridiculously cheap now, especially considering the proximity to strike and length until expiration", "created_utc": 1572624085, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dq67m8/fit_december_13th_75_calls/", "is_self": true}
