{"id": "fp1z6y", "title": "2 million unemployment claims filed last week", "selftext": "EDIT2: THIS IS PROBABLY AN ESTIMATED FIGURE, NOT THE ACTUAL NUMBER! See 09:20:34 PM speech by Senator Wyden where he says \"when you see the unemployment claim numbers tomorrow (if the numbers are accurate)...\". I don't think they have the numbers either. Just working with estimates.\n\n[DD] They're debating the extra $600 per week in unemployment benefits and Senator Durbin says 2 million unemployment claims filed in last week (compared to previous week's 280k claims).\n\nhttps://www.c-span.org/congress/?chamber=senate He says it at 8:21pm\n\nEDIT: Expected number is 1mil to 4mil depending on who you ask (https://www.pymnts.com/coronavirus/2020/unemployment-expected-highest-ever-jobs-report/).\n\nEDIT3: From a commenter below:\n> Hey guys, I compiled an updated Google Sheets page with all of the current unemployment claims by state that I could find. It's an open-edit link so anybody can contribute if you have more data/sources\n\n> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12QBxigFgOfDHLbc9SB7W6le6ICHONBG-7AwAe9hXEko/edit?usp=sharing\n\n> Current number of unemployment claims (with sources) submitted throughout the U.S. is 5,797,000 and that is with data missing from15 states. Also, most of the data found was sourced from last week. It has been almost impossible to find anything current.\n\nUS economy fuked\n\nSPY 200P 4/20", "created_utc": 1585183566.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fp1z6y/2_million_unemployment_claims_filed_last_week/", "is_self": true}
