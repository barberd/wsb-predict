This is the same guy that voted no on the \u201cEmmitt Till Anti-Lynching Act\u201d, just to give you an idea of how much of a piece of shit this guy is.\n\nLittle does he know though is that now at least 216 members will all be together, with a few bound to pick up the Rona. Massie doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s helping us \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b in the long run.\n\n[NKY Rep.
