The 2 companies in working this idea with right now are I and ACB they cost 3.30 and 1.53 respectively at the time I'm writing this. The atm call for acb 1 week out sold for .16 assuming every week pays out similar that means the stock you bought is free after 10 weeks. And the only way it fails is the company greater than the premium of 10% each week for 10 weeks straight. No matter how shitty the company that seems unlikely to me.", "created_utc": 1581525513, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f2tx01/buying_shit_stock_for_the_sole_purpose_of_selling/", "is_self": true}
