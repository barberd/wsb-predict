Questrade is bad at joking, and it is against the policy of the employees to engage in jokes!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Robin J:** I have checked this for you and the options you are holding in the account are adjusted options and not the options which are are the reverse split.10:17:33 AM**Robin J:** The details are updated correctly on the platform and it is showing worthless as there is no bid for the adjusted option.10:17:40 AM**Robin J:** Please note that whenever a corporate action happens and you have purchased the option before a corporate action like reverse split then your option is not updated with the new details but the same option is adjusted based on the corporate action.10:17:48 AM**Robin J:** As the options are adjusted there can be a possibility that it is not trading as a new option with the reverse split will be already trading.10:17:49 AM**Robin J:** Such activities are not controlled by Questrade as it is company and exchange decision.10:18:16 AM**Robin J:** We update the details based on the information received from the company and the exchange.10:18:53 AM**Me:** so, do i hold until expiry and just hope for a fair bid as there is nothing i can do now? 10:19:23 AM**Robin J:** You can place a limit order and if there is a bid meeting your limit price then your order may get executed.10:20:42 AM**Me:** and if they are only trading the new options, then how is that legal that all i am holding is suddenly worthless??? 10:22:13 AM**Me:** If there is going to be no bids I cannot sell, even though they are holding more value than listed, and I'm out of all my principle and 20 k loaned that I should be able to sell for break even10:22:58 AM**Robin J:** I do understand that but you have the option before the corporate action happened. So when a corporate action happens and the expiry date is not passed you will still hold the option but the old option will be adjusted based on the corporate action.10:24:08 AM**Robin J:** This is applicable to the options whose expiration is nearby and far.10:24:33 AM**Me:** So, hold and hope that someone puts in bids by expiry, gain what few cents its worth if it crashes again.10:27:28 AM**Me:** Any good deals on ROPE? 10:27:42 AM**Robin J:** Could you please clarify your question a bit more for me?10:28:28 AM**Me:** ROPE. you buy rope after you lose everything you worked for in your whole life.10:28:55 AM**Robin J:** To assist you better can you please explain what you mean by ROPE. I am asking this as I am unable to understand what it is related to?10:30:15 AM**Me:** to hang myself10:31:29 AM**Robin J:** I definitely understand, however, you are feeling as such a loss will be unbearable. But when you trade an option it always has a risk associated with it. When you gain the profits are high and the losses are also high when such corporate action happens when it is not in your favor.10:33:40 AM**Me:** Yes, I understand. Thanks, any good information to share with the wife so she is not investigated for a homicide???10:34:35 AM**Robin J:** I am really sorry but I will not be able to comment on this. If you have any other questions related to your account please do let me know.10:36:03 AM**Me:** OK. Thank you. Glad to know Questrade is covered, and all lies in the hands of the coporations selling the ETFs to do as they please. 10:36:48 AM**Robin J:** Is there anything else that I could assist you with today?10:38:16 AM**Me:** No, I'll google how to tie the noose. Thanks! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately, they are not trained in counselling too.
