TL;DR: US banks are lending imaginary money called eurodollars to shady developing banks, and this shadow lending is causing a liquidity crisis\n\nBut that got me thinking about banks, specifically Goldman Sachs and BoA (we're focusing on Goldman today).\n\nPer their [2019 earnings report](https://www.goldmansachs.com/media-relations/press-releases/current/pdfs/2019-q4-results.pdf), **40%** of their net revenue is from global markets. Of the 40%, this global market is divided into FICCs (fixed interest rate, commodities, currency) and equities.\n\n**This 40% doesn't include the OTHER global exposure they have, which is under Investment Banking (21% earnings). GS offers both corporate lending and financial services such as underwriting, auditing, CIO/CFO for IPO offerings, M&As etc.** \n\nFor example, if Startup X wanted to be do an IPO in HKEX (Hong Kong Exchange), Goldman Sachs makes significant money off as an underwriter. [what an underwriter is](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwriter.asp) \n\nOn top of that, they have global exposure in Asset Management and Consumer & Wealth Management. First, Goldman Sachs was one of the bigger banks to establish themselves early in China in 1997. During which, China experienced a huge boom in middle class and also in millionaires -- [4.4millionaires as of 2019](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/21/china-overtakes-us-in-rankings-of-worlds-richest-people), and obviously Goldman wanted a slice of those management fees. \n\nTo give an idea, GS has [84 locations worldwide](https://www.goldmansachs.com/our-firm/locations.html), of these locations:\n\n* 8 of them are in China, centered around Beijing and HK/Shenzhen\n* 3 of them in Brazil\n* 11 of them are in EU/UK countries Italy, Spain, France, Germany etc with known lockdowns or Coronavirus cases\n\nThese locations are office locations and do not count the partnerships GS has with other companies for instance their joint venture with China-based securities and brokerage firm Gao Hua (15% stake) etc.\n\n**Therefore, repo markets aside, Goldman Sachs is hugely exposed to the effects of Coronavirus as over half their branch locations and financial offerings, investments, corporate lending are in countries under lockdown or severely hit**\n\nWe also have definite proof that GS is heavily involved in developing countries examples:\n\n* [2014 Libya Wealth Fund Lawsuit](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-08-19/goldman-sachs-drops-bid-to-throw-out-libyan-wealth-fund-suit)\n\n* [2018 Lawsuit in Indonesia with Property Tycoon Hanson International](https://www.reuters.com/article/indonesia-goldman-sachs-lawsuit/goldman-loses-indonesia-court-appeal-in-hanson-share-ownership-dispute-idUSL4N1UG24D)\n\n* [2019 1MDB Corruption scandal](https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Goldman-Sachs-in-talks-to-pay-2bn-to-settle-1MDB-probe-source2) <- Netflix Dirty Money has a great episode on this too\n\nAlso, of all Wall Street Banks, GS and BOA are the ones that really recovered to their pre-2008 prices. In Jan 2008, GS was trading at 198 a share before dropping to 67 a share in Dec 2008. In Jan 2020, GS trading at 231 a share, and currently trading at 146 a share. \n\nHere's my speculation:\n\n* Coronavirus has an incubation time between 14-27 days. The short term impact is already seen and mostly priced in, with the large first plunge at the end of Feb.\n\n* However due to the long incubation and asymptomatic spread, there is usually a second spike in cases about 1-1.5 months later.\n\n* As we can see from other countries, even IF the local community spread is stopped, the number of cases continue to rise due to imported cases (Imported cases refer to travelers arriving to the country, students returning from overseas and other citizen recall)\n\n* Therefore the actual extent of lockdown differs based on how many citizens were abroad - these imported cases EXTEND the period of lockdown and social distancing even when no new community cases appear\n\n* Most companies have only changed their earnings guidance for 1st quarter, or in some cases like General Electric who supplies to Boeing [have not changed their guidance at all](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/03/15/general-electric-maintains-guidance-but-for-how-mu.aspx)\n\n* Summer is one of the biggest consumer seasons in the USA; since restaurants and tourism make full use of extended hours daylight savings, then you have summer blockbuster movies etc etc\n\n* Effects are multiple: SMEs gonna start defaulting, chinese factories still not at full capacity, chinese/SEA millionaires not gonna make huge investments, wealth management not looking so hot, recession is a bad year for IPOs, so companies that were planning to move forward with IPOs aren't going to, developing countries gonna struggle with repayments and their currency will fall against the US dollar (already seeing signs of this 100 PH Peso = 1.95 USD)\n\n* Banks going to get hit after 2 consecutive quarters of poor earnings, particularly true for super exposed global banks (BOA is another global bank, you just have to look at their earnings under Merill Lynch since they have so many spun off divisions)\n\n**tl;dr: GS 100P 10/16 BOA 14P 10/16**", "created_utc": 1584715393.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flw4yg/goldman_sachs_global_overexposure_repo_market/", "is_self": true}
