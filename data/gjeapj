In general these tickers are set to make moves up or down, like high volatility.\n\nSo the list of tickers which has getting a lot of new interest the last week :\n\n- OPK\n- MRNA\n- VTIQ\n- INSG\n-GAN\n-STNG\n- BCRX\n-LVGO\n-AYTU\n\nReally wondering if this is useful to wsb, can make a weekly topic of this.\n\nDon\u2019t hold any positions and not sure why last post got deleted.", "created_utc": 1589426457.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gjeapj/potential_new_meme_stocks/", "is_self": true}
