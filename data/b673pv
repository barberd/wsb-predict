They have been on an economic run for the last 10 years, both in their debt per capita and their infamous boom in housing prices (thank the Chinese). If you look at their household debt to GDP today and compare that to the US's in 2008 (subprime collapse), it's close to the same.\n\nhttps://d3fy651gv2fhd3.cloudfront.net/embed/?s=unitedstahdtg&amp;v=201903190853a1&amp;d1=20060327&amp;d2=20190327&amp;title=false&amp;url2=/canada/households-debt-to-gdp&amp;h=300&amp;w=600\n\nHere America reached 98% peak, while Canada has been at 100% debt of GDP for the last 2 years.\n\nI've been watching Canada for a long time, and it's been very hard to short. They've been able to bounce back on any minor setback. Housing prices tumble 40% in Toronto, but their GDP and banks keep growing. Unemployment rate shoots up, but 50k jobs created next month. A quarter of negative GDP growth, but then reversed next quarter. Hence, no recession since 2008 while Canadians keep on taking on more debt.\n\nBut I think it's time.\n\nTheir banks are starting to put aside heavy loan loss provisions. Here, I put down the biggest banks in Canada and their loan loss provisions increase.\n\nTD - 22.7%\n\nRBC - 54%\n\nBMO - (3%)\n\nBNS - 26%\n\nCIBC - 120%\n\nI'll add more once I have time. I want to emphasis, that this COULD be it. COULD be. These things take a while to play out, and some financial panic might not happen until Q4 of this year. However, the odds are good for a short, since Canadians are hitting a ceiling on how debt they can take on. Therefore, more downward space than upward space.
