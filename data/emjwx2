I was away from my devices on Tuesday night when the bombs dropped. I actually lost money from my longs that triggered stops while I was away. Just wondering what the biggest movers are that I am not thinking of? I know a couple of you posted screen shots Tuesday night, but I can't seem to find them. \n\nI know I can sell ES, NQ and YM and Buy Oil and Gold. I don't want to go too crazy, rather just buy more contracts on 5 rather than spread it out over 20 but was wondering if I should just stick to these 5 or if I am missing something that moves even more that I am missing? I know I could research it, was just hoping to save some time if some of you wouldn't mind letting me know. Hopefully this doesn't play out, but I just want to be ready this time if possible.
