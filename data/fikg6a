{"id": "fikg6a", "title": "PSA: Don\u2019t use goddamn market orders for options", "selftext": "So like 99% of yall I have absolutely no idea what I\u2019m doing. Traded my first option ever a week ago and now I\u2019m making 50K yolo trades like the degenerate gambler I am.\n\nSo yesterday I sold a put option. I know, super gay, feel free to roast me already. I\u2019m a \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b at heart, but sometimes you just got to dip your toe in the water to see how it feels on the other side, ya know? Anyway my retard luck continues to shine and the stock shoots up 5% right away. I see I\u2019m already 10% up on the trade and I go with my \ud83e\uddfb\ud83e\udd32 to push the close button. I stop to bask in the glory of my retarded gains, and it\u2019s showing that I actually lost tendies on the trade. WTF?!? Yea, I\u2019m a true retard, the spread was super huge and some algo capitalized on my market order.\n\nAnyways, stay \ud83c\udf08 out there but at least use some goddamn protection; limit orders are your friend. I know that this isn\u2019t some great revelation or anything, but most of yall are just as retarded as I am. And if youre smarter than me then fuck you and go back to r/investing.\n\nTl;dr\nMarket orders on open for $DIS 3/19 150c", "created_utc": 1584201230.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fikg6a/psa_dont_use_goddamn_market_orders_for_options/", "is_self": true}
