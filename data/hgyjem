Data scientists, accountants, real estate professionals, the list goes on. It is best comparable to FVRR, a company that does less revenue, has negative cash flow, but has absolutely fucking rocketed this year. \n\n**Going by the numbers:**\n\nUPWK **2019 Revenue** $301MM vs FVRR $107MM\n\nUPWK **TTM FCF** \\+13.6MM vs FVRR -10.5MM\n\n**TTM Sales Multiple** = UPWK 4.2x vs FVRR 16.2x\n\n**Market Cap** = UPWK 1.625B vs FVRR 2.334B\n\nFVRR does has UPWK beat in growth, with FVRR posting 44% Y/Y vs UPWK 21%.\n\nAm I a bitch for thinking UPWK is going to rocket? Maybe. Is my short track record poor? Yes, but that is my fault for yolo'ing on weeklies. I have since evolved.\n\nI thought the same piss missile was coming in early May.
