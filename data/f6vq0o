Things will recover quickly. I managed to sell Spce this morning and accept a loss on MSFT for this week and sold before it dipped anymore. 2020 is the year of the autist just try to keep a cool g or 2 on standby and wait for this to blow over. I literally turned 1k into 5k on a Spce leap call (minimal tendies) we are all only like 5 yolos away from a million. Idk the suicide hotline but anyone who wants to drop it pls do. We are all in this together brothers I love you all and have a great weekend!", "created_utc": 1582216900, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6vq0o/your_life_is_important/", "is_self": true}
