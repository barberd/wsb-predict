I've screened some options yesterday to find some low premium, low IV options that are highly undervalued at the moment. They are mainly mid-cap tech/finance companies that have promising guidance for the coming weeks, so I've shortlisted\u00a0a couple 6/19 calls for you. Let me know what you think.\u00a0\n\n**Upland Software Inc** (UPLD):\u00a0\n\n* Upland is a cloud-based enterprise work management software that was somehow overlooked in the past couple of weeks. Few days ago, the company\u00a0announced financial and operating results for the first quarter of 2020 with an increase of 40% in revenue from Q1 2019 to Q2 2020. And yet, the stock is currently trading at $27 which is 38% less than its pre-Covid highs of $43, so there is significant room for growth\n* Upland's strong\u00a0Q1 performance and revised guidance demonstrates Upland\u2019s resilience as the company navigates the COVID-19 pandemic. Their products products have helped customers succeed in this new remote working environment\n* Upland\u2019s enterprise customer base, high recurring revenue, retention and margins, limited exposure to highly impacted sectors, strong balance sheet, and flexible cost structure positions the company well to emerge from the pandemic\n* UPLD play: **35c 6/19 - IV: 65%**\n\n**Virtu Financial** (VIRT):\u00a0\n\n* Virtu Financial is a high-frequency trading firm that quotes buy and sell prices for stocks, options and profits on the spread. The heightened volatility in the first quarter led to a spike in trading volume, which has, in turn, generated increased revenue\n* Virtu delivered strong earnings and record revenue in the first quarter, another solid report for a stock that's gained about 50% this year\n* The number of trades in the market is expected to continue as volatility will remain due to COVID-19 pandemic, and these guys seem to know what they are doing - they are not fully retards like WSB traders\n* VIRT play: **25c 6/19 - IV: 39%**\n\n**Inseego** (INSG):\u00a0\n\n* Inseego is a small-cap telematics company that designs and develops mobile, Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud-based services for enterprise customers, service providers and small- and medium-sized businesses. For example, they provide wireless 3G, 4G and 5G hardware products for the federal government's First Responder Network (including COVID-19 first response teams)\n* Inseego is seeing strong demand driven by the work from home, distance learning and telehealth trends and this momentum is set to continue.\u00a0Accelerating sales are expected to help the company swing to profitability in 2021\n* Despite beating their Q1 earnings, the company is still trading around\u00a0$10, which is 30% below their highs from late April ($14) due to the recent dip. There are many low IV, low premium calls available at the moment\n* INSG play: **15c 6/19 - IV: 103%**\n\nEdit: Positions below, bought them this morning. Unfortunately it's a red market but UPLD is still up\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y5loxfr5oqy41.png?width=329&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1e03a55d72c70acc5e9ec67f125a71b9bce17eb", "created_utc": 1589464075.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gjmob1/three_companies_with_stellar_guidance_for_those/", "is_self": true}
