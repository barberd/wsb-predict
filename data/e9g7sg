I saw that the ADBE earnings call was tomorrow so I bought $330 calls when the strike price was about $303. I bought 2 contracts for $32 and they are now worth $500 (1,462%) and you know I\u2019m selling them tomorrow morning before they expire. I know its not a lot of money but as a kid this is decent change. So far my account is up 142% since the start of school (September 4th) I\u2019ve been doing some classic wall street bets but drop a few zeroes, but this one surpasses my best day trade....", "created_utc": 1576111885, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e9g7sg/1462_in_one_day_trade_on_adbe_calls/", "is_self": true}
