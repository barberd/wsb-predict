{"id": "bz3n4w", "title": "Short/Put AMD", "selftext": "Seems like everyone right now has the consensus of AMD going the moon. Well, I'm here to tell you you're *fucking wrong*.\n\nListen, at the moment AMD's at an ATH. And if you would take a look at its YTD chart you'll see that it's about to have it's double-top; or, in short, it's about to hit that high it's hit before and once it hits that high/its resistance (again) at 34-34.85, AMD's going to have another dramatic pullback. I don't know how much but if you look at the last pullback then you can probably estimate by how much percentage it'll drop this week.\n\nIf you give me any E3 bullshit-- don't. E3's all hype. Repeat. All hype. Everything they're announcing won't even be considered in their quarterly revenues and other financials till 2020 holiday season. That includes Project Scarlett, Zen III Architect, etc. \n\nBtw, SPY's due for a pullback too. Both will either happen tomorrow or Wednesday. Just a matter of time. Get out before the sea of red hits you. \n\nThis really isn't due diligence but it's pattern spotting. Look at the patterns, don't trade on hype.", "created_utc": 1560202398, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bz3n4w/shortput_amd/", "is_self": true}
