{"id": "hdwpqc", "title": "NKLA- how an owner of stock locked in $7.35 with minimum risk by this Friday's close", "selftext": "On a quiet day in the market, noticed someone paid $7.35 to lock in a borrow on  NKLA stock till this Friday's close.  That's 7.35% over 5 days.\n\nCouple of interesting takeaways\n\n1. Folks who are long NKLA stock should be getting paid a lot by their broker. Their broker is probably lending out their long stock and getting paid super high rates.\n2. If longs are not getting paid by their broker, they may want to replace long stock with long deep in the money calls and short the same strike put. For example, the above trade was on the $100 strike to minimize the chance of early exercise. Getting paid $7.35 to sell stock, buy call, sell put.\n\nsold 1,450 06/26/2020 $100.0 c $0.2bought 1,450 06/26/2020 $100.0 p $40.7bought 145,000 shares at $66.85\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSources:\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NKLA/options?p=NKLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NKLA/options?p=NKLA)\n\n[https://www.volsage.com/activityInName.php?ticker=nkla](https://www.volsage.com/activityInName.php?ticker=nkla)", "created_utc": 1592847073.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hdwpqc/nkla_how_an_owner_of_stock_locked_in_735_with/", "is_self": true}
