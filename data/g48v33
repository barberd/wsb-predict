Can we combine our supreme intellect to beat the big gay institutions?\n\nSince all of us specialize in options, why not see where our collected brain cells can take us? In this post, you will be able to comment an option position. My bot will automatically add your option to a list and track its performance. At the end of the week, I'm going to post the results of how we did.\n\n**Rules:**\n\n1. One option trade per comment.\n2. The bot will **NOT** execute the trades replied to a comment.\n3. Don't get caught by your wife's boyfriend. If he finds out we are banding together, he will turn off the internet!\n\n**Comment Format:**\n\n* Ticker StrikeDirection M/DD/YY\n\n**Comment Examples:**\n\n* SPY 300c 5/15/20\n* SPY 250p 5/15/20\n\n**DON'T FUCK UP THE SYNTAX.** Although I have been gifted divine intellect, my coding skills are still retarded (just like us).\n\nGood luck!", "created_utc": 1587307723.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g48v33/rwallstreetbets_fund_i_made_a_bot_that_buys_the/", "is_self": true}
