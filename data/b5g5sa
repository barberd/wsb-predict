Or maybe I'm just not seeing it. Do I even want to sell them yet? I didn't really know what I was getting into when I bought them so I just wrote off the money as a loss but by some miracle its at like 5.05$ a share now. Any insight?\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "created_utc": 1553546817, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b5g5sa/cprx_calls_hit_5_strike_price_but_now_how_do_i/", "is_self": true}
