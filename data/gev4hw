{"id": "gev4hw", "title": "Insider Monkey SEC Form 4", "selftext": " [https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/purchases/](https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/purchases/) \n\nThis covers SEC Form 4 disclosures which requires insiders, defined as management, directors, and shareholders of a certain size, to report their purchases and sales to the public.  (The 2 other SEC insider forms are 3 and 5 which are not covered here for purposes of discussion).  \n\nThere is a lag of reporting time before the results post but they include the time of buy or sale, number of shares, insider's positions, price for cost basis, current holdings of that stock, etc.  \n\nNow insiders buy or sell their shares for any number of reasons but usually a buy indicates a strong conviction in the belief of the direction.  Buying is usually more stronger of an indicator than selling. Why? \n\nThe other reason would be that the insider is forced to sell because he/she has a conflict of interest due to an upcoming political appointment, board position with another company, etc.  \n\nBy the way you can also search by typing in the ticker symbol of the company you are interested in the top right corner and seeing all the news flow.\n\nSome interesting ones that stand out in no particular order: \n\nWH, LGF, DAL, then a whole bunch of financials like community banks, movies, all troubled sectors.", "created_utc": 1588807557.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gev4hw/insider_monkey_sec_form_4/", "is_self": true}
