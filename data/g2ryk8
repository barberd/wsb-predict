{"id": "g2ryk8", "title": "Peloton DD", "selftext": "First DD post...   Got left bag holding puts after following VS's posts... turns out 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 is not my style.  Hope this helps you make some money back.\n\nLet's talk fundamental of Peloton (PTON).  Yeah, there's only one . New subscribers.  The fucks that have been buying up the stock from it's $17.70 low about 30 days ago to the $38.08 all-time high today think there are going to be a lot of them because the Chinese lab virus is keeping us from doing our bicep curls in the squat rack at Planet Fitness and enjoying a nice pizza afterwards. \n\nMy gf insisted last August that we buy a Peloton bike.  $3,000 later, we have some nice shoes that you can barely walk in and a stationary bike that costs more than a car does per month to run these days.  I use it a few times a week.  It's a good work out and I have a soft spot for Dennis.  \n\nBut I digress.  The real problem here is that Peloton's subscriber's are not mooning like some SPY just mainlined JPow tendies.   And I think I have proof to back it up from data made available in Peloton's own API.\n\nI don't know Python very well, so I paid some dude from Sri Lanka $30 on UpWork to write a script to scrape some data from Peloton's website.  Took him like 5 minutes to figure out they have an API that makes this data pretty easy to get if you have any coding experience that goes beyond recording VBA macros.     So he wrote me a script that exports their workout data by workout, going back for all of the workouts they still have on line (\\~2016).\n\nNow here's where my first-hand experience comes in to play.  When you first sign up, Peloton pushes  some easy-ass \"Beginner\" workouts, and like a good noob, you do those work outs once or twice before you move on to the real shit.\n\nCheck out this history by quarter going back to 2016.  It shows the number of Beginner workouts as a % of total workouts, and Beginner classes as a % of total classes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ko0k9g96z9t41.png?width=727&format=png&auto=webp&s=035a8395128e72fb43d8326a73e4e9737f5c6b36\n\nNotice anything about the % of beginner workouts and classes in that period?  It ain't mooning.  In Q2, they had significant subscriber growth (Christmas), and the beginner workouts over-indexed the beginner classes.  In Q3, for one of only 2 times in the entire history, the % of Beginner classes and % of Beginner workouts were roughly in proportion.  \n\nMy simple hypothesis is that if Planet fitness members were truly giving up (which let's be honest, they already did by joining Planet fitness for $10 a month to feel good about having a gym membership), then noobs should be pumping Beginner workouts.  The workout data does not show it.\n\nIn a couple of weeks, Peloton is going to report their earnings and also their subscriber growth for Q3.  \n\nPeloton's previously published end-of-year guidance is to hit 930,000 subscribers.  They were at 712k from the last earnings report, and using an exponential growth function because I couldn't find it online, their pre-corona subscribers should be around 833k at end of Q3.\n\nUsing some fancy multiple regression against historical subscriber growth, my prediction is that they **MEET** their subscriber growth target, but this will be a **HUGE** disappointment to all of the Wallstreet bros that think Peloton subscriptions are mooning right now due to stay-at-home corona economy.  They will also report HIGHER user engagement, because current Peloton owners are doing more workouts.  But retention and engagement isn't really the play.\n\nTLDR: Peloton subscriber growth will MEET previous guidance, but fall below the consensus analyst estimates for growth, which will be a huge disappointment and send the stock that has ballooned from $17.70 low 30 days ago to $38.08 all-time-high today, spiraling down.\n\nPositions: May puts <$30", "created_utc": 1587085522.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2ryk8/peloton_dd/", "is_self": true}
