They stay home? But have they ever shut it down before. How does that work?\n\nEdit: Thanks for the answers. \nTLDR: since 9/11 it\u2019s no biggie they can shut it down whenever they want. \n\nSecond edit: to everyone saying no one is there every day at open and close there are like 200 people in a room. So some people are there. \n\nForgot to add \n\nSPY P200 4/17 VXX C50 3/13. \n\nFeel free to ban now.\n\nEdit 3. Feee DD\n\nHere is the reason for 200 spy mid April. I call it the inverse ghost buster bet. \n\nIf I\u2019m wrong. The 200p is inexpensive and hooray the world didn\u2019t end. I\u2019ll lose a couple thousand happily. But if I\u2019m right? \n\nLenny... I will have just predicted the demise of millions of registered voters.
