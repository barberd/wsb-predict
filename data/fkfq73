That compares to 70 percent who responded the same way on February 10th.\n\nDespite that positive view, 57 percent of voters say it's very or somewhat likely that there will be an economic recession in the next year, and 39 percent say it's not so likely or not likely at all. This is little changed from voters who said 56 - 37 percent that a recession was very or somewhat likely in October 2019.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntldr: 2/3 of Americans are still clueless\n\nSPY 3/27 $230p\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Poll was conducted March 5-8th so before a couple of the big drops BUT well after the market had already fallen 10% since ATH in February.", "created_utc": 1584488874.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkfq73/66_of_americans_say_the_economy_is_excellent_or/", "is_self": true}
