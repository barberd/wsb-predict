Russia I'm sure would welcome the collapse.\n\nThe end of the PetroDollar system would just absolutely destroy the western financial markets. Long term all the USD that is outside the US would come flooding back into the US. Inflation would be insane.\n\nIn the past the USA used bombs to keep the system going, but can the US really attack SA or Russia at this point? What can the US really do to stop the end of the PetroDollar system if they wanted it to collapse? US is weak now, if they wanted out, now is the time. \n\nSA did not set a May price, is this because they want to make a deal with Trump and friends saving the US shale industry? Or do the want to price it in a different unit?? \n\nI'm not saying it will happen, just want to see what you all think. Call me an autard all you want, just bounce some ideas off me.\n\nI'm long physical gold, non US land, and have 100k USD in SPY puts from mid April to late June.\n\nEdit: Changed \"Petrol Dollar\" to \"PetroDollar\" Yes, I'm an autard, but that can't be my biggest mistake.", "created_utc": 1586094849.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fve3iq/could_this_oil_war_be_the_end_of_the_petrol_dollar/", "is_self": true}
