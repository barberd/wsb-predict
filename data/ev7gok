The basics, though, are this:  Peloton sued two of its main competitors, Flywheel Sports and Echelon Fitness.  Both Flywheel and Echelon produce spin bikes you can ride at home by viewing online classes.  Peloton's lawsuits claim the competitors infringe Peloton's patents, for which it seeks injunctions and damages.  Flywheel's main defense to the suit is patent invalidity.  Echelon has not yet filed an answer, instead moving to dismiss the complaint.\n\nFor the non-lawyers, a patent is a license to sue.  If you suspect a competitor has \"borrowed\" too much of your invention, your redress is to bring a lawsuit for patent infringement which lets you seek money damages and/or court order forcing the competitor to stop selling/producing the product.\n\nAmong a defendant's available defenses, one is to prove the patent is invalid, as in, it shouldn't have been given by the USPTO in the first place.  There are several legal theories behind which a patent can be invalidated, including prior art, for obviousness and anticipation.  This is what Flywheel is arguing.\n\nWhat this article doesn't tell you is that Flywheel also simultaneously with the lawsuit filed an *Inter Partes Review* with the USPTO.  An IPR proceeding asks the Patent and Trademark Office to review the patents and determine if they are valid.  If the IPR proceeding is successful from the defentant's point of view, it can seriously strengthen it's defense to the lawsuit.  Now, while the IPR proceeding was pending, Flywheel sought to stay the lawsuit until the IPR concluded.  (A \"stay\" is a legal term of art that essentially means pause.)  The court denied this request for reasons that are not necessarily germane to this discussion.  The effect of this denial is that the lawsuit and IPR proceeding are still moving at the same time.\n\nAccording to the current Scheduling Order, trial in the Flywheel case is set to begin in the middle of June.  Between then and now, a significant amount of legal \"crap\" has to happen.  This \"crap\" will generate significant legal expenses.  At the end of the trial, Peloton could find itself with three invalidated patents.  Even if the trial goes well, the IPR proceeding hangs over its head, and even if there is no invalidity finding, holes in the patent's armor will be found.\n\nWhy is this important?\n\nMuch of the conjecture in the article addresses whether or not the patents will be invalidated.  Frankly, I don't care.  **Peleton will never let either the Flywheel case or the Echelon case go to trial and run the risk of an invalidity finding.** **Both cases will settle**. Think about it.  Why would you run this risk?\n\nWhen will that happen?\n\nThat is the $64,000 question.  But figure sometime between now, and June 15, the first day of Jury selection.  (The Flywheel case is much further along than Echelon.  Flywheel case was filed in September 2018.  The Echelon case was filed in October 2019.)\n\nCalls or Puts?\n\nCalls.  The impact of a settlement on share price is difficult to analyze, but settlement is a positive outcome and  will be looked at favorably from investors.  The settlement allows the business to continue as is - with the presumption that the patents are valid and the business realizes a reduction in legal expenses.\n\nI would not expect a 30% gain on news of a settlement (although anything is possible, and in contrast, an invalidity finding would be extremely problematic from a competition standpoint).  $PTON stock, so far, has show immunity (no pun intended) to the corona virus; it's earnings report is scheduled for Feb 5.  A large pre-earning run up could render neuter the good news of a settlement.  Anything above a 10% gap up I'd say is a win.\n\nThe Flywheel case is in the Eastern District of Texas, Case No.: 19-cv-00390.  The Echelon case is in the District of Delaware, Case No.: 19-cv-1903.\n\nTl;dr:\n\n1. Peloton sued two companies in 2018 and 2019 for patent infringement.  One company is defending by arguing its patents are invalid.  Trial scheduled to commence in mid June 2020.\n2. Peloton won't run the risk of having patents invalidated at trial.  Cases will settle.\n3. If you agree PTON will settle, buy calls.  Upside from calls from settlement news is limited, because of corona virus volatility and upcoming earnings, but settlement is a favorable outcome.\n4. The only conclusive date for choosing expiry is that the Flywheel trial starts on June 15.", "created_utc": 1580227928, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ev7gok/beckys_tits_will_sag_but_today_they_are_firm_pton/", "is_self": true}
