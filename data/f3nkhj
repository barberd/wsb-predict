Here\u2019s why:\n\nBulls are incredibly aerodynamic! Studies even show that they are are more aerodynamic than a Jeep Wrangler! If you put a cow in a wind tunnel it performs extremely well! \n\n[bullWindTunnel](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=goucqTkRAP0)\n\n[AeroBull](https://imgur.com/gallery/szEwno4)\n\nImagine a bull surfing on top of the S&amp;P 500 chart line. Time passing moves the bull right. He flys majestically higher and higher! Bulls love eating grass. (more than I love sucking cock) With his head pointing downward to eat (probably tendies) he increases his efficiency while and allowing more velocity to run under his dick which naturally forces him upwards at a  steady pace. When he is done eating and just chillin\u2019. (probably watching bears masturbating in the woods) His head then rises causing a disruption in downforce. This cause the bull to shoot upwards almost in a parabolic nature!
