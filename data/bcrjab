Good morning and happy Saturday to all of you on this subreddit. I hope everyone made out pretty nicely in the market last week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 15th, 2019.\n\n# **Some optimistic corporate outlooks in the week ahead could lift the stock market to a record  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/12/get-ready-for-companies-to-tell-you-more-about-the-economy.html)**\n*****\n&gt; It\u2019s now up to corporate America to reveal whether the U.S. economy simply hit a soft patch this winter, as many suspect, or is on the verge of falling into an even deeper rut.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings from a broad swath of industries, like financials, technology, transportation and consumer products roll out in the coming week as the first-quarter earnings season gets underway. According to Refinitiv, earnings are expected to decline 2.3 percent in the first negative quarter in three years, but it is business leaders\u2019 comments on the future outlook that are even more important.\n*****\n&gt; Commentary and guidance is always a big deal, but this quarter it is critical. Analysts do not agree on whether the first quarter earnings season represents the trough, or even whether the second quarter will see a gain or decline in profit growth.\n*****\n&gt; At the same time, economic data, like March\u2019s jobs report, are beginning to turn more positive, and first quarter growth has quickly gone from forecasts of nearly flattish back in January to now around 2%, on the back of better March releases. The economic data has been uneven, in part because of the government shutdown, but it has yet to prove the economy is back on track.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market has been very sensitive to data that\u2019s been picking up. The market is reflecting that, even though there\u2019s talk of an earnings recession. What you don\u2019t want is an earnings recession leading to an economic recession. If companies believe there\u2019s a major downturn in revenue growth, they stop spending and ultimately they fire people and that leads to a recession,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.\n*****\n&gt; The stock market is also at an important inflection point, with the major indexes closing in on all-time highs. The S&amp;P 500 pressed through 2,900 Friday, seen as a point of psychological resistance. The S&amp;P ended the week at 2,907, for a weekly gain of 0.5%. The next target traders are watching is the closing high 2,930 on the S&amp;P. The all-time high was an intraday 2,940, reached on Sept. 21.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings season got off to a good start with J.P. Morgan Chase\u2019s quarterly earnings report Friday. CEO Jamie Dimon was very positive, saying the U.S. economy\u2019s expansion \u201ccould go on for years.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf you look at the American economy, the consumer is in good shape, balance sheets are in good shape, people are going back to the workforce, companies have plenty of capital,\u201d Dimon told analysts during a conference call. J.P. Morgan stock rose sharply, after its record profits beat analysts\u2019 expectations.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cPositive guidance, that\u2019s what the market needs. [The S&amp;P] could cross 2,900, but then again it could pull back,\u201d said Krosby, but she said the momentum has been pointing higher. \u201cThe market has basically been endorsing 2,900 and beyond.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Krosby said important upcoming economic reports include Empire State and Philadelphia Fed surveys Monday and Thursday respectively, for a current look at manufacturing activity in New York and the Mid-Atlantic region. There is also industrial production and retail sales Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cJobs data was strong. Everybody was really negative on the economy, and now we\u2019re getting pleasant surprises,\u201d said Marc Chandler, Bannockburn Global Forex chief market strategist. The economy added 196,000 jobs in March, bringing the monthly average to 180,000 over the past three months, even with February\u2019s shockingly low 33,000 payrolls.\n*****\n&gt; Chandler said industrial production and other data should show an improved trend over last month.\n*****\n&gt; As stocks have shaken off growth fears, bond yields have also moved higher. The 10-year Treasury note was yielding 2.55% Friday, well above the lows of 2.34% reached on March 28.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://finviz.com/publish/041219/sec_all_w1_173223326.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/bTR4L0w.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/gFrOIB2.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/G83UM3g.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pwyn0Ng.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zqiOyQk.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AupfSGV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/8OCC1LQ.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/k261h7u.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/4cMhMGZ.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/zqydCfr.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/YRS4OHb.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical April Trading: Mid-Month Surge Stronger Second Half\n\n&gt; Over the recent 21 years April is the top-ranked month for DJIA. April ranks #3 S&amp;P 500, #5 for NASDAQ, #2 for Russell 1000 and #4 for Russell 2000. Average gains over the period range from a low of 1.19% by NASDAQ to a respectable 2.29% by DJIA. The first half of April used to outperform the second half, but since 1994 that has no longer been the case. In fact the second half of April is stronger over the recent 21-year period.\n\n&gt; Early April trading is usually positive for the first 4 days then flattens off until mid-month. Then the market tends to surge from the tenth to the fifteenth trading days. DJIA tends to close out the month strongest with NASDAQ closing weakest.\n\n&gt; Except for DJIA weighed down by Boeing (BA), stocks are having an above average month so far, which is quite typical in Pre-Election years where April has tended to be even stronger.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/eeb28454921d52ecd051d64904659304/tumblr_inline_pprlh3o8X51spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Claims Bode Well For Equities\n\n&gt; Earlier today on our Twitter account, we retweeted a chart from Bloomberg's Joe Weisenthal of inverted Jobless Claims versus the S&amp;P 500. We have used this chart as an argument for the bullish case for the past several years. As we mentioned in a blog post this morning, Initial Jobless Claims came in earlier this week with a sizable drop off, down to 196K versus last week's revised 204K and expectations of 210K. This week's print was not only a new low for the current cycle, it is also the lowest reading since 1969. That sort of new low could be a good sign for equities. As shown in the chart below, claims and the S&amp;P have mirrored each other since bottoming following the financial crisis. (In the chart, we have inverted claims on the right axis.) As the S&amp;P 500 inches its way back towards all time highs, so has claims towards new lows. Additionally, with recent low prints for claims bucking what had previously appeared to be an upside trend reversal, the bullish case for the S&amp;P 500 is growing.\n\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/041119-Claims-vs-SP.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Optimism Growing Again\n\n&gt; The American Association of Individual Investors updated their weekly investor sentiment survey this morning and the results are very similar to the final days of February with bullish sentiment around 40%, bearish down near 20%, and neutral once again in the upper 30's. Up from 35.02% last week, bullish sentiment has crossed back over the 40% threshold; the first time it has done so since the previously mentioned week in February. While bullish sentiment is sitting a couple of points above the historical average, this is still several percentage points from reaching any sort of extreme level (more than one standard deviation above the aforementioned average). For that to happen, bullish sentiment would have to come in above 48.36%. If that occurs, then it could be a sign that investors are getting a little too optimistic.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/041119-AAII-Bullish-Sentiment.png))**\n\n&gt; Bearish sentiment, on the other hand, fell all the way back down to 20.38% this week, the lowest since its 20% reading on February 28th. That is around 10% less than the historical average for bearish sentiment. That is also at the lower end of the range bearish sentiment has stayed within in the past decade.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/041119-AAII-Bearish-Sentiment.png))**\n\n&gt; Neutral sentiment has still yet to have moved above or below the upper 30's coming in at 39.33% this week after falling from similar levels down to 36.71% last week. That is the third time in the past month that neutral sentiment has come in between 39% and 40%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/041119-AAII-Neutral-Sentiment.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# The December Low Indicator Has Bulls Smiling\n\n&gt; After the best first quarter for the S&amp;P 500 Index since 1998, the big question is: What happens next? We\u2019ve already discussed why a good start to a year could lead to more gains (here and here), but today we will take a look at another potentially positive signal.\n\n&gt; The December Low Indicator was created in the 1970s by Lucien Hooper, a former Forbes columnist and Wall Street analyst. Simply put, the indicator says that if the S&amp;P 500 closes beneath the December low during the first quarter, it\u2019s a warning sign for potential weakness over the balance of the year. The flipside is if it doesn\u2019t, good times could be coming. Given the S&amp;P 500 just went all of the first quarter without closing beneath the December 24 low, it\u2019s worth taking a deeper dive.\n\n&gt; Sure enough, there appears to be some truth to this concept. \u201cThe December low indicator seems quite simple, but it has a tremendous track record,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWhen the S&amp;P 500 stays above the December lows throughout the first quarter, the full year has been higher an incredible 34 out of the last 34 times, which bodes well for 2019.\u201d In fact, this warning even worked last year, as it triggered in the first quarter of 2018 and eventually played out during the big fourth quarter sell-off.\n\n&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, when the S&amp;P 500 stays above the December lows in the first quarter, the full year does quite well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SP500-Index-Yearly-Returns-Nased-on-the-December-Low-Indicator-1950-2018.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for April 12th, 2019** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEhWMqLZI7U))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Are Stocks Going UP Next Week? | Earnings Season Kick-Off! | ShadowTrader Video 04.14.19** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgZML4jp_WI))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$NFLX** \n&gt; * **$BAC** \n&gt; * **$C** \n&gt; * **$GS** \n&gt; * **$UNH** \n&gt; * **$JNJ** \n&gt; * **$APHA** \n&gt; * **$PIXY** \n&gt; * **$SCHW** \n&gt; * **$MTB** \n&gt; * **$PGR** \n&gt; * **$IBM** \n&gt; * **$ABT** \n&gt; * **$MS** \n&gt; * **$PEP** \n&gt; * **$BLK** \n&gt; * **$CMA** \n&gt; * **$TEAM** \n&gt; * **$CSX** \n&gt; * **$KMI** \n&gt; * **$AA** \n&gt; * **$URI** \n&gt; * **$ERIC** \n&gt; * **$WIT** \n&gt; * **$KSU** \n&gt; * **$UAL** \n&gt; * **$PLD** \n&gt; * **$ASML** \n&gt; * **$USB** \n&gt; * **$BK** \n&gt; * **$TXT** \n&gt; * **$FHN** \n&gt; * **$JBHT** \n&gt; * **$ISRG** \n&gt; * **$PNFP** \n&gt; * **$PIR** \n&gt; * **$LVS** \n&gt; * **$MLNX** \n&gt; * **$MBWM** \n&gt; * **$CCI** \n&gt; * **$SKX** \n&gt; * **$BMI**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/k261h7u.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ufAr02D.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY MORNING'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/y3e9UCK.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/ZpBOUvY.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.15.19 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qvpkZGr.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.15.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/a4cvbJc.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.16.19 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZSb5io4.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.16.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/i604cgq.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.17.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uaWkXIX.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.17.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cykytC9.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.18.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nN/A.\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.18.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nN/A.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.19.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.
