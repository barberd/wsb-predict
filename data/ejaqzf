All it had to do was open slightly green and I was raking in tendies...\n\nBUT THE FIRST DAY I TRY TO DO SOMETHING WE GO TO FUCKING WAR!?!?!  \n\nOf course, I saw the AH rally and futures looking strong, I thought for sure I was gonna kill it tomorrow, but instead, I'm literally gonna lose every penny more than likely...  \n\nThis absolutely floors me though... I didn't touch SPY this entire bull market, not once.  I literally played roku mostly, and some other random stocks, but the first day I buy SPY calls, FD's at that, futures plummet because Orange man decided he wanted to provoke a war overnight instead of just letting me make some money... What a bunch of absolute garbage...\n\nPlease kill me.\n\nEdit:  Like the Autist I am, I doubled down on SPY calls this morning and its recovering!!  Wish me luck lol\n\nEdit2:  Im gay... And single handedly ended the Bull market...  Im sorry.  Im very sorry guys.\n\nEdit3: On the bright side, Cramer said its a bad time to buy so inverse Cramer and I might get lucky lol.  But really.  Cramer, the ultimate hype man extraordinaire turns bearish the day I buy Calls.  Literally insane I actually single handedly ended the bull market and started a war.  \n\nWent from up 25% two days ago to down 60% today. Im optimistic. Afterall, money is just paper anyway.  \n\n Final Edit 4: ok.  So.  Rode some dailies all the way up till just now.  Ended up selling on this spike down because I made like 20-30% and it dropped so I decided to take profits instead of holding while this dumpster fire unfolds.  Currently sitting at about down 40% overall, compared to my 2 days ago up 25-30% so not great, but better than my -60% earlier today.  Not gonna lie.  Its been a wild ride, prolly gonna do it again next week, I havent learned shit.  Im either going broke or gonna be rich.  Prolly broke.  But hey, its just paper anyway.  To the idiot that said \"this is on you for buying at ATH\" Its been at ATH for like 10 years bud.  \n\nFinal edit #2:  its my post, I can make as many edits as I want.  Fuck you.   Im dumbfounded I missed that massive drop right there.  Somehow sold my dailies for a gain and bought puts after to spiked down then back up, I bought puts at that top there.  So gonna ride these puts over the weekend as this dumpster fire political environment unfolds.  I assume theres just gonna be a massive cuckfest about to unfold over the weekend thatll give this atleast 1 more red day.  Who knows. Earnings season will turn it all green again im sure and I can cause the recession then too.", "created_utc": 1578028600, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ejaqzf/literally_the_first_time_i_buy_spy_calls_we_go_to/", "is_self": true}
