{"id": "eq9e7h", "title": "Making Money Thanks to Greta!", "selftext": "Now, I don't know much about the market but I don't think I'm nearly as autistic as good old Greta Thunberg. Today BlackRock announced that they're trying to pull investments from fossil fuels in an effort to be climate conscious and look somewhat interested in something other than money. A number of other big investment companies are doing the same (Credit Suisse is getting pressured). It is my belief that a number of companies will pull out money from these investments.\n\nNow, does anything change when companies like BlackRock pull out money from these investments? The trading price of these companies will change, however the underlying asset and the intrinsic value associated with it remains the same. This creates an attractive buying opportunity for investors willing to invest in fossil fuel companies. While the big boy investment funds get peer pressured into pulling investments from fossil fuels, smaller investors who don't care about animal life in Australia are presented with undervalued investment opportunities.\n\nTherefore, if kangaroos and koalas aren't really your cup of tea, I would suggest LONGING fossil fuel companies.", "created_utc": 1579308553, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eq9e7h/making_money_thanks_to_greta/", "is_self": true}
