{"id": "h91wv6", "title": "Bigly expirations this Friday, watch out", "selftext": "This Friday /vx and /es futures expire along with a massive amount of options contracts on $spy and $spx.  One of the ways big options dealers hedge their short $spx options is  by going into /es and going long/short a delta equivalent of futures.  They do the same in $spy by going long/short the underlying.  Right now there is a tremendous amount of option OI in the June 19 expiration.  This means there will likely be a lot of weird stuff happening to the market, especially on Friday when the dealers dump their delta hedges.  Tread carefully and watch the VIX.", "created_utc": 1592169328.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h91wv6/bigly_expirations_this_friday_watch_out/", "is_self": true}
