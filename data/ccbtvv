{"id": "ccbtvv", "title": "Congressional activity: week of 7/15 to 7/19", "selftext": "Good Friday, and welcome to this installment of Congressional activity and financial markets. The general idea is that the statements and actions of federal legislators can have an effect on broader markets. I try to provide interesting happenings as well as participants. I don't suggest any specific positions: I'd like those to come from consensus in the discussion.\n\nA few things to keep in mind:\n\n- All of this is subject to change at any time (i.e. votes can be delayed, hearings can be canceled, witnesses can be struck). The House and Senate operate under their own rules, and those rules are entirely enforced by the chambers themselves.\n- The House is controlled by Democrats, and the Senate is controlled by Republicans. So if a hearing is happening in the House, it is somewhat safe to assume that it reflect a relatively liberal position. However, the committees have representation by both parties, so the discussion won't be entirely one-sided.\n- In general, recorded votes on the ``floor'' of either chamber are taken the most seriously, followed by votes (or hearings) taken by the full committee, followed by votes (or hearings) by a subcommittee.\n- The Senate is generally taken more seriously than the House, since it moves slower and is less likely to produce legislation. Thus, the legislation it does produce is exceptionally important. A corollary, though, is that the Senate has much less activity in any given week (only 100 members, but the same workload [plus appointments] as the 435-member House).\n- The floor schedule of either chamber is notoriously hard to predict more than a day or two in advance, as it is structured almost entirely by party leadership and can change on the whims of that leadership. Hearings, however, are relatively more stable and scheduled. (In other words, the hearings are much more certain to happen, while the votes can be added or subtracted with much less certainty.)\n- This is not all activity, just activity most likely to be relevant to financial markets. There is also no guarantee this activity has an effect on any individual stock or market. I'm not an expert, and this is not advice. It is the beginning of a discussion.\n\n***\n\nResults from last week:\n\n- Congress has been under summer break.\n\n***\n\nShared activity (across both chambers):\n\nBig tech. Facebook will be subject to hearings in both chambers on regulation of its proposed cyptocurrency, in the House on 7/17 (https://financialservices.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=404001) and the Senate on 7/16 (https://www.banking.senate.gov/hearings/examining-facebooks-proposed-digital-currency-and-data-privacy-considerations). The Senate hearings are more explicitly targeted towards ``data privacy considerations,'' which will likely play towards a more negative narrative. \n\nIn addition, on 7/16, House Democrats will take the hammer to big tech on market power and anti-trust (https://judiciary.house.gov/legislation/hearings/online-platforms-and-market-power-part-2-innovation-and-entrepreneurship). FB, GOOG, AAPL, and AMZN will be in attendance (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-congress-tech-antitrust/big-tech-executives-headed-to-capitol-hill-for-antitrust-hearing-next-week-idUSKCN1U42HF). Lastly, GOOG gets its own specific attention during subcommittee hearings in the Senate on 7/16 on censorship through search results (https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/google-and-censorship-though-search-engines). The hearing is chaired by Ted Cruz, who likes bullying GOOG with rhetoric for the cameras. Fun game: take a drink every time Cruz says ``Dragonfly'' (https://www.cruz.senate.gov/?p=press_release&amp;id=4113).\n\n***\n\nHouse activity:\n\nThree items are likely to come to a vote. HR 3493, legislation that authorizes expenditures for intelligence agencies (https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/BILLS-116hr3494ih/pdf/BILLS-116hr3494ih.pdf). There is also an as-yet-unnamed House Resolution that will hold Attorney General Barr and Secretary of Labor Ross in contempt of Congress (https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CRPT-116hrpt125/pdf/CRPT-116hrpt125.pdf). Barr is about Mueller, while Ross is about the 2020 Census battle. The move is largely symbolic. \n\nLastly, the House is likely to vote on HR 582, a bill to increase the minimum wage (https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/BILLS-116hr582ih/pdf/BILLS-116hr582ih.pdf). The bill progresses in five-year installments, capping at $15.00 an hour in five years. The Senate is highly unlikely to pick up similar legislation, but this is likely to be a buzzkill headline. \n\nThe House will hold select committee hearings on 7/16 on heavy-duty vehicles in the climate crisis (https://climatecrisis.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/solving-climate-crisis-cleaning-heavy-duty-vehicles-protecting). The witness list includes a bus manufacturer (Proterra Inc.) that previously worked for TSLA. The hearing might bring additional attention to the TSLA semi-truck program.\n\nThe House will hold subcommittee hearings on 7/16 on spectrum policy for 5G (https://energycommerce.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/hearing-on-our-wireless-future-building-a-comprehensive-approach-to). The witness list is undetermined, but it relates to the 5G spectrum capacity Trump has set as a goal, as well as other legislation to free up the spectrum for development (https://www.multichannel.com/news/house-to-hold-spectrum-policy-hearing).\n\nMueller will testify before the House on 7/17 (https://judiciary.house.gov/legislation/hearings/oversight-report-investigation-russian-interference-2016-presidential-election). It's pretty impossible to know what he's going to say, and it probably won't have much of an effect on the markets. But if he offers some new testimony, or disparages the president in an unexpected way, coupled with the big tech hearings above, could make for a difficult 7/16 and 7/17. \n\nThe House will hold subcommittee hearings on 7/16 on the state of livestock and poultry economies (https://agriculture.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=975), which will probably feature some strong language about the effect of farming and tariffs. In addition, the House will hold subcommittee hearings on 7/17 on the effectiveness of the National Organic Program (https://agriculture.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=976). The second hearing might have delayed effects on organic producers and companies, especially if there's any talk of making regulations easier to meet (https://civileats.com/2019/07/08/after-10-years-of-rapid-growth-what-does-organic-mean-today/). \n\nLastly, the House will hold subcommittee hearings on 7/17 on aviation safety (https://transportation.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/the-subcommittee-on-aviation-hearing-on_--state-of-aviation-safety). The hearing runs the gamut of airframes to airports. The witness list features a crash victim family member from the Ethiopian Airlines crash (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-aviation-safety/house-panel-to-hold-july-17-hearing-on-aviation-safety-idUSKCN1U62S9). It might also implicate the contentious relationship between aircraft certification (by BA) and the FAA. \n\n***\n\nSenate activity: \n\nThe Senate will hold subcommittee hearings on 7/17 on economic mobility and the American Dream (https://www.banking.senate.gov/hearings/economic-mobility-is-the-american-dream-in-crisis). The hearing could highlight negative economic data, especially when paired with attention to the minimum wage legislation mentioned above.\n\nThe Senate will hold special committee hearings on 7/17 on combatting robocall fraud, especially for old people (https://www.aging.senate.gov/hearings/combatting-robocall-fraud-using-telecom-advances-and-law-enforcement-to-stop-scammers-and-protect-seniors). This hearing is oddly specific, but the result might cut into specialized programs from telecommunications companies that offer ``cheap'' services to block all robocalls (https://www.zdnet.com/article/at-t-to-auto-block-fraud-robocalls-for-free-but-blocking-spam-calls-will-cost-extra/). \n\nThe Senate will hold full committee hearings on electric vehicle batteries and the environment (https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/hearings?ID=22DBE78B-11F0-491A-B8FB-7A9F3049F8EF). The hearing is meant to shed light on the tension between the emissions gains of electric vehicles versus the environmental tradeoffs of actual production (https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/336253). It could be potentially damaging to manufacturers if the reputation of being a ``green'' alternative is somewhat dispelled.\n\nAnd, just a reminder, next next week the Senate will pick up hearings on anti-trust and consumer rights (https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/07/23/2019/oversight-of-the-enforcement-of-the-antitrust-laws). That set of hearings is likely to be the biggest mover for big tech.", "created_utc": 1562943081, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ccbtvv/congressional_activity_week_of_715_to_719/", "is_self": true}
