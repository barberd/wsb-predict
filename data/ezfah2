Thailand said 22,000 Wuhan tourists visited Thailand over the Chinese New Years.  Days later it said it was impossible for Thailand to contain the spread of the coronavirus. \n3. Tens of thousands more Wuhan tourists would have visited tourist destinations, sex related and other wise, across SE Asia. \n4. Last Saturday China issued an edict all infected dead must immediately be cremated. In Wuhan the day before the edict the skies were clear, no traffic, no factories operating. A day after that edict the skies were a dingy browning grey. Both reported deaths and infections are a fraction of the actuality. Apply that to the above points. \n5. Every SE Asian tourist sex destination can now be considered an epicenter of coronavirus transmission. \n6.

A logical conclusion is the rest of the SE Asian countries in particular and the rest of the world in general now harbor hundreds to thousands of coronavirus hot spots.\n8. These hot spots will be manifesting over the next two weeks even as they are exporting coronavirus hot spots exponentially. Hot spots, infections, deaths ... all going exponential across the world. \n\nAs the world's supply chains collapse and manufacturing across the world ceases all the central banking hippos in all the world pirouetting in perfect synchronicity will not be able to stop the world's equity markets from imploding.", "created_utc": 1580932422, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ezfah2/an_ironclad_case_for_exiting_equities_immediately/", "is_self": true}
