{"id": "dbvrls", "title": "Prospective trade", "selftext": "Let\u2019s say I have 50 shares of QQQ/spy. I then sell a slightly OTM call spread. I then set a contingent buy if QQQ/spy gets within ~1.00$ of the strike. I also sell the bought call, thus turning the trade into a covered call. If I get assigned, oh well. I just pocketed the spread premium, the increase in option value, and price accrual from buying below the strike price. \n\nAlternatively the stock stay OTM, and I pocket the premium and resell the next week. \n\nOverall the margin is limited to only the call spread until i buy the stock and then sell. Then margin goes up for a few days on a weekly, etc. \n\nWhat risk am I missing here other than the stock tanking while holding 50% in margin loan, which can be mitigated by stop loss?", "created_utc": 1569946876, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dbvrls/prospective_trade/", "is_self": true}
