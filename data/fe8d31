This was especially apparent today as $GILD was green at close and up over 1% after hours. $MRNA was up about a percentage point. \n\nI think these two coronavirus related stocks are trading in pairs as they both have billion dollar capitalizations that are less prone to penny stock like action that you see with some of the other smaller biotechs gaining attention. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[$GILD extremely strong still given negative market backdrop](https://preview.redd.it/n8ev1fsjezk41.png?width=875&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b38dba9c2c23e0b77208017b84b8bf3f811abc3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[$MRNA looks like it's coiling for a move. My inclination is higher](https://preview.redd.it/iubs5dbsezk41.png?width=877&format=png&auto=webp&s=68956d55a14646c03bd07f6d69eb80089f7bc49c)\n\nI don't think it takes a genius to see that these two stocks have been correlating pretty well with each other. My guess is movement in one will give you a clue to the movement in the other. \n\nAs the largest Biotech company in the IBB etf, I think Biotech in general is under owned at least by the Robinhood cohort. Gilead has less than 30k users holding it. This has the potential to increase as coronavirus develops. \n\nDisclaimer : Currently long both $GILD and $MRNA. Given the extremely volatile backdrop of high VIX and 4% daily moves in indices, this is just informational not recommendation.", "created_utc": 1583469993.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fe8d31/gild_and_mrna_relative_strength_in_declining/", "is_self": true}
