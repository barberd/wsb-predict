I have been seeing too much reds in these days and I'm actually worried taking in consideration most of everyone here doesn't either have a job or are worried they may be laid off or something. The market can be a cruel time in these times, but its even worse if you invest in something you don't know, or if you buy puts when the market bottoms because you think its still going to go down or buy calls on high because you think it will still go up. \n\nPeople, one of the most important qualities an investor should have is control, know when to invest, when to wait, and when to not invest. The second most important thing, is doing the proper DD, don't invest in something you don't know how its being influenced (companies, needs for operation, etc) and news you don't fully understand, is better you left them untouched. I remember a few weeks ago when Your president said he was going to declare national emergency and many people bought puts instead of calls because they didn't knew the implication, how that action influenced the market, which was for enabling money. \n\nHave control, don't throw money blindly so learn to read the chart, and know the influences, so you don't buy something thats gonna crash soon. \n\nDon't be a monkey investor.", "created_utc": 1587056539.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2ivg0/who_over_here_is_a_the_market_its_against_me/", "is_self": true}
