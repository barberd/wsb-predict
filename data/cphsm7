Surprisingly they replied.", "selftext": "Dear SEC,\n\nWould it be possible to suggest to Mr Trump to post market-altering tweets only when the market is closed? He is making a few Twitter employees millionaires. Mind Twitter does not publish tweets right away, they hold them for a few seconds and they could trade with a huge advantage.\n\nRegards.\n\n\n-----------------------------\n\nDear Mr. Pacosteles:\n\nThank you for contacting the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nWe appreciate your informing us of your concerns regarding Twitter Inc. (NYSE: TWTR) and President Donald Trump. The SEC\u2019s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy (OIEA) processes many comments received from individual investors and others.  We keep records of the correspondence we receive in a searchable database that SEC staff may make use of in inspections, examinations, and investigations.  In addition, some correspondence received by OIEA is referred directly to other SEC offices and divisions for their review.  If they have any questions or wish to respond directly to your comments, they will contact you.\n\nOnce again, thank you for contacting the SEC.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Redacted name]", "created_utc": 1565640396, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cphsm7/i_shitreported_trump_and_twitter_to_the_sec/", "is_self": true}
