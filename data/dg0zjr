For those of you who listened to the post congrats and for those who didn't, this is your second opportunity.\n\nBanks are going back up so my recommendation is JPM calls or Capital one calls, American Express looks good too. Also, SHOP is trying to recover from the downtrend but this one is like a 50/50.\n\nRemember, this will work if Trump does a partial trade deal or stays neutral so my best recommendation is to wait until the news. If news is positive buy calls, then if negative buy puts on ETF because it has more volume and liquidity which allows you to scape in a any given situation.", "created_utc": 1570726931, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dg0zjr/next_plan_after_yesterdays_spy_call_reference/", "is_self": true}
