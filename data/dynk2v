Over the past year, I\u2019ve slowly turned more autistic and I now have gambled more than $15K into NOK calls.\n\nI\u2019m also up 10% which I\u2019m extremely happy with, but still down 98% overall.\n\nI know to some people that may not be a lot, especially considering how good the market was in early 2019, however, I couldn\u2019t be happier.\n\nI started off not knowing a single thing, I had no one to teach me, so I just read as much as I could, browsed this sub learning from successes and failures.\n\nSimply put, thanks. And if anyone is absolutely new to gambling like I was last year, just do your reading and research, knowing your personal risk tolerance is the key to success.\n\nThanks", "created_utc": 1574184483, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dynk2v/shout_out_to_this_sub_for_helping_me/", "is_self": true}
