Check out this news story: https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/air-canada-passenger-flying-from-montreal-to-vancouver-tested-positive-for-covid-19-1.4824097  \n  \nThe best part?:  \n  \n\"The memo notes that risk of transmission of coronavirus is considered low and crew members from the flight are not required to be quarantined or to stop flying, but are advised to \"self-monitor for 14 days beginning on the day of the flight and report any symptoms to their local public health professionals should they develop.\"  \n  \nYup, that's what Canada thinks because it's scared of being called \"racist\".  Canada apparently hasn't been keeping tabs on the news of how fucking infectious this thing is and doesn't realize that Toretto Virus lives it's life a quarter mile at a time.  Nothing else matters to the virus, not the mortgage, not the store, not its team and all their bullshit. Every ten seconds or less in spends in Canada, it's free...to infect another Canuck.  \n  \nAlready, a new BC, Canada infection was just announced related to this person that was on that flight.  Even the BC Health Minister is now making the statement: Uuuuuhhh...looks like Toretto has gone pandemic (instead of Health Canada's \"risk is low\" stance).  \n  \nYou can have any market trigger you want...as long as it's a Corona.", "created_utc": 1582567898, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f8vczb/toretto_virus_is_coming_to_your_neighbours_in_a/", "is_self": true}
