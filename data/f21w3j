{"id": "f21w3j", "title": "ASSOCIATE POSTS/ACCOUNTS OF ROBINHOOD INFINITE MONEY GLITCH GETTING TAKEN DOWN", "selftext": "Hey everyone, if you don\u2019t remember, I was the one who found a glitch in robinhood\u2019s system where you were able to take advantage of the limit price to give yourself insane gains if the iron condor expires worthless. This happened at the beginning of December of last year. Though most people were not able to take advantage of this as robinhood patched the definite fill to any orders placed by morning. And I know a lot of you degenerates don\u2019t believe that it was true but you just have to take my word.\n\nAnyways recently u/controlthenarrative also known as GUH, had their account either taken down by Reddit, robinhood, or was given the chance to delete it to stop further bad things to happen to him as many believe he probably has court orders for abusing Robinhood\u2019s system, and losing a shitload of their cash. We will probably never know why his account was taken down but the best guess was it was a forced deletion of some kind whether it was reddit, robinhood, or GUH protecting himself.\n\nToday I went onto reddit, and checked my profile and I noticed something very strange. The post where I explained on how to perform this infinite money glitch wasn\u2019t there anymore. (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e4k0l7/robinhood_infinite_money_glitch_step_by_step/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) If you click one that link, you can see that the post was deleted. I contacted u/Jartek about this asking if any moderators took the post off of wallstreetbets. He has yet to respond but even if moderators took the post off of wallstreetbets, it seems that the post should still appear in my account and not have been deleted. I contacted the administration of reddit about this in the morning, the support guide says it should take less than an hour to respond. I have not heard back from reddit at all and I\u2019m getting suspicious now.\n\nI have a theory that Robinhood may be telling reddit to remove anything associated with the infinite money glitch to preserve there reputation. As we all know r/wallstreetbets is the top trending community on reddit, and we have way, way to many normies coming here. As more normies start to open Robinhood accounts and browse through walstreetbets\u2019 history, they may come across all these posts associated with the infinite money glitch. Robinhood wants more normies to join their platform and user base but they won\u2019t get as many people if they don\u2019t have a highly good reputation. \n\nI mean you can call me crazy thinking Robinhood cares about a few people on reddit that may not join Robinhood but it\u2019s a lot more people then we may think. Reddit has over 330 million accounts active.  Robinhood only has 6 million accounts. If only 3/4 of people on wallstreetbets have a Robinhood account, that means we almost make up 1/10 of all of the users on Robinhood! We literally control Robinhood, if everyone on wallstreetbets deleted their Robinhood account, Robinhood would probably have a big downfall. Reddit promotes Robinhood a ton through groups like wallstreetbets and ads on their platform. It makes a lot of sense for Robinhood to preserve their reputation on Reddit. We could break Robinhood again if we wanted to, just like we broke Microsoft\u2019s options!\n\nSo in the end I really do think Robinhood is definitely doing something fishy, (or should I say, tendy) *insert drum hits* on Reddit to preserve their reputation. It makes sense and we have to take control and figure out how to recover GUH\u2019s account and deleted posts of the infinite money glitch. I\u2019ll update you all on if I get a response from reddit. Until then, watch the video I made of GUH\u2019s funeral.
