Nothing is over, this is just getting started. [According to the Imperial College model](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf), we are in a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation: either we enforce wide-scale lockdowns, flatten the curve, and bring down the infection rate, which would have large economic repercussions, or we don't, in which case tons of people die. What the Imperial College researchers failed to take into consideration is that America is full of retards.\n\n[Take a look at this DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fo9cks/did_a_little_dd_on_new_york/) that a brave WSBer from Brooklyn risked his life to bring us. Despite being the epicenter of the US outbreak and probably on track to become the next Wuhan, New Yorkers are still not taking the virus seriously and are congregating in large numbers in parks and beaches. Lockdowns only work if people take them seriously, all it took was one crazy bitch in South Korea who disobeyed doctor's orders to infect 9,000 people.\n\nExtrapolate what's going on in New York to the rest of the country and we can forecast what will happen in the next month or so. One by one, cities across the US will initiate lockdowns as cases spread. While many people will take stay at home orders seriously, just as many won't, and beer flu will fail to be suppressed. We will suffer the economic consequences of widespread lockdowns AND the healthcare consequences of a huge influx of corona cases at once. In other words, both of the disastrous scenarios outlined in the Imperial College research report will happen to us. The US gets double fucked.\n\nThe cherry on top is that [Donnie is already getting impatient](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-03-23/the-war-against-coronavirus-becomes-a-battle-for-trumps-ear) with the lockdowns and we're barely a week into them. To put that into perspective, Wuhan had to be locked down for two months to stop the virus, and that's with the CCP welding people into their apartments. All evidence indicates that Donnie is a minute man and does not have the stamina to push this through long enough to suppress the virus, that even if he did, the collective retardedness of Americans will still fuck us, and that Bill Ackman will probably have another meltdown on CNBC in a few weeks when all this becomes apparent.", "created_utc": 1585085129.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fodjno/hold_on_to_your_puts_the_us_is_about_to_get_spit/", "is_self": true}
