And we just went below the former. \n\nSupport at 2650/2700\n\nHowever. If Covid-19 causes a US recession the market could fall 50%. That\u2019s an if. Although economic activity is just collapsing. \n\nThis is from a friend. Anonymous but v successful macro PM\n\n\nSo what are odds of recession? Well, I think odds of a large outbreak in the US are now high. So really it is about the odds of whether a large outbreak leads to recession. Maybe once it is a global pandemic they give up trying to slow it. But 5% of cases will die without serious medical intervention so they need to try to slow it down to prevent health service being overwhelmed. So I think they cannot just prioritise economy over disease containment.", "created_utc": 1582882705, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fasb1q/whats_next/", "is_self": true}
