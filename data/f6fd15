Today I didn't color code the calls/puts but did color code the companies.\n\nThese   options orders are on or above the ask. Many have the same expiry and   strike. Also lots of the orders were sweeps so these ppl were breaking   down their order to get filled faster.\n\nAlso  all these orders volume of the contracts exceeded the open interest in   multiple trades so it's most likely not closing positions. Either buy  to  open orders or sell to open orders and based on the aggressiveness  of  the orders one can infer its buy to open. Some of these may be  hedges  and some most likely not.\n\nData is here - [https://ibb.co/zrb7LVJ](https://ibb.co/zrb7LVJ)\n\nIt's from 9:30-1:35pm or so.\n\nWatch NVDA again watch TWTR/SONO/AMD\n\nI will say this, don't just enter into positions based on this data  alone in most cases. Use  technicals/fundamentals/options   data-flow/market  sediment all combined  instead of just 1 of these. Use  protection like  spreads if you worry  about losing what u put in and  be  smart,  understand the risks of putting  $ into weekly expiry's,  consider a  longer expiry.", "created_utc": 1582138425, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6fd15/aggressive_option_flow_021920_spceamdnvdatwtretc/", "is_self": true}
