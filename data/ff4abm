The bottom line: the panic is real, but the virus is pure hype. Markets will go down, panic will continue, but the impact of the virus will be negligible once the dust has settled. The panic has been driven almost entirely by fake news media clickbait generation factories trying to capitalize on fear and global stupidity. The panic will likely have some short term economic impact, but in a couple months we'll forget about it and get on with our lives.\n\nFear is a powerful emotion, and this pandemic is mostly about fear. People have seen too many post-apocalyptic movies and think that's what's happening here. The reality, I think, is not nearly as dramatic.\n\nI implore my fellow autists to try and account for the denominator instead of strictly focusing on the numerator. At a global scale, the total number of deaths is tiny and the risk is very low.\n\nLet's look at some data. For starters, take a look at the CDC's leading causes of death: [https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm)\n\nNote that more than 1.2 million people die every year in the US alone from heart disease and cancer combined. 1.2 million people per year is about \\~3200 people per day, on average. I'm rounding down to simplify numbers.\n\nAbout 250,000 people die every year from some type of infectious disease, including the flu (about 55,000 die from the flu alone).\n\nNow, let's do some more reality checks. [The age-adjusted death rate for the entire population is about 1.1%](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db355.htm#section_2). In other words, about 1.1% of all people will die every year. That's about \\~700 people per 100,000 every year. Age is the biggest factor in death, but some things will increase your likelihood of death such as taking risks, driving fast, being in a car, using excessive drugs, etc.\n\n[How you're getting died](https://preview.redd.it/qh9trcamacl41.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da0fa2631dccf79b0c4748d189491ba63d377815)\n\nIf you break it out by age, you'll notice that death rates go much higher with increased age. For 85 and over, the death rate is 13%. For 75-84, the death rate is about 4.4%. For 65-74, it's 1.78%.\n\n[Old people die because they're old](https://preview.redd.it/il1zes0kacl41.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc435bbb1828e86c6e11250af60a63f0ae5c17c3)\n\nOkay, so wtf does this have to do with coronavirus? Old people are probably going to die anyway, especially as they get older. Coronavirus mostly kills old people, but speaking in terms of probabilities, they're probably going to die soon anyway. If the corona don't kill 'em, [falling down the stairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falling_(accident)), heart disease, or cancer most likely will.\n\n[You best hope you ain't old](https://preview.redd.it/f0u9fbaobcl41.png?width=1452&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a710d9b2787cc09ecf34d1ea35550cb1b2ed26b)\n\n[Here's some data on coronavirus deaths by age](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-age-sex-demographics/), and you'll notice it matches up closely with the CDC numbers for death in general. This is what we'd expect, and it's pretty normal. death rates might be slightly higher, but it's not significant enough to matter in any real way.\n\nWe still don't have enough data yet, and there are probably many undocumented cases of infection. The cases we know about are generally from people who get very sick and seek treatment. Healthy young people will probably get the virus and hardly even notice. Those who seek treatment are more likely to get died, which skews the death rates higher than they really are.\n\ntl;dr: buy puts now because stocks will go down, but maybe also buy calls 6-12 months out because stocks will go up once the fake news media stops capitalizing on the global retard pandemic.
