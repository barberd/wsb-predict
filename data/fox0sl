I thought they sold milk bags to high schools at first but that\u2019s something else.\n\nThey are one of the most indebted companies in America. Some smart retard told me this is bad. They also conduct a large portion of business overseas. Overseas also fucked. They have a bond/debt payment May 15th. \n\nAlso- which companies haven\u2019t been up 1000% in the last few days? Almost all of them. Except Cisco. If that doesn\u2019t show how big of a piece of shit they are then idk. The IV on puts is at like 60% right now which is some of the lowest I\u2019ve seen. Pretty nice? Yes.\n\nNow- I\u2019ve blown up my account to 10K twice but lost it all twice and you know what they say.... 3rd times the charm baby.\n\nCSCO 38.5P 4/17 but I would go Mid May if I could afford it.", "created_utc": 1585166313.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fox0sl/short_shitty_company/", "is_self": true}
