I have been trading stocks for 10 years, always playing the long game, done very well, made about 70 grand off of 20-25 over the years, paid off my house back in February thanks to Canopy Growth. But i see all you guys WINNING SO HARD &amp; (mostly) losing (mostly, shhhhh) your asses, but maybe I can be a winner to?\n\nSo I enabled options trading on Robinhood. \n\nBut first, they had to ask me a few questions for my own safety:\n\n1. How long have you traded options? Me : 0 years\n2. Are you a regulator (whatever the fuck this means) : No\n3. Do you have a heartbeat? : Yes\n\nCongratulations! Here's a bunch of credit to ruin your life! \n\nlmao no shit people are killing themselves every day.\n\nFYI, I'm not jumping in, my portfolio is autistic enough.", "created_utc": 1559132670, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bue0el/its_easy_to_see_why_robinhood_has_ruined_so_many/", "is_self": true}
