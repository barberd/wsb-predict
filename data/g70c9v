{"id": "g70c9v", "title": "A little helpful advice", "selftext": "Show of hands, who here knows how to create a synthetic stock position? First, find a stock you\u2019d be happy to own 100 shares of at the current price, preferably on a day the stock is dropping in value. Next, pick an expiration for how far out you want to go. It doesn\u2019t really matter how far out you go. What you\u2019re looking for is that the ATM call premium and the ATM put premium are close to equal. \n\nHow about an example? Last month I did this with Wendy\u2019s. At the time, the stock was trading for $11, so I sold the $11 august put and bought the $11 august call. I paid .03 for this. Effectively, I bought 100 shares at $11, except my broker only required me to give them $3. This morning I sold off my call for $800, and I\u2019m keeping the short put till it expires worthless in august. I did the same thing with CAKE today. I sold the $17.5 put for January and bought the $17.5 call for January at a premium of $1.83. \n\nThis strategy is used to gain leverage. If you\u2019d like income as well, you can sell calls against your position. We call this the poor man\u2019s covered call. Because your broker only requires you to have 20% of the cash to cover, the return on capital is substantially better. Now you\u2019re probably wondering how much your broker charges you to lend the money for this position. That would be zero. Unless the short put you sold is exercised, your leverage is free. Happy trading everyone.", "created_utc": 1587695750.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g70c9v/a_little_helpful_advice/", "is_self": true}
