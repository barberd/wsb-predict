{"id": "fx6b0t", "title": "$PLAYTime's Over: Fuzzy Does D&B", "selftext": "Hello, dumdums -\n\nIt's me, Fuzzy. Welcome to a bright new day.\n\nI hope you all had a productive start to the week, alternating between crying yourself to sleep / awake, relentlessly beating your meat and waiting for the markets to open. As promised on [Friday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fu7dmg/everything_you_always_wanted_to_know_about_swaps/), today in the neighborhood we're going to be working through a full breakdown of everybody's favorite low-rent purveyor of curly fries, pinball and sticky-carpeted sadness - Dave & Busters ($PLAY), as suggested by u/leonardnimoyNC1701. Sadly, the question of whether he's a $PLAY bagholder or just a big fan of Street Fighter 2 and shitty beer remains unanswered. Anyway, let's do this.\n\nA couple of reminders for the first time readers and slow learners in the audience (which I imagine applies to most, if not all of you):\n\n1. I will answer any legitimate question I get asked about the post, no matter how stupid (as long as it is sincere or at least funny). Sometimes it takes me a couple of days but I get around to everybody eventually. I do this because getting flamed by someone who knows what they're talking about is the only way to learn - it's how I learned, and it works. **But remember - I don't give advice for free**. So please don't ask me what to buy (long $ONIONS), if your 95% OTM option is fucked (almost certainly, unless you're long $BA) or for a strike/exp ($SPY 69p 4/20 blaze it) because I'll just have to repeat that in the comments and you'll look like a big dummy.\n2. The fact that I am posting this is not indicative of any view I have on D&B one way or the other; this was just the most upvoted ticker in Friday's post. I do this shit because (i) I enjoy it and (ii) I want you retards to learn how to do your own legwork.\n3. Most upvoted ticker / financial concept in the comments will get the next breakdown. This will likely be market open Monday **next week** as I have some more basic financial literacy I'd like to ram down your throats before then.\n4. Finally, and perhaps most importantly - u/pokimane. Girl, WSB is getting a little crazy. Why don't you and me get out of here; my offer to tell you which stonks to buy remains open (as do my DMs).\n\nOK - on with the show. This is actually a pretty interesting case study; D&B have in the last month (i) successfully warded off some adverse interest from KKR  (ii) closed all their locations (iii) lost 90% of their equity value and (iv) against all odds, smashed earnings. Plus, like many of you bagholding autists, as a result of the current market they've also had to open themselves up to taking some deep PIPE - although in their case, that stands for a Public Investment in Private Equity (rather than the more... literal version of 'pipe' that ends with you, your desperation finance OnlyFans channel, and that one 'won't take no for an answer' subscriber named Chuck). Don't worry; I'll explain all of this as we go along (other than the Chuck thing).\n\n**TL;DR**? Fuck you. This will take you 10 minutes at most to work through and you'll learn something.\n\nOkay. Ready? Let's do this.\n\n**1.Things You'll Need To Play Along At Home**\n\n[D&B Credit Agreement](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1525769/000114420417044736/v473864_ex10-1.htm)\n\n[D&B 10-K](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1525769/000119312520098060/d832311d10k.htm)\n\n[Some music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLTm5NlcgOw)\n\nA drink (at this time in the morning, it may be some coffee; that said, Fuzzy don't judge).\n\n**2. High Score? D&B Target Review**\n\nAs always, it's important to understand the entity you're considering when you're doing a breakdown like  this. So, D&B run all-in-one restaurants / bars / arcades; they've got 136 locations in 39 states. That's it. Not exactly a diversified business model, but hey, whatever works. The revenue breakdown is like this:\n\n* Food - 28% of revenue OKAY\n* Booze - 13% of revenue WOULD HAVE THOUGHT BOOZE WOULD MAKE UP MORE AS IT'S TYPICALLY A HIGHER MARGIN IN HOSPO BUSINESSES\n* Arcade games - **58% of revenue**.  HOLY SHIT, THAT'S A LOT OF PINBALL. THE SPLIT HERE IS 72% TICKET GAMES ('REDEMPTION GAMES - THOSE PLAY TO WIN TICKETS THINGS LIKE WHACK-A-MOLE), 27% NON-REDEMPTION GAMES (VR, SHOOTERS, ETC) AND 1% BILLIARDS AND BOWLING. THIS IS ACTUALLY A PRETTY GOOD SPLIT AS THE REDEMPTION GAMES ARE A CIRCULAR ECONOMY - THE PRIZES YOU WIN ARE BOUGHT BY D&B WHOLESALE AND PRICED THROUGH THE ROOF I.E. THE TOTAL REDEMPTION VALUE OF TICKETS WON FAR EXCEEDS THE RETAIL PRICE OF THE ITEM YOU'RE PAYING THEM FOR.\n\nOK. So the takeaway here is that no money is coming in other than in the pockets of people who walk through the front doors of each store. Before we dive into this, let's look at why they had an earnings pop (reporting Q4 and FY 2019, **not** Q1 2020):\n\n* Total revenues increased 7.1% to $1.355 bn from $1.265 THAT'S A GOOD YEAR\n* Number of stores increased 12.4% to 136 from 121 AGGRESSIVE EXPANSION MEANS A LOT OF POTENTIALLY WEAK / CASHFLOW NEGATIVE OR NEUTRAL LOCATIONS\n* Comparable store sales decreased 2.6% OKAY. THESE GUYS ARE PROBABLY THE DOMINANT PLAYER IN THEIR CATEGORY ANYWAY.\n* Net FY 2019 income totaled $100.3 m, or $2.94 per diluted share (they have 34.1 million shares outstanding), vs. net FY 2018 income of $117.2 million, or $2.93 per diluted share (40.0 million shares outstanding) OKAY\n* EBITDA increased less than 1% to $280.5 million from $279.3 million LIKE I'VE EXPLAINED BEFORE, EBITDA IS NOT ACTUALLY A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF COMPANY FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE BECAUSE OF THE WAY IN WHICH THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AND/OR COMPANY ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND FINANCIALs PERMIT IT TO BE CALCULATED. HERE, THEY TOOK (AMONG OTHER THINGS) A $7M WRITEDOWN IN EXECUTIVE STOCK OPTIONS AND A $1.183M WRITEDOWN IN ASSET DISPOSAL (EVEN THOUGH THEY ONLY CLOSED ONE LOCATION IN FY2019), AND A $20M WRITEDOWN FOR 'OTHER COSTS'. RIIIGHT.\n\nSo what we can see here is a business operating an aggressive expansion strategy that leases almost all of its locations and is operating on a pretty thin margin. Good earnings caused a pop on the equity price but that was for a non-corona quarter and they'd already lost 90% of the value of the shares. I wonder what effect the ol' bat flu is going to have on their business? Well, we already know they laid off 90% of their employees - let's see what else they've got planned:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"We cannot predict how soon we will be able to reopen our stores and, as, our ability to reopen will depend in part on the actions of a number of governmental bodies over which we have no control. Moreover, once restrictions are lifted, it is unclear how quickly customers will return to our stores, which may be a function of continued concerns over safety and/or depressed consumer sentiment due to adverse economic conditions, including job losses. Considering the significant uncertainty as to when we can reopen some or all of our stores and the uncertain customer demand environment, in addition to the actions described above, we:  \n>  \n>\u2022have begun discussions with our landlords, vendors, and other business partners to reduce our lease and contract payments and obtain other concessions;  \n>  \n>\u2022are in discussion with our lenders to obtain covenant relief to avoid events of default; and  \n>  \n>\u2022are in active dialogue with multiple potential investors to secure additional sources of financing.\"\n\nSounds super healthy.\n\n**Teaching moment**. Here's a really important part  that would be easy to skip over. Like I've explained before, when you sign up to a Credit Agreement, it comes with a lot of rules. You have to do certain things at certain times in order to keep your banks happy. If you break them, bad things happen. So when you know you're not going to be able to comply, you need to get a waiver. Anyway, one of those rules is delivering them a set of audited financials every year. Seems like D&B had a preliminary conversation with their auditors that... did not go well. How can we tell? Well, in February they sought a waiver of the obligation to deliver these financials to their lenders this year. Why would they do that? The auditor's main job is to tell you that the business is capable of operating as a 'going concern'; i.e., that everything is in order and they're not about to go under. So D&B wrote to their banks and asked... not to send this. They spell it out for you in the 10-K:\n\n>While our lenders have granted a waiver of any event of default associated with receiving an auditor\u2019s report \\*\\*indicating a substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern\\*\\* in connection with our year-end audit,\n\nThey go on to talk about how if they didn't get a waiver they would have had to file for Chapter 11. Now, they did get a waiver, so Ch. 11 isn't incoming, but it's important info to realize how precarious the situation of this business is. They have **$99,000,000** cash on hand, no revenue, continuing lease expenditures, and about $750 million debt exposure. That's..... bad. They also are getting clipped about $5.5 million a quarter on interest payments.\n\n**3. What's One More Quarter? A D&B Debt Breakdown**\n\nD&B actually have a pretty basic debt structure. They currently have $266.5m outstanding under the TL (10-k, cross-ref the definition of \"Term Loan Commitments\") and the full $500m drawn under the revolver (8-k in March, cross-ref \"Revolving Credit Commitments\"). As of Feb the spread on the loans was L+150 (10-K) but the full draw on the revolver will have pushed their latest borrowings to L+200 as they've now exceeded their leverage step-downs ratios (see the definition of \"Applicable Margin\" in the Credit Agreement, cross ref definition of \"Total Leverage Ratio\"). You can calculate total leverage for $PLAY like this: **Total funded debt** *minus* **cash** *divided by* **EBITDA** (see definition of \"Total Leverage Ratio\").\n\nThe facility is maturing in Feb 2022; so they've got 18 months to pull together nearly $800 million in interest and repayments. Hmm. Sounds like they'll be needing some cash soon. Well, we know they've tapped out their revolver; so that's gone (and they couldn't draw that to repay the TL anyway as they mature at the same time plus there are restrictions on use of proceeds in the Credit Agreement for things like this). The big question here is what kind of additional debt they can incur under the facility.\n\nAs we discussed in our $SEAS and $F breakdowns, credit agreements permit you to go out and incur additional debt only under certain circumstances, using dedicated 'baskets' found in the negative covenants of the document. Normally these have their own dedicated section but this CA has a bit of a weird structure so they're lumped in with all the other covenants. You can find them in Section 8.07 (**Borrowings**).\n\nThe key baskets we're looking for come in three categories: (i) incremental debt (debt that can be incurred \\*outside\\* of the facility (ii) general basket debt (this is known as a 'freebie' or 'dollar' basket and is just straight up debt they can incur without getting permission from the banks (iii) ratio debt (debt they can incur when they are in compliance with a certain leverage ratio). Let's work through them one by one.\n\n**Incremental Debt** \\- Let's go to Section 1.16. You can see here that they can incur \"New Term Loans\" (incremental debt) in an amount up to $\\*\\*150m + as much as they want provided they're in in compliance with a secured leverage ratio of 2.50:1.00\\*\\*. They've blown through this so we can safely say this debt incurrence is capped at $150m. There are a couple of other random more technical builders related to cash-flow sweeps and declined proceeds which I won't go into, but I'm listing them here to be complete.\n\n**General Basket** \\- Back to Section 8. See if you can spot the general basket. It's in (k). The cap here is the greater of (i) $20 million and (ii) 10% of the EBITDA. 10% of EBITDA is bigger here, so it's about $28 million.\n\n**Ratio Basket** \\- Unlimited capacity subject to Total Leverage Ratio compliance of 3.50:1.00. They're justttttt in compliance with this so they can tap some of this basket if they wanted to. This is in section 8.07(n).\n\nThey're also dealing with a 'financial covenant' that requires them to be in compliance with a Total Leverage Ratio of 3.50:1.00 and a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 1.25:1.00. They are 99% likely to seek relief from these covenants even though they're currently in compliance (because their EBITDA is going to fall dramatically) and they indicate in the 10-K they're already exploring this.\n\n**4. $PLAY Wants The $PIPE**\n\nSo we can see that $PLAY is limited in terms of its debt flexibility and they're going to need some more money to keep going. Now, earlier in the month they resisted some adverse interest from private equity buyers by adopting  [a new shareholder rights plan](https://www.marketscreener.com/DAVE-BUSTER-S-ENTERTAIN-11659849/news/DAVE-BUSTER-S-ENTERTAINMENT-INC-ADOPTS-LIMITED-DURATION-SHAREHOLDER-RIGHTS-PLAN-30189266/) commonly known as a 'poison pill') which attempts to limit the amount of shares that can be owned by a single buyer by forcing them to pay double the market price once they reach a certain ownership threshold (here, it's 15%). This forces anyone who wants to deal with a potential $PLAY acquisition to play nice with the board rather than just try and buy up common at the discount corona-prices. Think about it like the fat friend at the bar. It's there to prevent the cute, distressed opportunity from getting into more trouble than it should. Even though $PLAY wants more cash, it wants to get it on its own terms.\n\nBut now, $PLAY's sobered up, and, with the security blanket plan in place - surprise - they've dolled themselves up, put on their cutest outfit, and they're out trawling for investments. What they're exploring is referred to as a PIPE - public investment in private equity. This is a pretty ballsy move and its often referred to as financing of last resort because it's risky and expensive; it involves $PLAY putting together a block of preferred equity priced substantially below par, couple it with warrants or other securities, and then sell it to a single investor. This puts them in bed with that investor for a while and pisses off the common stock holders, **but** can have the effect of driving up price of common due to renewed interest in the long term prospects of the business (plus provides the obvious benefit of a short term cashflow injection).\n\nThe reason that PIPEs can provide a short term boost is because the unregistered pref shares are relatively illiquid - once the investor buys them, they're hard to trade for a little while. This indicates that (i) smart money sees a bottom in the price of the common and (ii) believes that there's long term value in the asset. This is going to be a pretty popular form of financing for the next few months given the number of distressed entities who will have difficulty refinancing their debt without exorbitant rates.\n\nThat said, the issue of involving yourself with PE investors who will want a say in the operation of the business is substantially different than involving yourself with hands off bankers just looking for long term returns. It's like [taking Greek government bonds as collateral](https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-ecb-greece/update-1-greeces-borrowing-costs-fall-after-inclusion-in-ecbs-package-idUSL8N2BC3VA) (lol) - it's a risky business.\n\nUse your noodle and consider all your options given the above information. Good luck out there.\n\nFinal note - it's a brave new world of WSB.
