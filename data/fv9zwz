{"id": "fv9zwz", "title": "The Case for Long Term Bear (Part 2 of the liquidity to solvency conversation)", "selftext": " Hey. Last week I wrote a post about the transition from liquidity to solvency crisis that got a lot of interest here. In that post, I predicted that volatility will fall even as stock price falls in a slow burn down. I recommended staying away from short term, deep OTM puts.\n\nAll of that has come true this week. It\u2019s crazy that so many on WSB attribute this week to some kind of conspiracy theory, big brother manipulation, when in fact the slow burn second leg down is literally the playbook across market crashes: DOW in 1929, Nikkei in 1991, KOSPI during the Asian Financial Crisis, etc. You can find the post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqol7h/from_liquidity_to_solvency_crisis_why_wsb_is/).\n\nAnyway. To the main point of this post. We established that markets will fall in a slow burn down. But how far will it fall? Let\u2019s figure it out: the case for long term bear. To start, we ask the question: how should businesses be valued?\n\nWell, at it's core, businesses should be valued based on the long-term profit they produce. The more long-term profits businesses produce, the more they should be valued. All agreed?\n\nOkay, now we established that. Let\u2019s look at how they did. It turns out that from 2012-2019, the AGGREGATE PROFIT of all US businesses did not grow. At All. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/umml1s8vcyq41.png?width=1459&format=png&auto=webp&s=02000e13e257d5b64055e9ee2365dcd5f804c8b9\n\nThis is very important so let that sink in for a minute.\n\nFor the past 7 years, while we\u2019re booming away, businesses in aggregate were not doing the ONLY THING that should make them more valuable in the long run.\n\nYET, the aggregate US stock market more than DOUBLED during that same period. This should make no sense. Right? What the hell is this? Well, it\u2019s two things: share buyback and multiples expansion. Let me explain with a simple, fictional company called BS corp.\n\nSuppose BS Corp (BSC for short) produces $100 of total profit a year. It has 4 shares, so each shareholder receives $25 of earnings. Now suppose it has a P/E of 10x. Each share is worth $25\\* 10x, or $250. Simple right?\n\nNow suppose BSC decides to buy back two shares by issuing cheap debt. Interest on these debt costs $10 so now the BSC has $90 of profit, and only 2 shares. Now each share receives 90/2, or $45 of earnings per share. Wow! If it continues to have a P/E of 10x, each share is now worth $450.\n\nThis is share buyback. And if it looks like financial wizardry to you, trust me, it\u2019s not. In finance speak, companies are adding financial leverage to juice up their equity returns. They jack up their EPS by reducing the number of outstanding shares and augmenting their capital structures with cheap debt. But this makes them much more vulnerable to any external shock (since they\u2019re more leveraged). Does a virus count as an external shock?\n\nBut hold on, we\u2019re not done yet. Suppose astute investors see that BSC suddenly went from $25 of EPS to $45. WOW! That\u2019s a growth stock! So now, instead of assigning a P/E of 10x, they give it a P/E of 15x. Times are good, things are growing, right? Suddenly, BSC is worth $45 \\* 15x, or $675 per share. Even though it still makes the same profit, BSC is now valued at 2x+. This is multiples expansion.\n\nBSC is Corporate America in aggregate over the past 7 years. Even though aggregate profit hasn\u2019t budged, multiples is much higher and corporate debt is the highest it\u2019s ever been. Between those two sleights of hand, stock prices went off the charts.\n\nWhat did that mean for investors during that time? Well, it\u2019s hard. Because while the music kept playing, investors had to dance. Sitting on cash over those years would not have been smart. Even if you knew it was all just a house of cards waiting for a gust of wind. Or a virus.\n\nHow long does it take? Well I\u2019m no TA master with an astrologer\u2019s chart, but I look at history. History points to slow burn down with multiple cycles of bear rallies. At least a year to a year and a half. So no, your 180 4/17 SPY put will not print unless we get another liquidity crunch.\n\nTL; DR: bears, be short term conservative and long term greedy.
