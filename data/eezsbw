{"id": "eezsbw", "title": "health of the stock market is strong", "selftext": "I've been doing some analysis of the stock markets around the world along with the S&amp;P 500 breadth.  Basically everything is going up.  That is quite bullish because the US stock market cannot rally just on its own.  It needs some participation from other stock markets.  Also, the RSP (the equal weighted S&amp;P 500 etf) is doing very well.  There will be a time when the stock market becomes bearish again.  That will be when interest rates spike up and only the QQQs are doing well.  That's not even close to being the case yet.\n\n  \nI'm still invested in NFLX, PFE, and USO.  I see no reason to sell.  Not even close to sell signals on the charts.  However, I do see rate sensitive stocks being laggards because I think rates will rise.", "created_utc": 1577183866, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eezsbw/health_of_the_stock_market_is_strong/", "is_self": true}
