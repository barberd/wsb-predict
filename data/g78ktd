This comes comes right along with NFL draft and Corona restrictions starting to ease some.  Remember how much the portnoy gamble stock jumped?  DKNG is already up.... Just imagine what's gonna happen when all the frat bros realize they can invest in Draft Kings.  \n\nTicker just changed today.  Not even CNBC realized DEAC = DK. Now the flood gates should open.  DK is worth more than where it is right now. No doubt. \n\nI can already see the \"invested in draft kings!\" Twitter posts. Draft Kings is crazy popular among 20 something males.  Which also happens to be the demographic that have suddenly become \"traders\" during quarantine.  This is about to jump. \n\nDKNG 8/21 25", "created_utc": 1587735711.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g78ktd/ladies_and_gentlemen_it_has_happened_deac_is/", "is_self": true}
