Each option represents 100 shares. Why pay for 10,000 shares when you could buy 100 options contracts at 10 bucks each? \n\nAll you need to do is buy and sell (for more money) before the expiration date-easy. If you have less than 25k in your account (this will be most of you), then you can only make so many day trades before Robinhood bans you. The way around this is to sell an option one strike above your option to lock in your gains. \n\nThere are two types of options - calls (the stock goes up), and puts (the stock goes down - it usually doesn\u2019t). If the stock goes up, you make money, especially during earnings. The volatility that occurs during earnings makes options really expensive - which is good for you as you can sell it for more.\n\nFutures:\n\nThe movement of futures will be important to you depending on if you hold calls or puts (hopefully you didn\u2019t buy puts on SPY- this one always goes up). For example, if the futures are red and you hold calls, you\u2019ll probably make money the next day, and vice versa.  \n\nYou will want to always keep an eye on the futures-consider getting a tablet and constantly checking to see what /ES is currently trading at, then post about it in daily discussion so people on Robinhood know if it is mooning or drilling\n\nTerminology \n\nTA - Technical Analysis/colored lines/indicators. This is basically astrology for grown men, most don\u2019t use this here.\n\nFD - A type of option that can make enormous amounts of money in a single day. These will probably be regulated soon.\n\nMooning - a stock, future, option has increased in value by at least .2%. Drilling is the opposite\n\nBulls - People who think stocks will go up\n\nTheta Gang - People who sell you options, they are the equivalent of a downtown (not strip) Vegas casino \n\nBears - People who are gay \n\nThis post is not intended to provide financial advice and is only to be used as a guide for navigating WSB", "created_utc": 1580966561, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eznfy2/options_and_you_a_guide_for_new_rall_people/", "is_self": true}
