My list of Positives and Negatives.\n\nPositives **+**\n\n* Production is supposed to increase from 2000kg to over 81,000kg by December 31st.\n* Planted 158 acres hemp which will add revenue for Q3/4\n* Company will be 4th largest cannabis producer at full capacity with 219,000kg\n* Some market contributors believe they are undervalued\n* CEO recently said this increase will make TGOD cash flow positive in Q1 2020\n* Cash on hand is 224M v. 14M burn rate\n* Major summer hiring at greenhouse sites in anticipation of production cycle\n*  In a [recent interview](https://www.ftmig.com/portfolio-view/ftmig-explorsive-brian-athaide-ceo-shawn-bovingdon-cfo-of-the-green-organic-dutchman-tgod/) , CFO Shawn Bovingdon said that as soon as they start expanding their  revenue, uplisting would be a natural step they will look to take.  \n\n   * Uplifted stocks in 2019 have gained [over 150%](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4253790-first-quarter-2019-uplisted-stocks-gained-173-percent-6-months-prior-uplisting) in the six months prior to uplisting.
