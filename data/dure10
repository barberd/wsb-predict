{"id": "dure10", "title": "GLARING ISSUE: TD Ameritrade Has Their Own Version of Unlimited Leverage", "selftext": "   A little known bug found in the TD Ameritrade software is the inability for weekend deposits to be assigned a fixed monetary value. This can be exploited if a deposit is made during the weekend in which the TD software registers the deposit, but does not have a definite value to assign to the deposit. This allows the user to place apparently endless trades in terms of value. Any value that exceeds the deposit once it is cleared is simply stated as negative buying power and it is assumed that the account owner will settle this margin (potential debt) by the end of the trading day to avoid a margin call. This can be exploited for regular common stock as well as forex positions as of what has been seen so far.  Is this the next big blow up and story to be headlined all around the financial world?", "created_utc": 1573473314, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dure10/glaring_issue_td_ameritrade_has_their_own_version/", "is_self": true}
