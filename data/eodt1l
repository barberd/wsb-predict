{"id": "eodt1l", "title": "I hate CNBC honestly. I think the unusual options activity segment is specious at best, duplicitous are worst. I think Pete and John Najarian are intentionally misleading people on TV.", "selftext": "For context sake: I\u2019m a 25 year old one-year-out-of-college real estate financial analyst. I have a boomer in my office who\u2019s in his mid 50s. He always invested in super safe mutual funds forever until I taught him about options in September. He\u2019s up from 36k to $45k. \n\nAnyways, he religiously watches Cramer, CNBC, and the Najarian brothers religiously. From what I gather from what he tells me, these guys are running a fucking scam and it pisses me off. He thinks they are honest and it\u2019s his fault, and no doubt he bears personal responsibility for making trades. The options he does DD on and trades almost always do well. Every time he tells me about Pete and John\u2019s unusual call option activity it ALWAYS ranks. He\u2019ll do the same exact position that is highlighted as unusual option activity. This time it was exact sciences. I guess it was on Thursday night\u2019s episode bc he bought the call Friday. Well today it\u2019s down 15 fucking percent. Every time they suggest one of these unusual options activity and he tells me about it, it\u2019s always a loser. \n\nI think these guys are highlighting these options and then literally take the other side of the trade. Maybe I\u2019m wrong, I don\u2019t watch CNBC. I just think these guys are scamming old boomers into following unusual options activity and then selling them the calls or buying puts. \n\nIf I\u2019m wrong feel free to correct me. If you guys actually make money on this, then maybe he\u2019s just unlucky.", "created_utc": 1578964519, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eodt1l/i_hate_cnbc_honestly_i_think_the_unusual_options/", "is_self": true}
