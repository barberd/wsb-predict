I had 10 contracts of AMD at 48.00 well they were pretty much loss. Had 10 for Facebook at 210 expiring the 10th . I sold it all  looking back I shoulda held Facebook but with this fucker being so erratic I didn\u2019t know what to do. Long story short my instinct went to shit and I started doing puts when I shoulda done calls and vice versa. I\u2019m now holding FDs for 47.50 put for WFC and a 57 call for AMD, all valued at $217.
