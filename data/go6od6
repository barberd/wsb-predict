{"id": "go6od6", "title": "EVRI Earnings Play", "selftext": "Good Afternoon Retards and Faggots alike.\n\nThis is my second earnings play (1st was JD.com, which went well, but first is always free.)\n\nEVRI Reports earnings June 2nd AMC (After Market Close), with an expected EPS of (.03) and Revenue 140.08M.\n\nEveri develops, sells, and leases games and gaming machines, gaming systems and services\n\nEveri Holdings reports its results of operations within two operating segments: Games and FinTech.\n\nEveri Games provides gaming operators with gaming technology products and services, including: (a) gaming machines, primarily comprising Class II and Class III slot machines, including TournEvent\u00ae machines, placed under participation or fixed-fee lease arrangements or sold to casino customers; (b) TournEvent\u00ae system software, licenses, and ancillary equipment;(c) providing and maintaining the central determinant systems for the video lottery terminals (\u201cVLTs\u201d) installed in the State of New York and similar technology in certain tribal jurisdictions; (d) business-to-consumer (\u201cB2C\u201d) and business-to-business (\u201cB2B\u201d) interactive gaming activities; and (e) managing our TournEvent of Champions\u00ae national slot tournament.\n\nEveri FinTech provides gaming operators with financial technology products and services, including: (a) services and equipment that facilitate casino patron\u2019s self-service access to cash at gaming facilities via Automated Teller Machine (\u201cATM\u201d) cash withdrawals, credit card cash access transactions and point-of-sale (\u201cPOS\u201d) debit card purchase and cash access transactions; (b) check warranty services; (c) self-service player loyalty enrollment and marketing equipment, including tools and promotion management software; (d) software and services that improve credit decision making, automate cashier operations, and enhance patron marketing activities for gaming establishments; (e) equipment that provides cash access and other cash handling efficiency-related services; and (f) compliance, audit, and data solutions.\n\nEssentially, Games handles the actual machines, while their FinTech deals mostly with cash related transactions. \n\"ATM cash withdrawal transactions represent the largest category of electronic payment transactions that we process, as measured by dollars processed and transaction volume.\"\n\nNow some numbers: \n\n2018 vs 2017 Revenue:\n469M vs 410M (Growth of 14%)\n\n2018 vs 2017 Expenses:\n383M vs 328M (Increase of 20%)\n\n2019 vs 2018 Revenue \n533M vs 469M (Growth of 14%)\n\n2019 vs 2018 Expenses\n439M vs 383M (Increase of 14%)\n\nSo Revenue has gone up by 14% each of the last 2 years, while expenses has dropped from 20% to 14% - Good sign.\n\nTheir Net Cash Available has actually doubled from 81M to 160M from 2018 to 2019. \n\nAs we all know, Casinos have been closed with COVID, however you are starting to see them opening up in Oklahoma (one of their largest operating grounds), and Vegas, while not confirmed, have started seeing Casinos take reservations for arrival end of May and Beginning of June. \n\nThis boasts well for their earnings call on June 2nd. We also know numbers don't mean everything in this market. The outlook is the most important. While I cant foreshadow how their earnings will look, their outlook going forward should be good. Gambling addicts dont quit gambling. We will see people running to Casinos again, and this is good news for Evri with their equipment and ATM transaction fees.\n\nThe stock has already climbed to $5.57 as of writing this, a 33% increase in the last week, but this could easily climb back to pre covid levels of above $10 by EOY. \n\nOptions are really cheap too, with a 6/19 7.5C sitting at $.33 at market close today. IV is high at 139%, so beware there, but this can still climb.\n\nTL;DR:\nEVRI has a good chance to climb post earnings given the outlook they can submit with casinos reopening. Earnings could look bad, but outlook > numbers right now\n\nPositions: 100 Shares at 4.30 Cost Basis \n6/19 7.5C\n\nEdit: Not related, but I will be researching CHWY as well in the coming days and posting that as they report earnings the following week (I am bullish on them)", "created_utc": 1590099704.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/go6od6/evri_earnings_play/", "is_self": true}
