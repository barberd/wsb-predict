A break above means we see 290. However a break down would possibly go for a 264 test. Just something to look at. I\u2019ll be looking at 285P for May 15 if SPY cannot get above this level. \n\nHere is the Chart: [SPY](https://imgur.com/a/Buk1Z1g)\n\nI normally do not trade SPY, I\u2019m an AMZN day trader. But this is looking super primed for some cash.
