China is where Corona was born. 8 is the most lucky number in China. Therefore 888 is triple as lucky and foretells triple digit gains in the S&amp;P on Monday. However if we see any more beer virus in Italy taking us above our feng shui number of cases this TA is null and void and you autists can't blame my prediction not being true. If we hit 6,666 cases in Italy we will probably see -6,666 points on the Dow as 6 is a very unlucky number in China.\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ywz3l3qtjpj41.png?width=703&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06c237ef403e97de95bec6c53564c7658b9951de\n\nTLDR: My magic number TA is just as likelyas the bs coming out of CNBC all day long.", "created_utc": 1582914505, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/faz6we/the_market_will_go_up_as_italy_has_hit_the_lucky/", "is_self": true}
