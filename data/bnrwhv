{"id": "bnrwhv", "title": "Tendie kisses 1", "selftext": "This week, someone on this sub got sand in his vagina over a shitpost I made and challenged me to post some real DD. So here it is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI may do these every Sunday, or this may be the first and last.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't fuck with options like some of you retards, just stocks for now. I'm also not autistic enough to day trade. I have a real job and social obligations (in case you're wondering, cry-shouting at your mum because she hasn't cleaned your CPAP machine doesn't count as socialising). So I stick to stocks and typically pick some on Sunday then close positions throughout the following week or the one after.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI usually focus on companies with market caps between 100M and 1 Bn, because they're more interesting and often volatile. I'm also bored of the same old $AAPL, $SNAP, $LYFT, $BABA, $MSFT ad nauseum circle-jerk. I like penny stocks if they poke their heads into dollar territory and I can see a good opportunity to brown bear dick them back down into oblivion. bear gang for life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, without further ado - here are my top 3 picks for the coming week, complete with big swinging DDs:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**$WKHS (BEAR - short term)**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI posted about this [earlier in the week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bmcyww/wkhs_penny_stock_up_200_today_because_of_a_trump/) and was completely ignored. Really hurt my feelings you guys, but because I love you i'm going to give you all a second run at the tendies. TL;DR is that this week Trump tweeted about Workhorse buying a vacant plant from $GM in Ohio, which pushed their stock price out of the pennies and over $2 in a few hours, based on absolutely nothing. From what I can see, Workhorse are a failing electric truck manufacturer trying to dig themselves out of a money hole by borrowing even more money and spending it stupidly. Trump made a big deal about the sale because it's Ohio and he wants to take credit for every job created there. Turns out the United Auto Workers (UAW) don't want the deal to go through and GM are contractually prohibited from closing or selling the plant until its current labour deal with the UAW expires in September. Plus Workhorse might not even have the money to buy the plant. All in all, a bunch of all caps hot air from Teflon Don. BUT... you didn't miss out on all the tendies. At $1.82 $WKHS is still an overweight date and dying for a dicking back into the pennies. I'm expecting a sharp sell off on Monday and will hopefully be closing by Tuesday or Wednesday, depending on how big a train the markets run on her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1 caveat:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWorkhorse are currently through to the final stage of a USPS competition to replace their old fleet of postal delivery vehicles. The winner should be announced very soon (maybe as soon as this week, since it's been delayed since 2018). If Workhorse win the contract, it'll be worth $6 Bn+ and absolutely rape my position. Competition is stiff, but I'm discounting everyone except for AM General and Workhorse. AM General are my favourites because they have the relationship with the federal government and the capacity / expertise to get the job done. Except for Workhorse and Oshkosh/Ford, all other competitors are foreign (Indian and Turkish). No way Teflon Don is giving this business to ~~ragheads~~ a non-US company this close to an election (MAGA). I'm discounting Ford because their design looks like dog shit and the proposed plant isn't in a swing state. As I said above, Workhorse are in Ohio. AM General are in Southbend, Indiana, another swing state. So, to my mind, Trump's **rational** play is to push USPS to give the deal to AM General and please Indiana state voters. Come September, he can still push GM to sell to Workhorse in Ohio to try and pick up votes there but by then i'll be on a boat in the Caribbean doing ketamine off midgets' painted feet so it's no skin of my perfectly smooth sack.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**$VCEL (BULL - mid-term)**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVericel are a biopharm company specialising in therapies that aid tissue and organ repair. It's actually some pretty cool steam-punk tech that wouldn't be out of place in an Alien film or Demolition Man. Cell therapy to repair joints, biological skin graft and meshes to regrow organic tissue...it's cool. Most recently, this month they signed an exclusive deal with MediWound ($MDWD) to license and sell a burn gel (NexoBrid) in North America. The gel uses enzymes to remove burned tissue - in a phase II clinical trial, 93% of subjects experiencing complete removal of the damaged tissue. Great stuff. The deal with MediWound is performanced-based, so if the gel doesn't sell, VCEL won't be crippled by payments. Here's the really good bit: in Europe, you can't use this gel outside of specialist burn centres because it's too advanced for peasant use, but you yanks have a pretty lackadaisical approach to healthcare, which is why you're all hooked on pain pills and antidepressants. Anything that's restricted in Europe will sell like fucking cronuts state-side. Plus 75% of burn patients are treated at specialist centres in the US vs about a third in Europe. The icing on the cake is that VCEL dropped 8% after their Q1 earnings so i'm picking shares up at a discount. Will be seeing how things develop over the next few weeks / month either buying dips or closing if/when i'm up 15-20%. Bear in mind **FDA approval likely isn't until the end of 2020** \\- if I had the patience I'd hold these guys for the long term but I know i'll just get bored. I'm looking to ride the recent positive sentiment up and then dump in a month or less.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**$VFF (BEAR - mid-term)**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVillage Farms have had a good run recently. Nominally a fruit and veg grower, in 2017 they formed a joint venture with Emerald Health Therapeutics, called Pure Sunfarms, to grow cannabis, . Pure Sunfarms is profitable and all looks hunky dory for now BUT:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) Village Farms are one of the most inefficient cannabis growers out there, with crop yields of less than 100 grams per square foot. Average is 100 grams or more, but compare this to Flowr Corp which use genetics to boost yields to about 300 grams per square foot. It means Village Farms are likely to have higher production costs and lower margins.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) Pure Sunfarms have yet to secure buyers for most of their product. Couple this with general market oversupply of weed and you have a recipe for crushed prices and dreams.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) Village Farms stock price has jumped recently which means at best a correction and at worst a dump as investors realise there are much better growers out there. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe way the cannabis industry is going at the moment, we should expect a contraction as the mom and pop and have-a-go growers get squeezed out by WEED CORP. I think Village Farms had a great idea to diversify into a profitable product using their existing infrastructure, but growing weed isn't like growing tomatoes. They either take it seriously and upgrade their farms and up their yield, or they fade away and go back to aubergines full time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEither way, I'm bearish in the short to mid term - hoping to close positions by the end of May, but may hang on a bit longer if weed prices take the downturn I'm expecting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd that's it for this week.
