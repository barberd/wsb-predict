Over 16 million unemployed.\n\nWe also know that the fed had late night meetings on Wednesday night, expanding their QE policies, one that allowed them to buy \u201cJunk Rated Corporate Bonds\u201d\n\nSo I see tomorrow 1 of 2 ways. \n\nEither 1) The FED announces tomorrow that they are buying equities directly (essentially extremely unconstitutional) and the stock market fucking booms +5%\n\nor 2) The bankers now know that the fed will NOT be having any secret meetings announcing new forms of QE, the unemployment numbers are bad, and we TANK. \n\nI\u2019m leaning towards #2, I feel that is why the markets are down today is because the Bankers with the insider information know they will not be getting a FED deal tomorrow. \n\nThoughts?\n\nMy positions: TSLA $520 P 7/17, VXX $43 C 5/22\nHTHT $25 P 6/19", "created_utc": 1586965098.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1uazm/tinfoil_hat_time_buy_puts/", "is_self": true}
