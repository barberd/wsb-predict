I did a quick search on WSB and couldn't find anything that was less than a few year old related to finding a good website / service to invest, track and monitor investments whatever. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI rolled over a small 401k (under 3K) I forgot about to SOFI. It seems pretty legit, but I also understand that it's fairly young and that there could be more robust stuff out there.  I plan on investing a lot more heavily towards the end of the year after some more research.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***SOFI's \"aggressive\" auto-investing thing:***\n\n* *\\~60% SOFI Select 500 ETF*\n* *\\~7% SOFI Next 500 ETF*\n* *\\~3.5% Vanguard Small CAP ETF*\n* *\\~24% Vanguard Developing Market ETF*\n* *\\~8% Vanguard Emerging Markets ETF*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I'm curious to know if a website / service exists:**\n\n* Something that tracks stocks, etc in one place\n   * *Obviously a shit load of places, but is there one that is well known among independent investors for nice UI or something like that?*\n* Alerts you if anything drops substantially  / gains substantially. \n   * *Is there a tool that would tell u \"hey this particular thing has gained X % over the last 4 weeks\". (not followed) Also understand that this might not make sense for relative percentages for smaller $ stuff*\n* A place where you can also learn about trends, or investing in general\n   * *SOFI has this to a small degree, and also starting to read investopedia. Understand that this is a stretch*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat other criteria do you consider when looking into an investing platform?", "created_utc": 1559512583, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bw2tv4/what_is_the_best_website_to_track_investments/", "is_self": true}
