{"id": "h76xkb", "title": "Have you autists heard of strangles or straddles?", "selftext": "Most of y'all autists on here think theres only two plays, calls and puts. You do know that you can buy BOTH calls and puts on the SAME stock in ONE transaction, right? A straddle is where both the stike prices on the calls and puts have to be the same and is a great way to play volatility. A strangle is where the put strike price is lower than the calls. I normally go with strangles because it is cheaper to buy a slightly OTM call and then a slightly OTM put than it is to buy a call and put near the money at the same strike price\n\nStrangles made me a killing all through March. One day I sell my puts, next day green I sell calls. Open another strangle\n\nRight now, it seems many think the market is going to go down but it was just two days ago where everyone thought it would just keep going up. A  LONG DATED strangle allows you to basically always make money unless the market stays flat. I opened up one on SPY this morning and profited huge on the put side, enough that is has covered double what I paid for the call. Now if that call expires worthless it don't matter, I made money. I SPY shoots up? I made more money\n\nShocked I do not see more straddles/strangles on here. It makes your break even harder sometimes as many times only one leg (the call or put) will come out profitable but it is much less autistic than yoloing on calls after a massive up swing, or, fomoing into expensive ass puts after a few red days.\n\nCurrently have July strangles open on SPY. Going to see what the market does tomorrow and open up some more", "created_utc": 1591910892.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h76xkb/have_you_autists_heard_of_strangles_or_straddles/", "is_self": true}
