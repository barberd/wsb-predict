Hyped by amazon partner and people think it'll be acquired. Comparison stores are more like M, Macys, or even jc penney. IE, always empty. As opposed to TGT or WMT, always full. Macys is worth 5b and jc penney is worth a penny. \n\nWhat do you guys think? Seems obvious to me. I got end of week $55 puts. Was only like $1, and this is dropping to like $48. Intrinsic of $7 per put, or $700 gain after IV crush.
