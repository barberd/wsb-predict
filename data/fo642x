GROW A PAIR YOU FUCKING PUSSY. You think we came this far to fold? From getting fucked quadruply from witches left right and centre, getting fucked by the stimulus bill every week, getting fucked by retarded bulls week in and week out. You think we're here to fold? YOU THINK WE CAME THIS FAR TO SELL BEFORE APRIL?\n\nARE YOU DUMB OR ARE YOU DUMB?\n\ndo me a fucking favour, go to the closest mirror thats in your vicinity, loook in the mirror and slap yourself so hard that theres an echo in the room. Slap yourself so hard so you realize that your not drunk, its the markets. We will wait for the markets to sober up, we will wait when the president shuts down the whole country, we will wait when the unemployment numbers come out, we WILL follow suit with italy's economy and europe's economy (unfortunately), we will have more cases and panic.. this fucking list goes on.\n\nBIG RALLY = BIG FALL\n\nRemember, it doesn't matter how much money the feds offer coronavirus, the ronazz will keep on taking. We gave that bitch TRILLIONS and she still wants more? Us fucking bears realize that whatever amount of money we offer the ronazz it wont be enough. the ronazzz wants the WHOLE FUCKING WORLD, not a couple of trillions. smarten up bears. You weak bears are embarrassing us running around this forum crying that your puts are down.\n\nANY SPORTS BETTORS OUT THERE?\n\nSports betting = options trading, IMO. Except live odds are priced in with time decay for sports. lets play football for example:\n\n**april bag holders, we are in the fucking superbowl right now.** NOT MAY OR JUNE. WE ARE.\n\nWE ARE ONLY IN THE FIRST QUARTER. FIRST HALF. NOT EVEN SECONDS HALF.\n\nThe fucking superbowl half time show (country lockdown, unemployment numbers, aggressive testing, supply chains disruptions, earning and sales) HASN'T EVEN FUCKING STARTED YET.\n\nHOLD THE FUCKING LINE.\n\nTL/DR bears panicking right now, do me a ANOTHER favour, go to the fucking washroom, open up this link [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ikSfs9LETc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ikSfs9LETc) and stare at the mirror and follow what hes doing in the song. BEAT YOUR FUCKING CHEST HARDER AS THE SONG PROGRESSES, HUM LOUDER, BELIEVE HARDER AND STOP BEING A FUCKING COWARD AND ..\n\n**HOLD THE FUCKING LINE.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: positions like a true fucking retard IM ALL IN BITCH\n\n[https://imgur.com/sw0ilB1](https://imgur.com/sw0ilB1)\n\n[https://imgur.com/JgjPbVI](https://imgur.com/JgjPbVI)\n\nIT DOESNT GET MORE RETARDED THAN THIS BOYS. 2k -> 37k -> 11k. IM NOT FUCKING SELLING\n\n**HOLD THE FUCKING LINE. SCARED MONEY DON'T MAKE NO MONEY. DIAMONDS FUCKING HANDS.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT#2 centre and favour are spelled wrong.. im canadian. BTW thank you for that Colorado couple coming to Canada and giving Ontario our first ever corona case two weeks ago, we have 500 cases now because of you..\n\nEDIT#3 so much vaccine talks/cures. let me tell you something. I was alive when sars got introduced to the world. CV is even worse. they are both from the same family, the same strain. if we had a vaccine or a cure or something to suppress its rapid growth, we would have it by now and we would be working on a vaccine towards CV. reality is, they don't have one. everything is trial and error right now. clinical research trials takes years to produce and test. they are not going to come up with a vaccine before summer. stop being naive. look at the hard core facts with sars. there is no cure.
