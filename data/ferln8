Their job is to clean the cabin and baggage etc.., on a daily basis they tell me that they don\u2019t even give a shit about the task they have to perform or have the necessary tools on a GOOD DAY, before the virus times. And now he tells me that the airports are the most empty they\u2019ve ever seen, literally a ghost town at a time when it\u2019s usually busy. Oh but wait, here\u2019s the golden part.\n\nThey bring up a conversation about stock, and ask the autist one that is also screeching about stonks, me. Let it be know that THEY HAVE NEVER BOUGHT STONKS EVER, and guess what they just did... that\u2019s right they bought they\u2019re own companies stonk thinking this was a cheap price. and was convincing me to do the same and started flashing monthly low charts at me. These guys downloaded RH yesterday, have no idea about financial tools and how they function. No concept of market movements or anything, these guys are literal joe blow dumb fucks that jack off to pornhub when not at work. Of course that\u2019s why we\u2019re mates, but I so happen to be the most retarded one. Anywho, All of them bought stonks in airlines saying oh it\u2019s so cheap right now. Poor fucks. I tried to tell them how to get tendies but they literally are the r/investing types, if that. \n\nSo TLDR: my friends who work for an airline just downloaded RH and bought the underlying stonks for different airlines saying they\u2019re \u201ccheap\u201d and they will make quick money when they bounce. They\u2019re investment professionals now. \n\nThere\u2019s no fucking bounce coming boys. I hope to god you didn\u2019t put in a call.\n\nEdit: still can\u2019t spelly", "created_utc": 1583564098.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ferln8/no_your_39_call_will_not_hit/", "is_self": true}
