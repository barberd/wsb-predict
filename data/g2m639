THIS IS KEY.\n\nLook at it from a high-level. China will not want Tesla to be the sole dominator the Chinese market let alone the global market. They will continue to increase their stake in NIO and keep it afloat until it becomes a viable competitor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe reason for short dated calls is based on bullish TA (which i'm not going to share because \"imaginary lines\") It's continually closing at a higher daily average with good news to come.\n\nGetting leap calls on this is looking good as well.", "created_utc": 1587066543.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2m639/nio_chinas_tesla_competitor/", "is_self": true}
