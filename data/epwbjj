I shall being you office dwelling, brainwashed slaves the ability to value stocks.\n\nI don\u2019t have the answers outside of SM stock, but the way SM companies are valued are directly based on how many users they have on average PER quarter. The most valuable thing in social media platforms are the reach and influence they offer, not profitability, or advertising revenue. \n\nThe correlation follows: 1 user is worth approximately 10 million dollars.\n\nIf you don\u2019t believe me look at how these prices vs user count.\n\n$TWTR = 34.19,            USERS  =  321 million\n$SNAP = 18.35,             USERS =  190 million \n$FB        = 221.77,           USERS =  2.4 billion \n\nFollowing this logic, Twitter will consolidate around 32.10 line, while Snap chat naturally wants to shoot up and swing back down consolidating around the 19.00 line. I would not recommend trading options for these stocks.

There at least $2 worth of gapping up and which will over shoot the 25.00 line before it comes back down and consolidates around $25 dollars a share.\n\nIf you have never tipped your toes in $BECKY, you\u2019re fucking retarded, the money flows like water with minimal strategy needed...the market IS run by BASIC bitches after all, plus wedding season is upon us. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n\u201cWhat is God is one of us?\u201d", "created_utc": 1579240553, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/epwbjj/how_to_value_social_media_stock_special_needs/", "is_self": true}
