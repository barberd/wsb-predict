In order to save oil from tanking even more AND to profit from the sweet sweet WAR ECONOMY TENDIES , the US of motherfuckin' A will start a big ass war with Iran. Last month, a bunch of their generals died mysteriously from COVID-19 so that's a big sign of bad things coming. Also remember one of their top generals being bombed to the stratosphere earlier this year? Yeah, the US is not going to stop there. We will have IRAQ/Afghanistan 2.0 but this one will last for decades to come. Anyways, buy \"defense\" calls.\n\nBA $250c 11/20\nRTX $150c 8/21", "created_utc": 1587108128.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2x62r/america_will_go_to_war_with_iran_in_2020/", "is_self": true}
