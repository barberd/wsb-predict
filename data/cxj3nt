{"id": "cxj3nt", "title": "Buy QD: DD", "selftext": "On both technical and fundamental evaluation, Qudian is a screaming buy.  They are a small credit lending company to individuals (a highly underserved market) that has developed a credit ranking model that has proven to mitigate risks of bad clients.  Their automatic credit ranking is so good, they are able to sell qualified customers to larger institutions that provide loans greater than QD is willing to initiate.  And they get a fee for the referral, which is 100% profit with no risks on QD\u2019s books.\n\nFundamental that say BUY:\nForward PE 3.31!\n$195M share repurchasing initiated by management since stock is so undervalued\n2019 EPS estimate of 2.06, posted 1.64 for 3 quarters.  High probability that 2019 EPS will beat 2.06\n87% YoY growth \n1.2 price to book, 1.9 price to sales\n\nWhy is QD stock so low?  Well #1 is because this company is in China, and #2 there was regulatory change to the financial lending markets in China and QD got roped into the bad P2P lending group despite them not doing P2P lending.  Also fear of defaults, but delinquency rates have been low (can\u2019t find the number right now).\n\nGrowth potential: They have been developing their open platform to collect premium by referring loans larger than they are willing to underwrite to large banks.  Large banks in China do not normally serve individuals, so there is a huge underserved market.  China is transforming into a consumer culture and with that you need access to credit.  QD may become the China equivalent of our large credit institutions (like Equifax) that produces a score that determines the credit trustworthiness of an individual.     \n\nFrom the technical point, we\u2019ve got a fat cup and handle.  I\u2019ll let you draw your own voodoo lines, but I\u2019m seeing from July \u201818 to August \u201819 is your cup, and we\u2019ve been in the handle since the middle of August.  If you believe hard enough that means rocket ships to the moon in September/October.  \n\nSo what do you want to do?  I think this thing is super undervalued.  And I think the trade war and China\u2019s economy getting crushed is overblown.  I think China\u2019s middle class and consumerism will continue to grow and they need access to credit.  Even if this stock were to double, it still would be undervalued.  \n\nWhat did I do?  I\u2019m thinking a few years out and I got Jun 2021 LEAPS at $15 strike.  I also got a few September 20 $9 because of high interest.
