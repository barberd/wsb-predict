DD inside.", "selftext": "no strike or exp given low liquidity. sorry boys, this is a boring, plain old stock play\n\ni have a lot of notes but just going to hit the highlights here, i welcome any thoughts from anyone who knows the industry tho.\n\n**business model**\n\n-- it's a very simple one: customers are given short-term (30 - 60 days) loans based on the assessed value of a product which they post as collateral (jewelry, electronics, guns, whatever). these loans are super expensive (good for pawn shop), and if they're unpaid, the collateral is sold at a ~40% markup (great margins).\n\n**thesis:**\n\n-- High unemployment and economic uncertainty will increase demand for pawn loans as consumer credit availability shrinks in a recessionary environment. \n\n-- credit risk is extremely limited given modest LTV, 100% collateral loans, and 30 \u2013 60 day credit terms (vs. months \u2013 years for subprime lenders). also, collateral from unpaid loans turn to high-margin retail sales -- credit risk is really just inventory pricing risk\n\n-- $FCFS is down 25% from YTD high and 36% from 2019 high and is poised to break out of ATH in the next few years. however, there's more room to fall short-term given uncertain timing of reopenings w/r/t COVID-19, liekly additional stimulus, and continued moratoriums on debts/bills/other consumer liabilities\n\n-- the stock has been punished in the face of gov't stimulus, which has reduced demand for pawn loans, and COVID-19 fears. however, long-term, demand for pawn loans should come back strong and 98% of stores actually continue to be open.\n\n**what i like**\n\n-- YTD performance has been great. retail sales are up 30% in April (!!), granted, mostly from products for working-from-home and gaming consoles and the like\n\n-- pawn loan business is super high margin and should increase in share as subprime lenders tap out\n\n-- domestic units are not mall-based\n\n-- positive SSS through '08 crisis and incredible stock performance coming out of it\n\n-- historically a very good operator and integrator. some of the stats on the CashAmerica acquisition are great (e.g., retail margins at those stores increased from 33% to ~40%). this company is very big on inorganic growth so this is really important\n\n-- ample liquidity ($80mm cash, $200mm available under RCF, highly liquid inventory) and significant debt capacity under existing credit agreement\n\n-- these guys love their share buy backs, and the debt documents are pretty generous in allowing buybacks. program has been temporarily suspended, expect it to come back strong mid-to-post recession (if not sooner...)\n\n**what i dont like**\n\n-- pawn shop market is highly fragmented, low brand equity, low barriers to entry (but also who gives a shit)\n\n-- regulatory risk as socialism becomes more popular and negative sentiment towards consumer predatory practices grows\n\n-- more stimulus + continued moratoriums on bills reduces demand for pawn loans. i see this as very short term tho.\n\n-- LatAm and FX risk. Most LatAm stores are really in Mexico, a market i admittedly don't know well. the plus side on FX is most foreign cash is re-invested locally, it just translates to lower earnings in USD\n\n**TL;DR:** companies that make money off poor people will do well in a recession", "created_utc": 1587881312.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g89byn/fcfs_long_pawn_shops_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
