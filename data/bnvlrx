I am not responsible for the IRS knocking down your door and throwing you in prison. I\u2019m just an angry man trying to understand why you guys parrot anything read on this subreddit with no evidence of if it exists. Do your own research or ask an ACTUAL professional if you\u2019re still unsure of what is considered a wash sale.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Okay, listen up fuckers. I\u2019m so god damn sick of seeing:**\n \n\u201cI can\u2019t sell my 100 shares I bought 5 days ago for 25 more days thanks to wash-sale rule\u201d\n\n\u201cWatch out for wash sale rule, otherwise you can\u2019t claim your losses.\u201d\n\n\u201cI successfully managed to avoid wash sale this year\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nHow so many of you guys have absolutely no idea what the hell you are talking about is astonishing. Especially for something that I know personally has affected all us idiots while calculating your losses for the year.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nThe fucking wash sale definition in Publication 550 from the IRS is 202 words. **LITERALLY 202 WORDS. READ IT, HOLY FUCK. I EVEN ATTACHED A LINK OF IT, YOU DON\u2019T HAVE TO SEARCH ANYTHING, LITERALLY JUST CLICK THIS LINK:**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n------------------------&gt; [CLICK THIS MORON](https://i.imgur.com/nNk8C2R.png) &lt;---------------------------------\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u201cSee! It says right there, I cannot deduct losses sales or trades of stock or securities in a wash sale.\u201d\n\n**READ THE WHOLE THING GOD DAMN IT. FUCK.**\n\nOkay, so maybe you read the whole thing, and your smooth brain is working overtime trying to both expand your vocabulary from 35 to 86 unique words as well as processing basic information, so I\u2019ll help break it down for you:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**\u201cWhy does the Wash Sale Rule exist?\u201d**\n\n\nThe first step to understanding WHAT the wash sale rule is, is WHY the wash sale rule was created, we\u2019ll start off with an example that may seem very familiar to some of you:\n\nThe date is June 8th, 2018 at 3:55pm, MU is trading at $61. You\u2019re feeling slightly less autistic than normal, and decide you\u2019re sick of losing money and instead of buying calls which expire in literally 5 minutes, you\u2019re going to buy $MU 90C 1/17/20. You buy 1 $MU 90C 1/17/20 for $500, you feel incredibly confident in your purchase.\n\nFast forward a couple months. It\u2019s now December 28th 2018, MU is at $31.57, your MU $90C 1/17/20 option is now worth about a bucket of chicken from KFC, say $20 for this example. The end of the year is days away, and like usual, you\u2019re trying to figure out how much money you lost this year. You really want to claim your $480 unrealized loss on MU, but you, like a battered woman developing Stockholm syndrome, really believe $MU is your financial savior and want to keep your position.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n***BRILLIANT IDEA:***\n&gt; \u201cI\u2019m going to sell my option, and realize my loss for $480, then subsequently rebuy it for $20, now I\u2019ll be able to both claim my loss, and keep my position!\u201d\n\n**WRONG: THIS TRIGGERS A WASH SALE.**\n&gt;\u201cOh okay. Wait\u2026 I have a better idea, I\u2019m going to buy the same option today, and sell THE one tomorrow, that works right? I can claim my losses because FIFO right?\u201d\n\n**WRONG AGAIN. THE IRS THOUGHT ABOUT THAT TOO.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThat\u2019s why in the 202 words I linked, *that you should\u2019ve read btw*, the IRS says \n&gt;A wash sale occurs when you sell or trade stock or securities at a loss and within 30 days before or after the sale\u2026\u201d.\n\n **30 DAYS BEFORE OR AFTER.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nOur little buddy trying the game the system is exactly why the wash sale rule was created. People generating \u201closses\u201d on positions they still hold. In this scenario you\u2019d be unable to claim your losses on this sale. \n\nIt\u2019s okay my special little friend, your losses don\u2019t magically go away to some wash sale overlord at the IRS, let me explain the part that way too many fucking people don\u2019t read, it\u2019s covered in literally the last paragraph of the definition:\n\n&gt;\u201cIf your loss was disallowed because of the wash sale rules, add the disallowed loss to the cost of the new stock or securities (except in (4) above). The result is your basis in the new stock or securities. This adjustment postpones the loss deduction until the disposition of the new stock or securities. Your holding period for the new stock or securities includes the holding period of the stock or securities sold.\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n&gt;\"so what dat mean.\"\n\n\nThat means when you trigger a wash sale, your losses are essentially \u201cRolled\u201d into the cost of your repurchased position. Let\u2019s go back to our special friend and his $MU option:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nAction 1. Buys $MU 90C 1/17/20 for $500 in June\n\nAction 2: Sells $MU 90C 1/17/20 for $20 on December 28th 2018 ($480 Realized Loss)\n\nAction 3: Repurchases $MU 90C 1/17/20 for $20 on December 28th 2018 \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe repurchasing (Action 3) triggers a wash sale because he bought an IDENTICAL position with 30 days of selling the same position. He CANNOT claim his $480 Loss in 2018. Although he cannot claim $480 on his taxes for 2018, the repurchasing the $MU 90C 1/17/20 has its **COST BASIS ADJUSTED** to include his loss. So, that means the repurchasing of the IDENTICAL option for $20 is actually treated as if he bought it for $500 ($20 Cost + $480 Loss from wash sale). This means that when our autistic little friend\u2019s option expires worthless on Jan 17th, 2020 he\u2019ll be able to claim the **FULL $500 loss he experienced**. *The loss didn\u2019t disappear, it\u2019s still existing in his held position.*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nLet\u2019s play out the same scenario except on December 28th our friend has a revelation and realizes he\u2019d rather feed himself KFC than watch his account hit 0.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nAction 1: Buys $MU 90C 1/17/20 for $500 in June\n\nAction 2: Sells $MU 90C 1/17/20 for $20 on December 28th 2018 ($480 Realized Loss)\n\nAction 3: Repurchases $MU 90C 1/17/20 for $20 on December 28th 2018  (Wash Sale triggers and this repurchasing is treated as if he paid $500 thanks to Cost basis adjustment)\n\nAction 4: Realizes he\u2019s a fucking idiot and sells it again on December 28th 2018 at the ABSOLUTE BOTTOM for $10 before market closes. (*Classic*)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nSo he triggered wash sale, cost basis of the repurchasing stock is adjusted to $500 ($20 cost + $480 loss) BUT, he sells it immediately after! Guess what? **HE CAN CLAIM $490 ($500-$10) IN LOSSES, EVEN THOUGH HE TRIGGERED A WASH SALE ALONG THE WAY.** That\u2019s right, if you exit your whole fucking position, and don\u2019t buy back in within 30 days you can claim losses. Even if you do buy back in **ALL YOUR LOSSES ARE ROLLED INTO THE NEXT TIME YOU REPURCHASE.** This rule of \u201cexiting your entire position\u201d applies to almost every scenario.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n &gt;\u201cWhoah, so you mean I don\u2019t have to wait 30 days after buying XX option/stock/position to sell it?\u201d\n\n**No you fucking idiot**, you do realize people trade for a living? Like how the fuck do you expect EVERY loss a swing trader experiences during the course of a 30 day window to somehow not count at the end of the year? Christ.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nPSA: Alright, there\u2019s some exceptions to the wash-sale rule, mainly from tax advantaged accounts and combinations of buying options to replace selling stocks and vice versa, but I\u2019m not going to go through every possible scenario. If you guys are day trading options in your Roth IRAs you\u2019re beyond saving anyways. Hopefully most of you morons have at least a fundamental understanding of wash sales. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nIf you want more examples or want to read to rule yourself read publication 550 jesus:\n\nhttps://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/p550--2018.pdf", "created_utc": 1557703088, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bnvlrx/wash_sale_fundamentals_how_to_read_basic_tax/", "is_self": true}
