Wouldn't this be a good reason to avoid XOM, or divest it if you already have it, or short it on the assumption that they are going to have to reduce the dividend at some point in the future?", "created_utc": 1580508134, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ewvsgm/is_exxons_xom_dividend_payout_ratio_unsustainable/", "is_self": true}
