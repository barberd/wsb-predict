The fund buys the futures contracts for next month and then sells them before expiration because they do not take physical delivery, they only trade the contracts and use the profits to buy more contracts the next month. This makes them a great growth fund when the price of oil is rising predictably because they can make constant profits with relatively low risk.\n\n**Oil's Collapse:**\n\n[On 4\\/20\\/2020 the current month's futures contracts went negative.](https://preview.redd.it/1u1mg3nvpuv41.png?width=678&format=png&auto=webp&s=37650c8de22d5a58d2dc4fc7d9d827a430a71808)\n\n4/20/20, the current month's contracts went negative due to them being dumped on the market with no buyers.\n\nOn the Morning of April 20th, 2020, the current Futures contracts went about $45 dollars to -$37 for a short period of time. This meant that if you purchased a single contract you would be paid $3,700 at expiration to take delivery of 1,000 barrels of crude oil from Cushing, OK. This was extremely important because those futures are what a majority of USO's value is based on. The contracts gain value over the course of the month, then are sold and new contracts are purchased the next month. However, with no demand for oil, the fund is left holding the bag on the contracts they can't sell. They lose value and expire worthless for the fund causing it to bleed money. A word you might have just recently heard because of this situation is Contango, which is a condition in which future months trade at a premium to the spot price and the nearby contract. When USO sells this month for a low price, and has to buy next months at a high price, that is where they lose money.\n\nRight now, USO's price is being driven by both supply and demand for USO shares as well as the price of the underlying contracts. They filed with the SEC to register another 4 billion shares, but this has not become effective yet. They've also completed a 1 to 8 reverse split, bringing their price from $2.14 to about $18.00 to keep themselves from being delisted from the NYSE. They have also updated their prospectus and said that they plan to basically trade whatever contracts they would like in order to generate a profit.\n\n**Future of USO:**\n\nIn the coming months, even if oil demand makes a strong comeback before the end of the year, it will be difficult for the fund to continue to exist unless they basically change everything they do and become something else with the same ticker, which is entirely possible but the chances that they do that before losing too much value and being liquidated are small. My advice is to stay away from USO, it is not a normal stock, when it loses 90% of it's value there is not the price pressure to push it back up like in a normal stock. It can just continue on a downtrend until it gets delisted and that is what I expect to happen.\n\n**Edit:**\n\nMust've fucked up when I posted this seems I cut off the section about some tips for trading oil.\n\n\\> Be patient, there's going to be a lot more pain in the oil industry and it's best to sit back and react to the shakeout.\n\n\\> Buy the big guys, there's going to be a lot of bankruptcies of smaller lower margin companies and the bigger companies with their massive balance sheets flush with cash will be able to buy their assets and wells at steep discounts.\n\n\\> XOM, CVX, BP,  and RDS.A a are all good places to start, they are likely to be long term winners in this situation.\n\n\\> If you want to trade the direct crude price I suggest WTI, biggest and most well known index.\n\nGood luck.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1588207264.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/galkk6/what_happened_to_uso_and_what_does_their_future/", "is_self": true}
