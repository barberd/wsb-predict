{"id": "cujdif", "title": "Highly technical options algorithmic analysis (High IQ readers ONLY)", "selftext": "A few minutes ago, Chesapeake Energy Corp (CHK) had ITM 1-week calls going for 33% of the stock price (AUG 30 $1 CALL for $0.48, current stock was $1.48).\n\nIf I sell a covered call then sell the stock immediately after the strike passes (Monday morning), I get 33% from the premium and hopefully all the stock money back  (minus commission). Two risks:\n\n    stock goes down (max loss = 100%)\n    call gets exercised (max 33% loss = [1 - 1.48] / 1.48)\n\n**How often do ITM options get exercised/assigned?** If I assume a 50% exercise/assign rate and 50% chance of increase/decreased stock, that would average out to 8% profit each week (50% * 50% * 33%). Certainly better than my IRA.", "created_utc": 1566591821, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cujdif/highly_technical_options_algorithmic_analysis/", "is_self": true}
