There's plenty of money to be made while GME goes belly up, but it ultimately goes to 0. \n\nAlso, the guidance that we need to wait until the end of 2020 for a console release to possibly turn a profit is garbage. The manufacturers might be keeping disc drive, but the next generation of digital marketing is going to just eat up more business from GME. The CEO of GME speaks of vendor relations. The vendors do not care for GME. They would rather see them out of business. GME have been the leeches of the video game business for years. Now not even the customers want anything to do with them , they want to turn a new leaf? Pleeeease.\n\nIs that why they committed a whopping 0.2% of their stores to take part of a test market of rebooting into hangouts. They will not even share the data on these stores. The business model already exists and they are called gaming cafes. They are dedicated to providing comfortable spaces for gamers and their friends. Their margins are thin and require lots of dedication to be successful. GME doesn't have the wherewithal and will fail miserably.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust look at a 5 year chart.
