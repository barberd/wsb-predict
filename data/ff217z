This is really alarming shit. This is an old figure from yesterday, but it tells a really clear picture:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](ilat4xxqbbl41)\n\nThese numbers will make this virus one of the deadliest of all time. Sure, viruses like Ebola might kill at a higher percentage, but when you have a virus with a two-three week latency period, that is more infectious than the flu, and a death rate rivaling \\~4% after 100k cases, this is going to cause panic and significant economic damage. The only reason China has begun to stave off new infections is due to successful mass quarantine programs. In democratic societies where such drastic measures will likely not be imposed, and certainly would be weakly enforced, the potential for constant spread is alarming. \n\nWhat is more alarming to me is what the virus does to people's lungs. There are reports coming out of China describing patient autopsies. Here is a direct quote from an autopsy study:\n\n\"Massive pulmonary interstitial fibrosis, and partly hyaline degeneration, variable degrees of hemorrhagic pulmonary infarction\"\n\nThe full abstract is here:\n\n[https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202002.0407/v3](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202002.0407/v3)\n\nThese finding are scary AF! Even if you survive your lungs will likely be scarred (we call this fibrosis in medicine). When your lungs become fibrotic they lose their elasticity and thus it becomes difficult to inhale and exhale - think of long-term smokers, miners with black lung, people exposed to asbestos, etc. Just like these diseases, it will take time for the scarring to take it's toll, and likely complicate old age for those infected at a younger age. For those who can't imagine the feeling, its like a slower way of drowning to death: instead of not being able to breath at all, you get little half breaths so you are constantly moving in and out of that panicked state of drowning.\n\nFirst and foremost, STAY SAFE. \n\nThere are some woo-woo remedies that have helped in previous respiratory virus outbreaks, but the evidence is really weak. For those interested, and willing to yolo on some unproven Chinese medicine, read this abstract:\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32065348](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32065348)\n\nQuote from the article: \"The most frequently used herbs included Radix astragali (Huangqi), Radix  glycyrrhizae (Gancao), Radix saposhnikoviae (Fangfeng), Rhizoma  Atractylodis Macrocephalae (Baizhu), Lonicerae Japonicae Flos  (Jinyinhua), and Fructus forsythia (Lianqiao).\"\n\nI am a financial newb, I literally started investing February 16th. FUCK MY LIFE. So, I'm not going to make any financial predictions or make any recommendations. I trust everyone on the forum will ingest this info and make their own predictions.\n\nFor those making obscene comments like \"we will have a vaccine by summer\", this is dumb. Most treatments takes several years before a clinical trail begins, and this is with millions of dollars of support and 100s of researchers working day-in day-out. If we have any treatment, if ever, that would be an anomaly, and I would certainly enjoy eating my words. Note that most pharma companies will announce they are working on something and intend to start a clinical trial soon, which is fine for investing sake, but the reality is none of these promises will be upheld and certainly not before the virus runs it natural course. \n\nOn a final note, STAY SAFE. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS: I love this forum. I made an account just to write this post. My spouse and I laugh our asses off at this sub's content. A lot of the content is also really good and because of it we are seriously considering getting in to options trading.
