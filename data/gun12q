Currently Cinemark is trading around $15.50 and I\u2019m eyeing 15p for an earnings play. \n\nGoogle cinemark and all theaters across the country have been closed since mid March (over 1/2 this earnings period). Productions companies have halted all movie productions and started delaying showings. \n\nOutlook looks miserable as other theater companies have filed for bankruptcy already, and I have no idea how it\u2019s trading green today. \n\nTLDR: 6/19 15p   Thank me later \n\nThoughts?", "created_utc": 1591026737.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gun12q/cnk_earnings_play/", "is_self": true}
