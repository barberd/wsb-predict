{"id": "gindj3", "title": "Low IV, low premium, high volume call options with June/July expirations", "selftext": "I've used an options screener software to filter some June/July calls and I decided to share my results with the WSB community (because I'm a nice person). I've filtered only for calls (bears can fuck off) with less than 40% IV and decent volume. I also screened for low premium options because I know you poor fucks can't afford expensive ones.\n\nI hand picked a few based on some other criteria (i.e., how much below is it from fair value, is it a nice innovative company etc.). This list doesn't include any meme stocks, because I know you all are looking for things that are not being mentioned on fucking WSB. Here are the results:\n\n* CMCSA 40c 7/17 - 26.64% IV --> $0.3 premium\n* TWNK 12.5c 6/19 - 28.48% IV --> $0.1 premium\n* INTC 70c 7/17 - 31.03% IV --> $0.26 premium\n* INTC 65c 6/19 - 31.47% IV --> $0.45 premium\n* VOD 17c 6/19 - 31.69% IV --> $0.07 premium\n* ALXN 120c 6/19 - 33.9% IV --> $0.25 premium\n* TAK 20c 6/19 - 38.29% IV --> $0.15 premium\n* FDX 140c 6/19 - 38.42% IV --> $0.2 premium\n\nI threw two telcos in there: CMCSA and VOD. Both are undervalued imo. Intel is also heavily overlooked these days, and with today's dip, presents a unique opportunity. ALXN is a parma company that crushed their earnings despite working on non-covid related stuff, which is a strong statement to big investors that company is resilient. Rest of them you can do you own due diligence.\n\nLet's discuss together. Two autists are better than one, so we make semi-autist decisions!", "created_utc": 1589327220.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gindj3/low_iv_low_premium_high_volume_call_options_with/", "is_self": true}
