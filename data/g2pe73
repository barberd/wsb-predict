It can\u2019t be the fact that most of you get your financial advice from shitty memes on Reddit or do absolutely no DD, no it has to be the market\u2019s fault your absurd gambling, and that\u2019s what it is, isn\u2019t making you all rich. If I had a dollar for every retarded reason I\u2019ve seen someone blame their options not making them money on something dumb like J Powell, Money Printers, evil capitalism, stonks only going up, or \u201crich people\u201d, id have enough money to offset all your losses. \n\nI get it, you made money buying calls you didn\u2019t understand in the largest bull market run ever, and now you think if you do the opposite it\u2019ll work too. Never mind the fact that something like this has never happened before so we have no idea how the market is going to react, or that the market already dropped 35% weeks ago which accounted for many of the employment and revenue figures you are seeing now, instead y\u2019all see a reddit post made by a high schooler on why the market is doomed and think that should be the actual indicator of why the market should be lower. \n\nAnd now the dumbest shit is how political everything is getting on this sub. Somehow the morons that think they are experts on stocks they don\u2019t understand now think they are experts on politics they don\u2019t understand too. Look at half the posts in the last few weeks for an example, but just today I\u2019ve seen someone not know the difference between a loan and a grant and someone else not know what franchising a restaurant was, yet still argue that somehow the government was screwing up and causing their losses. Yeah no shit this situation hasn\u2019t been handled perfectly, both economically and medically, but then maybe don\u2019t throw your life savings in Robinhood and gamble all your money away if you don\u2019t think the market is acting rationally. \n\nThe best part is that the majority of the people here are weathering their first economic crisis as an adult, yet still think they know better than everyone else on what the market should be doing. \n\nTake responsibility for your losses, don\u2019t gamble away money on stuff you don\u2019t understand then blame it on someone else. Hell, most of the trades here even during the bull market were stupid and the gains were blind luck. Quit complaining, grow up, and for the love of god research the shit your blowing all your money on.", "created_utc": 1587076637.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2pe73/you_morons_need_to_take_responsibility_for_your/", "is_self": true}
