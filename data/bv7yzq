{"id": "bv7yzq", "title": "Think or Swim? Options?", "selftext": "I have been investing for over a year now.  Did some paper trading before I got into the market and like where I am at.  Looking into learning to trade options and want to open a paper account.  I did my own tracking and paper trading before I started on RH using a notebook and no real tools (no web based tools).  I am curious about using TD Ameritrades \"Think or swim\" paper account to learn options before I go live with my real monies.  Anyone have any pros/cons?  \n\nI just can't see trying to learn options without a live but fake account. Does the paper account look and feel like a live account in all ways?", "created_utc": 1559311744, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bv7yzq/think_or_swim_options/", "is_self": true}
