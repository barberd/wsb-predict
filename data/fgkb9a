We're in the midst of a pandemic that will kill millions. This virus is as infectious as smallpox and over 30\u00d7 as lethal as the flu ,with an R0 of 4.7-6.6 and mortality rate of 3.4%-15% at low end estimates.  \n\ntransmission is possible 7-14 days before you even develop symptoms and the earliest we could have a vaccine/cure is 12-18 months from now. \nThe stock market has tanked over the past 2 weeks due to supply shortages of both consumer goods and medicine ( over 80% of pharmaceutical drug ingredients and 98% of antibiotics come from China) This is far more dangerous than many are being led to believe. \n  The Economic and societal impact will be tremendous unlike anything the world has seen in over 2 generations.\nI have cited sources below.
