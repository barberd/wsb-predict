Options investing is risky and volatile, and you should be prepared and able to sustain 100% loss of any capital invested. This post and replies by author do not take into account any individual\u2019s personal situation or circumstances.

If you do decide to take these trades, I plan on getting into them as well. Trade at your own risk, **this is not investment advice, it's simply a transcription of my own notes that I'm willing to share.** *When I use the term YOLO play,* ***it doesn't necessarily mean FD's,*** because some tickers are light on option chains. Out of the trades listed, the YOLOs may have the most upside percentage gain potential but probably the most risk. **I will not give you advice on your own situation, nor on what you should do with a particular position.** Do your own due diligence. \n\n# Some Thoughts For This Week\n\nI'm going to start by reiterating the same shit I said last week, except this week, I'm going to be a bit more cold hearted about it. When you enter or exit a trade is your OWN DEAL. I cannot and will not give you advice on any of your own trades or positions. This is part of the learning process. Moreover, trading is about simply selling something for more than you bought it for. I don't have any hard and fast rules I follow, I simply do it by feel and intuition.\n\n# How My Picks Are Generated\n\nThese plays are found using my own scanner criteria across a variety of metrics depending on market conditions. Picks are generated from that scan. Those scans are ran through scripts that check certain volatility skews. These are my own scripts, and I won't divulge much more than that about it. The indicative theory here is sell IV when it's high and buy IV when it's low, follow trends and follow the big money. Volatility is literally the most important aspect in options pricing and finding positive EV situations. A few of the criteria for the ToS scans are:\n\n* Market cap of $5B+\n* Daily volume of 1M+\n* Volume, volume differential, RSI, 52 week low's and high's, ToS sizzle, and a few others decide what comes out of the scan, then selected as a pick based on script results/current market conditions/sentiment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Results On Last Week's Picks\n\n**Twitter (TWTR) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- I played this harder than some of my other picks. It didn't do nearly as well as Bank of America early in the week, but overall, it did good. I'm still bullish on Twitter, and personally think it's busting out of some long term consolidation. It peaked almost 10% from the start of the week, my spreads worked out, I am personally holding a few longer termed contracts.\n\n**Gamestop (GME) -** ***BEARISH*** \\- So, they definitely ate shit on earnings, I sold half my contracts at open and the other half basically broke even because of IV. I wasn't looking to hold them and watch the company drive into the ground, made an okay profit, but I was hoping the bottom would fall out after earnings. Either way, the company is not looking well and is eventually going to 0 or getting acquired.\n\n**Aurora Cannabis (ACB) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- This one didn't really work out for me. I've been averaging down anyway because I'm stubborn and I think it's going up, but, whatever - can't all be two and three baggers.\n\n**Bank of America (BAC) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Did exactly what I presumed it would. I'm not in any positions on this anymore, but it's staying on my radar. I expect financials to do well in the coming weeks, so I may randomly jump into it intraweek if I am feeling spicy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Picks for Week of April 8th, 2019\n\n**All of the commentary on specific plays are simply notes I wrote to myself. Each contract listed is not a suggestion to buy, but simply the ones I took notes on that I'm considering entering. These notes are not to you personally.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY) -** ***BEARISH*** \\- This company is a gigantic mess. They set extremely high guidance for whatever reason last time around, and I highly doubt that they're going to meet it. Their margins are awful, and the only reason we'd see activists going after the board is if the inner workings of the company were crumbling. I'm playing this as an earnings play, I'm already in some puts for it, and plan on being in more depending where movement goes this week pre-earnings. Even if they do somehow magically rise off their call, I'm bag holding them. It seems that with poor earning calls, the stock moves violently, sometimes as much as 20%. Market makers seem to be pricing in about a $2 move, which to me, is reasonable, but it could move as much as $3-$3.50 in my opinion based on everything going on.\n\n* **Short term earnings YOLO: 4/18 $16.50 puts @ $0.37 or $15.50 puts @ $0.17**\n   * I'm likely not bag holding these past earnings more than a couple hours after open Thursday. The $15.50 puts is a complete lotto ticket, kind of the $16.50's too but after the last couple weeks I'm feeling spicy and I might decide to throw a couple hundred at it and see if we can reverse that massive gap up they had earlier this month. 10-bagger territory potential. I expect to take these to 0 if they beat earnings by some miracle.\n* **Longer term: 5/17 $16 puts @ $0.62 or $15 puts @ $0.38**\n   * Not sure what I'll do with either of these, depends on price action on Thursday after open.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Delta Airline (DAL) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- They released some pretty killer news with their fuel costs potentially being flat, and even though they ran hard, I think it's got a ways longer to go. That news however is kind of concerning, almost as though to me they may be protecting against a bad earnings report. Either way, not enough for me to not bet on them. The stock trades at a very reasonable valuation, and they also don't have any 737 Max 8's in their fleet which kind of exempts them from being vulnerable to the production slowdowns Boeing just announced.\n\n* **YOLO: 4/12 $59 calls @ $0.60**\n   * IV is surprisingly low on these. Not sure why.\n* **Short term: 4/26 $61 calls @ $0.46**\n   * If earnings go well, I'd assume they continue climbing throughout the month, so bumping the strike a couple bucks seems reasonable for me.\n* **Long term: 6/21 $67.50 calls @ $0.22**\n   * I hold the same reasoning for potentially buying these as I do for the 4/26's, if they rise, and do well, they should keep rising on good guidance. Whether they can tack on all the way to expiration, idk, but there's probably a point I can find to exit these at a profit, and they're cheap.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Twitter (TWTR) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- I'm still bullish on Twitter. Check out the last couple weeks of posts for the reasons. \n\n* **YOLO: 4/12 $35 calls @ $0.45**\n   * If I decide to enter these, I'm going to be really attentive and micromanage the position, averaging down and potentially exiting if it goes against me.\n* **Short term: 4/18 $35.5 calls @ $0.48**\n   * Giving up .50 of strike spread and paying only a few bucks for it seems reasonable. I'm more tempted to play here, honestly.\n* **Long term: 6/21 $41 calls @ $0.81**\n   * If I play these, I'm going to be mindful around earnings, and perhaps manage this and jump out/in depending on any news/movement. If I'm really bullish, this would prove my position though huh\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Boeing (BA) -** ***BULLISH*** - So they said they're cutting production. Big whoop. They have piles of free cash flow, get a government contract every other week, and we've proven the $380 level to be pretty solid support. I imagine this claws it's way back to $400ish within a couple of weeks. For me, it's a true BTFD. I got lucky and cashed out debit spreads/calls on Friday morning so I didn't eat the downturn, either.\n\n* **Short term: 4/18 $397.5 calls**\n   * Probably micro managing these as well, just seems like they're so volatile there there could be a lot of building into the position/averaging the cost in order to see a solid profit here. I don't know the price because they gapped down like a mother fucker after hours on Friday.\n* **Long term: 6/21 $450 calls @ $2.22**\n   * This is the strike where it seems each $5 jump matters - these will likely be cheaper than listed, and offer a good chance. I don't plan on holding these until expiration unless the stock just explodes upward and I feel like I have enough cushion to sustain any bad news that may possibly come, although I still think the verdict is out and shit is priced in. I think the algo sell off on Friday will just rebound back up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Snap (SNAP) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- I know this sub loves to hate this stock, but I don't really care about their underlying business model. They also announced some semi-cool tech that will keep the white girls on the app longer on weekends, and it still stands as the easiest way to set up a way to chat to your mistress. Because of this -- they will likely survive just fine, even at a loss. The user base has to be worth something.\n\n* **ITM play: 4/12 $12 calls @ $0.26**\n   * I'm considering getting long shares and this seems like a decent price to pay to be able to watch and wait and see what happens this week.\n* **YOLO: 4/12 $12.50 calls @ $0.12 or $13 calls @ $0.06**\n   * They really don't have to go that far for these to profit and if there's any week they MIGHT rally through the recent gains, it would be this one.\n* **Long term: 5/24 $14 calls @ $0.44**\n   * Most likely not holding these to expiration, unless I see the type of run I'm expecting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Macy's (M) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- I didn't post this one last week, but I definitely benefited off their run on Thursday and walked into it by luck because I was about to liquidate my calls I had, and then noticed they were running really hard. I think that it's poised to keep running this week for multiple reasons and the options are dirt cheap based on a few factors.\n\n* **Short term/YOLO: 4/18 $26 calls @ $0.39, 4/12 $25.5s @ $0.46 or 4/12 $26 @ $0.24**\n   * If I go back in on any of these (I had $24.50's this week I sold on Thursday) then I'm going to monitor this stock closely. It's been consolidating like none other and could really be poised to gain some back, more importantly, the company is valued reasonable, trading at a decent ratio, and the options are pretty cheap.\n* **Long term: 8/16 $30 calls @ $0.78**\n   * If my thesis is right and I decide to go this route, I'm likely holding them and just accepting what happens for the next few months because if the stock at any point tacks on a significant amount, they could really skyrocket in value.\n\n# My Current Project\n\nI'm thinking of streaming a small account challenge 3 days a week (Tues, Weds, Thurs) on Twitch (1k-&gt;50k). I don't know though, I'll let you know if anything comes of it and I decide to do it and if I do, mods will have to approve it first. It's working out alright thus far, and I don't do much trading on Robinhood so I figured I would do something with some YOLO bucks to see what I can do. Part of it is to prove that people don't need 25k to make money trading, PDT isn't holding people back, and there's ways to increase a small account quickly without as much risk as some people take. We'll see if this comes to fruition or not.\n\n# Stocks That Could Be Worth A Look\n\n**Bullish:** Hostess (TWNK), Cars dot com (CARS), Banco Bilbao (BBVA), Humana (HUM), Cypress Semi (CY), Nordstrom (JWN), Hanesbrands (HBI), Fox Corp (FOXA), American Eagle (AEO)\n\n**Bearish:** Skechers (SKX), Home Depot (HD), Urban Outfitters (URBN), TJX (TJX), KB Home (KBH), Pagseguro Digital (PAGS), Citigroup (C), Navient (NAVI)\n\n# State of the Market\n\nWe're nearing all time highs right now, so one of two things is going to happen after the beginning of the week in my opinion. I say we start the week green, we'll quickly get to the all time high levels and test. If we get lucky and orange man says something good about the trade talks, it could provide the lift we need to get over it and keep going. The other choice, is we either see consolidation like we did for two days last week, trade mostly sideways, teeter around, and pull back slightly before resuming upwards to test it again. I plan on being really mindful of my positions and at any sign of a sell off like the one that occurred a couple of weeks ago - I may go to cash and evaluate.\n\n# About Correlated/Corresponding Picks\n\nCorrelated picks are important. An example is playing Apple/Facebook/Microsoft and SPY. If any of those gain, it's more likely SPY gains that week since it's weighted towards them, and the S&amp;P is weighted towards them. Calls in both double dips, but can see your money evaporate also. Buying tech sector puts and SPY calls makes no sense, for the exact same rationale unless it's a pure hedge against share value, or an isolated catalyst like a lawsuit or acquisition, in which case, it's probably going to pull the ETF/index down or up with it anyway. The best way to double dip is to find complimentary positions. Example: Verizon on top of Apple is good - if their streaming service is good and requires iPhone hardware, the market may see a boost in iPhone sales from Verizon and ATT, etc. Corresponding plays.\n\n# Will You Cover This Ticker/Give Me Your Thoughts On This?\n\nIf you've got something you are eyeing, I'll occasionally be willing to offer my thoughts on the company and the underlying. **I can not, and will not tell you when to enter/exit/buy/sell any stock or option,** however. I will simply say what I think about the specific ticker and their outlook. Once again, it is simply **my opinion and not advice.** **If you ask for a ticker overview, include the ticker symbol with a $, like $AAPL,** so I can just search the thread for them. I probably won't go over them all and likely already have my thoughts on many, but I'll try to reply with thoughts on many. The threads will get longer week by week, and so try to understand if I don't get to all of them. Below is a list of stocks I won't cover, and it will grow week by week. If you ask me specifically for advice on your own position, or situation, I'll simply ignore your comment. This warning is all over the thread. \n\n**Stocks I won't cover or comment on (because they're just too ridiculous):** This week, none\n\n**BEFORE YOU ASK FOR A TICKER:** Lots of people ask for the same thing, I don't mind adding color commentary on specifics if you have a question about a certain aspect of the company, but please just load all the comments and CTRL+F (CMD+F for Mac) and look for that ticker to see if there's a conversation going on about it already.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Private Messages/Chat Requests:** I'll likely ignore most of these. I got like four hundred last week? I trade during the day, so I can't be bothered to be responding thoughtfully when I have 15 charts on my screen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "created_utc": 1554687091, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/banrt4/i_pick_options_so_you_dont_have_to_week_beginning/", "is_self": true}
