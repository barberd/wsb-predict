[Update]", "selftext": "My original post is here\n\nBasically, I got a Payday loan today at EasyMoney store near my house. I saw the market was down and bought a ton of AMD call options when it was down 5%. I was hoping that it would rebound near market close but it didn't so I did not get my account up to the 2k required for Robinhood margin investing. \n\nThe market is so low right now that I need to buy more option calls so I can pay off my 1st payday loan and secure a margin account to even make more money. It's pretty obvious that the market is about to turn around because it dropped so hard today. Everyone knows this.\n\nSo my question is do places that give pay day loans communicate with each other? Like can I go to several loans at different payday places in Alabama? I've already been to EasyMoney but I haven't been to Check n' Go or Advance America yet. Once I have enough capital in my account I can turn on margin investing and buy calls at market open tomorrow. If not I don't know what I'm going to do.\n\nHere's what I currently own btw \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/qxBXjub", "created_utc": 1557785245, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/boa0o7/can_i_take_out_multiple_payday_loans_to_secure/", "is_self": true}
