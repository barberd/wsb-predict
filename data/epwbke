{"id": "epwbke", "title": "Long WMT?", "selftext": "&gt;WMT has flat-lined the past month due to low earnings reports in Q4.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I've held WMT for \\~5-10% of my IRA for the past year and have enjoyed consistent returns until about Xmas time.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;News articles say 2019 had amazing holiday season sales. To me it appears WMT is growing both online sales and retail operations at a breakneck speed which no other B&amp;M retailer can keep up with. With the exception of Q4, they consistently deliver good earnings and have never scaled back on offering a decent dividend. (which is especially attractive when other stocks might appear overvalued in year 10 of a bull market).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Am I missing something?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Why has WMT lost steam?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Is this the ATH which investors should avoid?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Or possibly a dip before a long term run up?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Or is walmart the perpetual \"buy and hold\" stock which will only start to see gains when bears start looking for value?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I just bought a couple of WMT 30 day calls thinking this is a temporary dip, should I buy more?", "created_utc": 1579240557, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/epwbke/long_wmt/", "is_self": true}
