{"id": "gapprn", "title": "Gotham's Reckoning - How Jerome Is Cucking Asset Markets", "selftext": "I'll make this quick. I work for a privately owed commercial REIT in NYC and 95% of our retail tenants could not pay rent last month. Why does this matter? Well this evening I had a realization that I'd like to share with you. The following explains how Jerome's Printshop has the exact opposite effect on Main St and is like throwing a bowling ball to help someone who's drowning. Here we go:\n\nCommercial real estate was fucked before CV bc Jerome's QE antics have been artificially inflating asset prices for years (equities, real estate). Look at the steep increase of the SP500 over the past 4 years. Look how many people were talking about a market crash due to the Jerome Print BEFORE CV was even a thing.\n\nThe problem is that everyone refinanced their commercial mortgages and now have these insane monthly payments to make. \n\nEveryone blames Amazon for empty retail stores and small biz closing up shop, but it's really The Jerome Printshop's fault bc his policies inflate real estate (and stonk) prices, which detaches them from reality--and becomes evident in real world, elastic marketplaces where price is based on supply, demand, and scarcity (like real estate).\n\nSmall businesses that pay rent have to use real money earned from sales to cover the inflated costs of rent, which was already tough for many of them to do. I'm sure you've noticed a bunch of empty stores in your town before CV even began.\n\nSo when businesses reopen there will be even more Owners who will struggle to make ends meet (or not even attempt to reopen) because the fixed costs are locked in at high prices. And bc consumers feel that their future source of income for the next year or two has been seriously threatened by CV, nobody will be spending crazy money like Jeromey Romey Rome thinks.\n\nAs you can see, I was a bit early on this one w my picks, but there's no doubt in my mind that shit will hit the fan in the next 3 months.\n\n\n\n\nSPY\n\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF TRUST...\n\n29 APR 20 230 P 100 (Weekly.. +5\n\n1 MAY 20 250 P 100 (Weeklys) +10\n\n4 MAY 20 280 P 100 (Weeklys) +5\n\n6 MAY 20 274 P 100 (Weeklys) +14\n\n6 MAY 20 279 P 100 (Weeklys) +2\n\n13 MAY 20 280 P 100 (Weekly. +4\n\n30 JUN 20 279 P 100 (Quarts. +1\n\n17 JULY 20 235 P 100 +5\n\n17 JULY 20 238 P 100 +5\n\n18 SEP 20 237 P 100 +5\n\n30 SEP 20 240 P 100 (Quarts. +2\n\n16 OCT 20 250 P 100 +1\n\n18 JUN 21 390 C 100 +2\n\nUSO UNITED STATES OIL FU. 15 JAN 21 7 C 100", "created_utc": 1588224482.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gapprn/gothams_reckoning_how_jerome_is_cucking_asset/", "is_self": true}
