{"id": "e0lo6i", "title": "TSLA Flaunts First China-Built Cars As Start of Sales Nears... so you shouldn't give a crap about the batmobile", "selftext": "Yall r so focused on the batmobile which has nothing to do with longterm prospects of TSLA and forget that TSLA about to have a killer quarter in China. China's TSLA equivalent basically disappeared (forgot its name lol) so now its just TSLA and TSLA only for EVs in China which is great cuz China embarking on ambitious switch to 100% EVs by 2035 or some shit. Now i dunno when yall puts gonna b expiring but just remember when these sales start popping yall returns be droppin\n\nThose tsla bears always tryna scare you into selling but trust the biz model mi amigos not the chatter. once those chyna sales go crazy + tsla introduces cheaper sedans/suvs in us mid 2020, tsla goin right back up +10\\~15%. Trust the Buffet beast when he says \"go long son\"\n\n**Oh and before yall tsla bears come at me** with the whole \"but...but...BUT FORD HAS ELECTRIC VEHICLES NOW TOO... tHeY cAn seLL iN cHiNA tOo...th..they...they will eAT uP tSLa's mArKEt pOSiTIon iN tHe US\" lemme just say, have you ever even ridden a TSLA my guy? Tsla model prices pretty much = ford ev prices, but owning a tsla is the shit and owning a ford means your still prolly a virg. That's ok tho same here. Anyway, point is, tsla is not dying in domestic market just becuz all the copycats now entering EV market. Tsla gonna still kill it in US, double digit sales growth. And now, they're about to consensually fuck the bejeezus out of china and europe. git reddddddddddy for the muskkkkkkkk\n\n[https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-sedans-china-cars-elonmusk/](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-sedans-china-cars-elonmusk/)", "created_utc": 1574533015, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e0lo6i/tsla_flaunts_first_chinabuilt_cars_as_start_of/", "is_self": true}
