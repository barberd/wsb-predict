{"id": "fq00g3", "title": "Event 201: A global pandemic exercise", "selftext": "In October, 2019 the Gates Foundation teamed up with the World Economic Forum and the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security to enact what they called a \u201cfictional\u201d scenario simulation involving some of the world\u2019s leading figures in public health. It was titled Event 201. Here's the video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoLw-Q8X174](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoLw-Q8X174)\n\nAs their website describes it, Event 201 simulated an \u201coutbreak of a novel zoonotic coronavirus transmitted from bats to pigs to people that eventually becomes efficiently transmissible from person to person, leading to a severe pandemic. The pathogen and the disease it causes are modeled largely on SARS, but it is more transmissible in the community setting by people with mild symptoms.\u201d\n\nIn the Event 201 scenario the disease originates at a pig farm in Brazil, spreading through low-income regions and ultimately explodes into an epidemic. The disease is carried by air travel to Portugal, the USA and China and beyond to the point no country can control it. The scenario posits no possible vaccine being available in the first year. \u201cSince the whole human population is susceptible, during the initial months of the pandemic, the cumulative number of cases increases exponentially, doubling every week.\u201d\n\nThe scenario then ends after 18 months when the fictional coronavirus has caused 65 million deaths. \u201cThe pandemic is beginning to slow due to the decreasing number of susceptible people. The pandemic will continue at some rate until there is an effective vaccine or until 80-90 % of the global population has been exposed.\u201d", "created_utc": 1585326415.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fq00g3/event_201_a_global_pandemic_exercise/", "is_self": true}
