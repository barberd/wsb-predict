In my albeit limited clinical experience with compassionate use remdesivir, I have gotten the general impression that it improves outcomes at least in the critically ill population. In light of today's Statnews development, I took to the data to determine whether the numbers really are on GILD's side.\n\nI reviewed all available large case series from Pubmed and Medrxiv to develop a very basic meta-analysis*. In total, 9 studies were reviewed, including Richardson, Grasselli, Wang, Guan, Paranjpe, and Yang to develop a cohort of controls, and compiled data from Grein, Kujawski, UChicago, and WHO's most recent leak to comprise the intervention arm of the meta-analysis.\n\nPOOLED CONTROL COHORT (Death Rate / Total Hospitalized)\nRichardson (291 / 2634)\nGrasselli (405 / 1591)\nWang (6 / 138)\nGuan (15 / 1029)\nParanjpe (313 / 1078)\nYang (32 / 710)\nTotal = 1062 / 7180\n\nPOOLED REMDESIVIR COHORT (Death Rate / Total Hospitalized)\nGrein (7 / 53)\nKujawski (0 / 3)\nUChicago (2 / 125)\nWHO (22 / 158)\nTotal = 31 / 339\n\nIn total, 1,062 patients out of 7,180 in the pooled control cohort died (consistent with the estimated 18.8% mortality rate cited by CDC currently), compared to 31 out of the 339 in the collection of remdesivir trials (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.43-0.90), implying an effect even taking into consideration today's update.\n\nThere are obvious limitations here. First, there was no way to control for APACHE scores (level of clinical severity) among trials, and hospitalization causes vary widely among healthcare systems; these studies were collected from China, Italy, and the United States, each in different timepoints of the outbreak curve, which may necessitate different admission rates. This is somewhat reflected by wide variance in intubation rate (45-85%), a surrogate marker for severity in this case. Additionally, this data relies on the two reported deaths from UChicago's cohort of 125 patients treated with remdesivir; this may skew mortality downward as clinical courses are not yet complete. Lastly, inpatient mortality data from the included Chinese studies (Wang, Guan, Yang) is significantly lower than that published by most public health agencies (4 vs 18%), suggesting a within-study skew toward lower mortality in the control arm.\n\nMore data is obviously required before meaningful clinical guidelines will support remdesivir, but ultimately, despite the extremely wide confidence intervals and important methodological limitations here, I suspect the data reflect a mortality effect at least in the critically ill population.\n\nTLDR: GILD 5/29 $90C\n\nELI5: GILD took a dip today on a Statnews report that a small prospective cohort study found no clinically significant benefit to remdesivir in treating COVID-19 patients. Top-line data from main tranche of clinical trials are pending, but remdesivir production is ramping up globally on hopes that it will be shown to have at least a moderate effect. I felt that today\u2019s data were not in line with the clinical experience we have had, and conducted a heavily-caveated meta-analysis to check this hypothesis. This analysis supports increasing positions in GILD on market reaction to this downturn.\n\nELI1: BTFD", "created_utc": 1587672142.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6tqvs/thats_fine_but_remdesivir_probably_works/", "is_self": true}
