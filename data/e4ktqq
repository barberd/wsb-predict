{"id": "e4ktqq", "title": "CRSP Investing &amp; DD", "selftext": "I\u2019ve owned CRSP stock since January 2019, and 12/20 $80 Calls since November 20th. I expect the stock to continue on its recent surge pass December, have a correction January/February 2020, and continue on a long-term upward trend for the next 3+ years.\n\nWhen it comes to gene-replacement, there aren\u2019t very many options. You can either use Crispr, or modified viruses. The difference is similar to \u201ccutting\u201d &amp; \u201cpasting\u201d with a scalpel, versus exploding &amp; inserting with a bomb. Modified viruses have been around for decades, but Crispr is the newest tech in this field.\n\nThe biggest thing holding back gene-modification isn\u2019t actually our technological advancements, it\u2019s our understanding of the human genome. The Human Genome Project started in 1990, in order to categorize all of human DNA sequencing, and it still has a long way to go. A \u201csimple\u201d thing like eye color isn\u2019t just in 1 place of your DNA, but is in several dozen places &amp; the regions vary based on the individual. With increasingly better computing &amp; AI, we\u2019ve gotten better at understanding all of human DNA &amp; where to alter it.\n\nGene-editing has just begun, and it isn\u2019t going away. People will alter their sequencing for both necessity &amp; personal preferences in the future, and there will be a lot of money to be made in it. I recommend all long-term investors to hold some shares of CRSP, and I welcome short-term traders to ride the wave where they see potential to do so.", "created_utc": 1575222895, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e4ktqq/crsp_investing_dd/", "is_self": true}
