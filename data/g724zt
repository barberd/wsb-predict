The shelves were full of easter candy still and had a sign that said 50% off all easter candy. I went again yesterday and the shelves were still full this time the sign said 75% off. The easter baskets and other stuff was 90% off and still fully stocked. [Look even Staples is trying to sell it 50% online](https://slickdeals.net/?adobeRef=9320c1d485e411ea894a8e47b639583f0001&sdtrk=catpagev2&afsrc=1&trd=See%20Deal&sdtid=14003921&tid=14003921&pv=9327eaae85e411ea894a8e47b639583f&au=48e53c1285e411eaa40bf2b6c0bebaaf)\n\n\\-The next big candy holiday is halloween, which is a big social contact holiday. Of course 3rd quarter is the biggest for Heresy halloween. Parents are already paranoid about letting their kids eat halloween candy \"check it for razors, drugs, and posion.\" You think they're gonna let their kids eat possible coronacandy or worse contact it from door to door.\n\n\\-The park. Just like Disney. Hershey has a rollercoaster theme park called Hershey park. It has a stadium for concerts. COVID is destrorying summer events.\n\n\\-Vending machines - vending machines are often own by small time investors as a side hustle. They place them in convient stops that are now closed to the public. Sales to vending machines is going down the toliet.\n\nNow tell me how HSY is only 14% off all time highs, when DIS is down 30%", "created_utc": 1587703622.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g724zt/hershey_halloween_is_canceled_due_to_social/", "is_self": true}
