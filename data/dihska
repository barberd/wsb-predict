{"id": "dihska", "title": "Democrats and never Trumpers want chaos with Hong Kong", "selftext": "Trump just wants peace and quiet going into the 2020 elections.  The Democrats and neocon never Trumpers want war in Syria.  They want US intervention in Hong Kong.  They want things to implode in 2020.  I can tell China just wants to get the world out of their business concerning Hong Kong, and I guarantee that Trump wants nothing to do with creating conflict with China now with the elections coming up.  I think we could have serious potential for a serious market meltdown probably starting some time in the middle of next year.  The billionaire globalists are all going to sell down the market bigtime in order to get people scared.  Especially if Biden or Hillary gets the nomination, I think it's going to be a big bear crash in order to discredit Trump's economy.  The Google CEOs, Bezos, Zuckerberg, Gates, etc. are going to be coordinating an attack on the financial markets in order to screw with Trump.  All this rhetoric coming out of AOC, Pelosi, and Schumer about Hong Kong is fake.  They would be back in love with their Chinese masters if Hillary or Biden takes the reign.", "created_utc": 1571188429, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dihska/democrats_and_never_trumpers_want_chaos_with_hong/", "is_self": true}
