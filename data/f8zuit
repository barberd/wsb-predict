{"id": "f8zuit", "title": "GRPN DD", "selftext": "On 2/19 GRPN fell more than 40% from \\~3$ to $1.80. This is due to their physical stores not doing so well, but who actually leaves their house to go to a store? The only time i've used groupon is to get some sweet deals on pizza (delivery of course). Now they're getting rid of the huge cash sink that is their physical stores and they go down 40%, makes no sense. Now they're going back to the old plan of selling \"experiences\" (aka rafting trips for Becky and Chad).\n\nNow with the mexican beer virus, its dropped another 7%. If there's anytime to buy its now, GRPN is severely undervalued and it will recover back to $2+ once people stop freaking out about the virus.", "created_utc": 1582584719, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f8zuit/grpn_dd/", "is_self": true}
