Tard buy and make big tendies with extra hunny mussy. 5/15 $45/50c\n\nAlright you retards now that all of you have your dicks hard about crude storage companies it's time to take a look at Magellan. Now I've had my sights set on this company every since oil started to take a shit on my grandmother's chest and I can tell ya they're looking awful fine. Around 45% of their assets are based around moving and storing crude oil. And better yet their stock has yet to actually pop from the dip. They're still down around 45% from their ATH. Now don't get me wrong a good bit of their income is gonna get fucked by lack of demand for refineries. However they have the mainland US of A cucked into submission with their pipelines and storage facilities. Now what does that mean for us degenerates? It means if any rich fucks with storage facilities in mid bumfuck US want to store some free crude they have to pay MMP to ship/temporarily store it. Bottom line is they are going to post pretty good earnings thru all of this shit and it has not been \"priced in\" yet. God saying that makes me wanna spread my cheeks and let jpow himself fuck my gay ass. Anyway for all of you that can't read here are some positions. \n$MMP 5/15 $45c\n7/17 $50c", "created_utc": 1587840627.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7yz0f/lets_talk_mmp/", "is_self": true}
