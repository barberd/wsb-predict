There are people on WSB that think Nikola will be the next Tesla, and there are also people that think it will never produce a vehicle. Frankly you are entitled to your own opinion and I don't really care what it is.\n\nHowever that being said I'm sure you are aware of the stonk, and are probably annoyed you missed the initial rally from circa 30 to 65 with a high of 90?  \n\nNow if you had the patience to monitor the stonk for just a few weeks you would know that today is the day they are taking pre-orders on some of their products. The CEO was on CNBC on Friday blowing the Nikola trumpet.\n\nHe will no doubt post the figures of pre-orders this week. Even a slightly healthy pre-order book at a price tag of USD 75,000 for the badger will make the stonk rally?", "created_utc": 1593432770.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hhyqko/missing_an_open_goal_nkla/", "is_self": true}
