{"id": "egz0wi", "title": "FREE MONEY x3 ?", "selftext": "So I just learned about leveraged ETFs from [u/Throwaway54275](https://www.reddit.com/user/Throwaway54275/) post and I had my mind blown. Everybody knows that stonks/the market always goes up, but not as fast as you autists might want them to. Which then leads to more riskier option trading in hopes for grander and faster tendies. The opposite to this would be to hold SPY or other ETFs long term to guarantee profits, although them being relatively small. So I did some googling to try and see why no one from r/investing is using leveraged etfs to triple their small balls risk free profits.\n\nBut I still see no downsides to leveraged ETFs, why would anyone choose to not take 2/3 (if its x3) of their tendies?  It is essentially free money just sitting on the table because etfs always go up in the long run and therefore it is nearly impossible to lose money on them if you were born with the correct amount of chromosomes. \n\nWhy wouldn't anyone holding SPY choose to triple their gains without any risk?", "created_utc": 1577580480, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/egz0wi/free_money_x3/", "is_self": true}
