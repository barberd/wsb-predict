Facebook, but user count is too high. \n2. Microsoft, what we know, they did have an office 365 outage and that there current office user base is [1.2billion](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+many+people+use+microsoft+office&amp;rlz=1C1SQJL_enUS860US860&amp;oq=how+many+people+use+microsoft+office&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.6807j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8)[This](https://twitter.com/helpnetsecurity/status/1197069655619375104) 1.19 billion medical documents leaked, now this doesn't seem to be related but could be connected although the data was stored on unprotected [PACS servers](https://www.osirix-viewer.com/resources/pacs/). \n3.

The exploit would allow for everyone's iPhone to give live updated information on their GPS position every 60 seconds. \n4.  Google google chrome has an exploit over but most have seemed to have been patched. \n5. Amazon really not that much maybe AWS although this would have been a much bigger breach since a good portion of our internet is hosted on AWS including some Netflix and apple. \n6. This could also be Visa looking at the Macy that stole information Visa currently has 3.3 billion cards out [source](https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/download/corporate/media/visanet-technology/aboutvisafactsheet.pdf)\n7. Mastercard well maybe doesn't seem [likely](https://www.statista.com/statistics/618137/number-of-mastercard-credit-cards-worldwide-by-region/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease say what are your thoughts and opinions if we find the answer together this could be a big win for all of us. \n\nmy top 2 choices are 1.
