I've been reading up on it and the pass rate on the 3 exams are all under 50%, with a recommendation of 300 hours of studying for each one. Realistically, I'd be looking at 1000+ hours of studying over 3 years, plus thousands of dollars in fees and textbooks, all assuming I passed each of the tests on the first try.
