So i want to share the DD i dove into. \n\nI first dove into the coronavirus back in late jan maybe early feb when I came across this post. https://www.bestgore.com/medical/video-relate-corona-virus-outbreak-wuhan-china/\nIt was very interesting to see INO in the article because since  December I was wanting to get some cheap shares. lol any way fast forward 2 months and a drop later I believe we have another opportunity. \n\nPretty much in short terms without a long narrative. PFE the American company will most likely get a government contract to help produce the necessary zithromycin for the masses. They say it's important for the cocktail with hydroxychloroquine (less toxic than chloroquine) and well I believe it. Aside from the high skepticism due to some flaws and irregular measures other countries are still in favor of using it along with USA (Trials in NYC, Minnesota and most likely recently i think Connecticut). \n\nPreviously this combination has shown some promise in February by the Chinese, most recently the article released March 19 in France, and lastly India a country most recently hit with a spike has banned exports of it. Although publication wise the combo still needs to be given guidelines and some literary backing ground docs in NY, OR, NJ, and TX have already been prescribing and tout about it's success within 24-48 hours. Maybe around Wednesday there was about a 3:1 death rate. with recoveries as low as 300. Now there is a sudden spike. I speculate this is either from hospitals releasing numerous patients at a time after awaiting for COVID-19 results or the medicine that started circulating last week is actually having an effect. As of today, CNN released news mentioned guess but not least Bill Gates ready to start trials of this combo in NY through the Gates Foundation. Guess who he is also invested in through the foundation? INO\n\nI pretty much suspect a pump in the market at some point (so much money gonna be injected in general) before easter that it makes $SPY jump at least to 275 and maybe news like this can carry it to 300. Lately PFE has been getting some interesting price action. Showing some strength when SPY sells off and clear support with dip buyers including me even in option contract i think. \n\nMy positions are 36C 4/17 and 32C 5/15.  I was actually gonna trim some of my 32C on friday but I accidently bought one at 1.74 lmao. I should of given myself more time for those 36C but fudge it i'm balls deep compared to my account after averaging down from .50.  \n\nStorytime: This is coming from a guy that bought RCL 100 P 3/20 @ 113 and sold early. This time ima diamond hand these until they either make me rich or expire worthless. My account is also bull flagging. \n\nPosition + All Time: https://imgur.com/a/iSCsabI\n\nAm I a retard?\n\nEdit: PFE also is offering a note worth 1.25 B maturing by 2030. Honestly I have no idea what this means but I suspect something behind the scenes is occurIng. America is all about insider right?\nhttps://newsfilter.io/a/32136d94bef0423fb095a33b91748b8d\n\nEDIT 2: IDK why but my post is taking forever to load up. But Trump just said quarantine is not necessary in NYC. I\u2019m speculating he knows something we don\u2019t. *clears throat* \n\nEdit 3: old geezers are now recovering ayee? https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/fqrlj9/my_neighbour_joe_returning_home_from_hospital_now/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/fqwind/after_11_hospital_days_and_losing_12kg_my_78yr/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf", "created_utc": 1585450936.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqylcb/long_pfe_a_daddy_musk_donnie_pump/", "is_self": true}
