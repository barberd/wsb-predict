Fresh eggs not like that lab grown danced on McDonald's shit.  \n\nThey asked me to tell my friends and family about their new breakfast food.  Makes sense cause I was the only one there at 7:30 am.  I didn't even know if they were open honestly.  Whichever VPs gambled on this thing probably have the $ROPE and rickety chair ready because success is far from certain.\n\nLast time they tried it failed horribly. \n\nWhat this means to me is an opportunity.  No one knows about the gold yet. It's not priced in. Fellas, when people find out this shit will spread like wild fire \ud83d\udd25 and that long as line of overworked wage slaves at MCD in the morning waiting for their Frankenfood will soon be parked in front of Wendy's. \n\nWendy's breakfast is fucking recession proof and since I don't have any real friends or family to tell I'm letting you retards know.
