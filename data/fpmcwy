Some of you have lost wives and spouses to their boyfriends. Everybody here has lost something at some point throughout this black market rally due to JPow having liquid nitrogen coolant in the money printer. \n\nTomorrow, I am liquidating 70% of my puts and going into calls... for you my fellow autists. I will die on this hill for the tendies to fill your pockets. As soon as I buy calls, you will see a deep red fill the sky and the dildo on your screen. \n\nAs you watch the markets tank, I hope you find elation similar to your childhood prior to being touched by your uncle.", "created_utc": 1585266113.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpmcwy/my_fellow_bears/", "is_self": true}
