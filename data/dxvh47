{"id": "dxvh47", "title": "AMRN pump opportunity", "selftext": "On Friday AMRNs only product got a unanimous approval from the FDA to expand their label. This caused the stock price to jump over a key resistance level. The stock has a short float of 36% and I believe these shorters stop losses are slightly above the previous close. If we all pump the stock, we can hit the shorters stop losses and cause a massive jump in buyer volume pumping the stock even higher. If we all collectively chip in 20 dollars to buy one share we can definitely pump it up to 30 dollars once the bears cut losses.", "created_utc": 1574037665, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dxvh47/amrn_pump_opportunity/", "is_self": true}
