AOBC will continue to sell doomsday prepper boxes of dehydrated semen to boomers, whereas SWBI will rake in all the profits from their various weapons of peace and American prosperity.\n\nDD\n\n* Gun Background checks rose 80%, 62% and 75% for March, April and May respectively. S&W is one of the most recognizable firearms brands in the world, so we can assume a good chunk of those checks were to purchase some shiny new gats.

Since \"atm\" starts with A and since Smith and Wesson has an I in it, we can assume that any calls we buy are going to be ITM.\n* S&W also announced they're gonna have an earnings conference on 6/18 after hours. This isn't reflected in the nottingham app yet so all the other non-retarded retail investors don't know about it, they're just blindly buying gun stocks because guns are cool.

Can buy the dip now and collect your tendies in a week.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x9yyb8zyni251.png?width=888&format=png&auto=webp&s=f08b9885ef22449b3f33ff539111f8f2b0bc81f6\n\n* As we all know, stonks only go up. If you follow the laws of WSB and blindly FOMO in now, logic dictates that the stonk will go up and all your hard earned duckets you collect from working at Chic-Fil-A will increase x-fold. Below I've included the above chart but with my actual projections based on 30 minutes of research and 1 month of swing trading experience.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9wi7n760oi251.png?width=856&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c2c08230303f720559893a7b2acfe91cae2f57c\n\nPlay the run up to earnings, sell before or after earnings idk, I'm retarded as fuck you should definitely listen to me.\n\nPositions or ban:\n\n6/19 20c, 18c, 17c.", "created_utc": 1591112263.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gv9ilv/swbi_is_the_play/", "is_self": true}
