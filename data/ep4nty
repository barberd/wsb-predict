{"id": "ep4nty", "title": "Letter from a real Bear", "selftext": "The bear shaming on this thread is hilarious, but I wanted to make sure fellow autists know how actual traders short the market. \n\nReal traders are not buying 16 delta SPY puts waiting to cash out on a 50x return so they can buy a realistic fuck doll for their basement lair. Real traders are not position max short futures blowing out their account every month on new highs on their way back to work at Northwestern Mutual.   \n\n\nReal bearish traders are shorting all those AMD calls you idiots bought last week. Real Traders are scalping futures short after pump moves and covering quickly. Real traders are short Russell and Dow many times over their long ES/NQ futures positions.   \n\n\nBeing bearish is not about making 10000% on a lucky options bet. It's about making a small amount of money on the way down so you can buy at lower prices with more money on the way up.   \n\n\nIf you can't make money in both directions, you're not a trader.", "created_utc": 1579106624, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ep4nty/letter_from_a_real_bear/", "is_self": true}
