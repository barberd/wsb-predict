You can check that out, but for now let\u2019s get to CHGG.\n\nThink of CHGG as an online interactive education tool with built in services \u2014 the picture then becomes clearer.\n\n1)  With everything that\u2019s going on with corona, schools not opening (physically) in August will soon become apparent.  We won\u2019t have to wait on schools to announce what we already know.  \n\n2)  Chegg has 2 \u201ccompetitors\u201d who shan\u2019t be named because it\u2019s not even a competition.  A little research shows that those business models suck compared to CHGG.  \n\n3)  Every school in the USA that can do remote education will \u2014 especially the colleges.  There will be some dumb ass states/counties that try to go about school the \u201cnormal\u201d way.  That would quickly backfire as virus flares much higher in early fall \u2014 and very few administrators would be willing to take that projected risk.\n\n4)  CHGG has been growing like a fucking beast since it\u2019s IPO, just check the charts.  It was a growth stock before this major catalyst.\n\n5)  Subscriptions are $13-$20 per month.  Because of this low price point and learning from home, I expect the majority of college kids to subscribe once they become aware of all the benefits.\n\n6)  Textbook rentals, e-textbooks, personalized learning programs, practice exams, and the big one \u2014 tutoring!  At only at $20/hr.  \n\n7)  Recent strategic partnership that expands their resource networks and increases profit margins.\n\n8)  I may be early on this play.  But as soon as schools not operating physically becomes a hot topic, this will become THE stock to park money.\n\n9)  In the first 5min of after hours yesterday, 480k shares were bought.  The total volume for the day was 4mil.\n\n10)  Look at the relative strength of both PTON and CHGG during this sell off.  These are the names money will rebalance into heading into Q3\n\n11)  Open interest is fairly light, this implies that people have yet to pile in.  And that \u201cfall is priced in\u201d is nonsense\n\n12)  Check out the advancing positive volume and order block distribution \u2014 lots of accumulation during a sell off!\n\nThe majority of schools participating in remote learning through Fall of 2020 is not priced in here.  Don\u2019t kid yourself.  Just a week ago the consensus was the country will be plateauing in cases through summer heading into fall.  Well, this shit has suddenly accelerated at an alarming rate and has every public official doubting their previous plans.", "created_utc": 1593181549.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hg8jtt/where_to_put_your_money_over_the_weekend/", "is_self": true}
