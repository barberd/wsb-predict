{"id": "bvgest", "title": "Cracker Barrel DD", "selftext": "Warning: This DD is based entirely on past performance.\n\nLooking at the yearly charts, Cracker Barrel is pretty consistent in that in the span of one month, starting with a large dip, the first half it will dip anywhere from $9-20, then by the end of the month it will have recovered most of that dip and sometimes exceed it. \n\nStarting on May 22, Cracker Barrel has started another \u201clarge\u201d ($12) dip. \n\nWe are still pretty early in the start of this months dip, and this is not the type of stock to make major moves either way based on earnings which are expected 6/4. I expect this months trend to continue uninterrupted with a maximum drop of  around $20 (149) between now and June 21. I expect the stock to recover anywhere from half to the entirety of the total dip.\n\nOnce funding has been transferred to my broker between now and 6/6, I will take into account any movement by then and buy slightly OTM calls no higher than $155 with a 7/19 exp since I\u2019m not autistic enough for 6/21....yet. Calls will likely be sold NLT 6/25 or a decent gain.", "created_utc": 1559358616, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bvgest/cracker_barrel_dd/", "is_self": true}
