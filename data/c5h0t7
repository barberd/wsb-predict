(~\uffe3\u25bd\uffe3)~ It's my first time \ud83e\udd2b posting \ud83d\ude16 S-SO BE GENTLE O////O I'd b-bet on $AMD price falling. It's P/E is extremely high compared to other CPU/GPU manufacturers, its price is not even close to being reflective on its earnings \ud83e\udd28 A b-beta of 3.68 shows it is very volatile and due to being o-overvalued the price should quickly drop \ud83d\ude0a I think the hype about it is similar to that of NVDA back in 2018 when the price continued to go up even though it was overvalued and dropped from over 260 USD to below 140 USD in less than a month. (\u273f\u25e0\u203f\u25e0) The halvening of BTC next year may also lead to a decrease in GPU sales as people will begin to stop mining due to profits being almost nothing for anyone not using industrial power, demand for GPUs will go down.
