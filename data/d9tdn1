{"id": "d9tdn1", "title": "[DD] $ACB - Analyst Rating: YOLO", "selftext": "Good Afternoon Disciples, \n\nToday I will DD Aurora Cannabis.  Currently, the stock is trading a 4.75 per share and with \\~1B shares outstanding the market cap of the company is $4.75B. By any traditional fundamental this would be an egregious valuation as the company had annual revenue of \\~$400MM.  This 10X sales would seem extremely high, except with a 333% CAGR advertised by the company it will only take 3 years for the firms revenue to reach $14B.  (they can produce a gram of pot for $0.9 USD...I think street price is $20...thats a markup)\n\nAurora Cannabis \\[the company\\] is a leader in the Canadian market for medical and recreational cannabis.  It is well known among the world that Canadians are nice, and as a result their marijuana is nice as well.  Nice marijuana = a nice high, which is a desirable type of high.  According to the company investor presentations a dynamic growth strategy that involves branding, science, scaling, diversification, cost of production, innovation, distribution, and brands will be used to create this growth.  But more realistically the growth is going to come from acquiring companies.  This is evident in the six year old company already completing 40 acquisitions.  Acquisitions cost money, and since they've already acquired 40 companies I assume this means they have a lot of money, otherwise they may be running our of money.\n\nOne risk is that vaping will be banned, but fortunately the company has dry flower,  oils, soft gels, gel caps, edibles, and infused beverages that they can sell, so even though nobody is going to be able to vape any more (lol) the company is able to sell their product through a wide array of markets.  Also, they are committed to finding the best way to get high.  Rumor is that if you shoot the THC into your veins the high can last for up to a month.  \n\nWith all things considered I recommend risking it all and buying ACB stock \n\ns/ncerely\n\nGP32", "created_utc": 1569547837, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d9tdn1/dd_acb_analyst_rating_yolo/", "is_self": true}
