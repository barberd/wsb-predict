But it got price target raises from everyone so it didn't rise enough. It jumped 3% today off daily lows from 1 dude buying 7/17 calls so I asked myself why he would do this...

Place orders now it's already up another 3% in after hours.", "created_utc": 1582160235, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6krul/buy_svmk_calls_while_you_can/", "is_self": true}
