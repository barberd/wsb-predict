But it is sprinkled with some nice trade ideas (can't think of many). However, there is a lot of misunderstanding of anything macro (ie. SPY).\n\nCan we have a thread each day that is only SPY/SPX/ES related? Throw in the QQQs too. There are a few people in here who actually seem to understand the Fed's repo ops, Trump's ADHD and other major economic indicators. \n\nWhy? These tickets have the only large liquidity for options outside of APPL/BAC/AMZN/FB etc; a S&amp;P 500 Index/Futures only daily thread would be helpful for those doing intraday option trades, especially for those wanting to move to futures but too scared yet.\n\nStart below if you want.\n\nTL;DR: the title", "created_utc": 1576452691, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eb6m14/spyspxes_daily_megathread/", "is_self": true}
