{"id": "gdkre3", "title": "Why Chegg could be in trouble", "selftext": "While chegg earnings are at an all time high since students are at home now, chegg could be running into potential issues as seen by a current college student:\n\n1. Professors and academics hate when students use chegg. They post fake solutions to questions and they know what content is already out there. See the Rutgers MA135 cheating scandal and GA Tech\n2. Universities have always been aware of chegg but now are paying more attention to it. The Intellectual Property of the questions which professors give to students are usually owned by the professors themselves, the university or a 3rd party consulting firm that is hired to write questions. Chegg has already seen DMCA suits come at them over content and I expect more to come after this semester.

Finally, as teachers and schools start to think ahead, they will be writing new questions for tests and homework assignments which do not have any previous chegg solutions. A paid Chegg subscription is only valuable to a student as long as they benefit from answers which have been previously written. Students are more cautious over which answers are real and which are planted by professors. This could lead to students cancelling their paid subscriptions. \n\nNow Chegg could be saved if they invest in other companies (like they already did with EasyBib) but I expect Chegg to take a bit of a hit in the coming future.\n\nTL:DR: Chegg: great for students, bad for universities' profit margins", "created_utc": 1588628316.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gdkre3/why_chegg_could_be_in_trouble/", "is_self": true}
