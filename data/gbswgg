Thought it's a load issue, tried again a couple of times after. Friday the 24th was the deadline - still didn't work - so I submitted through a support note (all the details about affected orders, concisely and clearly).\n\nRobinhood replied YESTERDAY - almost a week after - asking me to send the error. Sent them. Today they're replying like \"oh it's too late, you missed the deadline bud\".\n\nQuote: \"sadly we didn\u2019t receive your submission before the form closed. I want to apologize again for any inconvenience you experienced because of the outage.\"\n\nWTF \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21 First they have an outage, then they trap you with a non-working form and deadline. Anyone else had the same issue?\n\nWhy does Robinhood have to be such assholes? Yeah, because money, I get it. But still.
