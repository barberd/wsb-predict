While this is political in nature, it's applicable to our investments: \n\n\\- Tomorrow is March 15. Rod Rosenstein announced 2-3 weeks ago that he would be leaving the DOJ.   \n\\- About six weeks ago Senator Chuck Grassley, Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he was expecting the Mueller report in \"early March\".   \n\\- Today, the lead prosecutor for the Mueller investigation, who put Manafort away, announced he was departing for a university teaching gig in New York.  \n\\- Attorney General Barr said last week he was expecting the report from the Mueller investigation \"anytime\"  \n\\- Nancy Pelosi has ruled out \"impeachment\" for President Trump, to the chagrin of her very Left leaning caucus\n\nIt is VERY possible the Mueller report drops tomorrow, March 15. As this may generate market volatility, depending on what's in the report, do you sell your calls (or up your puts) anticipating a possible pullback in the markets until they can better ascertain what's in it, assuming the report drops tomorrow?  \n\n\nThoughts?", "created_utc": 1552617090, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b19c5u/if_the_mueller_report_drops_tomorrow_march_15/", "is_self": true}
