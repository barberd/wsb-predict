Researchers, analysts and medias are talking about riding the Bull Market , gain as much as you can while in it. Fear are Greed rides the market. Are we being bullish to buy more which makes the market grow and when the stonks can't go any further up then fear comes and change the perception to Bearish and crash the market down? Who is driving this market crazy? Feds, media, millionaires, crazy trade wars, OR ...Or.. or autistic/retards like US! \n\nData shows that the market rises up to 300% to 500% or even 1000% during the melt up and then BOOM it crashes down. Which stocks can you rely on at this time? where can you invest more and take precautions when needed. Even though the markets are churning still most people aren't invested in stocks. When do we know it is a Melt up and the market it going to crash now? i am not saying rn , could happen or never happen too.. \n\nJust a thought !", "created_utc": 1579161297, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/epgatw/are_we_there_yet/", "is_self": true}
