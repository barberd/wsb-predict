{"id": "gnzi3h", "title": "United Natural Foods - Serving A Pandemic", "selftext": "**UNFI Food** \n\nCoronavirus has obviously shifted consumer behavior and the market has rewarded nearly all e-commerce companies. Shitty companies like Wayfair have gone on exponential runs based on the market\u2019s expectation of a continued shift in behavior. However, the market has not taken into account another sector that is due for serious growth: food wholesalers (UNFI). As Americans, we don\u2019t just fight over toilet paper. Grocery spending was up [27%](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/13/shoppers-shift-from-stockpiling-to-penny-pinching-at-the-grocery-store.html) in the week ending on May 3rd. Online grocery sales have also skyrocketed and are projected to grow to [40%](https://www.supermarketnews.com/online-retail/online-grocery-sales-grow-40-2020) in 2020. The growth in online grocery sales is obviously the result of COVID with 52% of consumers polled stating that 2020 was the first time they had purchased groceries online (see the ridiculous spike in APRN.)   \n\n**Where does UNFI come in?**\n\nUNFI provides its healthy, organic foods to Whole Foods which along with other grocery stores has seen [insane demand](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2020/04/17/coronavirus-demand-whole-foods-converts-some-stores-online-only/5141287002). It\u2019s very likely that even more Americans will choose healthier food options with the fear of sickness looming in the background. However, UNFI doesn\u2019t only provide healthy, organic food options. With its acquisition of Supervalu, it also has non-organic options and has become one of the largest food distributors in America. \n\n**Distribution**\n\nAs a wholesaler with now more than 58 locations (the result of Supervalue acquisition), UNFI is able to reach its retail partners quickly, giving it a leg-up from other competitors who are struggling with the supply chain.\n\n**Finances**\n\nThese guys were so excited to release their earnings result, they released a preliminary report and they crushed it. Adjusted per-share earnings are up 130% from 61 cents during the same time last year. Revenue for the quarter comes in 12% higher than the $5.96 billion reported in the fiscal third quarter of 2019. They also reported a net income of 88 million a 57% increase from the same period last year.\n\n**Risk**\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong it has spiked since the preliminary results, but is still well below its 52-week high and certainly has not seen better conditions than this for its business.\n\nI\u2019ve been looking at some of the analysts who cover the stock to see what they\u2019ve said. None of it is really relevant, Andrew Wolf of Loop Capital Markets (what a shitty name), gave UNFI a $14 dollar price target on fears that the Teamster Union was making demands regarding health benefits and were organizing a strike. There has been noise that Amazon might be pulling out of its contract with UNFI but that hasn\u2019t materialized. That was the major reason for the sell-off.\n\nI guess, the biggest risk, is the market mistakenly believing that with the re-openings that people will start returning to eat in restaurants and grocery store sales will dip. I don\u2019t really buy this. I think most consumers won\u2019t return to restaurants very quickly and many people will continue to use online grocery delivery etc until a vaccine is created. \n\nI think this is a pretty common sense play. As long as the market doesn\u2019t tank (which it probably should) we should be good. BJ's beat is another indication that I think we're in line for growth. I\u2019d go long all food wholesalers.\n\n6/19 20 C UNFI\n\nedit: The short float is 18% so if it runs, it could squeeze", "created_utc": 1590076815.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gnzi3h/united_natural_foods_serving_a_pandemic/", "is_self": true}
