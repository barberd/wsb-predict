Looking through the lens, I started to feel pretty gay and then a bull knocked my shit over.  It might have been a sign from /u/WSBGod. Anyways, this is what I saw. (I'll try to keep this simple)\n\nPivot points are price levels that average of significant values (High, Low, Open, Close).\n\nHere are the last pivot points from today's trading:\n\n**Daily Candle Pivot**\n\nResistance: 294.04\n\nPivot: 283.77\n\nSupport:  279.02\n\nPivot points are used to determine trend.  If the price goes convincingly below 283.77 (goes below and stays below with relative average volume)  this is meant to be bearish and vice versa. \n\n[Support and resistance beyond today's pivot point.](https://preview.redd.it/m1lih5no7xl41.png?width=2141&format=png&auto=webp&s=86d0016bc50f76a57732adbc3c4c83c647bba9af)\n\nThis is SPY on the daily chart for 5 years. The white line is \\~273.  It is a double bottom that we bounced off hard of, so expect resistance if we get close. This will be tough for bears to breach. The other support line that will be harder to break is the 254 level. \n\nFor resistance, 297.51 is the area where they will struggle.\n\nThe green circle at the bottom are bearish indicator events. 3 and 2  bearish moving average cross overs.\n\nFinally, net short utilization is 81% on SPY. This is kinda a recipe for disaster to the upside if something major were to happen, but basically everyone's betting this is gonna keep going down.\n\nTL;DR: Champs play volatility here. VXX 40C 4/17 April , VIRT 30C April,  for SPY i'd treat it like its range bound and haywire and just straddle it. I'd open SPY 260p  03/31 tomorrow and if that starts to pay and gets near the support, I'd start buying calls and cash in. \n\nMy pos are SPY 250p 03/31 VIRT 30C 04/17 SPSX 22C 04/17\n\nThey are not YOLOs, but I can link if your gay.", "created_utc": 1583881576.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fgn0yo/heres_some_more_spy_astrology_pivot_points/", "is_self": true}
