{"id": "hhp7ou", "title": "\"Livongo is the Amazon of Healthcare\" DD", "selftext": "Hello Autists,\n\nI bring to you a sleeper play that has been flying under the radar lately going from a stock in the $20s to a high of $79 last week. Everyone is talking about tech stocks like FSLY, DDOG, DOCU, or OKTA but I don't see enough posts about LVGO.  Why is Livongo set to rally for what I believe deserves to be a triple digit stock by the end of next year?\n\n================================================\n\nu/ceud DD 5 months ago:\n\n**Livongo Health (**[$LVGO](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=lvgo&ty=c&ta=1&p=d)**)**\n\n* A consumer digital health company with a vision to empower people with chronic conditions to live better through the combined power of technology, real-time personalized information, and support from their chosen care team.\n* The platform analyzes data to build a picture of a person\u2019s patterns, while dietitians and physiologists give them real-time advice about diet, medication and exercise by apps or text message. If a patient\u2019s blood sugar is dangerously low or high, a coach will call to warn them within 60 seconds. Inspired by how big tech companies personalize services and nudge people into certain behaviors, Livongo \u2014 short for living-on-the-go \u2014 started by treating diabetes, before moving on to hypertension, weight loss and mental health.\n\n**Why?**\n\n* Livongo provides a truly disruptive technology and they're targeting a massive TAM (total addressable market). 90% of the $3.5 trillion spent annually on healthcare is dedicated to people with chronic and mental health conditions -- this is only expected to increase.\n* It also just signed its [largest contract ever](https://www.businessinsider.com/livongo-lands-biggest-contract-yet-2019-10) for the US government, allowing it to provide its diabetes solution to 5.3M employees as part of the Federal Employee Health Benefits Platform starting in 2020. Launching at the start of 2020, the tool will be available to 5 million federal employees and their families \u2014 and Livongo is optimistic that the partnership will afford it 45,000 new members and a revenue boost of up to $60 million through 2021. That's a significant lift given that Livongo brought in a total of\u00a0[$68 million](https://e.businessinsider.com/click/18262001.4/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2VjLmdvdi9BcmNoaXZlcy9lZGdhci9kYXRhLzE2MzkyMjUvMDAwMTE5MzEyNTE5MTg1MTU5L2Q3MzEyNDlkczEuaHRt/5d233c18f730436f2414784fB050eba75)\u00a0in revenue in 2018, it reported in its S-1 filing.\n* LVGO's clients include 20% of the Fortune 500 (Target, Pepsi, Microsoft, Merck, and Citigroup) and boast a high retention rate of \\~96%. They reported a 121% YoY growth in Q3 2019 and continue to grow exponentially.\n* Livongo\u00a0and health kiosk startup\u00a0Higi\u00a0have teamed up for a new program that will bring a Livongo-branded on-stage program to nearly 500 retail pharmacies. Higi has smart health stations at more than 11,000 chain grocery stores and pharmacies sites around the country. They include major brands like Rite Aid, Walgreens, and Kroger.\n\nHere are excerpts I've taken from a recent video by Unrivaled Investing I found regarding LVGO:\n\nSource: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrYSCvjXICU&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrYSCvjXICU&feature=youtu.be)\n\n**What are they trying to solve?**\n\nOur Health care system currently is only designed for acute and emergent care and is not equipped to provide daily continuous feedback and guidance for patients. This leaves people with ineffective and non adherent care leading to less healthy outcomes that leads to more expenses for both the patient and insurance companies.\n\n**Adressable population:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kvimdd80bq751.png?width=1402&format=png&auto=webp&s=c99cf022695fc0ad2fc08adcb6f50c6a07976854\n\nThe majority of America has 34.2 million **Americans**\u2014just over 1 in 10\u2014have **diabetes. Mental illnesses** are common in the **United States**. Nearly one in five **U.S.** adults live with a **mental illness** (46.6 million in 2017). The number of **Americans** at risk for heart attacks and strokes just got a lot higher. An estimated 103 million **U.S.** adults have **high blood pressure**, according to new statistics from the **American** Heart Association. That's nearly half of all adults in the **United States**.\n\n================================================\n\n**People use Livongo because:**\n\n1. Livongo makes it easier for patients to monitor their members to manage their health and their supply logistics.\n2. They provide critical health \"nudges\" that are guardrails to prevent members from getting ill.\n3. Theres a community of health members available 24/7 to assist patients\n\n\"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of care\"\n\nA health nudge or a phone call can help a member who is diabetic who is trending towards hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia to avoid an expensive visit to the ER.\n\n**What Livongo offers employers:**\n\n1. Healthier and happier employees\n2. Lower health care costs for employees (over $1.9k in savings - 3x ROI in 3 Years)\n3. Healthier and happier employee means less sick time and Lower employee churn\n\n\\*This situation is a win-win-win for all sides = employers save money = employees save money and are healthier = Livongo grows In sales = company value increases and expands = happy stock holders\n\n\\*Client retention rate of 95%\n\n\\*Revenue growth of >110% in the past year\n\n\\*member growth rate increasing by the thousands in the past two years with last quarter being 100%\n\n**Expanding the moat:**  (all resources in one company for different health issues)\n\n1. Differentiated competitive offering\n2. One trusted counter party\n3. Cross selling = an even BIGGER addressable market the just diabetes and hypertension\n\nWhy this company is HOT:\n\n1. Offering a whole person perspective is a smart strategy\n2. They're building a proprietary health database with valuable insights that make it harder for new players to enter\n3. Livongo is building a strong value proposition and likely has years of strong revenue growth ahead of them\n\n================================================\n\nA Redditor's (u/friendless2) experience with LVGO I found 3 years ago from r/diabetes:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/5fxhzu/experience\\_with\\_livongo/](https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/5fxhzu/experience_with_livongo/)\n\nMy job has offered to pay for the monthly fee. Since it comes with **unlimited strips and lancets, it is saving me some of the costs of running a meter, and I can check anytime I feel like it instead of trying to limit myself to 5-6 times a day.**\n\nThe meter is a bit slower to start up than other meters. My previous meter was an Accu-Check Compact Plus, and it started quicker than the Livongo even with rotating the drum and outputting a strip.\n\nThe nice part about the Livongo, is **I don't waste strips when my backpack gets squished and the Accu-Check spits out a strip without my knowing.** Also the Livongo strips (so far, it's only been a month) seem to always wick the blood nicely, where the Accu-Check, I would get the occasional strip (1-2 out of 51) that would not wick up anything.\n\nThe automated upload is a bit slow if you ask me. But it beats having to enter the data into my iPhone by hand. There are some Bluetooth meters that could enter your data into an app on your phone automatically (One Touch has one).\n\nThe categories for the glucose numbers is not what I would expect. They have the before and after meal categories, which is fine, but no before bed or out of bed/middle of the night category, so these all get lumped under the No Meal or Other category.\n\nThe need to select how you feel or why you are out of range is weird. I am not sure what the value of this is. Why do I need to select \"I feel fine\" or \"I feel ill\" to submit my numbers?\n\nThere are limits that you can set, where if you are **below that limit then a nurse coach texts you on your registered phone.** They are nice, and are **willing to answer questions on diabetes (17 years experience answered them by now) or on the meter or web site (computer guy here, I can figure it out). I happen to have hit 38 twice this week, and both times I got pinged immediately. When I was at 48 the meter asked me if I want a coach to contact me. I said no.**\n\nOverall it is a nice meter. You can bypass some of the start up by not bothering to press the Power and Check BG buttons and just stick a strip in it. The strips are HUGE compared to the Accu-Check, but it seems to use the same or less blood, and as stated above they work well. The meter tracks your supplies and asks if you want more. Just tap Yes, and they ship you a set just before you start your last 50 strips. You can also order on their website.\n\nTh**e website is where you can get graphs and reports. The meter has the same data, but not the averages. You can export the data or print it for your Endo appointments.** You can also **email reports directly to them. You can also have others notified if you are low or high via SMS**.\n\nIt is saving me **$1300 a year** so I am keeping it.\"\n\n================================================\n\n**Catalyst to buy now**:\n\n[https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/cms-upcoming-medicare-payment-rule-to-include-proposals-to-expand-telehealth](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/cms-upcoming-medicare-payment-rule-to-include-proposals-to-expand-telehealth)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CMS: Upcoming Medicare payment rule to include permanent telehealth expansions**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Patients initially used virtual care as a necessity during the pandemic but are now demanding it for convenience.**\n\n**\"The patient trust barrier has been broken. There is no going back,\" said Brady, who serves as chief of staff to the deputy secretary and senior adviser to HHS Secretary Alex Azar. \"Telehealth is now the preferred method. People want this as the first site of care. We are seeing a demand from consumers.\"**\n\n**The surge in telehealth coincides with HHS' data-sharing regulations published in February that will give patients easier access to their medical records.**\n\n**\"It will be interesting to see how all this overlaps with interoperability,\" Brady said. \"When patients have access to data and you give them remote virtual care we will see how that combination will help people make better decisions to live healthier lives.\"**\n\n\\----------------\n\n[https://www.staffing.com/what-role-will-telemedicine-play-in-health-care-after-covid-19/](https://www.staffing.com/what-role-will-telemedicine-play-in-health-care-after-covid-19/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What Role Will Telemedicine Play in Health Care After COVID-19?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dr. Jonathan Wright**\n\n\"I think the vast majority of patients that we have worked with greatly appreciate it and prefer it. For a lot of people, especially if you're working, I take care of a lot of older patients that are retired, but for a working patient, you can just carve out 15 minutes to hop on your computer and do your visit. You don't have to drive into the doctor's office, you don't have to pay for parking and then wait in line to get in, or wait in the exam room. Then the doctor's running late and all those kinds of things. It's just, \"Hey, I just do my quick appointment and get it done and move on.\"\n\nThe other thing that has been wonderful is that, you know obviously, you can have more than one person on a telemedicine call, on a Zoom call, or a Team's call. So the patients' families, no matter where they are in the country, can join on the call as well. For someone that does cancer, and we're talking about different treatment options, it\u2019s so fantastic to be able to see the patient and then their three children in different spots on the call to participate. Then, we don't have the \u201clost in translation\u201d when the patient passes it on to their family, and everyone can as a group be more on board and help that person with the decision process.\n\n================================================\n\n**Excerpts from Livongo Health Inc (LVGO) Q1 2020 Earnings Call Transcript:** [**https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/cms-upcoming-medicare-payment-rule-to-include-proposals-to-expand-telehealth**](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/cms-upcoming-medicare-payment-rule-to-include-proposals-to-expand-telehealth)\n\n**\"** We entered 2020 with significant momentum. We outlined our strategy to deliver on our whole person approach by addressing multiple conditions through our core diabetes solution and growing hypertension, weight management, diabetes prevention, and behavioral health offerings on one integrated applied health signals platform, and we are delivering.\"\n\n\"...we believe remote monitoring is **rapidly becoming the new standard in health and care.** Livongo's connected technology allows our members to track vital signs of interest in maintaining health. We expect that the **ability for both personalized care, as well as broad population surveillance will become critical going forward as an early warning and monitoring system for the healthcare system at large and a way to efficiently deliver care to those who need it most exactly when and where they need it**.\"\n\nThere is no question in our mind that this pandemic has **accelerated a more extensive virtual care delivery model**. Remote monitoring is here to stay, and we expect it to become the standard of care for the most vulnerable and expensive populations. We've also been receiving feedback from highly respected and innovative HR and benefits professionals who believe that Livongo is **key to keeping their people healthy, while also saving money. And Livongo is unique in that we have detailed studies to prove that Livongo improves care, saves money, and provides a great member experience**.\"\n\n\"Livongo has a **significant opportunity to continue growing our member base**. Because of our virtuous business model, we believe the COVID-19 pandemic has only reinforced the value of the service we provide our members and clients. In the first quarter, we added a record 380 new clients, which takes us to 1,252 overall clients, which is up **approximately 44% quarter over quarter.** Member enrollment was ahead of expectations with over 328,000 Livongo for Diabetes members as of the end of the quarter.\"\n\n\"More importantly, we're being asked to **accelerate launches to deliver services to clients who wanted their most vulnerable populations protected sooner and taken steps to position Livongo well pass COVID-19**...This trend was already under way before COVID-19, but the **pandemic accelerates it. We expect that larger, multiproduct, well-capitalized organizations will have an increased advantage**. In March, we announced the Health Transformation Alliance, or HTA, and Welltok.\"\n\n\"Today, **Livongo is even more strongly positioned.** Increasingly, everyone is realizing that our remote monitoring solutions and our focus on the most critical, vulnerable populations are necessary to **support our members through this pandemic in the near term and longer term as the market continues to shift to a virtual care model.\"**\n\n================================================\n\nPrice target raised from $52 to $85\n\n[https://www.tickerreport.com/banking-finance/5818984/livongo-health-nasdaqlvgo-pt-raised-to-85-00-at-keycorp.html](https://www.tickerreport.com/banking-finance/5818984/livongo-health-nasdaqlvgo-pt-raised-to-85-00-at-keycorp.html)\n\n================================================\n\nMy opinion:\n\nI'm in the medical field and my family line currently has 15 doctors. From my perspective, our society is transitioning everything into the digital realm including medicine. Medicine is expanding to place more emphasis on home health, individualized medicine, and preventative care. The most important aspect of medicine is prevention. This is really great for Livongo since their target population comprises the vast majority of Americans and they're expanding internationally as well. In addition, they will be able to save insurance companies thousands of dollars in medical bills. The fact that we're incorporating Cloud + Medicine is just really hard to deny that this is the stepping stone for the future our health care in general. Teladoc utilizes the concept of remote care as well and their growth has been exponential besides the fact that they're not profitable yet just like Livongo. (Livongo said they will begin to be highly profitable by 2021). My family members use Telahealth every day and it is incredible how we're able to provide our medical expertise remotely. This makes it convenient for both healthcare providers and patients. I am slowing adding on to my position, right now I only currently own calls. I recommend looking deep into this company if it interests you as it did for me. I only see this company growing exponentially with their stock reaching triple digits by the end of next year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: **Livongo Health (**[$LVGO](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=lvgo&ty=c&ta=1&p=d)**) Current stock price: $74**\n\nA consumer digital health company with a vision to empower people with chronic conditions to live better through the combined power of technology, real-time personalized information, and support from their chosen care team.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy position currently: 12 $85 C 8/21", "created_utc": 1593388286.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hhp7ou/livongo_is_the_amazon_of_healthcare_dd/", "is_self": true}
