While my CVNA puts are going to expire worthless because people are buying cars in the future despite unemployment, I checked out barchart unusal option activities for some inspiration for calls. \n\nNext to the crazy amount of PGC puts are ET calls sorted by volume at 63K. Since I'm sick of puts, I decided to do my DD on ET instead. \n\n\n[Unusal activities today Apr 22nd](https://www.barchart.com/options/unusual-activity/stocks?orderBy=volume&orderDir=desc)\n\nJust like that, voila. ET apparently is following NAT, DHT, and STNG's footstep on finding innovative ways to store oil. Just when I was kicking myself for not being able catch the NAT ship, ET sends his UFO down from Pluto and welcome me with open arms. The best part is the low is at 4 dollars earlier this year, so the ship hasn't gone into booster phase yet. \n\nThe spaceship is warming up while ET phoned home.
