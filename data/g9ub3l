Autists, flush with new cash after devastating gay bear losses decide, \"this is it, storks only go up, YOLO it all on SPY 5/1 300c.\" Well you big dick bull autists, this is exactly what JPOW expected. Just as the market makers sell you the calls and you start to see modest +5%, +10%, +25% gains you hold thinking \"I figured this shit out, tendie town, cocaine, and hookers here I come.\" You close that night up 35% on your portfolio and go to sleep with a smile because your wife's boyfriend just let you suck his cock. You check futures in the morning, giddy as a teenage girl experiencing sex for the first time, and just like the teenage girl, BAM disappointment slaps you in the face. BLOOD RED, \"How did this happen you ask?\" Well Timmy, that was JPOW's plan all along and you have been nothing but a pawn getting free liquidity to the financial system before the inevitable collapse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTldr: SPY puts 5/15, SPXS $11 calls 6/19 (if you're extra gay and spicy)", "created_utc": 1588103848.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9ub3l/the_real_reason_behind_the_1200_stimulus_check/", "is_self": true}
