By after hours close the portfolio was \\~$750.\n\nEnter the shitshow that was RH on Monday, forcing me to hold my position with no changes for the entirety of the insane 3/2 rally. Monday ended with my SPY call up to $1,406.xx and me unable to close it, RH unable to auto-execute, and me without the capital to exercise my options: [https://imgur.com/a/0Ffv7ir](https://imgur.com/a/0Ffv7ir)\n\nFor a few hours, my position closed expired with no action and my account balance was down to $198.xx. \n\nAround 11:30pm Mountain Time I get a notification on my phone saying that my position has been \\*exercised\\*, despite me (definitely) not having sufficient funds. I wound up getting the full premium on the rally and found my account balance at $1607.94 all said and done. As a side note, this also really fucked with my portfolio history, related pic in the absolute idiocy that was my trading day today: [https://imgur.com/a/zhbhgQD](https://imgur.com/a/zhbhgQD)", "created_utc": 1583292410, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fd6uvf/how_robinhood_fucked_me_into_gainz_update/", "is_self": true}
