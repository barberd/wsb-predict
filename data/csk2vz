If you remember a few months back, ApexLegends was going to be the gold cow to cash in on the PUBG/Fortnite adolescent faggy gamer population and EA's stock went up from $80 to $110. Not only that, the developers on the reddit called their fanbase with fragile snowflake feelings freeloaders and asshats and whatever (not worse than what we call each other here). \n\nThis has not only killed the goose with the golden eggs, but probably helped to abort whatever freemium projects EA has down the line. Butthurt snowflakes would probably boycott, refuse to buy any packages, and set fire to their PC/XBOX/PS4 or whatever, and eventually stop playing the game. There is a natural death to many games, and EA just accelerated the death of AL. With no replacement soon and the probable aversion to it, EA will be hurt bad. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not that faggy to do outright puts, but would hedge this. I would outright buy shares of the index because who knows how much Donnie will pump, and short shares of EA. One of you guys can figure out the right spread to buy.", "created_utc": 1566234780, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/csk2vz/buy_spyqqq_sell_ea/", "is_self": true}
