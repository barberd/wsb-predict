{"id": "g4edq1", "title": "Weekly Theta Gang Thread", "selftext": "Another good week, I knew the banks would do poorly but I didn\u2019t think it would be that bad. After seeing the reality of the earnings numbers I bought back the puts I wrote on GS and C in a panic but the market clearly doesn\u2019t care how poorly earnings go. If I had held they would have expired worthless. This market is starting to scare me with how much it\u2019s gone up but I\u2019m not fighting the trend. I still think oil is close to the bottom, so I\u2019ll wheel into USO again once they fully roll into June contracts. \n\nThis week is huge so I am planning to write options every day. Big ones I plan to be focusing on are: IBM, KO, NFLX, DA, DPZ, INTC. I\u2019ll probably write some USO puts too. Let me know what options you\u2019re writing.", "created_utc": 1587326670.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g4edq1/weekly_theta_gang_thread/", "is_self": true}
