Yeah, you did some pretty dumb stuff, but you actually made a profit.\n2. Why on earth did you buy another 500 shares at $35.30?\n\n\\#1 isn't as non-moronic as you might think, because the profit from that trade is only slightly greater than what I lost from holding through the ER and Trump's tweets (not to mention some other stupid stuff I did on the way down).\n\nAs for #2, it might seem dumb at first but it's actually genius. Hear me out.    \nAt that point, it seemed like AMD might well just take off into the stratosphere - leaving me, the idiot that sold at $33.62 behind. That was making me sad. So now if the price dips, I can be balance out the sadness from seeing those 500 shares go down in value with being able to buy back in at a good price. On the other hand, if the price goes up I get to look at a green number.\n\nOh yeah, and I also sold a covered calls on those shares so the profit on my option goes up as the share price drops too!\n\nIt's the perfect psychological hedge.", "created_utc": 1565375680, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/co6i5k/does_this_earn_me_a_place_among_your_ranks/", "is_self": true}
