You will lose, EVEN IF you are right.", "selftext": "We got a lot of noobies here so let's do some basic educatin.\n\nThe world doesn't operate on classical economics. It doesn't give a fuck about Austrian economists like  Friedman or Mises either. It's even left the Keynesians in the dust. The new economic theory governing the FED is Modern Monetary Theory. It's a Brave New World out there, and using your common sense to invest just doesn't cut it anymore under the rules of MMT.\n\nIf this is a new term for you, it's time to do some reading. Here is a quick description from Wiki:\n\n \n\nMMT's main tenets are that a government that issues its own money:\n\n1. Can pay for goods, services, and financial assets without a need to collect money in the form of taxes or debt issuance in advance of such purchases;\n2. Cannot be forced to default on debt denominated in its own currency;\n3. Is only limited in its money creation and purchases by [inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation), which accelerates once the real resources (labor, capital and natural resources) of the economy are utilized at [full employment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAIBER);\n4. Can control [demand-pull inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand-pull_inflation)[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Monetary_Theory#cite_note-5) by taxation and bond issuance, which remove excess money from circulation (although the political will to do so may not always exist);\n5. Does not need to compete with the private sector for scarce savings by issuing bonds.\n\nThese tenets challenge the [mainstream economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainstream_economics) view that government spending is funded by taxes and debt issuance.[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Monetary_Theory#cite_note-Kelton1-6)[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Monetary_Theory#cite_note-Kelton2-7)[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Monetary_Theory#cite_note-MMT_Beginners_Guide-4) \n\nFor example, as former Fed Chair [Alan Greenspan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Greenspan) said, \"The United States can pay any debt it has because we can always print money to do that. So there is zero probability of default.\"[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Monetary_Theory#cite_note-8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's right folks... ZERO PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT. We can just print, print, print forever. The only thing holding us back is Zimbabwe style hyperinflation. And surely that can't ever happen here, because we effectively rule the world and if we go broke the world goes broke. The United States itself is Too Big To Fail!\n\nThe interesting thing here is MMT isn't even being applied just to government spending and debt... it is being socialized to the private sector to prop up businesses and the markets. Not just unlimited free money for the government, but EVERYBODY with a market cap over 1B. MMT meets Corporatism. Exciting stuff!\n\nSo how do you invest in a market governed by MMT? Don't ask me, friend. I'm still stuck in cash gang mode because stocks wont go low enough to buy and wont go high enough to put.\n\n**TL;DR- Fuck your common sense, we MMT now and the old rules no longer apply. Buy mutual funds and never look at the market again because STONKS CAN ONLY GO UP!**", "created_utc": 1584971598.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fnkbdh/dont_bet_against_mmt_you_will_lose_even_if_you/", "is_self": true}
