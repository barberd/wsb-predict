{"id": "fxf16k", "title": "This relief rally is based on HOPE, not fundamentals.", "selftext": "All economic data is pointing towards a devastating recession - unprecedented levels of unemployment, dividends slashed, downgrading corporate debt, insolvencies, mortgage crisis, all-time high indebtedness and the FUCKING GLOBAL ECONOMY IS HALTED. \n\nYet our puts/shorts are not working... but that's okay. \n\nThe bulls disregard the above for the hope that central banks can print their way out of a pandemic-induced recession. Investors jump back in, desperate not to miss a V recovery. It is understandable (albeit retarded imo). Thus, the market continues to gain.\n\nCovid is far from over, the global economic damage shutting down the economy is not reflected in the stock market today. This is not an investors rally, it's a hopium fueled fomo dead cat bounce. With the dream of returning to another 10 year bull market.\n\nGive it a few weeks and watch the hopium run out, and reality kick in. Don't buy short-term puts, that's purely gambling. Let the market work it out. \n\nThe lows WILL be re-tested. & broken :D", "created_utc": 1586380432.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxf16k/this_relief_rally_is_based_on_hope_not/", "is_self": true}
