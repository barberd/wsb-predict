How can the GREATEST COMPANY ON EARTH be trading for less than MORNINGSTAR\u2019S fair value of the stock???? This is lunacy. With Satya NUTella at the helm of this mighty ship clear waters are ahead but these pussies who don\u2019t believe in my man are selling the stock. I repeat MSFT is a DEEP value play and it clearly undervalued by any way you look at it. Keeping loading up on calls boys unless ur a pussy I dare you to short the stock so you will be punished for doubting this great company. Please if you don\u2019t believe me put your money where your damn fat ass mouth is and short the company so that I will benefit from the short squeeze that is INEVITABLE. CALLS. THIS IS THE WAY!!!!!!!!!", "created_utc": 1581531543, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f2vhu0/why_is_not_msft_going_up/", "is_self": true}
