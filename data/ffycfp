Co-worker went to a conference recently about someone receiving a grant from Bill and Melinda Gate's Foundation to produce medication in the US. Apparently the speech derailed a bit talking about how most medicines are produced in China because of the raw materials there and because of the Coronavirus, this could cause shortages. Apparently this has already been causing a shortage for some drugs but it can get far worse, real fast. \n\nI did some digging and already saw some articles talking about this, but it doesn't seem like it's anything that has fully caught media's attention.  For example:  [https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-slows-drug-production-in-china-the-worlds-pharmacy-11582900885](https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-slows-drug-production-in-china-the-worlds-pharmacy-11582900885) \n\n [https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/u-s-officials-worried-about-chinese-control-american-drug-supply-n1052376](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/u-s-officials-worried-about-chinese-control-american-drug-supply-n1052376) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt this rate, if production is remained at a halt, there's going to be multiple shortages and everyone is going to be shitting themselves and beervirus will be balls deep in pharmaceutical.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn conclusion, **short active** **pharmaceutical** **ingredients** **companies** such as PFE, NVS, SNY, GSK.\n\nIn b4 already priced in, but also I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about because I lost a ton of money being a gay bear last year.", "created_utc": 1583775213.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffycfp/time_to_short_pharma_as_well/", "is_self": true}
