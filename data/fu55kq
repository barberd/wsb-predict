Again I don't want to jump on an online witchhunt but Questrade's own website doesn't even address these allegations, what are you hiding Questrade? I think we owe it to the poor people who lost their lives to Nazis(possibly Questrade?) in WW2 to demand answers from Questrade and refuse our business until they address this. Again I'm not saying that they did or didn't solely cause the Holocaust, I'm just trying to round up the facts.", "created_utc": 1585905386.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fu55kq/does_anyone_have_any_evidence_against_questrade/", "is_self": true}
