{"id": "fgql2y", "title": "Possible $SQ short opportunity.", "selftext": "For those of you that don't know, Square Inc. is a merchant service and mobile payments company whose primary client base are small businesses.\n\nNow, according to their 10-K, around **75%** of their revenue is from transactions, where they skim around 2-4 percent of the transaction. they also have hardware sales, but their second biggest line of revenue is from their business management subscription services that small businesses use.\n\nNow here's the thing; Square's share price has dropped significantly during the beer virus outbreak ($85 - $67), but is still significantly higher than its late 2019 average price. Its most recent drop follows directly after a quick run up starting around 2 months ago. That means SQ's price still reflects its guidance of pre 2019 Q4 earnings release, which is the key to my thesis.\n\nExperts say that we'll have a major Italy level pandemic in **10 days**. Besides the systematic risk that will \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b fuck Square's valuation, there will also be mass quarantines and complete shutdown of cities. That means people won't be spending money at small businesses and brick n mortar stores, which means small businesses will not be generating sales and Square will not be generating transaction revenue. In addition, the average small business owner has almost **$200,000** worth of debt, debt that will no longer be able to be paid off due to lack of consumer level economic activity, and many small businesses will be forced into bankruptcy and go out of business.\n\nSo $SQ has a double whammy coming in. It will lose revenues for at least 2-3 months, and will lose a significant amount of its subscription revenue due to the closing of thousands of small businesses across the US. \n\n**TL;DR: $SQ 5/15 40p**", "created_utc": 1583896544.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fgql2y/possible_sq_short_opportunity/", "is_self": true}
