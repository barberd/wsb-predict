{"id": "fi4b7z", "title": "IB credit default project update", "selftext": "Alright, guys, it's been about a week since the [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fe5s7e/the_fed_repos_are_an_attempt_to_prop_up_the/) I made about the federal repo market. It garnered a lot of attention and interest. Since then, we've moved very quickly and have mobilized a team of some 35-odd people to run analysis on... well, everything.\n\nSomehow, we managed to conscript a WSB user with a Bloomberg, and we've been scraping data on foreign banks for analysis. This morning, [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhth46/how_the_fed_might_actually_fix_this_fuckup_or/) was brought to our attention and we've switched focus to identifying banks with SBS exposure. So far, we've found a few names with massive (and I mean massive) amounts of exposure to poorly rated SBS pools (CCC or lower). Allianz has exposure to the tune of 20% of their total SBS involvement. It's nuts.\n\nWe're not going to post any tickers yet, but we're tracking the virus and trying to predict manufacturing and retail/service disruptions in Europe and in the US. These disruptions are likely to lead to credit defaults across the world. Now, as noted in the post above, these debts have been packaged, leveraged, and resold to various banking institutions. They've been used as collateral in repo transactions (which is why we saw the interbank repo spike last year).\n\nThe reason why the Fed is pumping cash through the PDBs is because Jamie Dimon has Powell's balls in a vice. Large US banks are holding enormous fucking bags right now that are growing bigger by the day. They likely have an excellent exit strategy in place, so they're not going to fail - in fact, they'll probably profit off of it. However, as soon as the Fed runs out of credit to extend, a lot of these SBS are going to fail.\n\nBasically, as predicted in both my post and the one I've linked above, the international banking system is direly at risk. You're not going to lose by shorting the world right now, but we're still working on providing a list of specific tickers to drive to 0. This is The Big Short 2.0, fellas; the difference is that it's corporate bonds this time instead of mortgages.\n\nWe have a [GitHub](https://github.com/joesocktwo/Wall-Street-Bets-Master-Doc) that's open to the public (for viewing) where you can find some of our research. At the behest of u/theycallmeryan, we'll continue posting updates as new information comes in. What we can tell you right now, though, is that these past few weeks are just foreplay. The real selloff has yet to come.
