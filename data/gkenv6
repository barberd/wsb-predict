Having tasted the fruits I now find myself unable to perform in my normal line of losing 2-5k weekly on SPY weeklies and whatever tickers posted in comments that tickled me while browsing the Daily Thread.\n\nI will now be rotating my barely-earned funds through various earnings plays and stupid shit that is suggested to me in hopes of scoring big with minimal effort.\n\nBIDU earnings are Monday. I don\u2019t know anything about them except their chart crashed bigly after February and never recovered. It has not been successful for me to gather DD.\n\nPositions:\n\nBIDU 5/22 105c\nBIDU 5/22 110c\nBIDU 5/22 120c", "created_utc": 1589567463.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gkenv6/bidu_10k_play/", "is_self": true}
