{"id": "hf5ndx", "title": "#1 mobile gaming app for 2020 crushes the competition and it\u2019s players.", "selftext": "Since March of 2020, Robinhood\u2019s \u201cStonk trading\u201d augmented reality game has quickly grown to be the most popular game in the world. Despite competition from the likes of Thinkorswim, and more recently Webull, Robinhood\u2019s still reaching highs of 10.7 million concurrent players during trading hours, and with over 200 million registered players as of May 1st, Robinhood is undoubtedly unbeatable right now. The real question, however, is whether Robinhood will be able to maintain it\u2019s popularity once the upcoming DLC, \u201cMarket Correction\u201d is released. \n\nTo answer that, we\u2019re going to have to cast our minds back to when Covid 19 first started appearing in Chinese bat meat. Many thousands of ordinary people found themselves unemployed or \u201cworking from home\u201d as state and federal governments began shutting down businesses and discouraging public contact in an attempt to curb the spread of \u201cCOVID 19\u201d. The displaced workers, initially spending time day-drinking and playing ordinary video games, became restless. Word spread quickly about Robinhood and it\u2019s hallmark game \u201ctrading stonks\u201d.  \n\nPart of Robinhood\u2019s appeal comes from its unexpected narrative. Despite it existing solely as an MMORPG, RH spent the majority of 2019 breaking the usual multiplayer gameplay tropes by introducing a continuously evolving plot line spanning multiple seasons of Stonk Trading content.\n\nIt all started with a free stock for signing up, and then more free stock for recruiting new players. This created a sense of easy money in the RH community and since then there\u2019s been numerous in-game events like \u201cDaily Pump and Dump\u201d, \u201cWhich way will the market go?\u201d and the soon to be released \u201cYOLO on SPY puts\u201d\n\nReddit\u2019s wonderful way of accepting and supporting new players means it has created an incredibly passionate community, which thrives on speculating on what it all could mean and the potential outcomes. Without these awe-inspiring moments, the game wouldn\u2019t be half as intriguing. The community is the heart of Robinhood- yes, even the WSB players who love to kill you with a \u201cban\u201d headshot.\n\nAlthough RH has been executing the most impressive multiplayer narrative in games for over a year now, none of that matters if the game isn\u2019t enjoyable to play. But there\u2019s a reason it\u2019s captured the attention of millions around the world, and it isn\u2019t just down to the Gay Bear dance and Stonks always go up attitude.\n\nIt\u2019s the trade-by-trade experience.\n\n\nIt\u2019s not difficult to see why Robinhood initially exploded in popularity. Free stocks; the only battle Royal for Tendies; retard-friendly aesthetics; and not to mention that the average skill level is \u201cnone\u201d. Players have not improved along with the game itself. When RH first launched, single stock transactions were elite tier, not the complex Double Iron Sheik Diving Condor Spreads some players can construct now in an instant - and this is coming from someone who can mostly keep up with the meta and wins fairly consistently. Robinhood\u2019s encouragement to \u201cGo ahead, try some options\u201d also helps keep the game feeling fresh, and proves that it\u2019s constantly listening to its community.", "created_utc": 1593020929.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hf5ndx/1_mobile_gaming_app_for_2020_crushes_the/", "is_self": true}
