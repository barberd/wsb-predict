{"id": "f6ycx0", "title": "What happened with the dip today", "selftext": "It is a combination of of \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b(role playing as the \ud83d\udca3) and GS + JPM ignited the bomb. What is left is a flash dip right before EU market is closed.\n\nI had been day trading recently and found this stupid pattern, but I didn't think it strike today on US trading time. Basically \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b fear any news related to Coronavirus. US investors seem to absorb those news better. If you look at the recent news about coronavirus and correlate that with the market movement time frame, you will see a pattern that if there is a coronavirus news, market goes down EU trading time, rebound in US trading time. This thing fucked me so many time. These \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3balways cause a premarket sell off while US investors are having a good night sleep at 4AM, then when people wake up at 6AM, people see good price, mass buy and stonks price shoot up. It doesn't happen once, or twice, but many times. Today is GS/JPM give warning on virus and trigger these \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bfucking panic right in US trading time, mass selling right at the end of the day, so they can go to bed and sleep well. \n\nJust think about it for a moment. Compare to SARS, this Covid-19 can be cured unless the hospitals are overcrowded. Every other nations have already quarantine Covid-19 suspect because all of us learnt the lesson of MERS and SARS hard. Combining with less risk of death, only China is fucked by this virus. The worst two possible scenarios are (1) China can't stop worker from dying leading to production shortage and (2) Cambodia will fuck us very hard (Cambodia's cruise ship welcome went tits up) but that is OK, we can treat them as a smaller version of China. I had doubt US ability to prevent the virus in the past, but now they have proven doing it very effective.\n\nToday I just took a nap and when I realized what is happening, I missed the chance of buying the dip because these \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b waited for the market about to close to do the mass sell bomb shit and all I have left is little time to do proper research. When I am fucking done, the market is fucking closed. You guys are not kitten, don't let these \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b a good night sleep. Make them learn why \ud83d\udc3b are \ud83c\udf08 when they wake up tomorrow seeing they sold their position for cheap price.\n\nTL DR: \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bis selling their investment for cheap price then go to sleep. Buy it or hold your position, be a good person, don't be a \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b\n\nThank you for listening to my TED talk and sorry for my poor Englando", "created_utc": 1582227371, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6ycx0/what_happened_with_the_dip_today/", "is_self": true}
