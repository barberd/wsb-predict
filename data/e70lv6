{"id": "e70lv6", "title": "Cheap and explosive, this is one to watch!", "selftext": "I have owned Broadmark (brmk) for four years as a privately held real estate lending company. It makes real estate loans on low risk ventures with trusted contractors. My returns have averaged 10-12%/year. The company was just acquired about a month ago by Trinity Group. It has been publicly traded as BRMK for the past month. The starting price was 10.45 and is currently trading at 11.94. It has been heading north the past several days with increasing volume. It is still a thinly traded issue with only 30% institution interest. The company intends to maintain its dividends as well as stock appreciation. Once the big institutions buy in, this issue is going to explode!", "created_utc": 1575648105, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e70lv6/cheap_and_explosive_this_is_one_to_watch/", "is_self": true}
