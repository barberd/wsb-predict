In particular, **NEVER buy specific options with specific dates and strikes, especially \"lottos\" that are deep OTM.**  \n\nE.g., someone on Twitter writes, \"hey look at that unusual ROKU activity at double the current stock price that expires in one month...u never see that! rumors they are getting bought out!  ROKU $240c 7/17.  i cant click dat mouse for u\"\n\nE.g., \"hey all I am good at trading and I am a ninja that trades, I think I am going to buy $STOCK lottos at $strike on xx/xx ... don't mind the fact that it's $960 with double digit volume and open interest and the bid/ask spread is $400\"", "created_utc": 1593570988.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hj1qx2/danielle_fong_achieves_legendary_investor_status/", "is_self": true}
