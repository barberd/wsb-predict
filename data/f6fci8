It accounts for 30% of internet traffic and partners with Netflix and many other large content companies. \n\nIt has just broken through $100 and reached and held a new all time high (weak hands took profit 4 days ago). Their Q4 2019 earning report was excellent and pleased analysts with their content deliver business growing and their new security arm taking off. \n\nOn GlassDoor the company rates as a 4.3 and the CEO is very well favored by staff. This is a solid company, exceeding expectations, and it's due to cruise through to the 100-teens this year. \n\nIf you don't think the internet is going away and use it to enjoy content (eg. Tits) it's your patriotic duty to buy calls in AKAM! \n\n(Own no positions. Waiting on dealer.
