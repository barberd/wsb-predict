{"id": "ckvsym", "title": "I track YOLOs so you don't have to - August, 2019", "selftext": "For those of you that aren't familiar with the site I created, it's at:\n\n[https://www.swaggystocks.com](https://www.swaggystocks.com)\n\nIt contains a WSB 'Sentiment' analyzer, Due Diligence tracker, and a YOLO tracker so that your \"favorite\" quality WSB reddit posts don't get lost in the fray.\n\n# Quick \"How it works\":\n\n\\- I log positions of posts flagged as \"YOLO/Gains/Losses\" and post them to my site. For actual options YOLO plays it will automatically keep track the current value of the play and the win/loss percent. Every position on the site links back to it's appropriate thread on WallStreetBets so you can take a look and read the comments as well!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll other gains, losses, and expired YOLOs are placed in the \"Expired YOLOs\" section.\n\nPlease note I do my best to keep track of them all and sometimes the OP of the YOLO disappears in which case I let the YOLO ride until expiry. It's fun to see what they could be worth!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFuture Updates (Here's what I am currently working on for the site and should be ready in the next 2 weeks):\n\n\\* **Upcoming Earnings Calendar** \\+ tracking of historical earnings results (coming very soon)\n\n\\* **Nice charts/graphs** to display a company's **financial statements** so you can read through important financial stats at a glance using visuals. (coming very soon)\n\n\\* **Options analyzer tool** for making at-a-glance comparisons between option YIELDS for different strikes and expiration dates (in 2-3 weeks)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere are some notable YOLOs/Gains/Losses from the month of July:\n\n**Most Insane Active YOLOs:**\n\n$20,000 - u/blueblarflubar BET on ATVI (PUTS)\n\n$45,000 - u/QQQmeintheass BET on AAPL (PUTS)\n\n$21,000 - u/zenwarrior01 BET on GOOG (CALLS)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Biggest Gains:**\n\n$263,270 - u/7figurebetontesla on $TSLA\n\n$240,000 - u/Momar11\n\n$228,000 - u/StreetAutist on $DISH\n\n$209,571 - u/thedogman420\n\n$180,000 - u/analfarmer2 (congrats anal farmer) on $ALGN\n\n$35,000 - u/MoltenBoron (guy is an elemental wizard)\n\n$34,000 - u/stormwillpass on $TSLA and $AMZN\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Biggest Losses:**\n\n\\-$113,000 - u/GhettoGainsGoblin\n\n\\-$110,000 - u/kodbell\n\n\\-$54,130 - u/kid70 (on a roll)\n\n\\-$47,390 - u/kid70\n\n\\-$47,971 - u/canthinkof123\n\n\\-$40,000 - u/Dannyz7365\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are a few data entry errors on the site I will fix in the next week or so, but if anyone has any feature recommendations, comments, or concerns post here!\n\nGodspeed bois", "created_utc": 1564700636, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ckvsym/i_track_yolos_so_you_dont_have_to_august_2019/", "is_self": true}
