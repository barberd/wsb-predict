{"id": "bn7vac", "title": "Let's make Happy Meal Tendies: a study/discussion of MCD and its future. :)", "selftext": "So last Thursday (5/2), I said MCD had just pulled back from profit taking and found a nice bottom at 193.50 and suggested that it will very likely test 200 again (which is what it hit from ER beat). I said, if it will test 200 again soon, there's a 10k play. I suggested to buy, on 5/3 (friday), 100x 202.50c . 5/31exp for 0.46, and speculated that if MCD would hit 200 within 7 trading days or so one would make 10k and it did just that. (the tragedy of this story is i didn't/couldn't follow my own play (long stupid story). Anyways, I've been following MCD very closely since March 1st. \n\n(there's another tragic story here: on March 1st, when MCD was at 184.50, I bought 100 180p FD's (of course), thinking it had to go down. I was correct. At the time, it was the biggest play i'd ever made. I was all in $3.5k for 100 contracts. And I was nervous/anxious the whole weekend because on Friday, MCD kind of jumped up and I saw minus $300 and thought I'd made a big mistake. Anyways, on Monday, MCD opens with a gap down and starts going down, and I cash out with +$800, happy I didn't lose money. I traded on emotion. AFTER i cashed out, I checked for the news on MCD and saw that they admitted that they didn't make as much money for winter quarter and it just plummeted all the way down 179.70. If I'd sold at the bottom, I would have made 20k!!!!!! :(   ... ). \n\nThe point is, I swore to myself that after missing out on 20k gains on MCD, one day I'd make big gains on MCD... fast forward, I did make 2k on MCD from the last super bullish FOMC announcement a couple months ago. But then I missed out on this 10k play i shared with everyone last week. So really MCD owes me like 28k. lol. \n\n\\----------------------------------------\n\nIf we zoom out on the daily chart, we can see that MCD had a very large bullish wedge from which it broke out in a super bullish way on 2/14, valentine's day. [https://www.tradingview.com/x/8IpHSUH0/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/8IpHSUH0/) Since then it has been trading along a channel, from which it broke above twice, kind of creating a two lane high way to heaven: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/H4MWKGwI/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/H4MWKGwI/)\n\nNow this last daily candle (Friday) looks SUPER bullish. Just a massive green candle, sold fucking body full of buying with great volume. [https://www.tradingview.com/x/O6E3eIlS/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/O6E3eIlS/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThree possibilities: \n\n1. **Pullback**\n\n(a) MCD has had SEVEN green daily candles in a row. Typically, when I see seven candles in a row, where the seventh one establishes a new ATH, i'm tempted to buy puts. I did this, incidentally, on SBUX, on April 12. I bought 100 FD 75puts that were super cheap (0.12) when SBUX was at 77.10. When i shared this on the daily thread, people said i was stupid crazy to bet against a BECKY stock hitting an ATH with momentum. I thought surely SBUX couldn't have 7 days in a row, and must pull back a little before ER. I made 2k on that play. Maybe i just got lucky. i don't know. **The play, pick up a few 5/17 197.50p**. Sell on Tuesday or day trade on Monday depending on how things go. I'm super bullish on MCD right now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. **Consolidation**\n\nMaybe MCD just established a consolidation channel and will trade sideways in this new channel. In this case, day trading puts might work. [https://www.tradingview.com/x/Xc37JWL5/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Xc37JWL5/) . This is actually quite likely. MCD right now doesn't have a catalyst to push it below the channel or above. What's danger with going long is getting a false breakout signal like in COST's case: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/1mdN9jn0/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/1mdN9jn0/) .   On the day that COST established its new ATH (see arrow), the 4hour chart showed a golden cross on MACD (just like MCD today), and it poked its head above the channel. If you took that as confirmation and bought calls, though, you lost money. So this is risky. You could open Iron condors and open credit spreads above and below the channel, maybe one week at a time. This would have been very profitable on COST for past two weeks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. **keep going up** (but maybe after a day of consolidation?) If we look at the 4hour chart, it looks like it broke out of bullish wedge with conviction: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/OsvZifvB/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/OsvZifvB/) And MACD on 4hour just had a golden cross (see #2 above, though). **The play:** see what kind of news develops this weekend (obviously) with Gyna. Watch MCD on monday and start scaling in on the dip (if there'll be one) on **7/21 210c for 0.65ish.** There's some BIG boy open interest here (over 4.5k), so the liquidity is fantastic. Buy a few. If MCD pulls back al little, to like 198ish, no problem, average down and buy a few more, and see what happens. The BIG caution here is the possibility of consolidation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat we need is confirmation: a ***close*** **above 200 TWICE and MACD golden cross on daily, which would demonstrate a break from the channel.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat are your thoughts?", "created_utc": 1557547466, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bn7vac/lets_make_happy_meal_tendies_a_studydiscussion_of/", "is_self": true}
