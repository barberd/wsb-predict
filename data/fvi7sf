I hit print and make it go Brrrrr.\"   - Jay (Jerome) Powell, the Bullgod.*\n\nI recently made a [post on here showing 3 charts for HYG](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fuys7m/hyg_in_3_charts/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x). I've been asked to do so for LQD. Not gonna do that. Instead, here are some charts of the complete shit the LQD is holding. And yeah, I know what the Fed is doing with LQD. Thanks, Einsteins. BB had a 3.5% effective yield in February 2020, and this was when people were talking about Fallen Angels, EBITDA being the fraud that it is, maturity walls, etc. ***And before someone goes full retard, just know this is a tiny portion of LQD.***\n\nParameters: LQD underlying securities, mature before 2031, duration <= 4, YtW >= 3.5. You might ask me why these parameters? Good question... moving on...\n\nPosition: I bought spit swaps, 50x Gerbil Balding 4 BBB and apparently am getting the ice cream, hot fudge, banana, and the nuts. My broker claims to get the sprinkles and the cherry as commission. Quite confident my broker is a gay bear... in the traditional sense.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[BBB \\(IG, so they claim\\), BB, B Effective Yields](https://preview.redd.it/s2xt8hfpe1r41.png?width=1168&format=png&auto=webp&s=a517ad840508fd05a0263680ec134bbf400099cc)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Fallen, or soon to be, Fallen Angels](https://preview.redd.it/qzieicblg1r41.png?width=1266&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5d90b97da97f492abcac5a85445c778cc347eb6)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[LQD securities trading like HYG, by numbers and sector](https://preview.redd.it/k5ydjd0nh1r41.png?width=1086&format=png&auto=webp&s=f31e53323ac1a88e49f27ceef19f195a5a4e0d9b)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: full retard comment\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit 2: u/Theprofitgrinder gets it", "created_utc": 1586110052.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fvi7sf/the_part_of_lqd_that_is_is_high_yield_part_2_kinda/", "is_self": true}
