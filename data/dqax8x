DD Inside, you're not going to believe this!", "selftext": "I was getting drunk last night at a bar in California, and I was talking to another drunk guy who worked for PG&amp;E. He's also a stoner.\n\nBasically, he drunk told me that the whole mess going on in California with PG&amp;E and them turning the power off for millions of Californians is so that all the grow-houses in Northern California lose their stock of marijuana and go bankrupt. Grow operations require a shit-ton of electricity, and if they're without power for even a few days the plants can die or not bud at all. That will make it easier and cheaper for large companies like Altia or Philips Morris to come in and buy up all the warehouses and grow operations. \n\nYa heard it here first folks.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerald_Triangle\n\nhttps://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-santa-barbara-pot-grows-20190612-htmlstory.html\n\nhttps://mjbizdaily.com/chart-where-does-californias-recreational-marijuana-supply-come-from/\n\nhttps://projects.sfchronicle.com/trackers/power-outages/", "created_utc": 1572644679, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dqax8x/long_mo_long_pmi_dd_inside_youre_not_going_to/", "is_self": true}
