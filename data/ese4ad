{"id": "ese4ad", "title": "PTON Updated Short Interest and Borrow Rates", "selftext": "According to mid-month estimates, about 77% of PTON's float is short at the moment. As a reminder, the lockup expires March 24th. Earnings on Feb 5th. \n\nIB has about 102k shares available to short at a cost of 44.9%.\n\nFidelity has 0 shares to lend at a cost of 28.0%\n\nIt is a high cost to short, but retail and institutional investors need to get excited about the stock before committing capital to it, so not enough of a catalyst by itself to start a squeeze. I'm still waiting patiently with my Feb 21st $35 calls and my March 20th $50 calls. Only positions I have at the moment other than cash.", "created_utc": 1579709430, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ese4ad/pton_updated_short_interest_and_borrow_rates/", "is_self": true}
