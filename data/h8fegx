I want to talk about Bank of America stock, the stress tests, and PPP Loans. \n\n for people who don't know how banks record loan losses i'll give a quick primer.  Banks take future predicted losses against todays earnings.  So if the bank needs 3% of their loan totals in the loan loss account, and they only have 2.5% in there, it will come out of that quarters earnings even though they didn't lose any money yet.  They just predict they will lose that amount sometime in the future. \n\non Jan 1 Bank of america voluntarily adopted new basel accord requirements for loan loss reserves. They added $3.3B on January 1.  Then Covid happened and they added an additional $3.6B on March 31.  That is $7B into their reserve account that wasn't there on dec 31.  \n\nSo what? \n\nBetween now and Jun 30th the federal reserve will announce stress test results that all banks over 100B have to go through.  BAC is on the list this year.  Passing the stress test has enormous considerations. Including the ability to increase their dividend (which they've done for 4 years).  \n\n**PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM LOAN FEE INCOME-WHAT NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT**\n\nAs of 6/6/20 BAC has made 300,000+ loans totaling $24B.  Average loan size is $77,000\n\nThe government is paying these banks a fee for these loans.  \n\n5% loan fee for loans under $350,000 \n\n3% loan fee for loans over $350,000 and less than $2,000,00 \n\n1% loan fee for loans over $2,000,000.  \n\n$25B loans, at 3% fee income is $750,000,000.  Loan fees over a certain amount have to have FASB adjustments and all that means is the loan fee income is amortized over the life of the loan.  In this case, 2 years.  Doesn't matter.  They're still gonna talk about it.\n\nThese loans are essentially risk free, 100% guaranteed by the gov't.  Banks are borrowing 0% special credit facility to fund these loans.  \n\n**BANK LOSSES DUE TO COVID** \n\nBanks will report close to no additional actual losses this quarter.  They offered extensions/forbearance on almost all loans. Some banks just sent a letter stating they were doing it automatically.  Those will come out of forbearance after July 1 and will not be reported past due.  They may be on a watch list, but they wont be reported past due until 30 days after the end of forbearance. \n\n\nBAC earnings 7/16\n\nJPM earnings 7/14\n\nMy position all in\n\n\n\n7/17 BAC $28C", "created_utc": 1592080936.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h8fegx/bac_dd_717_28c/", "is_self": true}
