Citrus and $OJ has had unconscious association with immunity forever--vitamin C not only pro immunity compound (bioflavanoids, etc.)\n2. Frozen juice in can such sliding consumption over decades but in absence of fresh squeezed, any marginal demand would be huge. When last time you bought?\n3. **60% of crop grown in Brazil.** In the hinterlands. Requiring farm labor to harvest. Then rail to transport to the sea. Then 4000 mile trip to florida etc. terminals. LOLZ if you think Brazil of all places won't get fucked by the Chinese Virus and that they have a resilient supply chain.\n4. **Price settles in Florida warehouses**. Meaning that's the only place (realistically) where supply demand matters if you need it NOW to produce.\n5. Most of bottlers are still in Florida. So very short supply chain from FL groves and stocks, most processing automated, food processing critical infrastructure.\n6. Futures on a relative basis lowish volume. Not much needed in terms of marginal consumer demand to spike price.\n7. Concentrate (raw materials) quite low % of final consumer price at store -- 2x or 3x in concentrate price doesn't imply 2x price at the store, maybe 1.1-1.5x MAX\n8. Implied vol of options in the 20%s recently low 30%s LOLOL despite being a storable, high calorie food commodity in a time of scarcity.\n\nSpot the lie!!!", "created_utc": 1584630436.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flbinq/l_o_n_g_frozen_concentrate_oj_futures_options/", "is_self": true}
