Let's say you want to write a put option on Amazon at a strike price of 1600. Robinhood only let's you do cash covered puts, so you would need to have 160K laying around to get the premium. Instead, you open a credit spread. Sell a put at a strike of 160, and buy a put at a strike of 157.5 (your insurance in case you end up in the money). Robinhood let's you close out your spreads separately. So if you manually sell off the 157.5 contract(your insurance) you get to pocket the entire premium from the 160 contract. I assume you can do this on the debit side as well. Note, I haven't tried this myself since that's a ton of risk", "created_utc": 1574793952, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e22di8/how_to_do_a_naked_callput_in_robinhood_yolo_at/", "is_self": true}
