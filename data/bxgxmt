{"id": "bxgxmt", "title": "Aspiring autist question", "selftext": "What's the strategy for getting buys filled at open when the orders are placed after-hours/pre-market?  I'm using RH and expected a big dump of DATA today (which happened) so yesterday after-hours I put in an order to buy puts which of course has just remained in the 'PLACED' status and will soon be worthless anyway as DATA recovers.  This has happened to me many times since the beginning of my options career which began literally days and days ago.\n\n I do understand that RH automatically recommends and sets a limit price for the options, so I understand that the reason my orders didn't fill is that by the time market opened the limit that RH had recommended was no longer attainable.  So my question is, what should I look at in order to set a limit that would likely close without just putting it at a ridiculous amount?", "created_utc": 1559828938, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bxgxmt/aspiring_autist_question/", "is_self": true}
