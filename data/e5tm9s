{"id": "e5tm9s", "title": "upcoming tariff deadline effect on US and China", "selftext": "I was wondering how big of a negative a tariff bump up for everything imported from China would be for the USA.  Distributors (Walmart, Amazon, Target, etc) would probably buy less stuff from China if the factories there don't lower prices.  There's no urgency for them to restock too after the holidays, but I am assuming the factories in China still have to stay open in order to keep their workers busy.  I do know the factories in China probably close for the Lunar New Year holidays around mid January.  Will they do it now if they don't get any new orders from the USA after December 15?  Also, China doesn't have any pigs to eat for their New Year's holiday.  US farmers have a lot of pigs.  So these CCP guys in China are willing to workers laid off early before the New Years along with super high pork prices for the holiday?  Not smart at all.  They should just do a deal and buy some pork.  Say what is needed to calm the situation.  They can always change the deal after Trump eventually leaves office in 2024.  If it's the long game they are thinking about, all the multinationals moving to Thailand and Vietnam has a great effect on the long game.  These guys aren't moving back to China anytime soon.  These communists are all above saving face rather than making the best deal for the current situation.", "created_utc": 1575432814, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e5tm9s/upcoming_tariff_deadline_effect_on_us_and_china/", "is_self": true}
