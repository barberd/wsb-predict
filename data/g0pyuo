Another question...\n\nThe company [Nikola Motors](https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/1565578D:US) use hydrogen fuel cells to power their long haul trucks and military-style combat vehicles. Hydrogen is a renewable energy source, with zero emissions. Massive market potential. Something like $4B in pre-orders with first trucks rolling out in 2021.\n\nNikola just got acquired by the SPAC VectorIQ ([VTIQ](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=fin&sxsrf=ALeKk02OY1f8exIwvk5EhKnvfPr9y-DL-w:1586805642701&q=NASDAQ:+VTIQ&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgecRowS3w8sc9YSn9SWtOXmPU5OIKzsgvd80rySypFJLmYoOyBKX4uXj10_UNDdPMzDLMso3MeBax8vg5Brs4BlophIV4BgIAMDL5lkwAAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjzjqTVj-boAhWQVc0KHe5oBZ0Q3ecFMAB6BAgQEBM&biw=1800&bih=1078)), which is managed by none other than GM legend [Steve Girsky](https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/person/1524718), who served on GM's board of directors from 2009 - 2016. Shares of VTIQ are currently trading at $11.74 and will convert to the ticker symbol NKLA sometime soon.\n\nTo put this opportunity in context, Tesla IPO'ed at $17 per share. Now it's trading $641 fucking dollars per share. \n\nDo you guys think Nikola has Tesla moon potential? Might be a couple years from now, which I know is difficult for you short-term-thinking-fucks to consider, but if so it's an absolute fucking steal at this price. \n\nTLDR;\n\nBUY VTIQ AND GO TO THE MOOOOOON", "created_utc": 1586806555.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0pyuo/is_nikola_motors_a_future_tesla_competitor_should/", "is_self": true}
