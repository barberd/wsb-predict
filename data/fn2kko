Do we not feel sad for poor, cash short, balance sheet wounded Lexcorp of America?  They're all leveraged out having bought back stock using 95% of net earnings.  \n\nSo let us take a trip down fantasy land with the large PUBLIC tenants of this bailout... because we'll have to read the bill on Monday after they pass it to be more livid than a Lorax on Truffula Tree Trimming Tuesday.\n\nFirst the big meaty play\n\n**\u2022$4 trillion of liquidity that we can use to support the economy - Those are broad-based lending programs. ... We can leverage our equity working with the Federal Reserve** \n\nSee bailouts for businesses that can afford lobbyists or quoting the rejected banking son of Satan - the plan is broad-based to help small and large businesses get through the next 90 to 120 days.\n\nThis is a painful straight up balance sheet shoring loan that basically says... keep what you need to stay in business but fire everyone else.  Great now all we will have at major corporations is a few key operations people surrounded by buckets of Finance and Legal personnel.  Already Fortune 500 companies have abandoned any strategy other than survive... And now you've funded that incompetent strategy without forcing them to think long term.  Well DONE you hybrid Giraffe Camel jungle bull child.  Getting our finance arms in the fortune 500 to think any further than quarter to quarter just became impossible.\n\nNext up- SMALL BUSINESSES... let's give a round to the Fed for even remembering that small businesses exist.  I mean they don't donate millions of dollars or have hoards of lobbyists for themselves so really they're the Schrodinger's cat of companies (\\*not really sure if they're dead or alive)\n\n**\u2022 Small-business retention loans aimed at helping companies keep  workers on their payrolls. This will cover about half the workforce,**  Mnuchin said. **Payments will include two weeks\u2019 worth of cash flow and  some overhead. The loans will be forgiven if workers are not laid off.**\n\n\\-  Two weeks of cash flow???? You want me to keep my employees for 6-8 weeks during this recessionary time to have them auto forgiven.  Screw it... give me the cash... I'll fire my employees and give them a severance bonus with part of the funds.  In the meantime I still have to figure out how to cover my property and equipment expenses on Two fing weeks of loan?  Sheesh... I guess I should just file my bankruptcy papers now.  For those who've never run a small business.  TWO WEEKS IS NOTHING...  \n\n\u2022 **Checks for Americans. The average check for a family of four will be $3,000, the Treasury secretary said**. \n\n\\- YAY, when do we get these checks??? Like a month from now when I miss my mortgage/rent payment on April 1st because - I'VE BEEN FIRED, Not for incompetence like in our finance system, a system overrun with Trust fund test tube babies.  Talk about the american public 57 years post birth wishing for early womb termination.  How do you economists even think this is going to help?  It needed to be a minimum of 2 months salary for the average American or $9,419.  \n\n**\u2022 Enhanced unemployment insurance for people who are laid off due to the pandemic.**\n\n\\- Oh GOODY a completely nebulous number stating that we get unemployment insurance. That's right folks, immediately following the quarantine lifts you all get to participate in a Hunger Games like competition for jobs under a tepid market for rehiring.  If you're older you can ask for a position at 50% of the salary you were making just 6 months ago!   \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWelcome to the CORONA age autists.  Where the FED is more disconnected than a Wall Street child of the night handing out soft serve cones in times square.  I'm going into my bunker for two months and posting gain bear porn.\n\n\\*I HATE BEING A BEAR...
