I have a Beam soundbar and it's the ear equivalent of tits and/or jizz, your preference, all over your body. It's 10 bucks now so it's a millennial gambling choice. You can only play music through a Sonos-app-approved streaming subscription so it never makes shit mixtape or bootleg sounds, thus maintaining a reputation. Apple has their eye on Sonos because of the subscription requirement (basic logic). The phones widget actually works, and fast. \nIf you don't believe me, walk into Best Buy and listen to it. It beats everything in its class. \nSONO calls until I can afford Bang and Olufsen.", "created_utc": 1553211555, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b3xrh0/its_been_a_while_since_theres_been_a_sonos_post/", "is_self": true}
