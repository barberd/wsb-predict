The plumbing of the economy (credit) is still clogged (transmission issues). It's like the septic tank is full of new shit BRRRRRRR'd by the fed, but the pipes are still 2\" because no bank is willing to lend while credit risk is elevated. You can see it with massive credit spreads like these:\n\n https://imgur.com/heGw8CI \n\n https://imgur.com/j43WmhQ \n\n(You also hear stories of non-qualified/non-agency mortgages having problems, including Angel Oak laying off 70% of their staff)\n\nAdditionally because corporate paper is way too expensive to issue, these companies (\\~100% which have a revolver) are drawing down on the revolvers. This creates additional shocks to the finance industry. Companies are doing this because\n\n1. The CP markets are still locked up, and even blue chips have no access to short-term funding\n2. Increasingly more companies are concerned their banks may not survive so why not just draw down the facility and hold the cash instead of being subject to the whims of some fickle bank Treasurer who may not have a job tomorrow\n3. Banks can cancel revolvers at any time if they feel the risk is too high\n\nYou think this hasn't started? The FRA-OIS spread is a measure of interbank borrowing prices. Even though the [discount window is at 0.25%](https://www.frbdiscountwindow.org/), banks still refuse to lend to each other because of each other's credit risk (and the credit risk of each bank's borrowers). \n\n https://imgur.com/S7WQtM2 \n\n\\------\n\nSo what can the Fed do right now? \n\n1. The more shit method: pump the septic tank with even more cash and hope the problem unclogs itself\n2. The Drano method: force the banks to lend more (JPOW giving Dimon a handy and persuading him to lend to these troubled companies)\n3. The extra pipe method: Fed directly lends to these businesses, as we've seen with the CP purchase program. Although ambitious, that still hasn't brought spreads down\n4. The guarantee method: essentially the fed monetizing everyone's debt, including CCL's recent $7 billion issuance. They can promise buyers the bonds won't lose money, because they will buy the debt at the original price (similar to the TALF program)\n\nIn any case, the Fed will be pushed to move earlier than later. The Fed has opened Pandora's box of BRRRRRR in unlimited amounts and as soon as possible. They will be forced to move again to prevent large credit crunches sooner than later. \n\nSpoiler: they about to this with double the speed and double the ink [https://brrr.money/](https://brrr.money/)", "created_utc": 1585428339.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqs6db/stillwide_credit_spreads_will_force_the_fed_to/", "is_self": true}
