{"id": "g88p29", "title": "STOP LOSING YOUR HARD EARNED DOLLARS", "selftext": "I absolutely hate seeing accounts get blown up because people just follow the news or their set ideas on how bad the economy will be because of this virus. You need to make money while it's easy here. \n\nYou have to look at the MACRO, forget corona. Just leave it all alone. Don't even bother debating me because for now the market is going up with it around. You'll keep losing betting because of corona. It's a freaking election cycle, no way the markets can go into election cycle on a bad note. The downturn you are looking for will come after the election cycle. Sounds crazy? Well market going up everyday with corona is crazy and you keep thinking about that as the most important thing it's not. I'll stick with my after the election projection. If you think a short term dip would happen and inclined to keep buying spy puts, I'll look for Thursday as a safer gamble, any bad news on remdesivir when Gilead drops earnings will def lead to a selloff. Then you'll get a strong sell off Friday. But expect next few days including the fed meeting to be market assuring regardless of w.e happens outside the markets. Please think macro. Your thinking of micro and focusing just on the virus is why those bets keep failing . Eventually a crash will come or a drift down, but AFTER elections. \n\nGood luck to everyone, stay safe and let's be smart about this. Every penny counts. Think about the days you lost 100 bucks or 1k  and how much you could have honestly done with that.", "created_utc": 1587878172.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g88p29/stop_losing_your_hard_earned_dollars/", "is_self": true}
