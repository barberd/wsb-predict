For those of you who purchased options from my BE and CZR posts, we did / are doing quite well! Hopefully we can keep the streak alive. If not, I'll probably never post again from the shame or potential suicide.\n\nAnyway, I like to pick options that are incredibly cheap even at a far distance out so we have time for things to unfold and padding time to recover in case of bad news or if the money printer jams for a few days. But moreover, so we can make sweet loot from the delta/gamma multiplier our options premiums realize when the stock price starts to take off (moon). Notice that none of the random options I listed were more than a dollar. Additionally, I do realize that the company hasn't been close to $7 for 18 months, but I think the timing is right and you certainly do not have to buy options that are that far out of the money.\n\nHere's my latest brand of phDD:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Nokia was once a powerful company but it fell out of style and favor and has since pivoted to a much broader telecommunications market. It is now sitting well situated to become a major developer of antennas, base stations, network management tools, and SCADA systems throughout the 5G transition and beyond.\n2. Nokia has issued guidance on strong positive cash flows expected in the third and forth quarter of 2020. Nokia was plagued with frequent negative cash flows quarters since 2016. They lost $913 million euro in 2018 and $6 million in 2019. They are expecting positive cash flow of $350 million in 2020.\n3. Nokia had an expensive merger with Alcatel-Lucent in 2016. The subsequent integration of AL wasn't smooth and it resulted in lost marketshare in the 5G realm. Now the two companies have finally melded as one and the stronger, more broadly focused Nokia has begun to once again regain marketshare as seen [here.](http://prntscr.com/sw9ww6)\n4. Nokia is expected to make an announcement regarding reinstating dividend payments at the end of 2020. The last dividend payment was made in July of 2019.\n5. Nokia very recently moved forward with purchasing outstanding 500,000,000 EUR note at 1% for March of 2021. This is a good sign and what we like to see.\n6. 3 Upgrades this year from JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Raymond James. Northland Capital also elected to give Nokia it's first rating set at outperform. whew!\n7. Anal Ratings: 5 Strong Buys & 2 Hold. 0 Sell.\n8. Next Earnings is 7/23/2020. I do not expect major or even moderate IV increase as this is not a highly anticipated earnings but it certainly won't hurt having that approximately six weeks out if you decide to buy nearer term options. Remember retards, IV makes up a significant value of option price.\n9. Implied Volatility is presently trending higher recently crossing the 40% percentile. That's not bad and pretty low considering NOK has bounced 80% off it's KungFlu low of \\~ $2.50\n10. There is virtually no short interest on Nokia. Currently short interest is less than 0.5% of float.\n\n**- Moar Bullish Bullshit  -**\n\nNokia still makes a full array of phones and some pretty unique accessories to go with them. The phones are fairly popular in Europe and consistently rated highly by Consumer Reports and similar review organizations. The statistics and performance of these phones (memory, display, battery life, camera megapixels) are very competitive with the rest of the industry, including Apple, and they MSRP for approximately 20% of the cost.\n\nOver the past two weeks or so I've seen Yahoo Finance, Barron's, Zacks, and InvestorPlace start running virtually identical articles. I \\*usually\\* take this to be a good thing as it gets the name out there more. Stonk investing is a name popularity contest.\n\nBefore a bunch of you jerks go through my post history and scream about how similar this is to my post on CZR, please note that I have a system that I work through when doing DD. So I'm simply outlining the same bits of information from the routine that I like and I copypasta saves me a lot of time. I can't explain this coincidence though:\n\nI saw BUY NOK CALLS spray painted on the TD Ameritrade in downtown San Francisco off market street. The A in CALLS was an anarchy symbol. That was the inspiration to look into this further. I've come to realize us degenerates are everywhere if you just happen to be looking. This, I like.\n\nMy Position  \n1/15/21 $5c\n\n**TL;DR: BUY NOK C\u24b6LLS BR\u24b6H**", "created_utc": 1591854508.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h0t5aq/nokia_nok_has_dirt_cheap_attractive_options_dd/", "is_self": true}
