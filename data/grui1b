{"id": "grui1b", "title": "$XRONA - The Fund for the Pandemic that Never Was", "selftext": "The data has begun to pile up and we're getting a better look at what it all means: For anyone not in a nursing home, it may not have been much of a pandemic at all. And except for those over 65 with a condition, the CDC numbers show your chances of death after catching the virus to be in the same ballpark as a suffocating while choking yourself watching your wife's boyfriend shit in your yard.\n\nFurther data and analysis will come, perhaps illustrating that I am actually a full-blown fucking retard, weeks away from losing the [fat million](https://i.imgur.com/NzQRRKu.png) I made on the drop. But until then, I'm going all-in on $XRONA: the fund that assumes that future lockdowns will not only be unnecessary, but that nobody gives a fuck anyway. \n\nPeople are exhausted. They are ready to accept the 99.7% chance of survival, and they'll have it with a side of gambling, air travel, theme parks, and, I don't know, real estate? This is an extremely limited-time opportunity that you should have started on three days ago.\n\nCruise lines: Some WSBer made a couple million and now thinks he can retire in a few months on $NCLH. So far he's been smarter than almost all of you. Also, calls on $CCL? why not.\n\n$DIS $SEAS - On the way up, still room to go.\n\n$LUV $AAL - At this point, you're in the 'B' or 'C' boarding group, but you can still make the flight.\n\n$CAR - I jumped on this two days ago and doubled my money. Should have gone way harder, but there's still some left. Rebounding market with less competition.\n\n$MGM - sure.\n\nShort $MRNA and $CODX hard - We no longer need dubious vaccine or shitty tests.\n\nREITs - $NRZ $BXP $VNO Everyone can work from home! Yea, no. People are going back to work. Every time somebody mentions a drop in real estate, everyone says \"I'm gonna buy a(nother) house when the real estate market dips!\" which means any dip will be small and short, just like my diiiiiii\u2014\n\nStrike price and date? Start with a month out at 15% below whatever the stock price was at the beginning of November.
