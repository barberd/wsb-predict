Probably less at open because of the after hours gap down of $0.04.\n\nObviously -- I can just exercise and take the max loss of $40 on this. It appears I'm restricted from buying, for whatever reason although there's plenty of extra buying power beyond the short position (like double the short position, so that's weird). I've lost the opportunity to cash in on the spread if the stock tanks unless it drops below $5 since the short leg is exercised, so do I just take my $40 loss and walk away?\n\nOr am I missing another play here since there's still time value on the $6 calls? I find it odd it didn't instantly exercise the $6 leg also and just withdraw my position.\n\nLet's hear it bois, I live for this shit\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "created_utc": 1552278562, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/azoymr/assigned_38_days_early_on_short_leg_of_a_call/", "is_self": true}
