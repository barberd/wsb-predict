Is not that Trump doesn't want a deal, but I don't see China willing to make a deal. And today's news kinda confirm it. China USA struggle to set meeting for sept? File complain at WTO? All these seems like they want waiting for the next election and hoping Trump will not be re-elected. All the talk about China want to de-escalate the situation last week are just bullshit hoping Trump will delay the 15% increase. \n\nFrom personal experience dealing with china (import and export). Stalling is part of the culture, they are hoping to stall long enough so the issue will just go away. And thats exactly what they are doing with Trump, however, there is no way Trump will just let this go away and back to the way it was.", "created_utc": 1567453850, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cyu0x5/serious_china_usa_trade_war/", "is_self": true}
