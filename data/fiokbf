{"id": "fiokbf", "title": "[DD] Dutch article: Private investors are buying while institutional are selling", "selftext": "**TLDR**: New accounts created at (Dutch) brokerages are at a record high. Private investors are buying 2.5x as much as they are selling. People think this dip is temporary and stocks are 'cheap.' This means that institutional investors are currently the ones creating this huge downtrend. It also recaps a lot of the information going around on r/wsb, about how this might be only the beginning of a new big recession and stocks could be going down much lower still.\n\nMy personal take: we might be in for a bounce the upcoming days due to huge amounts of private money entering the stock market, but I still believe in a huge continued downtrend in the next few weeks/months. Corona impact is huge, top officials in Europe are now admitting that 50% of people are going to get infected and the only valid option left is trying to increase the duration of the pandemic to spread out the pressure on the healthcare system. This will mean a LONG time untill life will return to normal...\n\nLink (in Dutch, requires free account): https://fd.nl/weekend/1337776/particuliere-belegger-ruikt-kans-bij-corona-dip-voor-miljoenen-euro-s-ingelegd\n\nTranslation:\n\n**Private investors smell chance during corona-dip: 'Invested milions of Euros'**\n\nWhile a bloodbath is taking place on the stock exchange, Peter did something this week that goes against the market sentiment. He bought additional. And substantial too.\n\nThe former entrepreneur sold defensive securities such as bonds last week and bought back large amounts of shares. 'That involves a lot of money, millions of euros. I have learned that the stock market tends to exaggerate strongly; you should take advantage of that opportunity,' said the private investor, whose full name is known to the editorial staff.\n\n**Blood through the streets**\n\nThis example does not stand alone, according to sources of Het Financieele Dagblad among banks, asset managers and stock brokers. There is panic in the financial markets, but Dutch private investors have not forgotten the stock market wisdom 'buy when blood flows through the streets'. Spokesmen for broker BinckBanck and private bank InsingerGillissen report that more shares are bought than sold, up to a factor 2.5 times as much.\n\nPrivate banking director at InsingerGillissen Paul Balk: 'We saw some customers build up a lot of cash on the sidelines to look for extra risk. They do that in addition to the diversified portfolio that is already in their possession. ' Balk notices that the investor sees similarities with the credit crisis of 2008, and therefore panics 'much less'. \"And above all, I feel that many clients see the corona virus as something temporary.\"\n\nThe question is, however, whether investors are now investing much too early.\n\nPrices in Europe collapsed again on Thursday, despite stimulus measures by the European Central Bank. The Amsterdam AEX lost 10.75% of its value on Thursday, the largest loss in one day since 'Black Monday' on October 19, 1987. Prices also plummeted in the United States. On Friday, the AEX ended the day with a tiny plus, but that is nothing compared to the previous losses. Measured from the beginning of the year, investors in the AEX are looking at a loss of 28.4%.\n\n**Social life disrupted**\n\nUnprecedented measures against the spread of the virus are in force in the Netherlands and in many other countries. Social life is disrupted. And that worldwide. As of today, an entry ban applies to Europeans to the United States. Consumers are hoarding, also in the Netherlands.\n\"In principle, a virus outbreak is a temporary thing,\" says investment strategist Ralph Wessels of ABN Amro. \"But it is far from being said that this is the bottom of the market. If the spread of the coronavirus takes longer, the economic damage is also greater. A really severe recession has not yet been priced in. \u201d\n\n**Share prices not in a straight line**\n\nMoreover, prices seldom move in a perfectly straight line during a crisis. The low point of the financial crisis, which started in May 2008, was only reached on the stock exchange in March 2009. The AEX was then at 199.25 points.\n\n'During the financial crisis, coordination and concerted action took place between governments and central banks worldwide. That was powerful and gave markets confidence. We don't see that at all now and that doesn't help sentiment either,' says Wessels. 'Everyone rolls over each other with measures. US President Donald Trump announces a tax cut without concrete plans and blames Europe for the corona infections in the US.'\n\n\n**Central bankers**\n\nThe fact that even more money from central banks has not yet been able to reassure the markets is worrying. The support should also come from governments, such as Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra, who came out with his own variant of former ECB President Mario Draghi's famous statement 'whatever it takes' on Thursday. Hoekstra is prepared to lend a lot, because the national debt is still well below the maximum prescribed by Europe of 60% of the gross domestic product.\n\nSo that is still borrowed money. The world has been increasingly in debt since the previous financial crisis. Central bank policies put interest rates historically low and even negative. House prices went through the roof, companies that would otherwise never get an affordable loan obtained cheap and easy credit. And low interest or not, all that debt has to be paid back someday. Fears that 'ever' changes to 'never' were already visible on the markets this week. The corporate lending market, with a global reach of $ 13,500 billion, stalled on Thursday.\n\n**'More emotion' with customers**\n\nIt doesn't seem to bother private investors. Bank employees also saw a significant increase in the number of transactions performed at ABN Amro and private bank Van Lanschot. At ABN, there was clearly talk of 'more contact from the customer, where more emotion was shown,' said a spokesman. The customer often wants one thing above average: get into the exciting roller coaster quickly.\n\nSomeone who also went against negative market sentiments is Tim Hulst, IT purchaser at insurer Univ\u00e9. When the oil price plummeted on Monday as a result of the price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia, he saw an 'enormous opportunity'. He bought pieces of Shell for \u20ac 10,000. \"I see it as a long-term investment. We are going to need oil for a long time, meanwhile the dividend yield at this rate is excellent. Even if Shell has to cut the dividend. \"\n\n**Many new investors**\n\nHulst was one of the many investors who caused a peak on the stock markets last week. According to investment trainer Hans Oudshoorn of BinckBank, there is even an unprecedented influx of new customers. 'The number of account applications now peaks, in recent days, up to a factor of ten compared to last year. I call it the Whatsapp indicator. Family and acquaintances inquire in Whatsapp groups about how to start investing, and now the time has come to get in cheaply. ' At the beginning of this month, a survey by the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) revealed that roughly one in six Dutch people invest.\n\n**Very busy with brokers and asset managers**\n\nThe crowds caused problems for asset managers and brokers on Monday, the busiest trading day of last week. For example, Robeco Direct customers were unable to log in, and online broker DeGiro did not show current price information. At ING and BinckBank, customers were unable to trade at all for some time. According to ING, this was an 'unfortunate accidental' failure. As a result, day traders say they have missed out on thousands of euros in price gains.\n\nBut fear of loss is not haunted by the minds of investors like Peter, the former entrepreneur who says he has stepped in for millions. \"You shouldn't be too eager, but I'm more than 90% sure I'm going to make a profit. Possibly within one to two years. \u201d", "created_utc": 1584216280.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fiokbf/dd_dutch_article_private_investors_are_buying/", "is_self": true}
