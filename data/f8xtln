{"id": "f8xtln", "title": "CCL Carnival Puts for dirt cheap", "selftext": "TLDR: CCL puts will print money because no one wants to get quarantined on a floating prison\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCruise ships are basically a floating prison where everyone else on board is a liability and could possibly be sick and carrying corona virus. There have already been ships that have been quarantined for WEEKS due to corona virus infections. \n\nCBS - [U.S. evacuating Americans stuck on quarantined cruise ship](https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-china-outbreak-death-toll-infections-france-europe-latest-updates-2020-02-15/) \n\nBusiness Insider -  [How the 'failed' quarantine of the Diamond Princess cruise ship started with 10 coronavirus cases and ended with more than 630](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-diamond-princess-cruise-ship-coronavirus-quarantine-went-wrong-2020-2) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot only that, but the passengers who returned from the cruises are infecting people on the mainland as well. \n\n BBC - [Coronavirus: Four new UK cases among ship evacuees](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51606368)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRight now, CCL is plummeting but puts are dirt cheap. $38 puts are going for 1.00 and stock price is already below that. This will literally print money\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCredit to u/xiccit for his post:\n\n\"You know cruise line puts are an option right? Look at CCL and RCL. Thank me later.\n\nEdit: seriously who's going to take a fucking cruise in the next year. Nobody. And a bunch more are going to get infected on them. They're having trouble docking ships now when it's basically nothing, what the fuck are they going to do when it's more widespread?\n\nThey're boned.\"", "created_utc": 1582577135, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f8xtln/ccl_carnival_puts_for_dirt_cheap/", "is_self": true}
