I was sippin on some covfefe this morning, the Starbucks kind, not some of that cheap ass shit. When I had a realization of how we can improve this community and potentially lose or make more money (50/50 chance of each).\n\nSome of you might remember my posts as the guy who made the WSB Sentiment Analyser, Due Diligence logger, and YOLO tracker.\n\n[The site can be found here - SwaggyStocks](https://www.swaggystocks.com)\n\nI want to continue adding to the site, and so my idea is THIS. It is based on creating groups of quality posters (aka not shitposts, or even shitposts IDGAF).\n\nWe (the mods) create groups of flairs, such as:\n-Bull gang\n-Bear gang\n-Thetagang\n-Pro shitposter\n-Does DD\n-TSLA Pumper\n-Options Picker\n-Meme gang\n-Etc\n\nThe people are assigned to these groups based on posts they create and content they contribute. (Similar to what SoRefreshing used to do).\n\nThe mods assign the flairs and then I create a script that constantly scans the forum adding people with these flairs to their designated groups. On my site you\u2019ll be able to see all the designated groups and when you click on one it lists all the users in the group with a link to their profile.\n\nSo we\u2019d be able to find all the people assigned to bull gang/bear gang, stock pickers, etc... then we can filter through a user\u2019s posts and find the quality content even \n\nWhat y\u2019all think?", "created_utc": 1567267726, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cxx8ef/just_thought_of_a_cool_ideascript_i_can_make_to/", "is_self": true}
