Stfu with your gay ass diamond hands BS and play smart. To put things into perspective, TRUMP and his BEAUTIFUL market will not give up 50% cap on this CHI-NUHHH virus that has the potential to kill 1% of all people in this world. Many of those deaths are already due to the viruses in comprised individuals. \n\nSecond, the economic drivers are all intact and will remain so. Piss off with you degenerates expecting the market to have another 2-3 circuit breaker day. It\u2019s no different than comparing a quarterly/half GDP to future growth:earnings. If you can look past a known one time issue with a company, NO ONE GIVES A FUCK. It\u2019s a sunk cost, bruh. And also, should unemployment really count when some people will be paid more by the stimulus package NOT to work? \n\nAll that being said, sToNkS and calls. Ride it out than being a gay bear. I used to be a gay bear too but makes no sense to be a gay bear when the market is clearly rallying and the opportunity cost is huge.\n\nSPY $275 4/20c", "created_utc": 1585631226.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fs6vxw/degenerates_unite/", "is_self": true}
