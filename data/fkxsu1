{"id": "fkxsu1", "title": "My 3-day journey on WSB.", "selftext": "tldr: no ones gonna read what I wrote, lost 80% of my profile in 3 days\n\nTo start off, I\u2019m 18 and VERY new to the stock market. \n\nI got robinhood on Monday (first mistake) added $100 to my account and bought a CCL put from the *discover* tab. It was trading at roughly 18$ and I got a CCL 3/20 $7.5p. I\u2019m happy and chilling bc everyone was hyped about puts. Then I told the discord about my puts and everyone cooked my ass for making the dumbest position of all time. I was freaking out until today, which I fucked up even more. I sold at the open and lost $40. I could\u2019ve actually made a profit on this and sold for $130 roughly. \n\nThen, I added $100 more dollars to my account and listened to someone here about buying JNUG calls. My position: JNUG 16c 3/20. It cost me $160 and my purchase power is now 0. I went all in on this when it was trading at $12. I stepped away for an hour or 2 and see it\u2019s trading at 7 fucking dollars. \n\nMy value is now $36 and I don\u2019t want to ever touch the stock market again. My all time loss is close to 80%. I went from $200 to $36 in 3 days. As you can see, I\u2019ve fuqqed up pretty bad. I knew I didn\u2019t lose much compared to you guys but I\u2019m a dumbass and lost 77% of my money in 3 days.", "created_utc": 1584567696.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkxsu1/my_3day_journey_on_wsb/", "is_self": true}
