{"id": "dl6vt8", "title": "$BYND Calls?", "selftext": "Hear me out:\n\nBYND is absolutely overvalued forward like the rest of the dogshit tech IPOs, but... Earnings were moved up to 10/28, before the lockout ends allowing insiders to dump their shares. Q2 earnings beat expectations though with shares at fucking *175* there was no room for further optimism at that time. Now with the stock sitting a little less pretty at 110 there could be more perceived room for upside. Not to mention Beyond will probably announce some new deal to try to juke the share price higher right before the end of lockout.\n\nShort volume/interest is not at all time highs but is still [significant enough](https://fintel.io/ss/us/bynd) for a potential squeeze. Add decent earnings/growth, some new roll-out deal, and all you need is a fund to recognize the potential for a squeeze-amplified pump and dump. This offers the chance for a pretty volatile couple days in the opposite direction of previous months' trends before the stock inevitably goes to shit where it belongs.\n\nSo: Calls 1 or 2 standard deviations out with 10/30 expiry? What am I missing?\n\n**(tl;dr: decent earnings + deal announcement + sneaky fund = short squeeze, why not buy some fucken calls?)**", "created_utc": 1571691693, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dl6vt8/bynd_calls/", "is_self": true}
