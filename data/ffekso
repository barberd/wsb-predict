{"id": "ffekso", "title": "Delta Short DD", "selftext": "I fly a lot. I am a million miler. \n\nMonday morning first flight from ATL to EWR - half full. I have never seen an empty seat on this flight in 15 years. This is a consultant / auditor / sales flight. \n\nMonday morning busiest airport in the world - not busy\n\nFriday afternoon EWR - ATL 3/4 of plane empty, the past 15 years this flight has never not been over booked. \n\nEWR was still gross and looks like it has never been cleaned. \n\nMy company just travel banned everyone (month of March) We live in airplanes. Now I got to see my family, fucking gross.\n\nEdit for the retarded: The point is road warrior travel is being impacted. Road warriors flew through sept 11th, recession, swine flue, and SARS. Companies are stopping road warrior travel. This is a new reaction to a black swan event.", "created_utc": 1583683650.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffekso/delta_short_dd/", "is_self": true}
