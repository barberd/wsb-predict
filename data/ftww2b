I have to start with a disclaimer that you shouldn't trust me, but I do have an Adderall prescription and your mom's phone number saved in my Favorites. \n\nI'm seeing a lot of comments about $20 loaves of bread and a general worry about impending hyperinflation. I'm no expert (which is why I expect you to all jump right on board with me) but here's why those comments sound like actual chunky word vomit to my 5th grade brain. Let's start with a clipped quote from [this article](https://mises.org/wire/why-world-has-dollar-shortage-despite-massive-fed-action). \n\n>The Federal Reserve has identified the Achilles heel of the world economy: the enormous global shortage of dollars. The global dollar shortage is estimated to be $13 trillion now \\[...\\]   \nIn the past 20 years, dollar-denominated debt in emerging and developed economies, led by China, has exploded. \\[...\\] Those countries now face more than $2 trillion of dollar-denominated maturities in the next two years and, in addition, the fall in exports, GDP and the price of commodities has generated a massive hole in dollar revenues for most economies.  \nIf we take the US dollar reserves of the most indebted countries and deduct the outstanding liabilities with the estimated foreign exchange revenues in this crisis \u2026 The global dollar shortage may rise from 13 trillions of dollars in March 2020 to $ 20 trillion in December \u2026 And that is if we do not estimate a lasting global recession.\n\nSo other countries have massive amounts of dollar-denominated bonds, and there aren't enough dollars floating around out there to pay up by the time they come due.  If you have a debt of dollars that you default on, suddenly those dollars... just don't exist. And what happens to the dollar when there are fewer of them? It becomes more valuable. \n\nBecause the Fed anticipates these defaults, it knows that pretty soon the world will have a lot fewer dollars in it. This gives the Fed room to print extra money without actually causing the value of the dollar to depreciate as much as one might expect. \n\nAdding to that, everyone else has been turning their money printers on as well, and their printers are even faster than ours. If they were to turn on their money printers and the Fed didn't, that would quickly bump up the relative strength of the dollar. But isn't a strong dollar good? You can buy more condoms for your wife's boyfriend with the same amount of money now, right? Not so fast. \n\nGenerally speaking, as the value of the dollar goes uppies, stonks go downsies. Come have a three-course lunch me with me, I just got my allowance from your mom:\n\n* Course one: 1 Wendy's Baconator costs $1\n* Course two: The dollar just got a buff because the other countries turned on their printers and are about to throw their dollar-denominated debts on a grill, so now 1 Baconator just went from costing $1 to only costing $0.65\n* Course three: In this analogy, 1 Baconator=1 stonk\n\nA strong dollar has advantages and disadvantages. It means imported goods get cheaper for Americans, but US exports are harder for other countries to afford, and US companies that do business elsewhere get cucked when their foreign operations are getting paid in the equivalent of cowrie shells and used panties. The Fed *wants* to keep the dollar down. This is intentional. \n\nSo to all the people predicting $20 loaves of bread, shut the fuck up already. \n\nAnd to all the people who know more than me, call me out. Like I said, I'm just a retard learning how to autate. \n\nPositions: doggy style if I'm in a hurry, or heels-on-shoulders if I'm trying to look your mom in the face for that intimate feeling", "created_utc": 1585869518.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ftww2b/a_monkeys_primer_to_the_money_printer/", "is_self": true}
