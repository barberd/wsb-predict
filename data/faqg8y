Yeah, I put it at the top, because a lot of you are a bunch of impatient, greedy, illiterate idiots.\n\nThis may be too late for some of you, but for all you autists out there looking for tendies. You don't need to find the next hidden money maker out there. You do not need to reinvent the wheel. Right now puts are printing. Buy puts on anything trending down, but looks like its recovering on the daily.\n\nOil is going down. Short XOP, COP, EOG or SLB, and if you're looking for a sleeper in that group buy puts on APA (since it hasn't gone down as much due to some serious gains in 2019/20).\n\nResorts/casinos and cruise lines are falling. CCL, RCL, NCLH for the cruise lines. CZR, LVS, WYNN for the casinos, Any time you see something showing a green arrow, there's a good chance, if you short it, (never mind, if you're poo like me, you're buying puts) it will print.\n\nForeign ETF's are falling faster now. EWG, EWJ, EWZ, TUR, EWX (thought I made that last one up and it's still falling). Look for something that hasn't dropped as much as the others and sho... buy puts on it.\n\nThese are not bargain basement prices, yet. There was a concerted effort by traders (Wall Street, those bastards, and WSB Bull Gang probably) to keep this above the 200 dma today and it failed. $TICK was above 1,000 repeatedly for an hour and SPY still could barely close half the gap. They bought it, and sold it.  Either at 1/2 of the gap, or if they were like us, once it hit their stop loss.\n\nI've got to admit that CCL is close to getting there since it's price to book is 0.86, but it still has another \\~15 points to go before it reaches the low in 09, so if you're short, you still have hope. CCL is going to be a test case for me at where I think RCL will target. Is it going to be 2014 lows, or the (very optimistic) 2009 lows?\n\nOn the weekly chart, we can still get down to $263 on SPY to reach the 200 weekly moving average. In case you didn't know, that's where we hit in December 2018, but it took 3 months to get there. This should be, and is a WSB wet dream. We're getting there fast. Short dated puts with no or little loss to that bitch Theta.\n\nYou should expect a relief rally (hedge with a small portion of LEAP calls), but I wouldn't be going all in on calls on anything just yet.", "created_utc": 1582871166, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/faqg8y/you_dont_need_to_be_digging_for_hidden_gems_to/", "is_self": true}
