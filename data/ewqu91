I have no idea how but /u/J_Powell_Ate_My_Ass managed to read the whole book yesterday and [not only write a review](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ewdd5x/wallstreetbets_how_boomers_made_the_worlds/fg35h89/) but also sent me a message with editorial suggestions.\n\nHere are a few of my favorite quotes from the book:\n&gt; To my knowledge, brokers haven\u2019t had the proper stress tests to withstand stampedes of high-risk thumb traders that aren\u2019t afraid of margin calls.\n\nand\n\n&gt; To put that into perspective, for every one dollar of value that exists in a share of a given company (the kind you can explain to a five-year-old), seventeen dollars exist in the acronym-laden, leveraged, counterparty dependent, and abstract variety that WSB uses for YOLO bets.\n\nand\n\n&gt; Simply put, fiscal responsibility is no longer a prerequisite for those looking to YOLO using complex and highly risky financial securities.", "created_utc": 1580487941, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ewqu91/wallstreetbets_book_now_available_in_paperback_as/", "is_self": true}
