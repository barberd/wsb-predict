{"id": "eseu6c", "title": "Potential Take over aerospace company", "selftext": "I have been watching this stock for about 6 moths and the chart is very similar to BREW who got acquired by Bud earlier last year. PKE is an aerospace materials company serving the esoteric end of the space and aerospace industry. It is a supplier to a number of aerospace and space-sector companies like KRATOS, LMT, MRAS, NOC, NASA, AJRD, BA just to name a few. The company is small with a market cap of 350 million but has paid big special dividends in the past and insider ownership seems to favor such shareholder distributions. I believe this company is highly undervalued and could sell for 1 Billion easy based on compacity and future contracts. PKE is both a growth company and dividend giant the earnings look strong and the balance sheet is clean 144 million in cash no debt. It is currently expanding the manufacturing facility in Wichita, Kansas. The facility expansion positions PKE to grow within its existing business. While PKE is actively seeking M&amp;A candidates stated by CEO at Nedham Growth Conference January 15 2020. PKE indicated that it is interested in expanding in ASIA but does not know how to enter that market by itself. The M&amp;A has not yielded any results but PKE will be patient and disciplined.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclosure: I am long PKE with shares and Calls", "created_utc": 1579712674, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eseu6c/potential_take_over_aerospace_company/", "is_self": true}
