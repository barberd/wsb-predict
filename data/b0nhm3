{"id": "b0nhm3", "title": "Can we talk about YETI?", "selftext": "Lots of buzz about this stock, but the hype honestly seems crazy irrational.  \n\n\nA few posts have mentioned the fact that the short interest is very high on this stock...\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/avrbn4/very\\_high\\_yeti\\_short\\_interest/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/avrbn4/very_high_yeti_short_interest/)\n\n...yet it keeps climbing.  \n\n\nI'd like to call attention to the fact that of the 84M shares outstanding:\n\n* About 42M are owned by  Cortec Group Fund V, L.P. and are not for trade.\n* 16M shares are owned by the founding brothers\n* 8M are locked behind employee stock programs ([https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1670592/000110465918063819/0001104659-18-063819-index.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1670592/000110465918063819/0001104659-18-063819-index.htm))\n\n  \nSo that leaves us with 18M shares left, and public info shows that there's a float of 15M, so it's in line. So if you're a Chad that wants a piece of the YETI action, you're competing with every other overlanding-bros for a piece of that 15M float pie. (Meanwhile the short interest on the float is now 68%).  \n\n\nSo my take on it is that Cortec and the brothers will hold onto their controlling power of the company, 8M shares that are currently locked behind employee incentive contracts (just think, there's employee based locked in compensation equal to 50% of the float right now!!!!) will be released to the masses and that supply will drive the price down.\n\nMeanwhile lets look at financials:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* This turd is trading at 38x P/E.\n   * A little context, AAPL is trading at 15x.\n* In their filing ([https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1670592/000104746918006818/a2236927zs-1a.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1670592/000104746918006818/a2236927zs-1a.htm)) they funded an increase in cash with a reduction in inventory, which is good. Inventory control is doing well. But there hasn't been any substantial change to their asset base in the same time. Net sideways.\n* Their liabilities were decreased funded by a reduction in shareholder equity. Net sideways.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just don't get it. Can someone help me understand this piece of shit stock?  \n\n\nFull disclosure, I have short positions on the stock and I'm getting murdered right now.", "created_utc": 1552492019, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b0nhm3/can_we_talk_about_yeti/", "is_self": true}
