The fed doesn't do forward guidance anymore - they are data dependent every month - so like every autismo here, they will forget the trend and just see if the numbers are good independently. I think it will be like the old adage, a watched pot will never boil. We might get 3.8% YoY CPI, wage growth at 5% YoY, unemployment at 2% before the Fed is finally like \"oh ok are you guys maybe ready for some tightening?\" like a timid virgin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe markets will call the Fed's bluff - essentially pushing everything up until we realize that 4% inflation is actually quite different from the 2% (right now) target. This, with the trade deal nearing completion, will take us higher than 3000. What wonderful times we live in. Money is just a number that the banks create. Once you get it, buy anything. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTSLA $420 Dec 2019", "created_utc": 1562863302, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cbxvdb/were_going_to_spx_4000_before_we_get_a_hike/", "is_self": true}
