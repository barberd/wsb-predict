{"id": "b8df39", "title": "My mom wants to buy me a 2019 BMW X6M. Should I just invest that and double my money and get a Huracan?", "selftext": "Title said it all.  I\u2019m in college and currently driving a 2017 C63 AMG but my mom wants to get me a more \u201cdurable\u201d car for the winter condition here. Because my AMG is rear wheel drive and it constantly spin out in the snow and she is worry about that. I was thinking instead of putting down 100k for a BMW why not invest it and double my money and get like a used Huracan to flex on these international kids at my school. I have invested a little more than 10k but lost it all because I couldn\u2019t wake up early at 9:30am to sell it on multiple occasions but it\u2019s not a big deal. Technically my mom never said I have to buy the BMW with this money and she wouldn\u2019t know if I got it or not since she is not even in the states. Should I risk it? My girlfriend said I\u2019m an idiot and ignored me but I think she will be happy with a Huracan in the end. Also my mom doesn\u2019t know this but my dad has been sending me 15k every month for expenses and if I do lose the 100k, I\u2019ll just have to lower my monthly expenses and start saving back up.", "created_utc": 1554173150, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b8df39/my_mom_wants_to_buy_me_a_2019_bmw_x6m_should_i/", "is_self": true}
