However, it is my entire Roth account. I would like to invest it in calls or puts to try to get at least that 400% sign. I'd then invest in a safe dividend mutual fund and retire. \n\nPuts on bynd, cgc, or calls on JCP?\n\nI believe in the \"law of large numbers\".  Whichever has the most upvotes, and isn't completely retarded (like MU 90 calls) I will buy.
