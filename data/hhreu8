{"id": "hhreu8", "title": "My GF and I's Portfolios are all Airline Stocks", "selftext": "Hi,\n\nMy GF decided to throw our money into a travel agency a few weeks ago. Things were going great until they weren't. We're down by 30% and she's mad at me now because her ex told her not to buy Airline stocks, and she's acting like it was my idea.\n\nAnyways, do we sell at 30% loss, or hope for a recovery? Is the stock market taking my gf away?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Just to clarify, these \"he's going to steal your gf\" replies are unnecessary. I know the dude and we're really good friends, he's stayed over at our house over the pandemic for a few weeks. There's no red flag in our relationship and there's no awkwardness that him and my gf dated before.
