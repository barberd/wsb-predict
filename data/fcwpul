{"id": "fcwpul", "title": "HPE Earnings", "selftext": "Tomorrow is HPE earnings before the bell, Q1 2020. This is one of the first tech companies to release their \u201ccorona virus\u201d earnings and will help show how severely the supply chain has been interrupted. They are more than likely going to announce canceling their presentations around the world as a precaution. But will also most likely show a hard slump in production, estimates say 4% drop in rev year to year. Historically whenever their rsi got this low, it\u2019s time to buy so I know a lot of people will be buying calls but I\u2019m investing the market once again and buying puts because anything they say will be amplified being one of the first techs to release q1 earnings. Asking here for opinions on what everyone thinks their earnings will hold for investors. On top of everything else they denied a deal from xerox due to the offering price being to low. Any opinions here?\n\nEdit: it\u2019s tonight after close sorry", "created_utc": 1583251478.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fcwpul/hpe_earnings/", "is_self": true}
