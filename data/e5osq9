I balanced my account at year end so I wouldn\u2019t get fucked by the tax man but made one fatal mistake. In mid January I bought back into all my old positions hard, without thinking how it would carry over 250k+ in unrealized loss from the year end bloodbath. Now I have a huge amount of realized gains in 2018 and hardly any realized losses. They were all carried over to 2019 due to those wash sales. Im in the terrible position of having 250k realized gains last year and 250k realized losses this year. I admitted my position to the IRS in my return for fear of negligent penalties for under reporting but haven\u2019t paid yet. I owe more in taxes then my account was worth at the end of 2018.\n\nWhat are my options for dealing with this tax bill? CPA? Attorney?
