{"id": "e9gos6", "title": "Square DD", "selftext": "If you have been on YouTube recently, at least for me, I have seen promoted videos of CashApp \u201chacks\u201d and various things to get free money. Of course, none of these work, and there are a plenty of other videos promoting these \u201chacks\u201d that don\u2019t work. Look up \u201cCashApp free\u201d on YouTube to see how many of these videos are being watched, with some reaching hundreds of thousands of viewers.\n\nThat being said, many retards are going to watch these videos and download CashApp to realize these bullshit hacks don\u2019t work. But hey, they still have the app. Why would they delete it. Maybe they start using it a ton, and all of a sudden CashApp has millions of additional Users and provides Square (who developed CashApp) with tons of bonus income. Thus, long square, and calls for days on their February earnings.", "created_utc": 1576114255, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e9gos6/square_dd/", "is_self": true}
