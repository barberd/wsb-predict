{"id": "fl3uhz", "title": "Can one of you rich fucks buy some long calls (you can ban, just read first) on $SNY. Broke ass med student.", "selftext": "$SNY manufactures Plaquenil, generic name hydroxychloroquine. Chloroquine, a similar drug, has been used in China empirically for the treatment of COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine was then used empirically South Korea. These drugs are malaria medications. It is suspected that they, hydroxychloroquine more so than chloroquine, act as a ionophore trasnporting Zinc, Zn2+, into the cell.\n\nWhy is this so fucking cool?\n1. It is know that Zn2+ inhibits RNA replicase, an enzyme needed for the replication of COVID-19 within the cell. The problem is Zn2+ does not transport through the cells phospholipid bilayer well due to its charge. Studies, in vitro, show Hydroxychloroquine significantly increases the transport of Zn2+ into the cell. Aka in theory it should fuck up corona which is why it is being used empirically.\n2. Hydroxychloroquine is cheap, old, and in abundance. Quite a few manufacturers produce the generic. The safety of the drug has already been established. \n3. $SNY has already begun trials of Praquenil for the treatment of COVID-19. Old news I know but it shows I'm not crazy. \n4. It was only 24 patients but recently a Italian physician published a paper she the decrease in the time a patient is contagious while on Hydroxychloroquine.\n5. I suspect a large demand for for hydroxychloroquine in the new future as more and more hospitals begin to use it to empirically treat their patients and as more evidence comes out. \n\nI could go on but I am probably banned by now. \n\nTLDR:\nBroke ass dyslexic med student with zero trading experience is recommended a call during the season of puts because he think his marginal undergrad degree and subpar medical school has thought him science.", "created_utc": 1584591816.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fl3uhz/can_one_of_you_rich_fucks_buy_some_long_calls_you/", "is_self": true}
