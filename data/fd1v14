FORCED SELLING, actually to curb forced selling.", "selftext": "The short and sweet answer to why lower rates are better in an environment like we see today is that in a downfall people over leveraged will get margin called at some point in a rapid decline. If I\u2019m holding a stock and it\u2019s falls to the point that I get margin called I can either sell or put more money in and this is where lowering interest comes into play simply bc the cheaper money is the better chance A LENDER will help bail out people getting margin called. It\u2019s a very macro effect but overall it is designed to LIMIT LOSSES because if there are more margin calls which is FORCED SELLING the markets fall further and much faster then anything most anyone has seen. \n\nOne of the smartest guys I\u2019ve seen on tv in awhile was some indian-American (I believe he was anyway) billionaire was on squeak box a week ago and he made a few excellent points about seeing outstanding gains by colleagues while he invested unlevered over the years. Those gains have been getting bigger and more outrageous lately. He was most worried about forced selling. Forced selling would be two or three times worse. It would be an accelerated drop. \n\nThat is what the fed is trying to put a backstop up for and nothing else IMHO\n\n* Indian guy also said this beers shit will last 8-9 months", "created_utc": 1583270927.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fd1v14/the_real_answer_to_why_the_fed_lowers_rates_in_an/", "is_self": true}
