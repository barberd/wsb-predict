{"id": "fh28g1", "title": "First hand DD of hotel business and virus", "selftext": "I own a few dozen upper mid scale hotels, all Marriott, Hilton, IHG wns Hyatt brands. They are located in various locations throughout 6 states. About 2 weeks ago I had all of my sales directors and managers start tracking all cancellations related to the corona virus. \n\nThey started last week with major conferences being cancelled and oversees tour companies visiting the national parks canceling as well. \n\nThis week things have accelerated with domestic travelers cancelling because they won\u2019t want to fly. \n\nWe typically do between 200k-300k in sales per day. We are building models to aggregate the data from all properties into one report so I can post exact numbers soon but it\u2019s looking like 20-30k per day in cancellations and it\u2019s getting worse by the day. \n\nOnce my numbers confirm that cancellations are slowing we might be near a bottom for travel companies. \n\nSo far we still have a long way down to go. \n\nA lot of hotel owners are going to be in deep shit. Hotel debt currently stands at over 300billion and if this continues more than a few months a lot of guys are no longer going to be able to service debt. \n\nIf they further restrict travel like they are in a few locations it\u2019s going to be really really ugly.", "created_utc": 1583952897.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fh28g1/first_hand_dd_of_hotel_business_and_virus/", "is_self": true}
