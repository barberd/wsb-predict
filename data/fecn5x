{"id": "fecn5x", "title": "How the economic downturn will develop: thoughts from someone who wrote about a serious global economic downturn one month ago", "selftext": "A month ago I posted a thread making the argument that the global economy would enter a serious downturn unless two things happened: 1) a treatment for the new coronavirus was developed immediately 2) a vaccine is developed by the next flu season\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/f1fm6y/the_world_economy_will_enter_a_serious_downturn/\n\nMy reasoning hinged on whether the characteristics of the virus was dangerous enough to change the behavior of economic actors. We've had past scares like H1N1 or ebola that didn't have any major impact. But my it seemed clear that the characteristics of this new virus was disruptive and dangerous enough to seriously affect the behavior of economic actors and thus negatively impact the economy as a whole. Here's some highlights of what was discussed:\n\n&gt;This is why I said for nCoV to \"blow over\", an affordable treatment needs to be developed pretty much right now. Think about it, who would unnecessarily risk a trip to the movies or take a vacation with the risk of a catching HIGHLY infectious disease that spreads in many ways and spreads asymptomatically and can outright KILL you at up to a 25% probability without hospitalization?\n\n&gt;**Affordable and effective treatment SOON and vaccines before the next flu seasons are crucial to avoiding lasting economic decline**\n\n&gt;But why would there be economic decline? Well, because people will change their behavior as long as the threat of the virus remains. Let's look at what industries will be affected:\n\n- All tourism industry related businesses in Asia will take a huge hit. I'm talking about airlines, hotels, tours, restaurants, tourist destinations, markets, etc.\n\n- Reports already show that business declined by as much as 80% in some tourism driven markets in Thailand. Overall air traffic in China has shrunk from over 17,000 daily flights to 5,000. Hotels, cruises, flights are getting canceled left and right.\n\n- **Many businesses that run on tight margins and those with complex supply chains and a Just-in-Time manufacturing strategy will be seriously hit by this and may even have to file for bankruptcy.** Let's take something like restaurants into consideration. The ones who specialize in deliveries may actually thrive in this market but most restaurants that depend on foot traffic or has high markups and depend on ambience to attract customers will suffer or shutter. They have to keep paying expensive rent and other overhead costs while customers may take months to slowly return. \n\n- **Expect a lot of businesses to start massive layoffs.** Vulnerable Asian airlines will be first. Many airlines like China Airline are already halting recruiting new flight attendants. Others like Cathay Pacific which has negative operating cash flow are asking their crew to take up to month long unpaid leave. They are canceling up to 50% of their flights stretching into at least march. How can they possibly remove the threat of this virus if no treatment/vaccine has been developed? The reason they are shutting down flights will therefore persist, and they will suffer a prolonged period of diminished business.\n\n- **America and the West will also feel the reverberations of China's hard fall.** The ways that the West's economy is tied to China's is too much to even try to list. But just understand that the biggest growth of profit over the last 20 years for many of the largest companies have come from China's consumer class. If that consumer class is not buying stuff, stocks will tank. Companies that spent the last 10 years using cheap debt to finance growth may go into bankruptcy when they are faced from such a drastic and sudden dip in their business. Expect all the weak poorly run businesses to get shaken up and many of them failing in the coming months. \n\n- There will be a feedback loop. There are many industries we can FOR SURE predict big problems for in 2020. We are guaranteed to see layoffs in airlines (especially Asian airlines) in the coming months. Set a reminder on this comment if you don't believe. I can even name you specific companies that will probably go bankrupt.\n\n- **Layoffs will compound upon itself. When airlines, hotels, restaurants, malls, etc are firing workers, the workers won't have money to spend on buying things. This means other businesses may suffer enough to also start firing some workers. Businesses in 2020 overall are so overleveraged that a large percentage of them are not going to be able to handle even a few months of lower business.** They simply can't pay all the expenses and the debt obligation.\n\n&gt;So if my logic and assumptions are correct, we are looking at an inescapable catastrophe for the Asian tourism industry at the very least. Just in Time manufacturing keep about 2 weeks worth of parts. Most businesses already adjusted their supplies to account for the normal Chinese New Year shutdown. We are now coming up on the limits of most JIT supplies. So expect some pretty bad news to be coming out this week and especially by later this month. I'm seeing pretty big dips in the stock market by April. Probably -15% by April and up to -35% by the end of the year. This will be our \"dip\".\n\nAfter I posted this thread, the market (American) went on to make record breaking all time highs. I believe a few things are responsible for this:\n\n- Capital flight from Asia\n\n- Monetary actions from China and other nations\n\n- Poor modeling of previous \"health scares\" including the much talked about \"V-shaped recovery\"\n\n- Use of lagging indicators. There is still news coming out of \"positive economic news\" like ones regarding unemployment.\n\n- Downplay of the virus by governments and international health organization WHO\n\n- Pure ignorance (this was the \"it's just the flu\" period)\n\nAfter a month, we've come to find out some more information about the virus. Some are bad but there are some good news as well.\n\n**Let's start with the good news:**\n\n- Various currently available drugs like Chloroquine have shown efficacy in treating infected patients. Don't expect peer reviewed studies anytime soon, this is just based on what was observed in China where health officials tried throwing all types of drugs at it until they noticed Chloroquine seems to work.\n\n- [Speculation] Heat and humidity may play a part in slowing the spread of the virus: see Singapore, India where they have tested a significant number of patients. Singapore is especially transparent and aggressive in finding cases. If they can contain this as a travel hub, then they may have a roadmap for our own containment once the weather warms. Other coronaviruses also slowed in heat\n\n- [Speculation] Diet may play a part in the spread of the virus. Indian diet rich in Curcumin/Turmeric may have an advantage in either fighting infection or dealing with the symptoms of infection. Hundreds of Indian students were evacuated from the epicenter of the Chinese outbreak and not a single one was infected after quarantine and testing.\n\n- Let's all hope the weather can give the Northern Hemisphere some much needed help in combating this virus (stay out of the Southern Hemisphere)\n\n**Now some bad news:**\n\n- [Controversial] The virus may have mutated at least once. The newer strain is more aggressive. This was a fear that was talked about in the thread from a month ago:\n\n&gt;RNA viruses like nCoV mutates extremely quickly. This means potential resistance or immunization from catching nCoV once may be lost if the virus mutates enough. This also means that there may never be permanent immunization. Any vaccine developed for it may only be effective for a portion of the mutations. And each flu season may bring many different strains of this virus that will be unaffected by developed vaccines. In other words, nCoV may be here to stay, much like other flu viruses.\n\n- It is being reported that it is possible to catch both strains at once (Chinese Journal National Science Review)\n\n- [Speculation] Guangdong reports up to 13% of patients tested positive for virus again weeks after \"recovering\". There are many possible explanations for this, some are benign but there have been several reports from health officials in various parts of China that they're seeing reinfection. Some viruses, the ones that target and manipulate the immune system response, cause more damage the second/third+ time of infection. Some diseases use our antibodies to cause more damage. \n\n- Patients who \"recovered\" from the virus including the recent man in his 30's die after recovery. There is lasting lunge damage in some patients. This means worse lunge function and injuries that allow for opportunistic infections.\n\n- WHO saying around 20% of infected cases require hospitalization. These patients have pneumonia and will drown in lunge liquid if they don't get on ventilators or as a worst case scenario ECMO machines. There are 300 ECMO machines in America. \n\n- Very little has been done to contain virus spread in America. Up to a few days ago, only 500 have been tested compared to tens of thousands in South Korea, a nation a fraction the size/wealth of us. For over a month since China shut its country down, we didn't even have a working test kit. The earlier one was defective.\n\n**Will things get better or worse?**\n\n- For America, things will get much worse before it gets better.\n\n- This is not like the previous financial crises. With financial crises, we didn't have overrun healthcare systems, quarantines, and persistent danger of dangerous infectious disease to worry about. The economic impact will be dragged out because of the nature of this virus.\n\n- The biggest danger is that this virus mutates into more strains. This makes vaccination far less effective. If this virus retains its deadliness and persists as a seasonal flu, then we are looking at a potentially permanent shift in human behavior. Entire industries will stop existing because large gatherings of people is too dangerous to continue. This is a heavy dose of speculation but it is also founded in very real possibilities. This virus has a massive evolutionary advantage in that it can spread asymptomatically for up to weeks. This means unlike far \"deadlier\" coronaviruses like SARS and MERS, this virus can continue killing at the same rate without risking burning itself out. SARS and MERS showed symptoms too quickly and killed too much and destroyed its own transmission opportunities by killing or incapacitating the host. This virus has decoupled transmission from keeping the host alive or at least relatively well.\n\n- Imagine what industries are no longer possible if the seasonal flu puts 10-20% of infected people in the hospital. That's the very real potential if this virus mutates into more strains.\n\n**Further thoughts**\n\nI am running out of time writing this so I will give some direct bullet point thoughts on how things will develop. Please try to think about this pandemic critically and organically. **Do not use models from previous recessions because this is fundamentally different from financial crises.** Misapplying models is what led to the \"v-shaped recovery\" consensus that was briefly reached last month. This virus and its mutation has the potential to have lasting fundamental changes on economic actor behavior.\n\nStream of consciousness below:\n\n- As stated last month, massive layoffs and bankruptcies in the Airline industry will occur.\n\n- Many airlines will be bailed out, but equity holders will likely get wiped out\n\n- Biggest problem with airlines is they leveraged to meet booming demand, billions upon billions spent on airplanes that are generating zero revenue while grounded. Airlines lose money maintaining servicing and storing grounded planes. Cathay has half its fleet on the ground.\n\n- Casinos are the hidden big losers industry. They will lose far more than they have already lost. Casinos don't do well in recessions and will do especially poorly because of the virus. They will be trading for pennies on the dollars. They have similar problems as airlines: leverage to meet booming demand, huge overhead and debt service once the casinos stop generating revenue. Unlike grounded planes, at least casinos will get SOME kind of money out of their property. Not enough to cover expenses and debt but it's better than literally nothing.\n\n- Oil industries will be heavily impacted.\n\n- Different breakeven points for different oil extraction operations.\n\n- The most expensive North American oil extraction stops being profitable below $50\n\n- If oil prices hit $30, expect any type of fracking operations to pretty much stop.\n\n- All the towns/cities/local governments depending on this industry for tax revenue is in big trouble. And so are their municipal bonds.\n\n- States or even the federal government may need to bail out the industry.\n\n- States may need to bail out local governments.\n\n- If you are in Texas, New Mexico, OK or anywhere with oil related industry, get prepared for the local economic impact of laid off workers and less spending\n\n- The virus retains high infectiousness in the 50's to low 60's temperature. Check your local forecast to see when the weather gets hotter than that. Spread will likely slow past those temperatures.\n\n- Japan may be pushed into a massive economic crisis. They have the most unbelievable government debt levels of large developed economies. The triple hit of canceled Olympics, lack of tourism, and local recession may finally pop their debt bubble.\n\n- Keep eyes on Singapore for hope of containing virus\n\n- The more hosts this virus has, the more likely it mutates\n\n- Almost all economic data are lagging, don't use lagging data to affirm that things are better than they currently or will be in the future. Conversely, once an inflection point is hit, don't look at lagging economic data to be pessimistic about the future.\n\n- News from China are leading sources of data. News from Europe/Americas are lagging. See what happened in China to predict what will happen in the West (my original post and prediction came from following what happened in China)\n\n- Huge supply shock in some sectors = extreme inflation. There's plenty of opportunity here if you can gather the correct information.\n\n- Huge demand shock = distorted spending on alternatives. Can't go to the movies/concerts? Pay for games and home entertainment\n\n- Private jail industry will likely be devastated. This virus has shown to spread like wildfire among confined populations (Chinese jails and Korean psych ward). Almost 100% of patients were infected in Korean psych ward. The private jail industry will need a bailout.\n\n- Switch from big ticket luxury items to small luxuries. Entrepreneurs get ready to pivot to small luxuries.\n\n- Assuming threat of virus is gone, expect economic transition period of 3 years before we enter boom economy. Adjust the industries you invest in accordingly.\n\n- A lot of companies will go bankrupt or get bailed out. The bailouts come in many forms. Some type of loan payment freeze for entire industries (like tourism) is possible. Freeze on tax collection from businesses is likely. Helicopter money into consumer hands. Or outright bailouts like what we saw with some companies in 2008.\n\n- Most vulnerable and overleveraged companies will go under first.\n\n- Not the type of market to \"buy the dip\" because even financially secure companies may get wiped out in some industries.\n\n- Mass unemployment/underemployment. If you are in the most vulnerable businesses (tourism/travel), try to transition right now if you can. Have a plan to not have a job by May\n\n- The CFR is likely lower than reported. WHO has CFR at above 3%. But many countries like America are not testing to find everyone with virus. So the CFR is exaggerated from an unrepresentative sample. CFR may be well below 1%, but if enough are infected, the medical system will be overwhelmed and the CFR will quickly rise to the ~20% (those who require hospitalization to survive from severe/critical symptoms).\n\n- Governments should seek to reinforce vital functions (food supply, utilities, medical service)\n\n- Governments should seek to have comprehensive stimulus policies in place (US should seek high return investments like infrastructure)\n\n- Central Banks are in big trouble. If banks are afraid to raise rates during a supposed \"booming\" economy, what will they do now? \n\n- Negative effective rates equates to a massive wealth transfer\n\n- Real negative rates is an even bigger wealth transfer\n\n- Timing the market may be tricky because of central bank and government actors. But the direction is negative.\n\nIf I can leave with one last thought on this virus, it is the fact that **this virus is 100% capable of creating a new paradigm, a new normal, in human civilization.** \n\nThe mutations of this virus is key. This virus is uniquely positioned in mutating in ways that will fundamentally change human civilization. It can spread asymptomatically for up to weeks. That's our biggest problem. If it retains this characteristic, then there will be MUCH LESS evolutionary selection pressure for more benign strains of the virus. Remember that with viruses like MERS and SARS, they defeat themselves by showing symptoms too quickly and killing too much. They prevent themselves from being spread. But with this new virus, they can be as dangerous and deadly as they wish to evolve/mutate into, as long as they continue to be asymptomatic while infectious, their deadliness won't play a big factor in their persistence. They can still spread easily.\n\nRemember that of the two strains of this virus published in the Chinese Journal, the NEWER strain is the more aggressive one. Viruses can mutate into deadlier strains just as they can more benign ones. Unlike other diseases, there's no big natural selection pressure for the more benign version of this virus.", "created_utc": 1583496956, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fecn5x/how_the_economic_downturn_will_develop_thoughts/", "is_self": true}
