I know the virus hit the airline industry hard but I dont believe the company's worth half as much all of a sudden because of a temporary issue. \n\nThe coronavirus will eventually go away and when it does and air traffic resumes as normal, I have a hunch there's going to be a huge correction in stocks like AAL and other travel companies who have seen their shares drop drastically because of coronavirus. \n\nSure their profits are going to decrease and what not however I feel like the results of the virus are being grossly over-exaggerated on their stock and could cause a drastic correction.", "created_utc": 1583522448, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/feilcv/future_for_airline_stock/", "is_self": true}
