They have now, for a second week, shown their inability to function as a competent broker. I started transfer of funds last week to both ETrade and TOS (so I can test and see which one I enjoy using more). TOS is certainly not the most user friendly and will seem like a lot to take in (especially coming from RH) but it can be really useful and WILL WORK DURING VOLATILE TIMES. ETrade is also good, coming from RH would be an easy transition and its a simple interface. Do not let RH continue to handle your hard earned dollars, move your money to a broker that will function. I lost another $1100 today because they couldnt fill a sell order with some of the funds I had left in my account during my tranfers. DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT IT, JUST LEAVE ROBINHOOD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; STOP BEING A FULL RETARD AND MOVE YOUR MONEY TO FIDELITY, TOS, ETRADE or LITERALLY ANYONE BUT ROBINHOOD...", "created_utc": 1583785394, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fg15pa/leaving_robinhood_for_a_competent_broker/", "is_self": true}
