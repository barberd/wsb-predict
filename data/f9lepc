I used long term (daily) charts and tick by tick data to time my entry.\n\nTendie factors included you guys and your leverage are driving up volatility.  This means spikes in either direction are the new norm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhere from here? \n\nI expect a bounce tomorrow.  Longer term I expect sideways for a bit (60% chance) or further down (40%).  Long long term - we are up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will add to my position as we move sideways or (hope not) down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy not options?\n\nJob does not allow it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy not 3x ETF?\n\nNot a good idea.  This is a pullback - not blood in the streets.  Leveraged ETFs are very path dependent. If you enter on 3x vs 2x and we get another drop the 2x will outperform the 3x.  Save that 3x for later (and hope you don't need to use it).", "created_utc": 1582681512, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9lepc/why_i_bought_the_dip_confessions_of_a_boring/", "is_self": true}
