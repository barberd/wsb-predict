But that was outweighed by a steep decline  in other categories as businesses shuttered and shoppers restricted  their spending.  \n>  \n>The Commerce Department\u2019s preliminary report showed a seasonally adjusted drop of 8.7 percent  from February\u2019s total sales, which include purchases in stores and  online, auto and gasoline sales, and money spent at bars and  restaurants.  \n>  \n>Even those bleak figures  don\u2019t fully capture the economic deep freeze. Most states didn\u2019t issue  shutdown orders to nonessential businesses until late March or early  April, meaning data for the current month could be worse still.  \n>  \n>Until  now, the largest one-month downturn in retail sales came in the fall of  2008, when the financial crisis led spending to fall nearly 4 percent  for two straight months.", "created_utc": 1586954214.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1r3ln/nytimes_us_retail_sales_suffer_biggest_plunge_on/", "is_self": true}
