{"id": "eqk1x9", "title": "In Regards to WSB's Takeover of Detroit (Free Money Inside)", "selftext": "There was a post a few days ago from a stable genius about purchasing the 1k homes in Detroit to create an autist shrine. I'm a cuck and my boss made me come in on a Saturday, so I decided to do some more DD on this investment opportunity. I created an account at [buildingdetroit.org](https://buildingdetroit.org) and it turns out that Detroit city employees can get these homes for 50% off. The land itself has to be worth more than $500. I am proposing that the WSB community apply for positions within the Detroit city government. First, we need to get some autists to work in the HR department. An unlimited amount of positions could be created within the government.  We are also going to need some autists to work in the tax department so that we can get rid of the tax liens. There also seemed to be some concern about the asbestos issue in the original thread. The asbestos would give us access to mesothelioma money you always hear about on TV, which could, in turn, be yeeted back into the market. I don't see how this could go tits up.", "created_utc": 1579371604, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eqk1x9/in_regards_to_wsbs_takeover_of_detroit_free_money/", "is_self": true}
