If you can get enoug blood back in your system to restore your eyesight for long enough to read the rest of the list, you'll also see that the balance of the ETF is fairly favorable as well.\n\nThe larger holdings are placed in companies that are either in growth mode(SE, HUYA, AFREECATV), or are generally healthy companies in likely underbought conditions(ATVI, HEAR), with some other nice companies sprinkled in. Some of the lower holdings present some risk, but since they are a relatively small share, I am not really concerned about it.\n\nI will be taking a sizable(for me) position for E3 with anticipation of run-up during the conference, and a sell off immediately after. Once that happens I will likely sell NERD short term, then re-buy once I find another entry point.\n\nAnyways I figured most of you NERDS(nailed it) probably missed the launch of the ETF in-between AMD FDs so I wanted to make sure that was on y'all's radar so I'm not losing money on this ETF by myself next week.", "created_utc": 1560016320, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/byal7q/for_those_of_you_looking_to_play_stonks_at_e3_a/", "is_self": true}
