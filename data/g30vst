They rocketed their growth through [clever social advertising](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX7Afve778_kuhkGXm0RsCg) that has seen hundreds of millions of view over the years.  Just before going public through an SPAC in February 2018 (a very bad move for them to use an SPAC... part of the reason why coverage of their stock has been poor), they started exploring wholesale relationships, primarily with Mattress Firm (MFRM).  They have since aggressively expanded their wholesale relationships to 1,700 doors with various partners (see below), which has driven significant EBITDA improvement (wholesale is more bottom line profitable due to no DTC acquisition costs, although it does drive lower revenue per unit), to the point where PRPL has been ***manufacturing capacity constrained*** since some time last year.  According to [news appearances by the CEO](https://www.nasdaq.com/videos/silicon-slopes%3A-joe-megibow-ceo-purple) and [the Q4 earnings call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/03/13/purple-innovation-inc-prpl-q4-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx), ***Purple sells every mattress they make AND expect to be able to continue to do so***.   CEO Joe Megibow:  \" So I mean so far, as best as we've been able to prove out, there is still significantly more demand out there than our capacity to produce\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Actuals (MM)|2019 Q4|2019 Q3|2019 Q2|2019 Q1|2018 Q4|2018 Q3|2018 Q2|2018 Q1|2017 Q4|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Revenue|$124.3|$117.4|$103.0|$83.6|$78.5|$70.8|$75.8|$60.8|$63|\n|YoY %|58.3%|65.8%|36.0%|37.7%|24.5%|26.4%|58.1%|102.4%|156.1%|\n|||||||||||\n|Adj EBITDA|$5.8|$15.3|$6.2|$6.2|$(3.7)|$(2.7)|$(3.5)|$(0.8)|$(3.2)|\n|Net Income|$(12.7)\\*|$8.4|$(7.3)|$(0.7)|$(5.4)|$(4.4)|$(5.6)|$(4.3)|$(4.6)|\n\n\\*Includes a $13.4M non-cash loss associated with the change in fair value of warrant liabilities.  Discussed below.\n\nPurple's growth into cash generation has been phenomenal over the last two years, largely fueled by the very profitable wholesale relationships.   Their revenue growth significantly outpaces their full competitive set, as seen below.   Their Net Income outpaces Casper (CSPR), their closest comparable and the \"other\" new publicly traded bed-in-a-box brand.  PRPL stock experienced a repricing when Casper (CSPR) announced their IPO earlier this year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Comparable to CSPR**\n\nMarket Cap (as of 4/16/2020)\n\nPRPL:  $468.3M\n\nCSPR:  $300.3M\n\nDespite signficantly better financial performance and upside, PRPL is currently priced only 55.9% better than CSPR, whose cash reserves were measured in months before COVID-19.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|*Revenue ($ MM)*|Pre-COVID Guidance|*2019*|*2018*|*2017*|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|CSPR|$108-$112 (Q1)|$439.3|$357.9|$250.9|\n|PRPL|$550-$575|$428.4|$285.8|$196.9|\n\nCSPR is slightly larger as of the end of 2019, but PRPL has significantly greater revenue acceleration.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Net Income *($ MM)*|Pre-COVID Guidance (Adj EBITDA)|*2019*|*2018*|*2017*|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|CSPR|$(30)-$(27) (Q1)|$(93.0)|$(92.1)|$(73.4)|\n|PRPL|$44-$49 (FY)|$(12.4)\\*|$(19.6)|$(8.8)|\n\nCSPR is burning cash like the dumpster fire that it is.   Excepting for a non-cash expense that, in my opinion, should be actually viewed as equity, PRPL would have been net income breakeven for the year and EBITDA positive for the last four quarters.\n\n**Warrant Liability Increase Driving Down the Bottom Line**\n\nI don't want to get into a FASB debate with you, but treating value increases of [warrants](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1643953/000121390019007779/fs32019a1_230522purple.htm)  issued with their debt refinancing as an effective expense instead of the equity that it is, is just garbage accounting policy.  Every competent investor should treat those warrants in their calculations of equity (along with the PRPLW warrants), EBITDA per share, and earnings per share.  Regardless, due to COVID, those warrants are materially down in market value, so we may see a favorable adjustment to earnings for Q1.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Guidance for 2020**\n\nOn the [Q4 earnings call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/03/13/purple-innovation-inc-prpl-q4-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx), CEO Joe Megibow admitted that guidance was very conservative for the year (aka sandbagged) when he admitted: \"We have the capacity we need to meet our sales goals for the year.\"  Per Joe, with an additional 40% increase in manufacturing capacity (from 2019 capacity) \"coming online later in the year..., that's upside potential, and ***we will sell every mattress we make as we always have***. That's ***upside potential late in the year***, but that's also building up the capacity we need into the expected growth into 2021.\"   The team was planning for 20% upside to their guidance (40% capacity for the last half of the year by my estimate).\n\nThis 40% in planned capacity increase (from 2019 capacity) is in additional to the 40% increase in capacity that comes from Mattress Max machines 6 & 7 that have already been executed against.   From the call:  \" Again, 6 and 7 will be up imminently. We said 6 would be up by the end of Q1 and 7, early Q2. We're clearly on that path right now.\"   Lastly, [Joe previously announced](https://www.nasdaq.com/videos/silicon-slopes%3A-joe-megibow-ceo-purple) operational efficiency improvements to bring capacity up a total of 100% by the end of 2020 (40% capacity due to machines 6 & 7, which are complete, 40% due to machines 8 & 9, and 20% due to efficiencies).\n\nThe planned 2020 capex of approximately $40M is largely attributable to PP&E used to create the additional 28.6% in capacity (mattress max machines 8 & 9).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**COVID Updates and Cash Preservation**\n\nDuring the Q4 earnings call, Joe summarized their supply chain risk due to COVID as: \" as of right now, we don't see any critical bottlenecks of any kind.\"   This is because they do their own manufacturing in the US.\n\nOn 3/26, similar to many other companies, [PRPL withdrew its guidance for the year](https://investors.purple.com/file/Index?KeyFile=403411085).  PRPL stated at this time that more than half of its wholesale doors had closed, but that its online business had increased year over year.   Keep in mind, PRPL had been pulling back substantially on its online business in the second half of 2019 to service its wholesale business, so this is a marked acceleration in digital.\n\nOn Monday 4/13, [PRPL gave additional guidance](https://investors.purple.com/file/Index?KeyFile=403589988) on their COVID activities.   Wholesale continued to decline due to wholesale location temporary closures, but digital revenue was pacing at a 35% YoY increase over Q1 2018 ([Digital Revenue was 64% of Q1 2018 Revenue or $53.5M](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/edited-transcript-prpl-earnings-conference-051110542.html)), which means the team is on track for $72.2M in digital revenue for Q1.   In addition to this Q1 digital revenue, as of the [March 9 Q4 earnings call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/03/13/purple-innovation-inc-prpl-q4-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx), PRPL had \"not yet seen any impact and are hopeful any future impact will be minimal\" from COVID in regards to sales revenues.   This means that the team saw the full wholesale revenue for 2/3s of Q1 and half of wholesale revenue for the last 1/3.  So far, **the net loss to revenue has not been catastrophic in the least**.  Q1 should be solid.\n\nTo hedge, PRPL has gone into cash preservation mode using \"this increase in digital demand we've experienced \\[to allow\\] us to work through a significant portion of our on-hand inventory\".   35% of their workforce was furloughed (so we assume a temporary 35% drop in manufacturing capacity).  Interest was deferred, compensation of executives reduced, and capital projects delayed, which all mean that PRPL is well prepared to weather the storm with its $26M cash on hand as of 3/31.\n\n# HERE IS WHERE IT GETS REALLY FUN\n\n**Wholesale sales resiliency**\n\nAssuming the US begins to open up, over the next few weeks, ***PRPL will be able to recover ALL of its sales for the year up to its manufacturing capacity***.   Here is why:  it only occupies 30.9% of its disclosed wholesale doors as of 12/31 (1,800 doors per Q4 earnings call out of a potential 5,825 doors of known partners).  Per the Q4 earnings call, PRPL simply needs to add 900 doors (which partners are eager to do) to meet its full year plan, or an increase from 30.9% of doors to 46.4% of doors.\n\nList of Partners from the Q4 earnings call:\n\n* Mattress Firm (3,420 locations total--great relationship here and expansion has been limited by manufacturing capacity--PRPL is only in 800 per Q3 call)\n* Macy's (770 locations total -> reducing by 125)\n* Bloomingdales (38 locations total)\n* Furniture Row (330 locations total)\n* Home (188 locations total)\n* Bed Bath & Beyond (1,024 locations total)\n* Steinhafels (18 locations total)\n* Mathis Brothers (20 locations total)\n* Raymour & Flanigan (142 locations total)\n\n***PRPL has many more potential partners***.  Additionally, per the earnings call when asked about further partner expansion, Joe responded:  \" We believe there's still significant opportunity for expansion and are nowhere near a point that we're cannibalizing from any one channel to each other or from any one retailer to another.\"\n\nHe later added: \" Right now, for the prior comments, we are still feeling more demand than we've been able to meet. We have many more partners. I mean, honestly, we're at a point right now that when we speak with other retail channel partners, it's not where it started years ago, which is, \"Hey, we'll throw it in 10 stores and see how it goes.\" If they want to work with us, they typically want to go fleet wide. So it's really just making sure we've got the capacity to support a major regional player as we look at that. Again, right now, we have some existing retailers like Mattress Firm, that there's still plenty of opportunity for expansion. And we're making sure that we are leveraging our existing players first.\"\n\n***To fully sell out its manufacturing capacity for the year, PRPL simply needs to expand the number of wholesale doors it is servicing***, which, per the Q4 earnings call, it can easily do.  Because PRPL can fully meet sales plan at 46.4% of doors, ***those doors can have more than a 50% reduction in consumer demand*** (especially considering that Q1 was already baked) ***and PRPL will still make numbers***.  This doesn't even include the benefit of the digital acceleration seen due to COVID.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Macro Trends in Mattresses**\n\nThe US mattress market on one report was $17.3B forecasted to grow to $18.9B by 2023.   Per PRPL Q4 Earnings Call, Purple estimates that they only have 2.5% market share.  There are somewhere around [200 other bed-in-a-box mattress companies](https://www.consumerreports.org/mattresses/is-a-bed-in-a-box-right-for-you/) crowding the digital space.   Purple's ability to stand out due to its unique product offering in a crowded space is well proven at this point.   Its opportunity to expand in digital will only accelerate as its competitors begin to drop like flies.\n\nPre-COVID, private equity markets took a marked turn late last year and early this year with the WeWork, Casper, and Outdoor Voices fiascos.   Investors are no longer willing to pay for growth at all costs.   This has forced cash-burning DTC brands to get desperate in acquiring more funding, including down rounds and poorly timed IPOs (looking at you Casper).\n\nWith COVID, we should expect to see many of these upstart digital competitors to fall out, which will improve digital advertising efficiencies for PRPL in the intermediate term.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Near Term Trend**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z00pr80kddt41.png?width=1167&format=png&auto=webp&s=76e1fc7bbc86266cee0a4179341baf58b3f0df3b\n\nI expect PRPL to return to the $12-$14 range before earnings on 5/12, and then to hit $20-24 by the end of Q1 2021.\n\nThis means PRPLW warrants should be in the range of $1.80-$2.20.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am long 530,038 PRPLW warrants and very bullish for PRPL as a solid COVID recovery stock.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pzwexn7zldt41.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=91e3e8209a0a1482b32dd96f0c97ef27a734670d", "created_utc": 1587125837.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g30vst/covid_recovery_play_prpl_to_1214_by_512_and_2024/", "is_self": true}
