He comin' to Ra**p**e Your S**p**y\u00a0**P**uts\"\n\nFirst off, unlike the vast majority of the inbred retards that found their way to WSB from 4chan hentai porn forums after seeing photoshopped get-rich-quick posts - I actually have a business.\u00a0 A real life business, with 30 employees, an office, company vehicles and assets and several million in revenue.\n\nI know the mouth-breathing neckbeards who are living in their parents basement and posting about their Robinhood tendies will ask for proof - because they can't imagine anyone in the real world would actually visit this cesspool.\u00a0 Well fuck you.\u00a0 I'm not posting my financials, pictures of my wife, kids and house just to satisfy some mouthbreathers who gamble away their parents' money. I'm just going to drop some knowledge about what's coming down the pike in the next few weeks.\n\nSo let me tell you what's about to happen to small businesses across the country.\u00a0 JPow and Steven Munchkin have just opened up a massive money printing machine, and it's flowing into businesses like mine starting on Friday 4/3.\n\nThe PPP loan is amazing.\u00a0 Incredible even - I haven't ever seen anything like it.\u00a0 Here are a few features:\n\n* Automatic approval for 2.5x monthly payroll (around $300k for my company)\n\n* 0.5% interest rate\n\n* 6 months deferred payments\n\n* 48hr turnaround funding time, according to my banker\n\n* No collateral\n\n* No personal guarantee\n\n* No underwriting\n\n* Best of all: **IT'S 100% FORGIVABLE**\n\nThat's right.\u00a0 If you spend at least 75% of it on payroll in this program, the loan becomes entirely forgivable.\u00a0 That's literally hundreds of thousands of risk free dollars the Fed is direct depositing into my account, just the privilege of losing money in my S-Corp this year.  My banker is inundated with calls, they are literally putting business owners on a money printing waitlist like we're in a breadline at the soup kitchen. And this isn't even counting the Economic Injury Disaster loans the SBA is fully funding.\n\nJPow, Munchkin and Congress just hit the BRRRR button and this economy is going pull a massive, gaping V, larger than your moms syphilis factory when she squeezed you out onto the tile floor in the Waffle House bathroom. But not until after we see the full effects of daily news broadcasts of 6 figure bodybag counts over the next 60 days.\n\nTLDR: Spy 205p 5/15.\u00a0 Then, fellow retards, ride the unlimited money rebound to infinity and beyond", "created_utc": 1585811428.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fthtbl/ppp_coming_to_fuck_you_up/", "is_self": true}
