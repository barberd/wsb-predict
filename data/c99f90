{"id": "c99f90", "title": "Why should I not trade with a personal loan?", "selftext": "I'm on the fence about this, which probably means I'm trying to convince myself to do something dumb.  I don't have a ton of free capital, but I do have equity and a great credit score.  I had this idea of getting a personal loan of $25K from the bank and using it (and maybe the margin too) to load up on something in the AMD range of price and volatility.  60 month loan at 7% is $500/month.  Then just write calls as a main source of gains.  I can make a few thousand a month off premiums.  Stock goes up, great.  Stock goes down, buy them back cheap and sell again.  I'm confident enough in AMDs long term outlook of neutral to positive.  I'm not sure if I'd use margin, I know it's generally a bad idea for long term holds.  Anyone know which broker has the best margin interest rates by the way?\n\nWhat's the worst thing about this plan?", "created_utc": 1562284822, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c99f90/why_should_i_not_trade_with_a_personal_loan/", "is_self": true}
