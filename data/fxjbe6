I know that after this virus debacle he was desperately seeking a win and he lives to create a headline so I presume he used every bit of that stimulus already and he's going to tout the recent market gains as an easter miracle. I think after this weekend the party stops, especially if my man Boris kicks the bucket.\n\nWe have got to be right about at the top right before a precipitous drop with no safety measures remaining. I have been a gay bear from the start of this thing but I was only dipping a toe in this shit before. I'm about to start wearing assless chaps and sucking a lolipop starting tomorrow at 3:55pm cuz it's time to go balls deep.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: SPXU MAY 15th $30 calls\n\n\nEdit: alright guys, I can't answer everyone so I'm gonna post my question up here. If they can just print whenever however much they want why did they allow the market to fall 30% before deciding to print? Why isn't SPY at $500 yet?", "created_utc": 1586396050.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxjbe6/get_your_puts_ready_its_bout_to_get_ghey_out_chea/", "is_self": true}
