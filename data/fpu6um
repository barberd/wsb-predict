Going forward, it should be much easier\n\nER will be released on Monday AH and cc on Tuesday @8:30a\n\nVFF has a jv for weed in cad and jv for hemp in the states. They were traditionally a veggie grower for 30yr prior to getting into weed in 2017. As a result, they have been selling veggies to all the big box stores (walmart, wholefoods, trader joes, kroger, etc) for years and the expectation is that they will be able to sell cbd products there as well. \n\nQ4 is the first full quarter that they've been selling weed online (ontario). Prior to that, they were mostly wholesale while waiting on their license from healthcare Canada. \n\nThey have a handful of products but 2/5 top selling strains on ocs belong to them with the #1 strain (by dollar and volume) being their Kush brand in q4. They recently announced that number rose to 2/4 for the first 2mo of q1 and that they now have a 13% market share on ocs. \n\nThey are the lowest indoor producer at .49/g (expecting a little higher in q4 due to seasonal cost: lighting, heat, etc)\n\nThey should also have hemp sales after harvesting about 1m lbs in 2019 in the states\n\nEst: .01 for q4\n\nI'm expecting closer to .08\n\n2020 will be a game changer for them with them doubling their grow facility (1.1m sqft to 2.2m by end of year; prod capacity goes from 75000kg to 150000kg of weed) and their cbd strategy coming online. We know covid has increased sales in weed across the board and there are now rumors that it will expedite legalization in the US as states look for other sources of revenues. \n\nShares out is low (about 60m) and CEO owns about 10m sh (~17%)\n\nMod: i didn't see an earnings flair so just marked discussion.
