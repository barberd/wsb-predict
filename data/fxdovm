But if, you are here and looking for a sustainable way to generate cash, keep reading.**\n\nFirst, There isn't any good in being perma bears or bulls that is so fucking stupid the only gang that you want to join is **PRINTING GANG**.\n\nSecond, This is what I made today [+1,193.36](https://i.imgur.com/zPHP6fv.jpg), you see how I only make 1 trade? I don't see any entry point so I didn't do anything all day, Sometime BEST POSITION IS NO POSITION and This year so far [+$425,443.23](https://i.imgur.com/AJpVbm1.png) which on average I made 3.42% per trade so **DON'T GET FUCKING GREEDY** and **TAKE THE MOTHERFUCKING PROFIT**. Not every trade is a win, you can't win them all but if you can make 3.5% per trade and you do that 20 times in a day. You will double your initial money. I did that many times [Sample 1](https://i.imgur.com/4bAg7BQ.jpg) [Sample 2] (https://i.imgur.com/4RsOUtZ.jpg).\n\nThird, During high VIX time. The only 2 ways to make money which either YOU SELL THE OPTIONS or YOU DAY TRADE. If you don't have $25k then I'm sorry this game is not for you.\n\nFourth, I have day traded options for about 14 years since I was 22. Right now the market is **ONCE IN A LIFETIME** opportunity. Like my man EMINEM once said *\"Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity, To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment, Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo\"* so don't let it fucking slip.\n\n**DO**\n\n - Get in and get out don't be fucking greedy.\n - Have an entry and exit price in mind before you open the fucking trade. So learn how to cut losses and take the profit.\n - If you made a bad trade. Get the fuck out, cut losses and try again, Don't fucking bagholding it and pray. God is not real. Santa is also not real.\n - Learn your greeks if you don't know what it is just fucking BING IT.\n - Once you have closed your position. Just fucking forget about it. Don't look back. Move on to the next trade. HINDSIGT IS ALWAYS 20/20.\n - Keep in your mind that if you trading options without any underlying then you are **GAMBLING**. This is not investing and stop calling your bankroll \"portfolio\".\n - If you are degenerate gambler like me this is what I do with my bankroll. I put whatever I feel comfortable losing in my trading account. The rest I keep in my checking account (separate institution). So when my retard brain tell me to do stupid shit, I don't lost it all. By the time I need to move more money into my bankroll, my head will be cleared (hopefully) and stop doing stupid shit.\n\n**DON'T**\n\n - **DON'T GAMBLE MORE THAN YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE** It's sad that I have to say this. Use the fucking money on important first, rent, mortgage, car payment, food, etc.\n - DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT be **H**orrified **O**f **M**issing **O**ut. Just remember that it is better making no money than losing money so assess the market before make a fucking trade.\n - Don't fucking all in, this is not a world poker series. There is no such a thing as a sure trade.\n - Don't take any DD with face vaule. DO YOUR OWN FUCKING RESEARCH. DD on here is just your starting point. It stands for DUE DILIGENCE for christ sake not DONE DEAL.\n - If you win on one trade. It is already your money. Don't use your tard brain and think that now you are gambling with a house money.\n - Don't be a MONEY HATER person. Let's say your position drop 50%, assess it. Imagine that if you have the money now, Would you get in to this position at this market price. If the answer is no, then cut the loss and exit the position. **IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH YOU PAID FOR IT** What matter is what it will be in the future.\n - Stop using fucking robinhood and use any real broker. I use Charlie's most of my trading friend use IBKR\n - Don't be fucking poor go find $25,000 and day trade if you don't have $25,000 then go live your live until you have it.\n\n\n**THE BS**\n\n - Yeah you head it before \"Scared money don't make no money\" but what if I tell you \"Stupid money also don't make no money\" So please DD before you get in any position.\n - **DIAMOND HAND** is fucking **STUPID** concept. Get that out of your system, STAT! If you think your position will loss value and you will just diamond hand through it, don't you dumb fuck. Just sell and buy back when it is cheaper!\n - NOONE fucking knows where the market will go. I repeat NOONE! So don't fucking fall for the scam.\n - TA is standing for Technical Astrology so if you need a book I recommend [this one](https://www.amazon.com/Only-Astrology-Book-Youll-Ever-ebook/dp/B00578T33K/ref=sr_1_3?crid=L0R6GAADG2J8&dchild=1&keywords=astrology+for+beginners&qid=1586368924&sprefix=astrology+for+beg%2Caps%2C194&sr=8-3).\n - What goes up might not come down. What went down might not come up. YES I AM TALKING TO YOU JNUGGER!\n\n**FAQ**\n\nDo you use stop loss and profit exit?\n\n - Yes, Stop at 7% and exit at 5% but most of the time I exit or cut loss before it hits. Except for the position I open at EOD.\n\nWhat indicator do you use?\n\n - Macro economic news and trade from experience (ie just wing it). I DON'T USE TA. Just RSI and Volume.\n\nWho the fuck use bing?\n\n - I do because it is free money [BING REWARD MOTHERFUCKER!](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/rewards?rtc=1)\n\nIt easy for you coz you have the money.\n\n - I immigrated to the US when I was 15 with $100 my uncle gave me. Did not go to highschool and busing tables when I was 17. So everyone starts somewhere.\n\nWhat is your next move?\n\n - Doggy style on your mom. Do you own fucking DD.\n\nCan I pay you to guide/mentor me?\n\n - Holy fuck no! I will create a trading group though, $1500/mo and will name it \"FALSE TRADING GROUP\".\n\nWhat should I do with this xxxx positions?\n\n - Shove it up your ass.\n\nBan and Fuck you!\n\n - Hey, Fuck you too.\n\nGood fucking luck and Happy Gambling\n\nps. make all the $60k joke I lost last year all you want but for all 14 years I only have 3 negative years which are the first two and last year.", "created_utc": 1586376222.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxdovm/wanna_make_some_money_read_this/", "is_self": true}
