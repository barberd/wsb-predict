PCG will now fully exit bankruptcy 7/1, and the optional 400m shares will be acquired by the underwriters promptly.\n\nAfter the exit, funds and other excluded investors who couldn't buy while in bankruptcy will come in.\n\nExpect this to moon now that the entrenched backstop party has no more incentive to suppress prices.\n\nThe volume has been astronomical the past 2 days, the short squeeze will be ridiculous.", "created_utc": 1593083360.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hfk8j7/pcg_offering_1080_much_higher_than_expected/", "is_self": true}
