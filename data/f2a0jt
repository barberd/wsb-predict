I\u2019ve been exploring this sub for a little while, but was hoping for some clarification on how to get started. \n\nI\u2019ve had an E*TRADE account for two years where I\u2019m invested in a few mutual funds but that\u2019s about it.\n\nHow is Robin Hood different from E*TRADE?  Is it better? Is it more worthwhile to manage funds short term or long? I thought short term ones had high fees. What\u2019s the best way to go about doing research on the fund before investing? What are some key things to look for? Help a gal out \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29\n\nAlso I studied engineering not finance so baby terms pls :))", "created_utc": 1581435539, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f2a0jt/can_someone_very_simply_explain_to_me_what_calls/", "is_self": true}
