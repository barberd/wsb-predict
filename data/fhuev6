I may be fudging the numbers a bit but $60 (or 70) puts are going for $6 at the moment with an expiration of 2-3 more weeks. That's another 25% drop, and from $150 (it's high) that would be roughly a 65% decrease. So including the premium, you need this stock to drop another 30% in 2 weeks to BREAK EVEN, which in my mind is absurd.\n\nNow I realize that goes against the thesis of WSB, but is anyone else buying ITM puts or am I thinking about this incorrectly?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Underlying Ticker is DIS", "created_utc": 1584075669.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhuev6/its_better_to_buy_itm_options_than_otm_at_the/", "is_self": true}
