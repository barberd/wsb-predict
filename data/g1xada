Millions of units of them, even with the high demand in the market which means their employees are still going to work and manufacturing and keeping up with demand hasn't been a problem, and their brands are usually the number 1 go-to brand in most countries. \n\nThey've been getting upgraded to near $150 and earnings on 4/22. Most likely dropping outlook like everyone else, but sales would surge.
