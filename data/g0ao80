{"id": "g0ao80", "title": "Johnson and Johnson Earnings Play", "selftext": "**Tl;DR: JNJ Calls 4/17**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith earnings on Tuesday, Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) probably will have the best reports of the week.  According to their latest Business Continuity Statement (3/27), they are not dealing with \"significant\" shortages in either Pharma or MedTech, and in fact dealing with **increased consumer demand**. On March 19th, JNJ saw Tylenol demand rise **two to four times normal levels** according to Kathleen Widmer, their group chairman for North America of Johnson & Johnson Consumer Health. They have had so much demand that they are facing shortages in certain parts of the country; they literally can't keep up with market demand. On top of that, JNJ is developing a CoVid-19 vaccine candidate that is set to begin Phase 1 clinical trials in September.\n\nThey are still down 2% since the initial beer-flu correction, and they capped off a 3% rally EOD Thursday with a weekly high of $144 before correcting to its current price at $141.75. Given that COVID-19 damage didn't really pick up until mid-quarter for most U.S.-based companies, their earnings aren't expected to be hit as hard as other sectors have been. [Daily, Weekly, and Monthly TA](https://www.investing.com/equities/johnson-johnson-technical) indicators have all indicated either Buy or Strong Buy.\n\nAssuming we have a small red day to pull back from last week on open, it might make sense to load up on calls before earnings.\n\nPositions: 4/17 140c, 5/15 145c\n\nNot Financial Advise, do your own research.", "created_utc": 1586747332.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0ao80/johnson_and_johnson_earnings_play/", "is_self": true}
