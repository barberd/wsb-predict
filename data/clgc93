Lately I've been reading and want to get a roth ira going, I opened one through Schwab and plan on contributing to that monthly. My question is should I transfer my Robinhood AMD shares over and go full into schwab or should I use a mix and keep buying my AMD shares monthly on Robinhood and also contributing to my ira monthly through schwab?", "created_utc": 1564819380, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/clgc93/alright_rinvesting_isnt_helping_at_fucking_all/", "is_self": true}
