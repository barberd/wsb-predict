The picture it paints is one of massive deflationary pressure that will occur as boomers grow old and sell their assets and why that deflationary pressure (ie millennials finally being able to afford houses and stuff, etc.) is bad. \n\nThe reason it's bad is because we (millennials) are expected to take care of these old assholes and if there is deflationary pressure then it will obviously mean that boomers won't be able to cash out and live the easy life. \n\nWhy it's not fair and not good, and also unamerican. American's are uniquely concerned with fairness. IE you have your time under the sun to make a difference and have impact and once that time is over you just get to hopefully reap what you have sown. \n\nThis is an amazing time because there is population contraction especially amongst the intelligent sector. Intelligent people really haven't been reproducing and the effect on the economy is a vast shortage of intelligent workers: see the massive shortage of skilled programmers in the job market...\n\nNow on to positions:\n\nInvesting in hard assets is really where you want to be for the next foreseeable future. I'm running a virtual etf of cryptocurrencies because at this point the powers that be have indicated that no they are not going to fuck with technology and as a result the obvious play is to invest in hard tech currency, ie crypto. Physical gold is also good. I would not fuck with paper gold. It's completely manipulated worse than USO. Look you watch the volume chart on USO and see that it didn't move in price?? Really? I'm sorry but only a fool would continue to invest in these traditional financial assets when such obvious manipulation is occuring.\n\npositions BTC \u221ec ETH \u221ec OXT \u221ec, XLM \u221ec, EOS \u221ec", "created_utc": 1588708312.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ge4qga/naked_money_and_why_this_panic_is_really_about_a/", "is_self": true}
