There's a lot of really smart folks on here that hide behind feigned autism - frankly you're all probably smarter than I am. That's why I'd appreciate your input/enjoy the read.  \n\n$EE *El Paso Electric* provides generation, transmission and distribution services to 400,000+ retail and wholesale customers throughout New Mexico and West Texas. It also owns a 15.8% stake in the Palo Verde Nuclear Plant.  \n\nOn June 1, 2019, IIF Infrastructure Investments Fund entered an agreement to purchase $EE at $68.25 per share or [$4.3 billion](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-el-paso-electric-m-a-infrastructure-i/el-paso-electric-to-be-bought-by-an-infrastructure-fund-for-2-78-billion-idUSKCN1T41K8). At the time, $EE was trading at $57 with $3.8 billion in assets. Obviously, it jumped to $68.25 where it has mostly remained... *(Although oddly enough it touched $63 during the March crash and an incredible amount of shares changed hands - More than when the takeover was originally announced)*\n\nIIF would have 1 year to clear array of regulatory hurdles to complete the purchase. May be extended up to 9/1 with conditions ([See agreement](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/31978/000114036119010234/form8k.htm)).\n\n[Then-CEO of El Paso Electric Mary Kipp](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/31978/000114036119010234/ex99_3.htm) sent a [letter to employees](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/56011934): \"IIF is a private investment vehicle advised by a dedicated infrastructure investment group within J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc.\" Mary goes on to note that 'IIF is a fund responsible for investing and growing the retirement funds of more than 40 million families, including 2 million families across Texas and New Mexico'. $EE would be joining IIFs family of 19 companies, including companies in NA, Europe and Australia, 11 of which were utilities as well. Mary Kipp then resigned from the company by July 1, 2019, leaving millions on the table. *Hmm...*\n\nThe consumer advocacy group *Public Citizen* quickly took issue then with the apparent upstream ownership, filing interference by 8/13 and then this complaint in [September](https://elibrary.ferc.gov/idmws/file_list.asp?document_id=14800629) 2019. Public Citizen linked IIF to JPMorgan and [it was denied vehemently](https://prospect.org/environment/jpmorgan-concedes-trying-to-buy-an-electric-utility/). In fact, all the companies in the 'family' of IIF are linked to the same 3 individuals \\[PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE PER FOLLOWING LINKS\\] Rita J. Sallis, Christopher Ward and Dennis Clarke: [https://elibrary.ferc.gov/idmws/file\\_list.asp?document\\_id=14802626](https://elibrary.ferc.gov/idmws/file_list.asp?document_id=14802626);   [https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/56011934](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/56011934). Also, in addition to being managed by those same 3 - the business addresses for all IIF funds link back to JP Morgan Investment Bank. \n\n[These findings, along with COVID19, have strengthened Public Citizen and the senate to pressure the FERC into a rehearing](https://elibrary.ferc.gov/idmws/file_list.asp?document_id=14859120)\\- likely pushing the deal beyond the 6/1 deadline. When Public Citizen reveals the deliberate attempt to conceal affiliations, armed with senators in an election year, this deal could be trashed. Public Citizen may also reveal that this has been going on for a while.
