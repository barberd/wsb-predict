Closing price for the stock is $79.76. \n\nTalked to TD AM and they said this will exercise on Monday at Market open i.e. I will be short by no. of contacts x 100 shares at $80 = $$$\n\nThey said I need to cover this asap to close the position and they will call me to do that. \n\nNow if the stock price goes further down, I will probably make more money but if it goes up then I am screwed especially it jumps. \n\nI want to get out of this situation asap as I don\u2019t want to short on 3000 shares. (30 contacts). \n\nHow long will I have to cover this? Any advise?\n\nI guess I can just hope for stock to go down further on Monday. \n\nThanks in advance.", "created_utc": 1563578526, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cfet8t/put_option_expired_in_the_money_td_ameritrade/", "is_self": true}
