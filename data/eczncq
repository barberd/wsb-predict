Selling means reporting year gains which is taxed, but if their value is in stock, it does not get taxed.\n\nThis will continue throughout the year as Trump holds little defense in his impeachment except for the performance of the market, which he will use gradual progression of trade talks and release of tariffs to pump the market until he can lock in a re-election.\n\nTherefore, there are a lot of stocks that are still undergoing correction from events this past year. As a bull, I will discuss of my most exciting findings in the market.\n\nEA, ever since the Battlefront II pay to win debacle, has been steadily growing back its original stock price at a systemic rate. If you look at interval data it looks like my debt collection fees. People forget that EA owns a nice chunk of the media market.\n\nw.e strat this is, it's making me money. Netflix, with Disney+ threat and international numbers, has also been climbing at a systemic rate. I've been scalping ever since.\n\nTL:DR- Look for companies with massive dips this past year due to unexpected events and their correction is delicious for scalping until Trump knows he's locked in for re-election.", "created_utc": 1576790554, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eczncq/ea_bull_scalping_and_other_stocks_for_2020/", "is_self": true}
