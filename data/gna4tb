{"id": "gna4tb", "title": "WM/ADSW Garbage Puts", "selftext": "Basically trying to see if there\u2019s a play here or not, and how to find more information. \n\nFor those with ADHD: Advanced Disposal (ADSW) and Waste Management (WM) 7/17 puts? Yay or nay\n\nSo in April 2019, Waste Management agreed to buy Advanced Disposal for $33.15 cash per share. Advanced Disposal immediately popped 22% to \\~$32.5 where it has steadily held. For this deal to be completed, some anti-trust legislation must be passed, which is pretty time intensive. This was expected to be completed early in Q1 2020, but has been delayed due to Covid-19, and is not exactly a high priority during the pandemic.  Waste Management leadership said at the beginning of Q2 2020 that they expect it to be completed in Q2, but I\u2019ve struggled to find sources with any material updates since March. If the deal isn\u2019t done by July 14, 2020, there are some pretty significant repercussions.\n\nFor ADSW, the main (only?) justification for the current stock price seems to be the impending(?) acquisition. Similar solid waste disposal companies (such as Waste Management) have fallen over 20% since Covid-19 began, yet ADSW has remained steady. I\u2019d be hard pressed to believe this would be the case if the $33.15 deal wasn\u2019t in place.\n\nFor WM, the repercussions of no deal are more concrete.  To help finance the acquisition, in 2019 WM issued several series of senior notes, with a principal totaling $3.5B. If the deal isn\u2019t completed by July 14, 2020, WM is required to redeem $3B of these senior notes at 101% of the principal, plus accrued interest. Furthermore, WM will have to pay a $150M termination fee to ADSW. \n\nTL;DR: Is Waste Management 7/14 acquisition of Advanced Disposal going through? If not, pretty severe consequences.  WM 7/17 80p? ADSW 7/17 25p? (seems to be low liquidity risk for ADSW options)", "created_utc": 1589976313.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gna4tb/wmadsw_garbage_puts/", "is_self": true}
