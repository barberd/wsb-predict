Closure of the parks is inevitable and will be the main catalyst for the drop to 80. California is already closing schools, it's only a matter of days when Disneyland closes there. It will be followed by Florida sooner or later, not to mention Paris. Some moron responded to my comment a few days ago \"Do yOu ReAlLy ThInK DiSnEy wIlL cLoSe PaRkS?\" Nah bro they'll be all chilling there while we'll have over 100 deaths followed by 2000 cases, empty shelves in Costco and nationwide panic-picnic next week. Parks in Asia have slim influence on Disney's revenue because the company owns only 43% of Shanghai's resort, 47% of Hong Kong's, and 0% (!) of Tokyo's (the company gets pennies from licensing fees). BUT the resorts that are making almost 20% of entire Disney's revenue have not been closed yet, and this is your opportunity to buy puts, retard.\n\nSecond - Mulan, and Black Widow premieres. Mulan was supposed to be huge money-maker for Disney this year, with main revenue from China. Hey, guess what - almost all movie theaters in China are closed (soon the majority of the theaters in Europe and the US will follow) and I don't feel like people there will be in the mood, even a month from now, to go out with 100 other randoms to chill and watch Mulan without Mushu, locked in some tiny dickhole building. Disney DID NOT reschedule movie premiere yet - but recently No Time To Die was moved from April to November, so think about it. The number of cases in Europe and the USA at the supposed day premiere of March 27th will be almost as gigantic as the play you are reading about rn. As of today, the USA tested only around 2000 people. Yes, 2-fucking thousand ONLY. \n\nBut I'm here to give you strike price and expiration date, not to convince you about the beervirus seriousness. Remember, whether or not you believe this is just flu - market will not see it that way. So go fuck yourself and buy $90p 3/27 or if you like the risk $95p 3/20. I'm also playing $100p 3/13 but I'm utterly retarded.", "created_utc": 1583626291.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ff46fd/why_dis_puts_are_the_way/", "is_self": true}
