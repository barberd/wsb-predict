Just monkey logic.\n\nThe FOMC will keep interest rate the same while strongly signaling a cut later this year.\n\nTop to bottom on the fed policy states they value maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long term interest rates.\n\nJobs report currently is stronger than ever. GDP has been weaker but inline. The key point here is stable prices.\n\nBy cutting interest rate this week, the fed is signaling that the economy has weakness, and that this is pretty much the top. While money supply would be greater, this signaling would make the market more volatile as it chugs upward hopefully. The press conference following could inject another round of uncertainties as Powell states the reasoning and the amount of dissents. This is the opposite of stable prices. Uncertainty increases.\n\nBy keep interest rate the same, the market will see a correction of a small degree (1-2%?) in the short term. But the signaling becomes much easier and the market confidence equal or greater due to the fed saying there is still torque left, don\u2019t blow the nitro too early. Additional signaling can be saying they have the finger on the button, ready and willing. The market will dip, then slowly grow until September. Stability achieved.\n\nBy holding the interest rate, the fed will also show \u201coutstanding independence\u201d from Trump, giving confidence back to the market. The media can play away the move as an \u201cunnecessary insurance\u201d in a \u201cstrong economy\u201d.  Optics contained.\n\nSpy 301 puts 8/16.  Pitch immediately after. Then buy calls/sell puts until q3 gdp comes out or September fomc meeting.", "created_utc": 1564444843, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cjjnv5/my_take_federal_interest_rates_will_remain_the/", "is_self": true}
