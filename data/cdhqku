{"id": "cdhqku", "title": "Why bulls need to pack it up", "selftext": "My short thesis for this earnings season was this:\n\n1. General thoughts on equities are that they are overbought with lots of potential downside. See MS\u2019s \u201cdowngrading global equities,\u201d JPM\u2019s \u201cearnings season going to be brutal,\u201d etc. \n\n2. Volume has been super low recently. Big money can\u2019t exit positions without tanking the market. It\u2019s hands are tied because it needs a healthy market. \n\n3. Earning reports boost liquidity, especially to the upside on good reports. \n\n4. Therefore, big money will use this \u201clast round of good earnings\u201d before things really get ugly as a means to exit positions.  \n\n5. The result: good ERs will lead to no jump in stock price or even a dip. \n\nSo far this has held up with PEP, DAL, and now C. If this continues throughout earnings season there\u2019s no way there is upside here.
