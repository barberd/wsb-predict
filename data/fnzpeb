{"id": "fnzpeb", "title": "Thursday Initial Jobless Claims", "selftext": "I see a ton of people banking on Thursday 3/26 initial jobless claim numbers to make us hit a breaker or two down to save their autistic puts.  \n\nNow I\u2019m a big gay bear like the rest of you but please do some research. \n\nThe numbers on Thursday only include initial unemployment claims up to 3/14. As of 3/14 Trump was still denying this beer flu was even a problem.  \nTrump didn\u2019t even come out with his retarded \u201c15 day plan\u201d until 3/16. All the week before was \u201c100% contained\u201d and the bat AIDS was a hoax.  \n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until 3/16 last week that people started to massively get laid off and work from home.   \nJust look at the google trends data:   \n\n\nhttps://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=Laid%20off&geo=US\n\n\nhttps://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=Apply%20for%20unemployment\n\nThey don\u2019t go vertical until after 3/14 so these numbers Thursday are actually most likely going to be BETTER than people expect now that the hype has been built for massive numbers! \nThis combined with a likely passing of the stimmy bill will lead to a big bounce starting very soon.    \n \nIV has been crushed and probably won\u2019t come back until next week. If you have puts expiring this week and you didn\u2019t cash out already you are likely proper fucked.   \n\nNext week on Friday is probably going to be the first of the big surprising numbers to start the next leg down in this crash.   \n\nhttps://www.bls.gov/schedule/2020/03_sched.htm\n\nNumbers for unemployment will be released by BLS for all of March on April 3rd which should start to show a massive spike. But even then we really won\u2019t get the full picture for another couple weeks as the layoffs continue. The big gay pump/dead cat bounce might continue into next week depending on when the stimulus bill passes and other factors.  \n\nTLDR cash gang/short term calls, your FD puts are fucked.   \n\nSPY $180p 5/15 \n\nP.s. Zoom (ZM) is massively overbought and is nothing special. ZM puts long term once all this shit is over no one will care about zoom and it\u2019s retarded market cap.", "created_utc": 1585027880.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fnzpeb/thursday_initial_jobless_claims/", "is_self": true}
