Decided to roll over to something else but all the freaking strike prices cost more than I could afford, except SPCE. I saw quick downward movement and bought 3/13 puts for fucking 17$. You know how SPCE did rest of the day. I expected full bottoming cuz of high P/E and literally nothing justifying it's current price.\n\nSo am I like a retard or something? Do I sign up for disability benefits now? If I dont get rich I'll die. please help", "created_utc": 1582931422, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fb3chh/am_i_a_king_tard/", "is_self": true}
