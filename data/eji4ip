Priced in.", "selftext": "This is a list of likely scenarios I've compiled and am picking through to find specific companies, ETFs, and etc. to bet on. Iran has never waited too long to respond, because the regime is insecure with their   \u0642\u0636\u064a\u0628 (qadib) size.\n\n1. Boat seizures in Gulf, everyone knows they'll do it.

Cyber attack, long cyber sec., short attractive targets.  Invest in Clinton's hackerproof servers.\n3. Oil fires, they will burn like the infidels, Iran can't project conventional force worth a shit. So easy targets are near by.\n4. Keep an eye on Russkies, North Korea, and Syria.\n\nEdit:\n\n5.
