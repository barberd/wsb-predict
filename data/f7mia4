Stitch Fix is currently in an ascending channel, and has broken past both a descending resistance level at $26 and horizontal resistance at $28. The stock has a short float of 45.04%, and it is likely that most bears entered their short positions at the last time the stock was at $28. I know for a fact bears have strong hands, but I also know that I'd be shitting myself if I didn't cash out and now somehow am back where I started shorting. This fear could be compounded by 2 future catalysts: 1. this post and the wsb affect, 2. earnings coming up soon. We are close to a short squeeze, just need you fellas to do what you do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Chart for anybody who is a visual learner \\(special\\)](https://preview.redd.it/g33xd7se4ei41.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d819ce15142ef0361028814400faeeabced7f0a1)\n\nNow for the fundementals: \n\nI still don't know what this company does.   \n\n\nWhat options to buy?   \nCalls for $32 or up, depends how ballsy you are.
