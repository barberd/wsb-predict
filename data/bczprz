Their financials were still shaken up even after the economy was finally coming out of the recession.\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/12/gm-hints-at-2020-chevy-corvette-c8-to-take-on-luxury-sports-car-market.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/12/gm-hints-at-2020-chevy-corvette-c8-to-take-on-luxury-sports-car-market.html)\n\nTheir new Corvette is mid-engined, similar to their European rivals that cost almost 3 times as much. Yet according to this article, GM is set to start pricing at around  \"$62,000 \u2014 or about $5,000 more than the current C7 Stingray.\" Which is insane, given GM's last mid-engine, mass produced vehicle was the Pontiac Fiero, an shitbox compared to today's cars.\n\nNow i'm not saying load up on calls now, but it's something to look into come early 2020 when GM plans to unveil the new Corvette.
