Remember how hard their stock jumped just on news of reopening their factory in Washington? The fact of the matter is that despite BA's poor performance, they are nearly a monopoly in the world of combat aircraft. We will still continue to see orders like this, and that marks a positive sentiment for BA.\n\nI had already purchased BA 7/17 300C on Friday. I hope this news causes a decent uptick on Monday. I think in the current situation, at least until we see whether COVID returns with a vengeance when we attempt to reopen, that BA can only really go up at the time being.", "created_utc": 1587318464.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g4bxpy/boeing_ba_receives_order_for_45_fighter_jets_from/", "is_self": true}
