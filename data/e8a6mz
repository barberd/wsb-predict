It\u2019s a truly Autistic legend.\n\nVincent Kosuga was a commodity yolo\u2019er of the onion market, so in-the-red and over-leveraged he could use the Autism to influence the Onion future\u2019s market to create tendies...\n\nHe had such a savant obsession of the onion market that he accounted for 20% of all trades and could even keep the brokers he traded through in brand new Buicks. \n\nThe Autism is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be... completely fucking useless. He became so Autistic... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his **DUMMY THICC ONION TENDIES**, which eventually, of course, he did. F. \n\nUnfortunately, the boys at the SEC took a break from finger poppin\u2019 each other\u2019s assholes to rain on this guy\u2019s boner. It\u2019s ironic that the legend who made sweet, sweet **fuck** to the onion futures market is the very reason trading onion futures was (and still is, IIRC) banned. \n\n\n\nAh yes, one of our forefathers... spreading some info tendies on this legend after seeing the meme. \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Kosuga\n\n\n\nPs. Darf stands for Dumb-Ass Retarded Faggot.
