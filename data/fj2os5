{"id": "fj2os5", "title": "SBUX DD", "selftext": "Ok so word just went out to all gay SBUX managers last night. Here\u2019s some insider info, make of it what you will.\n\nStores are staying OPEN.\nAs of tomorrow, every store in North America will enact the following changes:\n\nAll lobbies will have chairs and tables closed down.\nNo customer is to remain in the store after receiving their order. \nRingers will be forced to wear gloves and prevented from grabbing any orders for customers themselves. (This will slow down throughout of order fulfillment.)\nPeople will not be allowed access to a condiment bar to add creams or sugars to their drinks, all of that must be handled by the baristas prior to the customers touching the cups.\nOther gay shit.\n\nMake of this what you will. IMO slightly bearish but not super \ud83c\udf08 \ud83d\udc3b.\n\nAlright, I gotta get back to watching my girl get fucked by her stallion.\n\nTLDR: If you want SBUX puts make them for at least a few weeks out, they will continue contributing to the virus spread for a little bit longer.", "created_utc": 1584284911.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fj2os5/sbux_dd/", "is_self": true}
