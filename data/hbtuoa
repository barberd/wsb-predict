{"id": "hbtuoa", "title": "I have finally cracked the code!", "selftext": "For years, people have told me to buy low sell high. The problem with that is, you have to pick two points. One low and one high. Too much work! Also what if the high comes before the low? Are you supposed to get a time machine after you buy low and then go back in time and sell high? Makes zero sense to me.\n\nThat is, until I figured what no one else has seen. Here is the main insight, so listen carefully. In every trading day, there is one point that will be the low of the day. All you have to do is buy at or near this point. Ignore the high point for now. The trick is, you buy at the lowest point and sell at closing time. Closing time is fixed, so you only have to pick one point rather than two. You have just DOUBLED your chances of success, since you have to pick half as many points.\n\nThe odds of the low point also being the closing time is so tiny, and even then you just break even.\n\nYou literally can't lose. I am gonna start doing this tomorrow. Wish me luck", "created_utc": 1592539955.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hbtuoa/i_have_finally_cracked_the_code/", "is_self": true}
