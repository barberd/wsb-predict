{"id": "hctm4n", "title": "GAY BEAR SPORTS PLAYS", "selftext": "I tried to post this on /options, but I guess they're too good for newbies. Let's hear what you autists think:\n\nThe NBA, NFL, MLB, and NHL have yet to start (or finish) their 2020 seasons, but it seems like every day there is more news about a teams' athletes contracting COVID-19. I want to see sports happen in 2020 just as much as the next guy, but I really don't see how it is possible without putting players at risk, it being a huge inconvenience for everyone involved, and so much uncertainty of games happening on schedule each week. So that begs the question, if sports get tabled for a year... what are your favorite put plays?\n\nThe first that comes to mind is $DIS. They own 80% of ESPN, which accounted for $11bn in revenues in 2019, or roughly 16% of total revenues. Un-sports related, cases in FL are skyrocketing, so I imagine they'll have to re-close the FL parks/resorts soon, and follow suit in other places if people stop being careful (news flash: they are). The only reason I'm hesitant to short the mouse is Disney+. They're doing really, really well with almost 29 million subscribers as of Feb 2020. Is it possible sports and parks drag down, but Disney+ offsets losses? I'm still on the fence, but I'm thinking Oct Puts \\~$105. \\[Note: I believe in the mouse long-term. Entertainment and media lineup is by far best in the world, imo.\\]\n\nThe second is $DKNG. I also believe in this company long term. I've used their app and it's really well done. Great UX. Plus, they're getting ready to expand their sports betting platform (in states that allow it) and air live sports inside the app, making it an all in one betting/watching platform. But, no major sports = significantly less revenues. Can it maintain the same valuation, which is already high relative to earnings, for a year without major sports? I'm thinking Nov Puts \\~$40.\n\nThird one is Aramark. They're the biggest supplier of food and service solutions to sports stadiums and live events. They also serve big conferences, schools, universities, and convention centers. Hard to make profits if these types of events aren't allowed to happen. I'm thinking Dec Puts \\~$20.\n\nThoughts? Give me a good reason to go back in my gay bear cave and hibernate.", "created_utc": 1592686531.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hctm4n/gay_bear_sports_plays/", "is_self": true}
