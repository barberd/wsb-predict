A potential remedy for this was some blahblah alphabet soup bullshit that had at its core a plan to increase Unemployment Insurance to near 100% of what the weekly take home was (up from 45% currently). In NY State, for instance, the maximum take home is $504 a week. Assuming the 100% UI increase we are looking at a $1,120/*week* number. For up to 50% of the American public. This $1,200 one-time-deal is a fucking joke. You\u2019re basically making up the UI difference for 2 weeks. So what\u2019s the fucking plan for the next 2 weeks and the following when more than half of America has 0 savings. And all you idiots have less than that with your goddamn margin calls.  \n\ntldr: 4/3 $200 P, get fucked", "created_utc": 1585196222.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fp5266/why_the_current_stimulus_plan_is_a_jokeaccording/", "is_self": true}
