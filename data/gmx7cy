{"id": "gmx7cy", "title": "VXX price vs. theoretical underlying value to predict future VIX moves", "selftext": "I have analyzed VXX's price against its underlying futures contracts from 2018 to today scrapping CBOE data. Also, I have measured the historical difference between its theoretical value (contango rolling costs adjusted) and the close price of VXX ETN. Then, I took the simple moving average over the last 50 close (ma50) to measure by how much the mispricing deviated from the historical mean (close/ma50 - 1) each day. Today, this quantity went above 0.5. This is what happened to VXX's price in the following 5 days in terms of returns, every time this event happened since 2018-01-01.\n\nBasically, I see it like demand for VXX has been high. It has been high enough so that its price has started to mismatch the value of the products it is supposed to track, by a lot. When a big jump in this mismatch happens compared to the historical average, VXX tends to drop in the following week. The market as a whole, considering the magnitude of the corrections observed, tends to surge (I don\u2019t see a market staying flat with a 10% drop in VXX). I\u2019m positioning in consequence but anything can happen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nx27j8z1bsz41.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=86c7013440c6fac2fe1abd196825780f4c7a2b15\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fz6r7wgxcsz41.png?width=833&format=png&auto=webp&s=96756529b7480850cfc7b99febc85a354ba62506", "created_utc": 1589922083.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gmx7cy/vxx_price_vs_theoretical_underlying_value_to/", "is_self": true}
