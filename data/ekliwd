It\u2019s been like 11 years on a bull run and you\u2019ve lost how much money being wrong that whole entire time. Now based off of some bad news (ya know, more crusading and such), the market is going to be red for like a week and you guys will be on here SUCKING EACH OTHER OFF about how right you were this whole time. There\u2019s going to be some weird homoerotic shit between bears on this sub until a week from Monday when the market opens green and goes to the moon while your SPY puts put you on welfare. Now don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not homophobic because I kiss my uncle on the mouth but I\u2019m just calling it like I see it. You\u2019ll be right ONE time out of like a few thousand and think you\u2019re Warren Buffett\u2019s special-ed little brother.", "created_utc": 1578269416, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ekliwd/eat_my_hairy_white_ass_bears/", "is_self": true}
