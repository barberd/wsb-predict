Idk what that is but all I know is I can\u2019t wait to dump money into ACB and have ACB price pump up after announcement.\n\n\n(Who am I kidding can\u2019t wait to lose money on my calls - got 10 3/20 at a strike of 2)", "created_utc": 1577828768, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ei9ca5/acb_priced_in/", "is_self": true}
