I've worked retail in one of the larger chains, and i can tell you whats going on in the field.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAmongst pharmacists, there are tiers to each top chain pharmacies that we sorta  agree upon. Ofc the higher tier meaning the shittier work place and higher stress level. When we talk to people who understand what pharmacists go thru, we give each other a pat on the back when we say Im from chain X and chain Y. Rite Aid is never among them, cuz they a fking joke. no offense, other Rite Aid pharmacists.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyhow, rite aid lost their exclusivity to some express scripts plan to my knowledge, and been closing stores left and right. Unlike other retail sectors, you need physical locations to increase revenue for a pharmacy. This all points to how little business they are and will get. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother DD is that if you ever walked in walgreens or cvs, youd feel like youre stuck in early 00s. Rite aid has brand spanking new flooring and fixtures for a lot of there stores. unnecessary costs if you ask me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRite Aid is dead folks. pharmacist jobs are becoming scare and life sucks for me, but i can at least make some change off a dying pharmacy.", "created_utc": 1569293874, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d8h9xk/rite_aid_dd_from_a_professional_v2/", "is_self": true}
