Even if bear signs appeared, Mango would not allow a slip prior to November. Mango will do anything and everything imaginable to keep the economy and stock market from slipping. Therefore, the market euphoria will continue and most certainly the trend of one stock suddenly rising will continue. First, it was Tillray despite not even having any financials to hold it up. Then, Beyond Meat. Then Tesla went on the biggest euphoria run of all. Which stock is next? SPCE is the best stock with the potential to attract mass-market euphoria. SPCE could explode to $70 in the next 5 months.\n\nWhat single stock other than SPCE that is better positioned to attract enormous euphoric investment? SPCE is the perfect company where autists will see a shiny new idea, new market and new amazing innovation and jump in. This will result in a major stock rise.\n\nTLDR: I'm thinking of buying $40 calls expiring around May/June", "created_utc": 1581562624, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f336ct/spce_likely_to_be_the_next_tillraybyndtesla/", "is_self": true}
