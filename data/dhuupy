Expect massive volatility on their report, especially if it is negative. Expect heavy sad autism tomorrow from (intellectual) people losing tons of money. Do not pass go. Do not buy spy options. Do not collect $200. Watch Bank of America also this week, they are an extremely large bank and they have just as much market power as JPM. Look for guidance on all banks. Many market crashes in history have happened in October as large financial institutions report terrible spooky numbers. Do not falter. Do not fall into the trap that is October financial earnings. Stay safe out there WSB. Cuz this trains heading for a cliff and I\u2019m not sure if they built the wings for it yet. It\u2019s important you also take a look at how much money the banks are hoarding. It will allow you to determine how conservative or liberal they are being with their cash. Good luck all!", "created_utc": 1571078085, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dhuupy/red_alert_jpm_reports_earnings_tomorrow_morning/", "is_self": true}
