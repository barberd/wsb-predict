This is the kind of stuff that brings the derelicts.  I'm also a bit disappointed with #7 - but I understand and I'm sympathetic.  We'll work on that later...but in the meantime, charge your fucking batteries you derelicts.  We can't rebuild the world with you staring at your RH portfolio until it goes into low power mode.  Focus.\n\nThis quarter - lets see if we can increase production on yolo's.  CNBC should not be above yolo's...smh.  Sorry gay bears, I think Gerald (#8) has to retire from the list (**meme request:** please use [this scene](https://youtu.be/KhatWgDgBKQ?t=39) to send Gerald off).  Need to clear a spot for #23 (bullish Becky) to return to the top 10 list.  (**Meme request** for #23: [Becky](https://youtu.be/UbumyLslqDc?t=99)...taking bucket from Gerald...asking Gerald if he enjoyed his time on the list.  Sending him off.  Becky flying to the moon with Geralds bucket.  Add a clever narrative to go with it.  Go.  I know I won't be disappointed with the talent we have here)\n\nFor our fallen brother [u/hasbs](https://www.reddit.com/user/hasbs/)...  I want to see Questrade on the top 100.  Those dirty fuckers.  Let's see if we can swap #90 \"bamboozled\" with \"Questrade\".\n\nWe need to replace #41 \"yacht\" with any of the following: RCL,CCL or NCLH.  Why settle for a yacht when you can buy a cruise ship at their yard sale.  Don't be stupid - sterilize that shit before you party in it.\n\nI'll end with this...\n\nFor those of you who are sitting on some cash right now and don't want to get into the market - in another month or two, start looking for deals on used vehicles.  People without jobs are going to be selling their shit because they never learned how to save money.  They're going to liquidate for food/rent/utility money.  Their loss is your gain.
