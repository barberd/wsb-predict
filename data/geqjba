You're currently wondering why I didn't post put prices..but isn't it obvious? Stonks only go up.  \n\\- **PhDD on CZR -**\n\n1. Las Vegas Mayor, Carolyn Goodman, is itching to open the local economy up. She actually offered up her citizens as a 'control group'. [Proof in this video](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/04/23/las-vegas-mayor-coronavirus/).\n2. CZR hit a 52 week high of 14.73 just days before the ChynaVirus meltdown.\n3. CZR currently has 70,000,000 outstanding shorted shares with an average of 3.2 days to close. These 70 million short shares makes up approximately 450% of daily average trade volume.\n4. Institutional Owners makes up more than 55% of CZR investors.\n5. Ichan, Vanguard, and BlackRock all hold significant shares.\n6. Anal Ratings: Moderate Buy with 3 Strong Buys & 4 Hold. 0 Sell ratings.\n7. Next Earnings is 5/11/2020 which means IV shall increase.\n8. Implied Volatility Percentile is a mere 17%! Pretty low. Pretty Exciting.\n9. Merger. CZR to merge with El Dorado in June. CZR to receive $8.40 per share. Both Management teams say all systems are go on the merger.\n10. Having ten bullet points is psychologically significant. Perhaps when CZR gets over $10 it'll make use of that same psychology.\n\n**- BULLshit on CZR -**\n\nWhat's always a cheap vacation that always accessible to morons? Hint, they also go here to relax and win money: ~~WallStreetBets~~ Las Vegas! Now with a free $1,200 TrumpBux to kickstart the losing.\n\nCasinos will be aggressive in opening back up. The scientist turned Vegas mayor and mob and stuff will see to that...right?\n\nMotley Fool and shitty websites have started covering the merger and the bounce off the RonaVirus lows of $3.30. They've been plastering click bait articles with headlines like: [CZR Stock up 42.9% in April](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/05/why-caesars-entertainment-stock-popped-429-in-apri.aspx). There are about a half dozen websites running this **exact** same article. What does this mean? It means somebody somewhere knows something...\n\n\"but the 52 week ATH is only approx $15, a $15 call won't print\" blah blah blah  \nYou never know, it might go higher than $15 from new, or a short squeeze. Plus, you only need czr to go from $9.40 to $11 and your $15c is 2 or 3x or something. How neat is that? That's pretty neat.\n\nAs J.Powell's money printers continues, stonks will go up. Pick ones with cheap options, the probability of good news, and stuff. Investors? Could be you!!!\n\nLastly, I found [this](https://imgur.com/a/ApiEPNN).  \nIs it a sign? Yes, it is quite literally, a sign.\n\nHappy Hunting Mongoloids.  \nCZR 6/19c $11  \nCZR 9/18c $15\n\nTL;DR: Buy CZR calls because of all the words above.", "created_utc": 1588792792.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/geqjba/caesar_calls_here_get_your_cheap_young_czr_calls/", "is_self": true}
