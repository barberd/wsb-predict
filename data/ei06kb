{"id": "ei06kb", "title": "Self-perceived realized gains difficulty levels and trading goals for 2020", "selftext": "Hey guys, we're all here to make money, so let's set some realistic goals and ranges for next year. \n\nSetting and achieving goals are important. I figured I would set up my own self-perceived difficulty levels for realized gains amounts in 2020 to see if I can push the limit higher and challenge myself. You guys should set up your own limits. Just be honest and realistic with the amounts.\n\nObviously this is going to be different for those with higher or lower portfolio sizes. My extreme difficulty might be someone else's very easy difficult or vice versa. We all have to start somewhere. \n\nSo here are the difficulty tiers that I set up for myself. Hopefully in a year I will look back at this and be proud. Kind of like a self-fulling prophecy. \n\nNegative, or 0: Failing. **Unacceptable.** Trading may not be for me if this happens. Will have to reevaluate game plan early on if things are not going in the right direction. \n\n36-48k/yr, 3-4k/mo: **very easy difficulty.** C- to C grade (1.7-2.29 GPA). Not very stimulating, not enough to live off of and nothing to really talk about. Barely passing. Can probably get away with opening a few trades a week and only managing if necessary. Could be done with mobile trades only.\n\n48-60k/yr, 4-5k/mo: **easy difficulty.** C to C+ grade (2.30-2.69 GPA). Mostly easy with some challenges along the way. Could be done with mobile trades only, but trading at the desk would be better. Likely won't need to trade more than a couple hours each week.\n\n72-96k/yr, 6-8k/mo: **medium to hard difficulty.** Challenging. B- to B+ grade (2.70-3.49 GPA). Great work ethic required. Might not need to wake up at 6:30am each day unless there is a position that goes against me overnight that should be closed at open. Would need to trade at least three days a week including Friday. Trading futures may help reach this goal, but is not required. \n\n100-144k/yr, 8.3-12k/mo: **hard to very hard difficulty.** Very challenging. Definitely an A- to A student at this level (3.5-3.99 GPA). A comfortable amount to make and be proud of. Will require a strong work ethic similar to 2019, but with managing risk better. Must be willing to close positions going against me before things get out of hand. Must trade at a desk. May need to trade everyday, or have one day off. May need to trade futures. Not many mistakes can be made. This is my goal target. More would be nicer, but this is something that I know I can work towards if I put in the effort. May reduce difficulty level if I am averaging to this amount.\n\n180-240k/yr, 15-20k/mo: **extreme difficulty.** May not even be possible for me to reach this year. Would require small to no mistakes. A+ (4.00 GPA) with extra curricular activities. Mental health will take a toll, and the extra money made may not be worth it for my own well being. Highest work ethic and drive required. Melatonin required to sleep early and wake up at 4-5am PT each day, and caffeine to be alert throughout. Trading futures most likely required. A combination of scalping and swing trading. This range is the dollar amount at which I will stop trading and will reduce difficulty to cruise the rest of the year. Might not come close to this amount this year, but it's nice to have something to aim for. Maybe in a few years it will be my medium to hard difficulty.\n\nGood luck to everyone in 2020!", "created_utc": 1577780719, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ei06kb/selfperceived_realized_gains_difficulty_levels/", "is_self": true}
