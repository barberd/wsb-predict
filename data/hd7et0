{"id": "hd7et0", "title": "MGM NHL Play", "selftext": "The NHL is gonna have 2 hub cities for their playoffs and Vegas is almost definitely one of them. So you\u2019ll have 12 NHL teams in one city so they\u2019ll need hotels and guess who\u2019s the official resort and hotel sponsor of the NHL? That\u2019s right MGM. And MGM owns hotels right next to T-Mobile Arena, where they\u2019ll be playing so it makes sense that the NHL will stay in these hotels to keep everything as compact as possible. The NHL is gonna announce officially the hub cities in the coming week so \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nPositions:\nMGM 18.5C 7/2", "created_utc": 1592748113.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hd7et0/mgm_nhl_play/", "is_self": true}
