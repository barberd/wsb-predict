As a sector, solar's growth has been absolutely insane (just look at how the IEA has [underestimated](https://www.vox.com/2015/10/12/9510879/iea-underestimate-renewables) it every single year for the past decade), and it's only going to keep skyrocketing as governments launch economic stimulus packages in the hundreds of billions ([\u20ac750 billion already on deck for the EU](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-budget-recovery-climate-factbox/factbox-key-climate-spending-in-eus-green-recovery-plan-idUSKBN2331RB), which has the world's most ambitious climate targets, plus individual European countries on their own / eventually the [Green New Deal in the US](https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2020/06/24/houses-1-5-trillion-infrastructure-bill-packed-with-pro-solar-pro-storage-provisions/) when Green becomes the new Orange). \n\nSunpower is [set to spin off Maxeon](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sunpowers-planned-maxeon-solar-technologies-spin-off-receives-key-regulatory-approval-301060041.html), which will produce its solar PV panels (the Chinese fund TZS is taking a 30% stake for $300 million - valuing Maxeon at $1 Billion - and SPWR will own the remaining 70%) and then Sunpower will operate as a stand-alone residential and commercial solar energy services company (i.e., like Sunrun). The point is to allow the market to more accurately value both parts of the company: the current market cap is like $1.3 billion, whereas Maxeon is going to be valued at $1 billion alone at the moment of spinoff\n\n**The squeeze**: There are more shares sold short than available shares that trade on the market. Far more. Here's why: **SPWR has 170 million shares.** Total (the oil giant) owns **90 million shares** of SPWR (because they know oil is fucked and that solar is the future). [Nasdaq shows](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/spwr/institutional-holdings) that other institutional holders (ETFs like TAN and mutual funds, etc) own 41.5% of the outstanding stock, or **70.5 million shares**. \n\nSo far we are at 90 million + 70.5 million = 160.5 million. 170 million - 160.5 million = 9.5 million. Ok? \n\nBut the short interest currently stands at 12%. **That means that there are 20.5 million shares sold short, but the total available float of shares is just 9.5 million.** How is this possible? Because brokers loan out shares to short sellers, so effectively they are in use twice. Once as a long position in someone's account, and simultaneously as a short position in a different account. \n\nTotal sure as shit is not selling its 90 million. And most of the institutions holding big positions are not trading shops and hedge funds, they are holding as a part of ETF indices or mutual funds, so they aren't just going to sell their shares either. \n\nWhen SPWR starts seriously progressing upwards, the shorts are going to be hella, hella fucked, because there aren't enough shares **at all** for them to all cover their positions. \n\n**TL;DR - 8/21 $9 calls (if you want the highest volume) or 1/21 $10, $12, or $15 (there's high open interest so volume will pick up)**", "created_utc": 1593674261.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hjsgek/spwr_set_up_for_a_massive_massive_short_squeeze/", "is_self": true}
