(OHI)", "selftext": "  \n\n\n**\"Omega Healthcare Investors** is a triple-net, equity REIT (NYSE: OHI) that supports the goals of Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) and Assisted Living Facility (ALF) operators with financing and capital.\"   \n\n\nOHI is primarily invested in nursing facilities.    Nursing facilities are hemorrhaging right now.   These facilities make a lot of money from short term rehab stays as well as long term residents.   Things like post operative care for knee and hip surgeries,  strokes, cardiac after care..etc.   Elective procedures aren't happening right now, and if folks can help it,  they are discharging home.   \n\n\nMedicare has also shifted payments in the SNF sector,  resulting in a potential loss is revenue.  Some of the other larger health care REITS have gotten off the nursing home train,  whereas OHI is going yolo.   \n\n\nNursing facilities in particular are a huge risk for covid-19 and are being hit hard.    Long term residents that die aren't getting replaced,  short term stays are way down.   Nursing facilities are absolutely losing money. \n\nOHI 52 week high is   $45,  the low is $13.   It is currently trading around $33.   \n\n\nThey are going to get wrecked in the next few months.     The obvious sticking point is volume.    But who cares.. shut up at buy puts,  or wait for the impending crash and buy some stocks.   \n\n\nTL;DR  \n\n\nOHI  puts 1+ month out.", "created_utc": 1586792701.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0lfnv/omega_healthcare_investors_inc_ohi/", "is_self": true}
