A shoeshine boy had no fucking business being in the market, it really wasnt easily accessible to the poors. \n\nToday, everyone owns a mobile device. You have many different options for brokers, and almost all of them are commission free. It is as easy as deciding \"I want to buy stonks, right now.\" For anyone over the age of 18 with a bank account. \n\nWhat I'm saying is that yeah, your uber driver might be talking to you about stocks. Your barista might mention stocks. The chick at footlocker might be killing it in forex. Because it has NEVER been this easy or accessible for ordinary people to be involved in the market. In 1929, 10% of households owned stocks. Today, it is over 50%. \n\nTl;dr: JFKs dad is dead get over it.
