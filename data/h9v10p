Powell (SPY, VXX)", "selftext": "DD: Mr. Printer goes to Washington (how to play the 6/16 and 6/16 congressional finance hearings)\n\n*The Backstory and some FAX:*\n\nSo on June 10th, Jerome spoke for about an hour. Nothing to write home about as he was just largely keeping commitments to a liberal fiscal policy, keeping interest rates slashed through 2022\u2014typical \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever it takes\u201d type shit. Should\u2019ve been a giant bull flag, right?\n\nWrong. Wrong as a bear celebrating last night before going to bed.\n\nThe news largely ran headlines about his \u201cdire warnings\u201d and such\u2014I\u2019ve read the transcript, this did not happen. (If you nerds want to read it: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20200610.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20200610.pdf) ) News cycle runs through the afternoon into the evening, coupled with some lukewarm posts about a coming second wave. Everyone took one quote where he said long road ahead and ran it.\n\nWhy? I am an independent, and I am black, so I don\u2019t love DT. That said, I\u2019m a realist and like to play it fair. I think anybody on either side can acknowledge news media has a bias, and they are working overtime to ensure that Trump looks bad\u2014even at the expense of the economy, because it\u2019s his ace in the hole. They largely generate headlines to scare boomers out their positions and it works.\n\nFearmongering in media takes over Wednesday night, and Thursday 6/11 happens. SPY drops 5.7%, VIXX goes up 17%. Chicken littles, sad bulls, aroused bears--the speculative market is a zoo of speculative emotion.\n\nThen Friday 6/12 comes, we open way the fuck down before the Fed repo schedule liquidations kick in and MM go full throttle. (Fed schedule posts here, that\u2019s right junior, the PAUMP is a timed mechanism: [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/repo-reverse-repo-agreements/repurchase-agreement-operational-details](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/repo-reverse-repo-agreements/repurchase-agreement-operational-details) )\n\nWhat\u2019s the big deal about Friday? Trump speaks on race, and it is an absolute shitshow during. SPY drops 3 and a half percent to the perceived bottom, 298. Shortly after, 2 pm pump takes over and news cycle for the weekend is about the dramatic turnaround, sprinkled in with some liberal media coronavirus part 2 pump. What\u2019s crucial here is that shit was up and down right before Trump spoke\u2014PEOPLE WERE WAITING TO HEAR WHAT AUTHORITY WOULD SAY because the market was confusing and the news was negative. Then when Trump got on the tv it was all systems go on a red hour.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------\n\n*So fucking what?*\n\nWhy does this matter? There are not that many things happening at once that should directly affect our market aside from riots, corona, earnings, and bubble fears. That shit was all priced in during the Floyd riots. The only outlier is news that runs when JPow or Donnie Pump speak. It has a direct impact on the market, particularly in the moment and about a day out in a trailer affect.\n\n**We\u2019ve been gifted with concurrent Jerome speaking engagements and a confused market this week, simultaneously. Jerome speaks at 10 am tomorrow to the Senate Finance Committee**\u2014this is a GREAT litmus\u2014the Republican led senate committee will give him softball questions because they want continued brrrr. If SPY dips during this, load on the PUTS for 6/19\u20146/17 if you\u2019re feeling freak nasty. Why?\n\n**The hearing on Wednesday at NOON is with the Democratic House Financial Services Committee.** It is chaired by Maxine fucking Waters\u2014these people hate Trump with all their soul, and more importantly they are going to attack attack attack fed policy that has stocks at an all time high while us minorities are getting double cocked by Covid that kills us more easily because of preexisting conditions AND I can\u2019t breath shit.\n\nTomorrow morning, at 11 am, we will know everything we need to know about what the rest of the week will be like in the markets.\n\nIF SPY dips during, and immediately after, Jerome Speaks tomorrow\n\n**Tuesday 6/16 buy**\n\nSPY 6/17p\n\nVXX 6/19c\n\nConversely, IF the market doesn\u2019t respond much at all, on **TUESDAY buy:**\n\nVXX 6/19c u/EOD and dump on Wednesday 6/17 EOD\n\n**TLDR:** People give a lot of a shit what the media tells them to do when the market is at a tipping point like the past week, and the media gets the fodder from Jerome. If Tuesday\u2019s lightweight hearing with the fed friendly Republican senate causes a sizable downswing, even temporarily, bet the farm on VXX and SPYp because the democratic house hearing Wednesday will be a bloodbath. If Tuesday goes smooth, take advantage with a short window of VXX for Wednesday temporary drop from hearing.", "created_utc": 1592275904.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h9v10p/dd_playing_this_weeks_congressional_hearings_with/", "is_self": true}
