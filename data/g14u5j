There will be no big drop\n\nYes, the Recession is canceled. There may be drops along the way, but nothing like what people are hoping for and nothing like the massive sudden 30% drop we originally faced. In the end stocks will rise. \n\nAny factors that you think will drop the economy are priced in. If you, some retard, knows these things, the experts know it too and more! \n\nThis is not comparable to 2008 and corporate debt isn\u2019t that big a deal. Most of the retards who have been calling for a big drop don\u2019t know what the fuck they are talking about. There are no housing bubbles and shit. While I also have no idea what I\u2019m talking about, there is one big difference between me and the other retards. I am right and they are WRONG as evidence by the massive market pump.\n\nAlso, now that WSB is bullish it does NOT mean to inverse. The people buying calls are the ones inversing WSB because WSB has been saying for weeks that there will be a big drop. I am the one inversing bitch! The fact that this post is getting so much hate shows that I am still inversing WSB. Thank god I am liberated from my autistic positions inspired by gay WSB bears.\n\n I speak from a position of someone who has family who are infected with Covid-19. This too shall pass and once it does, there is not much in the way of the economy. \n\nThis is not satire, or gay bs, STOCKS ONLY GO UP. I AM DONE LISTENING TO YOU RETARDS, I AM GOING ALL IN ON SIG $8 CALLS.
