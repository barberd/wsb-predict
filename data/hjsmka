How long will they keep going up? Is this a healthy growth or is a bubble forming? Most of the cloud companies are doing just fine right now but I'm not sure if the valuations are accurate right now with all of them multiplying 2x, 3x or even 5x in a couple months time. Nothing has really changed except for the fact that people work more from home now. This will also not keep up as companies will want their employees on site more often as the 'rona fades away.", "created_utc": 1593675104.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hjsmka/is_there_a_cloud_bubble/", "is_self": true}
