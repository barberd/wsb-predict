So if trader A writes the contract they are liable for it? Even if Trader B buys it, then sells it to Trader C?\n\nThanks all!!      \n\n\n  \nEDIT:  I also understand its not really a specific contract linked to a specific trader really...", "created_utc": 1586677847.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fzsm38/selling_an_option_contract_back_to_the_market/", "is_self": true}
