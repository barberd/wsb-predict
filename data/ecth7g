{"id": "ecth7g", "title": "Big $STSN News - They just released the companies first video following the reverse merger. Their new CEO grew their last company to 65m in annual sales!", "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mentioned this last week or so. I noticed on the SEC and FINRA website, they took over the shell WMEG, and changed name with the merger to StemSation ( $STSN ) - They just released a video of their new CEO, the guy who's last company ran to 65 million in annual sales. I think their first PR is coming this week.\n\nCongrats to those in already. Float is only 1.1million. Should run nicely in couple dollar range in 2020. Check out those filings. :)\n\n[https://twitter.com/StemsationI/status/1207658823474745344?s=20](https://twitter.com/StemsationI/status/1207658823474745344?s=20)", "created_utc": 1576763614, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ecth7g/big_stsn_news_they_just_released_the_companies/", "is_self": true}
