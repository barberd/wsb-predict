{"id": "emcgqc", "title": "Pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered", "selftext": "Just a reminder to all of you sitting on 10-40% Tesla unrealized gains from the last month of trading, stonks, options, whatever. \n\nI put a stop limit at 485 today because I made 20% on putting some cash into the Tesla upswing.\n\nKnowing the company and it\u2019s history and where it\u2019s at and all that... it\u2019s been a good run. But i was happy with that and I called it good. Maybe I\u2019d miss out maybe I won\u2019t. But don\u2019t forget to have a strategy and cut your losses or strategy to take your gains.\n\nI\u2019m going to use some of that money for a new guitar I\u2019ve been putting off buying and getting my dog\u2019s teeth cleaned and bank the rest into some other stuff.\n\nJust wanted to say that your gains are nothing until you take them. Pigs get fat and hogs get slaughtered. \n\nTake your gains and use them for future gains and trades or buy yourself something nice or put it away for retirement. But try to remember to take your gains when the gains are good. Remember when enough is enough. You don\u2019t always have to time the market perfectly but you should always keep an exit strategy in mind. Maybe that\u2019s holding TSLA for 5 years or maybe it\u2019s holding it for 5 days but try to have a strategy for your trades or you\u2019ll only ever be subject to swings and movement completely out of your control.", "created_utc": 1578589278, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/emcgqc/pigs_get_fat_hogs_get_slaughtered/", "is_self": true}
