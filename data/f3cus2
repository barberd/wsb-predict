Not really sure how I can show all of my positions for this since it was probably around 50 different trades. I mainly have been selling put spreads on apple and Microsoft, apple I usually try to sell weeklies or 2 weeks out with the short leg about 10 dollars out the money. \nIt was nice being able to live thru the corona virus recession and still be making money on theta, since I would\u2019ve lost a ton of money if I were still just buying calls like I used to. These spreads are fun but you definitely need to keep looking for entry points into trades and doing DD like you would for calls. For me, if I\u2019m bullish in the short term on the stock I prefer selling the put spreads rather than buying calls even if it does limit my gains some. \nGonna be taking a break for a couple weeks after this, need some time to relax.", "created_utc": 1581612785, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3cus2/been_a_pretty_good_month_since_joining_theta_gang/", "is_self": true}
