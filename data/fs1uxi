{"id": "fs1uxi", "title": "The history of the printing press", "selftext": "[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing\\_press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press)\n\nI have some evidence that will show that Mr J Pow is guilty of using machine created not too long ago to create money.\n\nThe printing press was first created about 200 after the death of Jesus. They used woodblock printing which hasn't been priced in to be fair. Look for companies that make woodblocks and buy calls on them. $SPY.\n\nHere is where things get interesting this guy is a goldsmith so be careful. The gold man CREATED the fucking printer so gold would keep its value. evidence is right below. In the second paragraph of the wiki we can see right here. Johannes Gutenberg.\n\n\" In Germany, around 1440, goldsmith [Johannes Gutenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Gutenberg) invented the printing press\"\n\nThis breakthrough lead to the printing revolution. This may or may not be true but there is a rumor that an early version of the J pow printer was probably based off of Johannes's blue print design.\n\nOk next the Printing Revolution occurred when the printing press facilitated the wide circulation of info. Knowledge = power = money. Basically everyone and their mom started printing shit in europe during this time and it was very bad because people were now able to read. This was bad for the autists at the time because their friends could read and they were left behind to suffer. These autists are the same ones that your parents lineage came from. Nothing surprising there.\n\nAlso note jerome fucked us back in 2011 too.\n\n\"Between 2010 and 2012, Powell was a visiting scholar at the [Bipartisan Policy Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisan_Policy_Center), a [think tank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank) in Washington, D.C., where he worked on getting Congress to raise the [United States debt ceiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_debt_ceiling) during the [United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_debt-ceiling_crisis_of_2011). Powell presented the implications to the economy and interest rates of a default or a delay in raising the debt ceiling.[\\[19\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell#cite_note-bpcbio-19) He worked for a salary of $1 per year.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell#cite_note-richest-2) \"\n\nSource: Jerome Powell. (2020, March 29). Retrieved from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome\\_Powell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell)\n\nThe [debt ceiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_public_debt#Debt_ceiling) was increased by $400\u00a0billion immediately during the Budget control act of 2011\n\nIndustrial revolution came and this is where we start to get fucked. They created this disgusting abomination that printed money even faster then ever before. Autists like you and I couldn't believe how much J powell wanted to fuck our ass holes. he went from 400 billion to unlimited?\n\nJust so you know \u221e / 400 Billion = \u221e . This man wants to complete Johannes Gutenberg's mission which is to make us only use gold.\n\nFinal creation that ended the world's greatest economy.
