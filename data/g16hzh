Massive money printing will make your stock market go up but will also make your currency go down.  The Fed is going to print to infinity until we get to the other side of this coronavirus.  They will print to infinity to prop up any deflating bubble in any shitty company run by corrupt assholes who leveraged the shit out of it.  There is going to be non stop bailouts.\n\nThe US stock market measured in gold will crash.  So get out of it.  Invest in leap calls on gold mining stocks.  GOLD 30c Jan 2022.  AUY 5c Jan 2022.  Then let the Fed print to infinity.
