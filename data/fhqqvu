Otherwise I'd be up another $5-10k after it came crashing back down.  The majority of my positions got closed out.  I really can't complain. Note that these accounts don't have margin (IRAs), so I reloaded with just a handful of \"cheap\" SPY 3/27 $200p contracts right near the top of the spike, which printed for the rest of the afternoon (up 200% by EOD).  I didn't want to double down on a major position and end up stuck with a selling restriction while waiting for the funds to settle.\n\nShit is looking pretty bleak right now though so I'm debating if I should buy some more puts tomorrow and hold over the weekend, or hold off for a bit.  At some point soon I think we're gonna open Schrodinger's box and find another dead cat, but with how much is getting shut down globally, plus the mass panic that \ud83c\udf7a\ud83e\udda0 coupled with the U.S. government's shit show of a response has caused, I don't think we're anywhere close to the bottom yet.  It's become pretty obvious by now that nobody gives two shits about anything the fed does (not in a positive way, anyways) because we're all going to be burning in hell 2 months from now anyways.  \n\n\nEdit: Strikes and Dates for all you autists below\n\n* BAC 9/20 $18p (this is the only position that didn't get closed out)\n* WYNN 4/9 $90p\n* TQQQ 3/20 $65p\n* TQQQ 3/27 $60p\n* LYV 4/17 $47.5p\n* BA 4/17 $200p\n* SPY 3/27 $200p\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1584059178.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhqqvu/tendy_printer_engaged/", "is_self": true}
