{"id": "di9gnm", "title": "Buy $CCI Puts, Insider View", "selftext": "TLDR: Buy CCI puts before the 10/16 earnings call, T-Mobile is one of their biggest revenue streams and stopped leasing new towers until after the Sprint merger which is delayed. \n\nLong time degenerate first time poster, I work for a hedge fund that focuses on telecom so I follow the tower industry very closely. \n\nThe big tower companies are American Tower, Crown Castle, and SBA Communications. Crown Castle is the first to release its earnings report this quarter so the best chance to take advantage. The way these companies make money is by building cell towers and leasing space on the towers for cell equipment to the big four (AT&amp;T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Sprint). The big four need these towers because the signal goes further when it is high in the air allowing us to buy FD's from our phones but they do not build their own towers, they lease them. \n\nCrown Castle is one of the largest tower builders and T-Mobile is one of their largest clients, however, due to delays in the merger with Sprint, T-Mobile has announced that it will not be ordering any new tower builds or leasing any new space on towers until the merger is over. This means Crown Castle has effectively lost one of its biggest clients for the last quarter and the near future. This hasn't been reflected in the stock price yet so the earnings report and guidance should send this thing down 5 to 10%. \n\nAll in $CCI puts lets go!", "created_utc": 1571153159, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/di9gnm/buy_cci_puts_insider_view/", "is_self": true}
