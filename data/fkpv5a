All the IV priced in... time to watch the world burn. \n\nUntil something pretty caught my eye on the way out the door. ULTA ($ULTA). \n\nWould you believe it if I told you they have a market cap of $11B? And 1,124 stores?\n\nHow do you think retail is going to fare over the next 1-2 years? How about a place that sells shit you can find on Amazon? \n\nRetail dying is axiomatic at this point... how ULTA is still standing, at this valuation, after withdrawing guidance announcing the closure of all their stores, is beyond me. \n\nI made a $40k bet, 4/17 $125 Puts at $9. \n\nProof in top link. I believe we will see sub-$100 in next couple weeks. \n\nBest of luck everyone. And remember, stay safe, and just don\u2019t dance.\n\nEDIT:\n\nFor those of you claiming PnD, [I\u2019m still here. ](https://imgur.com/gallery/Kpz3hFF) \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udd90\ud83c\udffb fellas.", "created_utc": 1584539673.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkpv5a/dd_5k_to_330k_in_3_weeks_ulta_is_my_next_move/", "is_self": true}
