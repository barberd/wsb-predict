Well, I say *lost,* but it isn't a loss until you sell. 2/28 calls. Holding. I'm kicking the bucket on AMD. I'll cut my losses. Move on. But not without a plan. My big boy money is coming from my bank. Finally. Been waiting 5 days. It's 50 grand. This whole time I been making money, I always kicked myself. Like, I would invest a measly 1,000 and make back one and a half times it. I'd have just the same balls to throw in 50k at those same plays, and thus make y'know, one and a half times 50k. Basic mathematics, se\u00f1or. I mean, albeit I lost all my profits and then some. Butt fuck it. That was my seven thousand dollar pre-trial. Oh yeah, so about TQQQ... I'm thinking that'll do me good as AMD did me good this past Monday. I think it'll have that Monday boost, and be easy money. So I'm thinking just buy fifty thousand bucks worth of calls, and sell like a half hour later. Not too greedy. Just wanna make back what Wells Fargo stole.", "created_utc": 1582333565, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7l39n/monday_morning_green_zone_the_skys_the_limit_and/", "is_self": true}
