Warning: words, words, words, very boring, tl:dr at bottom.", "selftext": "Previous post:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gbsyfk/tea\\_leaves\\_and\\_trade\\_wars\\_good\\_for\\_a\\_free\\_15\\_just/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gbsyfk/tea_leaves_and_trade_wars_good_for_a_free_15_just/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis post is long, very long. Tl:dr at the bottom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhere have the daily posts been lately? Well, we're still well within our original parameters, and volume continues to provide choppy earnings, but generally trending our margins of expected up/down. I'm trying to put up posts a couple/few days at a time, unless there is something specifically that needs to be discussed that affects the prediction model. If its a 'nothing special' day, I likely won't be posting. Worth noting, volume continues to be low after getting roused over the weekend, likely a result of Trumps remarks about retaliating against China. The \"ups\" were at 75-85m before that, and the last two days have been around the same area. Interestingly, today sideways move was very, very low, coming in at only 53.1M as of 0332PM EST, and  72.5m at closing. When volume is low, movement is very choppy, see the pre/post market for good examples. Scalp at your own risk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSomething that we need to make clear, is that our debt based economy (which we've had ever since we stopped balancing the federal budget) is based on the very obvious Ponzi scheme of \"kick the can down the road\", or \"we promise we'll balance the debt next year, but we need our stuff now\". The balancing never comes, and the can gets a little bigger each time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe United States doesn't make enough in tax revenue to pay its bills, period. In a regular year, without beer flu or killer hornets, we're borrowing every year. Eventually, this was gonna crash if we didn't pay it down and start balancing the budget, which is not an American priority.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow is this financed, if we don't pay enough taxes?\n\nEach year the USA takes out loans, via the selling of various bond type vehicles, to pay for its missing budget gap. Like a Ponzi scheme, this eventually collapses, as the US Gov't needs to use our tax dollars, which it already doesn't have enough of, to service these bonds. How does it use our tax dollars to service bonds, if it already doesn't have enough tax dollars? Why, just sell more bonds, silly! You know, like using a new credit card to pay last months credit card bill. What could go wrong? We've been doing this for many decades, building up the debt you read about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBonds are basically payed out two ways. Longer term bonds (like the 30 year) pay out every six months, at some rate that is set based on rates at the time of the issuing (30 year bonds generally have the highest interest rate, because they require the longest investment period). Additionally, they payout face value + any outstanding interest owed on the bond at maturity (expiration) . If the bond doesn't have an as-you-go interest payment, than the holder collects all of the accrued interest of the bond at maturity. There are some other small nuances, but this is the general \"how they work\". The payments every 6 months are a large portion of what I refer to when I say \"servicing the debt\".  We were at 23T in debt in OCT 2019, and we're taking on 10T+ for this crisis.\n\nIf we calculated 25T at the current 30 year rate of 1.24% (obviously it'll be not this simple, some is higher, some is lower, and we'll need to see the balance sheet and bond info to calculate properly), that would mean every 6 months we paid:\n\n310,000,000,000 or 310B, or 620B per year, just in interest. It adds up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy does this matter? Bonds are payed out in US currency. The strength of the US Bond is that it is revered around the world as the safest investment you could make. This gives the USA access to liquidity from other countries, and political power as the 'reserve' currency. It also helps establish the dollar as a \"strong\" currency, which is actually \\*not\\* always a good thing for international trading, for reasons such as it isn't always as profitable for other weaker nations to trade with us when their dollar isn't as good as ours, resulting in unfavorable rates for them. This actually reduces the amount of trade we have access to as a by-product.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile we're on topic, the amount of bond selling the USA does to generate liquidity is what you hear about being referred to as the 'debt ceiling'. If we don't raise the debt ceiling, we can't sell bonds (get loans) to other entities to pay our bills. Currently the debt ceiling is suspended, allowing us to go into the hole as much as we want, which further reinforces the Feds \"infinite QE\" position.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf the debt the USA is required to service is too great, than our own tax dollars will be doing nothing but paying interest on these credit card bills. Any anyone that has ever juggled that before can tell you, it eventually fails. What happens if the USA defaults? Many, many bad things. A lot of the value of US currency is specifically tied to the trust that the USA will never default. We'd see an immediate deep depression, if we're not already there, and currency would hyper-inflate in an extremely short amount of time, as demand for the dollar would immediately drop, dropping its value. Trump deciding to \"not pay on our Chinese debt in retaliation for CV19\" would be disastrous for our economy, and the world economy. We'd be extremely likely to lose our status as the 'reserve' currency of the world, which could fall to any other strong currency.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat was discovered, however, in the crash of 2008, is that Quantitative Easing (QE) doesn't cause hyper inflation when the dollar remains strong during a worldwide recession. That is, because the dollar IS the reserve currency, nations in turmoil seek to flock to it for safety, driving up its 'value', and countering the effects of inflation. When currency is hoarded by the nations flocking to it, world trade goes down significantly, driving up prices on goods and services, just as it had the affect here locally when banks hoarded the QE cash in 2008 rather than loaning it out as intended. Simply put, 'too scared to spend, but desperate to hoard' keeps the dollar from inflating.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe doubly constrains international trade, as a strong dollar already makes it more difficult for people seeking to import US goods internationally, because their currency conversion rate isn't very favorable, while making it easier for Americans to import other countries goods due to our stronger dollar. Further more, when dollars are hard to get, countries are unwilling to give them to other countries, and other countries only want dollars in exchange for their goods. Vicious cycle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy does any of this matter to your trading right now? The Bears that keep dying off are the ones that keep trying to find food in the middle of Winter. There isn't any food, you have to wait for spring. The QE process supports local AND international markets, and with the strong demand for the dollar world-wide right now, it won't inflate at nearly the rate you expect, until it just plain crashes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOK, so what causes it to crash? Well, QE works by selling our debt (bonds) to other countries (or large institutions) to generate liquidity, and using said liquidity (formerly for buying various Gov bonds, and since QE began, by buying bonds and other longer term securities from the private sectors) to give to our own country more money to \"get the wheels going\". The Interest rates on the QE inside the country are going for near 0%-.25% to help spurn the economy, and although the bond market has also has low rates right now (Last Value for a 30 year 5/3/2020: 1.24%), it is still not an equal balance. The USA will owe more to these bond holders than it produces via its loans to the private sector(s). If those other countries stop having revenue to buy our bonds, the process fails to work, because it loses the necessary liquidity. If the Fed attempts to print without getting loans from other countries, thereby \"printing\" money out of air, the dollar will begin to devalue if enough is printed that worldwide demand for it begins to ease, lowering its demand levels and therefore its price.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy would other countries not have the money to buy our bonds?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChina: 20% unofficial unemployment rate:\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-27/china-brokerage-retracts-estimate-that-real-jobless-level-is-20](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-27/china-brokerage-retracts-estimate-that-real-jobless-level-is-20)\n\n(ctrl a + ctrl c before the bloomberg pop-up wall to copy the text and paste to notepad to read for free)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIndia: 27% unemployed:\n\n[https://www.firstpost.com/business/coronavirus-lockdown-indias-unemployment-rate-soars-to-27-11-for-week-ended-3-may-says-cmie-8334891.html](https://www.firstpost.com/business/coronavirus-lockdown-indias-unemployment-rate-soars-to-27-11-for-week-ended-3-may-says-cmie-8334891.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnemployment rates in Europe expected to \"near double\":\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-eu-jobs/mckinsey-predicts-near-doubling-of-unemployment-in-europe-idUSKBN2210UZ](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-eu-jobs/mckinsey-predicts-near-doubling-of-unemployment-in-europe-idUSKBN2210UZ)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSimply put, there is gonna be a whole lot of \"no fuckin tax money\" going around, and a whole lotta people needing money for basics at the same time. This is gonna be a strange thing to dig out when everyone is printing money at the same time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat does this mean to your tendies? Puts are simply not good overall play for the short term, outside of specific target movements (day trades, bad earnings, bankruptcy of an individual company, targeting a specific weak industry). I play straddle variations (and day trade shares) because it plays off of volatility increasing, which is should continue to do, although theta gangs are likely making the best reliable wages of all of us, selling hopes and dreams to dying bears. I'll likely switch to a few upward theta plays this week after my straddles tonight come back .\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo! This post is already long, lets make it a little longer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you've been following along, you'll know I don't DD individual companies for you to bet on, but rather the market as a whole:\n\nWe know chicken, pork, dairy, potato, and onion farming are affected, and in multiple countries. (links in previous threads)\n\nWe know oil continues to be affected at rock bottom pricing, and oil futures suggest it will stay that way for a while (link in previous threads)\n\nWe know some types of home-based loans have been affected (HELOCs, and others further defined below).\n\nWe know unemployment is high, not just here, but world wide, 20%+ in multiple major countries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nu/Breezy_t has some great DD regarding the mortgages starting to wobble a bit, another one of our expected indicators. I expect to see this really start to move next month as the 3 delay and 4th month approaches with all of those payments suddenly due. While not all lenders did it this way, enough of them did that it should get ugly. If another stimulus is passed, I would expect this to get delayed, but won't guess how long without seeing the stimulus.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ge5nnl/us\\_households\\_had\\_record\\_debt\\_when\\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ge5nnl/us_households_had_record_debt_when_the/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nu/Sufficientlee shows us the Beef Industry, last of the major meat players in the USA has started to creak:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ge3p01/1\\_in\\_5\\_wendys\\_out\\_of\\_beef/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ge3p01/1_in_5_wendys_out_of_beef/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nu/Phosgene1394 brings us DD about confirmation of the 2nd Strain. I've read there are 19 in total so far, but a particular strain being very infectious, this is important because vaccinations against one may not work against others, like the flu:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ge9s6m/beer\\_virus\\_mutated\\_spy\\_350\\_bois/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ge9s6m/beer_virus_mutated_spy_350_bois/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs previously mentioned, I reached out to a friend of mine at a major mortgage lender this weekend. She handles VA, FHA, and Conventional loans for home buyers, primarily. We didn't speak about commercial loans. Here is what she gave me:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVA loan minimum fico requirements bumped from 620-660.\n\nFHA loan minimum fico requirements bumped from 640-660.\n\nConventional loans require minimum 700 fico or automatic bump to FHA loans, which are less favorable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe also mentioned a couple of things I expected would happen, including the non-official delivery of them (no paperwork)\n\nShe was told to \"use discretion\" giving out home equity refi's.\n\nShe was told to \"use discretion about companies/industries applicants work for\" IE if your job might be affected by CV19, she might deny you based on \"nothing\". Because this could be seen as discrimination, you can't tell someone you didn't lend to them because they work for a restaurant, but you can tell them the bank simply couldn't qualify them at this time.\n\nShe also said the financial lending programs are sending out new guidance basically every day, updating and tightening requirements as we get farther into this and the bigger picture comes out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, use your own judgement as to whether I'm making all of that up to fit my narrative, it's not something I can exactly source for you, for obvious reasons.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's what I can tell you about my straddle test plays over-night, which I've decided to back off on for now:\n\n1st) +$124 for (1) straddle contract, but Trump ruined the test by rattling sabers with China\n\n2nd) Would have broke even (+$) If I'd woke up on time, but instead I ate a small loss with an early retrace to strike eating my gains.\n\n3rd - weekend) +$24 for (1) straddle contract due to a parabolic move overnight sunday reversing the down gap with an upward climb. I believe with the general upward trend that even down gaps will reverse like this moving forward until the bankruptcies / failures start to roll in.\n\n4) -$270 Bought (3) straddle contracts on 5/5/2020 at EOD after that crazy downward plunge and some reversal, strike 287, and once again after hours went parabolic, resulting in the worst possible outcome, opening the next day at 287, almost exactly where I bought it. This is a good example, however, that my worst case scenario resulted in a slightly over 12% loss on the purchase, so this was relatively safe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"What should I buy?\"\n\nWell, SPY is largely biased towards Tech, which is largely less affected by recession. If you're playing SPY, and you want larger returns than a straddle will give, I'd stick with calls, and don't oversize your bets and get eaten by down-gaps. You will lose some overnights, but you should win more than you lose. You could hedge an OTM Put for some cheap safety for a wide strangle if you're so inclined. I would generally try and use a strike close to a low-volatility low if it bounces down in the mid day, especially if you end up close enough to a high volume strike during the mid-day IV reduction. If you look back, 3/4 of the last gaps were down, but 7/10 of the last gaps were ups. Most importantly, as those last 3 gaps were in a row, they might simply be the 'pull back' of the previous 6 ups.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese are the industries I would bet against right now, if I weren't in SPY:\n\n\\-Anything that sells: chicken pork, beef, dairy, potato, and onion as a primary source of revenue.\n\n\\-Anything that is involved in the oil-supply chain, except maybe oil storage, we'll see if OPEC + friends's  production reductions (9.7 million barrels per day) are enough to keep these from sky-rocketing. These stocks seem super unstable as their value is artificially super high for the short term until oil is under control again. Note that in the energy markets, non-oil power production has done fairly well.\n\n\\-Mortgage lenders and PMI Companies starting next month. Note, these won't fall right away, so set your dates accordingly.\n\n\\-Car manufacturers, these suffered terribly in 2007/8/9 and eventually had to be bailed out. The same thing is likely to happen again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm tightening my expectations of daily movement from 1.5-2.5% up and 1.5% down, to .5-1.25% up, and .5-1.75% down , still not including any overnight gaps. Notably, these gaps have been following trend a bit more often lately. We'll also likely see more 'stall' days (-.5% to +.5%) as we seem to be in a low volume 'plateau' of sorts. If you day trade / scalp, its dicey out there so take your profits a bit early, if your runs start to waver pull out and re-enter if necessary, the downs are spiking hard this last week, and can reset an hour+ of gains in a single 1 minute bar.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't bet on the next \"down\" just yet, QE is a strong delay method but it doesn't plant crops. Fundamentals are most likely to win this fight in a big way, but you can't hurry them. QE is like building a 10 foot sandbag wall to stop a tsunami that you're expecting to arrive any day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy positions currently?\n\nCash only day trading again until I have time to figure out my preferred theta plays, although some solar energy earnings are coming in next week and renewables have done very well so far, so I may dip my toe for a few calls there. If you can handle the waves, there is great scalping right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL:DR: QE will keep destroying your puts because people don't know how QE works. Play shorts only with great DD, and safer play is avoid shorting tech all together.  Short companies according to fundamentals, and be more confident (and riskier) in short term calls. Stop losses are getting chopped through and flash crashed, so try to stick to with-trend plays, not counter-trend.  Calls > puts rights now. Good luck autists, +15% tendies for everyone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedited for slightly less shitty formatting.
