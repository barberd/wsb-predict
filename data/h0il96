{"id": "h0il96", "title": "Intelsat to the moon??", "selftext": "I just used my Bar Mitzvah savings on this 10 bagger! Intelsat is the company responsible for the spectrum transmission between satellites and earth and auctions off these rights to AT&T, Verizon, and TMUS. They've filed ch11 but wall st is missing a BIG component. The bonds are expected to get over par value which means there could be a lot of residual value for the equity. The reason the bonds are worth above par is that by December 8th Intelsat will receive a massive $4.8B payment from the FCC auction!! The company has a little over 14.5B in debt. The business itself is worth conservatively $8B post ch11, and they'll have 4B in cash when they relist. Adding these up: 4.8 + 7 + 4 = $15.8 B\n\nThis might not sound like a lot but 15.8 - 14.5 = $1.3B in equity value. The stock trades at $119m. That's a 10x return! I'm loading up on calls here. The govt can't have these guys go under. The rights they own are far too valuable!", "created_utc": 1591818510.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h0il96/intelsat_to_the_moon/", "is_self": true}
