Thought I'd leave [this](https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections) here as the gov't is using these projections at the moment. Check on this often as adjustments are made, but the model appears quite accurate so far. Based on this, we should be out of the woods by July. Since most economic recoveries start before the underlying event finishes, **I would highly recommend not holding puts beyond mid-May.** Until then, keep on \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08.\n\nhttps://covid19.healthdata.org/projections\n\n\nTL;DR: per model projections, crisis should be mostly over by July. Make sure you're not holding SPY puts by May.\n\nEDIT 1: I think the equity market recovery will precede the economic recovery. Even with high unemployment, stocks will still rally to previous heights as businesses catch up.\n\nAs for why this would be a massive bull V-shaped rally just based on what we know so far: look at the jobs report today:\n*The number of job losers on temporary layoff showed a large spike upward (by more than 1 million people).\n*The number of permanent job losers showed only a small increase (by less than 200,000 people). \n\nCertainly, things can change in the next month, but if the model holds and no big surprises out of left field, the rally should be explosive.", "created_utc": 1585960212.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fujybc/when_to_stop_being/", "is_self": true}
