Here's why I think the economic and behavioral impact of the coronavirus is over, and the virus itself is going to just fade out with no second wave. \n\nI went hiking this weekend in NJ/NY and it was fucking packed beyond belief (parking lot was overfilled), and I talked to the workers there and its been like this all month. You can go on social media and see all sorts of situations where people are out and about in groups. Couple that with the massive protests which started in late May (more than 14d ago, which is the time of coronavirus incubation period) where massive amounts of people congregated. So people have been congregating and spreading the virus since over 2 weeks ago, and you would expect the new cases to go up. So second wave is coming right?\n\nBut if you look at coronavirus cases, it has been steadily dropping with no new spikes.\n\nHere's a chart of new cases in the US holding steady with no spikes:\n\n[https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[US daily new cases](https://preview.redd.it/1geykqyac4551.png?width=1409&format=png&auto=webp&s=b459a99ab2fe525bc7c6f0d1149fff55fa00cd8c)\n\nMore importantly, here's NY, which was once the hot spot, and where I went hiking\n\n[https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/usa/new-york/](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/usa/new-york/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[NY daily new cases](https://preview.redd.it/02dhhukyb4551.png?width=1405&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7a6e7d22c1deee955589720147aee98b28d7e36)\n\nIn my mind coronavirus no longer has a material impact on people's leisure and travel behaviors, and I'm gonna put all my marbles on the beat up stocks (NCLH, CCL, LUV, DAL) and wait for 2x-3x in a year.\n\nEDIT: according to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html):  The incubation period for COVID-19 is thought to extend to 14 days, with a median time of 4-5 days from exposure to symptoms onset.\n\nEDIT: YOLO proof\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8aq6z16cj4551.png?width=1933&format=png&auto=webp&s=c75046b33eb1129421a755aabc54560e746ed027", "created_utc": 1592246374.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h9m3c4/coronavirus_over_going_allin_on_cruises_and/", "is_self": true}
