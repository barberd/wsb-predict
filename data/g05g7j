Another community voted YOLO.\n\nOriginal: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flmef2/wsb\\_community\\_voted\\_yolo/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flmef2/wsb_community_voted_yolo/)\n\nThe rules are the same. Post a weekly Yolo (expiring no later than 4/20) for 5k. If I hit 100% profit on the Yolo I will sell and give you 10% of profits or let it ride and try to make/lose us some more money.\n\nRight now, the record is 1 for 2. The first pick by u/SoBubbles hit and he got paid.  [https://imgur.com/gallery/CGBt3iA](https://imgur.com/gallery/CGBt3iA)\n\nThe last Yolo on CMG I sold too early, re-bought and lost 8k so I'm looking for a winner.\n\nCurrent positions are some bullshit on INDA that's lost me 6k, SPY 6/19 235p, SPY 5/15 220p, and a stupid INTL position.\n\nOn another note, I'm furloughed for the next week with nothing to do but daytrade. Ran my account up from 3k-almost 75k now. Withdrew 30k and will be trying to turn that 35k into 100k by end of week. If I like your play a lot, I might throw 10k at it or maybe pick 2.\n\nI will edit this post with a futures YOLO when it opens.\n\nBest/funniest DD wins. Give me something unique - not SPY 250p or something equally unoriginal. I'm into credit spreads and all that shit too so don't think it has to be a one-way play. Having a tough time? Let's make money together.\n\nThere are a million ways to fuck this goat, I'm just holding the legs.", "created_utc": 1586727755.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g05g7j/wsb_community_voted_yolo_pt_3/", "is_self": true}
