Long time trader. Worked in the biz, then left a few years ago. Still manage my PA and what not, though. Recently not much active management (definitely nothing like what you crazy fuckers are doing) but I'd like to get back into it now that RH has free everything.\n\nParticularly, I spent some time in the electronic equity options trading group, so would like to bring some of those strategies to WSB.\n\nBut to do so, I need some help from the autists:\n\n1. Where can you look up volatility surfaces without Bloomberg? RH doesn't tell me the IV of an option until after I buy it. Or the greeks. Anyone know how to get a real-time option chain with all that info updated in the app? If not, some other app you recommend?\n2. Why isn't there a vega gang? The next easiest thing to predict after the passage of time is the reversion of vol.\n3. What is the core idea of \"theta gang\"? Are you just trying to get all the greeks neutral and then sell some theta to pick up pennies on the train tracks?\n4. What the fuck are tendies? (Is that positive P/L?)\n\nLook forward to pulling in big P/L with you guys. I think it's tendies, but correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nAnd finally - **you guys fucking rock**. I've loved trading for a long time, but never had people from my own generation to talk to about it. Thank you for making this group. I'm quite excited about it.\n\nPS - would be huge to have some kind of intro doc pinned up at the top that answers this kind of stuff.", "created_utc": 1581623519, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3fqa0/couple_questions_for_all_yall_autists_on_how_to/", "is_self": true}
