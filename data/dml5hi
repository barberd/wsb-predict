The company guided Q2 revenue to $35.15-35.95B (vs. the $35.95B consensus estimate) and reaffirmed double-digit revenue and operating income growth. Calls are outnumbering puts roughly 2:1 with the October 25th 140.00 call being the most actively traded contract (volume is 20,947).\nTesla Inc. (TSLA + $46.32 to $301.10): The electric car maker reported Q3 earnings of $1.91 per share ($2.19 beat) on revenue that fell 7.6% year-over-year to $6.3B (above the $6.48B expected). Free cash flow came in at $371M while GAAP EPS came in at $0.80 versus expectations for a $0.23 loss and GAAP automotive gross margins improved 393 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 22.8%. The company said that the Shanghai Gigafactory and trial production of Model Y are both ahead of schedule. Shares of TSLA are trading at a seven-month high following the results. Puts are outnumbering calls roughly 6:5 with the October 25th 290.00 put seeing the most action from traders (volume is 20,136).\n \n\nNew 52-week highs (127 new highs today): Apple Inc. (AAPL - $1.03 to $242.15), Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT + $3.46 to $53.99), Edward Life Sciences Inc. (EW + $9.49 to $234.67), JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM - $0.70 to $124.42)\n\nNotable Call Activity\n\nSome unusual call activity (~4:1 over puts) is being seen in Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI + $0.66 to $55.46) as option traders primarily target three contracts that expire at the end of this week (October 25th) \u2013 the 55.00 call (volume is 11,425 vs. open interest of 2,285), the 55.50 call (volume is 3,807 vs. open interest of 1,246) and 56.00 call (volume is 3,210 vs. open interest of 952).  \n\nAlso seeing some heavy call activity is Michael\u2019s Companies (MIK - $0.06 to $10.29): Calls are outpacing puts roughly 30:1 which is mostly being driven by a 6,452 block that was bought on the November 15th 12.50 call at the ask price of $0.20 (open interest is 15,581).\n\nLastly, calls are outpacing puts better than 10:1 on the Direxion Daily MSCI Brazil Bull 3X ETF (BRZU - $0.24 to $31.50) which is primarily being driven by a 4,650 block that was bought on the November 1st 33.00 call at the ask price of $1.00 (open interest is 39). We know this block is a new position and we can assume the intent is bullish in nature since the trade took place at the ask price.\n\nToday\u2019s Bearish Activity \n\nSeveral stocks are trading lower following quarterly earnings results:\n\nAlliance Data Systems Inc. (ADS - $20.83 to $102.92): The provider of data-driven marketing and loyalty solutions reported Q3 earnings of $5.05 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.20 miss) on revenue the rose 1.1% year-over-year to $1.44B (slightly below the $1.45B analysts had expected). In terms of guidance the company stated the following, \u201cRecent prime rate changes, an adjustment to the value of certain held-for-sale credit card receivable portfolios, and lower average receivables caused an aggregate reduction in expected core EPS. As a result of these factors, the company has lowered its full-year 2019 core EPS guidance to $16.75-17.00. Calls are outnumbering puts roughly 4:3 but the March 2020 85.00 put is attracting the most attention from traders (volume is 161).\n3M Co. (MMM - $7.28 to $161.48): The maker of Post-it notes, Scotch tape and other industrial and health-care products reported Q3 GAAP earnings of $2.72 per share, ($0.20 beat) on revenue that fell 2.0% year-over-year to $7.99B (below the $8.2B expected). The company issued downside guidance as Q4 GAAP EPS is expected to come in a range of $2.05-2.15 versus the $2.37 consensus estimate. Shares of MMM are just below the 50-day SMA ($161.95) at the time of this writing. Puts are slightly outnumbering calls but the November 15th 172.50 call is leading the way (volume is 3,448).\nTwitter Inc. (TWTR - $7.46 to $31.37): The social media company reported Q3 earnings of $0.14 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.06 miss) on revenue that increased 8.7% year-over-year to $824M (below the $875.21M expected). The company issued downside guidance as Q4 revenue is expected to come in a range of $940-1.01B (vs. the $1.05B consensus estimate) with operating income expected to come in a range of $130-170M (vs. the $207M expected). Shares of TWTR are trading at a seven-month low this morning. Calls are outnumbering puts roughly 3:2 but the October 25th 31.00 put is seeing the most action from traders (volume is 15,856).\n \n\nNew 52-week lows (34 new lows today): CBS Corp. (CBS - $0.86 to $35.63), Nokia Corp. (NOK - $1.21 to $3.90), Six Flags Entertainment Corp. (SIX - $0.43 to $44.45)\n\nNotable Put Activity\n\nSome unusual put activity (~3:1 over calls) is being seen in UBER Technologies Inc. (UBER + $0.16 to $33.22) which is primarily due to some block activity on two strike prices on the November 15th expiration:\n\n30.00 put (open interest is 11,329): a 1,745 block was bought at the ask price of $1.10 and (later on) a 755 block was bought for $1.07 when the bid/ask spread was $1.00 x $1.10\n25.00 put (open interest is 21,290): a 1,745 block was sold at the bid price of $0.20 and (later on) a 755 block was sold for $0.17 when the bid/ask spread was $0.15 x $0.25\nThese blocks were coded as spread trades but we can\u2019t be sure that they represent new bear put spreads given the respective open interest figures on these contracts. Note: UBER is scheduled to report Q3 earnings on November 4th after the market close so this positioning captures the potential impact of that event.\n\nVolume Signals     \n\nCommunity Health Systems Inc. (CYH - $0.15 to $4.31): Option volume is running at over 250x the daily average of 157 contracts which is primarily being driven by a couple of large blocks that simultaneously traded on the November 15th expiration:\n\n4.50 call (open interest is 0): a 20K block was sold for $0.35 when the bid/ask spread was $0.30 x $0.50\n4.50 put (open interest is 0): an 20K block was sold at an average price of $0.43 (a 12K block was sold for $0.40 and an 8K block was sold for $0.45 at the same time) when the bid/ask spread was $0.40 x $0.60\nWe know these blocks are new positions based on the respective open interest figures and it appears that a short straddle was established for net credit of $0.78 (x 20K contracts x 100 multiplier, excluding commissions) which suggests that the block trader believes that CYH will close in between the lower break-even price of $3.72 and the upper break-even price of $5.28 at expiration. The maximum gain for this strategy would occur if CYH closed exactly at $4.50 at expiration. Note: CYH is scheduled to report Q3 earnings next Tuesday (October 29th) after the market close so this positioning captures the potential impact of this event.\n\nShares of Chinese e-commerce platform Pinduoduo Inc. (PDD + $2.97 to $38.48) are trading at all-time highs and option traders are taking note. Option volume is running at over 7x the daily average of 3,783 contracts and is call-biased (better than 2:1 over puts) with the November 15th 36.00 call topping the most actives list. Volume on this contract is 5,512 (vs. open interest of 6,054) which mostly consisted of various-sized blocks (450, 450, 450, 446, etc.) that were being bought for $2.80. Note: PDD is scheduled to report Q3 earnings on November 20th before the market open.\n\nAimmune Therapeutics Inc. (AIMT + $0.47 to $26.26): Option volume is running at roughly 60x the daily average of 184 contracts which is primarily being driven by activity on the December 20th 30.00 call. Volume on this contract is 9,977 versus open interest of 2,148, so we know that this primarily represents new positioning. The majority of the volume on this contract consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought for $1.10 and $1.15, which suggests bullish intent.\n\nGauging Volatility\n\nThe CBOE Volatility Index (VIX - 0.09 to 13.92) has been on both sides of the unchanged line today (intraday range is 13.69-14.34) as equity markets are mixed around the mid-day mark today (DJI - 59, SPX + 2, COMPX + 52). VIX option volume has been tepid today (currently missing from the top 10 most actives list) and the activity has been definitively call-biased (the volume put/call ratio is currently 0.23). The most actively traded contract is the November 20th 20.00 call as volume is 15,568 versus open interest of 138,579.", "created_utc": 1571944383, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dml5hi/options_market_102419/", "is_self": true}
