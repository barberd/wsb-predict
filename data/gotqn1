There was a HR of .46 in a less severe group 4, but the sample size was smaller so looks like there's a power issue. This matches up with the theory - an antiviral like remdesivir is more likely to benefit when used early (more moderate patients) than patients that already need a vent.\n\nSubgroup analysis is messy and there are other trials that will probably dig into this better, but IMO this is a fairly promising result. I think the market has been pretty unenthused by $GILD recently but I think this could help it pop a bit, particularly as more studies come out.\n\nPositions: $GILD 6/19 $77c", "created_utc": 1590188104.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gotqn1/gild_remdesivir_trial_results_potential_mortality/", "is_self": true}
