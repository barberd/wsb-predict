Someone is going to be responsible for laying out the infrastructure for this entire operation.\n\nYou have telecommunications that have to be put in place, engineering, space, and of course management and implementation.\n\nI'm focusing on those that have been or had a part in NASA and the defense sector before. The quick search I did on \"large gov contractors\" brought up Boeing, Raytheon, Northrup Grumman, General Dynamic, SAIC, Level three (now CenturyLink), Leidos and Lockhead Martin, AT&amp;T, Verizon and a few more. Right now my Google search has those as the 'top players in government contracts.'\n\nWill follow up when I pull the trigger... Going to load up on calls... leaps 5-10% OTM.\n\nOne of those companies has got to hit a contract soon... Can anyone point me to some DD that may support this?", "created_utc": 1566372324, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ctddlz/i_am_thinking_about_going_long_on_a_few_govenment/", "is_self": true}
