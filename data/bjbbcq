Average about 300-400/hour over last 3-4 years of trading - should me advice to you all", "selftext": "Title says it all, I\u2019m going to offer up my story and then some tidbits of advice.\n\nI started trading at 24.  A boss of mine told me how he found a way to make insane cash from interest free loans (balance cedes with 0% for 18 months).  So I started trading and read a lot of books.  After 3-4 months I went from breakeven to making about 1% per day from stocks.  I was purely technical.  In and out in and out using about 2x margin.  I made a ton on WNR and TSTC and a bunch of other momentum stocks.\n\nI was crushing it.  I near tripled my money.\n\nI then found a company called dendreon. In this I read a post on some board about these things called calls (options).  I did my research and decided to take a huge position (50% of my 35k portfolio).  The stock moved from 4 to 16 and then based on a rumor went back down to 4!  It was easy money.\n\nI proceeded to learn what theta was.  I lost 75% in less than a day due to the volatility drop and then I got lucky and it went from 4 back to 10!  \n\nI was rich and right!  \n\nI almost had a heart attack.  Losing that much money in a day, but I was hooked.  I proceeded to lose all my profits and the 35k in the next 2 weeks on different companies.  I didn\u2019t understand options.\n\nI said to myself - I can do this I\u2019m smart.  I work hard.  So I opened up 2 new CCs and lost 25k more.  37k in debt now.\n\nAs I was only making 60k at the time the interest was making me bleed cash and I was running net negative.  My 37k of debt became 50 in a year.\n\nI worked 80-100 hours a week over the next 2 years and paid bills and got promoted and huge raises.  Never did anything else but drink date and eat.\n\nI slowly amassed enough money over the next 3 years to pay off my 50k in CC debt. But the ride was not over.  I began trading options on FAS.  I began crushing it.  10k became 130k.  Due to 1 piece of news while I was not at my computer for an hour and averaging down I lost it all... again.  I cried that next day.  Not that day.  I was too numb.\n\nI didn\u2019t get why certain technicals would not work.  Rinse repeat the next 2 years and finally...FINALLY I made enough mistakes to start breaking even.  I would deposit 20k. Make 20k and then withdraw the principle... and then fuck up again.  Bad bankroll management.\n\nFast forward 2 more years and I finally started to get it.  No more huge rookie mistakes.\n\nI finally invested enough time and made enough mistakes to be profitable.  FINALLY.  I was squeaking out 5k here and 10k there.  Probably 40k a year from swing trading options.\n \n6 years ago I started my own company.  Last year I wound it down and started to trade more.  40 hours a week.  My best month?  270k. Crushed it.  Easy mode. I was having a really bad time with a woman and lost it ALL in a DAY.  I lost all my discipline and said fuck it - I broke all my rules.  A 50k loss turned into a 300k loss because I said fuck it.  150k due to theta.\n\nBelieve it or not I wasn\u2019t really upset.  Within 2 weeks I traded perfectly and recuperated my 30k loss and made back 100k of the profits.\n\nI\u2019ve battled some demons but i finally vanquished my demons and mistakes.  I ventured into algorithmic trading and my tool makes me about 15k a month.  Not insane money but really takes care of everything I need.\n\nSo my advice to you all:\n\n- Invest in yourself.  \n- DONT TAKE OUT DEBT TO TRADE\n- don\u2019t trade earnings (its roulette)\n- learn wyckoff (its the ONLY thing that matters... you can do Elliott waves, financial analysis) but Wyckoff is the ONLY thing that dictates the future because it is based off of psychology.\n- read reminiscences of a stock operator \n- download a tool to help you learn algo trading (NinjaTrader works) it will help you prove that what you THINK you know ACTUALLY works\n- don\u2019t bother trading options until you can ACTUALLY win 90% of the time in stocks by truly day trading\n- STAY AWAY FROM DAILY OR WEEKLY OPTIONS!!!!\n- understand when and why options decay. \n- Understand when options actually expire\n- keep a journal\n- and above all learn that trying to be smarter than everyone else and going short will RUIN your trading account.  You will see that if you just stick to long only and either 1-2 week setups or 1-2 hour... long only you will crush it.\n\nno matter how smart you think you are.  The market is smarter, don\u2019t try to win a million.  Try to make 500 a day, every day.  And want to know what happens?  You hit a bunch of singles and eventually start catching 5-10 baggers.  \n\nSo - if you have questions.  Fire away.  Anyone can be insanely profitable if you stop lying to yourselves.", "created_utc": 1556673004, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bjbbcq/profitable_options_trader_average_about/", "is_self": true}
