{"id": "gnbn3h", "title": "A lesson in realizing gains", "selftext": "Being the superior autist that I am, a few weeks back I made some gains. I even closed those positions in real life for a profit. Not only that, but I withdrew some to my bank account! \n\nNow it was a lonely Saturday night in my American Psychoesque perfectly clean apartment for 1 due to my chronic OCD, and my tinder prospects were flaking due to \u201cnot wanting to break quarantine.\u201d So be it, my time is valuable. I felt disgusting wasting a few hours talking with these wastes of life who would begin a never-ending bear market looks-wise in 2 years once they hit 25 years of age. \n\nSo what did I do? You guessed it, I browsed the inter-webs and found a lady of the night. I made gains right, let me celebrate a bit. Now I always go quick visit or whatever cause I\u2019m obviously gonna bust in 5 seconds why pay for extra time? Said honorable woman happened to live right near me, so I said I\u2019d pick her up and bring her to my place so I didn\u2019t have to smash in her god forsaken living space probably littered by cigarette butts and used condoms. \n\nI arrive in my bright red Camaro SS, not an expensive car by any means, but one I thoroughly enjoy. Said lady goes around the front to get into the passenger side and snaps a fucking picture. Great. I\u2019m probably on this whore\u2019s Instagram story. I commence some small talk, then crank some music as she begins to bore me. 3 minutes later, we arrive back to my place.\n\nWe get inside my apartment. \u201cOh your apartment is so fancy.\u201d No it\u2019s not, bitch. It\u2019s just clean because of my OCD and looks presentable because I\u2019m not a whore. To the town I begin to pound, and this bitch answers a call, gets up and says she needs to pay someone money. I stand there dumbfounded and ask her what the fuck am I paying her for? I demand half my cash back. She says \u201cwhat are you gonna do, call the police and tell them I\u2019m a bad hooker?\u201d Now I stand there, Bert-staring, rejected by even the hooker, not knowing what to do. She leaves the apartment, so I begin DD in solitude to recoup losses. \n\nA few days later, I start coughing real bad and have a fever. \u201cWhat the fuck is this?\u201d I think to myself. I get a Covid-19 swab test, a few days later I get the results, and I can\u2019t believe it, this bitch gave me Covid-19, didn\u2019t let me nut, and also took my money. Honestly I wanted the antibodies so I could have an invincible immune system anyways, and the symptoms disappeared in a few days, so whatever I guess, but fuck. The moral of the story is, because I did not fully realize my gains by saving them, the Gods disapproved and struck me with beer flu and rejections by the birds. From now on, I will fully realize gains. God speed.\n\nTL;DR - made gains, tinder thots didn\u2019t want smash cause quarantine, get hooker, hooker takes phone call mid smash, doesn\u2019t let me nut, takes all my money and gives me Covid-19\n\n[Graphic Novel](https://i.imgur.com/kvTytP8.png)", "created_utc": 1589982486.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gnbn3h/a_lesson_in_realizing_gains/", "is_self": true}
