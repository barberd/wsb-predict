Buy AIMT!!!", "selftext": "Hello retards,\n\nToday I bring you DD for another bio-pharm stock that will not moon before you have a chance to get in.  \nThe company name is Aimmune Therapeutics Inc (AIMT).  This stock had an Adcom vote of 7-2 in favor of approval.  \nThese peeps are slinging oral immunotherapy for peanut allergies.\n\nNews of the potential FDA approval for the drug Palforzia (AR101) is not baked in yet at the $32/share price.    \nIn fact, Nestle bought 18% of this company at $30.27!   The PDUFA date is Jan 17,2020 (likely earlier)   \nThis stock has 92% institutional ownership.  Upon approval, tutes will buy more.\n\n A survey of allergists by Piper Jaffray's Christopher Raymond was overwhelmingly positive.   \nOut of 45 allergists polled, 44 said they'd probably prescribe Palforzia if approved by the FDA. \n\nAimmune also submitted a marketing application for Palforzia to the European Medical Agency  \n(Europe\u2019s version of the FDA). A decision is expected in the second half of 2020. \n\nThe FDA approves 90% of positive adcoms.  (This is pretty good odds for those that don't math).  \nIf you heard the parents of the kids aged 4-17 that were in the studies, it was pretty heartwarming.  \nAren't we always saying \"think of the children!\" ??  \nTLDR - Go Long - Let's make those tendies!!!  &lt;3\n\nReferences:\n\n [https://www.allergicliving.com/2019/06/04/longer-trial-increased-level-of-tolerance-to-ar101-peanut-oit-therapy/](https://www.allergicliving.com/2019/06/04/longer-trial-increased-level-of-tolerance-to-ar101-peanut-oit-therapy/) \n\n [https://www.mdmag.com/medical-news/fda-committee-data-ar101-peanut-allergy](https://www.mdmag.com/medical-news/fda-committee-data-ar101-peanut-allergy) \n\n [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4312348-aimmune-high-probability-events-approaching](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4312348-aimmune-high-probability-events-approaching) \n\n [https://www.allergicliving.com/2019/12/12/peanut-patch-therapy-led-to-big-quality-of-life-improvement-for-families/](https://www.allergicliving.com/2019/12/12/peanut-patch-therapy-led-to-big-quality-of-life-improvement-for-families/)", "created_utc": 1577172795, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eey4oq/from_the_autist_that_told_you_to_buy_itci_before/", "is_self": true}
