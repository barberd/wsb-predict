I read all these stories of ppl whose departments get fired and some ppl working remote get lost in the company system...and they get paid to basically do nothing \n\nWell, I\u2019m working in construction management and this job site I\u2019m doing is an absolute disaster. So the company has put me in a shack on the construction site to oversee what is going on. This is multiple year project and we just started moving/leveling dirt....I\u2019ve been sitting in this shack for several months basically just scrolling the internet which led me to WSB. Every now and then we have these meetings and I join the call to say no safety issues and work is on schedule. I even got a fat raise for supposedly getting things back on track\u2014(i haven\u2019t done shit. Nobody comes in, nobody calls, occasionally I walk around to see if workers are working. I join the meeting and that\u2019s it. I once missed a meeting once bc I was jacking off in the bathroom)\n\nAnyways, this sub has led me get into trading. I\u2019m getting AMAZING money doing absolutely nothing but I keep losing it doing retarded shit in the market...\n\nI\u2019m thinking that I should just have calls on msft\ndis, Mcd, and SBUX.... puts everything else....\n\nSomebody give me some damn good advice so my life can be amazinger\n\nGod bless", "created_utc": 1562163642, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c8onri/i_get_paid_to_do_nothing/", "is_self": true}
