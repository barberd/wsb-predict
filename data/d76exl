It compares cost of deep OTM put options to profits after large gap down to get expected value and max # of attempts to get timing right to still breakeven.\n\nI have no position in ROKU and no plans to, just sharing the numbers for fun. Big congrats to the guys who made those fat tendies on ROKU today. \n\nNot sure if anyone on here is thinking of trying something similar and buying deep OTM priced stonks...jk I know what sub I'm on. Here is the data: \n\nImage with more details on the numbers and calculation: https://i.redd.it/jfxf2zaqpvn31.jpg\n\n**Using WEEKLY options and strikes from -10% to -20% OTM puts:**\n\n**-10% OTM Strike:** 4042% gain, profit of $2425, max attempts to breakeven is 41.\n\n**-15% Strike:** 8500% gain, profit of $1600, max attempts to breakeven is 86.\n\n**-20% Strike:** 9700% gain, profit of $970, max attempts to breakeven is 98.\n\n**Using MONTHLY options and strikes from -10% to -20% OTM puts:**\n\n**-10% Strike:** 158% gain, profit of $723, max attempts to breakeven is 2.\n\n**-15% Strike:** -12% loss, profit of -$27, max attempts to breakeven is 0. (yes this a loss even after today's move)\n\n**-20% Strike:** -100% loss, profit of -$155, max attempts to breakeven is 0. (yes this a loss too).\n\n*This example is a non-earnings week and non-earnings month, the numbers tend to look very different (worse) when calculated for trades when earnings are on calendar before expiration. Also this is just an example, don't infer or assume anything about any other stocks or even about ROKU, every trade is different. Also this is the internet, post may be full of errors and written by a retard, not advice.*", "created_utc": 1569042785, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d76exl/timing_and_strike_selection_of_deep_otm_puts_roku/", "is_self": true}
