{"id": "b4dmnc", "title": "How to be slightly less autistic with options", "selftext": "At the request of another redditor, I am making my first post and describing how to actually make money off of options consistently. I do not know if there is a name for this strategy, but it is pretty well-known and it works. It might be called \"the wheel,\" but today was the first time I've heard that term used. You need about $2,500 to do it fruitfully.\n\nI remember 3 things when I trade options:\n\n1) There are a thousand dipshits out there who will literally pay me to buy their shares  for less than what they are worth (this happens when you sell cash-covered calls); I should be grateful to them.\n\n2) Smart people sell options while wretches gamble.\n\n3) The more you trade, the more you lose.\n\nBy incorporating cash-covered puts and covered calls into your options trading, you can build a more sustainable source of income rather than YOLOing to such an extent that you're checking your positions at 10 PM on a Saturday knowing the market is closed.\n\n\"Cash-covered put\" means that you sell a put at a strike price at which you can afford to buy 100 shares if you're assigned. For example, if you have $2,650 in cash, you can sell a cash-covered put on AMD at a strike of $26.50 and collect about $80 in premium. If you're assigned, you'll have 100 shares of AMD and the $80 you got for selling the put.\n\n\"Covered call\" means you sell a call on a position you already have 100 shares of. For example, if you just got assigned those 100 AMD shares, you can sell a covered call the following week at a strike of $26.50 and collect another $80. If they get called-away, you'll sell the lot for $2,650 and keep the $80 you got for selling the call.\n\nIf we follow our example above further, you just made $160, or 6%, in about 2 weeks. And the $160 you got for selling your call and put can buy you about 7 \"extra\" shares of AMD.\n\nIf you're interested in this method so you can sleep at night, try the following:\n\n1) Pick a stock you want to own and save up enough money to purchase 100 shares of it. \n\n2) Sell an at-the-money cash-covered put with an expiration date about 1 month out. Right now, AMD $26 puts expiring on April 12 are paying $1.13/share in premium, or about 4% in 3 weeks. A strike price $0.37 out-of-the-money is going for $1.13/share. In other words selling a $26 put will put you about $1.50/share better-off than just flat-out buying the shares today.\n\n3) Collect the premium and chill while the stock does its thing until expiry.\n\n4a) If you get assigned, you'll have the shares you wanted anyway plus a chunk of change.\n\n4b) If you don't get assigned, then you just made about 4% for doing nothing. Go back to step 1 and repeat.\n\n5) If you were assigned, you now own 100 shares and you got some extra $ for selling the put. Now sell a covered-call against the shares you just got assigned. Consider picking the same strike as the put to ensure you stay green across the board. \n\n6) You now have money you got from the put and from the call. If you want, YOLO it. If you'd rather, buy some more shares with it. \n\n7) If your shares are called-away, go back to step 1 and repeat. If your call is not exercised, then sell another at-the-money call and collect premium again.\n\nIt isn't as fun as trading like a wretch. It definitely isn't as sexy. But you'll be more consistent, you'll make more money, and you'll still have fun watching your positions grow. If you really need to YOLO, do it with the premiums you collect. \n\nThe picture is my trades on Alphabet from December/January until I got priced-out by a big move early this month. I rolled the money into AMD, AAPL, and QQQ and am now selling calls and puts against them. The wheel kept turning.\n\nI hope this was helpful to someone.
