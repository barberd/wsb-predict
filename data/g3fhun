{"id": "g3fhun", "title": "FLR a Strong Play in Construction & Infrastructure", "selftext": "I work for Fluor (FLR $8.22) and I feel the stock is a reasonable gamble on the long term and volatile enough to possibly make huge returns in the short term.\n\nDD based on publicly available information only:\n\nFluor reached all time lows a month ago ($2.85) due to a string of earnings losses, an SEC investigation into financial reporting, and a confluence of oil crunch and coronavirus uncertainty. Sounds like a recipe for near bankruptcy after being 80% down from the 52Wk High ($41.91), but hear me out:\n\nSome fundamentals:\n\n1. FLR cash on hand is $1.85B, or $13/share\n2. 1Y Target value of $16.3\n3. Price/Book ratio = 0.74\n4. Forward P/E = 5.87\n5. 5% dividend yield\n6. New CEO, new risk profile, and new management\n7. $33B project backlog\n8. 108 year old company, which has withstood several downturns\n\nCurrent volatility stands at about 112%, leading to some very attractive option opportunities.\n\nThe following events could make this stock jump massively in the short-term:\n\n1. Clearing of SEC investigation with minimal fines\n\n2. Posting a profit on upcoming earnings\n\n3. Passing of infrastructure bill\n\n* Bullish Recommendation:\n\nFLR 12.5c 15JAN21\n\n* Bearish Recommendation:\n\nFLR 5.0p 15JAN21", "created_utc": 1587175396.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g3fhun/flr_a_strong_play_in_construction_infrastructure/", "is_self": true}
