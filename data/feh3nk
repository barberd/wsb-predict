Just cancelled my Germany trip after discussions with my team there and spoke to Delta agent. After a long wait (priority status line which tells you volume of cancellations) she rattled off anything I needed to know in 5 seconds and handled the call like a pro and had definitely been having the same discussion dozens of times daily. Everyone is cancelling flights in the office out the next few months and don\u2019t think everything is priced in for the airlines yet. \n\nAm short delta but like a retard out pretty far til next Jan. \n\nhttps://m.imgur.com/oLd9cCd\n\nTL;DR: DAL Put $40 Jan 21", "created_utc": 1583516699, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/feh3nk/cancelling_trips_definitely_doesnt_seem_proved_in/", "is_self": true}
