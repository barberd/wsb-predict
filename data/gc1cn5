{"id": "gc1cn5", "title": "The Bullish case for NAT.", "selftext": "1.) 28 tankers with Saudi oil, including 14 VLCCs and carrying a total of 43 million barrels, will arrive on the US Gulf and West coasts between 24 April and 24 May.\n\n2.) Early data on OPEC\u2019s April production suggests that it hit 13 month highs in April to 30.25 million bpd. That 30.25 million bpd is a month on month increase of 1.61 million bpd.\n\n3.) The OPEC MOMR showing official April production data will be published on May 13, to which the market will react with falling prices. \n\n4.) The CME recently raised its margin requirements for forward oil contracts. The June contract now requires margin of $10,000.  Given that each contract is 1,000 barrels of oil, simple math tells us that $10 per barrel is a key level to watch in trading.  Should crude fall under the $10 mark, it could trigger margin calls. That could in turn force more selling to raise cash, which sends prices lower, and the vicious cycle continues.\n\n5.) Settlement for June Oil futures contacts is on May 19th. We all remember what happened the day leading up to this last month when oil went negative.\n\n6.) All of this will lead right into NAT earnings on May 18th... \n\n7.) You will hear a loud BOOM! That will be the sound of the \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b blowing up there accounts.\n\nBonus: The most recent weekly API crude inventory build was less than expected at 9.978 million barrels vs the 10.619 million expected. This build was a 3.248 Million barrel decrease from the 13.226 Million barrels from the previous week. The market took this as bullish for oil and oil prices rose and tanker stocks sold off. What the market didn\u2019t realize is that this decrease wasn\u2019t due to increased demand and a recovery. This decrease happened because there isn\u2019t any more storage room available. The market has this data point all wrong. You can\u2019t store oil you don\u2019t have room for.", "created_utc": 1588398605.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gc1cn5/the_bullish_case_for_nat/", "is_self": true}
