{"id": "fk0hgq", "title": "Speculation", "selftext": "Right now we're guessing, or maybe, betting is more accurate, that the spread of the Virus would cause more damaging economic effects than are being predicted by the media are talking about. But, we may be betting ahead of the curve.\n\nPrior to the Virus, global GDP was predicted to be 2.9% growth.\n\n[Goldman Sachs](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/economic-recession-forecast-coronavirus-fuel-us-gdp-contraction-market-goldman-2020-3-1028999426) cut its 2020 US GDP growth to 0.4% compared to its 1.2% estimate. [Quarterly](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-healthcare-coronavirus-goldman/goldman-downgrades-u-s-growth-forecast-for-first-quarter-second-quarter-due-to-coronavirus-idUSKBN21217L), they expect the growth forecast for the first (from +0.7% to 0%) and second quarter (from 0% to -5%). Yet, they raised their third (from 1% to 3%) and fourth quarter forecast (from 2.25% to 4%).\n\n[JP Morgan](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/gim/adv/insights/market-insights/weekly-economic-update) actually just comes right out and says it. Recession with two negative quarters in the 2nd and 3rd quarters.\n\n[Schwab](https://www.schwab.com/resource-center/insights/content/quarterly-market-outlook) couches their advice in a whole bunch of caveats and no firm numbers. \n\nWTF, Schwab, put your balls on the table and make a prediction. (Though, I should give them a little bit of leeway since this was the top hit on the Google and I didn\u2019t do any further searching). \n\nAnyway, the key takeaway from their squishy reporting seems to be your retirement money is safe, because \u201cHistorically, stock indexes have tended to return to their previous trajectory within a few months of the peak in global new-case growth.^(1)\u201d \n\nAnd see, there\u2019s the rub for me right there. That little footnoted ^(1) above the end of growth. This whole statement is based on the \u201creturns of the MSCI World Index from 01/01/1970 through 2/28/2020, including the following global outbreaks: HIV/AIDS (1981), pneumonic plague (1994), SARS (2003), H5N1 avian flu (2006), dengue fever (2006), H1N1 swine flu (2009), cholera (2010), MERS (2013), Ebola (2014, 2018), measles (2014, 2019) and Zika (2016). Past performance is no guarantee of future results.\u201d\n\nNow, do any of those virus outbreaks resemble what we are facing today? Did any of those viruses actually go viral across the world? I don\u2019t think so.\n\nHowever, that is the market we\u2019re facing. I still have co-workers thinking this is nothing worse than getting a cold/flu and that this is the bottom and will bounce back in June.\n\nOn the other side of that, we have this report from the [National Center for Biotechnology Information](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/) in which, if you scroll down to the \u201ceconomic impacts\u201d (just do a Ctrl-F), they state \u201cThe direct fiscal impacts of pandemics generally are small, however, relative to the indirect damage to economic activity and growth.\u201d \n\nTo clarify, the cost of developing the drugs, building hospitals, buying additional ventilators, testing individuals are small compared to the indirect damage.\n\nAnd even further down it gets worse, \u201cWorld Bank economic simulations indicate that a severe pandemic could reduce world gross domestic product (GDP) by roughly 5 percent.\u201d \n\nLet that sink in a little. Goldman is predicting a 0.8% decrease in GDP, and we\u2019re looking down the barrel of a -3.8% GDP (according to World Bank simulations).\n\nThey conclude the economic impact section with this statement: \u201cA sustained, severe pandemic on the scale of the 1918 influenza pandemic could cause significant and lasting economic damage.\u201d\n\nSo, what\u2019s it all mean, I don\u2019t know, except that it looks bad to me. And, if my experience with the Coronavirus is any indication, it\u2019s going to be bad.  When China actually quarantined a large portion of it\u2019s population, the world markets blew it off, and then a month later we finally feel the effects\u2026 The fact that all G7 nations have decided to co-ordinate their efforts to buy their way out of the economic downturn that is coming, it is another indication that there is a bad moon rising.\n\nThe Q\u2019s have been resistant to even falling at all, since tech people can work from home. Well, how much can you sell, when people are out of work? SPY has been taking a hit because everyone is worried about a disruption for not more than 2Qs and RUT has been leading the way down, because small businesses are shit.\n\nI thought, like you did, that that little bump up around March 3rd was the bull trap. I now think there is a much bigger bump coming that will be the real bull trap. If we\u2019re truly 2 weeks behind Italy, this was the first day they saw a decrease in the growth rate of infected. So, in order to keep ahead of the market, we\u2019ve got a couple days to make the next trade. Everyone is anticipating that 2 weeks from now we\u2019ll see a decrease in the growth rate of the virus. Which means people are going to be buying. **Sell your puts expiring before, IDK Sept**. \n\nThe trade(s):\n\nTrump himself told us we should be good in July/August. With how quickly the market is moving, I am sure the bull buy programs will go into effect quickly. After all, we know when it will end, so why not stock up before then. Tomorrow may be a battle between bulls/bears. The moment the RUT hits 975, the Q\u2019s hit 156, or SPY hits who the fuck knows, which may be tomorrow, I\u2019m switching from a bear to a bull.\n\nOn the other hand, I am looking at a catchup trade for year end after this little bull spurt. Qs to hit 2013 levels (about where RUT will be at the Monthly Moving Average).  So, looking for the most profitable strikes for the Q\u2019s to hit mid 60\u2019s, SPY to hit 160.\n\nCurrent near expiring positions: SQQQ\u2019s 100 $30CMar20 and 30 $25CJun19, some LVS Jun 35P, CPB $36 May 15P. I also sold 10 CCL 12.50 Puts for 4/17, and have a ton of $5 and 5.50 GME calls, that you can see in my post history (and those gonna climb before Friday). \n\nCall me out on it and I\u2019ll provide a screenshot, but does it really make sense for someone to tell you what he\u2019s already got, when you want proof where he\u2019s going to go. Seems like a great way to get scammed.\n\nSelling it all tomorrow (except for the GME)", "created_utc": 1584426613.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fk0hgq/speculation/", "is_self": true}
