{"id": "fjbiyq", "title": "Achieving Full Autist Form", "selftext": "Let\u2019s start with a little background to begin for the 3 people that have the attention span to read more than a sentence. \n\nStarted watching this subreddit when a friend informed me of it in January. At that point, I was a normal college finance manager that abided by the \u201cbuy and hold\u201d strategy taught to me by the boomer professors. Then this reddit started to change me. Shortly there after I did my first options trade. It happened to be due to the DD of a now banned user on $LL. Bought 1k worth of calls on margin and ended up selling for 2k a little over a week later. \n\nNow I had a choice, do I take my gains or say fuck it and go back in. Well I\u2019m still here so I bet you can guess what I chose. I started playing $SPCE puts and made it up to 3.4k as of yesterday. That\u2019s when I really started to go for it. I plunged that 3.4k straight into $CCL 15.00 and 17.50 puts dated April 17th as well as a $DIS 85.00 put for the April 17th. \n\nAt this point I was chilling, I knew that whatever happened with this money would be ok since I basically was playing with no real investment from myself anyways. But then today happens. The market is up all day but I hold off till about 2 pm EST, at this point I really felt the autist waves coming over me. So I go ahead and buy 3 $DAL 30.00 puts for April 17th as well as 2 $SPY 230.00 puts also on April 17th. Still not full autist but it did take me back to being 3k in the margin. \n\nThen the power hour happens...\n\nThis is when full form is achieved. I see that my SPY puts are already down 50% and am faced with yet another choice...\n\nI end up buying 3 more SPY 230.00 puts for April 17th at pretty much there low for the day which helped bring my cost basis down significantly, but also puts me at a 5k margin. \n\nSo there you have it. This is the story of how this subreddit created a autist our of a finance major with boomer tendencies in under two months. Hope the 3 people that made it this far enjoyed the story.\n\nCan anyone tell me how fucked I am?\n\nTLDR: this subreddit will turn a rational investor into a full fledged autist in under two months. \n\nWill post current positions if you would like a visual", "created_utc": 1584317641.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjbiyq/achieving_full_autist_form/", "is_self": true}
