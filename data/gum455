Jerry Hill, D-San Mateo, is carrying legislation that could make the utility subsidiary Pacific Gas and Electric Co. owned by a new nonprofit public benefit corporation called Golden State Energy. But it would only happen if the PG&E\u2019s bankruptcy implodes or state regulators take the drastic step of revoking the company\u2019s operating license.\n\nWhile the bar for such a revocation is high, it is an option that the California Public Utilities Commission enshrined in a new enforcement process when it [approved PG&E\u2019s bankruptcy reorganization plan Thursday.](https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Regulators-OK-PG-E-s-bankruptcy-plan-despite-15301790.php) Regulators at the commission could reconsider the license if the company causes more disasters and other enforcement measures prove insufficient.\"\n\nNow, I'm no expert, but this doesn't sound like it's very encouraging to shareholders, and even less encouraging to options addicted autists. Are there still hopes for printing tendies with the government putting such a damper on capitalism?\n\nPCG 9/18 20c and shares\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Including article link cause I'm retarded and forgot to do it in the first place.", "created_utc": 1591023556.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gum455/for_my_fellow_pcg_bagholding_autists/", "is_self": true}
