{"id": "hbuhsq", "title": "VERI - AI play jumped 44% after announcing agreement with \"influencer\" network", "selftext": "Came to my attention today, so...later than I'd like to get the info, but maybe something worth looking into. Vertione is an artifical intelligence company specializing in advertising and content licensing. Collab is a comapny that helps coordinate influencers and brands, facilitating them making money and making even more in the process. The thought process behind the two working together is likely algorithmic streamlining of an advertising fuckfest designed to get gen-z to spend their parents money as effectively as possible..and also license the fuck out of everything these \"influencers\" do for max tendies. Could be hugely profitable for this AI company that would otherwise...not really ever get much spotlight.\n\nCurrently sitting at basically its 52w high since year of IPO, but I'm not seeing it mentioned much and there could be room to run. Only read up on it after hours so no positions yet, but I'll look to buying in (yes theres options). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNasdaq link announcing agreement with Collab:\n\n[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stock-alert%3A-veritone-shares-up-on-association-with-collab-2020-06-16](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stock-alert%3A-veritone-shares-up-on-association-with-collab-2020-06-16)", "created_utc": 1592542832.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hbuhsq/veri_ai_play_jumped_44_after_announcing_agreement/", "is_self": true}
