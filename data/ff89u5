{"id": "ff89u5", "title": "Shorting Wendy's", "selftext": "They have a greater than 700% debt-to-equity ratio (compared to 4.35% for McDonalds and 280% for Burger King's owner Restaurant Brands). Their cash to debt ratio is only 8% (meaning they couldn't pay debt off with cash on hand), they have a forward p/e ratio of 30.5 (compared to 23.47 for MCD & 14.31 for Restaurant Brands). They're priced like large growth is expected, and I don't see any reason Wendy's is expected to grow quickly.\n\n50% of their customers are over 45; almost 40% over 50.\n\nIf a single case of COVID-19 is ever associated with a single Wendy's, they could see a large drop in revenue. Their financial situation does not make it easy for them to endure a negative bump in revenue. So far, the fast food industry is not one of those any government is considering for targeted aid.\n\nIf they risk defaulting; this could be a huge opportunity for their competitors.\n\nWEN 15 May Put $16", "created_utc": 1583646131.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ff89u5/shorting_wendys/", "is_self": true}
