{"id": "bouuy3", "title": "Urban Trade Breakdowns - The Dotcom Bubble", "selftext": "What the fuck happened on March 11th, 2000? Well, that\u2019s something you may or may not ever know.  You may read on, in which case you will get my spin on this. But you may also think, fuck, I don\u2019t have the patience for this fucking dude again, and click ahead to something with pictures, or head back to pornhub.   But no matter what you do, odds are it was entirely predictable.  Because if you can fix the context, human behavior is totally predictable.  Put a few monkeys in a cage and fuck with them long enough, and you will quickly learn with near certainty how they will respond.  And we evolved from those motherfuckers.  But I get ahead of myself.\n\nMarch 11, 2000 was the day the Nasdaq first hit 5,132.52 marking the height of the dotcom bubble. Now, I know Nasdaq 5132.52 may seem kinda quaint to all you easy-money loving QE crack whores, but at the time, that was some lofty shit.  And the thing is, it was no overnight bubble.  A decade before the dotcom top, between 1991 and 1996, the Nasdaq rose roughly 108%.  That\u2019s one fuck of a five-year return.  So much so, that in December of 1996, then Fed Chair Alan Greenspan, after unleashing the 1.0 version of his University of Chicago easy money economic Frankenstein on the global economy, thinks, \u2018my god, what have I done?\u2019 and endeavored to talk the markets down with talk of \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d and other such Fed speak.  But no one ever understood Greenspan\u2019s English (read his shit - good luck).  And in the four years that followed, the Nasdaq rose another 300%.  By 3/11/2000, the Nasdaq PE was 200.  Today it trades around 29.  Imagine MU at 2176 (200X FY19 EPS).  That\u2019s how shit was then.  Fuck.\n\nBut bubble-wise, this was an interesting one.  Looking back, you\u2019d be hard pressed to find the Jessie Livermore or Michael Burry of the time.  Sure, there were guys like Mark Cuban, who sold a whole lot of bullshit to Yahoo in 1999 for $6.8B, and then diversified his ass outa dodge, dumping the Yahoo funny money fast and buying a basketball team and making his name in network television.  But that\u2019s a sale and not a trade.  So what else?  No doubt Chanos totally nailed Enron, but I covered that already.  Sir John Templeton?  He went short and pretty much called the top and made about $80m.  But historically speaking, that\u2019s a yolo yawn.  We can aim higher.  \n\nSo what exactly crashed the party on March 11, 2000?  Where is the LTCM or Thai currency crises or Lehman Brothers of 2000?  Well that\u2019s the wrong question.  The invention of the Internet, the shit that started it all, was no kinda Tulip or Wall Street fraud.  It was the real deal and to bet against it at the time was just fucking stupid.  Yeah the momentum was irresistible but so too were the fundamentals.  In 1995 there were roughly 44m Internet users, which grew to 350m by 2000.  Today there are 4.3B. In 1995 there were less than 1m internet users in China. Today it\u2019s estimated to be over 1B.  That\u2019s 1000x growth and the shit has gone parabolic ever since.  Oh, and the iPhone and mobile Internet? Well that was still seven years in the future.\n\nAnd as silly as all the profitless Mary Meeker new economy eyeball financial metrics of the day may seem in hindsight, the traditional definition of the business cycle seemed equally inept in the face of a global technological and social transformation of the scale, but that\u2019s what crashed the party.  It\u2019s kinda that simple.  The business cycle that ran its course and even the long-game has it\u2019s limit.  And at that point, no money, no honey.  When the IPOs tapered off and the unicorns of the day, with no hope of future profitability (Webvan, Thegkobe) started to collapse, you could hear the checkbooks closing from Sandhill Road to Wall Street.  The end.  \n\nWell, actually, no.\n\nIt was more like the beginning, and here\u2019s where the trade comes in.  In the first paragraph I got all haughty and shit and said your next move was predictable.  That\u2019s true.  But what started during the dotcom bubble was an economic model and an unprecedented wave of technology innovation funded by easy bubble money, which ultimately lead to the the mother of all trades: the trading of you.  Whether you have read this far or not, deep in one or more nondescript cold-ass data-centers somewhere, a record of your activity will be added to your file.  And amidst all this raised-floor white noise and cheap Chinese hardware, your file is combined with billions of other files and fed through black-box super-intelligent algorithms programmed to predict your next move, the result of which is auctioned off at light-speed and in real-time to the highest bidder.  And the winner gets to chose what you see next, carefully placed in an auto-fill browser window or search result or news-feed.  And over time, as the shit gets smarter and smarter, your monkey-ass is captured (that\u2019s actually the word), app-by-app, login-by-login.  And if Nasdaq 5132.52 seems quint today, it\u2019s because the Nasdaq is pretty fucking quint compared to the hundred of billions traded on your next move.  But as cool as all this is, if an algo can predict your next move and auction that shit in real time to the next bidder, someone should really think about pointing that shit at equity markets, right?\n\nThe end.", "created_utc": 1557905456, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bouuy3/urban_trade_breakdowns_the_dotcom_bubble/", "is_self": true}
