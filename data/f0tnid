{"id": "f0tnid", "title": "Cruise lines are the new offshore drillers", "selftext": "Friday I bought 30 puts on CCL (Carnival Cruises) for April expiration at $42.50 strike.   The stonk was trading around $42.50.  I sold them later in the day for a $1,000 profit (weak hands, yeah yeah) but pondering it more this weekend I think they and other cruise lines are in deep water this year.\n\nDo you know anyone right now who would book a cruise?  I sure don't.   CCL has 10 billion in debt and will have ships just sitting there gathering dust and fees.\n\nCCL pays a big fat dividend.   Seadrill paid a huge dividend when it was $30 a share (something like 7% IIRC).   Look at how far they fell.  Different industry, but it shows what happens with debt and unused boats.\n\nI am strongly thinking of buying the 30 puts again on Monday...especially if there is some kind of pop.", "created_utc": 1581178571, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f0tnid/cruise_lines_are_the_new_offshore_drillers/", "is_self": true}
