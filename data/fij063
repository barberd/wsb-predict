But since my portfolio grew about 1000% in 16 days thanks to WSB, I figured I could as well share it with you guys.\n\nThe following is a very shitty modeling of the number of infected people in the US based on two sources that you could've done in 5 minutes if you weren't lazy. It's not very different from all the other calculations, but it's been updated with the latest data and uses metrics from Western countries.\n\nFor extreme simplicity (I know you retards won't read the rest):  \n22% growth daily ~ Italy after quarantine  \n35% growth daily ~ Italy before quarantine\n\n#[THIS IS WHERE YOU CLICK](https://i.imgur.com/HDLTlip.png)\n\n---\n\n#A few things to keep in mind:\n\n- the number of infections later on is obviously bullshit, the US will take extreme measures far before it reaches 125 million infections\n- Italy has some seriously good healthcare, 40% of you guys can't even afford a fucking dental checkup\n- all this is assuming the US won't use extreme draconian China-like measures. Anyway, if they do, $SPY goes to shit anyway, so it's a win-win situation\n- all this is assuming we won't be seeing a vaccine/treatment soon (so keep an eye on Remdesivir or Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine, which Poland started using as official treatment yesterday and southeastern Asian countries have been using it for quite a while)\n- I am European and I don't even have a high school degree; feel free to insult\n- the virus is VERY context/culture dependent, the numbers are VERY different in various countries - thus the data I present you is based on Western culture (Western Europe) - for example, Taiwan (where everyone wears masks because they cost 20 cents) has only 50 confirmed cases/1 death and they are literally part of China /s\n- (the measures Taiwan had to take very early on to get these insanely good numbers are [here](https://cdn.jamanetwork.com/ama/content_public/journal/jama/0/jvp200035supp1_prod.pdf?Expires=2147483647&Signature=bIZCLS7ZLWTJd%7EU%7EH40JgiEGdFb3ggVUJpBvJ7KdANK7HgK1zaj4uWHvqweGym1nWfO%7EnXt9Y5i1vX79pF7zjjqfzmJAy3udTdpVVZQe07xnQIPcBMXLwZ5XjgTO8yKFXVIpxsXhrmOu8sGSpKiEmQ86ZCKfOTar7fMAGmUCtjiYVFwf31K3REWAA-r3hZyoZpqz3QKpVgpsRpF9fV9thQCq0%7EyvbvRKTH4PcoB%7ECZgmXH7rpVb6bILXQn5zBCphf6pyLAa4zIebUEKfCdCYdSdi9LeIEUsesqsYpNWgHJcr4K1LC0hFlst0RHQz-vZ7I-OvrX%7E5jel6zjjtuDQzjQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA) or twitter mirror [here](https://twitter.com/eric_khun/status/1238302647620255745?s=3))\n- there is obviously a number of other macroeconomic factors: the price of oil; the fact that it's election year in the US (keep that in mind when considering Trump's actions); rising Middle East tensions; possible growth of loan defaults/bank failures/financial crisis\n\n#Data sources:\n\n- the starting data is taken from an unofficial source, because the CDC is always at least 1 day behind. The CDC currently reports 1629 cases (number from Thursday 4pm), my source reports 2333 as of today (Saturday) - the CDC usually catches up to this site in a day: https://coronavirus.1point3acres.com/en\n- the growth data (either 0.22 or 0.35 per day) is taken from this fella here: http://nrg.cs.ucl.ac.uk/mjh/covid19/ \n- it was previously speculated that the numbers double in 3-4 days; 22-35% daily seems to be the most accurate data we have from Western countries (35% is the early Italy/current Spain scenario, 22% is the late Italy scenario with all the serious measures)\n- I used two starting numbers for today (Saturday), 2333 and 4666, because I strongly believe that due to a lack of testing in the US, 2333 is a grossly underestimated number\n\n---\n\n#Links to visit if you're bored because the market is closed during the weekend:\n\nallegedly the \"worlds best expert on the virus\" saying \"we r fukd\" https://old.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ffuetd/leading_german_virologist_summer_will_decrease_r0/\n\nhow to make bread https://www.crazyforcrust.com/easy-white-bread/\n\ncovid19 estimated CFR vs time https://imgur.com/gallery/biPYThH\n\nanother gay wsb modeling https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fgl8sj/covid_19_modeling_possible_inflection_points/\n\ncool infection rate sheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jj-IgWzm8SNQcNJdangEYg63_37S-eDYaXIa8E3DLkc/edit#gid=0\n\ntop20 countries death rates https://old.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/fhhhgd/covid19_death_rates_per_country_for_the_top_20/\n\nrandom links on chloroquine I copied from /r/covid19  \nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/fhu7lj/of_chloroquine_and_covid19_critical_commentary_in/  \nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/fh5064/a_systematic_review_on_the_efficacy_and_safety_of/  \nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/fgm3xq/in_vitro_antiviral_activity_and_projection_of/  \nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/ffztou/expert_chloroquine_phosphate_has_a_negative_time/  \nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fi8eox/poland_has_formally_registered_chloroquine_as_a/\n\n\n\n---\n\n#My current positions:  \n\nUS options: 4x $DB Jul17 5p, 1x $DIS Mar20 91p, 1x $HLT Mar20 70p, 1x $SIX Jun19 15p, 2x $WH Mar20 40p\n\nFrankfurt warrants: 1050x S&P500 April17 2550p, 900x S&P500 April17 2300p, 500x $DIS Jun19 84p, 500x $DIS Jun19 98p, 500x Volkswagen VZ Mar20 115p, 400x DAX Mar27 9000p, 50x $AMD Dec18 70call (lol)\n\n---\n\n#TL;DR if you're autistic enough not to notice the TL;DR at the very top\n\n$SPY 230p april17 2020  \nor VIX/VIX derivatives calls, but I don't know how that works, so hopefully someone in the comments will share a play on volatility", "created_utc": 1584195398.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fij063/why_i_hope_youre_jacked_to_the_tits_with_spy_puts/", "is_self": true}
