The framework behind it is second to none and third-generation is going to take off. \n\nI\u2019m 2k in on CDF\u2019s for A.D.A @ 20,110 units so if this hits a dollar I\u2019m rich. It\u2019s currently 0.08 a unit so instead of wasting your money on stupendous SPY calls and puts why not leverage trade A.D.A and get these gains really happening.\n\nI calculated that if all 1.3m degenerates in this subreddit put at least $1000 in to  A.d.a that would Equal $1B more marketcap therefore pumping the price. It\u2019s time everyone to go all in, 100% down in A.D.A before July 31st\n\nYOLO LETS GET THAT LAMBO CUZ DADDY NEED A NEW PAIR OF SHOES", "created_utc": 1593412004.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hhur9v/2k_all_in_surely_better_than_a_casino/", "is_self": true}
