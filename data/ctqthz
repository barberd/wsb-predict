At this point I have never invested before or knew how the market worked. I was doing some research and I felt the best way to spend it was to invest. I picked AMD. A shaky stock for most of its life. I knew it was risky but I said what the hell. I went all into AMD at 17.23 and bought 116 shares. The main reason why I picked it was not because of the new product lineup this year ( I didn\u2019t even know anything coming out this year to be honest ) but because of the fact I just built a new PC with a AMD CPU and I knew the products were quality. I did not realize that Ryzen 3, new gpus, and EYPC 2 was launching. These are all huge products for the company and have taken significant marketshare from Intel and soon the server sector too. Over the months. I have bought 20 more shares each before each product launch. Through the past 8-9 months I have learned so much about the market and how it works. Im still learning which is amazing. I am so lucky for picking this great stock by my gut feeling. I have made close to 3,000. Almost double the total money I have invested. Thanks for reading and may the markets be on your side.", "created_utc": 1566439424, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ctqthz/i_sat_down_with_2000_in_january/", "is_self": true}
