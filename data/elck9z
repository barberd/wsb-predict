Thank \"god\"!", "selftext": "Intel succesfully dominated the cpu market the past years but clearly missed and intentionally ignored many factors lately.\n\nNvidia is even worse in my opinion. Keeping prices high, relaxing &amp; resting on there wide spreaded established \"monopolistic\" state (CUDA, software &amp; gaming industries favoured optimisations, etc)\n\nAs Intel has profited from the same prefered optimisations the past years!\n\nBefore trolling or flaming me, let me state that I am neither an Intel, or Nvidia, nor AMD fanboy.\n\nIntel and Nvidia have drained our money for far too long.\n\nI wish there were more CPU and GPU manufacturers, it would make the market situation much more interesting and perhaps (likely) more consumer friendly (price/performance ratio, etc)\n\nI wont go too deep now, we are living in am absolut capitalist driven age. More, Faster, Instant!\n\nI really hope Intel and Nvidia get crushed by AMD for a awhile to teach them, that you can't just be supreme money drainer, that forgot that without us consumers, that trust and buy their hardware, are the ones that made it possible!\n\nFUCK YOU INDUSTRY!
