{"id": "f0ezwb", "title": "MSFT or GTFO", "selftext": "Can you actually imagine there are people in WSB that aren\u2019t buying MSFT calls? Who the fuck do you think you are? Do you think you know something we don\u2019t? Do you think you\u2019re fucking special? This can\u2019t go tits up. \n\nI just read an article on the onion and found out that buying MSFT RIGHT NOW is like buying Amazon at 10 dollars and that stock is at 2,000. If my math is correct that means MSFT is hitting at least 1,000 by end of March.\n\nI just don\u2019t fucking get it. Don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t try to give you some advice. \n\nAnyways, SPCE to 25 by 2/29.\n\nTendies - https://imgur.com/gallery/UVh6Pln", "created_utc": 1581101772, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f0ezwb/msft_or_gtfo/", "is_self": true}
