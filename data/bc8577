I am not interested in debates about \"why\" in this thread (happy to discuss elsewhere) I am only looking for input on \"how.\" \n\nI currently have bear put spreads with expiries timed to include Q1 - Q3 filings, respectively. I also have a bear call spread for Q3. \n\nI use TDA and when i tried to sell the stock short traditionally a few months ago their response was that there was no TSLA shares available in the stock loan system (I called them to verify). Then I went short via options. \n\nTSLA options are expensive. Is there a less risky way to buy a lotto ticket that they file for bankruptcy by the end of 2020? Credit default swaps? Can retail investors even access those instruments (I'm not an accredited investor). For reference, 15 JAN 21 puts are $71 per strike as of now. $190 puts with same expiration are $35.", "created_utc": 1555034137, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bc8577/tsla_shorting_mechanisms/", "is_self": true}
