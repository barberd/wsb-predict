{"id": "bjharx", "title": "Tesla, Tesla, Tesla and Tesla", "selftext": "So I've been watching youtube videos about Tesla and now half my YT feed is about Tesla.\n\nSo now I'm just wondering how it's possible that a high marketcap company can be so extremely undervalued, how can the market be this irrational, clearly this should be at least $1000 a share, maybe even $5000. It truly is a miracle to me that such a famous company can be so undervalued. Their brand is doing amazing, they're selling every car they produce, their partners are making half the world's lithium batteries in Tesla's factories, governments are literally giving their subjects money to buy EVs, stupid green hype gets companies to buy stupid purchases to appear green like that expensive Semi or whatever. Tesla already survived the risky parts and bankruptcy isn't close anymore.\n\nWhy are people shorting this stock?! it doesn't make sense to me, the upside is enormous and the downside is miniscule considering they can so easily raise capital whenever necessary. They might even become Uber's biggest competitor in the future and oh they're are also gonna sell solar roofs or something, it's crazy how much this company is going to grow.\n\nThe only thing that I can imagine, is that I'm missing an important detail, missing something hidden, but what could that be?", "created_utc": 1556718665, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bjharx/tesla_tesla_tesla_and_tesla/", "is_self": true}
