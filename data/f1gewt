{"id": "f1gewt", "title": "$MSFT to $190-$200 by March? DD + YOLO + Stats inside: ~$30k to $230k", "selftext": "Your favorite $MSFT shill is back for round three.\n\n**Azure is increasingly being recognized for the driver it is and Microsoft is quickly shedding its reputation for being a Windows company.**\n\nYou can't go far now without hearing that Azure Clouds (IaaS/PaaS), Office 365 Clouds (SaaS), and Dynamics (SaaS) are the absolute focus for the company. Windows, Xbox, and hardware are just funnels into Azure, Azure services, and data-collection endpoints that provide telemetry to improving the underlying technology fabric of the shared Windows and Windows Server codebase that help to power much of Azure outside of Linux. Speaking of Linux, with half of Azure compute workloads being Linux, Microsoft has equal motivation to &lt;3 it. As far as the market is concerned, Windows is just a reliable cash flow. As far as data is considered, it's going to be a goldmine for a long time.\n\nMy hypothesis is that as $MSFT is increasingly valued as a cloud services company, and less as a traditional software company and hardware provider, the P/E ratio premium will increase. What investor doesn't love reliable, enterprise, high gross margin cash that just keeps coming? The most recent earnings was the best in history, and there is no indication anywhere that trend is going to change. IT spend on cloud is only going to increase.\n\n**Azure has only increasing momentum, recognition by various industries as a preferred option over AWS, and differentiation that is both gaining on AWS and overcoming it as a market leader.**\n\nThe momentum of Azure at this point is simply undeniable. As the current cohort of hyperscale cloud incumbents continue to drop like flies in IaaS (the largest source of revenue for cloud platforms today),  that momentum will accelerate. $GOOG (the only other actual competition left) is not going to make it in the enterprise with their recent loss of trust from the leak on backing off cloud and data harvesting, Red Hat and OpenShift won't be enough to save $IBM and it's paltry existence, and $BABA won't make further inroads to Western markets, limiting itself to China and SEA. Multi-cloud / poly-cloud implementations won't save them, either, as $MSFT and $AMZN establish their moats. No business idolizes needing to train two different ways of doing the same things, so they will tend to lean on a primary provider. We are talking a $92bn global market by 2023 with a 25% CAGR, and that is before we even get to PaaS, where $MSFT is a clear leader.

That isn't going anywhere.\n\nIndustries from healthcare (Microsoft is ranked as a leader above Amazon in health cloud tech) and retail will bleed off from $AMZN and shift to Azure. $AMZN may have had first-mover advantage, but $MSFT has far greater trust from CIOs/CTOs. One of their primary concerns for Azure, reliability, is quickly diminishing as $MSFT makes increased investments to increasing reliability. Azure CTO Mark Russinovich has established it as one of the highest priorities to achieving parity and then superiority to $AMZN.

The reputation difference when it comes to AWS vs. Azure on hybrid is clear, and $MSFT has a massive advantage with Azure Stack, Azure Edge, Azure Sphere, and more.\n\nAWS Outpost and Snowball alone can't match the functional capabilities of the Azure Stack family which has a multi-year head start and can operate completely disconnected.\n\n**Azure** ***already*** **has leadership in IoT and Microsoft will help take the lead in 5G this year with AT&amp;T and the US intention to curve Huawei.**\n\nThe one-two punch of IoT and 5G leadership will open up incredible new opportunities. Are you betting big on a connected world? Bet on Microsoft.
