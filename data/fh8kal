{"id": "fh8kal", "title": "I'm going to be rich from my YOLO!", "selftext": "So today about 10 minutes before closing I see the market going up and read something about Trump speaking on stimulus tonight on national TV and my hands get weak and I sell all my 3/27/2020 270 SPY puts for 11.50 each. After selling I remember reading a post from some Autist on here about the last 15m candle being green and the next day being red, as well as remembering that Trump is a joke and can't manage his way out of a wet paper bag and decide to YOLO it and re buy my puts and hold through his speech. I rebuy at the same price, 11.50, only I buy 1 extra (26 where as I sold 25). I figure if my ROTH IRA is gonna go down I might as well go up, and if I loose all this 30k, then my IRA will have gone up, so win win, right? Tomorrow, I'm going to be rich\n\nTL;DR sold and re bought my 3/27 270p SPY right before market close, and now tomorrow is going to be a bloodbath. Where should I donate to when I make a killing?\n\nEdit: sorry for not posting proof, schwab wouldn't let me screen grab from my phone, something about security settings. here is proof: https://imgur.com/gallery/L3nfm4p\n\nP.S the 27th is my birthday, which is why I chose those puts.", "created_utc": 1583977393.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fh8kal/im_going_to_be_rich_from_my_yolo/", "is_self": true}
