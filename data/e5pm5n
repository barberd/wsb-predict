But millennial social justice warriors are not the primary consumer of $3000 exercise bikes...and frankly if you look at fashion/instagram culture today, women are BEGGING to be treated like little pets *and don\u2019t even know it*. \n\nEnter Peloton. This Christmas, get her the human hamster wheel neither of you even knew you wanted.", "created_utc": 1575414953, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e5pm5n/peloton_is_the_ipo_wsb_didnt_know_it_needed/", "is_self": true}
