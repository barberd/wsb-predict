This, on top of its rapidly growing developer platform, is consequential for many reasons as a market-mover in the industry. Theyre going to be printing a lot of money at a steady pace for a very long time and I thought you guys should know since you're all so desperate and pathetic right now for something good.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# # In Short\n\nCloudFlare so far has been shredding forward across multiple technical markets competing against by:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Competing marketshare against CISCO, Palo Alto Networks, and other hardware customers\n* Offering a way to not lock your organization into a big tech vendor\n* Promoting security and challenging Big Tech's direction with web development\n* Forming positive relationships with Shopify, Facebook, JD, Twitter, Baidu, TOR, and Microsoft\n* Pioneering the ease-of-use privacy movement with [1.1.1.1](https://1.1.1.1) and distributing VPNs.\n* Growing a rapid, robust, cost-effective, and secure network across the world\n* *Providing a development platform that promotes the use extremely powerful and 'cutting edge' web computing.* \\-> **YOU ARE HERE**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Creating a better internet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[This is the fucking Co-Founder of NPM who pioneered streaming technology en masse for developers.](https://preview.redd.it/zon44fsapk451.png?width=1204&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1838127869af81ba9ff2fcaa50f4b8e2028af51)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# # The Thesis\n\nThe economic value and convergence between e-commerce, global networking speeds, and video advancements is not anywhere close to realized. There has been an acceleration toward this reality but it's still early in the overall economic development cycle. This timeframe has been accelerated greatly due to global market lockdowns and further risk of lockdown.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPhysical and monetary assets being virtualized has recently been accelerated in importance and this will have positive effects, across time, on businesses that focus on securing those assets in its time spent delivering on multiple ultra-high-speed networks across the world. Computing is getting cheaper and easier to distribute in rather extreme ways and the execution of these ideas is happening right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The network has enormous inherent value. Just look at Akamai's stock history for example. This data has been \\\\\"crunched\\\\\". 2-5 years accelerated in 1.](https://preview.redd.it/8fhkpr6cpk451.png?width=696&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e2d6301242fd7526116a116cd27bb0d101d6bc4)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInfrastructure that support these interactive ecosystems will be growing at incredible rates. This market is **\\*\\*BIG\\*\\*** and no one or two players will be large enough to capture the market. It ranges from manufacturers, energy departments, web products, hospitals, governments, and so on. Security is serviced differently based on the industry. This much is obvious - a hospital will clearly protect patient records more closely than a manufacturer controlling the runtime of their high-speed machining assembly line.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Z-Scaler makes bank off manufacturing and supply chain operations](https://preview.redd.it/xzj23zndpk451.png?width=1880&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e5e7aad5ede4a438f5eeffad6c4bfb1f8ae363b)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Cloudflare prioritizes hospitals and offers a lot of good shit for very little.](https://preview.redd.it/jcusezeepk451.png?width=1912&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5a66a435eb01690854f53eb3b63c5ca3a332100)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Amazon and FB obvious target web retailers more](https://preview.redd.it/bws0ruafpk451.png?width=1926&format=png&auto=webp&s=22bf2d5ac9eb01d871f16cdee3f25bb3a1c28946)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Fastly targets fast media and video processing.

Around this time you also began to see new products in ESports like [Twitch.tv](https://Twitch.tv) which would \"stream\" video.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat had happened was that tech companies discovered a more cost effective way of delivering video and it was through controlling the actual pipeline. You would receive atomized content as needed rather than waiting for blocks of video to be received on your end (this was problematic in early Youtube days with broadband and DSL)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe paradigm began to shift. Cloud computing and asynchronous models began to gain steam in the developer profession. We began a defining chapter of web optimizations that still continue today with serverless computing, real-time data, and growing user-experiences. At this time you began to notice that you no longer had to refresh your web page to receive new data. Remember when Facebook started to notify you rather than you checking your notifications? Do you remember when you had to check your email?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToday, developers are able to create or distribute product and services using networking and data center functions. This is largely what is recognized as cloud and serverless computing. This is has many consequences but primarily allows for unbelievably fast responses and avenues for user experiences.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[A solo developer can have a student upload a meme for an assignment, have that image analyzed for text, and automatically answer the question if it was right.](https://preview.redd.it/a645yz1jpk451.png?width=1626&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0ce37c55836f08c86b95a5dec4150f247b7d175)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# # What is serverless computing?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nServerless computing allows a 25 year old developer like me run 5 different businesses on my dinky little Macintosh while I let Google and Cloudflare run my servers under an extremely cheap pricing model. That is a revolutionary change for software. It is one of the bread and butter of SaaS, IaaS, and other cloud style businesses where many business problems come out of the box for you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Out of the box business solutions.](https://preview.redd.it/7qq6h6ujpk451.png?width=1330&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0bf6314cf4c937427ff4011c3891eebc11477b4)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# # Other competitive advantages of network and cloud computing\n\nThe reason Snapchat did not gain any traction outside of the US was because Facebook provided a fundamentally faster service across WhatsApp and Instagram. Facebook's investment in Akamai and its personal networking infrastructure allowed them to create a product that was fast, cheap and would work in various rural or economic conditions. Snapchat never stood a chance in the global social media landscape as a result.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Deep investments in infrastructure means DEEP growth](https://preview.redd.it/svayplokpk451.png?width=1866&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bcc17951f303841dcaaa13f54063f927efd7dac)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# # What's special about CloudFlare as a network?\n\nWhat CloudFlare specifically offers against its competitors is its ***\\*\\*privacy-first approach\\*\\**** and its quality of engineering. CloudFlare is essentially a distributed private content delivery network (pCDN) with a massive infrastructure effort to send data around the world safely and cheaply.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is fundamentally consequential as we are seeing massive nations tackle issues with how data can be utilized or privatized.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Extremely high quality engineering = less costs = more market capture](https://preview.redd.it/pu4xoq3mpk451.png?width=1624&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b4217b2bad4ffa80c00439499b00c79c420b77b)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Good relationships with enterprise = money city.
