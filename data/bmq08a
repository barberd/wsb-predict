They beat estimates. Stock tanks. I lose.\n\nSecond: Had calls on DIS ER. They Beat and had great guidance. Next day tanks. I lose.\n\nThird: I decide to switch it up and go against the ER. Have puts on GPRO, they beat estimates, stock moons. I lose. \n\nIt's been fun, folks, but my ass is raw from getting pounded. I will go ahead and retire my autistic ways and just watch on the sidelines.\n\nTotal loss $12k. Money in account tomorrow $0.69.\n\nGodspeed faggots, godspeed.", "created_utc": 1557439543, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bmq08a/earnings_report_gambles/", "is_self": true}
