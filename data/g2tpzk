{"id": "g2tpzk", "title": "V shaped recovery for part of the market, L shaped for the other parts (put holders on SPY should close their positions)", "selftext": "A few days ago, someone posted about how SPY is made up primarily of tech and healthcare, and I think that is pretty much the basis of this post.\n\nThis week has been a fantastic microcosm of what is going on in the market.\n\nWe've seen today that any news of recovery or news of opening the country rallies the market incrementally (drug release and plan for opening today). \n\nLikewise, we've also seen that banks earnings are all rotten, and banks have gone down the entire week. Look at JPM for an example, every single day it went down with each release of earnings from its competitors in the banking sector. (same can be said about oil)\n\ndespite banking and oil going down all this week, SPY has been going up. Why?\n\nIt's because SPY has a majority composition of companies that benefit from the crisis and are in a V shaped recovery. There is a minority of companies that are in an L shaped recovery.\n\nWhat's the takeaway? FED goes brr, and that has helped get us to this point, but that's not helping banks or oil this week, so it shouldn't be helping tech & healthcare either, yet tech & healthcare are still up this week. In other words, what matters is whether or not a company is well positioned in this particular crisis.\n\ntl;dr \n\nClose your puts spy holders, you're fucked otherwise. People that use TA on SPY in this crisis without going into analyze SPY's holdings are retarded, or are trying to get your attention for their own benefit\n\npositions: QQQ, VXUS, xom, walmart, square, BRK.B, tencent, luckin coffee", "created_utc": 1587092512.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2tpzk/v_shaped_recovery_for_part_of_the_market_l_shaped/", "is_self": true}
