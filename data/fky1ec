DO NOT LET IT GET TO YOUR HEAD. \n\nI caught a few earnings coin flips around 2010-2012 and let it make me feel like I was really great at this game.\n\nI ended up giving all my gains and a lot more - summing to over 400k-500k(who can keep track of continuous losses) ended up homeless and a lot of card debt bad student loans, and am finally just getting back on my feet again after almost 10 years.\n\nDO NOT LET IT GET TO YOU.
