Of course the one time I figure out a trend it does not happen. We all saw those posts with the arrows and the friday spikes. But as a good investor knows previous trends and stock prices do not have to continue and may stop at any time. So from now on I will be sure to do more of my own DD, do some research on bear markets. And buy SPY puts, buy SPY puts, buy SPY puts, buy SPY puts so I can buy more buy SPY puts. Since from all the bad news we are seeing I think spy 100 may be possible.\n\nAnd no I didn't really expect SPY to hit 293 they were just cheap one dollar options that if had gone up only 5 cents during a spike would have made profit. Expecting SPY to hit 293 isn't just retarded its insane. I'm just glad I had the restraint to not full yolo and sell all my positions to ride the witch broom that never came instead there was just a smiling bear with a rather large red dildo. Elon save me.\n\nSide note: Tesla gonna crash right like sub 300 right? Also lots of people are talking about banks collapsing how do I profit, which tickers?\n\nTL;DR: Witches suck buy puts like this one SPY 210 4/17", "created_utc": 1584741724.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fm3ovp/down_since_fucked_by_witches_but_not_out/", "is_self": true}
