I see too much ignorance all over this sub, and I need you to get smart. The key to our success in these trying times will be a victoey against the Rona. I\u2019m here to tell you the REAL DEAL about what\u2019s going on so far. Strap in and get ready to get educated.\n\nFirst: some Rona infection news. We\u2019re seeing some crazy ass symptoms in people that we didn\u2019t link to the Rona before recently. Take that actor who needed his leg amputated and has reportedly gone downhill in his conditions in the past 24 hours. He had blood clotting induced by Covid-19. This happens due to excessive inflammation or other factors when our body\u2019s immune system tries to fight off the virus. \n\nOther weird symptoms are pinkeye, loss of smell and taste, strokes and neurological issues (from the blood clotting in the brain), stomach/lung/heart/kidney/skin issues due to something called a cytokine storm. It\u2019s another immune response gone bad, and it\u2019s happening in kids AFTER they\u2019re infected. Up to weeks after they\u2019re infected. Luckily steroids are reducing these symptoms in children.\n\nNow to what you really care about is the role of companies that you scum can invest in. You hope to pick the right company so you can triple your money. That\u2019s why you\u2019re here. So maybe you should read the science and decide for yourself. But here\u2019s what I got:\n\nThe biotech realm has gone full steam ahead in trying to utilize the newest technologies for generating a therapeutic or a vaccine to stop people from having SYMPTOMS of Covid-19. This virus is going to spread, it\u2019s inevitable. But as long as we can treat the symptoms of the disease, then we can go on living our shitty lives. That means open for business people.\n\n- Therapeutic progress: not much....\n\nRemdesivir (Gilead: GILD) looks like it helps folks with extensive disease. \n\nHydroxychloroquine (Sanofi: SNY): I have nothing to say about this. Look it up yourself.\n\n\n- Vaccine progress: underway. The top 3 from my research: Moderna, Jenner Institute, and Sinovac.\n\nModerna (MRNA): an mRNA vaccine has been tested in humans, interim Phase 1 data released. The subjects (only 8 of them), were dosed twice with either 25 or 100 micrograms of vaccine. The subjects all seroconverted with binding antibodies, meaning the number of antibodies found in the serum of the subjects either meets or exceeds the number found in the blood of those with natural infection. Seroconversion: prefix sero- meaning serum, which are all proteins not involved in blood clotting (white blood cells). These cells produce our antibodies. Suffix -conversion, meaning changing from one thing to another. The mRNA vaccine induces genetic changes in DNA to our white blood cells to produce specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (the actual virus).\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: a vaccine has never been developed and brought to market using an mRNA based technology. Take that as you will.\n\nJenner Institute (the Oxford vaccine, also partnering with AstraZenica [AZN])): this vaccine is an Adenovirus vector that carries the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This essentially mimics a natural infection: the Adenovirus is genetically modified to produce the spike protein seen on the coronavirus, and is then given to subjects. There is an immune response elicited due to antigen presentation. An antigen is a molecule which causes the body to react to an infection, such as the spike protein on the coronavirus. \n\nThis vaccine was tested in monkeys in what we call a challenge trial. A challenge trials means that a subject is given a vaccine or preventative treatment, and is subsequently expose to live bug to see if the vaccine works. They do these challenge trials in humans as well, but usually MUCH later on in the vaccine development process.\n\nThe monkeys are making specific antibodies with similar success to the mRNA vaccine. It\u2019s been useful to test in monkeys because you can then give them live coronavirus to see if the antibodies protect from infection. THE MONKEYS COULD STILL BE INFECTED BY COVID. Bad! There\u2019s still work to go.\n\nLastly there is Sinovac Biotech (SVA): this company is a provider of biopharmaceutical products in China. They utilized a whole inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus particle to make a vaccine. This means they took some living coronavirus, inactivated it through heat exposure or some other mechanism, and then use that purified product as a vaccine. They did a challenge trials on monkeys as well, and THE MONKEYS WERE PROTECTED FROM INFECTION BY COVID. Good! However promising, there are cases where protection does not translate cross-species. We need more data to assess if this is the case.\n\nNow... let\u2019s think about the implications of these vaccines. In my opinion, the FDA will approve any vaccine that produces a positive result in human trials after Phase 3 and 4 analysis, which are on a much larger scale than these Phase 1 trials. Phase 2 trials are underway for some candidates, with Phase 3 planned for later this summer. As long as these candidates remain safe during expanded testing, we might have a vaccine on the market by the end of the year (albeit in small quantities... the manufacturing efforts are being planned already for hundreds of millions of doses, but there are billions of people in the world...). \n\n2021 and beyond will be a huge year for vaccine developers. As more companies have candidates finish Phase 3 and 4 trials, they\u2019re going to want to put these vaccines to market. Usually only the best vaccines with high levels of efficacy make it to the broader population, but my gut tells me we\u2019re going to see a flood of vaccines through 2021 and 2022 that have lower efficacy but are still approved by the FDA. That means big tendies for your precious biotech stocks, if you can pick them correctly.\n\nEven if I told you to stay away from trying to pick a unicorn, you\u2019d probably still do it anyways. But I don\u2019t want to give any advice on stock picking, so just read the write up and decide for yourself. \n\nI am not invested in any of these companies. I am invested in Pfizer and Merck. I like the bigger companies because I know I\u2019m not going to lose all my money like all of you.\n\nTLDR; vaccine programs underway to treat the Rona. Potentially big tendies for successful ones. I\u2019m not investing in any of them, except for big Pharma.", "created_utc": 1590154723.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gojiif/investment_advice_from_a_biochemist_talking_about/", "is_self": true}
