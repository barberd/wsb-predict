But something wasn't quite right today. I opened RH during my lunch break and for some reason I'm down on my SPY 2/12 327C that I bought at market open. I figured the app was broken because why else would it be red? It's literally green on my home screen and everyone in the comments of WSB always say \"stonks only go up\". I knew something was wrong, but couldn't quite put my finger on it. After actually looking at my CNBC app for the first time since my family disowned me I came to the realization that ALL YOU AUTISTS ARE FUCKING PANIC SELLING BECAUSE OF GOD KNOWS WHAT. THE BEER VIRUS IS A HOAX AND JPOW IS PARTYING WITH JEFF BEZOS AND LITERALLY DOESN'T GIVE A FUCK WHAT THESE STUPID POLITICIANS HAVE TO SAY ABOUT IT. GET. IT. TOGETHER. BULLS. EITHER RIDE THE TRAIN TO HELL OR GET THE FUCK OFF AT THE CORNER OF BEAR ST.
