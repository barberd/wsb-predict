{"id": "gjyhon", "title": "The Passive ETF Ponzi Scheme", "selftext": "Just us autists in here right?   \n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Leans in, whispers*  \n\nLet me tell you why the stock market keeps going up like clockwork every day in the face of horrific economic news. This is the reason why stonks will keep going up until something big breaks.     \n\n\n&nbsp;\n  \nThis might be the longest read you've ever seen on Wall Street Bets. Like I give a fuck. Just tell me where I'm wrong.  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe most important 4 things you need to understand about your shitty out-of-the-money 5/22 SPY Puts are:\n\n**Passive ETFs now dominate the stock market.** \nPassive ETFs drive everything. They drive market direction, they drive pricing. The sheer volume and size of Passive ETFs now determines market direction.  \n\n**Passive ETFs care about flow. Passive ETFs do not care about the traditional market role of price discovery.** \nIf money comes in the door, Passive ETFs have a mandate to buy stocks or bonds, no matter what. No one at Vanguard is investing based on a return on investment calculation. Passive ETFs don't give a shit about price. Is MSFT trading at $1M/share and generating $1 cash per year in profits? Is it part of the S&P 500 index which your passive ETF tracks? The ETF buys MSFT. Will it be 100 years before TSLA pays back any cash flow to investors? Who gives a shit. It is in the index. Durrr buy. This is a problem that no one is thinking about. For those lucky few of you who ever held a job, think back to any projects your company had you doing. Did they throw money at you without thinking or were they hoping for *a return on the cash they invested*? You probably had a hurdle rate or something similar, a goal to earn 10% or more above the initial investment cost. Example: If you buy an ice cream truck for autists for $100, maybe you hope to sell $10 worth of ice cream every month, paying off your investment in 10 months and generating profits after that. Passive ETFs DGAF about returns. When money flows from your paycheck to them, they buy.  \n\n**Passive ETFs impact prices for everyone in the market, including themselves.** \nMany money managers do not grasp this fact yet because they'd rather ignore the issue entirely. It's embarrassing for money managers to get their asses kicked by literally the dumbest Buy/Sell algorithm ever. The academics have been almost completely silent on this point, but the Sharpe ratio which drove a lot of the original Passive ETF construction is absolutely volatile shit. This will end in tears.   \n\n**Passive ETF flows are driven by 401k contributions. Job goes away = $ flow goes away.**  \n\nWatch this presentation and refute literally any part of it and I will eat a cockroach: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-rJciYZmi0  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nOK you say, so all of this depends on flows, and therefore stocks go up when money comes in. But white collar layoffs which are just starting to... oh shit.     \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nYes. You get it now.    \n\n\n&nbsp;\nThese are also problems:  \n**Corporations have paused buybacks to conserve cash.**\n**Our largest, most wealthy generation is now frantically rotating from stocks to bonds.** Yields are low, but do you think they're buying stocks right now? Fuck no. Boomers are rotating to bonds. Because bonds are \"safe\". Here's the data: https://ici.org/research/stats/flows/combined/combined_flows_05_13_20  \n\nSo Joe the Plumber is selling all of his shitty, actively managed mutual funds and shifting into DUM DUM DUM passive bond ETFs. Surely, at a time of record corporate debt to equity ratios, nothing can go wrong there. Oh yeah, and record amounts of the bonds in question are \"covenant lite\" which means Joe is giving money to companies with no strings attached. Sounds a lot like equity doesn't it? https://wtvbam.com/news/articles/2020/apr/30/the-devils-in-the-detail-for-junk-debt-investors-facing-coronavirus-defaults/1012738/   \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut it gets more complex.   \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Boomer Bailout 2 Gonna Boom**\nBoomer Bailout 2 has been a truly epic extraction of trillions of wealth from Gen X and Gen Z to prop up the bond markets in the U.S. What did the Fed roll out first? Trillions for bond ETFs, for Boomer Bailout 2. Small business support can *cough* come later on. Hand-waving, vague promises. JWow.   \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPop Quiz 1: When a company issues more bonds, but profits stay level or decline who gets fucked? The equity holders. Now do that, but at a nation-state level.   \n\nPop Quiz 2: Who is increasing their equity holdings in the US? Gen Z and Gen X on autopilot 401ks, who have been trained to BTFD from the last bailout.  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Governments All Over the World Are Printing to Prop Up Local Markets**\nThe Japanese Government has been buying Japanese stocks for *years now*. The ECB is a similar story but with bonds. Smart companies issue debt in Europe when they can. See LVMH's deal to acquire TIF: https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-02-07/louis-vuitton-gets-help-from-the-ecb-for-16-billion-tiffany-deal  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nChina has truly epic amounts of off-book debts, estimated to be more than 3x GDP. All of this matters because it shows that there is a bigger game afoot. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-economy-debt/chinas-debt-tops-300-of-gdp-now-15-of-global-total-iif-idUSKCN1UD0KD  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNo country wants to take the pain associated with a real multi-year depression. So, every major country is printing and propping up their market.    \n\nSide Note: Watch China's foreign currency reserves shrink in the coming months. It's gonna get spicy. Something like 30-40% of Chinese GDP is trade dependent... and they've pissed everyone off. Trade war 'bout to get real.\n\n\n&nbsp;  \n\nWhy am I telling you all of this? Because I have no clue when things turn south again, but there probably has to be some kind of tipping point:  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Boomer rotation from stocks to bonds accelerates    \n*Shit-ton of white collar layoffs \n*The Euro or the Yuan breaks hard  \n*Massive corporate debt defaults  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA true autist can't discount Fed support. The Fed could outright buy American stocks just to ensure we aren't the first country to fall. So straight up Puts are a no-go at today's prices. Even without the Fed solely propping up debt-loaded shitcos, the market could rip up OR down on Passive ETF volume.   \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAt some point, when people really seriously want their money back TODAY, and not 30 years from now, the market pain will be real. Until then, the ponzi goes on.  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat does a Passive ETF market structure encourage:  \n*Fraud  \n*Destruction/Misallocation of Capital (equity hodlers)  \n*High and Indiscriminate Debt Loads  \n*High Paper Marks for PE and VC's Taking Companies Public  \n*Volatility with a capital V, down or up    \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDarth John Bogle created a simple-minded monster that is going to fuck up your 401k. It was designed to follow active managers around the market, drafting off their returns. It was not designed to sit behind the wheel and drive the market. It only knows how to press the accelerator. Central banks are pumping jet fuel into the gas tank. Buckle up.    \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow that I've told you about the Passive ETF Ponzi Scheme, just promise me one thing:   \n\n&nbsp;\n\nBeing only moderately autistic I need a fucking Rainman to tell me first if they can figure out when the market will break.   \n\n&nbsp;\n\nTLDR: Long July-Nov Straddles BKLN, VBR, QQQ,SPY \n\nLong July-Nov Puts on BKLN, IHY\n\nLong May-June Puts on UVXY", "created_utc": 1589501481.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gjyhon/the_passive_etf_ponzi_scheme/", "is_self": true}
