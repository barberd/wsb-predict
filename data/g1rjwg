(soon)", "selftext": " \n\nOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOK ladies and retards.\n\nWe've all read countless DD posts from other TA guys, so now I'm going to give you my take.\n\n*WE WILL START THE NEXT LEG DOWN SOON* *If not this week then the next.*\n\n**I HAVE 3 REASONS WHY:**\n\n1. **JPOWS PRINTER IS GOING TO RUN OUT OF INK:** this is my only fundamental thought process. Yes, the fed has made it clear that they will do literally anything to keep the markets afloat. Rumors of businesses opening up by May 1st. **ARE YOU GUYS FUCKING RETARDED.** This isn't a fucking game COVID-19 is the most devastating thing that could possibly happen to this economy. It's being propped up on low volume and FOMO and soon we'll see the effects of this. **OIL** is in the fucking shitter. OPEC wasn't a failure but it also wasn't not a failure. Catch my drift? **EARNINGS** yeah we saw what happened today with JPM and WFC.... complete and utter retardation. You guys know the rest...this shit is what everybody talks about.  \n \n2. **THE BASICS:**\n\n* **VOLUME:** ever since we saw the first big rally off of the lows, we've been experiencing decreasing volume. This is especially true in the past week. This is a telltale sign that the ascending wedge and descending wedge are coming to fruition. The market is running out of steam and soon it will fall again.\n* **VOLATILITY:** For the most part going on I don't expect to see any more circuit breakers until the summer when we begin to see the effects of COVID on credit and bond markets as well as Q2 earnings. I do, however, believe that VIX is going to rise in the near future. I don't think it'll get to what it was at in March, but it will go up. Here's a crayon drawing to show you why.   \n \n\n[descending wedge on $vix](https://preview.redd.it/afxbyaqddzs41.png?width=1692&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb5db2461c49b40171a3229ad9c89171d87599bd)\n\n1. **ASCENDING WEDGE:** make fun of me all you want but this shit is tried and true. I don't give a shit about you gay bulls talking about *JPOWS printer* and a *Black Swan Event.* Both of these things are glaringly obvious but they don't discount the natural movements of markets.  \n \n\n[$spy ascending wedge](https://preview.redd.it/5ku3oqhfczs41.png?width=1688&format=png&auto=webp&s=83c83cfedf48e06c149bd4fd0c87d4e7963bcda3)\n\nif you don't know what this is.... look it up :D\n\ntl;dr: This is simply my prediction for where the market is headed. This shit is not priced in whatsoever and you're retarded if you think it is. **$SPY 6/19 240P $VIX 6/19 60C**", "created_utc": 1586956006.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1rjwg/the_running_of_the_bulls_is_over_soon/", "is_self": true}
