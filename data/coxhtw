{"id": "coxhtw", "title": "Shorting Canadian Banks", "selftext": "I personally think Canadian banks are shit. I want to buy puts on CIBC and BMO but I left my internship for a higher paying job that still didn't even call me in for work. Low grade pussy nigga except RBC. TD &amp; CIBC tried to sell me a credit card even though I told them I was a broke student. My nigga BMO is worked so hard on their sales pitch to retards. as fast as possible. Conversation goes as follows:\n\nMe: Can I get overdraft protection?\n\nBank of Montreal FA (Financial Advisor): Sadly, we can give you overdraft protection without proof of income. \n\nMe: Are you sure? TD gives overdraft protection and I presumed BMO does the same.\n\nFA: BMO doesn't offer overdraft protection without proof of income. We could sign you up for a credit card if you want? It gives you more money and helps build your credit score. I will start the application for you today and you should see some mail sent your way in the coming week.\n\nMe: Oh I don't think it would be a good idea. Mail being sent to my house would be problematic.\n\nFA: Why? \n\nMe: Usually, mail address to me is from collection agencies &amp; my parents always pay the bill for me even though I tell them not to. My parents wouldn't approve of me applying for a credit card knowing that they will enviably pay it down in the future.\n\nFA: No problem. You see Canada Post allows you to have a virtually p.o. box and you can get mail through there.\n\nFA: You are 20 years old. You are old enough to make your own decisions. When will you be your own man? I have seen 15 year old parents more responsible and mature than you. Man up.\n\nMe: Sorry.", "created_utc": 1565534386, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/coxhtw/shorting_canadian_banks/", "is_self": true}
