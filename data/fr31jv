{"id": "fr31jv", "title": "The Obvious put? - Someone's gotta be the target", "selftext": "With the market once more heading into retreat one should ask yourself... who is the next OBVIOUS but not EASILY picked biggest loser.\n\nHaving completed this exercise with a merry band of cutthroat investing pirates we quickly removed the first (raw goods) and secondary sectors (manufacturing) and moved to the tertiary business sector (Services).\n\nNow many of these service industries already have been punished especially the obvious customer facing companies such as Hotels, Travel, Transportation, etc.  In discussions it became obvious that while there where many smaller companies to consider it was more interesting looking for a darling company.  One that had sufficient cash flows, likely to survive, but was being propped up by an overly enthusiastic marketplace unwilling to easily jump on and start beating the company for being overvalued.\n\nThis led to Microsoft... Why this tech giant?  \n\n1) Predictable client behavior\n\n2) Predictable Business behavior\n\n3) Predictable market reaction\n\nWe are heading into a recession, and you'd have to be an alleged ostrich lover not to concur with this viewpoint.  Hence the following MS Client truths - \n\n1) People will be making technology work longer than normal as job losses deter people from purchasing new windows and office based products the continued lifeblood of MS business\n\n2) Businesses will be reducing their licensing where possible and their cloud spend as quickly as they can to reduce overall expenditures\n\nMicrosoft of course will react as they have in past recessions which is buckle down, look for companies to purchase on the cheap, and negotiate with the clients to ensure longer agreements in exchange for immediate reductions.  This however will be a longer term play and unlikely to hit the 4/22 earnings report.  A report that coincides nicely with the exponential impact of Covid-19 fatalities and infections and demands an outlook adjustment for 2020.  Very predictable and very certain.\n\nLastly, Microsoft's position as a component of the major indices ensures that they will go down with the remainder of the ship... but how far, how will the market react?\n\nThat's the convenient part of this analysis that we saw... was that Microsoft has had a nice predictable floor of around $135 for the last two drops...  and if we're coming into another drop then falling past this $135 floor is a certainty if the rest of the market goes down.\n\nSo we have logical client behavior, logical business behavior, and likely market behavior... In short... this is likely to be just to obvious to work.  \\*Note already bought these positions on Friday mid day... so would I buy more on Monday - Yes, if we go green for even a moment.\n\nThere's your play... all hypothetical logic based on consumer sentiments... In other words... this is probably a horrible plan.\n\nTLDR - MSFT $135 Puts 5/15", "created_utc": 1585472812.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fr31jv/the_obvious_put_someones_gotta_be_the_target/", "is_self": true}
