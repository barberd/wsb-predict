{"id": "ev5i5c", "title": "Health Insurance Tendies", "selftext": "Guys, get your damn UNH puts. I'll tell you why:\n\nWithout a doubt, UNH will be a very busy company over the coming 2-6 weeks. This isn't a good thing, though.\n\nAs I'm sure you all know, UNH is a health insurance provider. These guys make their money when somebody is insured by them, and doesn't have any reason whatsoever to see a doctor. Their ideal client is someone who pays premium and never gets sick. Their ideal quarter is one in which every hospital in the country is empty. Their ideal country is one in which everyone has to pay for the service UNH provides, but never actually uses it. They make the most when they have to do nothing at all.\n\nUNH is Theta gang, who sells premium against disease.\n\nWhether you think that the Wuhan Flu is an actual issue or not, one thing is certain: people are frightened by it. Although most times people just \"shrug off\" cold like symptoms, with the recent sensationalist headlines, there will be an unexpectedly high amount of clinic/ER visits for silly little runny noses and other bullshit. Although these won't be bonafide Wuhan Flu cases, UNH will still have to pay out for the MD/hospital services rendered. If WuFlu actually DOES end up being something... just look up the daily cost of an ICU visit to get an idea of the claims payouts UNH might be looking at.\n\nFurthermore, it's looking like there is a growing threat to UNH's very market niche. There is rising fear and uncertainty in the market that there will even be a **role** for UNH if Bernie implements universal health care. Whether you think public health care is a good idea or not, and whether you think Bernie might/should be president, it's clear that there is a growing possibility that American health care may join the rest of the developed world with a public health system. If this happens, would UNH even have a product to sell?\n\nIf health care goes public, UNH and others will be left with nothing other than their dicks in their hands. Their sole product will become obsolete. Imagine being a horse shoe salesman when Henry Ford popularized the car. Imagine being a slide rule manufacturer at the advent of the calculator. Despite having a $30B market cap, UNH could possibly be left with the same valuation as $LEH.\n\nUNH is theta gang, during the world's largest health care scare in over 15 years. They're Abacus Inc., just as a new calculator shop is opening up down the street. \n\nGet your goddam puts.", "created_utc": 1580217558, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ev5i5c/health_insurance_tendies/", "is_self": true}
