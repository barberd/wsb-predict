Bull market, stonks only go up, free money. Hypothetically say I managed to lose 12k over the course last year, so i can write 3k off to that year on the hypothetical income tax i would be getting so I\u2019d have 9k in write offs left. And let\u2019s just say by happenstance I\u2019m holding onto some TSLA puts in the new year, and they\u2019re looking tasty and i want to close out at 8k profit, can i only write off 3k so I\u2019m taxed on 5k? Or can i write it all off and have 1k I\u2019d write off left?\n\nAlso, of course this didn\u2019t happen or anything bull gang for life. except for that one time i lost 15k when Trump started a trade wars with China but then when i went bear Jay Powell said stay bull gang you cuck, and lost another 5k.", "created_utc": 1579786895, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/est9i8/how_do_tax_write_offs_work/", "is_self": true}
