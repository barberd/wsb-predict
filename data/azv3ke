I have spent 4k for them, sold all for 3k circa. \nToday the value of the contracts would be near 60k. \nI have come to the conclusion that the Gods of the market fucking hate me.\nBesides that, it could be worse. I could have been on that plane. I'm sorry for all the victims, their loss is far beyond my 60k. \nStill...Fuck me.\n", "created_utc": 1552320001, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/azv3ke/short_sad_story_involving_ba_puts/", "is_self": true}
