{"id": "fn2fmy", "title": "SPY Support & Resistance DD", "selftext": "[https://imgur.com/a/wddz4Mw](https://imgur.com/a/wddz4Mw)  \\- Top graph 5m 3/16-3/20, bottom SPY daily Feb-April 2018.\n\nI only trade with support/resistance & VWAP while watching level 2 data. Some people like a lot of other studies, that's fine but I feel it's unnecessary. If you are just using a line graph or robinhood charts, you deserve to lose money. \n\nThe SPY went sideways this week for an important reason. You clearly see the SPY tried to retest $255 6 times, then it tested $250 5 times. Why is $250-255 important? Bottom chart - The first bottom is Feb 2018, the next one is March-April 2018 which is around $250.  The SPY then bottomed in Dec 2018 at $235 (no screenshot, go look at a fucking graph).\n\nIf you guys would get an actual charting software you might not have gotten burnt at the witching hour. I loaded up on SPY 4/13 $200 puts, about 20mins before the close. Why? Because it failed to break out over that $235 resistance (Dec 2018 low). Now we are fully under major support levels, we we should go to the next support at $213, which is around Oct 2016 levels. I know everyone is mad that WSBs was wrong about the witcher, but it's still good to listen to people, form a hypothesis of what you think might happen, then let the graph tell you if it's correct or not in real time. \n\nMy next move - Selling my puts Monday or Tuesday, if we get below $215. Watching for the stimulus bill to pass, as once that happens, I believe the SPY will try to retest $250 again, maybe even $270. You can try to get calls for this, but you gota be quick and be ready to exit. Once it hits $250, I'll be looking to load up on late April-may puts. \n\nPositions -  https://imgur.com/OkMjCWo \n\nTl/dr - Get a real fucking chart.
