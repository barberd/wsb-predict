And Similarweb shows traffic up 81% see here: https://i.imgur.com/7SWoNYb.png   \n\nIf they hit 70 million subscribers that's likely profitable. Yeah parks are going to be down, but only closed on March 12th so the impact will be barely felt into earnings. The only thing that will matter is this subscriber number. Disney will easily show that they are well capitalized and the transition to digital will show that they can weather the next year. The timing of Disney Plus is near perfect. Disney has already quickly moved movie debuts online including the amazing Artemis Fowl (if you dont have this on your calendar put it on for June 12 and then buy DIS calls then too cuz that shit is tight).\n\nHere are my bets. Had to try all the strikes and dates that way I won't get screwed by the theta meta greeks. Cant catch me on all of them you market maker Elon Musk tweet China tarrifs sons of bitches!!!!\n\nMy plays ($26k): https://i.imgur.com/Z2iDSUf.png   \n\ncrazy people: dis jun 19 $135   \nbitch asses: dis 5/15 $110", "created_utc": 1588528662.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gcuzdn/dis_yolo_on_earnings_and_dd/", "is_self": true}
