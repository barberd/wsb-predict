I figure other people will see this as well and buy stock prior to earnings, so i will be able to sell the options at a profit before the announcement, and get some of the tendies while being able to not have all the risk.\n\nif the stock goes down before earnings, i will hold, figuring earnings will now be against the lower stock price which will still get me tendies upon the announce.", "created_utc": 1574088330, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dy42no/14_k_tgt_wmt_retail_yolo/", "is_self": true}
