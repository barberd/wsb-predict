The short interest is about 70% or so, with the most recent short borrow rate (from Friday) at about 10%. It has the ingredients for a short squeeze, but hasn\u2019t had the news to actually create one yet. I believe that is about to change. \n\nOn Dec 19th, one of PTON\u2019s instructors, Jess King, mentioned that the company has 2 million members during their live class. Shoutout to u/gsgun for bringing it to our attention in a post! A member is a user account. As per PTON\u2019s S1, the average subscribing household has 2.0 members. Think of a couple that owns a Peloton exercise bike and each person has their own member account to track their progress. When PTON IPOd, they had 1.4m members and as of last quarter (fiscal 1Q2020), they had 1.6m members. If they hit 2m members by December 19th, this is a big deal. \n\nTo get to 2m members, they added about 400k members (accounts). If the avg membership per subscription stayed the same, that means they added about 200k new subscribers with 11 days (including Xmas shopping days!) to go before the end of the quarter. So maybe by the time the current quarter (fiscal 2Q2020) ends, they will have added 250k connected subscribers? \n\nThis would be a huge deal. On their prior quarter\u2019s call, they guided to having 680-685k by the end of December. This compares to having 562,774 connected subscribers at the end of September, or essentially guiding to growth of about 122k connected subs. They could essentially double that numbers this quarter. They could be on pace for 813k subs this quarter, nearly hitting their FULL YEAR fiscal 2020 guidance of 885-895k connected subs. \n\nThis might have been a passing mention of 2m subs, or maybe she rounded up, but clearly if it is even CLOSE to 2m subs, they are on pace to blow their own guidance out of the water and accelerate growth\u2026", "created_utc": 1577045512, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ee9mlm/pton_might_have_2m_members_and_is_sandbagging/", "is_self": true}
