The last 4 earnings they have had went better than the shitty expectations that were given and every single time stock price soared after earnings. Analyst say Guardant Heath is one of the top stocks in this Industry with massive growth as well as their advancements on their medicine which is doing phenomenal this year. So IV doesn\u2019t kill our tendies I recommend a Vertical Call Spread. \n\nTo sum it up for all the retards:\n- $GH always soars after earnings(like stamps.com)\n- Prices are down rn\n- Company looking promising with new medicine\n- Analyst say buy\n- Do vertical spread to avoid IV\n\nMay the tendies be with you all in these dark times.", "created_utc": 1582566064, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f8uv29/a_little_gh_dd_for_the_bulls/", "is_self": true}
