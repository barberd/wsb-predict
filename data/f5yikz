Look what happened to MSFT you can\u2019t hype up a stock forever. Anyways not a gay bull but when SPCE falls it\u2019s gonna fall pretty good so I\u2019d be careful. I\u2019d at least like to see SPCE hold till Thursday when they present at Barclays because that\u2019s an optional presentation and they have got to be giving good news.", "created_utc": 1582059024, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f5yikz/yall_going_to_kill_spce_before_it_even_gets_to/", "is_self": true}
