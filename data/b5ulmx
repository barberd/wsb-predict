It spiced things up indeed. Long story short. After a few weeks of ups and downs and finally breaking even, I need to take a short break. On days of red, I find myself checking my portfolio with my eyes glued to the price charts. On weekends, I read up on everything I can about the companies I\u2019m invested in.
