The IRS is more autistic than my TZA position.\n\nIn any case, please consider the following information before you blow your tax account on TSLA $600 4/20 calls or cocaine and midget strippers.\n\nWho am I kidding, no one has a tax account.  How would they get tendies then?\n\n1.) tax payments are pushed to July 15th.  \n\nAs far as I understand this is for all penalties and interest related to the payment.\n\n2.) the actual tax return is still due April 15th unless an extension is created. \n\nIt is unknown if failure to file penalty fines will still apply.  If they do, y\u2019all better bend over if you don\u2019t get an extension.\n\n3.) assume all estimated payments keep the same deadline.  So April 15th will still be the first quarterly payment.\n\n7/15 $70 WTKWY calls:\nIf that company can survive a hack that lost 90% of its users identities, beer virus ain\u2019t shit.", "created_utc": 1584479880.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkdarz/the_irs_pushed_back_the_tax_deadline/", "is_self": true}
