Mister, are you still out there? Can you take a break from having sex with our mothers to post your gains?\n\nThis was months ago but I remember a guy went 1.5 million long on gold.\n\nAlso, there was a dude who bought 1,000 puts on AAL for an April strike at 22.50. Where the fuck are you? Can you buy me something?\n\nAnyways, I just put about 5K into credit call spreads and puts on SPY so it's going to go back up. This is a warning for all of you to sell. Sorry.\n\nEdit: 35 304/305 Credit Call spreads expiring tomorrow. 302 Puts expiring tomorrow, and 290 puts expiring next Friday.", "created_utc": 1583420625.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fdwhee/wasnt_there_a_guy_who_shorted_spy_2_million/", "is_self": true}
