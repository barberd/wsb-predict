{"id": "chl4ap", "title": "Option trades for the blind followers (Don't call it rage trading)", "selftext": "Welcome, weary traveler. Were you brutally molested by TSLA earnings? Did you look at your unfathomable gains and yet decided to hold on the 1% chance that TSLA would beat only to watch as it plummeted to the hell realm during AH? Does your brokerage still show your gains, almost as if to mock you knowing full well it will all be worth 0.0001 tomorrow? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPick yourselves up kings. For as long as you've still got that 0.0001 you've still got money to lose. And lose you will, for I have uncovered a treasure trove of amazing option trades that will make us everything we lost on TSLA back and more. However, in order for this to work, you must not do any DD of your own. Instead, once you enter these positions, all you must do is close your computer, go to or construct a shrine....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n and pray. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBABA CALLS 8/02 EXP ANY STRIKE YOU CAN AFFORD\n\nNFLX PUTS 8/02 EXP ANY STRIKE YOU CAN AFFORD\n\nDIS CALLS 8/16 ANY STRIKE YOU CAN AFFORD\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo not question. Start up your brokerages and put those trades in for market orders. It doesn't matter anymore. Make it all back or lose it all. That is the WSB way. Using my patented \"Buy and Pray \u00a9  \" technique, glory and gains will come to all. Godspeed, brothers. May the light shine down upon us again once we crawl out of the holes we have dug ourselves.", "created_utc": 1564044528, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/chl4ap/option_trades_for_the_blind_followers_dont_call/", "is_self": true}
