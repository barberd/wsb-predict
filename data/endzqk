{"id": "endzqk", "title": "Question about required funds for put credit spreads.", "selftext": "Im a young autistic retard who wants to get into spreads since theta fucks me when I buy calls. If I open a put credit spread with strike prices from 130 to 125, I understand the max loss is 500 dollars. But if something is in the money, like ROKU right now and I open the spread and someone does excercise the contract, what happens if I don't have the money in the account to straight up buy 100 shares since im poor? Does robinhood just take whatever my net loss is from me and handle it or am I fucked?", "created_utc": 1578779898, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/endzqk/question_about_required_funds_for_put_credit/", "is_self": true}
