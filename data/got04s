Business travel isn't coming back anytime soon and Papa Buffett has dumped them harder than your homeroom sweetheart dumped you ahead of homecoming.\n\nBut hear me out:\n\n\\- We've wrapped up a solid week of modest growth for airline stocks, after the Buffett bottom of last week  \n\\- Much of the country has started to open back up, or will be doing so in the next few weeks  \n\\- Karens and Gregs can't stand being stuck at home anymore and are itching to travel, pandemic be damned  \n\\- There is an incoming boon in consumer travel as reckless randos cash in on cheap flights and hop on planes for some long weekends to some place with a palm tree  \n\\- The increase in consumer travel will be coupled with an increase in consumer interest in airline stocks\n\nDo I think airlines are fucked for a long time? YES. But do I think there is money to be made here? YES.\n\nThe truth is, they're one of the few industries still riding just above their post-covid lows. And while their price is rightfully low, the incoming increase in consumer demand is going to bring us a nice little baby bump with a tray full of tendies for anyone who wants a bite.\n\n**The Plan:**  \n\\- Bank on America having a short attention span  \n\\- Pick up long calls on airlines on the CHEAP  \n\\- Wait for the June bump- Cash out before earnings sober everybody up  \n\n\n**Positions**: DAL $25c 1/15/21, DAL $30c 1/5/21, JBLU $10c 1/15/21, VLRS $5c 7/17", "created_utc": 1590185535.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/got04s/its_time_for_calls_on_airlines/", "is_self": true}
