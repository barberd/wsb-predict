I even commented to Patty, the sweet 67 year old seasonal cashier that I should buy some Calls, to which she agreed (she thought I was talking about the new iphone)\nSo I jump on RH while my gf is standing in line at the Starbucks in the store for her daily $6 coffee, when I see that TGT has their earnings c call in 3 days....\nHmmm, this could be a good opportunity to make some serious bank, get those tendies going!\n\nWell turns out my balls are too small and I didn\u2019t buy any calls cuz I\u2019m a baby back bitch.
