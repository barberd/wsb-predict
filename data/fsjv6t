I\u2019ve already seen multiple posts proclaiming put holders have \u201cmade it\u201d and \u201cbulls r fuk\u201d. Chances are most of you are still down 50-99% of your entire portfolios this week. Calm the fuck down, if we hit a circuit breaker u can shit post all you want. It\u2019s fucking cringe to watch all these regards getting excited that their SPY 210P 4/3\u2019s are almost positive *for the fucking day*. Tomorrow and Thursday will be the real dealbreakers for this week as today is EOM and lots of news Thursday \n\nWe have a hell of week coming at us.. gold is starting to fall and USD looks like it\u2019s ready to pivot back up. Another weekly jobs report that is *expected* to do horribly. We could hit another 5m and SPY will be green for days. Sit the fuck down and keep ask a bull to lend you some money for TVIX\n\nPositions:\n4/3 SPY 230P and SPY 245P\n4/9 SPY 223P and SPY 230P\n4/17 SPY 235P\n\nYea I\u2019m fucked too", "created_utc": 1585684186.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fsjv6t/calm_yourself/", "is_self": true}
