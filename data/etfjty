This is what we know:\n\n1: The coronavirus is now on all seven continents and spreading rapidly.\n2: As of now there is no vaccine for the virus, and officials are saying that a vaccine would take over a year to create.\n3: Early attempts to contain the virus clearly have not worked.\n\nBefore you call me a dirty fucking bear, turn your autistic brain on and try to read another couple sentences.  The coronavirus has a long incubation period -- up to two weeks and maybe even a little longer.  THAT MEANS THERE ARE PROBABLY ALREADY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD WITH THE VIRUS IN THEIR SYSTEM.  Hysteria is only going to build over the weekend and Monday is going to be blood red, so buy your fucking SPY puts now and recuperate from the 70% loss on your autistic dailies.", "created_utc": 1579895399, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/etfjty/this_coronavirus_is_a_golden_fucking_opportunity/", "is_self": true}
