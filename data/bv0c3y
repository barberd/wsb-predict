I love the direction QCOM is heading and I do own some of QCOM, but SWKS is lower in valuation right now in my opinion. CTL is very low right now, but I want to wait for a sign of reversal before possibly looking into buying in. I also own a bit of VZ, but I like T better for dividend and value. However, debt remains a huge problem for T.\n\nHere is a further explanation for those stocks.
