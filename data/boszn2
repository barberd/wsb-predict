Performance tests are conducted using specific Mac computers. Actual results will vary based on model, configuration, usage, and other factors.\n&gt;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210107\n\n* AMD, ARM, and other CPUs are not affected", "created_utc": 1557892494, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/boszn2/zombieload_the_newest_intel_cpu_vulnerability/", "is_self": true}
