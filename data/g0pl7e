{"id": "g0pl7e", "title": "AMRN Conference Call today", "selftext": "Amarin is an Irish biotech that makes prescription fish oil pills to help with heart disease etc. Surprisingly, people buy the shit outta this. Unfortunately for Amarin, a trash judge ruled against the company allowing competitors to begin selling generic versions of the drug crashing the stock 70% in one day from $14 to $4. Fortunately for Amarin, the methodology used in the ruling was incorrect and should hopefully be overruled on appeal. The company has been mostly silent since the ruling but the stock has rallied back to $6.40 and there is a surprise conference call at 330 EST this afternoon that can be streamed at www.amarincorp.com.\n\nNo reason to do a conference call unless there is some decent news. \n\nOf course it is also possible that management are retards and disappoint like my wife always does.\n\nPossible good news would be a partner to help begin sales in Europe where generics are not an issue, filing an injunction against generic manufacturers even though they are not yet ready to begin sales, great prescription and earnings numbers, and the \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc02 wet dream of a buyout (highly unlikely).\n\nSorry for the short notice but I thought I would share since I am \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc02\n\nAMRN 4/17 400 6c, 235 7c\n\nMay your wife's boyfriend's dick be in you...always.", "created_utc": 1586805312.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0pl7e/amrn_conference_call_today/", "is_self": true}
