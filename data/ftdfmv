The option  now costs $6.00 but you don't really want it now because you were supposed to buy 1 for $6.00 not 2 for $7.00, weren't you? Fucking stooge. Plus you're an out of work bartender who can't even spell the word compitent correctly so everything you're doing is probably wrong and the more of it you do, the worse it's gonna be. \n\nBut don't worry little beartender, SPY goes up again and now you're a genius. Just buy a 2nd 5/15 SPY put for 4.00 then \"go home jerk off, and that's all you gonna do.\" You got the price you wanted you just have 1 more than you wanted. No problem,\n\nremember you're a genius right now. \n\nWake up a couple days later from a 14th consecutive  night of heavy drinking, sell 1 of those options for 6.50 and keep the other one so it can expire worthless while you spam f5 on the DES website. \n\nWho wants a fucking mojito? \n\nPostitions\nSPY 5/15 210P\nLYFT 5/15 22.5P\nSLV 7/15 15 C\nMSFT 7/17 190C", "created_utc": 1585791874.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ftdfmv/the_old_shake_and_bake/", "is_self": true}
