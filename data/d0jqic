{"id": "d0jqic", "title": "For Options Traders", "selftext": "Somewhat of a roller coaster month of options and ER. Below are some of the option picks that I feel are discounted and worth looking into:\n\nGold: Holistically down 8% on average from this week.\n\n* GOLD\n* AUY\n* HMY\n* NUGT\n* JNUG\n* EGO\n\nGold for me is a definite buy as options are slashed 80% from highs. Low risk, high rewards as it usually inverses SPY. Spy looking a bit beefed up with \"trade war optimism\". Not sure why we are optimistic seeing that Trump boasted about \"trade talks going very well\" on multiple occasions only to be a bearer of terrible news the follow day or even hours. \n\nCannabis: Cannabis sector have also taken a huge hit. Down 12% holistically. \n\n* OGI\n* CGC\n* HEXO\n* MEDIF\n* Of course big brother TLRY\n\nCannabit sector is a huge opportunity for buy in especially at slashed prices. Historically they get 10-15% pumps intraday or 15-20% intraweek once the ball gets rolling. Can't hurt to go long seeing as this industry is starting to optimize distribution, products, overhead costs - and policy makers are becoming more lenient with CBD treatments in school (Controversial, but a good win for this industry nonetheless).", "created_utc": 1567790909, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d0jqic/for_options_traders/", "is_self": true}
