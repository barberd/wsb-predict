Why do we still have 100 point swings and why do we have face ripping dips and rallies? As previously mentioned, this correction was the fastest in history and the markets haven't experienced volatility like this since the 2008 financial crisis. \n\nSo let's take a look at what happened since the 2008 financial crisis:\n\n[SPY 15 Yr\\/1 Wk ](https://preview.redd.it/odhcwrrzm9l41.png?width=2108&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a60f0a5676e979883b3b04a5e64fe61ec1140166)\n\nThe rapid selling of 1 week reached a selling climax and found support at 284.82, the October 2019 low. At 10 am, the Fed announced an emergency 50 bps rate cut, where SPY briefly peaked at 313.84. In effect, we are **range bound between 313.84 and 284.82.** Think of this as the high volatility zone. \n\n[SPY 10 Day\\/ 30 min](https://preview.redd.it/fzeczc0ko9l41.png?width=2108&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9e6b02f91d9c6a4761ffc6252d91a036bb92d74)\n\nThis is not the first time that this pattern has occurred in market cycles. Wyckoff provides a convenient road map. This is not to say that we are in accumulation phase. On the contrary, I believe we will continue to the downside and we will enter a distribution phase to the downside. 285.54 served as our lower bound in our trading range, upon which a large automatic rally happened and was short lived. \n\nMarket makers do not necessarily trade stocks or options like we do. We have to realize they really trade off of volatility. As previously noted, when autists such as ourselves rapidly purchase options, market makers purchase the underlying asset in order to delta hedge or be delta neutral, and take advantage of the change in gamma and vega. Think of the delta as the first rate of change of the asset, and that gamma is the second derivative, the rate of change of the rate of change. Thus, while delta is linear, gamma is non-linear and really gives you the tendies in a long position. Theta is the rate of time decay, and eats away at your profits. The gamma flip happened at around 323.17, since MM are more or less net short starting when we passed the 283.2% retracement from the 2008 lows. \n\n[SPY Put\\/Call Gamma and Prob. ITM](https://preview.redd.it/t3hfsebpw9l41.png?width=2822&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f825ee391efd404e85c7743478ac299e835b550)\n\nStarting around the 325 strike, there are large increases in gamma for both put and call positions, along with corresponding changes in the probability of being in the money for these options. Okay, so MM are most likely short gamma and we are in a place of high volatility, and VIX will continue to remain at elevated levels in this range-bounded zone. So what's next? The biggest problem right now facing the market is uncertainty. Thus, we are most likely going to retest 285, which Wyckoff refers to as a secondary test due to price action on 3/6/20. The 2% rally in the last 10-15 min of trading is most likely due to short covering. Everyone screaming that the Fed is pumping need to realize that MM want to close and lock in profits after 2 red days, especially when heading into the weekend. Due to this uncertainty and with additional bad news over the weekend, we likely are going to still face more downside as we close near the 285, before rallying again. \n\nThe question over the coming weeks is will we rally again, form new resistance, and then break out of this high volatility zone? Let's take a look at the number of cases of coronavirus within the United States. \n\n[Coronavirus reported infections, Jim Bianco](https://preview.redd.it/t2dsmaw30al41.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b0b07254a7d3c057cf798a75b27a28e11896664)\n\nNote the Y-axis is logarithmic. This means that unless we see a plateauing, or curvature of the line for cases, we are in an exponential phase of growth. Again, we as humans have a relatively easy time grasping linear relations (e.g. delta), but have difficulty rationalizing exponential or non-linear trends. As of 11:20 AM, EST, the US has 340 confirmed cases. Another increase of approximately 20% cases compared to yesterday. \n\nCDC reports 164 cases and 11 deaths. Simply dividing case number by deaths does not give the true mortality, since there is a delay of 1-2 weeks from the incubation period. However, this number would be even higher since the CDC had fewer cases. For this example, we will just divide case number and deaths for now, giving a mortality rate of 14.9%. WHO estimates a mortality of 3.4% which is close to what Italy has. In reality, due to limited testing, the mortality rate might be closer to 1% which is 10x higher than the flu. How many undiagnosed cases do we really have in the United States? The next few weeks will reveal a problem orders of magnitude larger than expected. Hence, a retest of the 285 will be essential to test the resilience of the market. \n\n[GLD 10 D\\/30 min ](https://preview.redd.it/8ubsl9try9l41.png?width=2114&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=adc3264c009f913494ab9a6ce68b68af5f8fd4bd)\n\nOne more quick note. During high financial stress and downside, gold will be quickly sold and liquidated in order to cover other positions. We are repeatedly entering cycles where gold hits new highs, followed by large swings in the S&amp;P. These are good opportunities to enter quick short positions as gold hits new highs. Pending another large leg down, especially around the 285 retest, we will see gold quickly sold off again. Only until we exit the high volatility zone, do I believe gold will stabilize and continue a run up higher. Before this occurs, we may see gold prices reach 1400-1500 first. \n\nThings to look at are the 10-yr, additional pending rate cuts from the next FOMC meeting, and oil prices. Commodities tend to provide a more clean signal compared to equities about the global macroeconomic status.", "created_utc": 1583598288, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fexdfl/volatility_is_here_to_stay_why_the_market_will/", "is_self": true}
