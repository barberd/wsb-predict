I'd like to make this public and update it each day, but I don't know if it'll have too much traction with you guys to make it worth it.\n\nThis chart shows the volume of unusual options trading and on which days and which expirations. It makes it easy to find which symbols are going up or down in the next three months. Clearly AMD is a buy (got that wrong in a previous post and you guys slammed me for it). However look at MGM, the odds that it's going to tank is easily seen and when folks are expecting it to.\n\nHere are some screenshots. It's more interactive if I publicly publish it and I'll try to include ETF's in it as well as spuce this thing up.\n\nData is from barchart.com\n\nAll symbols:\nhttps://imgur.com/rybO0Ya\nTSLA\nhttps://imgur.com/mu2Qarw\nAAPL\nhttps://imgur.com/lt48DkH\nAMD\nhttps://imgur.com/EMEEH1m\nMGM\nhttps://imgur.com/8bXrvsV", "created_utc": 1584587369.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fl2up1/easy_visuals_for_autists/", "is_self": true}
