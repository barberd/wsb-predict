{"id": "d72aln", "title": "The WSB ETF $SPECTRUM", "selftext": "What would happen if you inversed WSB?\n\nWhat would happen if you followed all the DD on WSB?\n\nI HAVE YOUR ANSWER! \n\nTLDR: I followed the sub blindly for a year with 0 DD. Lost all my moneys. \n\nSo one year ago I made my Reddit, specifically for this sub. Around 1 year ago today I took all of the leftover money I earned from working as a summer analyst (~$9k) and put it into Robinhood. I had been mostly investing / trading prior to dabbling in options and was pretty good at it. I could earn some extra money each month from dividends and make double digit returns. Eventually, after seeing so many of the Yolos on the sub, I knew I needed in. This sub would be my salvation. After I made it rain tendies, I wouldn\u2019t care about losing $19k on just Bitcoin. \n\nI had 3 accounts. One super safe account, one investing account, and Robinhood... You guys already know I funded that bitch. I\u2019m ranting too much but basically I levered up with Robinhood Gold and immediately had ~$18K at my fucking fingertips. It felt like having a second cock. \n\nFirst option trade ever $UVXY put for .06, expired worthless.  First real option play based on this sub was $AMD. Made money, the % gain sent blood rushing to my penis. I was hooked.  \n\nAugust - September: \n\nFollowed this sub\u2019s most popular picks.  Too many to screenshot but I\u2019ll add some in the comments. Things were AMAZING. I was making money. $TSLA $NVDA $MU, all of the meme bois. \n\nLate September - October: \n\nTilray... I made money up and down on it. The fuckery began here though. My judgement became cloudy and emotions became involved. PFDA yolos were being posted on WSB. The biotech bois seemed to have found a way to make tendies from a lab (before Beyond).  I followed advice blindly. \n\n\nThe fucking: $GERN , $ATRS, and the others. All had PFDAs and decisions in the same 2 week span. Skipped class to trade during this time. I sold everything and made a small withdrawal. Margin was available for some to buy calls. I was up higher than ever before on the news. I\u2019ll keep it short, EVERY SINGLE ONE WENT THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. My final day I was at like $11k down to a thousand in a matter of minutes. I screamed heavily. \n\nThe results: 6 margin calls (turns out they don\u2019t actually call you), PDT flag 90 day, was assigned on almost all of the options I sold,  no money left in account. Had to cover margin with the entire balance of my other accounts. Left with $181 paycheck every 2 weeks from part time job I almost quit because I was making money. My expenses were $278 per month for car insurance and a loan payment (not car). Seriously considered selling plasma. \n\nOctober - Now: \n\nWhile I didn\u2019t have analfarmer level losses, I still got royally fucked. I had a safety net so it wasn\u2019t terrible, rearranged myself financially in about 3 weeks. Stopped trading. Started trading again about a month / 1.5 months ago. Flipped $12-$55-$1600 then down to like $170 because amazon calls fucked me. Made my first $100+ deposit again for a  $ROKU put and an Amazon call. \n\n\nPersonal / Emotional details: \n\nStarted trading at the lowest point of my life in 2015.  I was dumped by my GF of 4 years, left college, failed at quitting the earth server, was in the hospital with a tumor scare and only had 2 of my friends visit the week I was there. The markets and trading became my obsession. I had no emotions when it came to investing and trading, purely numbers. My dream to run my own fund and Martin Shkreli\u2019s live streams helped me through the darkest time of my life. Ended up turning my life around quite a bit. Met another girl, fell in love, life was good. First couple months following the sub were great but then emotion clouded my judgement. Stopped doing DD almost completely. \n\nWhen I blew up my Robinhood in October I was really upset for 2 weeks. Mostly at myself for not doing DD, getting emotional when dealing with numbers, and being cocky. Gave 0 fucks after the 2 weeks because I got my heart broken again. I was a shell of myself and nothing mattered. Got back together... dumped again months later right after planning Valentine\u2019s Day. Compartmentalized this time. Was an emotional train wreck but got a full time job offer. Wasn\u2019t trading but lurked on WSB, this sub helped me through the heartbreak. Got back together again, but this time I have 0 emotion when trading again. I don\u2019t make plans on how I\u2019ll spend the money on my SO. It\u2019s just numbers now. I missed that feeling. \n\n\nLessons learned: \n\nAbsolutely nothing. Jk. I do my own DD now, spend a little less time on this sub, don\u2019t let emotion impact my plays. Not gonna use margin again for a LONG time. Robinhood sucks at filling orders but it\u2019s free. \n\nClarifications: \n\nIdk why, but Robinhood adjusts the amounts based on withdrawals / deposits so the numbers in my post might be different than the pics. Can pull up the original screenshots from my old phone if needed. \n\nI stopped trading for 9 months so this isn\u2019t fully accurate. \n\n\nFinal notes: \n\nTime from following sub to account blowup: 3 months.\n\nI\u2019m excited to blow it all up again :) \n\nI\u2019m thankful for the autists on this sub. Seriously, you helped me through really bad times. Thanks for the lols. \n\n\n\n\nOther:\n\nThanks u/soasian for pointing out it was my cake day. I was planning this post for a while. \nYTD: [$SPECTRUM Annual Performance](https://imgur.com/a/kzKWrvg)", "created_utc": 1569019163, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d72aln/the_wsb_etf_spectrum/", "is_self": true}
