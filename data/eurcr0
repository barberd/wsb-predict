These past few days ES has been slightly underperforming SO, which sets up nicely for this trade.\n\nTrade: Feb 95 calls for 0.25 OR the Mar 95 calls for 0.55\nNot a lot of premium for another month of time.", "created_utc": 1580147077, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eurcr0/unusual_options_activity_in_es/", "is_self": true}
