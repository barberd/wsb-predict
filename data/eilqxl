{"id": "eilqxl", "title": "AIMT Timing", "selftext": "So we all know that AR101 is scheduled to be approved \"late January\" and we believe that the FOMO (and the fact that AR101 is going to make a killing) will push the stock price to at least $40.\n  \nSeems like a significant opportunity.  \n  \nIs there any resource to determine when, exactly, the announcement will be? There are really attractive options that expire on the 17th that would make a killing but not if the announcement came after that point.\n\nAs this seems like as close to a sure thing as it comes, I'm seriously considering the January 17th $35 strike is it would more than double the potential profit. ($1.68 vs $3.55 for the Feb 21 option)\n\nThoughts?", "created_utc": 1577903649, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eilqxl/aimt_timing/", "is_self": true}
