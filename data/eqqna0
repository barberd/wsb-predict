Keep in mind these values are not necessarily comparable 1:1 - the underlying security and quantity varies. A high reported \"% NBBO or Better\" does not necessarily equate to a better price improvement and vice versa.\n\nA few well-known brokerages are missing from the table, such as IBKR. IBKR might be hard to compare because they provide routing options such as highest rebate and customizable smart routing. If you find their reports, let me know and I'll add it to the table.\n\n---\n\n^This ^is ^purely ^for ^informational ^purposes ^only. ^You ^should ^evaluate ^your ^own ^personal ^risk ^tolerance ^and ^requirements. ^Don't ^GUH ^yourself.", "created_utc": 1579401766, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eqqna0/retail_brokerage_execution_quality_comparison/", "is_self": true}
