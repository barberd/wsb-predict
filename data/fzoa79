{"id": "fzoa79", "title": "I'm an options seller who'd like to start buying some FDs...any tips?", "selftext": "I mainly sell CSPs, CCs, Put Spreads, and Call Spreads. \n\nAbout 10 years ago I wiped out my life savings, and wiped out my credit cards going into FDs. I almost defaulted on my credit cards debt until I got a job at the last minute. I've learned my lesson about buying FDs, and for the past 9 months I've been a seller, and my account is still good.\n\nHowever, selling isn't going to get you that YOLO life, so I want to take some risks on buying FDs. ITM and Deep ITM Options that expire at least a year from now are beyond my PRT. So I'm not sure what to do. I suppose I can do buy ATM LEAPs and sell OTM monthlies against them.\n\nBut any other ideas? What about buying FDs that expire within a week or next week, any strategies for those?", "created_utc": 1586658327.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fzoa79/im_an_options_seller_whod_like_to_start_buying/", "is_self": true}
