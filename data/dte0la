I bought ONE Disney Call today at $132 strike price exp. Nov 8 when it was trading at $133 for $3.05 avg cost. The options profit calculator estimated I'd profit $430 if Disney hits $139.50.\u00a0\n\nMy market value jumped to $335 off $30 (the Return today). This seems wrong. If I'm supposed to make $430 why doesn't Robinhood display the full $430? The market value should display $735\u00a0($3.05 X 100 =$305 + $430)? \n\nNot $335!\n\nThx", "created_utc": 1573211802, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dte0la/could_some_genius_please_explain_robinhoods/", "is_self": true}
