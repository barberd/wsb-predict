{"id": "dlpgda", "title": "Volume and OI", "selftext": " \n\nI have been tracking Volume and open interest using barchart just for studying and im not sure if the information isnt available yet but I download screener results for certain tickers in the morning and after close and what I notice is the volume has changed but the Open interests has not - and that goes for all the strike prices for the 2 tickers I am watching.\n\nBased on my understanding, Volume is the amount of transaction that has occured during a time frame and Open interest is the amount of contracts opened (meaning contracts that are currently owned by participants). So if that is the case Changing Volume and no change in OI means there were even amount of trades for both calls and puts (?)\n\nie: if there were 10 open contracts in the morning by the end of the day 5 people closed 5 contracts and another 5 people opened contracts?\n\nor are there other scenarios that would cause the volume to change but not the OI?", "created_utc": 1571782369, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dlpgda/volume_and_oi/", "is_self": true}
