Didn't sell again on Wednesday morning when it had a pump (could've still got out with 100k+ at that point), got out with 67k or so. Felt like shit, and started yoloing again because I couldn't get over the fact that I was handed two chances to get out with 100k+.\n\nIs this what it feels like to reach the bottom? I think about what a giant retard I was every minute of the day now.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/7QlkGiF.jpg", "created_utc": 1592032408.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h82pjv/50k_117_60k_4k_diamond_hands_and_trading_on/", "is_self": true}
