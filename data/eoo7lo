(I\u2019m going in solo) \n\nI was thinking I\u2019d trade options and rise to the top, the bottom line goal is to BEAT s&amp;p500 within the semester... so I\u2019ve heard most students don\u2019t really go above 20% \n\nI plan on doing hundreds of percents tbh \n\nWe have a budget of $1million and I\u2019m thinking of going all in on Apple calls $320 by Feb 1st or something \n\nThoughts? How do I turn this million into gazillion?", "created_utc": 1579022248, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eoo7lo/can_rwsb_help_me_in_my_investment_class_with_my/", "is_self": true}
