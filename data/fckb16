{"id": "fckb16", "title": "RH DIAMOND HAND CRUSADE", "selftext": "Hello gents,\n\nI am coming out of my attic for a short while to make this post. I am still alive after many attempts on my life from RH LLC. I am the one who called out robinhood for faking your positions. That post can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dshlfu/robinhood_is_fake/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\nIn my previous post, I claimed that robinhood was not actually buying your positions, but rather tracking them and selling the data. Some of you scoffed at me, but I forgive you as long as you heed my call to arms. Yet again, robinhood fulfills my prophecy. If you are still unconvinced, try to move your positions to another broker. You will find the process...enlightening.\n\nToday, robinhood has completely shat itself and prevented you and I from realizing our gains. This is a direct result of the Kung Flu bears not being able to cover their puts on margin. Robinhood had to shut down the servers to find liquidity to cover the margin they fronted.\n\nI guarantee that Robinhood will release a statement citing technical glitches and market volume overloading the servers. Do not listen to their lies.\n\n#Hence forth, I call yee men of gains, yee diamond fisted autists, and the homosexual bear gang, to answer my call to arms. I hereby declare a crusade on Robinhood Financial LLC.#\n\n\n\nBloomberg, you may contact me for your headline.", "created_utc": 1583188186, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fckb16/rh_diamond_hand_crusade/", "is_self": true}
