Money grows inside thickets of time.\n\n\\--\n\nThe health of Amazon is the health of the market. It is the titan of technological consumerism.\n\nWhat does the S&P 500 even measure, anyway? This measure of commerce and industry is old. Why is the wealth of nation comprised into 500 companies? Why is the fucking name \"Poors\" for \"Standard & Poors\" what we call the barometer for the health of stocks? It makes you poors cuz its standard is whack.\n\nThe future is Amazon. Future currency will not be printed on paper but sent by virtual gift card.  Health of this stock tells you the health of the nation. Unlike current SPY, it is connected to consumer spending. Everyone buys everything off Amazon. If not, an online retailer.\n\nIf you say it is not SPY, then it must be the NASDAQ in everything but name.\n\nAmazon is a heart with veins. It pumps blood into artery markets, and with these companies you make plays.\n\n\\--\n\nDon't chase. It's gone. Begin anew, every time.\n\n\\--\n\nThis is why Tesla grows: It is become mankind's religion, our new forward progress.\n\n\\---\n\nGrubhub wins the popularity contest. We trust our consumption to the biggest suppliers, brands we know. Grubhub got the name; the pre-eminent name in industry for its pocket of time.\n\n\\--\n\nMarket collapse is a paradigm shift: Belief systems being corrected from beliefs of what should be to see now what is.\n\n\\--\n\nDownturn and upturn are both changes of thought and tests of faith.\n\n\\--\n\nThe Market is the fucking Lifestream from FF7, the ether from Evangelion, the collective thought and emotions that people tie to livelihood. Hope is the lotto ticket, doubt is loss.\n\n\\--\n\nDon't do drugs and play stocks.", "created_utc": 1591926628.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h7bmr6/market_epiphanies/", "is_self": true}
