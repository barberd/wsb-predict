First off let me be clear, every airline besides Boeing is pretty fucked. Boeing is going to take the vast majority of the bail out money for their greedy monkey shareholders, and let other peasant airline companies die. Boeing is not a fucking airline, it is a multinational corporation which provides leading market share in helicopter parts, aeronautical parts (which SpaceX uses for 20% of all satellites they send up, which is a metric fuckton) and more importantly the second largest fucking contractor to the US military, with all kinds of missiles and new spacecraft bullshit which the military absolutely loves spending money on. \n\nTrump has stated multiple times he is a fan of Boeing as they are a patriotic company who simply shit the bed. The bailout will wipe the soupy monkey squirts off the baby diaper, until they need more money. \n\nhttps://www.defensenews.com/coronavirus/2020/03/17/trump-boeing-could-get-financial-bail-out-for-coronavirus/\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2020/03/17/business/boeing-bailout-trump/index.html\n\n$BA 150c 3/27\n\n*$BA 240c 3/27*\n\n$BA 350c 3/27\n\n***I'm balls deep***", "created_utc": 1584590173.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fl3hli/ba_is_oversold_like_a_baby_down_a_staircase_dd/", "is_self": true}
