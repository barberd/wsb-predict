I am making this post so that you all remain safe with your money. \n\n$BYND is a great investment, definitely once in a lifetime. I know in my 15+ years I have never seen a stock shoot up so astronomically unless it really had some solid earnings behind it. Right now, since their IPO (which stands for Improved Property Operation) they are in what\u2019s called a \u201clockdown period.\u201d This means that all of their shares are insured against going below a certain price until late October. The bank I work at is actually in charge of this insurance for $BYND. This price is called the strike price, and it is currently at about $150, and is guaranteed to continue rising AT LEAST until October. \n\nA \u201ccall\u201d is when you borrow another person\u2019s shares and get to skim all their profit off the top when the price goes up. Now, since the strike price is insured until October, this means ALL CALLS ON $BYND ARE COMPLETELY RISK FREE. This is supplemented by the fact that they have absolutely no foreseeable competition, and they essentially have a monopsony (this is a monopoly that\u2019s free to fool around with other people if the relationship is unfulfilling) on the market for the time being. \n\nThe best way to capitalize on this current deal is to get an account on a highly accredited brokerage (I would personally suggest Robinhood because of their excellent customer service and culture of fundamental analysis) buy calls on $BYND for as high a price target as you can, and then \u201cdouble down\u201d so to speak by going \u201con the margin\u201d (this is stock-speak for \u201cgetting loaned money\u201d and you don\u2019t need to pay back because money in the market isn\u2019t realized until you sell) and then you can reap twice the profit! Make sure you set the expiration of your calls as far out as possible, I would go into Feb 2020. Remember, calls gain value the longer they exist, so it\u2019s another clear win/win. \n\nBy 2020 BYND should easily be dominating the meat market, it\u2019s projected to account for 15% of all meat sales, which is a $1T market right now. At this current rate, your 2020 calls could net you enough money to retire, so long as you don\u2019t listen to the people on WSB trying to \u201cshort\u201d it (this is stock speak for when rich people purposely bid low on a stock to artificially reduce the price, also known as \u201cdump and pump). \n\nMake sure to keep your money safe out here, WSB may be fun to watch but you don\u2019t have to be one of the idiots wasting all their money betting.", "created_utc": 1560203151, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bz3sc2/i_am_a_professional_in_the_finance_industry/", "is_self": true}
