This is the mouse losing **80% of his revenue sources for the next 12 months.** \n\n##*\u201dBut America is doing a bad job quarantining so it\u2019ll be over sooner than that\u201d you stupidly sputter over your 3/16 Spy 300 calls. \n\nYeah, we are. But that doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t have a quarantine in effect, it just means we\u2019re going to see a MASSIVE spike in cases as soon as we start actually testing. \n\nThe thing about Beer Flu is you\u2019re infectious as soon as you catch it, and young adults often don\u2019t show symptoms **at all.**\n\n##This means thousands of Typhoid Marys are wandering the country spreading this shit faster than that 0-symptom virus you made in Plague Inc. \n\nSo what happens when we finally start testing and our numbers skyrocket?\n\nFirst off, mass panic as tens of thousands of infected people who don\u2019t even need treatment flood hospitals that are already over capacity, taking attention and resources away from immunocompromised patients that do. The news plays off this fear and people finally start to realize they should take it seriously as dead grandmas rain from the sky. \n\nWe still do social distancing. But there\u2019s far more panic than before, and we all know what the market does during mass panic. \n\n##Also, if Tariff man is positive (which he probably is) he just infected a bunch of the countries biggest CEOs on live TV.\n\nThis shit has got a lot farther to fall. \n\n**tl;dr - Late April/Early May puts. \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bgang**", "created_utc": 1584192697.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fiieap/heres_what_a_bunch_of_you_bulls_and_america_as_a/", "is_self": true}
