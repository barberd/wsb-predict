If you have a question, I invite you to read the rules and the FAQ. Then, if you still have a question, lurk in the shadows, as I did (voyeur style), read the posts and learn. Investopedia is your ELI5 and if it's too complicated to you, try to do your own research on google. You aren't the first to have the question, trust me. Please, stopping ask the sub to give you knowledge and try to bring knowledge to the sub. I am asking this because the sub went already private and a lot of people felt this. The WSB elite has already create a new private sub and it's a matter of time that they all abandon wsb for good. So, please, don't destroy the best thing that happened in the life of a lot of people.\n\nBe smart, learn and become the autist who your mother can be pround of. She want you to be the best, trust me, she told me last night. \n\nTL;DR: SPY 185p 4/17\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention, as u/Unhinged_Goose said, your newbie question will make autists here fell threaten and they will use all their mental power to remember how to write and do this kind of text.", "created_utc": 1584569416.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkya7l/newbies_please_read_this/", "is_self": true}
