Judging by the charts, this company\u2019s stock has done very well recently and I\u2019m just curious if anyone knows why.\n\nOn another note, there\u2019s a massive amount of Biotech firms performing quite well and I also don\u2019t exactly know the reason behind that and how their performance might correlate with the overall economy.\n\nSo, any juicy DD?
