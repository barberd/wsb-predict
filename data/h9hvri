{"id": "h9hvri", "title": "Outlook on the Markets", "selftext": "Listen up retards.\n\nLast week I threw up a technical post for y'all with a headline of sell your puts and buy calls. I got a lot of disagreement and have still had comments on the post as of this morning talking about the technicals of the post and how I'm wrong.\n\nTo recap: I noted in the post a support level of 303 which is where a lot of the flack came from and also showed the inexperience of a lot of traders here because 3030 is the SPX support line which is what I track and 300 is the support line for SPY. Most of the comments ACTUALLY THOUGHT 303 was SPY resistance level. Support levels arent hokus pokus and anyone with an account over 2000$ knows this. Had you sold your puts near the time of my post you would have had max profit and if you bought calls...well...you saw the massive green dildo to 308 that followed the next morning. Sorry for your loss if you missed out.\n\nIn case you haven't noticed, we are not going to plunge beyond that 300 SPY 303 SPX mark as we have been trading around it for a couple days now. We might dance +/- a couple points, but we ain't plunging. This is the bottom. Your puts will be bleed if you continue down the same path.\n\nSecond Wave - Not going to happen. Consensus is already that we will just have to work through it and that at some point in time everyone will be exposed. \n\nElection - Open Republican support for Biden because he's part of the problem = not a big deal if Trump loses because Biden he's one of them.\n\nUnemployment- Get's better by the day.\n\nAsk your wife and mom for more allowance and buy calls.\n\nTldr: SPY September 323C\n\nPositions - FMCIW, FMCC, FNMA, LAZYW, XLF 30$ 9/18C and theta gang puts", "created_utc": 1592232813.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h9hvri/outlook_on_the_markets/", "is_self": true}
