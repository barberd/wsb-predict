He said Taiwan Semiconductor atleast 10 times during this lecture so I decided to look around on this stock. It just so happens I work in IC design as well and I know a decent amount about IC fabrication facilities, and they all have crazy high profit margins. This company is trade war agnostic, it is publicly playing both sides as it provides fabrication for companies in China and the US and neither side really cares. \n\nNow there\u2019s a lot of talks about Apple beginning to make proprietary CPUs which will most likely be made by TSMC no matter how much Tim Apple says he loves America because all American fabrication houses suck. All you meme boys love betting on AMD but I say we should infiltrate the source and find the supplier. \n\nRight now 60c with 1/17/2020 expiry (one day after their earnings) are very cheap and the premium is basically nothing.\n\nTL;DR ALL IN ON 60c 01/17/2020 EXPIRY", "created_utc": 1573697902, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dw2noe/tsm_is_free_money/", "is_self": true}
