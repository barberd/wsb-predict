I\u2019m trying to understand why this happens at as fundamental a level as possible. \n\nNET in particular had me quite confused. I lost money on holding through earnings cause of day trading rules, but I accept the losses. What I don\u2019t get tho is why it tanked. If the market is forward looking, and it seemed to be what with the bull run we\u2019re seemingly in, then CloudFlare seemed pretty poised to make a killing. They\u2019re a major cloud provider and have a hell of a resume, yet they tanked. Why? Of course NET isn\u2019t the only company which this happened to. I\u2019m sure others can recount similar stories. \n\nSo to the mildly less retarded among us, I ask you, what are some reasons this happens? Are there red flags to warn one that a stock is likely to tank post earnings even if it does well?", "created_utc": 1589139235.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gh7vi3/why_have_some_companies_stocks_tanked_despite/", "is_self": true}
