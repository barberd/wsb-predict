Hold Forever (let them roll-off at maturity, but the Treasury will have to pay the interest and principal to the Fed that then pays it back to the treasury, until maturity, unless they decide to forgive the debt, which I thought the Japanese would have done to their Central Bank by now);\n2. Monetize the debt by creating inflation (which they have been doing for decades, the CPI does not fully reflect the true inflation rate, which has been double or triple what the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports, this gives them the luxury of printing more money, but with no real effect on real GDP or wages or standards of living; and\n3. slowly or quickly unloading the securities into the market under a QT-Quantitative Tightening scenario, which they did twice over the past decade (2016/2018) and the markets convulsed and corrected quickly after facing liquidity issues.\n\nThese are all Unorthodox Monetary Policy responses (as we have discussed), under game theory we are in a Prisoners Dilemma, with no real winners at the end of the race.\"", "created_utc": 1587069415.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2n3dl/fed_how_much_longer_can_they_go/", "is_self": true}
