If this isn\u2019t a sign, I don\u2019t know what fucking is. \n\nWhile 99% of us will be lonely as fuck tomorrow because our gfs and wives have left us bc they think we\u2019re talking about McDonald\u2019s everytime we say tendies, there is still hope. \n\nI\u2019ve got the perfect date for everyone.\n\nNo you lonely fuck, not an actual date. It\u2019s 2/14. DID YOU HEAR ME? TWO MOTHER FUCKING FOURTEEN.  We must buy every fucking $214 2/14 call in the god damn market and sell by EOD.\n\nWhat stock you ask? After some masterful due diligence I\u2019ve identified two stocks that fit the memo perfectly, both which symbolize love in more ways than we can even imagine. \n\nFirst off, Estee fuckin Lauder, I bet she was hot. Hovering right around 214 begging for that dick. I\u2019m gay so I won\u2019t give it, but I know there\u2019s some closet straights in here. \n\nOh how does Est\u00e9e Lauder symbolize love you ask? Imagine your ex gf/wife without make up. Yeah now I bet you\u2019re happy she left. \n\nNext on the list is face fuckin book. This shit tickled 214 today and has all the makings of an orgy stock for tomorrow. \n\nWhat\u2019s an orgy stock? 2.5 billion fucking normies sliding into each other\u2019s DMs trying to get that pipe. They also got some bullshit dating integration, idk tinder tendies tits let\u2019s fucking get it boys", "created_utc": 1581642402, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3kbn4/do_you_believe_in_love/", "is_self": true}
