I bought puts last week to take advantage of this special breed of retard. People are still continuing to buy even after the company announced that they expect stockholders to lose all their money. \n\nToday I come home from work and my girlfriend casually mentions that she bought some Hertz today and it finally dawned on me why this market is so retarded. The retard strength of new investors is so strong because they buy the fucking dip without 30 seconds of research. My balls are dry and my puts are fucked. I\u2019ve been a \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b for almost 10 hours now and I already regret it. \n\nHTZ 6/19 $1p\nSPY 7/15 $314p", "created_utc": 1592281480.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h9wijq/the_retard_strength_of_hertz/", "is_self": true}
