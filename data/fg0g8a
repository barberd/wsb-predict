{"id": "fg0g8a", "title": "Calculating payoffs on high IV puts", "selftext": "I am having the hardest time calculating which strike price to pick when buying a put to account for two different scenarios *at the same time*: 1) the stock price decreases significantly (i.e. 20-30%) and 2) the stock price gets clobbered completely.  Example with DIS below.  \n\n[https://i.imgur.com/YeP1Yzr.png](https://i.imgur.com/YeP1Yzr.png)\n\nLet's say we are only considering April monthly puts.  Buying power is constant.  For the ease of calculation, I am also assuming that I will buy strictly at the ask price and will NOT get paid for time value at the time of the sale (which means the profit will be purely from the put being ITM).  The risk is the same in all scenarios (willing to lose everything but get max profit in case of \"win\").  Even after making all these simplifications, there is still no one answer as to which strike price is profitable.  \n\nIs this normal?  Is it possible that the ask prices are just not following a consistent pattern, hence the lack of the \"most profitable\" option.  Are there formulas or tools that can help get better clarity on this?\n\nI believe this will benefit both newbies and people with average experience.", "created_utc": 1583782868, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fg0g8a/calculating_payoffs_on_high_iv_puts/", "is_self": true}
