It simply does not make sense to have a majority of the country indoors when you can isolate the at risk pretty easily. \n\n\nWhen this information becomes more clear in May, I expect consumers to get less fearful and businesses start going again. And if you are scared about consumer habits, just look at the beaches that reopened, people are itching to get out. You can also look at travel/outdoors subreddits, people want to start doing things again.\n\n\nSo I think travel stocks will bounce back and many are severely undervalued. I started buying Carnival Cruise today, [small cruise ports are reopening in less than a week](https://www.seatrade-cruise.com/news/joint-survey-shows-status-northern-european-cruise-ports) and if they have success then there is no reason why cruises won't be sailing come July.", "created_utc": 1588053943.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9hqqu/travel_stocks_may_come_roaring_back_by_july/", "is_self": true}
