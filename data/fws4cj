Those of you who endured losses, we can learn what you did wrong.\n\nOr maybe it's all gambling and its random. But I like to think there is a method to this madness, albeit a slight one, that can better guide us along our glorious path to massive, massive tendies.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nMy mistakes:\n\n1. Didn't have an exit strategy, and got greedy. I held on too long to my **SPY 4/17 200p** last week. Went from **6k --> 8k --> 4k** before cutting my losses, and I'm glad I cut my losses.\n2. **BA calls** yesterday, I thought it was too late. Yesterday, I saw BA go up a shit ton in the morning, and I didn't buy calls because I thought.. *this is ridiculous, and it won't last. The call I am considering is already up 87%. It's too late.* Well, at EOD that call was up to like 250%, and today it opened up even higher, another 100% gain on top of yesterday's gains. I didn't follow the trend.\n3. **BA calls today.** Remembering how I missed out on SPY calls these last two weeks (because after every consecutive green day I thought *there's no way its gonna be green AGAIN),* this time I decided fuck you I'm not missing out this time. I bought BA calls right at open. **BA 4/9 165c.** Once again, I didn't have an exit strategy or a plan. I figured I'd just ride it for a bit and cash out when I felt like it. \\*\\***4k**\\-->**5.8k**...\\*\\**should have cashed out, but I kept holding...* **--> 1.5k.** Cut my losses and cashed out at 1.5k, and I'm glad I did. When I bought my call, it was up 100%. When I cashed out, it was up 50%. Later in the day it went down to -60%. I coulda been wiped out, but I'm still in the game, and even though I lost a shit ton I am grateful I'm not liquidated.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**TL;DR: 6k-->1.5k from holding too long and buying at the wrong days/times for SPY 4/17 200p and BA 4/9 265c.**\n\n**What are your gains, and what was your process/thought process behind those positions?**", "created_utc": 1586291603.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fws4cj/gainslosses_mass_thread/", "is_self": true}
