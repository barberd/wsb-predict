Beat last two earnings by 21 and 45%, next ER is Nov. 14.\n\nWow subs were down to 1.5mm, and they still beat earnings, and they just upped the sub count through wow classic to 5mm+ @ $15/mo that's over $50mm/mo more revenue on the biggest property the company has, and they were already beating ER every quarter.\n\nNext month they launch the most anticipated COD game in years, and are expected to announce Diablo 4, a new WoW expansion, and possibly overwatch 2 at Blizzcon on Nov 3rd.\n\nIf I could afford it, I would go all in with leverage on ATVI.\n\nI know you're not the type for options, but this could be a strong equity play as well, since the current price is so far below what it's typical valuation is, and even if they miss earnings (they won't), the Blizzcon news on Nov 3 will at worst keep them even.", "created_utc": 1568735930, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d5j0et/atvi_1115/", "is_self": true}
