It is a major annoyance and inconvenience because in this day and age if you want something you will research it, not watch ads. I have a growing Excel spreadsheet. \n\nSome PUT ideas along the lines of the subject to stay relevant to sub. \n\n$FUJHY $5 short. \n$CLX 6/5 $100 PUT\n$WU 6/19 $10 PUT\n\n\nPlease post more idears.", "created_utc": 1590731876.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gsn4gp/anyone_oppositely_impacted_by_advertisements_put/", "is_self": true}
