Usually has 16,000 trucks in the port, that's down by half.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou think shit is real but things should get back normal in Mid March and china should be pumping those industrial goods now? Dead Wrong.\n\nChina could only make low to semi mid tier tech grade items, since factories are reopen back around Early March they could still use those stored inventory from Jan. But if you want to assemble an more high tech stuff like Iphone you would need parts from at least from Germany,Switzerland, Japan, US and Chinese components take a look at the pic to get an idea [here](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GN0t3RvvmWfWdoHYlgJGEe0c-ys=/2000x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Lifewire_Where_Is_The_Iphone_Made_1999503_V2-345d781fed0b48909b2fc5c6b52ff325.png) , but factories from everywhere is closing/got infected/needs quarantine at an unprecedented rate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nJapan Has shut down its F35 factory in Mar 4 (An italy factory also shutdown too) [here](https://www.defenseone.com/business/2020/03/f-35-factory-japan-shuts-down-amid-coronavirus-outbreak/163505/)\n\nKorea car factory shut down [here](https://pulsenews.co.kr/view.php?sc=30800028&year=2020&no=222523)\n\nSamsung Wants to move its factories to Vietnam for making parts for its smartphone, but it turns out that A London-Hanoi flight has caused the beer virus to spread in Vietnam right now, things are not looking good. [here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-samsung-elec/samsung-to-shift-some-smartphone-production-to-vietnam-due-to-coronavirus-idUSKBN20T10T) and [here](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-08/virus-outbreak-tied-to-london-hanoi-flight-rattles-vietnam)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe last supply chain shock to the globe was from the earthquake that hit Japan in 2011, so most CEOs who wants to cut costs and pump their stock price has already switch to JIT and the earthquake was just a single country shock, and nobody expect a bloody global supply chain collapse since there isn't one before in history.\n\nCurrently most companies across the globe are facing the problem of not having inventory since the Chinese factories shut down in late Jan as most only runs on 15-30 day inventory.\n\nWhile a report says that A total of 78 million Chinese migrant rural workers have already returned to work, accounting for 60% of the total who left for home for the Chinese New Year holiday [here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-workers/china-says-78-million-migrant-rural-workers-have-returned-to-work-idUSKBN20U0A0).\n\nBut Chinese companies are still mostly producing from inventory left from Jan, as they just open back their factories and ordering new supplies would take at least one weeks for factories and Hubei is still in shutdown, there are also reports about reopening factories but no one is working and they just turn on the equipment as to satisfy the electricity quotas set by the officials [here](https://www.zerohedge.com/economics/lights-are-no-ones-working-how-china-faking-coronavirus-recovery)\n\nPeople with beer virus suddenly falls down and the factory got shut down [vid](https://twitter.com/SYC999/status/1236072794473074690)\n\nI predict that China may get back to 50% production capacity for things that doesn't need external exports in late March - Early April.\n\nDid I even talk about the second wave of disruption coming to Chinese factories? [here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-factories/chinas-factories-at-risk-of-double-whammy-as-coronavirus-hits-south-korea-japan-idUSKBN20P21I)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, you may say Shit is bad but those air freight could transport shit to other countries fast, right?\n\nMaybe, the air freight market is now being infected with WSB virus and the price is as volatile as the VIX index, the price also seems to be doubled. [pic here](https://theloadstar.com/wp-content/uploads/china-ustac.png)\n\nAlso, Sea freights which consists of 90% of global freight trade would take like a month for transporting stuff.\n\nMost factories in Europe and US would wait to April - early May (which they are mostly run out of inventory for 1-3 months) for Cargo ship to arrive to the ports, and they could finally get their long waited inventory. Cheers Right? No Again\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso,Remember there is no more spaghetti due to lock down?\n\nWuhan is still in lock down since late Jan and still haven't been reopen yet.\n\nLet's assume that things are better in Italy and it would take a month to reopen back, but what would happen to nearby regions and countries like in southern Italy,Germany, France,Switzerland? If the rate of increase continues as the expected projection, it seems that they would also be in lock down and those lock down would never could be as effective as in china.\n\nSo even northern Italy reopens in a month it would still impossible to reopen business since other nearby regions would be likely in their own lock down as well.\n\nThis is due to the fact the virus spread faster than any flu virus we have seen before which is at around 2.2-2.68 rate, this is higher than the h1n1 flu of 1.46, and the beer virus is likely more deadly as the Spanish Flu (but maybe due to much higher old population than any time in history), you could look about the comparison [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Notable_flu_pandemics) (thanks for the covid dd post)\n\nThis is like an endless feedback loop and until a cure or a vaccine comes out(which should take more than a year), things would mostly get worse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConclusion:\n\nSo you could see how bad the supply chain problem is , the collapse of the supply chain would cause many business to shut down and debts defaults for both consumer and businesses.\n\nEurope and Japan are already in negative rates, they are already not profitable and lower rates would likely to cause the banks unable to profit from business services and cause a financial collapse again.\n\nYou could see my other DD post talking the liquidity problem , if you are interested on supply chain problems you could follow [r/supplychain](https://www.reddit.com/r/supplychain/) for further updates (Both posts are attached below at the resources part)\n\nI think I'm done writing DD posts for a while, I write this because there ins't much about supply chains discussion on WSB, but I think my 2 DD should give a whole picture on what problems we are facing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:  [hey\\_ross](https://www.reddit.com/user/hey_ross/) says about the shale oil debt is gonna explode due to the amount of debt, which is true:\n\nA.because the supply chains are collapsing and factories/China won't need that much oil, two months for like 50% drop of oil demand could already lower the oil price ;\n\nB.The shale oil industry just got 911 by the Russians and the Saudis and they are unable to be break even below 50, now the price is just 30 so a 40% decline of revenue for those shale oil companies  [pic](https://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2019/~/media/Images/research/economics/2019/0521/0521c1.png)\n\nC. Shale oil was already having problems since 2018 and has around 200 billion debts.\n\nAs of the end of 2018, so this number is a little bit old, we\u2019ve spent about $1 trillion in U.S. oil shale and we\u2019ve returned about $700 billion to the companies in the form of cash flow for a whopping, negative 38% cash-on-cash return,  The total return to shareholders in the sector in the last decade was effectively zero [here](http://www.startribune.com/schafer-shale-oil-passed-its-peak-without-making-money/567884742/)\n\nEdit 2: Someone says the fundamentals remain and my post is just fear.\n\nThe Fundamentals as of now are Northern Italy just got quarantine with a 14 mil population,Industries are stopping and labour,materials could not flow freely.\n\nThe Industrial Triangle of Italy just got quarantine,The quarantine will take over the Italian economic zones. About a third of the national gross domestic product (GDP) comes from the regions of Lombardy and Veneto. According to the financial service company Moody's, Italy's GDP will decrease by 0.5 percent this year.

You can't because nobody knows. The Fundamentals just got changed until it resumes to normal where labor/materials could flow freely again and thus volatility will remain which is bad for business.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nResource Section:\n\nThe Supply chain article in last week: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fbpiqa/it\\_seems\\_supply\\_chains\\_for\\_many\\_companies\\_are/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fbpiqa/it_seems_supply_chains_for_many_companies_are/)\n\nEmpty Ports:\n\n[https://www.portandterminal.com/watch-longshoreman-at-port-of-los-angeles-posts-updates-as-it-grinds-to-a-halt/](https://www.portandterminal.com/watch-longshoreman-at-port-of-los-angeles-posts-updates-as-it-grinds-to-a-halt/)\n\nWhere Is the iPhone Made?:\n\n[https://www.lifewire.com/where-is-the-iphone-made-1999503](https://www.lifewire.com/where-is-the-iphone-made-1999503)\n\nVolatile market sparks call for review of how air freight capacity is traded:\n\n[https://theloadstar.com/volatile-market-sparks-call-for-review-of-how-air-freight-capacity-is-traded/](https://theloadstar.com/volatile-market-sparks-call-for-review-of-how-air-freight-capacity-is-traded/)\n\nFreight transport:\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freight\\_transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freight_transport)\n\nMy post about the potential outcome:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fezfqi/the\\_ultimate\\_collapse\\_of\\_the\\_modern\\_financial/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fezfqi/the_ultimate_collapse_of_the_modern_financial/)\n\n[r/supplychain](https://www.reddit.com/r/supplychain/) Status Update:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/supplychain/comments/few230/covid19\\_update\\_saturday\\_7th\\_march/](https://www.reddit.com/r/supplychain/comments/few230/covid19_update_saturday_7th_march/)\n\nBreakeven Oil Prices Underscore Shale\u2019s Impact on the Market:\n\n[https://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2019/0521](https://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2019/0521)\n\nMusic I'm listening while writing this mess: [some weird music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT_lNTvp1a4)", "created_utc": 1583723956.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffodk3/supply_chains_are_collapsing/", "is_self": true}
