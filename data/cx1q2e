Has low volume in options, but seems like there's starting to be open interest past few days and ex: the november $2.50 call jumped from $0.08 to over $0.20 today already with last sale being $0.15. \n\nHaven't bought any yet, but wondering if it's worth it for tendies before missing it on the low before the merger completes.", "created_utc": 1567089176, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cx1q2e/gemp_novjan_calls/", "is_self": true}
