Had already burned my day trades because I'm retarded. This morning margin call on the account for balance below 25k. Called up TD. They were like \"no problem bro, you get 3 resets a year!\"\n\nSo tomorrow my number resets... and I can do it two more times in the year. Crazy. \n\nTD is my broker, but I bet it applies to others as well. Something else. No one says you can't have 2 accounts with different brokers, double your day trade capacity if you don't have 25k in account.\n\nGood luck out there.\n\nUSO 5/22 3.5P", "created_utc": 1587592949.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6ag3e/psa_dont_fear_the_pattern_day_trader_designation/", "is_self": true}
