The gappers are random they need to be researched and a bias formed and a plan put together but the news (if it has any) whether it's a PR or an SEC filling may or may not be deceiving only the people who are very familiar with that stock will know or should know. Then you have chatroom pumpers and the Level 2 spoofers plus let's not forget the market makers.. and the companies themselves who may just be trying to raise funds with an offering on the shelf ready for unsuspecting punters, or not! maybe it looks bad but goes to the moon anyway who knows right? or it goes to the moon just because it's bad but turns into a short squeeze.. \\\\0/!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is HARD work day in day out. Options or futures are still vulnerable to these shenanigans and different points of view because they are based on the underlying security.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, when I said I think I've found an easier way I don't mean I actually invented it I should have said I see a better way IMHO. Trade just 500 of the worlds best companies or more precisely one ETF the $SPY - but indirectly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf your sole focus was the SPY then by definition your expertise on it would build up by the day instead of starting from zero each morning. Can the SPY be manipulated.. nah it does 300M in volume a day some times. But the SPY is expensive and some time does not move much which is why I say 'indirectly' the UVXY ETF is $12 and mirrors the SPY candle for candle but inverse and moves 3x the SPY great for when the SPY is having a pull back or the much predicted correction.. then there is the TQQQ ETF for longing the SPY on up days which is also 3x but one third the price at $100. I've never been a fan of indicators but have to say they seem to work better on the SPY the SPY is predictable or should I say more predictable than random stocks. Yea you can trade the SPY with options &amp; futures contracts or e-minis with their strike prices and 'Greeks' whatever that means, and they have limited liability but I'm just a simple day trader and I have hard stops I don't want to be boxed in by the CME Group.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nObviously I'm one of many to arrive at the same idea would love to hear from others who have tried it think it's bollocks or love it, or could refine it in some way have I missed a trick here?", "created_utc": 1579950856, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/etple9/pretty_sure_you_guys_are_goner_laugh_but_here/", "is_self": true}
