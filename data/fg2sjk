Haven\u2019t had a good tease like that since the Internet dial-up era. Definitely planned on trading in some tendies for a fresh pair of new boots to scoot in, butt say la vee.\n\nButt it\u2019s time to look ahead and capitalize on the question we\u2019ve all be asking: \u201cWhat hasn\u2019t been priced in yet?\u201d Well, I had some time to think after that double double, extra cheese. The writing was on the wall...literally. I was in the bathroom stall at work and someone had carved \u201c judgement day 03/09/2030\u201d into the door. A little cynical, I admit,  butt what if...\n\nThe revelation hit me like a ton of shitting bricks: the next recession isn\u2019t priced in...like at all. Oh, that gave me chills.\n\nGod, I felt so stupid. Here I was placing orders for same-day trades. Orders that were never executed. Why? Some people say it was the circus breaker. Others said it was the daylight cost avoidance. Personally, I think it was destiny. The universe\u2019s way of telling us that we are called to greater heights...and Robinhood is our guardian angle. Sure, we could take our prophets now...the easy way out. Or, we could invest in a sense of pride and accomplishment and set our sights on the distant future: 2030. \n\nAdmittedly, I don\u2019t know what judgement day will consist of. I\u2019m not a profit. Maybe it\u2019s WW3 in full effect or maybe it\u2019s just every \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b measuring dick sizes in a community circle. Butt I do know that whatever happens, it\u2019s going to spin the global economy into another recession. And you can quote me on that. \n\nSo how do real guys realize real gains? We target the tiggers (MSFT, SPY, TQQQ, etc) that are going to be most affected by a widespread catasstrophy. How will we execute? Well, this is where the plan really shines. We continue doing what we\u2019re already doing butt...butt...we extend our expiry dates into 2030. See, Robinhood has built a state of the ark trading platform that doesn\u2019t. \n\nleverage machine learning but instead maximizes human error. Butt before you send a nasty email to support, understand that in doing so, it\u2019s harder for Skynet to control if the programming logic isn\u2019t written correctly. (look up a one \u201cKyle Reese\u201d on LinkedIn. Robinhood programmer. Coincidence. I think not).\n\n\nIf the restroom Banksy is accurate, and we do experience a global event, the market will undoubtedly once again experience elevated hypo-elasticity reversal. You can expect the same exact shit to occur. Stocks going up and down, up and down, every goddamn day. Butt we shan\u2019t worry, cause we will have been sitting on SPY $300 puts for ten years. Time decay my ass.\n\nSo here are my positions so I don\u2019t get banned.\n\nMSFT $2,030 p 04/09/30\n\nAMZN $1.50 p 4/17/30\n\nHOOD $556 c 3/08/30 (trust me)\n\nTLT $101 c 5/18/30\n\nAMD $0.0009 p 4/09/30\n\nSPY $300 p 6/17/30\n\nAdditionally, TSLA is trading at $7 in Muskcoin (crypto)\n\nAgain, the beauty of this plan is that you don\u2019t have to change shit in terms of your day to day trades. Just choose the option that ends in 30 not 20 and Robinhood will take care of the rest. Just sit back and relax and sometime between now and 2030, Robinhood will execute your orders, you impatient fucks. \n\nKeep your head up, champ. You\u2019ll get the next recession.", "created_utc": 1583791378.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fg2sjk/some_words_of_encouragement_for_those_forced_to/", "is_self": true}
