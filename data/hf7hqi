It\u2019s the Ferrari of at home fitness.  Many things going for it.\n\n1)  It has been claimed that the acceleration of business caused by corona has increased the profit margins to the pre covid 2022-2023 expectations. This is BIG as profit margins were 1 of 2 legitimate concerns for the company.  Not anymore.\n\n2)  Subscriptions are key.  >70% of their free trial subscriptions turn into paying members.  The subscriptions also offer a shit ton of workouts and classes, some live.  The first live class had 23,000 attendees!  Massive.  Currently ~2mil subscribers.  They believe the market share can reach over 50mil \u2014 again I\u2019ll emphasize, they are a young company but recognized as top of class. They will capture a lot of this market.\n\n3)  The Peleton sub reddit is increasing like crazy.  These people are becoming a community.\n\n4)  Sales will continue as corona makes a comeback.  I expect it to steam roll into 2021 \u2014 until a vaccine is here and people are going to gyms care free again.  Even then I think Peleton hangs around for many reasons.\n\n5)  The second concern is the price of their products.  Well guess what, the people buying these products aren\u2019t the type in job positions where they will lose income due to corona \u2014 as evidence of the recent incredible rally.  Also, they are in the process of creating lower priced products anyway.\n\n6)  Look at today!  Everyone is taking profits from everything!  But PTON is going up.  The smart money is sticking around because they know this stock isn\u2019t done running.  The relative strength and advancing positive volume for PTON, on a large volume broad-market sell off day is critical here.", "created_utc": 1593026542.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hf7hqi/gonna_give_you_pton_before_close/", "is_self": true}
