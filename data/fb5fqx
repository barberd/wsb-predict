{"id": "fb5fqx", "title": "Corona Virus and Political Censorship", "selftext": "Disclaimer: I held my puts expiring 3/6 so I am biased \n\nHowever, the news coming out about the Trump administration (mandatory briefing of CDC members before talking to public, not allowing physicians to test for the virus, not supplying test kits, censorship of infected rates, etc) is highly concerning. \n\nThe fact that the White House is going to such extreme measures makes me believe that the situation is much worse than they\u2019re letting on. This could be to decrease public fear or, more likely (from govs perspective) to stabilize the market. \n\nEither way, the market is a ticking time bomb. The past week we had a correction due to coronavirus fears and today we got dicked by the giant green dildo at close leading people to have more confidence in the market. This is absolute horse shit. The virus isn\u2019t going away, more and more people will become infected - this is a fact. \n\nThe administrations censorship of the reporting or testing of the virus can only go on for so long. More news WILL come out that the infection rates are higher in the US and when it does (because it will) the market will go into an even bigger decline. \n\nThe market WILL NOT gain value when these reports of infection come out, we went down and there haven\u2019t even been that many cases in the US so far. So it\u2019s only a matter of time. \n\nI hope this puts some of you at ease holding your positions into the weekend. Additionally, if you\u2019re optimistic about the market just think how it will react when there are reports or travel restrictions within the US... \n\nTL;DR - gov manipulation is only a short term aid (maybe green next week) but the cases are only increasing and we are going to see a massive pullback within the month of March.", "created_utc": 1582941334, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fb5fqx/corona_virus_and_political_censorship/", "is_self": true}
