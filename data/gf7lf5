{"id": "gf7lf5", "title": "Puts on any pharma working on RNA Vaccine for Covid", "selftext": "I just want to put this out there as food for thought. I believe any company that is searching for an RNA vaccine for COVID is primed to fail miserably. You search for \"Pharmaceutical RNA Vaccine\" and you'll get a bunch of public companies. They all got pumped the last month because government has been approving clinical trials left and right. The implication is that these companies will actually be successful. First of all, pharmaceuticals, as I have learned, all generate value only if they hit milestones. If they dont hit milestones they dont make money. Second. Vaccines dont make money, they are absolute shit as far as revenue goes. Third of all and perhaps the most important bit is that the last time an RNA vaccine was attempted, it killed a whole bunch of kids. That vaccine was for RSV. If you google RSV vaccine you will see that it was also an RNA vaccine. \n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC88889/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_vaccine\n>Currently, there are no RNA vaccines approved for human use. \n\nHere's what I feel you all need to know. COVID19 is a strain of the Corona Viruses. You have all had a corona virus in the past and not even known it because they cause the common cold. They are similar, but not exactly like Rhino Virus, also a cold causing virus. \n\nWhat all these pharma companies are getting funding for and generating hype over is the development of a vaccine for the common cold. If it hasnt happened yet, it sure as hell wont happen in the next 12 - 18 months. \n\n\nSo if you were thinking about being first in line to get the vaccine, don't.\n\nUntil you test the shit out of it. You are likely to run into this:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12725690\n>In general, virus-specific antibodies are considered antiviral and play an important role in the control of virus infections in a number of ways. However, in some instances, the presence of specific antibodies can be beneficial to the virus. This activity is known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of virus infection. The ADE of virus infection is a phenomenon in which virus-specific antibodies enhance the entry of virus, and in some cases the replication of virus, into monocytes/macrophages and granulocytic cells through interaction with Fc and/or complement receptors.\n\nIMHO. The only real treatment is anti-virals, which by there nature should work and why Remdesivir and Hydroxycloroquine could work. But I also feel that plain old DNA vaccines which is what the Flu vaccine is has  a lot more promise. But.... creating a DNA vaccine, which means creating an attenuated (dead or inactive) virus is going to take a long time and so will the testing. \n\nPosition:\n1. PFE 06/20 36P\n2. PFE 09/20 35P\n3.
