{"id": "fe53av", "title": "IV on tourism stonks is absurd, time to flip the switch and sell calls?", "selftext": "What up autists. We all know tourism stonks only go down, but puts are getting pretty expensive. What does that mean? To explain to those who are truly retarded (and not just high functional autistic like the rest of us), how expensive puts are can be measured by their implied volatilty, and IV for most stonks have been going through the fucking roof. For everyone's recent favorite whipping boys CCL and AAL, it's gone from 30s to about 110.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5hm2solp4yk41.png?width=2706&format=png&auto=webp&s=88a9faef8d27133ebe130641e78e490768f40b51\n\nBut, IV crush can be a double ended dildo, so instead of being pegged by holding puts when IV decreases, why not peg the IV back? If you're pretty sure stonks will go down but IV is high, you can *sell calls.* Currently, my favorite whipping boy AAL has 3/20 20 on sale for .33 cents, which means they'd need to go to 20.33 from 16.04 to be not profitable. I mean, AAL *could* moon over 27% in the next 2 weeks, but I doubt it.\n\nGranted, selling calls doesn't have the same 420+% porn of some put buys, but it seems like a good directional bet now that also takes into consideration high IV costs. So what about it? Who's down to get freaky with some double \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b action with me, bear on a stock and on IV?\n\nTLDR: Sell 3/20 AAL 20c?", "created_utc": 1583454662.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fe53av/iv_on_tourism_stonks_is_absurd_time_to_flip_the/", "is_self": true}
