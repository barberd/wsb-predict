{"id": "gno9l4", "title": "How to DD Biopharma and Not Fuck Up", "selftext": "Earnings only come 4 times per year, and most little biotechs don't have any anyway. Problem is, guys like us, we need to lose money to big news at least twice as often. The solution: pharma stocks, where you also get clinical trial read outs, patent litigation, and PDUFA dates on the ol' catalyst calendar. Ready to learn how? For the purpose of annoying all you options traders, I'm going to write this from the perspective of someone going long the equity of a small to mid-cap. Plenty of DD already out there on Abbott and J&J.\n\n**Step 1.** Cash matters. Stay the *fuck* away from anything development stage with a market cap under $150 million. Unless you are YOLO-ing a hundred bucks or whatever, the only thing these plays will do is disappoint you worse than you disappoint your dad. Pharmaceutical research takes hundreds of millions of dollars to bring one small molecule from pre-clinical to market under ideal circumstances. A fucking rat carcinogenicity study can run $8 mil and 3 years. Under-capitalized companies with anything besides stud assets don't get bought, they raise and dilute and rinse and repeat, because there is always dumb money out there willing to bet on the 26th attempt to cure alzheimer's by hitting amyloid, or the next me-too formulation of methylphenidate (now in a pez dispenser!) to treat ADHD. Any dipstick with $15m in capital can get listed on the NASDAQ. I've met a lot of them. Don't give them your money. Look at the clinical development success rates by therapeutic area, published by [BIO](https://www.bio.org/sites/default/files/legacy/bioorg/docs/Clinical%20Development%20Success%20Rates%202006-2015%20-%20BIO,%20Biomedtracker,%20Amplion%202016.pdf) (warning: PDF). Make sure your model discounts back to whatever phase your target's lead candidate is in.\n\n**Step 2.** Look at the actual [patents](http://patft.uspto.gov/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html). The database is free, and reading is easy. You're not looking to do a full FTO analysis here, just see that they actually have some claims that aren't total bullshit. Search the company name in \"assignee name\" then search all the names of the inventors you see listed to make sure they've actually assigned the patents to your target, and that the patents actually cover the drug they're talking about in their press releases. You'd be amazed that sometimes they don't. Check the date of filing/acceptance. If it's still preclinical but has burned ten years of patent life, walk away.\n\nThere are four kinds of patents that matter to pharmaceuticals:\n\n1. Composition of matter - you'll recognize this because the claims will say things like, \"compositions of....\" and \"a compound containing XXXX or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof\". These are the only un-fuck-withable patents you get.\n2. Formulation - this means the molecule is not novel, but the pill, patch, liquid, or suppository is. These can be fine, or they can be sketchy. You need to evaluate the underlying technology. Has it been used before in other drugs? Were there Paragraph IV filings on them? Was the company that licensed this technology to my darling DD target sued along with the manufacturer of that other drug? Any one of these can trip you up. Look for solid technology that hasn't cracked under a lawsuit yet.\n3. Method of use - these patents limit the use of the compound to a specific disease like autism. These are easier to work around, but better than nothing since they give the company a heads-up that generics may be coming (remember that paragraph IV thing I mentioned? It means that the generic makers have to file a lawsuit, followed by an automatic 30-month stay on launching their knock-off.) If all your target has is methods of use, tread cautiously.\n4. Method of manufacture - these are worthless.\n5. Other kinds of regulatory exclusivity. Yeah I said 4. This is different, but can still matter. Deal. Orphan Drug (7 years), New Chemical Entity (5 years), QIDP (5 years but just applies to antibiotics, which don't make money), Rare Pediatric Disease (accelerated review voucher, worth $50-100m if sold), Clinical Trial Data (3 years)\n\n**Step 3.** Look at the epidemiology - If your target company has the cure for some ultra-weird orphan disease, so what? Is there a patient registry? An advocacy group full of sad moms? A celebrity that has it? Are there academic centers treating the population currently? If not how the hell are they supposed to find the patients to charge their insurers $1m a head for this miracle cure? Also, holy goddamn, $1m a head? Is management prepared to get hauled in front of Congress to wither under national media scrutiny for weeks on end because people don't understand that nobody would develop drugs for a disease with 500 patients if they didn't make money? Pray they get bought by Alexion or move along.\n\nIf it's not an orphan disease, what are the insurers going to pay for it? New antibiotics, for example,  are worthless commercial investments, because hospitals will reserve them for the absolute worst-case, dumpster fire, probably going to die anyway patients and give everyone else a z-pack or generic iv rocephin all day long. Find out what the cheapest thing to treat your target company's disease of choice is and then scour the conference call transcripts for how in the name of bleeding Jesus they're going to get those tight-fisted bastards at United Health and Blue Cross to pay for it. Gross-to-Net deductions of 50% are the **low end of normal** now that there are 2-3 wholesalers and maybe ten insurers that matter nationally. Make sure you're discounting your projected cash flows appropriately.\n\n**Step 4.** Now, and only now, do you even bother to see what the rest of the company looks like. Are they in Phase 2? Data reading out this year? Great. A phase 3 trial costs at minimum, $10,000 per patient per week. Double that if it's an inpatient study, or being done against an expensive standard of care (like in cancer, where you can't use placebo because *ethics*.) Companies will often not tell you what these trials will cost, but you can find out. Look at the current market leading drug's label [here](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/) and find section 14 (Clinical Trials Experience). This will tell you the number of patients and how long the study ran. Regulatory affairs people like precedents, as does the FDA, so it's a good bet that your target's Phase three trials will look a lot like this. Do the multiplication, and decide if that number plus their burn rate of the past 24 months less R&D expense is > cash on hand.\n\n**Step 5.** The Target Product Profile. Odds are, your prospective acquisition has talked up the benefits of their darling compound, and completely downplayed the side effects. Look at the available clinical trial results with a jaundiced eye. Pharma reps, when visiting doctors tend to show them an i-pad and say, *big bar good, little bar bad* and leave it there. Because they're also buying lunch for the office and wearing a low-cut top, the 'scripts get written. We aren't going to fall for that though, are we? Was there a dose-proportional response in their target efficacy endpoint? Was the p value at the 5th decimal place, or did they barely squeak by at p= 0.0499? What about the discontinuation rate? How does it compare to the current standard of care? All this feeds back to the number one question analysts should be asking management; \"How will you get insurers to pay for this?\" If there's not a clear separation on efficacy versus the prior standard, or a reduction by at least 50% in a really gnarly side effect, expect the commercial launch to be a slog.\n\n**Step 6**. The pipeline. Is your target going to continue to exist after Phase 3 is over, or is their plan to get bought? Look at management. Is there anyone with commercial experience on the executive team? Is there a head of sales? Marketing? Look for clues as to whether they're really cut out for this. Did big pharma (Pfizer or Genentech) license something deeper down in their pipeline, back at Phase 1 or before? That means multiple someones with budgets in the billions, access to a diligence database full of every document about the compound, and had the company's management on speed dial for months... passed on buying the thing that's in Phase 2/3 now.\n\n**Step 7.** The exit. Let's say all this has lined up, and you've found a company that's got the goods, with solid data in a real market, ironclad patents, enough capital to cover the next 23 months, and a share price that's not yet north of 200x projected earnings. (Even still, do not let this little bastard become more than 10% of your overall sector exposure.) What's your exit catalyst? If you're betting on an acquisition, look at the big boys in that therapeutic area and see whether there are any where this drug actually fits. Just because Roche or Ferring has \"women's health\" drugs, does not mean they're going to buy Sprout. The former are in reproductive endocrinology (maybe 2,000 doctors) and the latter has a lead asset in sexual dysfunction ( that's primary care, psychiatry, and OB-GYN, 250,000 doctors at the low end.) Roche isn't going to build that sales force. Is there actually a strategic acquirer or licensee that makes sense?\n\nIf not, is there anyone on your target's management team who has commercialized drugs before? Is there a sales & marketing staff? If not, is there the cash on hand to create or rent one? If you know these things before you click \"buy\" you might just not fuck up.", "created_utc": 1590027208.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gno9l4/how_to_dd_biopharma_and_not_fuck_up/", "is_self": true}
