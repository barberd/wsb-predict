A Second Lockdown", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nWe're all making bets as to whether the market will decide to go further up from here in the next month, or we will re-trace the lows. We are reading tea leaves, making and mocking TA, or at least looking at the data we think will be predictive and instructive... Or just guessing. \n\n**What I think we're missing is the looming hammer of a second lockdown**, **sooner** (with states re-opening *this week*) **or later** (with a serious resurgence this winter, or a mutated new strain of virus anytime). \n\nThere's plenty of effort being made to measure the 'true rates of infection' and using this data as a means to estimate when it's safe for us to come out of the bunkers; the problem is that we don't know:\n\n1) The true number of people infected so far and their survival rates (the \"prevalence\" and \"mortality\"), discussed in the article below; it's doubtful we're even able to measure these accurately anyhow. \\[Sub-point here: the \"incidence\", the number of new infections we have measured so far, has been *during lockdown*. What happens to the incidence when lockdown ends?\\]\n\n2) The potential for re-infection (once you are immune, does it last?)\n\n3) The potential for a new strain of virus (influenza presents with a new strain every year, requiring a new vaccine every year)\n\nWhat we do know is that there is not going to be a miracle cure - not hydroxychloroquine or any other  already-known drugs (I have a PhD in centered on drug development; fight me!) - and there won't be a vaccine developed *and* approved *and* mass-produced *and* mass-distributed for a very long time. There has been no coordinated federal response, and America is [full of idiots](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-24/anti-vaccine-activists-latch-onto-coronavirus-to-bolster-their-movement) who feel oppressed by keeping others safe. Another lockdown is coming.\n\n**TL;DR:** I posit 90% chance of re-lockdown(s); even if it's on/off and only regional, it'll be in the most economically relevant areas like LA and NY (as opposed to Yeeee-Haw, South Dakota), and this will crush the market.\n\n**Strategy (listen ding dongs):** \n\nAre you a bear waiting on a drop? Minimize your theta bleeding, make little plays but be ready for when the hammer drops.\n\nAre you a bull watching the market go back to normal? Wondering what could crush an unlimited printer and even hurt the stay-home stocks?
