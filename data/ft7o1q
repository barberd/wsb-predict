{"id": "ft7o1q", "title": "Aggressive Options -- CCL,BAC,F,MOMO,ET", "selftext": "Today I included the aggressive orders, watch tomorrow which of these orders go into OI then you can tell which of these are sitting open.\n\nThese options orders are on or above the ask. Many have the same expiry and strike. Also lots of the orders were sweeps so these ppl were   breaking down their order to get filled faster.\n\nHere - [https://imgur.com/a/Nr5XB8q](https://imgur.com/a/Nr5XB8q)\n\nAlso   all these orders volume of the contracts exceeded the open interest    in  multiple trades so it's most likely not closing positions. Either    buy  to open orders or sell to open orders and based on the       aggressiveness  of the orders one can infer its buy to open.  Some of   these may be  hedges and some most likely not.\n\nYesterday I posted about BAC , CCL, and others. CCL closed down 33% and the flow yesterday bet on a drop so I would say this move in CCL has already been made so all of you would be late, the same for BAC. I don't know what VEEV does enough to give an opinion. I am interested in those GILD calls from yesterday still here, I haven't had time to check if those orders went into OI. -- [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fsom2h/aggressive\\_options\\_baccclgildmgmtsla/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fsom2h/aggressive_options_baccclgildmgmtsla/)\n\nDon't    just  enter YOLO's in positions based on this data alone in most  cases.   Use   technicals/fundamentals/options data/market feelings all  combined    instead of just 1 of these.   Use protection like spreads if  you worry    about losing what u put in and be  smart, understand the  risks of  putting $ into weekly expiry's, consider a longer expiry.  Learn IV AND IV CRUSH!!\n\nAlso with the market going lower use technicals/fundamentals/options  data-flow all combined.\n\nEDIT     - Wanted to add, I make these posts a lot with different tickers,   when  I  am most confident I make a whole thread for one ticker. Like I   did  in  the past with MSFT/AAPL/TSLA/DIS, I am saying this because I   have   different levels of confidence the orders will work out. These   orders   today are aggressive but not super super aggressive. So the   confidence   level is lower than something extremely aggressive and   unusual like SBUX order flow I posted about in the past.\n\nEDIT    - We are in uncertain times so these orders have less of an impact.  Technicals say there is more room to fall in the indexes so most    companies should follow.", "created_utc": 1585772076.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ft7o1q/aggressive_options_cclbacfmomoet/", "is_self": true}
