{"id": "big5sy", "title": "Question About Selling Puts", "selftext": "Hello Friends,\n\nI\u2019ve never sold Puts before, and I have a question about them. I hope you can shed some knowledge &amp; advice.\n\nI previously bought 50 shares of SQ (at $28/ea) and I\u2019m considering buying more shares for the long game. I read [THIS](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/optioninvestor/10/sell-puts-benefit-any-market.asp) \u201cPut Selling In Practice\u201d example, and it seems to me that selling a put for the lowest possible amount is the best thing to do... if you actually want to buy the shares at a later date. Right now selling $18 Puts for SQ on January 2020 is only $0.03 though, and the reported \u201cBreak Even\u201d is $17.97... so I think I\u2019m not understanding something correctly.\n\nQuestion: If I want to buy 100 shares of SQ in January 2020/2021, what would be my best option to place at this time?\n\nThank you for your time &amp; effort helping me better understand this circumstance, and I wish you all the best!", "created_utc": 1556486133, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/big5sy/question_about_selling_puts/", "is_self": true}
