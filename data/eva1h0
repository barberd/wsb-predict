I was thinking of going with a put around $10 out of the money for a Friday expiration but curious on your guys thoughts? Fuckers are definitely expensive but was thinking there could be a nice swing with this Virus shit on top of things.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nOk, I get it. Thanks for the help fellas, I love the criticism on this sub, you guys crack me up. Fuck the Put, I'm going to rock calls for 3 weeks out. I'm trying so hard to get on the Bull train, it's just hard as I got rocked in 2008 but I know it's a different game today then it was back then, just going to be a bull and hedge a bit just in case. I did go short on a lot of China shit so hopefully that works out.. Fucking Tesla, WTF, I got owned on that one..\n\nPS: I did kick some ass on ES and NQ today though so that's going well for me! And to think, I was actually considering going short this morning for about a minute then just jumped on WSB quick to remind me...", "created_utc": 1580239050, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eva1h0/apple_puts_or_calls_before_earnings_news/", "is_self": true}
