But seeing the comments on some of these posts blow my mind. Sure it\u2019s funny to joke about losses and stuff when they happen, but I think we can all agree that making tendies is a lot more fun than losing them. Some people genuinely take/hold terrible positions because they see others doing the same. I really really suggest you guys do your own DD. One of the most important things I\u2019ve learned as a trader is to trade based off of what YOU know.  I know we are all autists here, but to those of you who are genuinely trying to make tendies, I hope you understand what I\u2019m trying to say.\n\nEDIT: And before you tell me to go back to r/investing , Im just trying to look out for the people who genuinely concerned about being down like 50%. That shit is so stressful. When you see other people in the same position, it makes you feel better, but it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a good thing. Just because everyone fails the math test doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a good thing.", "created_utc": 1583354942.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fdjhkl/just_a_genuine_piece_of_advice/", "is_self": true}
