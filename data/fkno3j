Square has also been loaning money to businesses for years. I have a friend who\u2019s restaurant does about 600k a year and square loans him 107k almost every 8-12 months. He\u2019s used this service 3x over the years.\n\nSquare pulls 20%~ or so from each night transactions and puts it towards your \u201cdebt\u201d his loan has to pay atleast 6k every 60 days to remain active on square else they shut down your terminal.\n\nHe like most have DEEP fucking loans via square. Square is the most popular POS system for businesses under 1million dollars revenue. \n\nSquare Toutes 15 million members.
