I realize this is a pOtStoCk, however this stock has some serious catalysts leading into next earnings, get into this red hot rocket now. It's passing the moon and going straight to Uranus in t-90 days. DD below.\n\nHere are the upcoming catalysts for this stock:\n\n# 1) Changing Regulatory landscape\n\nAs COVID-19 changes how legal cannabis can be sold to Canadians, Aphria Inc.'s chief executive thinks the time is right for pot producers to get into the online retail business.  \n\"I want to become what Amazon is to the grocery business,\" Aphria CEO Irwin Simon told BNN Bloomberg in a phone interview last Wednesday.\n\nAs retailers across Canada close their doors to help stop the spread of COVID-19, many cannabis stores have been allowed to sell their products through curbside pickup or delivery services.  \nCannabis producers are already allowed to sell medical cannabis directly to patients, but cannot directly sell recreational pot to customers. Canada's cannabis legislation gives provinces the power to manage recreational pot sales through a variety of patchwork policies that differ from province to province.\n\nIn Maple Syrup land subregion - Ontario, for example, changing the rules on how cannabis can be delivered would require a provincial cabinet order. But, the CEO said by shipping legal cannabis directly to customers, **the company would be able to keep prices low, increase consumption and tax revenue as well as better compete with the illicit market.**\n\nHe added that building out more retail stores in Canada would require more capital, something that cannabis producers and retailers alike are currently struggling to raise amid liquidity constraints in the current fiscal environment. \"With food and hospitality, everything is going to e-commerce,\" Simon said. \"We will be able to go to an e-commerce system where the company's themselves can ship directly to consumers.\"\n\n***Why does this matter?***\n\nDirectly selling to end consumers - higher margins\n\n# 2) Balance Sheet Hygiene\n\n**a) Reduced Debt**\n\nWhile Aphria wasn\u2019t facing any near-term liquidity issue, the company was extremely proactive addressing a weakness in its balance sheet. Aphria issued debt last April, selling US$350 million 5.25% convertible debt in a private placement, with a maturity of 2024. The bonds were convertible at US$9.38, then a 20% premium to the price but, more recently, more than 2X where the stock was trading.\n\nOn Friday, the company announced a deal to repurchase 26% of the debt at a big discount. Specifically, it paid US$2.1 million to cover accrued and unpaid interest and issued 18.7 million shares to retire $90.8 million of the bonds, effectively US$4.84 per share, a 31% premium to its recent closing price. To be clear, the debt holders received stock valued at about $69 million, a discount of 24%.\n\nIn hindsight, the company would have been better off a year ago selling stock rather than issuing convertible debt, but this transaction reduces debt, improves net cash and lowers interest expense. Shareholders didn\u2019t appreciate these benefits initially, as the stock sold off and ended the day down almost 7%. The best explanations of why the stock declined are that the increased share count is seen as dilution (the 18.7 million shares boosted shares outstanding by 7%) and, perhaps more importantly, that most likely a portion of the stock issued hit the market.\n\nI was surprised that debt holders agreed to do the deal, so I reached out to the company to gain a better understanding.\n\nThe bonds had apparently been trading at about sixty-one cents on the dollar, so this transaction enabled the shareholders to exit the bonds at a higher price, effectively. As the bonds are privately traded, pricing data isn\u2019t readily available to the public. For the debt holders to lose, the stock would have to decline to US$2.96.\n\n***So, why is this such a big deal?***\n\n***Improved profitability, net income, balance sheet ratios, and FCF. Basically everything holding down the MJ sector.***\n\n**b) Bigly amount of Cash**\n\nThe company also has about $515 million in cash, a sizable war chest which \"isn't burning a hole in my pocket,\" Simon said, noting he's willing to be patient if any distressed assets were to become available for a potential acquisition.\n\nBasically, when competitors go under \\*cough cough ACB\\*, Aphria is perfectly positioned to vulture in and scavanger pro their shit. Especially proprietary tech in Aurora's extraction firm (RTI) when they take a dirt nap.\n\n# 3) Increased demand due to batsoupflu\n\nHere is a little story I'd like to share:\n\nAphria's shitty competitor: TLRY was expected to post revenues of $50.6 mil per estimate. Prior quarter revenue was $47 Mil appropriately.  \nTLRY beat, with $52.1Mil. So it was good, but not lotion-in-hand-sniffing-your-moms-underwear good.\n\nTheir revenue grew about 10% from the previous quarter. That is not bad but APHA grew 20% revenue for the same period.\n\nNext, **APHA** earnings were for **December, January** and **February** so no COVID-19 impact really.  \n**TLRY** was for **January, February** and **March** and **March was a Covid month.**\n\nTLRY did not give disclose per month revenue but stated that month over month it grew with March being fairly large due to people loading up on product. Then they commented that April was less than March but better than February.\n\nRevenue by month, highest to lowest:\n\n1)March\n\n2)April\n\n3) February\n\n4) January\n\n**What does that mean for APHA since it shits all over TLRY?**\n\nAPHA revenue was $144Mil for the quarter in Canadian $. Safe to assume (supported by marijuana sales figures for the industry) that APHA was stronger in January than December and Stronger in February than January so month over month increases. APHA quarter currently consists of **March, April** and **May**.\n\nBased on numbers available from the Industry and comments from TLRY, we can assume that APHA also had a great March. I verified this by calling every dispensary chain in BC, Alberta, Ontario, and Quebec (Quebec I couldn't understand half of the French fuckers) but talking to these dispensary chains, Aphria's premier brand Broken Coast (top shelf) is the top selling brand and is sold out within hours of replenishment. **THEY LITERALLY CAN'T KEEP IT IN STOCK**.\n\n**Distribution of revenue for APHA last quarter was $44, $48 and $52mil for a total of $144Mil last Quarter.**\n\nTLRY commented that start of May was just fine and sounded to me that they expect May better than April. Let\u2019s assume APHA also does that. After all, month over month growth seems to be standard. So let\u2019s assume $60Mil at least.\n\n**Distribution of revenue for APHA this quarter should be in the neighborhood of $70M, $55M and $60M for a total of $185M this Quarter.**\n\nThis is $36MM (\\~24-25%) higher than analysts expectations per yahoo finance. For APHA, next Q Earnings expectations are:\n\nLow: $136M\n\nHigh: $159M\n\n**Consensus $149M.**\n\nBased on MD&A from Aphria, calling dispensaries, and reviewing the debt-equity transaction, I am betting bigly. I forecasted a 25%-30% earnings beat. This beat, coupled with an exacerbated short % of float, the stock price is blasting right into Uranus.\n\nTL;DR\n\n**Improved revenue streams**\n\n**Impressive Cash Hoard + Balance Sheet improvement**\n\n**Increased Demand for Products**\n\n**China likes bats-pandolin interspecies porn**\n\nDo your own DD, but this stock is primed for a hugely pump next earnings call.\n\nPosition: 57 Contracts - 1/21/2022 $3.50 Calls", "created_utc": 1589476208.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gjqh3z/apha_uranus_bound_in_t_90_days/", "is_self": true}
