{"id": "hird81", "title": "Tesla joining the S&P 500", "selftext": "\\~@Truth\\_Tesla\n\nOne of the biggest S&P 500 additions in history was when Berkshire Hathaway, with a $160b market cap, was added in early 2010.  The inclusion was a surprise, and the headlines were bombastic. \n\nTo put this in perspective: in 2010 about $3.5t in assets were benchmarked to the S&P 500. Today this is $11.2t, as the index rose from \\~1,100 to today's \\~3,000 levels. \n\nWhen BRK.B was added, with an about 1.1% weight in the index, the short term effects on the stock price was immediate, as it rose from \\~$65 to a peak of \\~$83, by +27%.  This was while the S&P 500 dropped by around -6% due to the Euro debt crisis. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6s8txw82w2851.jpg?width=1342&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2990ccb14c091e18d81afd69d31218402a534809\n\nBRK.B also rose despite the float being diluted by about 6%, as new shares were issued.  The undiluted appreciation of BRK.B, relative to the benchmark S&P 500, was probably closer to +35%-40%.   \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1rd9llk8w2851.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=88590f365f5aaf175357ba340e5ee6bcace7bebf\n\nBerkshire Hathaway also missed many opportunities in 2009 and by early 2010 it was considered an under-performing fund.  Now let's compare this with Tesla. TSLA's current valuation is \\~$185b and 80% float, would make it about \\~0.7% of the S&P 500 index. \n\nBut while Tesla's index weight of $185b\\*80% = $148b is comparable to BRK.B's $170b\\*67% = $107b, the amount of global assets potentially carrying TSLA as a benchmark component are not: \n\n\ud83d\udcf7BRK.B: 1.1% of $3.5t = \\~$38b  \n\n\ud83d\udcf7TSLA: 0.7% of $11.2t = \\~$78b \n\nSo the magnitude of possible anti-dilutive portfolio allocations to TSLA - a fair chunk of which have probably already been performed for the largest players - is 2x larger for the TSLA S&P 500 inclusion event than for the Berkshire Hathaway event. \n\nBut there are other differences as well: the inclusion of BRK.B was (presumably...) a surprise - and it happened against the backdrop of a bearish market episode (the Euro debt crisis) when the S&P 500 dropped about 10% from its recent peaks. \n\nIf Tesla manages to post marginal profits in Q2, then its S&P 500 inclusion would happen while big market participants are certainly aware of the possibility - and against a reasonably bullish market backdrop with a dovish Fed and strong stimulus measures in place. \n\nThe million dollar question is, how many of the passive and active funds benchmarked against the S&P 500, in particular smaller and medium size funds, are prepared for the inclusion of Tesla?  Tesla FUD was pervasive for almost a decade and was still formidable this year. \n\nMany of the big funds, such as BlackRock, are currently overweight in TSLA - which suggests either long term growth investment, or a possible intent to sell to market participants who are under pressure to take an equal-weight stake in Tesla. \n\nIf these institutional investors overestimated the appetite of the market for TSLA shares, or if there's a broader bearish market, then we could see a 'sell the news' selloff after S&P 500 inclusion.  OTOH, TSLA's \\~10% short interest is much higher than BRK.B ever was. \n\nIf institutional Tesla shareholders currently overweight in TSLA control the free float supply of TSLA shares after S&P 500 inclusion, then I'd expect them to allow the price to run up & squeeze a few more shorts, so they can collect a well deserved premium. ;)", "created_utc": 1593536652.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hird81/tesla_joining_the_sp_500/", "is_self": true}
