PTON is probably going to see a big spike in sales which at least in the long term is going to give them a boost in recurring revenue from app subs and bike sales from spastic beckies during the virus shutdown. \n\nTL;DR PTON 10/16 $22c", "created_utc": 1584281717.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fj1x5g/autistic_play_of_the_day_pton/", "is_self": true}
