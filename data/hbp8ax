Long ATM premiums are expensive but OTM is fairly cheap. I\u2019m not advocating you to buy tomorrow but if you do, make sure to go 8/21 $310-400c. Literally can\u2019t go tits up.  \n\nTLDR; OP is a retard but...8/21 300-370c for cheap.", "created_utc": 1592521962.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hbp8ax/to_the_retard_who_bought_200k_worth_of_biib_350c/", "is_self": true}
