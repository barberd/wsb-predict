{"id": "ftz3yo", "title": "Let's Share Shorting Ideas", "selftext": "In this difficult market the only thing that made me currently at least break even was my individual stock shorts. I have a lot of SPY puts (around 40, all kinds of strikes and dates, not earlier than May 15, most of them deeply red), and as I was getting sick of losing money I started shorting individual stock names with great success. No worries about IV crush or theta, all you need to pick is direction. Massive volume and narrow spreads on all but the tiniest of tickers. \n\nMy short positions:\n\n\\-1000 CCL - closed today for cool >40% gain, held less than 48 hours. This seems gutted out and not worth holding for little gain.\n\n\\-1200 LVS - average at 47.69, still holding, current profit 15.55%, this POS is still only about 40% down from this year's highs\n\n\\-300 WYNN - average at 80.34, still holding, current profit 34.44%. Still well above recent lows.\n\n\\-2000 MGM - average at 11.42, my only flat short, this wants to go lower I think, still a lot higher than recent lows.\n\nAny of you guys have some good shorting ideas - stocks that have big time downside potential, puts are waaaay too expensive and and would make for a great short?", "created_utc": 1585877817.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ftz3yo/lets_share_shorting_ideas/", "is_self": true}
