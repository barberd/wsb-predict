Laddered up and bought $40k more as the price slipped back down, Junes, Augusts, Sept expirations, at higher strikes ($1.30-$1.70).**\n\nWhat's up m'mans!! It's been a while since I hit you wastoids up with an [update](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fob7fw/froze_oj_futures_call_options_to_the_moon_600/) on my [Frozen OJ trade](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flbinq/l_o_n_g_frozen_concentrate_oj_futures_options/) that very sadly got shat on to everyone's great disadvantage because it was an actually coherent and [rather solid argument](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkyh5i/coronahedge_1_state_prices_nuclear_war_and_frozen/) hidden as a schizopost.\n\n[Here's the results](https://imgur.com/a/FZcDkqK) from my Interactive Brokers trade log. Initial investment 5-6 weeks ago \\~$20k. Realized (sold) returns of $100K, representing about half that original $20k basis (rest expired or will expire worthless). \n\nOf the $100K, took $60k in cash and reinvested in other things (mostly MNOV, which has been my largest holding for 12+ months even before their announcement that ibudilast would be trialed for ARDS + COVID19, [which I did suspect](https://stocktwits.com/_KissMeThruThePhone_) would happen), **but...$40K laddered up with additional $OJ call options.** \n\n**Original thesis just as sound** ***and I think it is even more compelling now:***\n\n1. Reread the original schizopost. All essentially remains true. Do a search for the couple of articles that came out over the past few weeks about Frozen OJ being the bet performing asset class all year, with a 25% gain. We round-tripped on that back down to the current price of $1.05-$1.10 as speculators took profits, etc. Super interesting quote from [one](https://www.ft.com/content/7e28bf45-31b6-46af-a691-28ab930d3127) of the [articles](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-52030133) was from one of the flunkies at some commodity research firm (why didn't you become an actual *trader* instead of a research nerd, again???)...who basically implied \"there is, and never will be, any shortage of frozen OJ\". This is a statement that will obviously be priced in by traders (and has been for the commodity in general over a long period of time).   \n**Here's why he is wrong and in fact CANNOT be right at anything close to the level of certainty that is, in fact, currently priced in. This statement and the general belief behind it is why there remains a substantial opportunity.**  \n***Volatility Regimes***  \nOK review what Implied Volatility is. Ok good glad you did that. IV is why I was comfortable with this trade back in late Feb. IV was super low (25% to low 30s) given the uncertainty in supply chains, possible demand increase, etc. Which means the price of the call options were low. The point was that IV is often based on historical, realized volatility of the underlying. IV is an annualized measure, but when you divide by the square root of the number of trading days in a year, you get the standard deviation of the daily price moves. The options were assuming that 68% of the daily price moves were between 1.5-2%. Which may be true in normal times, **but NOT in COVID times.**\n2. Speculators came in because it was a good \"story\" trade (and the story was plausible), and traded the price up. Shorts were being covered as well. BUT very importantly, the round trip on the price was only 25% or so....i.e., traders got out when they decided 10-25% jump from their entry point was enough...essentially, it represented an assumed price ceiling--\"let me take my profits no way the price is going to run higher than that\". \n3. **This was in fact a good thing** because it implied that the market STILL assumes the chance of a substantial price increase, on the order of 50-100% or more, is of low probability. Sure, maybe given historical price trends and historical price volatility, but if you look back on the historical chart, you'll see the price DOES move, substantially, but only in response to weather events in Florida or Brazil (where 60% of the crop is grown). **It is inconceivable to me that the potential for major supply disruption due to COVID19 is not just as big as a hurricane.** That means the price, **as well as the implied volatility**, should reflect that fact at some probability...which I promise should be higher than the reflected price change since say Jan 1.\n4. But the BIGGEST issue that has surfaced in the past couple weeks since my original thesis I believe is the most important argument for why Frozen OJ remains a killer trade and substantially undervalued both at the price of the underlying commodity **AND from an IV perspective**.   \n***The real-time supply data at the level of producers and marketers now has no historical referent, and thus is effectively useless for those traders who have it.*** Think about it. If there already are disruptions in supply chains (there are), slowdowns in terms of ordering, delivery, and production....people out sick at processing plants...does the fact that supply, inventory, production levels at one level of the chain (which can be measured...and is measured, and taken into account either by AI traders or human ones) mean what it used to mean say 6 months ago? **IT DOES NOT, because the WORLD HAS CHANGED**. A buildup at one level does NOT mean the same as it used to mean, in fact, there is almost no information value associated with it. **EVERYTHING becomes ARTIFACT for an AI or human trader.** Even though they may be paying through the nose for realtime data, **IT GIVES THEM ALMOST NO ADVANTAGE** because things are changing so quickly.   \nand...  \n***The real-time demand data at the level of consumers, retailers ALSO has no historical referent, and thus is effectively useless for those traders who have it.*** Yes, of course it works on the demand side as well! It is well known (look up recent articles especially one in the WSJ about forecasting at grocery stores) that consumers have dramatically changed their purchase behavior, both product wise but also TEMPORALLY. The stores are reporting, still, 3 weeks into this lockdown, that consumers are shopping in waves. I can tell you from a family connection in the fresh produce business, that they had their busiest week in history 3 weeks ago, then two weeks ago it was absolutely DEAD. Then the next week, half their customers reordered massive quantities and the other half cancelled the orders (Safeway) not because they didn't need the produce but because they had trucks lined up outside their Tracy warehouse with not enough labor to unload since people were out sick or taking sick days out of fear. ***This means that just like the producer realtime data, the checkout data has absolutely no real \"information value\"*** for informed traders and AIs to use in their models, which are of course trained by years of experience or tons of market data. Just picture in your head, and think about how precise the level of forecasting and data analysis has gotten over the past few decades for food supply chains...tiny blips were noticed and managed and most importantly **priced in**. But now, all bets are off...if consumers are shopping in waves and the demand over time curve ends up looking more like a sine wave, and the price functional accepts a sine wave as the demand function now and something similarly choppy and volatile as the supply function....**so who the F knows what the price might be!** Certainly not informed traders....in fact, their \"information\" they pay so much for now suddenly might take them down the wrong course. \n\n**The bottom line: the volatility regime has changed dramatically\u2014**all historical data on actual futures price dynamics, on realtime supply and demand data...**everything that under the efficient market theory (lol)** might point to a very limited amount of profits to be made unless you were super informed...none of that matters! Don't' forget that **volatility is not just a measure** it is a **function** of the real-world. The real world on this commodity has changed in ways that no longer can be measured properly....effectively making **story theses** just as valid (maybe moreso) as data-based theses... volatility has now itself become \"stochastic\". And coming off of such a low, historically based volatility, the realized volatility of the past few weeks' runup ($0.95-$1.20 and back) is a joke and makes for a killer buying opportunity given the crazy supply/demand dynamics and the actual, verifiable increase in end consumer demand. \n\nOne last thing...don't ever under-appreciate the effect on price when a product (like bourbon in the past 10 years, or almonds starting 25 years ago) that has seen a slow but inexorable decrease in demand over a long period of time finally hits its inflection point. FCOJ consumption was going down 1-4% a year for decades, hall-monitor doctors telling us \"WAHHH FRUIT JUICE BAD FOR U MAX MAX SUGAR!!!\"....well when people stare the possibility of death in the face, and remember that oh yeah lol OJ tastes great in the morning...and HEY it has vitamin C (the best rationalization you could come up with during a pandemic!!)...I'm gonna live a little!!!....we just hit an inflection point, and demand, even though it will be quite volatile on all short-term measures, will start to see a multiyear, worldwide increase. \n\n# FCOJ. Nontrivial chance of $2+, and at these IVs the trade of a lifetime. Buy the calls unless you know how to trade futures....(I've never traded a future in my life and only own calls).", "created_utc": 1586885696.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g19yuz/frozen_oj_futures_options_trade_update_100k/", "is_self": true}
