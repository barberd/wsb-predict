A 50bp cut on interest rates gave it an erection before the erection decided to become flaccid, like my dick after I see Winker's mum.\n\n10 Year Bond Yield went below 1% for the first time in history. At the time of writing it is 0.965%. Thats bloody low. \n\nFor the people who dont know what bond yields indicate. The lower the yield, the less confident the market is in the market and they trust the US govt more than the stock market. \n\nJapan owns the most debt of all countries out off all nations except of course the USA. It's current debt holdings stand at $1.15trillion. Its GDP is around $5.3trillion dollars. Its last GDP report showed negative GDP growth and if it gets another report of negative growth - its called a recession for Japan at that point.\n\n\nWith China being under lockdown still, global trade slowing down, yields going down and Japan on the brink of a recession. EWJ puts are the best play. Japan's age demographic is old. In 2014, estimates were 33% were over 60. 25% 65+ and 13% 75+. While compared to the US, its 39% for 45+. With intrapolation, thats around 25% over 60 in 2010..\n\nThe median age in Japan is 48.4 while in the US is 37.5\n\nJapan is also considering cancelling the Olympics due to CoronaVirus. That has some impact (not fatal) on the economy.  CV fucks old people more than young. So take that how you will\n\n\n\n\n[Disclaimer: Im not holding any positions as I dont have enough money to pay the premium as I fucked up on TSLA and Im not using margin to play in these markets]\n\nStrike: you choose exp date : at least 3 months out", "created_utc": 1583291216.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fd6llf/japan_is_fucked/", "is_self": true}
