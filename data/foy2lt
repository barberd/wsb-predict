I wanted to sell on Monday after a huge drop at open but after seeing that didn't happen with the infinite QE, I got greedy and waited.\n\nPlan for next time:\n\n1. Write down exit strategies both up and down side (exit half of all positions once we hit 200 and rest if we hit 185. Wait for next bounce at that time.)\n2. Write down back-up exit strategy\n3. Execute to the plan and don't let greed/fear get in the way\n\nStill holding...\n\nBig Short, SPY 220/200p 4/17 5/15,  SIX 15p 4/17, EWG 16p 4/17, HOG 18p 5/15, BAC 15p 9/18", "created_utc": 1585169756.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/foy2lt/pigs_get_slaughtered_well_thats_me/", "is_self": true}
