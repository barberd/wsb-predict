All the memes that I've seen here has inspired and apparently triggered my full autist senses. I saw people going crazy over SPCE today, and this weekend but didn't believe it would continue to go up.\n\nThat is where I went wrong. For the first time in my life I YOLOed my savings (not much but honest work) into SPCE at $35.64. I was happy with my decision and went to take a shower to calm my autist abilities. I got out of the shower and opened up Robinhood to see if I was instantly rich like what you guys had predicted. ALL I SAW WAS RED.  I freaking bought SPCE at the peak and I screwed myself over. \n\nRIP. I will go to the doctor for a vaccine to see if I become even more autistic.", "created_utc": 1582050762, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f5wbz3/you_guys_have_ruined_my_life/", "is_self": true}
