{"id": "fh19sw", "title": "Changing the Public Narrative & Promoting Consumer Confidence through GILD's Remdesivir", "selftext": "So, yeah, WHO just designated the spread of Covid-19 as a pandemic. My thought for this post was when I heard that a emergency meeting was called for all US health officials at the White House. Anyways, my DD on GILD and a scenario in which BULL returns:\n\nThe government has a chance to reinstate public confidence by fast-tracking Remdesivir (GILD's Covid-19 treatment, which you guys all know by now). Imagine having an effective treatment available if you fall into the mild/severe range after contracting Covid-19. Essentially, Covid-19 would be less of a threat than the flu, since we don't even have an effective treatment for this seasonal MF that kills tens of thousands here (US) every year. Instantly, public sentiment would shift and the markets would mainly have to consider only the supply-side effects of Covid-19 on the economy rather than demand-side repercussions. Since, we're already well priced in for the supply-side shock, allaying fears and resigning Covid-19 to the annals of scary-what-coulda-happened. Covid-19 would be like that fucked up relative who comes to visit once a year on the holidays, but just once a year, and is then promptly ushered to the airport or whatever shithole he/she came from. \n\nI am not a medical expert or know much about anything, so please take this with a grain of salt and do your own research. This is my first post, too, but I don't think that seems to matter too much (I've been lurking for about 8 months) on this sub since most of the posts seem like pump and dump shitposts anyways. I wish I was gifted with eloquence or a sense of charismatic voice, but alas, it was not to be, so read accordingly fellow autists.\n\n**Initial Washington Patient**\n\nGILD's Remdesivir drug \\*seemed\\* to have effectively treated a patient. I'm using \\*\\* because this is just one case and the medical community doesn't seem convinced whether the drug was effective or that the patient got well himself. An article about the Washington man who received the treatment is below:\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-01/coronavirus-case-treated-with-gilead-drug-may-spur-wider-tests](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-01/coronavirus-case-treated-with-gilead-drug-may-spur-wider-tests)\n\nThere was another post/article that I read previously (which I can't seem to easily find through Google) that detailed the progress of the patient on a daily basis. The post/article described the sudden deterioration off the patient's condition and requested compassionate use of Remdesivir. If anyone knows of or finds the article, I'd appreciate it if you could leave it in the comment section.\n\n**Nebraska Patient & US Death Count**\n\nThe NIH stated that GILD would be providing Remdesivir to patient(s) in a Nebraska quarantine hospital facility. The press release was issued on February 25th, link below:\n\n[https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-clinical-trial-remdesivir-treat-covid-19-begins](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-clinical-trial-remdesivir-treat-covid-19-begins)\n\nTo my knowledge, and the sites I frequent through Google search, there hasn't been any deaths related to the coronavirus so far in Nebraska (as of this post date: 03/11/2020), which gives credence that Remdesivir may be effective as a treatment (or that it did not affect the outcome), since we should have seen some deaths from the people who contracted the coronavirus earlier.\n\n**China Phase 3 Clinical Trials/Experiment (?)**\n\nYou guys can Google this, since there doesn't seem to be a lack of articles covering this subject. Essentially, GILD is conducting experiments right now. If proven effective, I believe the FDA would fast-track this drug as treatment for Covid-19. The results of this experiment may come out anytime from later this month (there was an article a couple days ago from someone who claimed that initial results may be released earlier) to sometime in May. I read (without a link because I'm now too lazy to Google and find all these articles) that results should be out by early May since the clinical trials end in late April.\n\n**Remdesivir as a Prophylactic Treatment Argument**\n\n\\*If\\* Remdesivir is effective against Covid-19, then it may also be used as a prophylactic treatment (like a vaccine). The following article is mainly concerned about the financial windfall expectation of Remdesivir for GILD, but it also explains the possible use of Remdesivir if it is proven effective as a treatment to Cover-19 (so, expanded label type of argument).\n\n[https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/03/09/will-gilead-sciences-make-a-fortune-off-its-corona.aspx](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/03/09/will-gilead-sciences-make-a-fortune-off-its-corona.aspx)\n\nRemdesivir shows promise in clinical studies on mice with MERS:\n\n[https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/02/12/1922083117](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/02/12/1922083117)\n\n**Counter Argument -** \n\n**Washington Post Article on Remdesivir as a failed Ebola treatment**\n\nThe Washington Post article is behind a paywall, so I'm just leaving the title of the article:\n\n\"The Best Hope for Coronavirus Treatment is an Experimental Drug that Fizzled Against Ebola\"\n\nEssentially, the article states that Remdesivir is a broad anti-viral that was created to treat Ebola but was ineffective (if I recall correctly, the author used strong language to describe the inefficacy of Remdesivir, something like \"utterly failed\"). The general takeaway seems to be along the lines of 'if this drug was not created for Covid-19 or for Coronavirus' specifically, can we really be hopeful that this drug will magically cure patients for which it was not created for?\n\n**Upside Limit - Movement Limitations Observed**\n\nThe following link is the same as the one above regarding Remdesivir as a possible prophylactic treatment. In the articles he author brings up some Merrill Lynch guy who says the financial windfall won't be that big for GILD even if Remdesivir is proven effective.\n\n[https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/03/09/will-gilead-sciences-make-a-fortune-off-its-corona.aspx](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/03/09/will-gilead-sciences-make-a-fortune-off-its-corona.aspx)\n\nThere are many articles regarding this subject, so, yeah, Google away.\n\nOf course, Remdesivir could be shown to be an utter fail in treating Covid-19, but I don't believe so. Even WHO and our government are stating that it's our best chance.\n\n**My Ending Thoughts & Conclusion**\n\nIn my opinion, GILD will be sitting on a gold mine if Remdesivir shows efficacy in treating Covid-19, not only because it would make money immediately by selling the drug to treat patients but also because nation-states would stockpile the fuck out of this drug, like they do for all other medical supplies. I'm not sure about the shelf-life for Remdesivir (I'm a fellow autist with no other specialty than creating walls of text and losing tendies), but I'm pretty sure many countries are going to constantly re-up like drug users every now and then. Additionally, if Remdesivir is proven effective as a prophylactic, then we all get to laugh maniacally while skipping to our bank.\n\nPlus, SARS, MERS, and Beer Virus-like coronavirus' seem to pop-up every now and then, so we would all look to Remdesivir, if proven effective, first as the preferred/priority treatment. Tendies galore.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr - GILD 05/15 $80 Call and/or GILD 06/19 $80 Call.
