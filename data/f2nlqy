A recession apprared imminent, and everybody was getting gay, but now, we (normal people) look back at that like we do with our middle school emo phase, and the high school libertarian phase. \n\nIf you are still a bear, youre fucking retarded. Not a single position has sold without jPow snatching that shit back. Technically, nothing  has sold for fucking months, as jpow continues to do buybacks. He has infinite money btw. Futures are going fucking parabolic, and this shit can never end. \n\nKnow how autistic people love trains? I love [optionsprofitcalculator.com](optionsprofitcalculator.com) and the fucking chart does go high enough to see where shit will be tommorrow. I sent them a check (thanks MSFT), and I own the site now, so that should be fixed soon. \n\nBaba? Fat fucking buy. Both jPow (its on the nyse) and Chingpow are pumping that shit full of cream, get ready for it to break $1000. \n\nWant fucking DD? Fine. Baba is their amazon, and if you hav Ever talked to a chinese person (No, you havent) youll know they dont put their phones down. They go on Fluhan lockdown, and boom, instead of working in the factory for 14h a day, they sit on their phones, and they buy shit.
