{"id": "fs5guf", "title": "SPY rises and you, or, how long do I need to wait to get my tendies?", "selftext": "Alright you 'tists, here we go. SPY is going to drop, probably down to 240, maybe back down to 220. The question is when, right? \n\n**[SPY 30 day chart with RSI and resistance levels.](https://i.imgur.com/PBUj9o0.png)**\n\n*NOTE: all these levels and shit are completely based on intuition. Basically when we look for these levels, we are just looking for patterns in the stock movements, areas where it met resistance. Why does it do that? Nobody can fucking say.*\n\nThere's a few key things to notice here. First of all the RSI. **Right now RSI level is getting a bit high** but it's not astronomical. We are around 61 RSI right now. Take a look at 5 fridays ago when the RSI dipped below 30, then what happened? SPY shot up past 300 again. Most of you didn't fucking care as much back then because you were still praying for your MSFT $200 3/20 calls. But now that you are leveraged to the tits in SPY $200 4/17, you are a lot more sensitive to these drops.\n\nYou can see some other points where RSI dips below 30, and again the market spikes up, but there was a lot of volatility earlier in the month, so shit was way more erratic. Now things are slowing down, and while the situation with the virus isn't good, it isn't completely unknown either. We can start creating new pricing models and forecasts, even if those forecasts mean 2,000,000 baristas are out of a job for a few months. So our RSI level right now, rising but not crazy. **We are probably due for a drop in the next 1-2 weeks**. I know that's not what most of you want to hear, and it will probably come sooner, but you should be prepared for that.\n\nNow once it drops, what to expect?\n\n**[SPY 14 day view](https://i.imgur.com/F1yzZe9.png)**\n\nAs you may have noticed, JPow's printer can print hard, but it is having some trouble. **It seems to be stuck at 260.** Where else have we seen this? About 2 weeks ago we were dancing around the 260 line as well, having a lot of trouble breaking through. But there was a lot more downward pressure back then, but there was still resistance. (You should fully expect that even this was the Fed and other market forces attempting to slow the drop.) But the virus prevailed and all you tendie counting autists got to collect your puts. \n\nAfter that we danced around 238, 228, and then finally went to the low of 218. While that is the bottom that we touched, **i don't think that is the resistance level, i think that is closer to 220.**\n\nAt this point, we are seeing a lot of sideways movement around 260, which isnt a great sign for you put holders. Given the gap down from 275 to 260 on the way down, we don't have any other known resistance between those two points. This means that **if we break out of 260 on the way up, you should expect the next stop to be 275.**\n\nOne more thing, looking at the gaps between afterhours trading\n\n**[SPY 15 Day Gapped Chart](https://i.imgur.com/aNI1zFM.png)**\n\nYou can see on the way down we had a lot of days opening significantly lower than the previous days due to a lot of action happening after hours. Similarly on the way up, you can see a lot of opening higher than the previous day. So what to look for here **once the market starts gapping down, or we have one day that closes low, I'd expect the downward leg to start.** I'd expect that leg to try to test 240. And then possibly 228.\n\nedit: tl;dr spy potentially 240 in a couple weeks, or breakout to 275 and you're all fucked. also [my positions](https://i.imgur.com/u4SVFbm.png)", "created_utc": 1585625022.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fs5guf/spy_rises_and_you_or_how_long_do_i_need_to_wait/", "is_self": true}
