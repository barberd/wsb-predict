{"id": "g6ahz4", "title": "The Inverse WSB Market Convergence Theorem", "selftext": "After painstakingly studying options and their performance over many weeks, WSB mathematicians are pleased to announce a new theorem which will shake the financial world for centuries to come.\n\nWith this theorem in hand, the \"Random Walk\" theory of the markets can be refuted, and a precise convergence point for market prices may be found, allowing precise prediction of market direction.\n\nLet's dive right in...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The Inverse WSB Market Convergence Theorem\n\n*1) WSB aggregate demand for puts at price P will establish a resistance floor beyond which the market shall not pass.*\n\n*2) WSB aggregate demand for calls at price C will establish a resistance ceiling beyond which the market shall not pass.*\n\n*3) All else being equal, the market will trend toward convergence point L, which is the average price point of WSB aggregate demand for both calls (C) and puts (P), and represents the proximal maximum loss potential for all outstanding WSB options.*\n\n*4) This price point L is released from its constraints upon passing the WSB aggregate option expiry date for outstanding options E.*\n\n[Proof by Fancy Graph](https://preview.redd.it/irv81zy0yfu41.png?width=1180&format=png&auto=webp&s=bffe2750e0c033ef983b9e1ae113f01e279b2c27)\n\nThis may sound a little complicated, so I will offer a Layman Definition:\n\n**The market will converge on the exact price point which causes maximum losses for all outstanding WSB options.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe only have to offer a few simple examples to show the enormous predictive power this theorem has in determining market direction. Why, for instance, has the market rallied hard over the past few weeks? Was it because of JPOW and his printers? No... We can see this is simply *post hoc* rationalization and that the true explanation is the INVERSE WSB MARKET CONVERGENCE THEOREM!\n\nThe overwhelming sentiment of WSB over the past several weeks has been BEARISH, with strong demand for SPY PUTS at various levels. This aggregate put demand at multiple price points helped buoy markets higher and higher for weeks on end. Only once the WSB aggregate demand for CALLS began to rise did the market start to slow its ascent and level off.\n\nIf WSB demand for calls and puts are equal, the market will remain flat, guaranteeing maximum loss via theta. Once those options expire and are not replaced, OR once WSB switches to theta gang and begins selling options *en masse*, it can be predicted that market volatility will spike.\n\nWe now have a model by which market direction can be predicted with extreme accuracy. However, this reality is complicated by the fact that any WSB attempts to inverse itself will then act as a new WSB sentiment, creating a self-defeating and circular paradox similar in nature to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, rendering attempts to profit from the theorem by members of WSB eternally futile.\n\n**Positions (used to prove the theorem):**\n\nIWM 120c 4/24\n\nIWM 118p 4/24\n\nIf the theorem is true this will suggest a flat market tomorrow, maximizing my losses. However, my options are simply a tiny sample of total WSB aggregate positions and is therefore not necessarily predictive. The price tomorrow will be the price at which we all lose maximum tendies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: 6 Upvotes. This is what I max out on with this effort... 6 fucking upvotes.\n\nHEY GUIS! OIL CHEAP!
