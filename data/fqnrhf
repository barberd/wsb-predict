{"id": "fqnrhf", "title": "Economy vs stock prices", "selftext": "Listen we have all had our fun riding puts off the corona pandemic, heres some reasoning that it might be short lived.\n\nSo the sudden drop in stock prices we just experienced is unlike any other in history to my knowledge.  The selloff wasnt based on any underlying fundamental flaw in our economy.  \n\nIn 08 the housing market was built on a deck of cards.  \n\nIn 29 the banks didnt have cash on hand to back their deposits.  \n\nIn 2020 the stock market crashed over uncertainty involving the supply chain disruption coming from virus stricken china, it dropped more over uncertainty of productivity in the US during our own lockdowns, it dropped more cuz FUCKING OIL.  Now its kinda sideways.  Theres not much more uncertainty left for it to drop much more.  \n\nSure we will hit a breaker on monday, but thats a correction to the past week maybe.  \n\nBut the stock market is not the economy.  The stock market is generally a month or two ahead of the economy.  If investors see things happening next month they react now.  Investors are watching the global numbers and see that certain countries are NOT burning down.  They are looking at May 2020 and seeing businesses starting operations again and a tapering off of the COVID numbers.  What could possibly happen before May that would cause more uncertainty than the EVERYTHING SHUTTING DOWN that we are currently doing?? I really cant see anything, thats why the timing of the oil plummet was so devastating.  \n\nSorry for the wall of text.  \n\nTLDR:  dont YOLO anything, maybe SPY 280c 6/19/2020 with a 4/17 220p to hedge.  \n\nAlso i have no idea what im talking about its the weekend and im bored as shit, casinos are closed", "created_utc": 1585414299.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqnrhf/economy_vs_stock_prices/", "is_self": true}
