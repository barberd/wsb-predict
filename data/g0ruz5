P/E ranges from 22-30 on these mentioned.\n\nAll of my calls are just OTM or slightly ITM, all dates are 4/17.  Have some JNUG 4/24, but the position is tiny, as the price movements of gold related stocks have been difficult for me to anticipate (still actively educating myself).\n\nTLDR;   WMT, MSFT, and KO (all 4/17 calls), are my plays right now.  May take a position in QQQ soon.  Will roll these into 4/24 or 5/1 calls by EOD Wednesday\n\nEdit:  just rechecked PYPL \u2014 I\u2019m liking what I see there as well", "created_utc": 1586812676.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0ruz5/next_possible_plays/", "is_self": true}
