{"id": "fpqf7b", "title": "GM Building Mass Ventilators = Fake News = People Can't Breathe", "selftext": "On Sunday, Trump tweeted out that auto execs were teaming up to build much needed ventilators.  It appears, the auto execs never got the full logistics of the buildout and who was paying.\n\nGM initially said that they could turn their car factory and use auto transmissions to quickly build 20,000 ventilators. Turns out that was false, and they realized that auto transmissions do not have much in common with ventilators and they maybe will be able to get 5000 out.\n\nThe administration is back at square one and talking with other manufacturers to get realistic pricing and ventilator numbers. Even if they are able to find a manufacturer in the next week, do we expect them to turn out 20,000+(still a low number) ventilators within a month or sooner? If so, what will the infection and severe cases look like by then? If not, what will deaths look like? \n\nI wonder if Donny's optimistic tweets and outlook helps the market pump? If it does, reality should hit and we realize that Uncle Donny was only speaking in hyperbole and market should correct for that? \n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/us/politics/coronavirus-ventilators-trump.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/us/politics/coronavirus-ventilators-trump.html)", "created_utc": 1585282352.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpqf7b/gm_building_mass_ventilators_fake_news_people/", "is_self": true}
