{"id": "ez1xt6", "title": "Money laundering or tax-free genius?", "selftext": "Alright I just need a reality check by my favorite autistic traders to confirm this is/isn't possible. Shout out to the upcoming ban on Roth IRA options from u/WSBgod's recent 4 million trade.  \n\n\nOk here's the deal. If I wanted to deposit an unlimited amount of post-tax money into my Roth IRA *legally*, couldn't I do the following:  \n\n\n1) Buy 100 shares of a stock. Sell a covered call limit order on the stock with a retarded high strike price and ask ($500 AMD calls for $40 expiring 2/7).  \n\n\n2) In a separate account, find this retarded contract *and buy it* since it's definitely the only one of its kind.  \n\n\n3) Wait for the contract to expire OTM. My Roth gets a $4k \"bonus\", and I get to mark a $4k capital loss in my taxable account.   \n\n\n4) ~~optional~~ Use this money to make YOLOs until one pans out. Wait till I'm 59.5 to retire with my tax-free millions.  \n\n\nIs there even a law to prevent this? Is there a permutation of this idea that would work?
