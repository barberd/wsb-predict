If you were scared a week ago, then fine. I would understand that. Let me show you autists some numbers to show you what I am talking about here.\n\nAt the beginning of february, the average amount of new confirmed cases was around \\~3000 per day. This was also at a time where we did not really know the recovery rates yet, and the KD ratio of Coronavirus was 3 recovered, 1 died. The recovery rate was at about 200 per day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo at the beginning of february we have 3k per day getting sick, and 200 per day getting healthy, with a KDA of 3 to 1. And you autists are out there wearing your party hats and doing cocaine off of strippers bootycheeks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut that was 20 days ago so let's look at what has been happening with the coronavirus now! \n\nThe KDA of Coronavirus has dropped down to 21,2k recovered vs 2,3k deaths, which would make the coronavirus kicked out of any halo lobby. The daily increase of sick people has been sinking from a high of 2k to a low of 400, orbiting around an average of \\~700. The amount of recoveries are at this time outpacing the amount of newly infected.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThats why I say, if you were worried about this virus one or two weeks ago, I would totally understand BUT what is actually happening is that this virus is turning out to be not so bad after all (just like all the viruses end up, basically)..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease give me your autistic viewpoint of this if you are a market trader who is alpha like me. Here you can see the numbers on your own neatly displayed\n\n[http://gisandata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html?fbclid=IwAR0-DnNscnz4bJm6GPmq5q1NWBjBEapwHKt-s6H3OiEzgMSRzf5G9jtqwik#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6](http://gisandata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html?fbclid=IwAR0-DnNscnz4bJm6GPmq5q1NWBjBEapwHKt-s6H3OiEzgMSRzf5G9jtqwik#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong story short: Bull gang bull gang bull gang, spent 3 rax on calls man, my bitch love do cocaine", "created_utc": 1582457929, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f88ep7/really_not_understanding_the_corona_fears_right/", "is_self": true}
