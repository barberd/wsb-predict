We will start the sell off next week Monday. The new bottom will be the $255 gap that needs to get filled. Don't think well see $220 this year at all. Especially with elections and Trump more than likely winning again.\n\nWith the SPY losing traction im thinking we do one jump up back to $296 and then a straight shot back down towards $255\n\nwe have yet to fill the gap and as we always know, gaps are always going to get filled\n\ni think that once we reach that $255 gap its back to ATHs until Q2 where earnings might be a lot worse than people are anticipating\n\nespecially with Disney suffering this much of a loss with their arks being closed like a month before Q1 ended\n\nI think disney as well as every other company will rebound off these lows and well see a bullish market until Q3 where earnings might not be as great as people think\n\nultimately back to SPY , i think we do one more shoot upwards towards the $296 mark, then start seliing off Monday back down towards the $255 range to fill that gap\n\nthat will be the new low and we wont go any lower\n\nForgot to link: https://www.tradingview.com/chart/SPY/xwN3Ueel-SPY-Short-Starting-May-11-2020/\n\n**Positions: https://imgur.com/gallery/KuH795E** I am still bullish on SPY will be picking up puts when it heads back to $296", "created_utc": 1588716897.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ge7fj7/short_spy_after_it_hits_296_again_it_needs_to/", "is_self": true}
