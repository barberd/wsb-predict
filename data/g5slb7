Easy $20 Million DD Inside.\n\nThis is in response to u/The-Catholic-Priest who claimed that if you bought 1000 crude contracts at their lowest yesterday (-$37.63) you would have $37,630,000 in your account. He then went on to say that you could buy 1400 DOT-111 Railroad Cars at $18,000 each (Total Cost of $25,200,000), plus the locomotives to pull these cars, and other expenses to round up to $26,000,000 (JUST TO TAKE DELIVERY OF THE OIL IN SAID CONTRACTS).\n\n\"If it goes negative again, fucking go for it you goddamned retards, I'll see you on the tracks\" \\*FAMOUS LAST WORDS\\*\n\nu/The-Catholic-Priest Net Profit: $11,630,000\n\n# I'm going to show you all how to make an extra $8 million in one easy step: Go for the Oil Tanker Option\n\nHere's what we know:\n\n* 1 Contract = 1,000 Barrels = 42,000 Gallons\n* 1,000 Contracts = 1,000,000 Barrels = 42,000,000 Gallons\n* 1,000 Contracts @ -$37.63 = +$37,630,000 in your account if you can confirm that you'll take delivery of 42,000,000 Gallons\n\nNow what if I was to tell you that I could find you a ship that could hold your 42,000,000 gallons of oil? Is that something you might be interested in?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[$17,000,000 Ship that holds 159057 DWT](https://preview.redd.it/rmkipt2ix9u41.png?width=1217&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc2a1e8d3fb99d7adddfde2736eb20656418bf8c)\n\nWhat the fuck is a DWT and how does it relate to oil?\n\nAccording to the internet, 1 DWT = 7.39 Barrels of oil (I won't bore you with extra maths. DM me if you're that autistic and really need to know)\n\nSo this ship that costs $17,000,000 can carry up to 159057 DWT which equals 1,175,431.23 Barrels or 49,368,11.7 Gallons of Oil.\n\n$37 mil - $17 mil = +$20 mil and now you have a fucking boat.\n\nCongratulations. You just made a cool $20 Million. This is the difference between Vanderbilt and Getty (oil and rail magnates).\n\nYou're probably asking what the expenses are to run a ship like this. Yeah it's expensive to throw fuel in it. Ship captain for hire is 100K a year. Crew is probably another 200K a year. But the point is this. If oil ever goes negative again. You won't have to worry about locating 1400 oil rail cars (almost impossible). You just have to find a ship with enough DWT space and keep it below 95% capacity due to laws of physics.\n\nIf it goes negative again, fucking go for it you god damned autists. I'll see you on the open seas.\n\n**TL;DR: If oil goes negative again go all in on 1000 contracts and buy a boat for $17 Million**", "created_utc": 1587520925.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5slb7/you_retards_missed_out_part_2_rail_vs_yacht/", "is_self": true}
