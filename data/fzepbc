{"id": "fzepbc", "title": "The Yacht of Horns: Perma-Bull Aphorisms", "selftext": "How the man got onto the yacht, no one knew. The man walked upon the deck as if he had owned the ship. His face was marred with dirt. His beard was unshaven and murky. His clothing was that of rags. People stared at the man as if he were crazy, a nuisance, a powerless fool to be shunned and ignored. But they eyed him, the man made sure of it. He stood, chest pointed to the blue sky, jaw parallel to the ground, both middle fingers above his head. If he were scared by their judgments, he didn't show it. Despite the man looking as if he were homeless, his voice boomed with authority, leadership, and certainty. The blind would have heard a CEO in action. Soldiers at the frontline with nothing but a radio would have heard a general. And as he stood at the center stage of the yacht, the people looked up to him as he stared down at them.\n\n*Today, Gentlemen, I say to you the Perma-Bull Aphorisms. Heed these words. Study this scripture. These aphorisms operate in no particular order, for they are etched through scars. And each letter an unbroken principle.*\n\n---\n\n> **1|Ten Minutes of YOLO Is Worth A Decade of Investing|**\n\nDo not be fooled, Gentlemen, you only have to win once. YOLO is the defining Moral Principle of all Bulls. Of what comes from YOLO is boldness. And it is the act of boldness that swamps all of your past failures. Timidity is a fool's bargain, such is the fate of investing. \n\n> **2|Diamond Hands|**\n\nIn the face of the bear, remain unwavering. Stand. Hold. Be earthbound. By Blood and Knuckle, you will hold your positions with the pressure and density of a diamond. You shall let the bear thunder around you. And as the bears thunder, you will remain stoic. You will soon realize that everything the bear does is a hoax, a false mask of bravado. As such, you will hold. And although some of you were born with glass hands, you must remember that glass, when broken, shatters into a weapon.\n\n> **3|It Is the Bull Who Wins|**\n\nNot even the greatest bear has beaten the Bull. The Bull charges with its horns. And rams upward, because that is the only place the Bull can go--up. Matadors may wave their flags of red, thinking they have the Bull fooled, yet the Bull, nonetheless, rams upward. It is the matadors who run away, revealing their asses for the Bull's horns, it is the bears who fall, getting their four paws on the ground, submitting themselves to the Bull. And it is the Bull who remains at the Top.\n \n> **4|Faced by Red Charts and Red Markets, Many People Step Back, Not Forward|**\n\nThe sight of blood does not scare the Bull. Blood is a sign of weakness from the prey. Stride forward, gentlemen, take the bear by its fur. Look at the Red Charts, stare at the Red Markets and you will see opportunity. Like the two horns on a Bull, double down on your positions. Hit those positions at its weakest and at its lowest. And if those positions go even lower, double down again and again. And as you have exhausted your resources and cannot contribute anymore, and as the Market continues to fall, you too will bleed. And you will continuously bleed, feeling the pain, letting your own blood drip as the market dips. But Gentlemen, when your own blood spills, you do not step back. Natural like a blink, laconic in action, you stride forward.\n\n> **5|The Gains Are Infinite|**\n\nRemember this, Gentlemen: the upside is unlimited and the downside is limited. By this nature, it is better to make a Call, even if it would turn out to be the wrong decision. And if you made the wrong Call and you lose your initial bet, Gentlemen, so what? What is $10 to $100? $100 to $10,000? $10,000 to $1,000,000? If you do not make that Call with the cash you have on-hand, then you have made the ultimate loss, you have hit the floor and remained there, refusing yourself the potential of unlimited Gains. It is better to make the call and lose that $1 than to lose the possibility of turning that $1 to $1,000,000. FOMO is a false god.\n\n> **6|Opportunities Are Never Exhausted|**\n\nThere will come, Gentlemen, when you YOLO and lose all your money. It is inevitable. But you must remember that as long as you have money, be it in the bank, credit cards, loans, cracks between the couches, pennies along the streets, you have the opportunity to make money. And even if you no longer have money, as long as you have your legs, your arms, your lips, and all the other orifices among your body, your ability to make money is still there. You may think you have no more opportunities, that the Market is against you, that the Bears do not wish to see you rich, but Gentleman, that in itself is an opportunity to make money. As long as you live, your opportunities are countless.\n\n---\nThe crowd stared at the man, unsure what to make of his antics. What they saw was an insane, dirty, perhaps drunk, homeless man rambling nonsense that is only understood by other homeless men. But the crowd listened, and they listened as a child does to their old and wise Grandfather telling tales of adventures and fortunes. And while the crowd was in a yacht, enjoying their vacations, and while they listened to the homeless man speak, the crowd might as well have been homeless too, for they do not own their own yacht to live in.\n\nThe homeless man continued, with more vigor in his already booming voice, the man continued as if these were his last hopes and words to a stagnant nation, a dying breed, a fallen Bull.\n\n*There are many lost souls, many of those who have lost their money, many of those who walked into the Yacht of Horns and the House of Furs, feebly attempting to \"play\" both sides and \"double\" their profits, only to be slaughtered in the end. In truth, it is the Yacht of Horns that wins. The more closely you follow these words, the more you will find what you have been searching for your entire life. Return to these words when you are lost. Etch these words unto your bones and your scars, and you will never be lost.*\n\n*Come, my Bulls, and listen. Forever do not stop, for there are tendies to be made. Forever do not stop, for there are bears to kill. Forever do not stop, for it is your glory, dreams, and Horns at risk. My Bulls, forever do not stop, for it is us who Rise.*", "created_utc": 1586631903.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fzepbc/the_yacht_of_horns_permabull_aphorisms/", "is_self": true}
