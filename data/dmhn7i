{"id": "dmhn7i", "title": "Why AMZN could beat earnings today", "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/25/amazon-earnings-q2-2019.html\n\nDuring the previous quarter's earnings, AMZN missed due to a drop in profit: not revenue. They beat revenue estimates but lost in profit margins from an $800mil investment in their warehouses and such. Now, I don't know if these prodit margin eating investments have seeped into this quarter because I am no AMZN insider, but AMZN is very likely to beat Q3 expectations IF they don't have such investments.\n\nAmazon Web Services is a core part of the business, and is threatened by MSFT's Azure. But, Azure's growth has slowed a teensy bit, meaning they are not taking away AS much market share from AWS,  *potentially.*\n\nBottom line: consider Azure's threat to AWS and profit margin eating investments (whether or not they are occuring) when playing earnings today. And DO NOT buy 10/25 options: Theta and IV got big dick energy, and the IV crush will account for an even bigger drop in premium than Vega.
