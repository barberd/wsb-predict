Isn't that insane? There was a [recent study](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/early-results-dampen-outlook-for-experimental-covid-19-treatment-2020-03-14) that spooked investors with \"mixed results\", but if you drill down to it they didn't actually find that it doesn't work, they just found some uncomfortable side-effects like nausea and diarrhea. When thousands of people are dying in a couple of weeks, do you really think they're gonna care about a little nausea if it helps them *avoid fucking dying*?!\n\nBut we don't need any fancy controlled studies anyway, we can just go to reddit's own /r/medicine, where [the doctors currently dealing with this shit in Seattle](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/figd1n/i_posted_a_while_back_seeking_a_clinical_portrait/) congregate. These guys are on the ground *right now*, this info doesn't have weeks of publishing delay, and they're saying that *it works*. Marked improvement. Impressive trajectory. Doctors begging for more compassionate use authorizations because they know it *saves lives*.\n\nBeer flu is coming down on 40-70% of Americans, the lives of millions of people are going to hang by threads, we all know a vaccine isn't coming anywhere near soon enough, and there's this *one company* in the whole world that owns the patent on something which actually makes a marked difference. What do you think is gonna happen to their stock? This is your one chance in all this mess to let your inner bull run wild again!\n\nTL;DR: [GILD 5/15 $80 C](https://i.imgur.com/wZE46Pe.png) \ud83d\udc02\ud83d\udc02\ud83d\udc02", "created_utc": 1584426194.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fk0els/gilead_has_the_cure_why_are_you_not_buying_calls/", "is_self": true}
