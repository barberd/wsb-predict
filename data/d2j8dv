Which by the way has been down in our industry the last 2 quarters and at the worse levels since 2008-2009. \n\nUnemployment may be at its lowest % in a decade, but believe me when I tell you this company is not the only company that is going to be preparing for the next trough. And in doing so we will see unemployment rise in the coming 2 quarters.
