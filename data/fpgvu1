Now, just as trading is surging, exchanges are warning  that regulations could sideline banks that keep the market functioning.**\n\n**At  issue are capital rules that determine how much risk Wall Street banks,  which clear options trades, can take on behalf of their clients.** Top  officials at [Cboe Global Markets Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com./quote/CBOE:US), Nasdaq Inc. and the [New York Stock Exchange](https://www.bloomberg.com./quote/NYX:US)  told the Federal Reserve last week that a jump in buying and selling  was putting market makers perilously close to hitting their bank-imposed  limits. The exchanges urged the Fed to give banks more leeway to handle  the increased demand, according to a copy of a letter reviewed by  Bloomberg.\n\n**Investors rely on options to hedge against declines in equity prices  and to bet on broad market moves, such as a surge or plunge for the  S&P 500**. The products have been embraced at a time when coronavirus  is triggering significant angst about the state of the global economy,  and as a result, roller-coaster trading days.\n\n\u201cThey become the go-to-instrument when markets become  volatile and investors and market participants seek to manage their risk  exposure,\u201d said Andy Nybo, a managing director at [Burton-Taylor International Consulting](https://www.bloomberg.com./quote/1486091D:US), which provides analysis to financial firms.\n\n**There has been a surge of options trading this year, and at  the current pace March would have the highest monthly volume in U.S.  exchange-traded options in at least five years,** according to Nybo\u2019s  estimates.\n\n## Banks Vital\n\n**Banks  play a pivotal role in the options market because they settle  transactions for market makers** \\-- the professional traders who sit on  the other side of wagers made by fund managers and mom-and-pop  investors. But **banks may resist clearing trades if it means having to  set aside more capital. Should they pull back, it would effectively put a  cap on market makers\u2019 portfolios.** Cboe, [Nasdaq](https://www.bloomberg.com./quote/NDAQ:US)  and the NYSE say **that is at risk of happening just as volatility is  hitting records and investors are desperate to trade options.**\n\n**\u201cIt is critical to extend immediate relief,\u201d** the exchanges  said in the March 18 letter to Fed Vice Chairman for Supervision Randal  Quarles and other officials. **\u201cWe implore the Board to exercise its  considerable authority to grant relief to expand clearing capacity  during a time of extraordinary market stress.\u201d**\n\nIn a statement, **NYSE said the exchanges\u2019 want the Fed to take action  before the end of the month so that market participants can benefit from  increased liquidity and price discovery.** Cboe and Nasdaq declined to  comment on the request to the Fed.\n\nA Fed spokesman said Quarles received the letter, but the agency had no further comment.\n\n## Rule Shortcomings\n\nU.S. regulators have acknowledged that the way they require banks to  calculate risk from derivatives clients has shortcomings. The process is  known as the current exposure methodology, or CEM. **In November, U.S.  officials announced they were shifting to a different measure known as  the standardized approach for counter-party credit risk, or SA-CCR.**\n\n**That  revision should lead to reduced capital requirements for banks\u2019  derivatives contracts. Supporters say it also will improve market  liquidity.**\n\n**But SA-CCR isn\u2019t supposed to start going live until  April, and it will probably take much longer before Wall Street applies  it to options clearing. That\u2019s because banks are required to use the new  methodology across their firms, meaning it will likely take time to hit  each individual business line.**\n\nCboe, Nasdaq and NYSE want the Fed to speed things up by letting  banks start using SA-CCR this month on options contracts or by applying a  different fix that enables lenders to overhaul their risk calculations.\n\n## Risk Deadlines\n\n**The  timing is important because March 31 marks the end of both the month  and the first quarter. Banks will likely make decisions before the month  closes about how much clearing they\u2019re willing to do in April. And the  conclusion of a quarter is typically when banks assess whether to expand  or contract certain business lines.**\n\nAnother issue is that just a few firms handle much of the  clearing for exchange-traded equity options, according to two people  familiar with the matter. [Goldman Sachs Group Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com./quote/GS:US), [Bank of America Corp.](https://www.bloomberg.com./quote/BAC:US) and ABN AMRO Bank NV are dominant, said the people who asked not to be named in discussing data that isn\u2019t public.\n\nGoldman Sachs, Bank of America and ABN declined to comment.\n\n## Regulatory \u2018Disincentives\u2019\n\nThe  exchanges also sent a copy of their letter to Fed Chairman Jerome  Powell, FDIC Chairman Jelena McWilliams, Comptroller of the Currency  Joseph Otting, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton  and Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Heath Tarbert.\n\nDuring a March 24 public call with an industry advisory  panel, Tarbert said the CFTC wanted to ensure bank capital rules don\u2019t  create \u201cdisincentives\u201d for firms to provide liquidity to the options  market. However, he said bank regulators would ultimately be the ones  who would have to make any changes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very much an ongoing dialog,\u201d Tarbert said.\n\n//\n\n**TLDR; market makers begging FED to change rules immediately so they have access to more $$.**\n\n**They're running out of lube!!**\n\nPositions: \n\nSPY 180p 4/17, SPY 175p 4/17 and SPY 200p 5/15", "created_utc": 1585247586.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpgvu1/bloomberg_fed_hears_pleas_to_ease_rules_on_banks/", "is_self": true}
