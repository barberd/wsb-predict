So I figure some of you could learn some shit. TLDR at bottom.\n\nSo SPY ended today down 1.45%. Great, puts are printing, yes? Well, not really. Puts barely gained value thanks to those bitches IV crush and theta. If you don't know what those are, you definitely shouldn't trade options but what you really need to know is that they will make you lose all your tendies if you are buying options. So how can we make good tendies if we don't have enough cash to go theta gang or god forbid, stock gang?\n\nHopefully, most of you are aware that you don't need to actually own an option to sell it, this is called writing an option and gives you the obligation to later buyback that option at whatever price it is currently trading it. If the underlying stock is OTM at expiration, the option will be worthless and you will not need to spend anything to buy it back and you will keep the full premium you initially received for writing the option.\n\nSince most weekly OTM options expire worthless, they are great selling opportunities. However, you need collateral to sell an option in case you get assigned. So what you need to do is buy a slightly OTM option (probably a put in this current market) with a long-term expiry (at least May, preferably June or later). This will be pretty expensive, but if you do everything right, you should be able to cover the entire cost of the option and more before expiration.\n\nAfter buying your long-term option, you will now need to sell a short-term option, one that expires in less than a week. Your goal is to sell an option that you are very sure will expire worthless, but you also want to collect the maximum premium possible. Keep in mind that you cannot sell an option with a strike price over your long-term option without extra cash collateral, so you can choose an equal strike (calendar spread) or a lower strike (diagonal spread), depending on how risky you want to go. If I'm playing SPY, I like to choose an option 4-6% OTM ($10-$15).\n\nSo as an example, let's say I bought a 5/15 245 put this Friday morning for $1250. Then, I sell a 4/6 239 put at the end of the day for $125. This already covers 10% of the long-term option's cost.\n\nSPY is currently sitting at $248.40. What happens to my portfolio at EOD Monday, when the written option expires?\n\nSPY goes up or stays flat:\n The May put will lose at least some value just from theta and IV, but the weekly will expire worthless and cover part or all of the loss.\n\nSPY goes down but stays above 239:\nBest case scenario. May put gains value AND the weekly expires worthless. Max tendies achieved.\n\nSPY goes down below 239:\nYikes. If the weekly put expires ITM, you will be assigned to buy 100 shares of the underlying at $239. You will be forced to use your May put to sell 100 shares at $245. In the end, you will net $600. This is ok, but you would be much better off doing one of two things instead:\n\nClose the spread before expiry, ideally as soon as the put goes ITM in case of early assignment. You will net much more than $600 because the May put has a ton of time value. You can then use the cash to buy a new long put and start again.\n\nOR, and this is what I would prefer to do, just take the loss on the weekly and sell a new one at the same time with a lower strike price, one that is again likely to expire worthless. On Robinhood you can't trade options that expire on the day, but you can just sell a new option that expires on Wednesday instead. You'll take a small loss on the weekly, but it will certainly be outweighed by the profits from the long put.\n\nRegardless of what happens, once you get rid of the weekly, just sell a new one. Remember, you don't necessarily have to do it right away. If you think a big red day is coming, you may want to wait to make a safer play. I usually like to write options that expire in no more than two or three days. The premiums will be lower, but the risk is also much lower. Over time, you should be able to collect enough premium to completely cover the cost of your long put. At that point, any profits from the long put are essentially free!\n\nThis is a pretty simple strategy that has a much higher probability of profit than standard \ud83d\udc3b/\ud83d\udc04 gang and requires far less cash than playing the wheel with Theta Gang.\n\n\nTL:DR, buy a long-term option slightly OTM, sell weekly options against it with an equal or lower strike, adjust strikes as necessary, make tendies.", "created_utc": 1585952826.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fuhy97/the_magic_of_calendardiagonal_spreads_and_how_to/", "is_self": true}
