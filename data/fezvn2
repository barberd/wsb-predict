Here\u2019s an Alternative View.", "selftext": "It\u2019s like an autistic morgue in here (which I imagine features bodies sorted by shape and gender and then ordered by height and toenail length). \n\nAnd this comment may age really badly, but I don\u2019t think things are that bad. What I\u2019m seeing right now from you cucks is the mirror image of a month ago. Irrationality to the extreme. \n\nConsider:\n\n-There are 1.4 billion people in China and 80,000 cases of Corona. That\u2019s a .00006 chance of infection. \n\n-Of those 80,000 cases there have been 3,070 deaths\n\n-There have been almost 6,000 cases in Iran and 145 deaths. And I\u2019m pretty sure they just give you some baby aspirin and send you home there. \n\nIt\u2019s serious. People will die unnecessarily in the US. But every post on here predicts a post apocalyptic America where we fight over sections of Costco. \n\nShit\u2019s not that bad. \n\nWe will adjust to this risk, recognize that we shouldn\u2019t live like savages and wash our damn hands, and stop licking our fingers after we hold on to a railing. And most of us will be fine! \n\nI\u2019m in April calls on DIS, AAPL and COST. Puts on oil because that may actually go to zero regardless. \n\nI\u2019m sorry to the .00006 and fuck I hope I\u2019m not one of them. But this madness will pass. And we should all make money in a brighter future.", "created_utc": 1583608479, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fezvn2/wsb_is_giving_me_depression_heres_an_alternative/", "is_self": true}
