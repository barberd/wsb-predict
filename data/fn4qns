{"id": "fn4qns", "title": "Dead Cat Bounce?", "selftext": "This is pure speculation. Just blowing rank caramelized onion farts out my ass. I'm wondering here how big a dead cat bounce could be really be in the next few weeks...\n\nSo here's what people keep saying, \"there's going to be a big dead cat bounce up to 270\" or some shit using technical analysis from past recessions. That's great and all, and they have a bunch of fancy charts and what not, but the only thing different here is that technical analysis might just be completely out the window on this one. This is a pandemic spreading at an exponential rate. We'll be at 100,000 cases by Friday, if not sooner; within a month we might be at a 1,000,000 or more cases. All of this is only going to get worse. I'm not really sure how there'll be a rally 20% up in the short term. Like maybe there will be, but who fucking knows? Even if the 2 trillion dollar stimulus is passed, won't people be too sick or scared to go spend their money? A 2 trillion dollar stimulus, though fucking massive, is only 10% of US GDP. As you all saw, Goldman thinks that the US will have -24% GDP in Q2. GDP contracted by like what, 3% in 08 / 09 and the market cut by 60%?\n\nRight now the S&P is trading on a P/E of 15 - 17 ish (I'm speculating, I don't actually know) based on the most recent earnings? For me, that feels high as the virus has just started spreading. The true P/E might be as high as 50 right now given no one is spending dick and earnings are probably a fucking corner lemonade stand for some of the biggest US corporations.\n\nI don't know guys, I'm not sure how this thing rallies 20% in the next few weeks. I might be completely wrong. There might be a couple green days here and again as the market makers take short term profits on volatility, but it's hard for me to see a large and longer term dead cat bounce, one that lasts a couple weeks, on the magnitude of what happened during the Great Depression. For me, it just feels that as cases rise, the market goes down with a couple short 1-2 day bounces up along the way; to kill the virus, the economy has to contract.\n\nAgain, I'm purely speculating here, and there's a really good chance that I'm wrong. Don't read this as advice idiots, because it's not, and don't message me. I don't like to be responsible for people losing or gaining money. I'm just thinking out loud with this post, because some people seem to be so sure that this thing is about to rally.\n\nTLDR: How big could a dead cat bounce possibly be right now?", "created_utc": 1584902738.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fn4qns/dead_cat_bounce/", "is_self": true}
