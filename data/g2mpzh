Your wild emotional swings and anguish stiffen me. Guh\n\nTLDR- SPXU and hold unless you get puts at low volatility (Buy tomorrow with long expiries), the next few months will have longer slower moves. \n\n Here are some calls.\n\nCurrent- S&P 2800 (50% retracement), Move over the past month = short squeeze/ reduce the slope on volatility (compared to March) to squeeze options holders and blow up institutional hedges. Large investors have pushed up futures to unload their stock holdings and go short. Bond yields low, USD neutral. Despite its relatively small market cap, the stock market has been trained to lead movements in much bigger markets like FX and Debt.\n\n1-9 month- S&P tests 2000, breaks to 1800, strong retracements along the way to shake out leverage. USD strong= US dollars come back domestically in flight to safety, Treasuries low. Fed applies more aggressive fiscal and monetary stimulus, swells balance sheet and doesn\u2019t hold any punches. High unemployment. Countries around the world follow suit and essentially nationalize risk across most industries. USD/CAD at $1.50 in the next 2 months, Oil to $10 with supply glut, demand drop and storage full. Large move up in precious metals.\n\n9-14 months- S&P 1800- 1400- widespread defaults. On the eve of a recovery China/ Japan dump treasury holdings triggering a global dump of USD, Spike USD inflation/ interest rates/ run on the dollar. Sets in motion a new down leg and more chaos. China begins switch to becoming new global reserve currency, China begins yuan petro dollars and cashes in on years of diplomacy. Emerging markets and Europe welcome Chinese stability.  Fed stuck in a difficult position having already used their tools excessively. Strong risk of stagflation. Commodities begin rally despite demand shocks.  Historic jump in precious metals.  USD/CAD slides heavily. Countries with large foreign denominated debt experience high inflation. \n\n24 Months - Exports and domestic jobs increase in US. Continued high unemployment. Global Debt Jubilee is declared.  USD/CAD at par. WTI at $25\n\nEnd of long term debt cycle/ deleveraging.  Significant economic damage, political unrest, populism. Strong gravitation to nationalism, protectionism and unwinding of globalism (medium term). Potential for a large war. High interest rates (bond crashes) and equity exodus leave pension funds/ boomers holding the bag, jeopardizing retirements. Colors culture for the next decade. While COVID is the trigger, the end of a long term debt cycle was already on its way. \n\nSPXU 30, averaging down like a true autist", "created_utc": 1587068251.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2mpzh/2_year_economic_calls_from_the_worlds_foremost/", "is_self": true}
