After lighting my Chalkin Mojoflow incense and opening the hen from the cloache up to the breast bone, I was clear as a bell - the entrails showed a pennant overlaying a Wave 4, with the gizzard engorged and purple. Clearly, this shows a massive glut of leveraged debt and option instruments needed to clear.\n\nThe spleen, however, didn't correlate with the Bollinger gizzard, which hasn't happened since 1931 and the rhomboid descending testes pattern in hog futures (lean). Heart showed bruising consistent with overprinted money supply.\n\nTL;DR put some sweet citrus with the vinegar and use honey instead of sugar for the brine, 4 hr cold brine with sea salt, honey, lemon, orange, vinegar and water. Guaranteed tendies.\n\nTL;DR II spy 5/15 $240p\n\nPS Technical Bullshit is the white kids Santeria", "created_utc": 1587302899.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g47non/i_dont_practice_santeria/", "is_self": true}
