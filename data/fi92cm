It concluded that if the US experience an epidemic similar in strength and scope to the Spanish flu, its economy would decline 4.25%-5.5%.\n\n[https://files.stlouisfed.org/files/htdocs/pageone-economics/uploads/newsletter/2008/200802.pdf](https://files.stlouisfed.org/files/htdocs/pageone-economics/uploads/newsletter/2008/200802.pdf)\n\n*However, for a pandemic as severe as the 1918 influenza, estimates of its overall economic impact range from a 4.25 to a 5.5 percent annual decline in GDP\u2014an effect large enough to trigger a significant recession*\n\nTo put that into perspective, the during the great financial crisis from 2007-2009, GDP shrank by 4.2%\n\nWhat took 2 years, we will get in 4 months!  And it's not just us.  The entire world's GDP will shrink greater than what had been observed in the great financial crisis in 4 months!\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great\\_Recession\\_in\\_the\\_United\\_States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession_in_the_United_States)\n\n*According to the* [*Department of Labor*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Labor)*, roughly 8.7 million jobs (about 7%) were shed from February 2008 to February 2010, and real GDP contracted by 4.2% between Q4 2007 and Q2 2009, making the Great Recession the worst economic downturn since the* [*Great Depression*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression)\n\nThat is why the markets are falling so fast and why they are throwing bazookas and the kitchen sink at it.\n\nBuy puts on any rally because the US only has idea of the virus.  It hasn't experience the pain of it like in China or Italy.\n\nWhat's more concerning is that is spready very quickly in India.  And has just got its root in Africa.  That's about 1 billion people that are going to be sick without any solid health care system behind them.\n\nWhat the market hasn't priced in but that are coming are global political instability and collapse of the ***Indian shadow banking***\\*,\\* which will take out big players in Europe and America.  Then the global payment and settlement system will be at risk and we'll have a financial crisis within a public health crisis.\n\nEveryone just hears about liquidity and assume it's safe.  It is not.  The world will be very different in 2 weeks.  in one month.\n\nPuts on everything into this dead cat bounce.", "created_utc": 1584142178.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fi92cm/no_country_for_old_bulls_us_coronavirus_to_drop/", "is_self": true}
