{"id": "bi4j18", "title": "My picks for week of 4/29", "selftext": "\\*notes from last week: I was wrong about MCD cooling off; wrong about puts on QCOM; and wrong about T (my biggest surprise). I was right about SQ to the precise price and day (I said it would bounce to 72.50 on Monday 4/22, which in fact it did); right about SIX and KO ER beat. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. FB. Analyst upgrades and massive purchase order into close (64k shares purchased in last 5min on Friday): [https://www.tradingview.com/x/JyeChtw9/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/JyeChtw9/)  Maybe the fine FB has to pay dampened Friday's trading session and/or profit taking? FB has a habit of fading the day after ER beat (it's beat the past three ER's counting this recent one) and the following day. **The play: 5/10 197.50c; or (courtesy of** u/IrregardlessOfFeels**): June 21st 220c for 0.44ish. This latter play is much safer: sell when FB gets to 198 or 200.** \n2. XLNX: ER showed that revenue was great. Dropped to 111 on Friday, only to bounce hard to 118. If you would have bought FD 120calls on Friday morning, when it was at 111, they cost 0.30 and ended up being 1.88 eod. That's $150 profit per contract (This is the kind of play I dream of: you buy 100x and end up making 15k in a day.) Anyways, the point is that investors are still buying XNLX as their 5g investment/bet. \\***The play: WAIT for the dip on Monday morning. See if it dips to 116ish and then jump in on 5/10 125c for hopefully under $1.0/contract.** For those who like TA, the daily and 4hr show a sexy *shooting star* candle! :) [https://www.tradingview.com/x/QFP7RyV8/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/QFP7RyV8/)\n3. IWM: So IWM has battled with the 158 MEGA IRON resistance so many times it's funny. It tried and failed back in Jan and March 2018. When it finally won on May 11 2018 (the only time it has won), it FLEW!! Now it tried in Feb and got rejected hard. So far IWM has tried to breatk 158 ***ELEVEN times in April,*** including Friday. It will certainly try to continue its attempt on Friday on Monday. If it breaks, it will fly to 160 easily; then consolidate at 160 for a day or two, and then fly again to 164. **The play: 5/10 162calls for 0.39 ish.** If IWM breaks 158 this week like I think, then this will give you an excellent return. (I plan on buying 100 of these on Monday on the dip to 157, if it does in fact dip). If you have a larger account, then **5/10 160calls for 0.95ish**, which will be *very* profitable if IWM hits 160 this week. Market seems SUPER euphorically hot right now. ER's are going well. GDP was amazing. SPY looks like it will most certainly make a new ATH this week. If SPY does make a new ATH on monday, then IWM should be able to break through 158 and it will FLY.

Remember: Fed Rate cuts are a tremendous blessing to small cap businesses who want cheap debt to grow their businesses. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLottery play: NVDA. Because of the INTC miss, NVDA has already had it's pre-ER cool off and reset. If AMD and AAPL beat, I think NVDA will gain momentum. ER is on 5/16. It held its 175 support on Friday, and 175 is strong support. So if it holds, it will only consolidate or go up. So the play is a ER run up play, which will be stimulated by tech beats this week (esp AMD). **The play: PRE-ER run up 5/10 190c, since 191 has been a magnet, for 1.37ish. Or 192.50c for $0.97ish. OR for ER IV play: 5/17 200c for $1.70ish.** This last play is pretty damn exciting. NVDA's ER IV boost has not yet been priced in. The premium is currently pricing in 49% IV, but during the day before ER the IV should shoot up between 150% to 200%. So if NVDA makes it to, say, 191 ish again the week of ER, those 200c's should be much more than 1.70ish. Plus, if NVDA continues to go up, you don't have to wait till week of ER to sell either if you're happy with profits.", "created_utc": 1556404726, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bi4j18/my_picks_for_week_of_429/", "is_self": true}
