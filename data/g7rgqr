(and half-assed DD)", "selftext": "First of all I'm pissed off I have to wade through the zombie muck of front page chaff that have diluted this subreddit down to the point where it's a fucking stroked out parrot-cage of brrr, gay bear emojis, shitty ant-sized loss porn and the same two goddamn jokes. So unfortunately it falls to me to give you morons the next play that you need since everyone else is not even shitposting well enough to call it a shitpost because of your early onset dementia that can only be cured by mainlining clorox.\n\nMeat prices are going to skyrocket in the next two weeks. This is because Brazil, which exports meat in giant chunky gobs, has selfishly decided to die from coronavirus. The second problem is that meat packing plants in America are shut down because the Guadalupe refugees working there can't stop coughing on your USDA prime and the USDA inspectors can't stop coughing on the Guadalupe refugees.\n\nBut because of the fact that beef and pork farms are going to need to move animals. Cows and pigs eat a fucking lot of food. I would give you numbers but you innumerate fucking college sophomores can't read anyway so suffice it to say that UNPROCESSED MEAT PRICES will go DOWN like FUCKING OIL and PROCESSED MEAT PRICES WILL GO UP because no one is fucking processing meat. Do you know what this means? There's a massive processing bottleneck that is going to mean meat processing plants are going to start rolling in Walter White levels of cash. The few plants that are still processing meat are going to make bank.\n\nBut, this also means that in the next 3 weeks you're going to see the meat ETF COW tank. This is because farmers can't move cattle or pigs, they're still going to be birthing the same amount that they were because gestation periods for meat animals are between 3-6 months. I.E. farmers pumped up the pig fucking back in January when the economy is good and now you can't find enough wire hangers to end these burgerlings and baconlings when they pop out. Food costs are through the roof, no one is processing meat, and essentially farmers are having to waste their meat or overspend hoping that processing spins back up.\n\nNow, get this. We have summer coming up and no one is gonna be outdoors grilling. People don't even like cooking steaks at home. Meat prices will spike in the next week, no one has the money to buy meat, no one buys meat, no restaurant buys meat, meat processing tanks, too many cows, too many pigs, too much meat, meat prices tank, meat ETFs tank. New meat index prices are published on 5/12, so when it comes out that no one can move their cattle be prepared to watch unprocessed meat prices drop.\n\nCOW is an ETF that tracks meat futures; strangely, not just beef but pork as well. It's not actual cow futures so you don't have to take delivery. Expect that shit to drop like a rock as the bottleneck becomes more pronounced.\n\n**Positions: COW 27p 5/15 but if you want to inverse me then COW 34c 6/19**\n\nAlso please be fucking smart and don't buy cattle futures because 1 contract is for 18 metric tons of cattle and your ex-mom's step-boyfriend doesn't want you to keep 18-20 Red Angus beef steers in the guest bedroom.", "created_utc": 1587810948.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7rgqr/fuck_cows_yolo_inside_and_halfassed_dd/", "is_self": true}
