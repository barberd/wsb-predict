Analysts had estimated revenue of $1.27 billion. Consolidated comparable sales increased by **2%**.\n\n**Full-Year Results:** When it comes to Fiscal 19, there is a **7% YoY growth** to reach 4.3B (4B in 2018). Same-store comparable sales are 3%. AEO has trended upward in the previous 5 years for comparable sales.

Given their past history, it is likely they will take advantage of the low price and buy in the near term. Ultimately, this will **reduce outstanding shares by 21%.**\n\n**Financial Position:** Currently, AEO has **plenty of cash** at $416.9M and no debt, making it in excellent financial health to weather any storm. Not only that, but the company also had $206M FCF after even spending $210.4M in CAPEX.\n\n**Dividend:** Something that makes this stock highly attractive right now is it's 5.45% dividend yield. Unlike that of oil companies, AEO's dividend is safe. The plenty of liquidity and excellent FCF generation (more than 2x that of dividends) will ensure the dividend is paid even in a worst-case scenario of the coronavirus.\n\n**Growth Opportunity:**  One promising star is the Aerie lingerie retailer which is rapidly stealing sales from a declining Victoria's Secret. AEO management is super confident about the growth & the past result are clearing showing it. For fiscal 2019, Aerie revenues came in at $818.6M compared to $645.7M, helped by 33 net new store openings and comparable sales growth of 20% for a total growth rate of 26.7%.

The **excellent management team** & **fantastic growth** of it's growing brands will continue to provide solid returns. Lastly, the excellent 6% dividend yield & potential 15% earnings yield due to buybacks, make buying AEO an opportunity too good to be passed upon.\n\n**TL-DR: Buy AEO Stock (highly likely to increase at least 10-30% in next year).** \n\nReasons: Strong B/S, excellent FCF, Share buybacks, & approved dividends.\n\n**Edit 1:**  Since everyone is asking about puts, I forgot to mention, it's only like $8 a share (meaning the most it can drop is $8 and it can go up UNLIMITED) So how's that for profit potential!", "created_utc": 1584400468.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjujc4/american_eagle_outfitters_aeo_undervalued_and/", "is_self": true}
