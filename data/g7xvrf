One of the class that I've taken 3 years ago (ECE 333) talks about energy production in depth. \n\nIn our electricity grid, we have to keep the supply of power equalized with the demand so that our frequency is kept at 60 Hz. The U.S. achieves that in a variety of ways. \n\nNormally, there's a foundation power plant, combined with a number of rampers. Foundation power plants offer a fixed amount of electricity under the actual requirement while the rampers ramp up to equalize for the difference to meet the actual needs. \n\nThose foundation plants are really costly and hard to turn off. (mostly coal) During our stay home order, the demand for electricity drops so low that these foundation plants have to shut off to not fry our grid with electricity more than 60 Hz. \n\nThese plants are hard to turn off and turn on too. So after the crisis, we would pay a hefty price to get it up again. \n\nThe society will look at alternatives when it opens back up, and the old industries' flaws will be addressed. With our power needs ever changing, we would have to a higher fluctuation in power needs. That would phase out coal plants. \n\nI can see the permanent shift to nuclear, natural gas, oil and renewables due to the ramp rate. \n\nEspecially, nuclear, oil and natural gas are simply better in their intermediate ramp rate to act as a coal replacement. i.e. The foundation power plants. \n\nTrump is actually surprisingly supportive of nuclear power. I know he isn't a fan of renewable energy. Full renewables like solar, wind are not enough to act as a foundation for the society without repurposing acres of land for it. There are talks on making mini nuclear plants using new technology to limit the risk of nuclear fallouts. \n\nNow I didn't want to flag this as DD because I have not investigated much into the tickers yet and I'm wanting to leave that task with some of you who will pool together the tickers for us. \n\nThat said, puts on coal and calls on nuclear, solar... \n\nARCH puts\nCCJ, UUUU calls...\nCalls on natural gas, oil for the rebound\n\n[Trump stance on nuclear](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/10/21131701/trump-budget-proposal-nuclear-energy-programs-spending)\n\n[ramp up rates of plants](https://www.researchgate.net/post/What_is_the_typical_MW_minute_ramping_capability_for_each_type_of_reserve)\n\n[Nuclear play](https://www.powermag.com/nuclear-fuel-working-group-outlines-how-u-s-could-regain-global-leadership/)", "created_utc": 1587837103.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7xvrf/permanent_shift_in_the_energy_sector/", "is_self": true}
