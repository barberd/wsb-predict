{"id": "fdohwv", "title": "The WSB Plague", "selftext": "Think, a few weeks ago u/WSBgod posts unreal gains. WSB hits mainstream. Open the r/all r/investing r/normie floodgates.\n\nThousands of morons downloaded Robinhood and deposited their 1k life savings or student loans. In front of them was a dream. Make thousands, beat the market, easy money. Be a \"trader\". Be a bigshot.\n\nWSB does not take kindly to all the noobs, the influx disrupting the sub. Talks of going private emerge. Mainstream news articles on WSB continue to surface. \n\nRight as the noobs were flooding WSB, the SPCE posts were flowing. People cashing in big time. TSLA, SPCE.... Everything the sub touched turned to gold. They had finally found the secret society.\n\n\"stonks only go up\" \"infinite bull market\". The noobs throw all their money into calls. It's just that easy! \n\nThen, disaster strikes. The fastest drop in history. \n\nThe beer flu news finally decides to influence the market, despite the market ignoring it for weeks. Within one day, all the newcomers are down 90%. What's going on? How could this happen? Many 'buy the dip' on Friday. Little do they know, the dip has only begun. \n\nAccounts hemorrhaging, some bail for good, some revenge trade - giving even more of their parents' hard earned money to Robinhood.\n\nThe ones that were not completely wiped out - FOMO some puts. Others continue to helplessly buy dip after dip. All hope seems lost. \n\nIf life wasn't going terribly enough, the Gods continue to deal their cruel blows. Monday morning, after many noobs are forced to hold over the weekend due to a late surge during an expected mass sell off - an unprecedented yet predictable catastrophe arises. \n\nRobinhood goes down. Unbelievable. Every helpless noob sinks deeper into the red, unable to exit their positions. The market takes to one of the largest surges ever. \n\nWSB again fills with wild gain posts. All while the noobs cry in despair from the sidelines. Surely we can make it back when RH comes back? Guess what. Down a second day. Another day of massive surge. \n\nRH comes back, thousands more noob orders fill, and thousands of noobs are still holding last week's puts. Now down 99% percent. Boom. Rate cut. How could it all go so wrong? \n\nSurely nothing else could possibly go against us. We'll win eventually right? The beer virus is on a killing spree. Surely my puts will print? \n\nSPY bouncing like an EKG, record volatility. How about the second largest one day market gain ever? Right at close? Sound good? \n\nHave no fear, WSB. The purge has occurred. Your sub is saved. Never in history has a group of people been so mercilessly eradicated - as the Feb2020 WSB noobs. The fascination is over. The damage will be far reaching, long lasting. Egos and bank accounts destroyed forever.\n\nI don't know if you all believe in a higher power, but it is hard to believe the God of WSB did not deal out these plagues. To save our land from conquest. There is no other explanation for this string of unbelievable events. \n\nAnd now, to add salt to the wounds, the noobs that come to see if everyone is losing as bad as they are - see hundreds of you donating your winnings to charity. \n\nThis is a wild place.
