{"id": "g36881", "title": "PSA: Please don\u2019t do what I did because I am an idiot.", "selftext": "Hi all!\n\nI was trying to hedge a stock portfolio by shorting the market. I usually buy puts on the SPY but for some reason I felt it was too expensive and decided to instead buy the SDS etf which is a leveraged 2x short of the SPY. Well, I lost 25% in two weeks and I am so upset with myself as a result. For those who who are none the wiser, shorting using any bull market ETF has its drawbacks, especially since it resets everyday. So that reset means you are automatically losing $$ each day you hold on to it after the day you purchased it. I also let it ride much longer than I should have since it was a broken trade. I tried to hold on thinking it will swing back but the market just kept on rising. What a fool I was.  Kids, please learn from my mistakes and just buy puts if you want to short the market.", "created_utc": 1587143822.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g36881/psa_please_dont_do_what_i_did_because_i_am_an/", "is_self": true}
