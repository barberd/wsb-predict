{"id": "c015kz", "title": "Short Chegg", "selftext": "I recently had to rent a textbook online for my summer class. Naturally, as a capitalist, I checked the price between Chegg and Amazon before making the rental purchase. \n\nAmazon is beating them in price point on almost every book that is rented from both companies. \n\nBut here\u2019s the kicker, a ton of students are getting prime memberships these days (from my experience at a large university) too, so the books come with typical prime two day shipping  most of us just wanted for the membership anyways. \n\nThis is not by any means a well researched DD, just my take on things from the consumer point of view. I see a good reason to short $CHGG long term here simply based upon the fact that their rental sales will naturally decline. Unless there are rumors that Amazon flat out buys the company in the future. \n\nWill be interesting to see how their next earnings plays out especially the earnings report covering Q3 (textbook purchasing season.)\n\nThoughts fellow autists?
