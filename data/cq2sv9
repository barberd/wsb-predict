{"id": "cq2sv9", "title": "Full Short LB Thesis", "selftext": "First off, my short thesis on L Brands (LB) is primarily focused on the Victoria's Secret aspect of their business and their CEO, Les Wexner, and his undeniably suspicious connections and friendship to the recently deceased World class pedophile and child sex trafficker, Jeffery Epstein. I will be breaking down my thesis into the following main points: Overall decline of the physical retail sector general, Deteriorating business/financials, Ongoing lawsuits/investigations &amp; Key executive resignations, Low Short % and  high institutional ownership, and last and most important, Les Wexner himself.  \n\n1) The first component of my short thesis on L Brands is the simplest and most straight forward. Often times people over complicate their analysis on whatever company they are interested in, whether it be long or short. But the narrative is clear for all physical retailers, innovate or die. Everyone in the World can see that the retail sector overall has been absolutely decimated by the recent revolution and mass expansion of online platforms (Thanks Amazon). We're seeing historic companies close stores at a record rate and even go out of business completely like a childhood favorite of mine, Toys-R-Us. [Sears](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/10/15/sears-bankruptcy/1595399002/) filed Chapter 11 last fall. J.C Penny is literally a penny stock now and on the verge of complete bankruptcy. Anyone can look up the countless other examples of the declining and failing retailers in recent years. Now, I'm not in the camp of people who believe that Amazon will take over and replace all retailers completely. I do believe a few of the biggest players will adapt and survive and be able to coexist with the likes of Walmart and Amazon. In my opinion L Brands will NOT be one of those companies to survive. [Victoria's Secret](https://www.businessinsider.com/victorias-secret-stores-closing-list-2019-4) in particular is having a very rough year. Here's a novel thought, if you're a retailer and you're closing stores due to a \"decline in performance\" that you probably invested millions to open and maintain, that's not good for your business. Considering you need your stores open to sell your overpriced bras and lingerie. Don't overthink this one. Physical retail is a dying industry and only a few will survive. Even if Victoria's Secret ultimately survives, it won't be without many battle scars.  \n\n2) The next component is more of an expansion of the previous point. I mentioned innovate or die, and it seems that Victoria's Secret is [choosing](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/08/victorias-secret-is-retails-latest-fallen-angel.html) to die slowly. Although Victoria's Secret is still the main lingerie provider in the US for now, they have failed to adjust their business to account for the tens of millions of women who literally do not fit into their \"sexy\" products. How hard is it to simply make some shit for women of larger/various sizes? They sacrificed their business to try and cater to only the \"sexiest\" women and it is backfiring big time. Normally I'm not a big \"look at the balance sheet and other various financial metrics of companies\" type of person. I trade and invest using other tools, ideas, and metrics. But everyone please go and look at all their key financial metrics. Declining net income every year since 2016, declining total assets every year since 2016, increased liabilities every year since 2016, declining same store sales every year since 2016, etc. I mean fuck, just [look](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LB/chart?p=LB#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%3D%3D) at what the stock has done since it's all time peak of almost $100 in 2015. Every rally besides their sizeable rally in 2017 from ~$35-$63 ended up being a great shorting opportunity if you gave yourself at least a few months. And obviously since the highs of 2017 every rally has continued to be a great shorting opportunity. This is all despite the market going to all time highs over the same period of time. To continue with the evidence of declining business for Victoria's Secret lets look at their annual fashion show. Last year was their worst year ever as far as viewership ratings for their biggest event of the year. [This](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/victorias-secret-show-cancelled_n_5d4197c1e4b0db8affb171c3) year they flat out cancelled their annual fashion show! Remember, this is their Super Bowl. Imagine if the NFL had their worst viewership ratings of the Super Bowl one year and the very next year they decided to scrap the Super Bowl entirely for the time being. The annual fashion show typically generated large amounts of buzz and positive publicity for Victoria's Secret. To me it is a major red flag that a retail company with visibly declining sales and business who is desperate to turn around sentiment doesn't host their most important event of the year. The annual fashion show gives them their biggest stage and best chance to actually turn things around and it's not happening in 2019. They seemingly can't escape bad news event after bad news event this year.  \n \n3) Speaking of bad news, it's never a good thing to have multiple [lawsuits](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lead-plaintiff-deadline-alert-faruqi-191500020.html) against your company for potentially lying/misleading the SEC and defrauding investors. From that article \"L Brands\u2019 Victoria\u2019s Secret and PINK businesses failed to disclose their deteriorating operating performance due to, among other things, increased competition from new lingerie brands\". Now I do know that most of these types of lawsuits don't materialize into anything that affects the stock other than maybe when the news is first announced. But it's just another little piece of the pie that is in favor of the shorts. Although I personally think it's unlikely, there could be news any given day about a fine from the SEC or a forced payout to investors for their actions. Any of us who are already in position with shorts will potentially benefit immediately should these lawsuits actually materialize into a negative news event for LB.  \n \n*[Here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shareholder-alert-zuo-omcl-lb-134420394.html)  \n\n+[Here] (https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shareholder-notice-brodsky-smith-llc-105000074.html)  \n\n-[Here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shareholder-alert-claimsfiler-reminds-egbn-025000241.html) are some of the other few lawsuit updates I've seen recently.   \n\nDid you really think the bad news ended there? Their Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) who has been with the company since the early 1980's happened to [resign](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/05/victorias-secrets-l-brands-is-losing-its-marketing-chief.html) about a week ago. Only the CEO Les Wexner has been with the company longer. When I see executives stepping down/resigning I always try to see if there is any writing on the wall about a negative environment they're trying to avoid going forward. This looks to be a textbook case of that. Company facing serious declining business? Check. Company recently cancelled their biggest event of the year? Check. Company facing multiple class action lawsuits? Check. Company CEO caught up in a potentially massive child sex trafficking scandal? Check, and we'll get much more into that soon. To me it couldn't be more obvious that this CMO sees an impossible to win environment for Victoria's Secret/LB and decided it's best to get out now before the final hammer really comes down on them.  \n \n4) The last point regarding just their business/stock price has to do with their short float % and institutional ownership. [LB] (http://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/LB.htm) has a 6.66% short interest and a 70-75% institutional ownership. Their CEO owns about 17% of the shares himself as well. I'm not sure how familiar y'all are with short interest in retail stocks. But it is pretty much standard to see 20-40%+ short interest in any given retail stock. It hasn't been a secret for years that physical retailers are under serious threat and thus many people have the same idea to short these types of companies. But L Brands short % stands at less than 7%. This is another positive catalyst for those who are short this dying company. Everyone should be familiar with the concept of a short squeeze. The upside in a short squeeze is only magnified the greater the amount of people that are short that company. But considering L Brands has an extremely low short interest compared to most other retailers L Brands is more \"protected\" from experiencing an extreme short squeeze if unexpected good news were to drop. Although I can't foresee any positive news catalysts in the near future, they do report earnings on 8/21 after hours. Earnings reports as we all know can produce any result imaginable. We will probably see a move ranging from -30% to +30% or anything in between. Although it's hard to see LB producing a good quarter after the year they've had so far, anything is possible and I'm not a degenerate moron who is Yolo'ing on weekly options like most of /r/WSB. Now, taking a look at the 70-75% institutional ownership you can analyze it from a few different perspectives. From my perspective it is both good and bad that this stock is primarily owned by institutions. It is good for us LB bears in the sense that if any of these institutions decide to exit, LB will come down significantly since the institutions own the majority of the shares and are really the ones that control the stock price. On the other hand, institutions that have access to millions, or billions of dollars of capital may take the opposite stance as me on LB. Perhaps some analyst at these institutions may want to double or triple down on their LB position. Maybe they'll come out with a price target upgrade next month. Who knows. But those are legitimate possibilities and we have to be careful because we can be crushed at any moment if one of these dumbass institutions pours in large amounts of capital to buy up LB. But they have access to the same information (and more) than I do so hopefully they see the same writing on the wall for LB.  \n \n5) The last and most important point in the Short LB Thesis is about their CEO, Les Wexner. As most of you know, leadership of a company is one of the most important components when determining a company's success. I will warn anyone reading this now that this is going to get very dark and controversial now. All I ask is that you just make it to the end and use your critical thinking skills to form your own opinion after I lay out the facts about Wexner. By now I'm sure everyone has heard of the disgusting, vile Jeffrey Epstein. If you have not, please go and read everything you can to catch up on his situation. Epstein was a World class child sex trafficker and pedophile. He has direct connections to people like Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew from the royal family, Kevin Spacey, and many, many others. We're only focused on Epstein's connection and relationship to Wexner in this thesis. Epstein also suspiciously committed \"suicide\" recently before he was able to see trial. [This] (https://www.thecut.com/2019/07/les-wexner-jeffrey-epstein-victorias-secret.html) article is a must read and does a phenomenal job of highlighting the nature of the multi decade long relationship between Epstein and Wexner. To summarize some of the main points. Wexner seemed to have \"discovered\" Epstein and made him his money manager at some point in the 1980's, despite Epstein having no prior history of managing large amounts of capital. Wexner even made [Epstein] (https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/business/jeffrey-epstein-wexner-victorias-secret.html) his power of attorney in 1991, meaning Epstein had basically full control over the billions that Wexner had accumulated and was free to spend how he saw fit. Recently, Wexner has tried his best to distance himself from Epstein and pretends that they weren't as close as they really were. When in fact he referred to Epstein as his [protege.] (https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/11/garden/home-sweet-elsewhere.html?module=inline). Wexner purchased one of the largest most expensive properties in New York in 1995 and simply gave it to Epstein for no amount of money? Huh, that's interesting. Now is where we have to begin to make deeper connections and go where right into the heart of darkness. Wexner [told us] (https://www.businessinsider.com/l-brands-ceo-regretted-crossing-paths-with-jeffrey-epstein-2019-7?r=US&amp;IR=T) recently that he was \"NEVER\" aware of any of the crimes that Epstein was committing these last few decades. Let's all take a step back and think logically. Les Wexner is trying to tell us he was completely ignorant of the fact that the man who he has known for decades, the man who he gave power of attorney to, the man he called his protege, was running the Worlds biggest most insane child sex trafficking ring right under his nose and he had absolutely no knowledge? There are only 2 conclusions you can draw from Les Wexner's statement. Either Wexner is a complete oblivious moron who was somehow unaware that one of his closest friends was one of the biggest criminals of all time. Or, what I believe, he knew the entire time and was complicit in some of these crimes related to Epstein. [This](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/jeffrey-epstein-allegedly-preyed-victoria-184517408.html) article gives some credence to my belief that Wexner was complicit and perhaps even helped facilitate Epstein's child sex trafficking operation. How could Jeffery Epstein gain access to underage models from Victoria's Secret to rape and traffic without someone high up complicity helping him? Perhaps someone other than Wexner could have been helping Epstein gain access to Victoria's Secrets underage models, but there was no one closer to Epstein than Wexner in Victoria's Secret hierarchy and so it only makes sense that he was helping him and also helping him cover it up. Like I said, this is very dark and fucked up, but all I care about is the truth, regardless of how it makes me feel emotionally. Only time will tell if Wexner proves to be an innocent moron, or a world class criminal like his buddy Epstein. Thankfully the Attorney General Bill Barr is [looking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YBlFgWvAdI&amp;feature=youtu.be) into all the people associated with Epstein. They will not get away with their crimes just because of Epstein's death.  \n     \nTo summarize my short thesis on LB, it is clear that L Brand's Victoria's Secret business is rapidly declining on many different fronts. They have failed to innovate and are suffering serious tangible consequences because of it. They face numerous lawsuits because of their sketchy reporting about their declining business. Their shitty stock chart and declining key financial metric speak for itself. At least 1 key executive has stepped down recently amid all the recent negative news and controversy about their CEO Les Wexner. Les Wexner himself has/had an extremely close relationship with World class child sex trafficker and pedophile Jeffery Epstein. There is some evidence that Wexner may have used Victoria's Secret in a way to aid Jeffery Epstein in his child sex trafficking operation. I don't have all the answers now, but if my assumptions about Les Wexner are correct what do you think is going to happen to L Brands/Victoria's Secret if news comes out that Wexner was complicit and he used Victoria's Secret in the process? Who would ever want to shop there again? God forbid, what if Wexner was also a major pedophile himself? To me this would be catastrophic for the already failing business. A final nail in the coffin. I hope I'm wrong about Wexner. I'm just afraid the facts point me to believe he is a very evil and fucked up individual. At the end of the day, we all just want to make money and my analysis of LB and their CEO led me to believe this is still an incredible short, even after coming down over 60% from their 2015 highs and coming down close to 20% in the last 1-2 months. If you're going to short get November puts at the earliest but preferably January Puts or further out. If i'm right about Wexner and the scandal coming, it's going to take some time to play out. If you wanna say fuck it and yolo a small % of your capital on an earning's miss, go ahead, just don't think that it's guaranteed that the company is going to collapse double digit percent on their earnings report next week. I started shorting LB immediately about 6 weeks ago when I learned of Wexner's extremely suspicious connections to Epstein after his arrest. Only time will prove me right or wrong now. God bless and good luck to those who join me on this LB short journey.", "created_utc": 1565746529, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cq2sv9/full_short_lb_thesis/", "is_self": true}
