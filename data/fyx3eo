{"id": "fyx3eo", "title": "Market Analogy", "selftext": "February's market was the exact same as the titanic. Investors liked to say we were in a recession proof economy. Donald reinforced the same thing. \n\nFast forward two months and its the complete opposite. Bears and bulls both confused about whats going to happen. \n\nTo keep things short for you, look at the picture below and place your trades how you see fit. \n\nWhen a ship sinks it doesnt just go straight down, that'd be too quick and anticlimactic. The hull will lift up to show the underbelly. Nose points up, and a slow death if you will to the ship and everyone on board.\n\nThe same thing is happening to the economy. Donnie and JPow are lifting the markets up before the inevitable sink kicks in. They can bring all the life rafts they want by pumping, but there is no way that the market can stay propped up on paper mache stilts.\n\nNo telling on how much further we have to go up, but there is no way we have bottomed out already.\n\nThanks for coming to my TED Talk.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m2eypwzxg4s41.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe6b7299c73b651c684b85f5ec21c0e64c83b173", "created_utc": 1586582271.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fyx3eo/market_analogy/", "is_self": true}
