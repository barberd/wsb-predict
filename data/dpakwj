{"id": "dpakwj", "title": "How did BYND collapse even though everyone expected it?", "selftext": "Usually when everyone knows the same thing (like lockup expiration), it's priced in. But not this time.\n\nI was looking to buy some puts because I hate these chemical burgers and I just think they were over valued.\n\nSo I pulled the trigger on Sep 25, buying $85 puts Nov 1 expiration.\n\nOf course they announced McD partnership literally next day. So it made me scared to double down. I started thinking like \"Yea I am not the only genius. People know about it the lockup. It won't go down\"\n\nRegardless, stock collapsed like crazy. I sold my puts early for small a profit since I panicked for being under for so long.\n\nLiterally everyone knew the lockup was coming, competition etc. So I thought this might actually go up after earnings. But it happened exactly like I initially thought it would. And I somehow lost money after FOMO buying more puts recently.\n\nSo my question is, maybe people don't consider these things far ahead? Even Cramer started talking about it like last week. Maybe you actually know something that most people don't and gotta be more confident?", "created_utc": 1572459808, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpakwj/how_did_bynd_collapse_even_though_everyone/", "is_self": true}
