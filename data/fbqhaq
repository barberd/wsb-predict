This week the VIX hit its **highest point in almost 9 YEARS** and whaddya know... this weekend we're treated to a ton of converted gaylords who bought their puts on Friday morning hyping up every possible piece of beer virus noise to feel better about their poor choices in life. The same people who were somehow able to ignore every piece of beer virus news the five days between getting approved on RH to buy a gaytarded $200 MSFT FD and getting completely screwed to a 0$ account balance this week.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/DM6kdBD](https://imgur.com/a/DM6kdBD)\n\n**Guess what. You're about to get screwed again.** That cash withdrawal you made on Friday from your credit card so you could buy a put? Probably already worthless. And before you start whining about market manipulation like you did after the last time you made an \"investment\" (let me take a wild guess, .069420 of a BTC on Dec 17 2017?) here's a history lesson so you can prime your stupid asshole for more pain.\n\nHere are all the times in the past 12 years when Vix crossed 30: [https://imgur.com/a/zj9FpwM](https://imgur.com/a/zj9FpwM)\n\n**Dec 2018** \\- Vix peaks at 36 and next day immediate one day 6.6% rally off of the previous days close\n\n**Feb 5 2018** \\- Vix peaks at 38 next day opens lower but rallies 4% from the open in one day\n\n**Feb 7 2018** \\- Vix peaks at 33.5 and rallies 8.5% over the next five days\n\n**Aug 2015** \\- Vix peaks at 41 and rallies 12.3% over the next four days\n\n**Aug 2011** \\- Vix peaks at 49 and next day rallies 5% from open\n\n**Also Aug 2011** \\- Vix peaks at 45.5 and rallies 7.5% over the next 3 days\n\n**May 2010** \\- Vix peaks at 41 and opens with a gap and rallies 5.3% from previous days close\n\n**Also May 2010** \\- Vix peaks at 46.5 and rallies 7% over the next 7 days, but with some shake out candles thrown in.\n\n**\"But what about 2008 you stupid retard?\"** Vix peaks at 36.5, market gaps open the next day and rallies 9% in two days. Then the world plunges into chaos. But guess what? Every subsequent peak in Vix is followed by a bear rally forcing low conviction retards with no collateral to cover their asses.\n\nDon't say you weren't warned if we have a 5% day on Monday. I'm bearish overall for the next 12 months but if you think markets go straight down you're gonna get wrecked.\n\n**TLDR: Ur puts might be shit I don't even know why I went to the effort of making this post when you're just going to call it retarded.**", "created_utc": 1583046136, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fbqhaq/all_the_ways_vix_will_fuck_you_this_week/", "is_self": true}
