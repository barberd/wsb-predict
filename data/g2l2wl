{"id": "g2l2wl", "title": "$18.5M Insider Purchase at MGM (Unusual Insider Activity at MGM Resorts)", "selftext": "***\\*Removed all links to SEC filings and such because I can't figure out which ones are allowed\\****\n\nYo!\n\nWe made a tool that analyzes the thousands of Form 4s filed each day to analyze all of the \"unusual\" insider activity (essentially any insider stock grants, buys, or sells, that are not easily explained away by things like yearly bonuses, performance awards, incentive plans, 10b5-1 plans, etc).\n\nIt is still a relatively new tool but has had some decent findings so far by finding $SLRX and $YTEN before they made huge announcements about a new patent and a new corn breakthrough which increased their stock prices by 27% and 43% respectively (and then they got crushed by coronavirus, but nothing you can do about that). \n\n### MGM Resorts International ($MGM) - Insider Purchases\n\nFrom Yahoo Finance:\n\n>MGM Resorts International, through its subsidiaries, owns and operates integrated casino, hotel, and entertainment resorts in the United States and Macau.\n\nAs to be expected, MGM was demolished during the market crash falling from \\~$33 at the start of 2020 to a low of $7.14 on 3/18 (a 78% decline). They have since recovered to a closing price of $15.00 on April 8th, but clearly have a long way to go to get back to their stock price from the beginning of the year.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xrbyn7d888t41.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf075e7872c2f2fdb2466ddcc4092a90403d9ac1\n\nThe recent Form 4 activity shows some insider purchasing activity, including a huge $18.5M purchase by Corvex Management (through Keith Meister, who is a director for MGM). \n\nThe CEO and CFO were the only executives that made purchases, and they weren\u2019t particularly large, but we do see that a couple of Directors made very sizeable stock purchases.\n\n*\\*Note, Keith Meister made the $18.5M purchase on behalf of Corvex Management. Also, these \u201cTotal Shares\u201d numbers represent the total shares in the \u201caccount\u201d they are making the purchase for. Most of these are in their \u201cdirect account\u201d (if the stock type is \u201ccommon\u201d, then it is in their \u201cdirect account), but they could also have trusts or accounts for family members that aren\u2019t included.\\** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i7dn4c4a88t41.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=521ace523f0d7e2e7177e8b4ecdd9046490b0607\n\nThe individual Form 4s show that none of the purchasing activity was part of any previously arranged plan.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f6nshxqb88t41.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=582759da6db38abd2ae6f939289e06671d890c49\n\nMGM recently put out a Proxy Statement and verified that they have ownership guidelines requiring their CEO to own 5x his salary in stock, the other executives to own 2x, and the Directors to own 5x their cash retainer. We aren\u2019t going to list out all of the requirements here because they announced that as of December 31, 2019, all executives and directors owned the amount required (except for their new President of Commercial & Growth who is on track to meet his requirement).\n\nWe didn\u2019t see many executives making purchases over the last few weeks and it is possible the CEO and CFO were just making purchases to help ensure they are over their ownership requirement guidelines by the end of the year, but we also saw some very large purchases by Directors that may indicate that MGM is a company worth looking into. After falling almost 80%, they definitely have a lot of room to recover if they can make it out of this downturn in good shape.", "created_utc": 1587063264.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2l2wl/185m_insider_purchase_at_mgm_unusual_insider/", "is_self": true}
