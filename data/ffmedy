On Friday I saw that airplane stocks were up because warren buffet bought 48 billion of delta so I put all of my money into UAL calls expiring next week friday. I saw a post today about futures being bad and was wondering if this meant that only SPY would go down since it is the s and p coordinate. Will UAL still go up since buffet and white huose?\n\nLast week gains for reference: [https://imgur.com/a/BADpxK7](https://imgur.com/a/BADpxK7)", "created_utc": 1583715074, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffmedy/possbible_miscalculation_error/", "is_self": true}
