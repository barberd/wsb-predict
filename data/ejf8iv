Working in our favor is WW3 with Iran, Russian, and China, which means there are probably a lucrative Pentagon contracts being drafted for $BA right now that will more than wipe out their shitty 2019. However, oil is about to moon so the commercial flight sector is probably about to nosedive, especially after Russia inevitably shoots one out of the air like they do at least once per conflict. I'm bullish and think the government contracts more than compensate, but how are you guys playing this?", "created_utc": 1578057169, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ejf8iv/how_to_play_ba_for_the_impending_ww3/", "is_self": true}
