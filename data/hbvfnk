Q2 earnings are going to be good as well and it will have a huge run up till earnings.\n\nIf 2nd wave of covid 19 causes more travel restrictions, oil tankers would be in demand as well.\n\nLooking at the chart, it is bouncing of 8.30$. Double bottom here. Triple if you consider bounce off of 8.40 during march. This runs up pretty fast from this support point.  Expecting at least 20% pop from these levels. I am in 1k shares  at 8.48.\n\nExpecting high Div announcement during next ER. Buy it when you can.\n\nFirst DD. Pardon if it's too mundane or if I missed anything.\n\nGLTA!!!", "created_utc": 1592547245.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hbvfnk/eurn_oil_tanker_play_double_triple_bottom_chart/", "is_self": true}
