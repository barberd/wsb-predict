{"id": "giowg1", "title": "PLT Earnings Play (TL;DR included)", "selftext": "This is a very conservative play, yet it has enough WSB potential to moon. Just bought into this position today listening to u/AveenoFresh and I'm already up 25%. To give a brief description of this company:\n\n\"Plantronics, Inc. engages in the design, manufacture, and distribution of headsets, voice, video, and content sharing solutions. Its product include enterprises headsets, consumer headsets, voice video, and content sharing solutions. The company was founded by Courtney Graham and Keith Larkin in 1961 and is headquartered in Santa Cruz, CA.\"\n\nEssentially, this is another tech company that specializes in audio/video. If we look at two similar competitors in the tech sector, LOGI and HEAR, they both had substantial gains leading up to their earnings. LOGI went up on news of good earnings, and HEAR shit the bed after earnings. To play it safe, buy calls and sell leading into earnings. \n\nPLT $15c 6/19 DD:\n\nBear case - \n\nThey did have minor supply chain related disruptions in Mexico, however, analysts project Q1 earnings to be optimistic for this company. Gloomy long-term economic outlook.\n\nIt falls upon earnings release because of guidance, despite having a significant run-up (like HEAR). This still means you can make money before official earnings.\n\nBull case - \n\nGood earnings report (which is almost a guarantee) \n\nDemand for technologies in this sector have been up as a result of remote work and learning for the global populace. Everyone and their grandma is using webcams and microphones because of the quarantine. \n\nThe company cut the recent dividend and has $250M cash liquid: AKA no interim liquidity issues. Personally, the price might fluctuate throughout the week, but we should easily exceed a target threshold price of $16 by earnings given volatility. Despite the increase in volume from 300 to 3300 on the 6/19 $15c, it still isn't late to get in on this position. PLT ended the day in the green, despite the Dow and S&P falling on news of the politics between China and Trump. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR PLT 6/19 $15c\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCredits: u/AveenoFresh \n\nThis guy has diamond hands, his track record is impeccable.
