FUCK THOSE AUTISTS. *This is wsb where we try to make everyone money.* \n\n1. CPB is a COVID play. They had a earnings around March 6th, so they have their next earnings coming up on June 3rd. The reason why this is big and will draw attention and hype is because this earnings quarter will literally account in ONLY COVID TIME PERIOD SALES. Literally has the most potential for a run-up and guess what? Since earnings are 3 weeks away, the run up is only starting.\n\n2. Debunking past comments of \"Oh its at past corona times\". No shit Sherlock, but have you looked at the 5 year chart? This has hit 60 before and had a huge crash and is now on a reversal. Also Covid is most likely going to help in this reversal by increasing sales as every store was fucking sold out late March and sales are still going up. IDFC if we are at pre-corona levels because this stock benefits from it.\n\n3. PAST 6 EARNINGS HAVE BEEN BEAT BTW\n\n4. AMAZING PIPELINE like goldfish, milano crackers, soups(no shit), Prego sauce, lots of more nice shit. https://images.app.goo.gl/14Prh5ddijz2GX9v5 \n\n5. Calls are fucking cheap. Just got my position this \nmorning and have been urging and talking to people to have gotten one on Monday. I'm not being a sly fag, do the DD yourself as well and you will see what is in *store* fore us. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlright time for positions: 6/5 56.5C     6/5 55c\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs you can see I am selling right before earnings so I am not completely retarded.", "created_utc": 1589306021.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gigdpt/retarded_cpb_dd_for_yall/", "is_self": true}
