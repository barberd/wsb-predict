{"id": "fnbq1t", "title": "RISKY - SPY Put Calendar Spread @ 220", "selftext": "I feel like I've made a huge mistake and am le fucked.\n\nWhat I did: Buy SPY put @ 220 4/3, Sell SPY put @ 220 3/23 at Friday's high point (didn't get witched). I did this because the covered sale helped offset the buy premiums.\n\n\"Oh fuck\" moment: SPY dropped to 228 (226 during AH), and it looks like tomorrow is going to be red. I could get assigned on the short leg, which RH will handle by closing out my long leg (I'll lose my premium), but will knock me out of the game for days (since I will be 110k in the hole temporarily).\n\nQuestion: What is the right move here to maximize tendies and/or reduce risk of losing both contracts due to early assignment?\n\n1. Close the whole spread first thing tomorrow so I can reap solid tendies before the short leg goes ITM and I'm at early assignment risk? \n2. Close the short leg and hold onto the long leg, for potential larger gainz? \n3. Wait to see what the market does and close out the spread or short leg if it starts to go red? My concern here is trying to time this, the market dropping fast and I'm unable to close the contracts in time (and then get exercised).", "created_utc": 1584928076.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fnbq1t/risky_spy_put_calendar_spread_220/", "is_self": true}
