{"id": "fjh9a9", "title": "Macroeconomics, inflation and the Fed", "selftext": "Lot of confusion here about money printing by Feds leading to inflation etc. While it is true that money-printing can lead to hyper-inflation, but we need to look at it from a more fundamental perspective. \n\nThe first most important question to ask what is the currency that is being printed and what is it backed by? This is where we flaunt our huge USD dicks. USD is the predominant reserve currency in the world, countries essentially trust the almighty dollar, which then results in other currencies being backed by some sort of USD collateral. Most respectable central banks around the world have forex reserves in USD to back up not only their currency but also inter country transactions. This is where the Fed can literally have no limits on being jacked to the tits on printing money. Here is where it gets interesting, since most of the securities in the World have dollar as the underlying medium, if the US economy and dollar collapse, that will trigger a financial meltdown like none other virtually shaking the foundation of modern economics. \n\nFor more information on Global banking, Fed repo etc, read this well researched post: \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fe5s7e/the_fed_repos_are_an_attempt_to_prop_up_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nNow one might say hey but that makes it very unfair and it seems like the US fed can fucking do whatever they want. Yes this is correct, they will. because they are the fucking makers of u/WSBGod; they are the WorldStreetBankingGod\nTherefore the World losing confidence in the dollar is a very weak argument. \n\nFor further understanding on why collapse of dollar is unlikely, please read the article below:\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex-currencies/091416/what-would-it-take-us-dollar-collapse.asp\n\n\nNow coming to the meat of the argument about printing money leading to inflation which is partially true but not really, remember QE around the world in developed countries (especially the ones with strong currencies) has never resulted monetary inflation that the economists know of, but asset price inflation (including equity) is a different story. This is where i think there might be a concern of an impeding global financial crisis. Below are the articles which talk about inflation, QE etc\n\nhttps://wolfstreet.com/2018/10/09/why-did-qe-money-printing-not-cause-consumer-price-inflation/\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/022615/why-didnt-quantitative-easing-lead-hyperinflation.asp\n\nAs the first article states, asset price inflation is the real danger here and rightly mentions that \u201cThis is why QE cannot be maintained without setting the stage for another, and much bigger and even more magnificent collapse of the financial system, the Big One if you will, and all the real-economy mayhem it would entail\u201d\n\nNow the feds and other central banks around the world have learnt key lessons from the 2008 financial crisis and with the banks now being more connected than ever before in a global economy, everyone will be looking to the Fed to lead them out of the bear-hole when we get to it. I think people really underestimate the power of the Federal reserve and are really autsitic if they think that a bat flu will take SPY to $0. The fact that we are still the most dominant economy in the World coupled with the USD being the reserve currency gives Fed a free hand to print money without any credibility crisis as long as they use that as the last measure to stop the \u201cGLOBAL\u201d economic crisis. Note that the key word here is global, because when the whole world is on fire, nobody bothers much about whether you started the fire as long as you are also the one who is extinguishing it. Another article to help understand this point is the one below:\n\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/7562d1dc-bbb3-11e5-bf7e-8a339b6f2164\n\nTL;DR: Don\u2019t fight the Feds, they can print money, will print money and will get away with printing money to start the next bull run. Most macroeconomic theories and historical examples don\u2019t apply to the US since we are both the creator and the player in the game. Markets might sell-off in short-term, but long term will go up as long as the Feds and the US government don\u2019t create a credibility crisis domestically and internationally. Don\u2019t go all in on puts, because you be up against a very formidable force in the Federal reserve and the US Government.\n\nPS: I am not an economist but definitely an Autist.
