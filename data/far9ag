It\u2019s time to make the ultimate retarded play to salvage tendies. Now believe me when I tell you.....\n\nTHIS CAN NOT GO TITS UP.\n\nWe can capitalize on the nationwide panic that Fox News is spreading to the boomers. My SO\u2019s parents are already worried about how much their 401ks have dipped. I predict we have at least 1-2 more weeks before daddy trump declares the corona virus \u201ccontained\u201d, the boomers feel safe, and stonks will resume their rightful place of going up.  In the meantime, here\u2019s our ultimate autist play. \n\nWe buy calls on 3x leveraged bear ETFs. \n\n3/20 calls on SPXS is looking extra crispy. In the past week it\u2019s gone up 41.18 %, and still remains affordable  at $16 a share.  By March 6 it will easily hit $20. \n\nSo all aboard the tendy train! And remember, it\u2019s not gay if we all do it. It\u2019s only gay if you don\u2019t do it.", "created_utc": 1582875996, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/far9ag/the_corona_virus_turned_me_into_a_gay_bull/", "is_self": true}
