{"id": "grof27", "title": "PLT 6/19 Calls", "selftext": "Whats up people. I came as a Good Samaritan sharing my technical analysis with you all.\n\nPLT has been roaming around the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level and is ready to break through to at least to $16.98 right below the 106.18% level. Price has been bouncing around 61.8% and 78.6% for quite a while, today earnings will be the catalyst to push far through the latter level.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe move? $15C 6/19. Thank me later.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l1otp7pzfc151.png?width=2378&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef8fb138910ba6750ae6ef32deb8a21cc88e6e7b", "created_utc": 1590601365.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/grof27/plt_619_calls/", "is_self": true}
