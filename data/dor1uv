{"id": "dor1uv", "title": "Long $BYND", "selftext": "Beyond Meat BYND is down like 17% as I write this. They had a lockout period that expired today during which some 75% of their shares could not be traded. Now they can be, and early investors, even at $80 a share when it was just $105 at close yesterday, were able to sell for like 300% profit. \n\nThe company's ER yesterday showed could numbers, first profit since going public, raised guidance, everything an investor looking to buy wants from a company. The drop is from the profit seeking sell-off now that the lockout is lifted. \n\nThere are worries about the company running into competition and I'm sure Tyson or someone will buy them out eventually or they'll lose some major contract like Stamps.com did or whatever, but for the current quarter, its a good buy. \n\nThis ain't no weekly though, more like a monthly. I got $120 and $130 strikes at 12/06 and 12/20. \n\nI fully expect a $130 target price by Xmas.", "created_utc": 1572361343, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dor1uv/long_bynd/", "is_self": true}
