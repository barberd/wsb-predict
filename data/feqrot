Anyways this article just came out in Cell \n\n\nhttps://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30229-4\n\nI'm no expert, but it looks like it says Foipan (approved in Japan) made by Ono Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. would be a fairly good treatment for Covid both potentially to control lung infection and to limit transmission. \n\nThe stock is apparently traded in Japan and OTC but with a low volume on OTC (OPHLY) It looks like the market cap is high enough that I'm not breaking rules.\n\n Anyways I have no idea whether I'm right on this and can't figure out how to trade it in RH or TD except on OTC so if anyone can let me know. I also tagged this as a shit post because I have no idea if I'm right or how to make money from it and can't find the options button.\n\nEdit: changed to discussion flair after reading rules.\n\nEdit2: hopefully fixed link", "created_utc": 1583559009.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/feqrot/potential_coronavirus_antiviral_foipan/", "is_self": true}
