There will be continued pressure but likely some agreement with opec or US committing to consume from its own suppliers.  \n\nThese companies are down 50-80% in the past two weeks.  Many of these companies will default or get bought out.  \n\nI chose OAS because they have strong operating income, low debt, good cash flow, few employees, and low G&amp;A expense ratio.  \n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/those-purchased-oasis-petroleum-nasdaq-151750100.html\n\nThey\u2019ve been aggressively managing their expenses while improving the efficiency of their operations.  \n\nI recognize nobody here wants to buy leaps two years out, but it\u2019s likely one of the best opportunities right now with the volatility we have.  \n\ntl;dr.
