But there's always tomorrow, and tomorrow will be green, my friend. \n\nYou celebrated on the way up before the JPOW video, and you cried as SPY plummeted. You kept thinking to yourself \"Why didn't I take stock tips from my wife's boyfriend? I'm such a fool!\" You aren't a fool, and your wife's boyfriend's job is to fuck your wife, not to give you stock tips. It's your job to earn them both tendies. And you will, if you have some stones. I'll tell you why -- we know something these other gay bears don't.\n\nStonks only go up.\n\nHistorically, these Fed press conferences have caused very spiky days and then a strong surge upwards. You're wondering why Jerome Powell kept seeming to say a bunch of really positive things, and the market wasn't responding. He mentioned his \"tools,\" how inflation will remain steady, that job loss could have been worse, and that we should get back to normal. He mentioned that the Fed will keep buying bonds at the current pace, interest rates will stay at near-zero for \"as long as it takes,\" and that you should go to sleep soundly tonight with dreams of the fat gains on your calls. This all sounded great to you, right? Then, the reporters started throwing some hard balls at JPow. \n\nThey asked about things like \"have we hit the bottom?\" \"Is this the next Great Depression?\" \"DAE Inflation when print munny 2 mutch?\" \"Should we buy ammunition in droves?\" \n\nAll of a sudden, your portfolio is down bigly. What the hell happened?\nYou're forgetting one crucial piece of information.\n\nStonks only go up.\n\nThe market has historically gone up bigly in the days FOLLOWING a JPow sesh, but NOT ON THE DAY ITSELF. That's a crucial point. I know, you're not convinced yet. Sit with me a little longer before you go full gaybear.\n\nThe reason Robinhood has been IN THE FUCKING NEWS LATELY is because we move 50% of the market just on our autistic options trading alone. If this press conference had been after hours, this bitch would be popping. Don't worry, it'll pop, but we all have to remember that there is power in our sheer numbers. We will use our retard strength to lift the market. Hell, we're already up even just in the aftermarket. Why do you think? Because stocks just took a nice juicy dive, and now people want back in. \n\nSo, when you feel like you're drowning, just remember; repeat \"stonks only go up\" to yourself three times in the mirror, jerk off, then buy some calls at open. \n\nTl;Dr: STONKS ONLY GO UP!", "created_utc": 1591821622.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h0jp18/stonks_only_go_up/", "is_self": true}
