Papa Powell\u2019s vagina is leaking beyond measure which means he\u2019s going to cut rates in September.\n\nSeeing as real rates are already approaching 0% when you account for inflation, people are getting about as much action from yield as \nu/1R0NYMAN has gotten from his wife in the past 6 months. \n\nHistorically, this compression of real rates has dramatically driven the price of gold up. Now, I know what you\u2019re thinking, \u201cthis fuckin retard is pitching me gold after it\u2019s made a 10% run up MTD\u201d.

It takes a child with autism to raise the consciousness of the village.\u201d \n\nThat is what I\u2019m doing here today folks. We\u2019ve run a model which compares y/y change in real yields and the dollar and it\u2019s shown an 11.32% upside in the price of gold over the next 5 months. \n\nUnzip your fucking pants and buy some futures fellas.", "created_utc": 1562896356, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cc4l0z/were_buying_gold/", "is_self": true}
