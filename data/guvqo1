Based on how well Zscaler did in their earnings I think Crowdstrike is gonna hit it out of the park with their first profit since they IPOd about a year ago. Sadly IV has shot through the roof already, so you probably won't get gains like this. I think its got another 5-20% gain left in it. My sell target is 105.\n\n[Proof](https://preview.redd.it/xihtntqzud251.png?width=957&format=png&auto=webp&s=866feff94719af556eb72b4041507a65cde845f3)", "created_utc": 1591054289.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/guvqo1/crwd_gain_porn_30100_23795_earnings_tomorrow/", "is_self": true}
