{"id": "eiu8rw", "title": "Is this year going to be TSMC\u2019s first time selling wafers to AMD for consoles?", "selftext": "We all know how well consoles usually sell and this could also dramatically increases TSMC\u2019s revenue this year. We already have 5g, AMD 7nm PC chips, and now every ps5 and Xbox series x will have chips using TSMC\u2019s 7nm process. Remember, each console will be using a cpu chip and a gpu chip from AMD. Almost certain both will be from the 7nm process. Like this is literally a brand new revenue stream for TSMC this year. There shouldn\u2019t be any shortage of 7nm wafers too since Apple is moving onto TSMC\u2019s 5nm process this year. We know a sht ton more consoles are sold compared to the DIY market for PC.\n\nTLDR: All in call TSMC 2020.", "created_utc": 1577944528, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eiu8rw/is_this_year_going_to_be_tsmcs_first_time_selling/", "is_self": true}
