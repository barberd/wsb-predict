Do with the information what you will. \n\nPosition of the week: CL calls short-term, CL puts Long Term. \n\nAs always, the following is the stuff I don't see being mentioned in the regular media, that might be interesting for the people here, intermixed with some personal observation and opinion. \n\nYou don't like it? Don't read it. \n\nIt was thought that OPEC had a deal. Turns out that Mexico really doesn't want to cut production. \nAfter a U.S. offer to cut production (that was already naturally cut...)\nIt seemed that a deal was back on the table, it's still not official, but it looks like the Saudis blinked and Mexico gets their way.\n\nThe G-20 also seems unable to agree on any significant cuts. \n- Note that this is all posturing. These cuts would happen no matter what. It's called supply and demand. \n\nThe fed has now officially stomped the bond market into submission. Volumes of trading in U.S. treasuries are basically non-existent. \n- Bad for bond traders, but might actually be good for the economy. Once the bond traders have been thoroughly stepped on, the government can finally start trying to fix parts of the market. \n\nThe nasdaq composite continues to outperform the other indices currently by almost 20%\n\n-This is only notable in that he who climbs the highest also usually falls the furthest. \nUnless the other indices are able to play catchup, we will likely see some weakness in the Nasdaq as some point, as it will need to slow down to catch the other indices.\n\nBuffett is still selling! Disclosures show that he sold 869,000 shares of NewYork Mellon bank. \n\n- Disclosures are only required when you hold more than 10% of a total companies stock. Once it drops below that number, you no longer have to disclose sales. So, we wont know until year end how much more southwest stock he has sold. \n-Buffett always says \"sell when others are greedy and buy when others are fearful.\" \n\nNasdaq short interest is now at a 10 month low. \n- You could read this as, retail investors have gone full bull. So have some investment funds. \n\nLooking at the Chicago Options exchange we can see that we are currently at the lowest level of put interest since February 20th.\n- Retail is not buying puts. Some firms arent buying as many puts.\n\n-There continues to he strong anecdotal evidence of people who have not invested formerly jumping into the market.\nAccording to google trends, the word \"stocks\" is starting to trend back up. \n\n[Google Trends Machine](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%201-m&geo=US&q=Stocks)\n\nAt the end of the day, I have come to the following conclusion:\n\nEventually stocks have to reflect the value of the companies they are an asset of. Fight or don't fight the printer, you can make money either way.\n\nBut a world where stocks that are known trash... *coughCHKcough* and after announcing they will be doing a 50/1 or a 200/1 reverse split to bleed the last of the turnip dry. They go up 5% in a week, with a peak up 20%. \n\nBe careful, because everything can change in the blink of an eye. \n\nFind value, those stocks will always perform in the long-run.", "created_utc": 1586743295.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g09lan/news_update_this_is_my_boomstick/", "is_self": true}
