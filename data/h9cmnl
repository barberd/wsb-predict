If you have better ideas/suggestions please be kind. We are all here to make money.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# TL;DR -\n\n# INVERSE ROBINHOOD\n\n(as if you needed a DD and data analytics to tell you that)", "created_utc": 1592212188.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h9cmnl/the_robinhood_top_10_daily_positions_bull_etf_rtd/", "is_self": true}
