Chinese accounting, anyone? Plus Winnie has this pesky tendency to execute people who bring him bad news, so obviously government officials would keep the total cases under wraps and only report what they absolutely have to.\n\n3) If a 0.8% mortality rate is assumed for China as well as the rest of the world, this means that over 375k people are infected there against the stated 80k or so. This is more than 4x as many infections as they're stating, not unlike the revenues of a lot of their businesses. \n\nDon't fall for the clickbait, beer virus cancelled everyone back to work. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: SPY 3/27 $330 C", "created_utc": 1582818770, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fae2j4/actual_dd_beer_virus_is_fake_news/", "is_self": true}
