DD!!!!!!!!", "selftext": "# UPDATE:\n\nSeeking lolpha lied about the date of this article being from today, it's old, my bad. I figured that site getting news early was a red flag.\n\n\\------------------\n\n[https://www.sporttechie.com/nfl-partnership-2k-new-football-video-games](https://www.sporttechie.com/nfl-partnership-2k-new-football-video-games)\n\n>The NFL has announced a partnership with Take-Two Interactive brand 2K to produce multiple future video games in what will mark a return of football-themed games to the 2K brand. The deal revives a previous partnership that has been inactive since 2004 and promises non-simulation football game experiences that will begin launching in 2021.\n\nTTWO end of day at 4:30pm will skyrocket.\n\nEven modest gamers that aren't sports fans knows about the EA NFL deal, which took **NFL competition away and only allowed EA to make NFL games with brands** (otherwise you had to make up your own teams like the Washington WSB lolcalls, vs. the Deported Chicago Bearingtons)\n\nNBA however, did not let EA grab the exclusive license, and as a result **EA's NBA live lost marketshare overtime to 2k's NBA2k,and went on break for years, than coming back reformatted, flopped, and is now on absence again.**\n\nWith Madden bumbling many of the last 10 NFL games, including the 25th anniversary edition which was terrible an sold like crap, **it seems that the time of EA exclusivity has come to an end**. People will ***buy the new 2K NFL games in droves***, and unless EA spends more money and changes strategies, their Madden series will end up just like NBA live.\n\n**This also shows that the NFL has seen the sales numbers and performance of TTWO games compared to EA,** to want to break off the deal. Not only do 2K games, especially sports games, sell well, ***but in game purchases are often much more than what you see from EA across all genres***\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n\nThis is a money making deal for TTWO and a bad nightmare for EA, buy your calls for TTWO, and your Puts for EA for maximum earnings.", "created_utc": 1589999102.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gngt86/emergency_buy_calls_on_ttwo_take_two_buy_puts_on/", "is_self": true}
