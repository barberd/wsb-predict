I'm not willing to wager more than 15k on this play.\n\n-High premium for the leap, with decent liquidity.\n\n-An actually decent company, blue chip or close to. No bankruptcy risk. \n\n-No weed or oil. \n\nI know this isn't yolo, but this sub is better than all the other investing subs. Or at least it used to be. Plus I've been banned from most other related subs for calling them faggots and whatnot over the years. \n\nRight now I'm thinking Disney, but I kind of hate Disney. \n\nSPY is possible but I'd need a similar fund with a lower price per share. \n\nTQQQ is in the cards but I've been burned before on leveraged ETFs by the decay. \n\nSo what do you think lads?\n\nI posted this in the daily thread but there is so much traffic now any actual discussion is nearly impossible as comments are lost in the churn.\n\nThoughts are appreciated bros.", "created_utc": 1583008817, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fbipw7/recommendations_for_buy_stock_and_sell_leap_call/", "is_self": true}
