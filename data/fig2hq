Yes we might not know what will happen 1 hour from now but put time into perspective. What did we know about the virus two weeks ago? Just about nothing. So there is not one single person here that can actually say what might happen come Monday and thats just the truth whether you want to hear it or not. And as for taking facts and leaving out context concerns...\n\nThe government has already said there is likely to be multiple stages in relief bills to come. Why would they go al in right from the start? We have never been in the situation in the past and have no idea how it might actually effect things like day to day life or the economy. They are going to implement more and more relief efforts as time goes on as it might be needed to help extend the funds we have as long as we can to find answers to this virus.\n\nAnd i know all you autist's out there will read one sentence and comment \"Share or Ban\" or My IQ level is worse than a 2 year old\" but the conclusion to all this is just share all the facts we have before trying to manipulate peoples decisions. Im scared as hell and if your not either your either lying or don't have any debt but thats human nature due to the fact that we just don't know what news might come out tomorrow. It's time to come together and do what we can as humans to make this the past as fast as possible.\n\nIf you want to remove this then well i just wasted 10 minutes of my life but i think this needed to be said after seeing the changes in the forum from day to day.\n\nEDIT: To those that need to see a position. Yes i have DIA 180p 3/20 contracts\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2a1bqutz4mm41.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=a85e34b45de561efec44bc124fb471f8fc004397\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1584179922.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fig2hq/take_a_second_to_take_in_the_situation_here/", "is_self": true}
