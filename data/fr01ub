But I'm not sold on the idea that everything that could ever possibly happen is already priced in, and here's why.\n\nThe outbreak in China [blew up in late January](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/china/). Italy [started going to hell around early March](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/italy/). Considering that the year is 2020 and airplanes and boats exist, we **knew** this was coming to the USA. In fact, [we knew it on January 21](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/p0121-novel-coronavirus-travel-case.html).\n\nWhy didn't Wall Street react sooner? Shouldn't they have seen the writing on the wall? Is the market's magic crystal ball only able predict two weeks into the future? Is it unable to browse r/coronavirus like the rest of us? Did JP's quants suddenly forget how exponential growth works?\n\nI get that the market will price in predictable events like massive unemployment numbers, a $2T stimulus package, and even taint-scorching QE. Any chimp with an RH account could have seen that shit coming.\n\nBut you have to remember that the market is made up of people, and many of these people are old, stupid, and don't spend 14 hours a day on the internet like we do. They are used to a world in which each week is roughly the same as the week before. They haven't been reading the horror stories from Italian nurses that we've all seen. They don't beat off to the rising numbers on www.infection2020.com like you sick fucks. Sure, they know it's bad, but they don't know it's **bad**. \n\nSome of you doorknob-sucking retards will say that even though the virus wasn't priced in before, **NOW IT'S REALLY PRICED IN**. How many more times can you kick that can down the road? When are you going to realize that the market is just thrashing around trying to make sense of this meth-fueled donkey show like everybody else in the world?\n\nHindsight has shown us the market didn't anticipate the spread of coronavirus in the US, so why are you so confident that the market has somehow accounted for a future that is far less predictable?\n\nTL;DR: Please Jesus don't let my 4/17 puts be fuk", "created_utc": 1585457085.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fr01ub/if_everything_is_already_priced_in_why_didnt_the/", "is_self": true}
