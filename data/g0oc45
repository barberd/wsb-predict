I received my first sanction letter which they send out forcing you to reschedule or get fined. After going through the call center Olympics of retardation which is the California Government system i got to the right person to who was able to reschedule my jury service. They rescheduled me for August 3rd, 2020. I asked why such a delay and she explained they weren\u2019t scheduling cases until this time.\n\nCalifornia does not believe it will be functioning until at least August. Play it as you will but, it made my bearish grinch heart swell 3x it\u2019s size.", "created_utc": 1586801517.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0oc45/los_angeles_county_govt_opening_forecast/", "is_self": true}
