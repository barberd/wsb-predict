They are currently in their second phase 3 trial and will disclose data from this second phase 3 trial mid 2019, if these results are positive they wel apply for an NDA by the end of 2019. I don\u2019t think they will have much trouble in passing their trials and getting FDA approval for 2 reasons:\n- Tramadol itself is a known and widely used product; The efficiency and side effects of Tramadol are already known.\n- IV Tramadol is already used off-label in Europe. in the European guidelines for pain management, IV Tramadol has been the standard for managing moderate to severe pain. (For pain moderate in severity, its effectiveness is equivalent to that of morphine)\nAvenue therapeutics has already entered into a stock purchase and merger agreement with Fortress inc. and InvaGen, this agreement is conditionally upon receiving FDA approval. InvaGen will buy out all remaining shares for $13.92/share (currently: $4.92/share). \nAvenue Therapeutics raised $30M additional capital in february, enough to complete their clinical trials and reach end of the year.\n\nAlso the management team/directors have already bought around $1M of the companies\u2019 stock since the beginning of this year.\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: I am long in Avenue Therapeutics", "created_utc": 1554932496, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bbrs95/biotech_dd_inside_atxi/", "is_self": true}
