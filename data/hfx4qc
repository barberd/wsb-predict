And the contracts are stupid cheap for broke assholes like me.\n\n5g is the next big shift in telcom and with it we're going to see billions of IoT devices in the world. All those wireless devices and their metric shitton of data are sent to a tower and that tower needs a physical connection to the rest of the world. This is where CTL comes in, in 2017 CTL acquired Level 3 communications which at the time was the 3rd largest fiber provider in the US. All that extra internet traffic isn't being sent over some shitty xfinity copper from 30 years ago. Fiber is whats going to those towers. While everyone fights over deploying the 5g equipment they all rely on that fiber connection to the rest of the internet. \n\nThat's just 5g which we know is taking over the industry. Laying fiber is fricking expensive but you can bet your sweet ass every piece of new construction is fiber ready. Look around your city, new construction is everywhere and there's about to be more after a bunch of shit just got burned down. Construction is one of the few things that hasn't been shut down the past 3 months. New houses, apartments, commercial buildings are all setup for fiber. Connecting old construction to fiber infrastructure is a slow process but it's also going on in the meantime.\n\nTheir residential gig internet package is $65 without promotions, xfinity is $84 and Verizon is $79 with promotions and contracts. They've been ignored because DSL is shit unless you live in BFE and your only connection to the outside world is the telephone pole outside your trailer. I think they've been slept on since making the acquisition and expanding fiber gig service.\n\nOld people still want a shitty ass landline and small businesses use their shitty DSL internet like crazy because its cheap and available anywhere with a telephone jack. It's safe to say if you use these shitty services in 2020 you're doing it for a reason and likely won't change so the decline in that part of the business has already happened. The customers that are left aren't leaving anytime soon. With their fiber expansion they're actually competitive with the cable companies, which hasn't been the case for the past 15 years. \n\nSince the Rona crash they're still down 34% when anything to do with the internet is hitting ATHs. People aren't exactly canceling their internet plans right now. They beat earnings last quarter and I expect the same this quarter. So when shit like DDOG is dying after q2 earnings because they can't turn a profit, companies that actually have cashflow will look juicy af.\n\nNumber things:\nToday's close 10.04\n200ema 11.56\n50ema 10.25\n52w high 15.3\n11B Market cap\nP/E 8.9 vs 16.99 industry avg\nForward P/E 7.5\nFCF 3.1B\nDebt/Eq 2.6\n9.9% dividend\n\nIf you're into magic crayon stuff\nhttps://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CTL&ty=c&p=d&b=1\n\nBottom of the channel on the 1d, close to 20 on the stochastic, cross on the weekly MACD, below every MA on the 1w and 1d charts.
