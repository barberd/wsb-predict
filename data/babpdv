Wait to catch the knife?  I have printed some serious cash off these poor Ethiopians \n\nSNAP- the time is now.  Feel the emotion. Forget analyzing what they did Friday.  The sentiment has been changing on a micro level for a while and I think this was a move to the macro.  It\u2019s a fucking buy boys.  I want to buy some monthlies and maybe longer our $15.5.  Depending on premiums.  Also probably some weeklies that I\u2019ll babysit cause I think this is gonna be a good week for snap.  \n\nCL- why does anyone care about century link?  Cause it dropped a lot 25-&gt;12 in a few months and it\u2019s not going anywhere.  Idk some old guy who purported to \u201ctrade options for a living\u201d told me his best tip would be September CL calls.  Right now I have 200 shares based off that.  \n\nThanks for reading losers.  It\u2019s Saturday night.  Get a life.
