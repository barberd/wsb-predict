He says he will do follow up analystics as well. \n\nIMO doesnt look great, but who thought it would?\n\nMethodology: \n\nWe called ~1000 restaurant and retail locations based on popularity (we used # of reviews on Yelp by category as a proxy) to assess full re-open rate (open for dine-in, in-person shopping etc.) \n\nWe conducted physical audits at ~300 locations across restaurants and retail locations in Dallas to assess compliance against state re-opening protocols \n\n\n1)Re-opening Rate: Only 36% of businesses chose to open on the opening weekend\n\n2) Aggregate Degree of Safety Protocol Compliance \u2013 By Locations: Overall \u2013 96% of businesses were non-compliant across all mandatory protocols and all locations. The extent of non-compliance is dramatic with ~1/3 of all locations being <50% compliant across mandatory protocols as established by the Governor\u2019s office.\n\n3)Aggregate Degree of Safety Protocol Compliance \u2013 By Protocols: On average, ~60% of mandatory protocols were followed and ~54% of all suggested protocols were followed. In aggregate \u2013 locations followed ~58% of all mandatory + suggested protocols. \n\n4)Individual Location Assessments: Overall \u2013 there is a wide discrepancy amongst individual level performance by location type. \n\n5) Comparative Benchmarking Assessments: We\u2019ve done very preliminary levels of comparative analysis, but early assessments show a pattern in the data of highly variable compliance within a parent franchise. \n\nTLDR: Mark Cuban says the openjng is mostly for show and majority of small businesses have no idea how to operate post-covid. \n\nNo current positions.\n[Edit: included methodology]", "created_utc": 1588892443.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gfhaas/mark_cuban_post_covid_texas_reopening_analytics_dd/", "is_self": true}
