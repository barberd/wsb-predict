The FED, after successfully digitizing the finances of every citizen through laws and mandates, aims to tokenize all remaining wealth and \"reset\" the financials records of every citizen (this practice would soon be followed by Africa, most European countries, and, for reasons I cannot disclose, Dave & Buster's). \n\nThe response, it's been said, was a direct reaction and last resort solution to correct the crippling waves of economic chaos following the 2031 Depression, even further than analysts were willing to admit. The solution became clear -- make cash illegal, mandate that a digital-only base account be opened in every citizen's name, and a baseline value of $250,000 be added on the day of creation.\n\n\"KUFRSRAEB POWELL WILL SPEAK IN 15 MINUTES. PLEASE ENJOY A CUP OF TESLAZON COFFEE WHILE YOU WAIT. GOOD MORNING. KUFRSRAEB PO-----\" slips across your screen; it seemed to only encourage you to stay in bed. You dose off, and in what feels like an instant, you awake to the sound of KUFRSRAEB, notorious for sounding like his father, Jerome. Politics are still nepotistic in the future, don't worry.\n\nHe says, \" So...from this moment forward, like, we are, \\*coughs\\*, resetting the balance sheet of like...life, you know? Anyways, everyone has 250,000 dollars now, totally level playing field, and all markets are now 50% owned in equal proportion by every citizen. Together, we will make America YOLO again. So buy that dip, or that house, or whatever the fuck you want, because no more debt! We are resetting the simulation, while trying out some new patches. There is a chance that this update will cause collapse within weeks, but we have a great Plan B! Fuck you\" \n\nA TESLAZON espresso delivery ad quickly replaces the broadcast, as you slowly turn and stare out your window.\n\nThe sun creeps higher into the sky. Birds, almost sensing your joy and confidence in this second chance, glide across the wind, mere feet from your window. And in one cohesive moment, all of these things made sense. Now, you knew, and you couldn't un-know. \n\nYou smile, and think, \"You know....MSFT is definitely gonna hit 200 EOW. I can feel it.\"", "created_utc": 1592456214.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hb7zej/the_year_is_2083/", "is_self": true}
