{"id": "bdw8gf", "title": "SBUX bull here: time to short", "selftext": "Let me begin by saying I\u2019m a Starbucks bull. It\u2019s my fourth largest holding in terms of stock. It\u2019s been a good year. But it\u2019s time to make a shit ton of money on the pullback. \n\nA few months back, in November, it blasted through its ATH around $64. It\u2019s been on a steady tear ever since, and for pretty good reason. After being held down by fears that the company has reached its peak and was done growing, it showed steady growth amidst tepid market conditions. But now it\u2019s sitting 17% above its previous ATH, with a couple of weeks until earnings. The question is: what possible results would warrant an additional jump on top of the massive streak it has been on? It\u2019s tough to see this stock breaking $80. \n\nSo what you\u2019ll see is risk averse investors and just opportunistic investors that recognize the steam is running out moving money to safer bets through earnings. That means we are going to see a drop going into ER (in fact, it has already begun). The key to this move was waiting for the stock to peak and show some resistance. It has done so. \n\nThe play: 5/3 $75 puts for $1.25. Sell before earnings with profit to avoid risk, or hold through earnings if you have the balls.", "created_utc": 1555433507, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bdw8gf/sbux_bull_here_time_to_short/", "is_self": true}
