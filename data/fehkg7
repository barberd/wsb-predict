I never posted here because I thought I was a normie and didn't want to come off condescending to all you autists. Turns out I was one of you all along.\n\nYesterday I put in a buy order for 10 RCL call option for $910 before market close thinking this was a good time to start building a long position for the eventual bounce, and average down if the stock price kept going down. I quickly realized I put in a buy order for 100 options instead of 10 totaling $9,100! I was in PDT restriction so I could not sell.\nI decided I was going to hold and pray for the stock price to bounce up the next day.\n \nI woke up this morning and saw the stock price was down almost 5% and accepted my fate of sinking with the ship. My mistake resulted in a $2000 unrealized loss. Fortunately, a few minutes after market opened, RCL stock price jumped up from -5% to +3% where I was able to sell my position for a $2700 gain. \n\n[screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/YD9a20l)\n\nStay safe out there.", "created_utc": 1583518475.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fehkg7/gain_i_accidently_bought_100_rcl_call_options/", "is_self": true}
