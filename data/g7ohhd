{"id": "g7ohhd", "title": "Snapchat Performance This Week", "selftext": "All I read from this sub this week was shit about SNAP and big surprise it fucking took off during earnings and has traded in the same range ever since. Surely it will tank this time.. said every autist on this sub. This post is to hash out the bullshit and decide a direction once and for all because I am sick of seeing comments on the daily about it. \n\nIf you haven't noticed so far, fundamentals don't mean dick. Any company that does moderately well in this current environment and can sing a good tune will get shot into outer space. Just look at SPCE. It has nothing to do with overall valuation and everything to do with safe places to store money.\n\nIn the old days this safe place would be bonds. However, with the current situation at hand the impetus is on moving money slowly back into securities. Fund managers are looking for companies that won't go tits up in the next 3 months and they are watching the numbers closely. So, when companies like SNAP don't completely bomb on their numbers they become the next Zoom and fly into orbit.\n\nSNAP is the bullseye right now and even though it is a shit company and shit app it will continue moon for no other reason than it beat *some* estimates last week, has a decent technology edge, and makes sense at this point in time. If you go against this you'll get your nuts in a vise and you'll have nobody to blame but yourself. \n\nThat being said, it's probably not a bad idea to hedge because Spiegel is a total twat. The time to short this dumpster fire will be soon, my brethren, but it is not now. \n\nTldr: SNAP 20c 5/1", "created_utc": 1587794057.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7ohhd/snapchat_performance_this_week/", "is_self": true}
