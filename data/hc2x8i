{"id": "hc2x8i", "title": "FOLD at ATH", "selftext": "So I have been following Amicus Therapeutics for quite a bit of time.  They operate in the rare disease space which is booming.  Their main product Galafold is set to be a blockbuster and worth $500M in annual revenue by the end of 2023.  \n\n  \nJohn Crowley is the CEO who has a personal mission to make this a success.   Harvard MBA, Notre Dame JD, Naval academy. Was a marketing executive, then had kids and both of them got Pompe disease, he moved to Princeton to be closer to doctors, got a job at BMS. While his kids were getting treatment, he realized there was not enough research in the space, so started a company for pompe that was acquired by Genzyme. In order for his kids to qualify for the study he had to leave. Joined Amicus in 2004 and became CEO a year later. Stepped down and contemplated running for senator in 2011 but instead completed active duty in Navy reserves and went back to CEO.  \n\nThey have an amazing patient advocacy platform, a research center partnership with UPenn and a strong leadership team.  \n\nI am absolutely bullish on FOLD and have shares and recently sold some 7/17 $14C.  However, I think the recent run up to an ATH is a bit bloated and they will settle somewhere around 13.15 resistance.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrent position: Shares and  7/17 $13p", "created_utc": 1592581230.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hc2x8i/fold_at_ath/", "is_self": true}
