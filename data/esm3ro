Just lost half of it today. Still barely understand options...\n\nI get concepts like ITM, OTM, etc. (the very very basics). Would love to know:\n\n1. how exactly you guys use the greeks in purchasing decisions. \n\n2. Also I'm scared as shit I'll get assigned... How likely is getting assigned? and if I do get assigned, how TF do I pay off margins?? i'm only 18 i don't want to owe a million dollars to a brokerage just yet.\n\n3. any resources (outside this sub) you guys use?\n\nThanks for all the help!", "created_utc": 1579744200, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/esm3ro/i_need_advice_from_the_best/", "is_self": true}
