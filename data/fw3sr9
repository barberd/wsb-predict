We've hit the previous top and as of 2PM ET, rounding out. There is also a fib there, but because I'll be called gay, I'm going to stop. \n\n https://imgur.com/KZEw1Pl \n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. Volume today is incredibly low. Yes, the day is not over yet as of this screengrab, but based on the momentum right now, we'll probably end the day with 110 million shares traded. This is compared to 135 million Friday and 177 million Thursday. \n\n https://imgur.com/CUUHUgv \n\n3. VIX is still elevated, and has been trending up since this morning (wasn't perfectly inversing equity markets). People continue to buy protection, and we're still going to see 3-5% daily swings. (Don't mind the bad ticks on /VX futures). \n\n https://imgur.com/QuDocTM \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck. I was going to start shorting again at SPY 278. But being autistic, I went short gold this morning and getting killed for it.", "created_utc": 1586196801.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fw3sr9/some_food_for_you/", "is_self": true}
