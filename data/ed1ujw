Dec 27 with a strike price 3% below spot are selling for $0.13. Spot price puts are basically 10x more expensive than puts with a strike 3% below spot.\n\nDuring a period with higher volatility (eg: Dec 2018, Sept 2008), is the cost difference comparable, or is it significantly less? Would a period with high volatility likely have less of a difference for the above options (3x or 5x instead of 10x)? \n\nForgive me if this is common knowledge. I wasn't able to find any data to compare volatility and historic cost of contracts.", "created_utc": 1576800109, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ed1ujw/question_regarding_relationship_between_cost_of/", "is_self": true}
