Merill Lynch had an 18 month target price of $3K/oz, now the MSM is saying that it is going to hit $10K/oz in the next decade...**\n\nAutists: \"WTF GOLD, ISN'T THAT SHIT FOR BOOMERS?!?!\"\n\nBoomers: \"Yes, but hey, tendies are tendies.\"\n\nAutists: \"I DON'T WANT TO HIDE THAT UNDER MY BED, I AIN'T GOT SPACE! THAT'S WHERE I KEEP MY CRUSTY SOCKS!\"\n\nBoomers: \"Let me introduce you to goldminer stocks.\"\n\n# Yamana Gold ($AUY)\n\nTo summarize: *\"Yamana Gold, Inc., also called Yamana Gold, is a Canadian-based company, which engages in the production of gold, silver and copper.\"*\n\nYamana has solid fundamentals, especially considering the latest headlines: [Yamana Gold Announces Agreement to Sell the Chapada Mine for Total Consideration Over $1.0 Billion, Delivering Significant Improvements to the Balance Sheet and Shareholder Returns](https://www.yamana.com/English/investors/news/news-details/2019/Yamana-Gold-Announces-Agreement-to-Sell-the-Chapada-Mine-for-Total-Consideration-Over-10-Billion-Delivering-Significant-Improvements-to-the-Balance-Sheet-and-Shareholder-Returns/default.aspx)\n\nWhat makes Yamana a perfect stock to trade is the current uncertainty and volatility amid the markets. The U.S.-China trade tensions are the geopolitical hotbed that can push markets into crazy territory, according to analysts, who see June as a very turbulent month for the gold market. Gold prices are likely looking at more gains next week as markets worry about where the U.S.-China trade spat is heading. This market volatility is going to make the overall gold sector extremely lucrative for options trading in the months of June and July.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that Yamana is diversified into both gold and silver is a double whammy. Both gold and silver had an outstanding performance this past month. Now some people see the price action for silver to be a negative for gold... if anything, it makes the bullish case for gold more valid. Precious metals are only in an upward trajectory, and the market is additionally about to embrace the socio-economic uncertainty on a national level.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The current state of our economy:**\n\n*JPOW:*\n\nThe Federal Reserve has crossed a lot of red lines that have never been crossed before, and JPOW is not concerned... he's not worried about the consequences, adverse consequences, AKA INFLATION. He says, \"this is the situation that you just have to do it, and then figure it out afterwards\". AKA act blindly, hope for the best, and then see what happens. His philosophy at the moment: \"We'll just print the money and see where it goes, things are so bad that we might as well just do this because we're gonna collapse anyways\".\n\n*The Legislators:*\n\nDonny Pump: \"Nancy Pelosi can sit on my middle finger, I already cut this crackhead whore a phat check once. Wait until next month for your allowance bitch\".\n\nNancy Pelosi: Pushing any bill through the house that has the words 'free money for the proletariat' in it. Apparently we gotta pass the bill to see what's in it, we can't read the bill first, see what's in it, and then decide whether we like it and vote on it. NO NO NO... that takes too long, we just got to pass it, and then find out after the fact what we voted for. AKA typical socialist Democratic solutions; result is inflation.\n\n**Conclusion: JPOW + Legislators = Inflation**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Solution: Gold**\n\nHigh school economics: gold is a deflationary asset. Simply, because there is a finite quantity of gold in the world and it is highly desirable because of its intrinsic value, it is perfectly poised to appreciate; thus, it is an excellent store of value, and a perfect hedge to inflation.\n\nYamana can yield you autists tons of tendies this summer. Buy calls as they are still dirt cheap, the delta to theta ratios are really nice on this play.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nSomebody who's got a terminal disease is the best way to describe what America is doing with their monetary policy: \"just I'll take anything, I don't care, even if this stuff is gonna kill me I'm going to die anyway... what's the big deal?\"\n\nNobody's gonna cure the terminal illness for you, but you can either die a rich man (by printing gold tendies) or die a poor man (with worthless cash in your piggy bank)\n\n***AUY 10/17 $7 call***", "created_utc": 1590855892.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gtgwlq/why_goldmines_are_literally_goldmines_auy/", "is_self": true}
