I also do a lot of value investing and a little bit of swing trading. She wanted to learn, but felt my strategy was \"too slow\", because her friends were day/swing trading trends on social media and gaining thousands of dollars at a time. Here's where the lesson comes in;\n\nI was investing for one our her relatives, and she decided to take over the account (with the relatives blessing). But the money was too slow there (M1), so she sold everything and moved it to a platform that she could day trade in (RH). Each day over the past few weeks she'd gain 1%-4%. She'd call me, tell me all about her gains and how excited she was to be beating me. Last week I looked over the account and coached her on a few things;\n\n1) She had way too many stocks. She was holding 20+. For a beginner that's insane, especially on a platform like RH. \n\n2) She was holding onto her losses for ages because she didn't have a clear plan on when to let go. She'd see the losses but think they'd have to go up. It's what stonks do. \n\n3) No DD at all. Zero. Following her friends, who follow Twitter. YOLO'd the shit out of it. \n\n4) When talking to her friends, they never discussed losses. Only gains. Just like in life, you learn a lot more from your losses than your gain. \n\nShe thanked me for caring but decided not to heed my advice. Today it finally fell apart. She lost all of her gains over the last 2 months and is back at square one, pissed off and considering quitting all together. \n\nThe 2 biggest lessons for you newer traders out there;\n\n1) When you see the new hot stock on any social media platform. Do your own DD. There are tons of people who get paid to talk about stocks so that they can artificially pump and dump them. \n\n2) Strategize your exit plan ahead of time. Know how much you want to gain, and how much you're willing to lose. To get those numbers, you gotta do your own DD. \n\nOne last tip. Never put emotion into your stock. The more emotional you put in a stock, the more you're going to lose in the end.", "created_utc": 1590616767.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/grtc3e/lessons_from_my_sister_for_the_beginner_stonks/", "is_self": true}
