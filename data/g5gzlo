Mid May puts will print heavy. So like I said, if you missed the first train down the 220, or the giant green J POW dildo recovery, now is your 3rd chance to recover the money you told your wife you were \"investing\".\n\nSo if you fuckers can't read, I'll spell it out for you: S P Y  M A Y 15th  $200 P U T S\n\nIf I am wrong then I take it the Fed printed another trillion dollars and spy went to 320.
