{"id": "dmxdgj", "title": "Morning Briefing (10/25/2019)", "selftext": "# Futures holding up\n\nU.S. equity futures have fared relatively well this morning despite the\u00a0discouraging quarterly results and guidance from\u00a0**Amazon** (**AMZN** 1680.00, -100.78, -5.7%). The S&amp;P 500 futures trade two points, or 0.1%, below fair value.\u00a0\n\nAmazon's earnings results came up short of expectations, and it guided down Q4 profit and revenue below consensus. On the positive side, Dow components **Intel** (**INTC** 54.43, +2.20, +4.2%), **Visa** (**V** 177.64, +1.48, +0.8%), and **Verizon** (**VZ** 61.25, +0.67, +1.1%) all beat earnings expectations.\n\nOther than earnings news, headlines about China's willingness to purchase more agricultural products and the EU leaning on the side of a Brexit extension have seemingly given investors some thinking to do on these prolonged situations. Neither has had much sway on the market today.\u00a0\n\nEconomic data will be sparse, with the final reading for the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment for October (Briefing.com consensus 95.8) due out at 10:00 a.m. ET.\u00a0\n\nU.S. Treasuries are little changed. The 2-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.77%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.1% to 97.68. WTI crude is down 0.2%, or $0.10, to $56.13/bbl.\u00a0\n\nIn U.S. Corporate news:\n\n* **Amazon**\u00a0(AMZN 1680.00, -100.78): -5.7% after missing earnings estimates and guiding down Q4 profit and revenue below consensus.\u00a0\n* **Intel**\u00a0(INTC 54.43, +2.20): +4.2% after beating top and bottom-line estimates and issuing upside guidance for Q4 and FY19.\u00a0\n* **Visa**\u00a0(V 177.64, +1.48): +0.8% after beating earnings estimates and raising its dividend 20%.\u00a0\n* **Verizon**\u00a0(VZ 61.25, +0.67): +1.1% after beating earnings expectations.\u00a0\n* **Anheuser-Busch InBev** (BUD 84.23, -7.37): -8.1% after missing top and bottom-line estimates.\u00a0\n* **V.F. Corp**\u00a0(VFC 81.10, -9.72): -10.7% after missing earnings estimates.\u00a0\n\nReviewing overnight developments:\n\n* Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region had a fairly quiet end to the week, with most posting modest gains.\u00a0Japan's Nikkei +0.2%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng -0.5%, China's Shanghai Composite +0.5%, India's Sensex +0.1%, South Korea's Kospi +0.1%, Australia's ASX All Ordinaries +0.6%.\n   * In economic data:\n      * South Korea's October Consumer Confidence 98.6 (expected 100.0; last 96.9)\n      * Singapore's Unemployment Rate 2.3% (last 2.2%); September Industrial Production +3.7% m/m (expected +0.1%; last -7.3%) and +0.1% yr/yr (expected -4.1%; last -6.4%)\n   * In news:\n      * Not surprisingly, China reportedly didn't like Vice President Pence's tough-minded talk in yesterday's speech, yet it isn't expected to cut off trade deal discussions.\n      * Reuters is reporting that China wants the U.S. to cancel the tariff hike set to go into effect December 15 and remove the tariff imposed on September 15 in exchange for boosting its purchases of U.S. agricultural products.\n      * Bank of Japan policy decision looms next week.\n* Major European indices are mixed without a lot of notable movement on either side of the unchanged line.\u00a0STOXX Europe 600: -0.3% Germany's DAX: -0.1% U.K.'s FTSE 100: -0.5% France's CAC 40: +0.1% Italy's FTSE MIB: -0.1% Spain's IBEX 35: +0.1%\n   * In economic data:\n      * Germany's November Gfk Consumer Climate Index 9.6 (expected 9.8; last 9.8); October Ifo Business Climate Index 94.6 (expected 94.5; last 94.6)\n      * France's September PPI +0.1% m/m (expected +0.3%; last 0.0%)\n      * Spain's September PPI -3.3% yr/yr (last -2.5%)\n   * In news:\n      * Market participants are digesting more earnings news and seemingly have some indigestion over the ongoing Brexit saga. The EU has reportedly concurred that an extension should be granted, but it has not reached a decision on how long an extension should last.\n      * Parliament is set to vote Monday on whether to hold a general election on Dec. 12, per Prime Minister Johnson's proposal to hold one then in exchange for allowing lawmakers more time to consider the Withdrawal Agreement.\n      * Germany's Ifo Business Climate Index for October was unchanged from September, suggesting there could be some needed stabilization emerging in the business climate in Germany.\n\n**U.S. equity futures:**\n\n* S&amp;P 500 Futures +1 @ 3005\n* DJIA Futures -21\u00a0 @ 26757\n* Nasdaq Futures +6 @ 7935\n\n**Overseas:**  \n\n\n* Europe: DAX -0.1%, FTSE -0.5%, CAC +0.1%\n* Asia: Nikkei +0.2%, Hang Seng -0.5%, Shanghai +0.5%\n\n**Commodities:**\u00a0\n\n* Crude Oil -0.10 @ 56.13\n* Nat Gas -0.013 @ 2.303\n* Gold +6.30 @ 1511.10\n* Silver +0.346 @ 18.150\n* Copper +0.001 @ 2.669\n\n**U.S. Summary:**\n\n* **Earnings/Guidance (Full Earnings Calendar)**:\n   * Aflac (**AFL**) beats by $0.09, reports revs in-line; guides FY19 EPS above consensus\u00a0\u00a0\n   * Alaska Air (**ALK**) beats by $0.11, reports revs in-line; sees Q4 unit revenue +1-4%, capacity +3.8%, unit cost ex-fuel +0.5%\u00a0\u00a0\n   * Albemarle (**ALB**) reports prelim Q3 results, lowers FY19 guidance, and provides initial 2020 outlook\u00a0\u00a0\n   * Allegiant Travel (**ALGT**) beats by $0.49, beats on revs; guides FY19 EPS above consensus\u00a0\u00a0\n   * Amazon (**AMZN**) misses by $0.26, beats operating income and revs; guides Q4 profit and rev below consensus\u00a0\u00a0\n   * AmBev (**ABEV**) reports Q3 results and provides outlook\u00a0\u00a0\n   * Anheuser-Busch InBev (**BUD**) misses by $0.04, misses on revs\u00a0\u00a0\n   * Aon (**AON**) beats by $0.02, misses on revs\u00a0\u00a0\n   * Arthur J.
