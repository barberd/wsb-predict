I held it for a for a few hours and realized i have invested way to much than i have expected (cause i didn\u2019t know options sell in 100s lol.) After opening my brokerage account, this mistake has become a lucky accident. I accidentally made $1.6k in a single trading day. Of course i was more than happy to become part of the wtb rtards but my brokerage account has taken around $100 in commissions. Is there a commission free app like robinhood for someone like me who doesn\u2019t have a SSN?", "created_utc": 1583610724, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ff0g0f/alternative_of_robinhood_for_nonus_citizens/", "is_self": true}
