{"id": "f6l9ui", "title": "WU FLU WHERE ARE YOU?", "selftext": "For the past month you autists have been crying that the bears are full of shit as the market keeps climbing even higher. Every single stock drop has been followed by almost immediate recovery. Apple (in their own special way)  [announces they're going to miss earnings](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/02/18/apple-warns-of-potential-hit-from-coronavirus-outbreak.html?&amp;qsearchterm=apple) and the stock maintains only 1% off its ATH. What's the logic behind this. Why has this been happening? The bull case: \n\n* STONKS ONLY GO UP\n* WU FLU ISN'T REAL\n* LIQUIDITY PUMP\n* OLD PEOPLE DYING = GOOD FOR ECONOMY? \n* GOOD EARNINGS QUARTER\n\nSo we're sitting on Tesla at 917, Amd At 59 (subae bless) and SPCE at 39. We're mooning boys. Remember, the WU FLU isn't real. Well, until it is. Remember these companies represent things. Products being sold and all that shit. Currently we're sitting on one of the biggest supply chain disruptions in this century.  The economic impact for this is going to be massive and cases haven't been contained in other parts of the world. But don't take my word for it:  \n [https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/02/the-global-economic-impact-of-the-coronavirus-outbreak/](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/02/the-global-economic-impact-of-the-coronavirus-outbreak/) \n\n [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/19/coronavirus-could-cost-global-economy-1tn-in-lost-output](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/19/coronavirus-could-cost-global-economy-1tn-in-lost-output) \n\n [https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3051072/coronavirus-crisis-drags-cracks-are-showing-global-supply-chains](https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3051072/coronavirus-crisis-drags-cracks-are-showing-global-supply-chains) \n\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbHRGQ\\_0ReI&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbHRGQ_0ReI&amp;feature=youtu.be) \n\n [https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-global-economic-risk-stock-market-china-24da74a5-c824-4c79-a8c7-220213d28824.html](https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-global-economic-risk-stock-market-china-24da74a5-c824-4c79-a8c7-220213d28824.html) \n\n [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-apple-suppliers-analysis-idUSKBN20C147](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-apple-suppliers-analysis-idUSKBN20C147) \n\nLet's say you believe coronavirus is going to impact the economy, send us into a recession or at least a correction. Why isn't it happening yet? One simple reason, you fucking tards. Every retail investor up to their cousin becky has been dumping their life savings into stocks. After all, the only direction they've seen the market go is up. Nothing wrong with that right? Well boys and girls, the market is like a game of hot potato, and institutional investors are following us for the ride so far, but when we hit the point of undeniable evidence that there is a problem, we're going to be left holding a big old pile of shit. When is that you ask? Q1 Earnings, in other words:  \n\n\nSPY Puts @ 315 exp 5/15\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell except for AMD.
