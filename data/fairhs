But also, it could be you too. \n\nI\u2019ve been watching Everi Holdings for a while now, they\u2019ve been seeing consistent growth through the past couple of quarters and have yielded consistent tendies for me. However, in the past week the dead drop the market took brought EVRI down with it. That means everything is at a discount, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s for good reason.\n\nThey have earnings coming up on Monday, and I fully expect them to beat expectations. They have for real past 3 quarters, and all the news I\u2019ve heard about them since has been positive. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/everi-evri-report-q4-earnings-141902814.html\n\nIs this post long enough to get you to all-in?\n\nTL;DR: 3/20 $15 calls are hovering around .05 and .10, 4/17 $15 calls are about .15 and their earnings will boost them much closer to that.", "created_utc": 1582836878, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fairhs/everi_holdings_evri_basically_free_calls/", "is_self": true}
