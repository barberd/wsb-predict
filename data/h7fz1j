In low, low Interest Rate environments there are VERY few ways for large Institutions to make decent returns, reliably, with large sums of money (trillions).\n\nSo they find countries like Turkey that have much higher Interest Rates - they borrow USDs at Home, at low Interest Rates, then use it to buy Turkish dollars, then use those to buy Turkish debt that pay much higher Interest Rates.\n\nNow they're effectively holding Turkish dollars (Lira) and a vested interest in Turkey doing well so they can pay their bond coupons.\n\nIf the Lira goes down against the USD, especially by a  certain amount - the trade no longer pencils out. B\n\nBasically we borrowed Trillions in the United States to buy Debt in MANY (not just Turkey) foreign and risky countries - Debt that we must sell, IMMEDIATELY, if the USD goes up at a decent clip. \n\nDebt that then becomes basically worthless as they exit their trillions of dollars of Carry Trades. An effect that is exacerbated as the Lira is sold and the USD is bought. \n\nDefaults on credit in Developed countries (US is not the only Carry Trade leader) and Debt in Emerging Markets. \n\n The whole system collapses under itself.\n\nBuy USD, Sell Emerging Markets and Financials", "created_utc": 1591945829.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h7fz1j/exported_risk_and_this_shit/", "is_self": true}
