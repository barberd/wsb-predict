{"id": "ffpvfr", "title": "How Dustin Hoffman fucked me out of mad tendies", "selftext": "It was a brisk mid-Feb when I heard about the Coronavirus. Markets were at an all time high and I was loving my AMD gains. But after watching a weird prepper video on youtube about a guy who was convinced Coronavirus would rape the world, I felt a little scared and knew deep within it was time for me to go bear.  To that end I setup an order to buy $40,000 worth of XSP (\"real men SPY\") and proceeded to make the trade. They were April 17th dated puts with strikes at $300, $290, $270, and $235.  I also had some March 20th as well. Something inside me told me to do this after watching the prepper video on youtube.  But then later that night I watched Outbreak and it kind of made me second guess my thesis. Dustin Hoffman was able to find the host monkey and synthesize the serum to cure the town in like 30 minutes after a few flights around California on this little helicopter.  The next day I sold all my puts and the market maker spread took me down to about $37,000 for a $3,000 loss.  True story.  I wonder what would have happened if I had kept the puts until now.  At least I can go long on oil and ride the wave back up.", "created_utc": 1583731600, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffpvfr/how_dustin_hoffman_fucked_me_out_of_mad_tendies/", "is_self": true}
