{"id": "f8ulif", "title": "An Apology for my Midas Shit Touch", "selftext": "I joined this sub a few months ago after seeing YouTube videos of the big gainz and big losses, as I myself love the adrenaline rush of a good gamble. However, as per anything in my life, whether it\u2019s relationships, feelings, or gambling, every thing I seem to enjoy promptly turns to shit. \n\nI tried my hardest, staying in the shadows lurking, enjoying the loss porn and dreaming of golden ten died touched by Midas. But no, 2 months after I join, they came. Hordes of bots, greedy mid class people looking to ruin the option market in hopes of finally doing their first line of snow. \n\nI\u2019m sorry that I\u2019ve been cursed with hands that turn all into a shitpile. I will now use it for good, and turn you all to the bear market. Short GILD, their drugs won\u2019t work, but the coke in that hooker ass certainly will.", "created_utc": 1582565066, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f8ulif/an_apology_for_my_midas_shit_touch/", "is_self": true}
