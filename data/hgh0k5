Despite AZN stock down today the calls gained 40% literally, due to lemmings jumping in all day at the ask.\n\nWhy am I telling you now? Well AZN will likely get up above this by fall when their vaccine gets bought (whether it works or not is not our concern). They also have major earnings catalysts for their quarterly call July 31st, google Tagrisso their cancer drug.\n\nSo sell these retards who are spiking IV the Aug $65c  and buy yourself Sept/Oct $65c to form a good old fashioned calendar spread, .20 per option for you and max profit is almost $300. A solid 15-banger. Not financial advice do your own DD etc.\n\nTL;DR\nAZN  \nShort Aug $65c  \nlong Sept/Oct $65c  \n15 banger when it hits  \nEven the poors can participate\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/lvCGkqk", "created_utc": 1593208666.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hgh0k5/azn_calls_getting_pumped_iv_inflation_and/", "is_self": true}
