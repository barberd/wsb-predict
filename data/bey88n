{"id": "bey88n", "title": "Workaround to PDT", "selftext": "Saw that if less than 6% of your trades are day trades you don\u2019t qualify for PDT. Was thinking you could create a very cheap stock/etf where the price would be extremely low and stable, the company holdings would basically be a savings account with $100 in it. You could then buy a single share of this company multiple times a day and hold it for a few days then sell. This would increase your total number of transactions and you wouldn\u2019t qualify for PDT. RH is no commissions so you wouldn\u2019t lose anything there. \n\nAlso, too lazy to see if 6% is on number of trades or cash value of trades. \n\nDisplay my autist errors. Where does this plan fall apart. \n\nIs it Monday yet?", "created_utc": 1555674738, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bey88n/workaround_to_pdt/", "is_self": true}
