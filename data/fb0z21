Presently, all eyes are on Gilead and Moderna for their Remdesivir and  mRNA-1273 respectively, both of which are ready for human testing. Reports for Remdesivir on 1000 patients will be disclosed at an unannounced date while mRNA-1273 sent to NIAID will be tested in April and results by July. Whether the drugs are successful or not, there are not going to administer the drugs at large scale until later in the year, which leaves room for the virus to expand it's reach, potentially mutate, etc. A lot can go wrong, and for that reason, people will not be inclined to go out of their way to purchase at Starbucks in China. Being that this is an airborne disease, there are significant risks of going out to get that daily dose of caffeine in exchange for funeral processions.\n\n**DIS Puts** \\- Closing of parks with hurt revenue significantly, populated areas as such will not see much traffic for a while, changing of CEO at a time like this is a terrible move for press/confidence of investors, Disney Plus is a fad that is over. \n\n**NVDA Puts** \\- Over-extended prior to drop, losing market share, and will likely see some delays from TSMC. \n\n**GILD Calls** \\- I think this is a fairly obvious play. Any positive news and this can take off to triple digits! Remind me in 90 days! I wouldn't go for Moderna as I feel is is a bit extended.
