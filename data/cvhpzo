{"id": "cvhpzo", "title": "Late Fall Fantasy Football Calls", "selftext": "DD: use your friends fantasy football money for SPY puts\n\nLet's say I'm the owner of a 10 team fantasy football league with a modest $100 buy in. This leauge is literally just sitting on $1000 for 4 months, why not throw it into some SPY puts? I have the group convinced that investing is a good idea long term, but now I need to convince them I know where the market will be when the NFL regular season is over in early January. I'm what some communities refer to as a bear, but not all in the group are of the same mind. Some are not stock savvy in the slightest, and for whatever reason, they want you autists' opinions. I told them you'd just blow it all on TSLA calls, but there's gotta be another argentina somewhere waiting to collapse. So I ask, what do we do with our fantasy football money? I'd be okay with straight SPY puts and brace for a no deal brexit/mango v china rounds 12-31, but it's a long term play that might better be suited for a stock that has the potential to fall off the face of the earth. I know you autists don't hold anything for more than a day or two, but give me your best guess, what are the moves for this NFL season?", "created_utc": 1566784860, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cvhpzo/late_fall_fantasy_football_calls/", "is_self": true}
