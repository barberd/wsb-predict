If the markets are okay, they still wither and slowly bleed... But if the broader market corrects , they will bleed out faster than a hillbilly with his wife-punching arm stuck in a woodchipper. To me this sounds like a plan that literally can't go tits up. \n\nAny suggestions/picks on rotten companies that don't already have a crazy amount of short interest or are at risk of a squeeze?
