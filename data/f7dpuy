{"id": "f7dpuy", "title": "$MO &amp; $PEP (Good DD Inside)", "selftext": "Here's the deal - WSB is no longer on r/all, however the influx has already happened and there are nearly a million people in here all reading the same thing:  \n\n\n**BUY THE DIP**  \n\n\nNow, I'm new here from r/all and I don't really know WHAT dip everybody is talking about, but I did some DD for the other normie shits and wanted to share what I've gained:  \n\n\n$MO - Altria.  They are in the tobacco business and own \\[Copenhagen Smokeless Tobacco\\]([https://gtc.freshcope.com/copenhagen/security/login](https://gtc.freshcope.com/copenhagen/security/login)), which is the biggest smokeless tobacco company in the world.    \n\n\nGood play, if this is the dip we're all supposed to be buying, but I wasn't 100% certain so I dug a little deeper:  \n\n\nThe best dips available are Heluvagood and Dean Foods.  Heluva is owned by HP Hood, a private company.  No tendies there.  And Dean Foods is a pink, and I don't want to get banned for discussing penny stocks (plus they sold their dairy business to DFA yesterday, so probably dead in the water).  So I went to who I think is likely the biggest dip company:  \n\n\n$PEP - Pepsi.  Since Pepsi purchased Frito-Lays back when your grandfather was dodging the draft, they hold about 40% of the snack market - this includes Lays dips.  There is a caveat here - the dip kind of sucks, but since we're told **Buy The Dip** and since they are the biggest seller for some reason... I'm a big $PEP guy today.  \n\n\nThere you have it - this is the best DD I could put together with the limited information I have, since literally everybody today is saying **Buy The Dip,** which kind of makes for a fun party.", "created_utc": 1582303176, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7dpuy/mo_pep_good_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
