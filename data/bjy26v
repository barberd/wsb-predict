Where's FCAU going?", "selftext": "Fiat-Chrysler is struggling.\n\nPresently: They posted declining YoY April sales as part of a declining Q1 and they completed the sale of their parts supplier Magneti Marelli for $6.5B, which was supposed to sell for $7B.\n\nLooking forward, they can't meet EU efficiency standards so they're paying Tesla an undisclosed (billion+) amount to pool their numbers, otherwise they can't sell in Europe.\n\nRecently: They lost their visionary leader and revised their guidance down. The stock plunged and is still within a dollar of it's 52 week low.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the other hand, FCA is at book value (last quarter book was $15.01 and they were at $15.05 earlier today) with decent free cash flow and a PE of 5.5 versus Honda 7.6, Toyota 10.4, and Ford 13.2.\n\nThey have growth potential: Jeep is a popular brand, they're decently positioned in the lucrative pickup truck market, and they have an ambitious electrification plan.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPersonally, I picked up shares and 9/20 15c on today's dip. I don't know if they'll go back to $22 but I'm pretty sure they're worth more than their $15 book value.\n\nWhat do you guys think?", "created_utc": 1556820216, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bjy26v/fiatchrysler_reports_friday_am_wheres_fcau_going/", "is_self": true}
