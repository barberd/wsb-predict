It's multiple opportunities and not understanding the different ones mean you will surely miss the only one you do understand. This has happened with many people already since they've not know the bull trap is an opportunity. Knowing about the bull trap I could say really early take profit on 18,000 Dow - bull to 25,000.\n\n>So here opportunity is lost by trading the opportunity you see (Down, down and down) and at the same time you do not see the well backed buy in around 19,000 and later chance to begin to accumulate sells in 24,000. Two opportunities missed by looking squarely at only one. This will happen a few times through the crash. There will always be another trade later.\n\n>Besides from the crash, after a big fall we'll then soon enter into the most volatile bull or range market in all of history. During this prices will move a lot and be much cheaper than they are now. Making money buying in this kind of market will be easy. After another drop we'll come to the real foot of a brand new bull market - shiny, new, at logical value - no one using 'jerome Powell memes' in their \"Investment analysis\".\n\n>When that is happening at the exact same time things are going to start to simmer down for the assets that have bubbled as a result of risk hedging or any link to current events. Stocks in certain industries, currencies, perhaps metals and other hedge assets. They'll have bubbled just as big as stocks crash - because wealth is never destroyed. It changed owners and places.\n\n>These bubbles have not even formed yet and the 'Once in a lifetime opportunity' to trade these bubbles that will be as big as the stock crash can be anticipated already and trade plan can be sketched out for them - if one market crashes the domino effect of huge opportunities for the next decade all come into play.\n\n>I think we're alive during a big inflection point in history. An opportunity or a curse, depending on how you deal with it. It means things are going to change. Not too many people like change. Involves too much thinking. Following and echoing social norms and patterns is easier - but if you will accept times can change, a world of opportunity is ahead.\n\n>Don't make it a once in a lifetime opportunity by firing all your guns too early and missing.\n\n[My friend](\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/u_2020sbear/comments/gc0j14/a_once_in_a_lifetime_opportunity_is_shortsighted/)\n\nTL;DR: time to get out of your long positions and into your short positions.", "created_utc": 1588402718.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gc247a/get_ready_for_the_largest_wealth_transfer/", "is_self": true}
