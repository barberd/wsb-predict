This is not \"official DD\" but my assessment after reading the prospectus:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Uber currently it operates in over 700+ cities, 6 out of 7 continents with a total of over 10 Billion trips since 2012. That's fucking insane. They are the industry leader by far. Lyft is their largest competitor which began operations in 2012, only 3 years behind Uber's 2009 beginnings, but it's an absolute dwarf comparatively. Who is legitimately going to compete with them? \n* They have multiple platforms that Lyft doesn't offer with plans to expand and diversify what they can offer as a company. Uber Eats is exceptionally better than any other food delivery service I have used in the past. It's also the most cost effective and easy to use. I don't know much about Uber Freight, but logistics will always be a requirement for physical goods. With a network already in 700+ cities their path is set to expand and possibly compete as one of the best logistics companies out there. \n* It's not going away in my opinion. Uber will not go insolvent in the next 10 years, I believe it will absolutely start turning a profit in a handful of years. Uber is only 10 years old, between being founded and their IPO, the growth has been insane. Of course they operated at such significant losses, almost every company does at accelerated growth rates.\n* Top line revenue from 2016 to 2017 was +106%, 2017 to 2018 was +43%. I understand that top-line revenue YoY isn't the strongest metric to look at, but it shows that the growth rate hasn't nearly hit the top yet. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not going to go deeper into it or defend my position if challenged, but I don't think this is a \"lol Lyft\" IPO. Uber has potential to become the Google equivalent of transportation services. If you have the cash and feel like you can stomach the potential losses I wouldn't call you and idiot for dipping in.", "created_utc": 1557478334, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bmvwmz/my_case_for_uber_boring_buy_hold_position/", "is_self": true}
