Yesterday Goldman released a news article with the caption \u201d stocks don't have to go down ever again \u201d or something like that. I am paraphrasing, of course. But really? Stocks don't have to go down, like ever?\n\nEven on immoral earnings, collapsing oil prices, lack of demand, lack of consumption, a strong dollar, no vaccine, dovish central banks that have resorted to most magnificent money printing we have ever seen?\n\nDon't forget, Europe is in the thralls of COVID and an ever-increasing probability of political and social unrest as unemployment leaps higher. Capitalism sure looks different. She just ain't the gal I used to know!\n\nAnyway, it's best not to fight or argue into the ether on why squiggly bearish technical lines don't work or why the market is not pricing in economic armageddon.\n\nIn this scenario, don't argue. Just trade. Sell the Gernamn DAX at 10848 buy back at 10100 ish.
