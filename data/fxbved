Disclaimer: These are my thoughts to cultivate discussion and that is all. I have been right, I've been wrong! As Fuzzy says, \"use your noodle\" and be the creator of your destiny. \n\nThis market action has sparked my curiosity. After the anticipated bounce, I have patiently been waiting for the next leg down. Today I present some TA. The story of the past few years has been that the S&P 500 performance has been significantly driven by the performance of the top weighted members of the index. Those are:\n\n* MSFT\n* AAPL\n* AMZN\n* FB\n\nI include some TA from them below just for you to peruse, as their performance will continue to be a key driver behind the performance of the broader market. \n\n**My take: Bear flag has been forming and this considerable rally appears to become more and more exhausted, when noting volume and momentum.** Counter to this take in TA lingo: a new trend is forming. For the Elliot Wave Enthusiasts out there, I think that the SPY is representing a solid A-B-C correction pattern, and we are currently on the B counter wave, and another drop representing wave C will commence in the coming few weeks. \n\nI am watching SPY puts expiring 6/30, and recommend averaging into these positions should a retest of 275-278 occur. \n\nI am not a huge fan of exclusive TA. Instead, I focus on watching the FI markets. Understanding lending markets is key to noticing the direction of where we are going. I will make a separate post with my elaborate thoughts on that later this week, but this post is in response to many PMs requesting a thread for thoughts. I will update this at least once per day for the foreseeable future. As always, discuss in the comments! The best way to find nirvana is through discussion and challenging opinions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[SPY Daily](https://preview.redd.it/5ygik3z2ymr41.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=2988516325ccc08bf9f1da00c7197db2f1e4e97d)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[MSFT Daily](https://preview.redd.it/v1m1yez3ymr41.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=111fd157901f30bf46d428519a5ffd5ad6f4a756)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[AAPL Daily](https://preview.redd.it/1ox4eq65ymr41.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=44c639c6614d83916f131854f5a653318e1252a6)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[AMZN Daily](https://preview.redd.it/gxtur196ymr41.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=660804ba95b8b5d32cfd49cb716db986272b6c35)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[FB Daily](https://preview.redd.it/5xd0gg27ymr41.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2932dabf44bca06c91eb7340603963f74a860ee)\n\n4/8 - 2:15PM\n\nMarket marginally rallying after a pretty exhausted plunge yesterday. Big tech names are showing same pattern, and will know soon if breakdown of bear flag occurs. Key point of focus will be around the 255-260 level on SPY to see if the current trend holds. Any breakdown of the wedge hints at a direction toward the retest of lows. Talks of additional stimulus and SBA loans are key headlines behind the market, as well as some epicenters approaching the plateau of the corona curve. What I'm watching: We may see a retest of 275, or a push toward the 50% fib line around 278 by EOD/overnight. Retest is possible, but I expect a potential breakdown to retouch the trend line around 255-260. **This is just short-term speculation for long-dated entry point on puts.** The thesis is SPY retest of lows, and I find more comfort with longer expiries (hence June 30th). Use any retest of 275/push toward 278 as an opportunity to add. Use sound risk management. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[SPY Hourly](https://preview.redd.it/mbso9wzezmr41.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=807c961f8b2199944f7aace7124c6df6e73ffe21)", "created_utc": 1586370524.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxbved/drawings_doodles_and_useless_ta_what_im_watching/", "is_self": true}
