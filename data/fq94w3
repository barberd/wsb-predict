{"id": "fq94w3", "title": "What WSB is missing...", "selftext": "I'm reposting a longish post I wrote in response to a thread called \"What are we missing?\" It's a weird quirk of human nature that people ask things like \"what are we missing,\" and when someone steps up and tells them things they could be missing, they say \"no ur wrong, I'm right.\"\n\nFirst let me take this opportunity to post a pic I've been trying to post a week now but never gets approved. This is a warning against hivemind thinking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[WSB Then vs. WSB Now...](https://preview.redd.it/qpwm00gl0bp41.png?width=1797&format=png&auto=webp&s=37382dc57fc6767a8313b6a9d0b7bd14cd00504d)\n\nSo, what are we missing? Why isn't the market tanking? Here are some points to consider...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst of all, the market is already down 30%+. It's not like NOTHING has changed. The market tanked faster than it has ever tanked in history. Keep that in mind.\n\nCorona virus created hysteria. And yes, that's what it is, hysteria. It has killed a whopping 27,000 world wide.\n\nJust imagine you woke up from a coma, and the whole world was panicking over a virus, and you asked how many were dead, and they told you 27,000 (SO FAR!!!). You would think the world had gone insane.\n\nAll you have are models and predictions and estimates of what COULD happen. But most likely those models and predictions you are buying are all wrong. It's not as serious as you WANT IT TO BE.\n\nUnemployment has skyrocketed, yes. But that is TEMPORARY unemployment due to a TEMPORARY lockdown. Once businesses open up the unemployment stats will tank overnight. Of course some businesses will close permanently. I'm not saying it's all sunshine and roses here. The point is it's not as bad as everyone WANTS it to be.\n\nAnd yes, printing money just fucking works. The Fed can print and print and print and nothing is stopping them except hyperinflation, which we are nowhere near yet. You can prop up any company, any market, with trillions in QE and bailouts.\n\n**TL;DR- You are not being objective here. You think you are, but you aren't. You want the economy to tank, you want corona to be worse than it is, you want your puts to print. Wanting it to be true doesn't make it true.**\n\nWe are gonna be fine, everything will be back to normal in a couple months.\n\nAnd all the people who were wrong about MILLIONS OF DEATHS will find their excuses. \"Being hysterical was the RIGHT thing to do. It was the SMART assessment given our (wrong) data at the time. Don't blame ME for the data being wrong!\" etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit for current positions: Sold SPY LONG yesterday at 258 with 225 cost basis. Holding 225p 4/17.
