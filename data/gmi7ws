{"id": "gmi7ws", "title": "TCO Acquisition by SPG", "selftext": "On Feb 9, Simon Property Group offered to acquire Taubman Centers for $52.50 a share, making the price jump from $34 to $53. It stayed there until mid-March, when the price started bouncing between $35 to $45. During the earnings call last week, the CEO of SPG refused to comment in any way about the progress of the acquisition or to even say why he wouldn't comment, despite being asked several times in different ways.\n\nInitially I assumed that a reduction in price was being negotiated due to the coronavirus shutdown. They are both retail REITs, and SPG has declined from $142 to $57 since it started. However, I've been digging into their Merger Agreement and I do not see how SPG can legally terminate their acquisition.\n\n8-K report generally describing the acquisition: \nhttps://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1022344/000110465920015273/tm206965-1_8k.htm\n\nText of the Merger Agreement: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1022344/000110465920015273/tm206965d1_ex2-1.htm\n\nSpecifically, section 8, Termination, does not allow SPG the option of unilaterally breaking the agreement unless there is a breach by TCO or a \"Material Adverse Effect\". But that is specifically defined on page 80 to exclude pandemics.\n\nUnless there is a catch I haven't found, why isn't TCO $40 calls free money as long as they expire after this agreement is closed? Any lawyers care to comment?\n\nPositions: Long SPG $60/65 6/19 bull spreads", "created_utc": 1589865005.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gmi7ws/tco_acquisition_by_spg/", "is_self": true}
