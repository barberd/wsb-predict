China was lying about their economic standstill, Trump said it was spring allergies with some indigestion and I went from being down 90% all time to being down 99.9% all time. \n\nSo I did the unthinkable and took the advice of a gay bear on this sub. Not only was I short, I wasn\u2019t even short using my own logic and convictions. I became the stock equivalent of a gay glory hole bear. Whatever he stuck through that hole I slurped up without a question. Short airlines? Ok. Short cruise lines? Yep. Short travel sites? I\u2019ll take it all, sir. \n\nIt was gross (seriously I barely liked it at all) but you know something? It fucking worked. I think the dude made like $1.1M. I did not because I lacked the heart of a true gay bear. But at least I saw green last week. \n\nRegardless, it was wrong. I\u2019m ashamed and here to make up for it. \n\nTendies going to DIS 4/17 135 calls (positioned opened) COST and maybe Apple. \n\nI know you don\u2019t care about logic, but Disney had the triple wammie of a CEO change, closing Asian parks and the fear over cruises along with the broader market decline. But their drop was one of the bigger overreactions last week because it ignored the diversity of the company. Worst case scenario what are people going to do if they\u2019re stuck at home? Probably watch ESPN,  HULU and Disney+. And when corona clears up people will be back at the parks and buying whatever weird Star Wars merch they typically buy. Management expects a $175M loss from closing the park in China. That\u2019s it. Out of a company with $4 BILLION in operating income. 100 day moving average is $140 and DIS is trading at $117.  Recovery back to the two year trend line, which is not particularly bullish given the growth of the company and the launch of DIS+, is a home run. If you think $135 is ambitious the $130s are trading for $2.13 as of this writing. \n\nAnd COST. Come on. That\u2019s just easy. \n\nThis is truly free money. Unlike all the other times I thought it was free money, because that gay bear really knocked something loose in my head when he was going to town.", "created_utc": 1583160671, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fcd4mv/my_time_as_a_gay_bear_is_over_and_im_back_w_dis/", "is_self": true}
