You wanna stimulate the fuckin economy? Why not give the younger generations the hope of being able to buy a house in their lifetime. The total student debt in the US is currently 1.6 trillion. When it comes to stimulus, the number 2 trillion has been passed around more times than my wife has left me for being a loser and QE is going to infinite and beyond Buzz fuckin Lightyear style. If the federal reserve is going to continue buying up all the bad debt they please, why not add another 1.6 trillion on top of that? Maybe this post doesn't belong here, but why not try and stimulate somewhere (giggity) that will actually make an impact in the long term.\n\nPositions: 4/17 DIS 100p (fuck you mouse)", "created_utc": 1586487889.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fy6yax/stimulate_this_jpow/", "is_self": true}
