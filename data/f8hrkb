I'm currently long on it, after dipping in and out.\n\nI'm currently down 10k after being up 9k.\n\nFutures are not looking pretty, and given that SPY 1% made ROKU lose 5% I think I want to get out ASAP.\n\nAnother 5% ROKU falls would make me lose another 10k or so which I could eat, but I could cut my losses and see what happens next.\n\nIt looks to me like this is another End of Jan though with an over-reaction that will be followed by returning to trending upwards, though holding through it will mean potentially seeing a 20k loss on paper for a week which is uncomfortable, and if it was to tank even further it'd wipe out my trading account.\n\nThoughts? Would also be interested in your positions/plays.", "created_utc": 1582499775, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f8hrkb/exiting_roku_not_options/", "is_self": true}
