{"id": "elmnwe", "title": "VIX, VXX &amp; UVXY about to pop Jan 8", "selftext": "Hello autists,\n\nSee the 3 month print for $UVXY.\n\nAfter market close, over a dozen missiles were dropped on american bases in Iraq, or something like that. Details don't matter.\n\nWhat DOES matter is what will happen to VIX, VXX &amp; UVXY. UVXY closed at $12.73 today, but by 7:00pm CT UVXY is at $14.60; a 13.88% gain.\n\nLike any volatility ETN, they are mean reverting and have negative drag. So even if it pops to $15-$16 in the next couple days, that would be a good time to start either a) buying puts outright; b) buying put spreads if you're less autistic; c) if premium is high, sell \\~30 delta puts; or d) go full autistic and sell naked calls.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs of market close when UVXY was $12.73, the Feb 21 10 put was $0.48/0.54. A 16/18 call credit spread was \\~$0.25, not too much CR. Another interesting option would be if you don't feel UVXY would drop from the \\~15 now to $12ish in 45 days, sell the $12 put for $123/1.57.\n\nAs for a 60-90 day outlook, I then the smartest call would be selling \\~30-35 delta puts. Get assigned, that's fine for short term, especially with growing Iran-US tensions. On any major spike, the mean reversion is quite strong, buying OTM puts would be the best choice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThoughts? \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xpj145qfzg941.png?width=844&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d604aaf7e1c2ce407cbc71ea18d12c0696d463e", "created_utc": 1578452980, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/elmnwe/vix_vxx_uvxy_about_to_pop_jan_8/", "is_self": true}
