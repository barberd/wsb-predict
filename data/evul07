AMD has historically always crashed after a run-up of similar amount. Unless new architecture performance meets rumors, and is priced competitively &lt;- both extremely big challenges, we could see a significant pullback on AMD stock. Remember, AMD is always lagging in NVIDIA's top performing architecture, and there's no indication of that changing soon.\n\nhow large of a pullback can we expect?\n\nPrices will likely hold at current levels +/- 10-20% until actual news come out on the next gen architecture benchmarks, after that price might surge further to $80+ or crash back to $30-40 range.\n\nMy play strategy: sell covered calls until actual news is released", "created_utc": 1580337040, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/evul07/i_posted_on_amds_trajectory_3_months_ago_whats/", "is_self": true}
