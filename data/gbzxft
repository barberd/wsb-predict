They will not purchase treasuries at the next auctions and interest rates will spike. Chaos in the bonds market will lead to chaos in the stock market. Bears,go in for the kill. Bulls, close your long positions on the 11th and reopen them at noon on the 13th. What makes this play so beautiful is just how well it can be timed. $TLT ATM put 5/15 purchased 5/11.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*\\*\\*Automod didn't like the full post, I'm going to be editing this together in parts to figure out what word or phrase is triggering it, bare with me here\\*\\**\n\nThis post will start off with some ECON 101 shit for the autists who never learned the basics. If you already know why bond prices move in  the opposite direction as interest rates and why China buys so much US debt, then skip ahead. The bond market dwarfs the size of the stock market, there is about 9 times as much outstanding bond value as there is total market cap. Bonds are where the big boys play.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Interest rates and bond pricing\n\n**When interest rates rise, the prices of old bonds fall, and when interest rates fall, the prices of old bonds rise.**\n\nConsider a zero coupon bond, one where you pay a certain amount and at the end of the bond term you get paid back more (unless you\u2019re a cucked German bond buyer). For a one year bond with a 5% yield, you would pay$95.24 for the privilege of redeeming the bond for $100 in one year\\[Formula:(end value \u2013 price)/price = interest rate\\]. But what if the next day interest rates fall to 3%? The bond you just bought suddenly looks a lot more attractive. Its yielding a lot more than the bonds the suckas are buying today. If you turned around and sold it the next day, you could scalp off the extra yield and sell it as though it were 3% bond. Using the same formula, you could sell it for $97.04. Nice. If on the other hand, the interest rate rose to 7%then everyone trying to make a buck would want the bonds they buy to yield 7%. In order to sell your 5% bond, you would have to take a loss to make it attractive. The new price of the same bond would be $93.48.\n\n**The sensitivity of a bond\u2019s price to interest rates, depends on the bond\u2019s time to maturation.**\n\nThe more years a bond has to collect interest, the more the rates affect the bond\u2019s price. Consider a bond that pays 5% a year, compounded annually. In practice, only savings bonds compound, but any bond can be recalculated as if they compound. That bond would cost $231.38 and pay out$1000 at maturation \\[Formula: end value = price \\* interest rate \\^ years\\]. If the next day, interest rates increased to 7%, U R FUK. That bond would now sell for a paltry $131.37. If interest rates fell to 3%, your investment would nearly double to $411.99. If they fell to 1% you could sell that bond for$741.93. Damn WSBGod. That\u2019s the power of compound interest. Below in the DD section, there\u2019s a more realistic graph showing approximately how $TLT will respond to interest rate movements.\n\n**Interest rates depend upon supply and demand for a bond.**\n\nThe fundamental rule of microeconomics: prices are set by supply and demand. Therefore, the discount and interest payments of a bond depend crucially on what market participants want, their *demand*.  Suppose you know a company, Widgettech, that sells widgets is run by a  complete moron and that Widgettech is trying to raise capital by selling bonds. There\u2019s another company WidgetDotCom, run competently, that currently sells their zero coupon bonds with a 3% discount. Would you buy Widgettech bonds at 3%? Hell no. You need to receive a premium for that. The same is true for government bonds: th eUS 10 year is trading at 0.6% interest while the Brazilian 10 year is trading at 8% interest. Investors need to be compensated for the risk that Brazil can\u2019t pay them back. Demand for crappy bonds is low. Demand for good bonds is high\n\n*Supply* is another fundamental issue. If you want $100 to YOLO, you could probably get a loan from your dad. If you want to YOLO $10 million you\u2019re going to need to look elsewhere. The larger the loan you want, the more market participants you\u2019re going to need to engage. To get that  $10 million you\u2019re probably going to need to put your tin cup before a bunch of banks and all your friends and family. To make them pay any attention to you, you\u2019re going to need to make them a damn good offer. It can\u2019t be the \u201cI\u2019ll pay you back next week\u201d that you might do with your dad. It would have to be \u201cI\u2019ll pay you back an additional 50%.\u201d When a company or nation wants to take on substantially more debt, they will need to raise the interest rate to get more people to drop some change in the tin cup they\u2019re rattling.\n\n# US Treasury Bonds and China\n\n**Exports naturally lead to a strengthening of the exporter's currency, but China cockblocks the yuan.**\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1588391710.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gbzxft/the_bond_market_crash_begins_on_may_12th_and_13th/", "is_self": true}
