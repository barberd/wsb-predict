Politicians on both sides have touted it as program to save small businesses from going under.  Sounds awesome, they finally care about the little guys.  Well let me tell you why this is bullshit and what their true intentions were. \n\nThe PPP loan is based off employer payroll, which also includes benefits such as health insurance.  Basically, small businesses are getting 2.5x their average monthly payroll.   The loan will be forgiven if the borrower uses it for payroll during and retains their employees for a 10 week period.  There is also a provision that will allow up to 25% of that amount to be used for rent, mortgages, and utilities.  Businesses can use the loans for other expenses, but those amounts will be subject to repayment.  \n\nSo why is this bullshit?  The government has basically funded employer-sponsored unemployment.  Rather than overwhelm the state unemployment systems, the government is pushing 10 weeks of payroll to each business and forgiving the loan amount if it is used for eligible expenses.  A lot of small businesses will still go under because their non-payroll expenses are still not being covered adequately and addressed by the program.   \n\nSo why would the government design a program like this?  Pretty simple answer...to drive down the actual unemployment numbers.  There will be a surge in unemployment within 10 weeks as businesses exhaust their loan amounts.   Think about it, no credit check, no personal guarantees, no collateral, just shove money to businesses and forgive the loans if they keep paying their workers.\n\nI also believe the government underfunded the program from the start.  Why?  Simply to space out the impact that this will have on unemployment.  The next round of funding for the PPP will most likely come out next week.  \n\nTLDR:  Government is funding employer-sponsored unemployment.  Government intentionally underfunded the program so that a second round of funding will space out the unemployment surge.   \nMain street businesses and smaller businesses are screwed if they don't have adequate cash reserves (most don't), and the unemployment numbers are being underrepresented.  \n\nPostions:  SPY 300C 5/15, switching to puts in beginning of June.", "created_utc": 1587330700.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g4fjjw/sba_loans_and_sleight_of_hand_employersponsored/", "is_self": true}
