I accept that wide bidask in these wild days but half the time the whole fucking feed disappears and only 10 prices remain on the whole chain and the bidask is 3 dollars.\n\nIs anyone else seeing this? Is this a sign of broker in trouble? Am i retarded that there is an inmocemt explanation of this?", "created_utc": 1587551184.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5youv/interactive_brokers_clcrude_options_price_feed/", "is_self": true}
