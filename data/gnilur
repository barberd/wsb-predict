It also claimed to have exited 2019 with about $500 million in cash and to have cut down selling, general and administrative expenses by $130.4 million. \n\nCons:\n\nA) You can buy video games at so many places now - Target, Walmart, Best Buy, digital downloads from the publisher, etc.\n\nB)   Hestia Capital Partners LP and Permit Capital are activist investors and fighting to put their own board picks for the annual meeting schedule on 6/12/20.  GME has responded by sending out letters to their shareholders urging them to vote for their own picks.  Regardless uncertainty continues to be a pressure point for them going ahead.\n\nReminds me of the HOG (many autist bears like myself got smoked on that trade) activist shareholder battle which was ultimately resolved ahead of earnings.  I don't see GME resolving anything before earnings but it could do so before the June 12 meeting.  \n\n [http://www.RestoreGameStop.com/presentation](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=2809120-1&h=1273700596&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.restoregamestop.com%2Fpresentation&a=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.RestoreGameStop.com%2Fpresentation) \n\nC) All of their stores were closed\\*( see above) for March and April.  Some may have reopened in states that lift ed restrictions but foot traffic is probably low.\n\nD) Accounting officer resigned recently (claimed it was for personal reasons) but people are skeptical.\n\nE) IV is ridiculously high for options. even same week like this week options.  Maybe better to play this buying the stock outright and riding it much like bargain shoppers on r/Investing are buying Macy's stock.\n\nBUT the IV for LEAPS is more reasonable ( by GME standards) and there is actually some decent volume on them. See the Jan 21/5c's.  \n\nTLDR: Buy GME LEAP calls. The proxy fight and other uncertainties should be resolved by the next meeting but don't count on it.  Instead buy yourself some time by going all the way out even if u have to sacrifice to Theta gang.", "created_utc": 1590004616.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gnilur/gamestop_earnings_528/", "is_self": true}
