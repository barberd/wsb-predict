The Coronavirus scare has been chilling out in the past week, but it\u2019s still as much as a threat, if not more than it was last week.  It\u2019s gonna take 12-18 months to get a cure, it\u2019s expected to cut GE\u2019s EPS By 23%, and mess with a ton of other companies revenue.  My suggestion is to BUY $303 PUTS MARCH 6th or 9th.  Yesterday I predicted the AT&amp;T jump, making over a 200% profit in 1 day.", "created_utc": 1583416317, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fdvj35/short_the_sp_today/", "is_self": true}
