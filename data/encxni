{"id": "encxni", "title": "Reiterating $CRC DD", "selftext": "Throwing this up again after the oil slide this week, go ahead and inverse me\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What the fuck is CRC?**\n\nCalifornia Resources Corporation is the largest oil/gas producer in California. This bitch was spun off from OXY in 2014, and boy was it bad. They stripped them of their accounts receivables but left them with their accounts payables -&gt; debt basically fucked them for years and still does. As a result it's one of the highest beta stocks on the market (I believe **the**highest in the E&amp;P sector). Peak post spin debt of about $7bn and currently just under $5bn of debt with about $1.2-1.4bn of EBITDAX projected for this year. CRC is a traditional steamflood producer \\*\\*(emphasis, CRC does not utilize fracking),\\*\\*which in turns makes it's wells low declining (7-10% a year declines vs some of the 40%+ first year declines we see in shale plays).\n\n**What's the deal with it now?**\n\nYeah, looks bad. From a post spin peak of about $90 when oil was ripping back them to a low of nearly $3 a few months ago right before Q3 earnings. This is one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the market, with a short interest of \\~40% currently. The stock made a run up in 2018 all the way up to $50 to get shit on for all of 2019 down to where it is now. I've been long on the equity since $7 in 2017, and have been trading options in and out of it for the last year. Lot of fear mongering in the company and it's ability to repay debt, along with CA being batshit crazy legislative wise over oil.\n\n**The company itself and pros/cons**\n\nI saw this thing run up from $7 to $50, and I think it can do it again; and profiting on the volatility on the way isn't bad. This management team is stellar, Todd Stevens has one massive dick and has stated he's not afraid to play chicken with the shorts. They've been pretty much cash flow positive through this entire low cycle of oil (Sub $70 Brent, sub $65 for pretty much the whole part) and have worked towards paying back debt while similar shale companies are on the verge of blowing up since their well declines have been drastically understated and no one wants to lend to these mfs anymore.\n\nWSJ article on issues with Shale here:\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-shale-wells-age-gap-between-forecasts-and-performance-grows-11577631601](https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-shale-wells-age-gap-between-forecasts-and-performance-grows-11577631601)\n\ntwo big cons of CRC:\n\n* Massive Debt, main reasoning for the price decline  \n\n   * Huge debt wall in 2021/2022, which if you don't come up with a large source of cash or pay off enough to refi it's going to bury you.\n   * They've made strides to buying back their debt on the open market; I believe since the start of this year they've bought back about $250MM or so of their 2nd Liens at a 30% discount or something like that (feel free to correct me on their IR page), but it's not significant enough with how big the mountain is with small repurchases\n* Oil Pricing  \n\n   * It seems like most people in the space are chanting lower for longer. If Brent plummets under $60, we're gonna have a hard time paying back debt. At $60, it's not CHP11, but it's not great either. Long story short Brent staying around or even over $70 for the next year or two is going to help a lot with the debt reduction process. Note that CRC receives Buena Vista pricing, which trades currently at a \\~$3 premium to Brent.\n* CA Legislation  \n\n   * Yeah we're fuckin democrats and they hate oil and big money shit yada yada. Bills get proposed all the time, and they tank the stock. They never pass. AB345? and the recent fracking one are great examples. Shit tanked 30%+ just to recover the next day when that shit dies. CA is a **DRIVING STATE** and that won't change, not everyone is buying a TSLA just get (I know praise our god Elon). And it's oil dependent. No piplines. 70%+ of it's crude is imported. From where you ask? Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, etc. Oh do I need to mention those places are kinda in a sticky spot right now?\n* There's a lot of hit pieces on CRC you can find on SeekingAlpha; most of them will pretty much reiterate the same two points. Lots of debt, low oil prices, company is fucked.\n\n**Why I think it's a winner**\n\nAlright I'm getting kind of lazy, so I'm linking Seth Lowry, CFA's comments from SA here, I know it's on a fucking forum but this is probably the most insightful comment into CRC I've ever seen. Scroll down near the bottom of the comments, it's **really** long so you can't miss it:\n\nEdit: Can't post direct SA link so here's an imgur gallery of his comment. If you want to get the link to just read the discussion I'm happy to PM.\n\n[https://imgur.com/gallery/8MYsjUt](https://imgur.com/gallery/8MYsjUt)\n\nFor you fucks that are too lazy to read it, long story short:\n\nThe debt wall is definitely there, but it's still \\~2 years out. Management has time. And management has been calculated. Listen to any of their conference calls (if you're not fuckin lazy) and they have been reiterating the same message for the last 2 years, and been consistent on it. Instead of a silver bullet, a multi-pronged approach to delevering gives them the best shot:\n\n* ORRI - basically a royalty sale. CRC owns Elk Hills, which is a massive fucking field in Cali. If they sell $50MM a year of production, at a 16-20x multiple, that could be up to $1bn to use towards debt repayment. $RRC recently did a few ORRIs at 12-14x multiples, and those were gas, high (20%+) declines. We're talking oil, low, 7-10% declines.\n* Midstream Assets - CRC has $1bn+ worth of midstream assets they can still monetize, examples have already been done before ie with Ares, still viable.\n* Huntington Real Estate Sale - CRC owns \\~90ish acres of prime beach real estate in Cali. Why? I forget and I don't fucking care. Just know that there was a bid on it back in 2010 for $300mm. I work in REPE, and that shit is definitely worth a lot more now. Sam Zell just did a JV with CRC. **Yeah, the billionaire, real estate Sam Zell**. Wonder if need be he would have any interest in taking some of that?\n* Debt Repurchasing - Hell yeah these bonds trade at a fucking discount, and management knows it. They stated on the last call, why even bother chucking all our FCF at exploration right now? Our second liens trade at literal 75% discount, we have \\~$1bn of JV capital in hand to drill with, and buying our bonds gives us a straight 200%+ IRR right off the bat.  \n\n   * *Sidenote, the JVs are mostly done with clauses that allow the interests to revert back to CRC once a certain hurdle has been hit, 2 which were done with BSP partners and Macquarie are due to revert any day now, where CRC's interest in the cash flow reverts from \\~10-15% to the majority \\~80%. This should add $100MM+ to the topline when they do.*\n* The Macro Picture - Tension in the middle east, Iran today, dur. Mohamed Bone Saw briefly got his $2tn, but that doesn't mean jack shit unless he can IPO the rest internationally and secure his tendies. He's an autist just like us and is long hella OTM in $OIL. So bet your ass he's going to do anything and push any narrative he can to get Oil up.  \n\n   * U.S. shale production, which has been the biggest driver in oil supply in so many years looks like it's finally tapering off. These fucks can barely keep up at $65 brent, look at the frac spreads and how badly the rig count has dropped. And to anyone who says they can just ramp up production when they want if oil rips up, the fuck? You seen how much debt these guys owe? Makes CRC look like peanuts. I think it's $100BN+ over the next 5 years? With Tier 1 acreage running out? And totally restricted lending? If anything, the downfall of some of these other players will be a godsend to CRC. Investors (already have) will pull out shale, leaving only the big boys and will seek other, actual value investments. Look no further than $HAL and $SLB both taking $10BN+ impairments the last quarter in the NA divisions.\n\nSome people point out that the company could have issued new equity last year when the stock was near $50, that would have brought in some cash that could have been used to pay down debt; in hindsight they might point out it was stupid not to, but management has made it a point that they haven't had to issue much equity since the spin period. I think it's a testament to their situation. They're not as desperate as they seem and have a few options to pull from. Listen to the BAML transcript if you can from \\~2 months back. Todd mentioned a JV upcoming soon, potential real estate monetization \"within a few months\", and confirmed there has been a party they are in talks with about the ORRI. I will say the firms PR is pretty trash at keeping investors up to date with all that's going on, which is why there's still a heavy downward pressure on the stock. It's a \"show me\" type of company. But we broke $10 today, and most of the shorts really came in at the teens. A bit higher and we could see a short squeeze of legendary proportions.\n\nTL,DR: $CRC calls, or put credit spreads. I'd say May 2020 if you're ballsy, 2021-2022 leaps are good play. I'm currently doing both - naked calls for May 2020 at $10 strike, then 3 option bull strats for 2021-2022, a put credit spread and then a call on both. As well as the equity in my IRA and accounts with my financial advisor because I am a sick fuck. Feel free to inverse me and post positions.\n\nedit: RH positions so u mfs don't ban me, rest is just equity in my TDA and IRA but you tards wouldn't understand the graphics anyways. Depending on how the picture looks after Q4 earnings I plan on throwing a few thousand more in calls if it's good. Look for mgmt to make good progress on the 2L and give a meaningful update on JV/ORRI so we can hit that \\~$3bn overall debt mark. I think if that can happen no reason why over the next year or two this can't have another crazy run up. Their PV-10 reserves at $65 brent alone are worth \\~$5bn+, chuck in another $2bn of infrastructure assets and land holdings, if you run the numbers fair share price should be really in the $20s right now, which is where it was when brent was trading in this range back in May. Just lots of short pressure keeping it down.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/2Jciq4P](https://imgur.com/a/2Jciq4P)\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/wcFcmum](https://imgur.com/a/wcFcmum)\n\nCRC IR page if you want to look through their slides or find the webcasts/conference calls there's so much other shit but at this point I need a break to do some blow. If you ask I'll try and answer or admit my pea brain doesn't know and its a shitty thesis\n\n[https://crc.com/investor-relations](https://crc.com/investor-relations)", "created_utc": 1578775289, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/encxni/reiterating_crc_dd/", "is_self": true}
