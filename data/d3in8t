{"id": "d3in8t", "title": "A little look into SMAR shares.", "selftext": "  So I entered Oct 18 Calls morning of 9/11 on $SMAR for a few reasons.\n\n\\- I need to undo a couple of stupid plays I made the last few days.\n\n(some short term bullish news next)\n\n\\- (Daily Frequency) From 9/5-9/10 the price of the stock closed below the lower limits of its Bollinger Bands \u00ae. On 9/11 and 9/12, the price crossed back into the bands and has held inside so far. The upper and lower limits of the bands are extremely spread out right now as opposed to the past few weeks signaling high potential volatility to come. Being that the price is on the lower limits right now, I'm betting on it to go up to the higher limits in the coming month.\n\n\\- The RSI (relative strength index) crossed below and held the oversold line from 9/6-9/10. On 9/11 it crossed back above oversold line and is now @ a 36.91 value which isn't very far above the oversold trigger (30). (still, room to climb imo)\n\n\\-The Stochastic Oscillator also showed the price on a small bearish run from 8/29-9/6 with the %K trailing the %D. This however reversed on 9/9-9/10 with the %K line crossing above the %D while they were both under the 'oversold' trigger of the fast stochastic momentum indicator. It is a good buy signal when the %K crosses over the %D line while in oversold.\n\n(earnings stuff and ownership)\n\n\\-This is after a loss of 17cents vs anticipated loss of 24cents and on an adjusted basis a loss of 8 cents as opposed to an expected 16 cents.\n\n\\-Fiscal year revenue guidance was raised to between $265 and 268 million as opposed to $262-265.\n\n\\-This thing has an Institutional Ownership of 94.84% with 86,238,689 of the 91,000,000 taken up by institutions. (Some of the largest holders include: Insight Holdings, Vanguard, Morgan Stanley, Blackrock, JP Morgan, Abdiel Captial, Tiger Global. Increased Positions are up way above decreased positions too.\n\n\\-Just after the quarter data that sent the stock down, JP Morgan raises target from $47 to $48 and RBC Capital Raises to $60 from $54. That was both on 9/5 and the stock was down more days after that. A couple more firms have upgraded Smartsheet from hold to buy in the past couple days as well.\n\n\\-Only negative I see was a surprise with higher than anticipated adjusted loss per share for next quarter of between 18-19 cents. I feel very strongly that this thing can climb back up to 44-49 dollars in the short term.\n\n(my position)\n\nI've got 40C's, 45C's, and 50C's exp October. Up an average of 46% overall. Holding and looking for a continued run-up to at least $44. \n\nWhat do you think about these recent events and the stocks current value?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*Sources: Fidelity News + Events, NASDAQ website, Fidelity Advanced technical chart.", "created_utc": 1568341922, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d3in8t/a_little_look_into_smar_shares/", "is_self": true}
