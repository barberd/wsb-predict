Morgan Chase have joined with banks in California to provide \u201cforbearance on foreclosures and on mortgage payments.\u201d The governor said Bank of America did not agree to the same pledge.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Bank of America did not publicly commit to that,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cThey just committed to 30 days. I hope they will reconsider and join those other banks that are willing to do the right thing by at least extending that commitment to their customers for 90 days.\u201d\n\nBank of America spokesman Bill Halldin offered clarity on the bank\u2019s position and said they are pausing all foreclosures, evictions and repossessions around the country, including in California, at this time.\n\n\u201cBank of America is deferring mortgage payments on a monthly basis until the crisis is over,\u201d Halldin said, noting the bank is prepared to extend its pause beyond 90 days if necessary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/25/coronavirus-newsom-says-some-banks-have-committed-to-mortgage-waivers-for-residents-impacted-by-pandemic/](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/25/coronavirus-newsom-says-some-banks-have-committed-to-mortgage-waivers-for-residents-impacted-by-pandemic/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom that article alone, the messaging seems conflicted.
