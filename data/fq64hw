Calls doctor/hospital hoping to get tested for Covid19\n\n3. Doctors/hospitals/testing center has a \ncouple hundred Covid19 tests.\n\n4. They decide: \"better save these test kits for people that are critically sick, along with healthcare providers.\" They decline people who do not show severe symptoms.\n\n5. The people who encounter severe covid19 symptoms do so suddenly. \n\n6. Rushing to the hospital, they arrive needing oxygen ventilation immediately. At which time, it's too late to bother testing. They intubate, and assume he/she has covid, but they don't actually add it to the count. Person dies of Pnuemonia.\n\n7. Person does not get counted as an positive covid19, nor as a covid19 death.\n\nMexico is definitely pulling this stunt as well. Italy and Spain are probably are best bets at truthful data.
