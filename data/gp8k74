{"id": "gp8k74", "title": "Why I think $CRM calls are going to be a winner next week (FA+TA+Relative sector analysis & Options premium pricing approach fully explained)", "selftext": "Alright this is my first post in this sub. I'm a full-time daytrader that's turned 10k starting in June 2018 to as of this today, 585k equity balance, I primarily use a TA + early speculative approach and look to abuse any consistent patterns I find in the market place.   I'd always come lurk here for entertainment but recently I've seen a lot of good posts & picks that helped me make some bank. So, I'm giving back to this sub (or at least will try to) by sharing some of my findings & thinking. This will be a **LONG** post.\n\nAs you should all be familiar with by now, this earnings season has provided us with tons of opportunities to make multi-baggers, particularly in companies that has a business model/part of an industry that benefits from the pandemic. Stocks like $NFLX $AMZN $PTON $TTWO $ATVI $TWLO $W and so on have ran and exploded, although some sold off after earnings there is one thing that is consistent and that is they **ALL RAN UP HEADING INTO EARNINGS**.    \n\n\nSo what is next? I've been tracking many sectors & industries within the US market and I can tell you with absolutely certainty the cloud/software & tech space has been absolutely popping. Names like $OKTA $DOCU have been on a tear, $CRM $ESTC $CRWD $ZS $WDAY are following. The first \"cloud type\" earnings play I remember was $DBX, I had bought some OTM calls $23 & $24 a week before, then all of a sudden they went up 500% on the day of earnings , ofc the stock price did run up a lot heading into ER but that comes no where close to accounting for the spike on the calls, the real reason was an **IV premium spike** due to higher demand.     \n\n\nSo I did some digging and I see that $OKTA, $WDAY $CRM are reporting earnings next week, Wed May 27 for $WDAY and 28th for $OKTA & $CRM. I go to Yahoo Finance and check out the calls for all 3 stocks and I find that $OKTA's IV right now is sitting on avg mid 80s [https://i.imgur.com/wzAqkAB.png](https://i.imgur.com/wzAqkAB.png)\\_  \n$WDAY on avg is around 80 IV: [https://i.imgur.com/ZjPbq7C.png](https://i.imgur.com/ZjPbq7C.png)   \n$CRM on avg is at **55 IV**: [https://i.imgur.com/QeeJjwR.png](https://i.imgur.com/QeeJjwR.png)   \nWithout doing any further analysis yet, $CRM already became my main focus for next week, as the IV premium should spike almost certainly to upper 70+ ranges without accounting for price movement.   \n\n\nNow I go to the Technical analysis (TA) side of things: $OKTA [https://i.imgur.com/sjRYo5T.png](https://i.imgur.com/sjRYo5T.png) , this a beautiful uptrend and almost a straight line up, thing to note is daily RSI is over 80, combined with already high 85 IV on calls, this is a pass for me. To be clear, I am NOT saying $OKTA calls will not go up higher, I am simply saying the risk/reward here is not enticing to me, generally I like a minimum $1:3 risk-reward ratio with good probability of success.   \n\n\n$WDAY [https://i.imgur.com/g1yRPVy.png](https://i.imgur.com/g1yRPVy.png) Wonderful chart, setting up for bull break into earnings, I would want a position here too, \"problem\" is Earnings is Wed and US market opens Tuesday, so might be a problem for the PDT'ers out here. If IV was under 60, this definitely would've been my top pick instead. A beat/upwards momentum run here could also help $OKTA/$CRM run the following morning.   \n\n\n$CRM [https://i.imgur.com/yLxomIo.png](https://i.imgur.com/yLxomIo.png) The chart is bullish & clear uptrend with higher lows and higher highs as of now has yet to break the previous high to send it ballistic. This is partially the reason I believe the IV on calls are so low at 55 roughly, and If/When it does break out, the IV should catch up to it's peers around the 80+ IV levels assuming the others don't climb even HIGHER which very well could happen. So why $CRM on a TA basis? Because the most profitable options are before a large bull/bear break, **once it's started to break out, the IV gets reflected into the option price** and it becomes more difficult to get multi-baggers with higher premiums. The best time to buy is when the stock is in a clear trend but is still trading relatively flat.   \n\n\n**Tldr;** Buy $CRM calls next week b/c of dirt cheap IV, a great chart set up. Sell pre-earnings or diamond hands through them is your choice, not mine. Seriously though, it takes less than 1/10th of the time for you to read this compared to how long it took me to write. This is probably going to help you out in the long run unless you want to stick to the yolo & diamond hands life.   \n**Positions:** $CRM 180c , $185c, $200c May 29", "created_utc": 1590253946.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gp8k74/why_i_think_crm_calls_are_going_to_be_a_winner/", "is_self": true}
