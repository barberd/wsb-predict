{"id": "eddrs5", "title": "Options for Negative Stock Price??", "selftext": "So I know it's never happened before, but I have on good information that a certain publicly-traded stock is about to cross the $0.00 threshold and turn to a negative price per share. I want to profit off this, but RH seems to only list strike prices for positive prices for stocks? Doesn't seem to make much sense once you think about it. Anyone know of a broker that uses negative price options?\n\nBTW: Before anyone says I don't know what I'm talking about related to finance, I happen to have the equivalent of a Master's in Finance (watched Wolf of Wall St. 3 times, one time I looked up a stocker ticker on Yahoo Finance).", "created_utc": 1576865642, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eddrs5/options_for_negative_stock_price/", "is_self": true}
