{"id": "gazray", "title": "GoPro DD - buy calls up the ass", "selftext": "I've been GoPro user for 10 years. Before that I was using cheap stuff like 808 car keys camera, while I always wanted a 'bullet' cam like you used to see on the race cars. Problem is those things were way out of my price range, and all I wanted was something that I could attach and record useable footage when I go karting or driving. The original GoPro Hero (non-HD) existed at this time, but even those were out of my price range and the image quality didn't seem to justify the retail price.\n\nThen came the GoPro Hero HD, not long after 720P and 1080P became a household name. **The Hero HD was incredibly successful because it provided users the ability to capture high definition footage in conditions that were previously not possible.** Before that, if I wanted to capture footage of myself skydiving, I would need to wear a giant camcorder on my head. Or if I wanted to record myself surfing, I would need waterproof rig costing several thousand dollars. Because of GoPro's affordable access and incredible useability, the camera found itself an essential item for virtually every extreme sport. Worth noting is another brand, Contour HD, was an appealing camera that was also released. I purchased the Contour and owned it for a short while, because I love race cars and bullet cam=race car, but I ultimately decided that GoPro's mounting options and versaility was just far superior.\n\nGoPro eventually IPO'd. Both their cameras and their stock was one of the hottest things on the market. GoPro skyrocketed to over $90 a share.\n\nI was a happy owner of the Hero HD had purchased accessories such as extra batteries. As the HD2 and Hero HD3 came out, and 1080P remaining the standard, I didn't feel a need to upgrade immediately. After all, even to this day, 1080P is still good enough for most households. When the 4 came out, I found a 40% coupon on ebay, and it was a no-brainer to me. I got a better frame rate, better image quality, colors, etc. But I did have to buy different batteries. I would not have purchased the 4 at retail.\n\nThe 5 and 6 came out, and though I purchased the 6 for my girlfriend for a snorkel trip. The ability to go underwater without an extra case (the extra case made changing batteries/sd cards was a hassle and risky in the esp. in the wet) was a plus, but really I would not have purchased this without a 40% coupon.\n\nThat was a problem. Most everybody who needed an action camera already had one. The rise of quality cameras in smartphones, and chinese brands were coming out with decent action cameras for $50-$100 that did almost the same job for a fraction of the price didn't help GoPro either. The stock soared to levels it should have never been, and GoPro was left without a clear vision.\n\nThe stock fell from >$90 to $2 as they failed miserably trying their hand in drones and gimbals.  What possible future does GoPro have regurgitating a camera every year?\n\nI never felt a need to buy another GoPro, until I happened on the GoPro Max by accident while resuming work on a old idea I've had for a 360 mount. A 360 camera? That sounds interesting. I googled a couple videos and I was sold. I found a coupon for 20% off and purchased the Max for $400. For 10 years I refused to pay more than $250 for a GoPro, but this $400 purchase a no brainer. \n\nWhy? **I immediately recognized the one thing that sold me on my first GoPro: the MAX and 8 provided users the ability to capture footage in conditions that were previously not possible.** Bullet time with 1 camera? Check. 3rd person GTA view while doing anything? check. Mind-boggling good image stabilization? Check. Seriously check it out, you could hold a selfie stick 10 feet in the air shaking it around like a madman and still get stable footage.\n\nFor 10 years, a new GoPro wouldn't have allowed me to capture anything differently. But with these new cameras, it's different, and a world of possibility is opened as once was with the original Hero. \n\n**Other stuff:**\n\nCheck out their patents for stitching/stabilization. Good stuff. \nThey've been significantly cutting costs for a while now and were on track to make a profit\nRoadmap hasn't changed, before Covid they were already making a push towards direct online sales\nCovid kills the case for GoPro? I don't think so. With social distancing there's more than ever a desire \"to help you capture life as you live it, share the experience and pass on the stoke.\"\n360 camera + VR, what else do I have to say \n\n**TA (Testical Analysis):**\n\nComparing the revenue to market cap keeping in mind debt puts them in a good position IMO. At face value one sees failed venture, lack of innovation, and losing market share, GPRO was correctly being priced to go under. However, I believe the price currently does not taken into consideration the company's ongoing pivot, not to mention the incredible leap they've made in software.", "created_utc": 1588266582.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gazray/gopro_dd_buy_calls_up_the_ass/", "is_self": true}
