{"id": "f90z85", "title": "Coronavirus - Update", "selftext": "As we all have been hopeful that the market will recover, but what we hopeful people are not seeing is the data. There are 18 new cases in the US  231 new cases in S Korea, 72 new cases in Italy, and keeps on going up. For those who know how this works, or at least have played Plague, the growth of cases tend to be exponential. If this was contained in China, I would have kept hopeful, but this has spread in Italy, a tourism centered place (like Brazil and its Olympics in Plague), and US, even when they say they have it under control, they actually don't because they don't know everyone that is infected and how many people that person has infected, and what people those other people will infect. This will increase exponentially, cases will go from 70k to 100k in less than a week if the data comes through. There is probably 100k people infected but not everyone knows or has been confirmed. Someone who I forgot who it was said we had 3 months left of medicine, and at least we would have to wait 1 year to have a cure approved for humans. Yeah, this sounds like crap, but its something that has been said by corporations and governments that doesn't want to lose profit, and by scientists that have done the DD in depth. A market crash seems highly probable in the next weeks/months.", "created_utc": 1582589250, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f90z85/coronavirus_update/", "is_self": true}
