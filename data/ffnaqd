{"id": "ffnaqd", "title": "Good short and long term opportunity tomorrow with PRPL/PRPLW", "selftext": " I have been buying and selling PRPL and PRPLW since June of 2018. We should see a good bump from tomorrow's earnings call. Their CEO in an interview at silicon slopes in January revealed that they are doubling their manufacturing capacity this year which bodes well because their only major constraint for sales growth has been manufacturing capacity.   They also met their projected earnings from 2019 after Q3, so there should be another boost from exceeding last's year's earnings for the whole year.  There have been others posts about this stock in WSB that has more details and better technical analysis than I can write up.", "created_utc": 1583719078, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffnaqd/good_short_and_long_term_opportunity_tomorrow/", "is_self": true}
