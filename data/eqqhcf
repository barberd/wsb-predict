Saw they had a presentation at the JPMorgan's conference.  Loaded up on shares thinking we may get FDA news that day.  No FDA news but just some stuff to get investors buying.   Stock still went up 40%, very happy with the gains.  But I was very confident it was going up and would have put a call option in but never done one.  I'm very afraid I'm not going to execute it properly. \n\nHow would I have been able to capitalize on a 2 something dollar pop in a couple days?  I wanted to make sure I took full advantage of it and that's were I needed some help.\n\nNovavax was around the 4 dollar area before popping.   So I would have picked a couple dollars higher but if you geniuses could help I would appreciate it.", "created_utc": 1579400892, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eqqhcf/noob_here_that_makes_good_picks/", "is_self": true}
