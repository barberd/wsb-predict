Name the last organic like product that you actually have to cook yet you have to cook this \"meat\" for some reason? Carrots, potatoes, bananas, lettuce, all of which you don't have to cook before eating. This magic meat, you do have to cook. They dont even tell you what's in it but they slap in so many by products it vaguely tastes like meat. Yet 5 minutes after you take a bite you are running to the bathroom with explosive diarrhea and you are praying that you make it through the night. Like that guy is going to buy this fake meat again? I don't think so. Name one person who religiously eats this fake meat. Thats right you can't name one person. This Beyond Meat is a fucking scam and the numbers are being pumped up like Ponzi Scheme.", "created_utc": 1578968493, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eoeohc/bynd_is_a_scam_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
