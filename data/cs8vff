It finished Friday green.\n\n-A green finish Monday keeps the cycle of Friday to Monday continuation, while also being the third instance of finishing 3 consecutive days green. \n\nPrediction; Amazon will finish green tomorrow by less than 1.25%.\n\nOutside of Monday, I am bearish on Amazon and will construct my iron condors with a bearish lean, selling the high premium calls I feel are likely due to a green Monday.\n\nIf you have a complaint about my DD, be sure to message the mod you think is the most gay and leave a complaint.
