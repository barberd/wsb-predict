{"id": "cnvzpv", "title": "HPE is fucking worthless", "selftext": "Alright peoples, since everyone is looking downwards, here's a company that is absolutely going to get CRUSHED. \n\n\\-First, HPE essentially sells servers, with a good part of its revenue coming from it. With the trade war, components are becoming more expensive. But, they have to deal with all other competitors both Chinese (Lenovo, Huawei, ZTE) and American (Cisco, IBM, etc). Additionally, the refresh cycle for servers themselves have changed. Clients are either not buying them as frequently, or moving completely towards the cloud (AMZN, MSFT Azure, etc). So essentially market forces are biting HPE's sausage from three ends. \n\n\\-Second, HPE is pursuing a refresh in its strategy that is very risky. They are spending on trying to diversify (Aruba networking and Cray supercomputing), which unfortunately costs a boatload of money. They've been trying to buy other companies too when valuation has been incredibly high, especially in tech. How are they funding it? Debt. Due to the market forces above of refresh cycles slowing down and people going towards shared resources/cloud, the revenue gain from these new companies will still be very slow. \n\n\\-Second-and-a-half. HPE recently introduced their new Greenlake strategy which is essentially leasing their equipment to you as a subscription. Leasing is nothing new, but in the tech world, companies either pay and completely own, or they use a cloud service. If you want to own, you would own (something cheaper, like from IBM) and maintain everything in-house. If you want hands off, you would go into the cloud. This strategy is the worst of both parts - having to maintain something you don't really own, and still have the risk of things going offline and having almost no support. \n\n\\-Third, HPE is essentially leveraged to the hilt already. No one wants to buy HPE stock and they can't really issue more without severely diluting, which is the reason why its capital infusion strategy in the past years has been debt driven, pumped by the cheap interest rates. \n\nSo, revenue is dropping from the cycle change. Costs are increasing due to its expansion strategy. Money will become harder and harder to get. The only thing they do have are patents (but fuck it, China can just copy them). Instead of shorting TSLA or whatever popular stock, take a look at this shitty company that used to be a part of another shitty company which made shitty printers.", "created_utc": 1565317716, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cnvzpv/hpe_is_fucking_worthless/", "is_self": true}
