Caution, my last play didn't go well:\n\n* An SPY Guide - $5000 put in, total loss of $2368 ([Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5zf9o/the_normie_playbook_an_spy_guide_to_the_days_ahead/), [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g8krsz/the_normie_playbook_a_terrifying_spy_update/), [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gd2zbu/the_normie_playbook_wait_is_this_happening/))\n\n# A Bullish Case\n\nStock market rallies don't simply end because people wake up one day in mass and decide things are over priced.  There's a catalyst.  Lacking a catalyst, assuming current assumptions around the COVID-19 recovery hold true, it's fair to expect the market to work higher.  Sprinkle in FED action, which while down 89% from  it's 3/25 peak, still dumped another $65 billion into the financial system.\n\nBulls are expecting a quick recovery, and while battered, they haven't been knocked off that position.  There's continued discussion around a vaccine, optimism, stage 2 trials, and numerous companies and universities pursuing it.  We're north of 300k daily tests, and the positive test rate is declining, states are reopening, we got through Easter, and we found remdesivir effective.  P/E is high, but even if you believe that governments are propping equities up, this ponzi scheme still puts US equities at the top, likely to bleed the least and profit the most.  It's not to say a dip wasn't warranted, it was just an over-reaction, hope you enjoyed the ride back to appropriate valuations.\n\nMoney right now is easy.  Interest rates are low, and will remain there, maybe even negative, with a FED heavily accommodating of markets.  Liquidity is flowing like rain, banks across the globe are jumping on the QE train.  Shorting the market is shorting the governments ability to continue the rally, and as Buffet says, don't bet against America.  \n\nOh, and guess what, Congress is going to hand everyone more money.\n\n* [Considering another stimulus package](https://www.businessinsider.com/heres-what-the-phase-4-stimulus-package-might-look-like-2020-4)\n* [Zillow expects home prices to rebound next year](https://www.zillow.com/research/prices-sales-forecast-coronavirus-26975/)\n* [US Treasury borrowing 3 trillion this quarter](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/05/04/us-treasury-seeks-to-borrow-a-record-3-trillion-this-quarter.html)\n* [Interest rates down, mortgage applications up 7% from prior week, refi applications doen 2% week over week but 210% increase year to year](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/06/weekly-mortgage-applications-show-real-recovery-in-homebuying.html)\n* [Duke professor says downturn is over by end of 2020 with a vaccine, U shape, highlights Oxford](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/economic-expert-with-perfect-record-calling-recessions-is-betting-this-one-will-be-over-by-the-end-of-2020-2020-05-06)\n* [Fauci talks positive Modenra vaccine optimism](https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2020/05/06/fauci-singles-out-moderna-s-coronavirus-vaccine-as.html)\n\n# A Bearish Case\n\nDespite the optimism, the Fed can't create demand.  Consumer spending is not going to come back to where it was.  Millions will remain unemployed, the jobs aren't all coming back.  The idea of a V shaped recovery is ridiculous, even a U shaped recover is irrational.  Given the market expects such a recovery, the theta from news is going to burn bulls, day over day as the recovery doesn't manifest with the expected velocity, gravity of expectations will pull bulls to the ground.\n\nJune will see auto delinquencies appear in servicer reports, by end of July extensions 3 month payment extensions run out, auto repossessions will begin again, and the extra unemployment comes to a close.  With September comes standard unemployment insurance running out for initial layoffs, followed by the end of our foreclosure moratorium. \n\nNow imagine we never get a vaccine, it's never proved easy for other SARs diseases, why would this one be any different?  The market hasn't priced in a significant bounce.  States reopening too soon.  The US outside NY/NJ/PA still rising in case counts, and people are sick of being quarantined.  Oh, and good luck getting the US culture to adopt masks.\n\nThe market expects COVID to be beaten, when the reality is it needs to be endured.  We've shot most of our stimulus shots, we shot wildly and while some hit, we wasted too much and we will pay in time.  This virus will be with us for years, and so will the impacts.  The world is heading for a recession, and they'll drag the US right down with them. \n\n* [More people will die because we reopen](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/reopening-states-will-cause-233000-more-people-to-die-from-coronavirus-according-to-wharton-model-120049573.html)\n* [CDC projects possible May surge in cases and deaths](https://www.axios.com/cdc-projections-coronavirus-may-june-a96726e7-acc8-4855-b603-dc6518f560f5.html)\n* [Consumer debt reaches $14.3 trillion, $1.6 trillion more than prior high in 2008](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/05/05/consumer-debt-hits-new-record-of-14point3-trillion.html)\n* [Layoffs turning permanent](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-06/temporary-coronavirus-layoffs-are-turning-permanent-around-u-s)\n* [US pushes WHO to defy china and invite Taiwan to discuss COVID](https://news.yahoo.com/us-demands-invite-taiwan-meeting-171658691.html)\n* [States running out of unemployment funds, federal reserves almost 50% depleted](https://www.wjbf.com/news/states-are-running-out-of-unemployment-money-but-claimants-shouldnt-worry/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter_WJBF)\n* [Bankruptcy steady at pre-covid levels, but the wave is coming](https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/biblical-wave-bankruptcies-about-flood-us)\n* [Google planning for employees at home until 2021](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/coronavirus-google-facebook-work-from-home-2021-latest-a9505936.html)\n* [Germany calls US claim COVID is man made in China an intentional distraction from Trump's mistakes](https://www.thelocal.de/20200508/germany-shuns-trumps-claims-covid-19-outbreak-was-caused-by-chinese-lab-leak)\n* [SPY has net outflows of $9.7 billion in past 30 days, QQQ has inflows of $5 billion](https://www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/guid/99DBCE24-9075-11EA-9208-AF2E6FA5B5BC)\n* [Warm temperatures and humidity ineffective in slowing COVID spread](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus-summer-temperature-warm-hot-spread-study-pandemic-a9506201.html?utm_term=Autofeed&utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1588971997)\n* [United scraps bond sale due to lack of interest](https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2020-05-08/united-air-scraps-2-25-billion-bond-sale-as-demand-disappoints)\n\n# My Take\n\nBoth cases above have some FUD, but both also have merits. \n\nFirst, separate Main Street (consumer and production economy) from Wall Street (financial markets), as they are different.  The FED can do wonders for financial markets and in turn Wall Street, but it can't manifest demand.  Congress can.  Stimulus can.\n\nThere likely will be another round of stimulus and it'll boost spending, can kicked down the road.  Now it may not come until June, but US equities are strong and as long as the assumption holds, so will the near term impact of it's expected arrival.  Sure, the house of cards may fall in time, but what's going to bring it down?  We lack a clear short term catalyst.\n\nThe bulls ate more straw off our camel's back than bears threw on.  States are reopening, there's talk of more stimulus, curves are flattening, positive treatments, vaccine's progressing, and the market is recovering.  The bearish news is the unknown, the whispers in the wind, we'll see in two weeks, wait until September, and the reality that so much is wrong with Main Street, that things can't be this positive with Wall Street.  Can't say they're wrong, but they don't weigh as much.  The market's priced in awful Q2 results, with no guidance, and a market that by it's nature wants to rise, there's little besides whispers to hold it down.\n\n# In Search of a Catalyst\n\nSo what could bring what we feel, and the equity market into better alignment?  We need a catalyst, some options:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Consumer Spending** \\- Eventually, Wall Street and the financial market is still tied to Main Street and the need for production via demand from a consumption economy.  If unemployment remains low, and wages decrease, you can throw stimulus at it, but spending will drop.  As spending drops, the volume of decline, if severe, can open up a world of hurt for equities as guidance and P/E fall as a reaction.\n* **Bankruptcies and Defaults** \\- Governments can solve liquidity issues and prop up prices, but good luck fixing the solvency of a business when margins crash due to lack of spending and debts exceed the ability for business (or people) to pay them.  Less hoarding cash by businesses (profitable for financial institutions), more drawing down (cash crunch), more borrowing.  Add to that regulatory tightening for banks post 2008 and minimum levels required will strain them further.  All this can create a rush to hoard cash, which will restart a massive equity outflow.  The challenge is, I don't see this coming near term, even if you believe it is coming.\n* **The Dollar** \\- The dollar is the standard of the world, but that's not always great, especially when supply causes issues.  When you have massive debt that results in bankruptcies, the money supply starts to dwindle as unemployment ramps, confidence fades, money gets hoarded, and deflation sets in.  This unavailability of dollars is a huge risk.  Currencies are getting crushed by the dollar, negative interest rates could become a trigger of insolvency, an outflow of equities to generate cash, and a massive crash as a result.\n* **Significant COVID Resurgence** \\- Obviously, anything approaching a country wide lock down in the US will send markets back to their knees.\n* **Guidance** \\- As the recovery comes, guidance will return.  More than half of Wall Street has pulled guidance, less than a quarter are expected to offer full year guidance, and analysts are flying blind.  As that spigot turns back on, the reality of impacts could be more bearish than expected similar to how we saw with Q1 under-performing.  CEO's tapering FY21 expectations, discussing reduced consumer sentiment, shifts in culture, and a recovery that carries deep into 2022 could be enough to tip companies to truer valuations. \n* **Reality** \\- As all of the above hit in less severe degrees, there is the sum of parts which becomes significant enough that equities fall, perhaps not at an accelerated pitch, but fall significantly all the same.\n\nNone of the above are assured.  There is an ever increasing reality that this market has a bottom.  I struggle to comprehend that at times, and there are so many threads to pull that can crumble things.  But perhaps the FED is able to unwind QE without impact, perhaps the dollar's global position is the strength needed for the US to recover faster despite being hit harder.  Perhaps.  \n\nRight now, my sentiment is short term bull.  Medium term uncertain.  Long term bear.  Unclear on if we've found bottom.  This past week has trended bullish across the board.\n\n# The Next Play\n\nThe only thing this weekend tells me is: be patient.  It's unclear our direction, even in the near term.  I could make a case in either direction.  This week, is going to be a short term week.  I'll avoid holding overnight, avoid going long (barring very clear signals), and will play the swings (up or down) as my TA dictates.  \n\nI like to end \"plays\" when a theme shifts, it helps me avoid chasing losses, so that's what I'm doing and I now consider my prior play done, and failed.  I've allocated another $5000 to a new play, I'll call this play \"Patiently Waiting\".  I expect most positions this week to be smaller, in the $500 to $1000 range, in and out, and I'll be surprised if I fully deploy my allocated capital at one time.\n\nI don't have a planned entry.  I doubt I do anything before noon on Monday, if Monday at all.  I'll create a shorter post once I find my entry, and will track critical TA for the week as well as the profitability of the play in there.\n\n# TLDR\n\nThere's a bull case, there's a bear case, the bull's had a stronger week.  Many links, much news.  No clear TA giving confidence in a position, will take short term day trades while waiting for clarity to emerge, will add a post later to track how much I lose.", "created_utc": 1589051570.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ggllpl/the_normie_playbook_lacking_a_catalyst/", "is_self": true}
