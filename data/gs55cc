{"id": "gs55cc", "title": "Missed $DKNG and $PENN? $GAN is the real sports gambling play", "selftext": "$GAN is essentially the SaaS provider that powers online gambling. It is a pure play on the growth of online betting and should see a huge spike when professional sports return. It recently IPO\u2019d and should see a huge run similar to DKNG. \n\nGAN and Fan Duel signed a long-term partnership deal last year. March 2020 GAN signed a deal with PENN along with Michigan's Sault Ste tribe of Chippewa Indians as their latest clients.\n\nThe big news, in my opinion, which hasn't been made public is a partnership with a major U.S. casino. GAN has said \"it could not reveal the client\u2019s name, as they sought anonymity until they received regulatory approval.\" Some have speculated MGM Grand to be this anonymous client.\n\nThey have an exclusive deal to be the provider for Fan Duel as they role out gambling in additional states. \n\n\"We are currently supporting FanDuel\u2019s operations in the States of Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Indiana. FanDuel has a unilateral option to require GAN to support its online launch into any additional intra-State US markets which permits Internet gambling during the contract term, with such launch to take place within six (6) months of the state publishing regulations defining the technical requirements for undertaking the operations of such Internet gambling. Our agreement with FanDuel provides that we will be the exclusive provider of their casino gaming operations for the initial three years following a launch date. \"\n\nRather than trying to predict which casino or app will dominate online gambling, pick the software company powering all of them. \n\nTL;DR - Buy GAN shares because it doesn\u2019t have options yet (I probably lost 90% of the sub with that)", "created_utc": 1590667982.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gs55cc/missed_dkng_and_penn_gan_is_the_real_sports/", "is_self": true}
