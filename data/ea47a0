People on this sub see their hookers depositing their venmo payments into their robinhood accounts. It's that i have adblocker but when i am on my phone 1/2 of all commercials are either from eToro, a daytrader who is willing to learn you trade stocks for $1000 a course, or basicly an unlimited amount of banks ING, Barclays, RBS, Loyds and Deutsche that want to invest your money in the stockmarket. And i understand, the ECB is sucking up corporate &amp; goverment bonds like a whore on crack. Interest rates are so low everyone is buying real estate and stocks like crazy. \n\nBut its diffrent now, the EU is never going to see positive intrest rates again, birth rates are tanking so inflation targets are never going to get achieved. The Bank of Japan is not only buying bonds but is also buying real estate and stocks. In 2020 the BoJ is going to be the largest shareholder on the nikei stock exschange. the same faith is going to await europe and then North America. So if you are waiting for a recession you are going to get it. If you are waiting for a stock market crash, that is just not going to happen. The central banks are going to keep pumping it up.\n\nIm just going to hold ETF's untill my goverments forces me to sell them to the ECB, hopefully at a profit.", "created_utc": 1576244916, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ea47a0/this_is_not_a_pump_dump_scheme_but_a_pump_pump/", "is_self": true}
