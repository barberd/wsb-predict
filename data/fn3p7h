I don\u2019t have a degree in finance, I trade options as a hobby, and I fuckin love the banter that goes on in this sub.  Being that the select few actually who know things about options do me the kindness of posting their well thought out DD, I figured I\u2019d give some of my own DD on the various outcomes and their possible lengths of time so that we can all stop speculating about tHiS WiLl Be oVeR iN tWo WeEkS or the alternative doomsday hypotheses.  The data I\u2019ll be going off is how the world is currently in terms of the rapidity of rising cases. We\u2019ll use this to speculate different outcomes from here so we can all time the market and donate to our local healthcare organizations on payday.\n\nAs I\u2019m writing this, in the US we have rapidly spreading cases in the areas where COVID-19 is present (NY, WA, CA, and NJ is up and coming).  In those places life as we know it has shut down.  In the smaller cities in the US and states with < 100 cases, things are ramping up but big change hasn\u2019t yet been enacted.  We have increased testing, which certainly can account for some of the increased reporting of cases, regardless our doubling time is now around 24-36 hours.  This is why governor Newsom of CA enacted the statewide shutdown, because if he didn\u2019t, with the doubling time there would be 26 million people infected in 8 weeks. This is not unique to New York or California, they simply are a few weeks ahead of the states that are only reporting double digit cases as of today.  A quarter of Americans are on functional lockdown, if it hasn\u2019t gotten to you yet, the shutdown is coming.\n\nI think the naysayers are becoming fewer and fewer as the world wakes up to the gravity of the situation, but I would like to say at this point our biggest enemy is the rapidly decreasing doubling time, and the only way to fight it is through quarantine and social distancing. Flattening the curve is imperative, if we don\u2019t we are risk of overwhelming our healthcare system resulting in full wartime triage mode as has happened in [parts of Italy](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-to-triage-patients-who-need-intensive-care/).\n\nSo, what happens next?\n\nThere are a few scenarios.\n\n# \n\n# A drug that is already approved and widely produced is found to be effective in treating COVID-19.\n\nThis is the best-case scenario.  One example is the drug that was shuttled through the pipelines this week is hydroxychloroquine (I hate the stuff, makes water taste like chlorine for 8 hours after you take it) -- it\u2019s a drug that\u2019s been used for years to treat malaria.  There isn\u2019t a beautiful double-blinded placebo-controlled case series for use of it in COVID-19, but I laid eyes on the prelim data they\u2019re talking about and the anecdotal evidence for treatment seems hopeful at least.  In theory, this would work how Tamiflu works for influenza --- it won\u2019t \u201ccure\u201d COVID-19, but it would save us all by decreasing the burden on the healthcare system by decreasing the duration and severity of symptoms in those infected. Speaking to an epidemiologist, if we have a treatment such as this it will downgrade the pandemic to a containable pandemic.\n\n**For the market:**\n\nA successful, already approved, mass-producible, safe medication to reduce severity of illness is the ONLY scenario I can see in which we could maybe have the \u201cV-shaped return\u201d of the market our Commander in Chief is touting.  I still don\u2019t think it will be V-shaped by any means, but at least the uncertainty of apocalypse would wane in the coming weeks.\n\n**Issues with this:**  Production and distribution.  It would be slow, and then it would be a bit faster, but still slow, and then it would pick up, but not enough to make everyone happy.  The silver lining here:  Trump signed the Defense Production Act, which means we could potentially have every capable pharmaceutical company work together to make millions of units a month.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# An already available drug doesn\u2019t work, and a different drug is approved as successful treatment\n\nThe drugs Gilead, Regeneron, and others are working on function similarly to Tamiflu, a viral neuraminidase inhibitor, which basically inhibits an enzyme that allows the virus to successfully replicate.  This could work beautifully, but it would take a while.\n\n**For the market:**\n\nIf the existing drugs don\u2019t work, the fastest timeline (even with Trump lifting red tape) to get a new drug approved and start producing is on the order of months, during which time the number of cases continues in [an exponential curve](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/) and we reach millions infected from the unchecked spread.\n\n**Issues with this:**\n\nSlower timeline / potentially low yield reward \u2013 we make drugs like this all the time, and sometimes you spend years developing a new protease inhibitor or a drug to stop viral entry into the cell and they simply don\u2019t work.  That\u2019s why HIV was initially so hard to treat with drugs: every time we\u2019d block a receptor for cell entry it would just use a different one, every time we blocked an enzyme the virus uses it would just use a different one to circumvent. HAART therapy for HIV that we finally landed on as successful treatment blocks cell entry and inhibits several different enzymes to cripple the virus via different pathways at the same time. We all know how that went in the 80s -- it could take years to come up with a successful combination therapy to give COVID the ol\u2019 1-2.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Existing drugs don\u2019t work, the new drugs we\u2019re making aren\u2019t effective, and we have to wait for a vaccine.\n\nThe sentence above doesn\u2019t sound all that bad until you really think about it.  The absolute fastest we could make a vaccine available to the public on a mass scale  is probably around a year from now.  There are so many problems with finding a vaccine that works at every step:  find an antigen (a structure that an antibody can bind to) that the virus will always express to target; find an antigen that we can make specific antibodies to; how long will immunity last? Can we do it without using live virus particles?\n\nHIV has been around for decades, and we now have control of the virus through therapy (downgrades it in terms of pandemic severity, right??).  So why don\u2019t we have a vaccine?  Two reasons -- one because the sugar-proteins present on the outside of the virus are similar to sugar-proteins present in a lot of cells in our own body, so its very difficult to make antibodies to them.  The second reason is because HIV destroys your immune system, [but that's not important right now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLpBtDRkuD8).  The idea here is that a vaccine could work if we find the right target, but then you have to see if it\u2019s safe (do people die when you give it to them? Do they get sick? How sick?)  You have to see if it works (Do people get COVID-19 when you give it to them? *How do you know they don\u2019t*? How many people get it?  Does it stop infection by 100% or 50%?)  Basically after it\u2019s deemed safe, you have to make sure it\u2019s effective by giving it to people and putting them out into the population to see if they get COVID, if they don\u2019t then you go back and start mass producing it and give to more people, reassess and repeat.  If the vaccine isn\u2019t effective and patients do get COVID, or perhaps even *if more of them get it* (which happened with some HIV vaccine trials) then you\u2019re back to the drawing board, and repeat.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What does the world look like if we have to wait 12-18 months for a treatment?**\n\nIn my opinion?  Worldwide quarantine, worldwide social distancing.  No air travel unless you have an approved reason, complete shutting of international borders, probably shutting of state borders.  A world without treatment and without a vaccine *is a bad world*.  New York City was called to shutdown after just 250 cases.  There simply isn\u2019t a world in which we could get below a few hundred cases in *any major city* without very successful treatment or a vaccine.  What does this look like for the next 12-18 months?  Quarantine for weeks, cases drop from tens of thousands to hundreds, perhaps double digits, loosen restrictions, life returns to semi-normal, then cases jump, quarantine for weeks\u2026 repeat.  The virus is spread so easily, the first reported case in the United States was 9 weeks ago tomorrow, and now we\u2019re in the tens of thousands.  The only way to stop spread is to have a treatment for current infections or go to zero cases, otherwise it\u2019s just a waxing and waning quarantined / global shutdown life until we get a vaccine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How does the market look in this scenario?**\n\nPuts on life as we know it, my dudes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The final broad range scenario** is a treatment is ineffective, no new drugs work, and a vaccine isn\u2019t as effective as we want it to be.  In this scenario, some small percentage of the world dies (0.5% mortality would be in the 10s of millions), and we just rely on [herd immunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity) to eventually get us through it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The good news\n\nSo, **the good news** is there are a lot of different scenarios in which this will become a very scary thing of the past, as any one of these scenarios (except the last) could produce effective therapy, or any combination of them could work too \u2013 hey, maybe hydroxychloroquine is somewhat effective, we get a few new Tamiflu-like drugs, and we get a vaccine in a year.  You would never know it from this, but I\u2019m quite the optimist, and I tend to think something along these lines is the more likely outcome rather than nothing works and we wait at home for a year for the world to go back to normal.  Either way, the bottom line is:  this isn\u2019t almost over.  The 2-4 week self-quarantines are the first step, not the solution. You need to get that in your heads.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# In the meantime:\n\nFlattening the curve \u2013 follow your local recommendations please.  Socially distance yourselves.  Have skype drinking parties.  Jack off across the room from your bro, not next to him.\n\nProtect your elders \u2013 buy them groceries, encourage them to stop going to public places, go to pick up supplies for them, explain how they are at risk (mortality rates are around 8-10% for those in their 70s, 14%+ for those in their 80s).  Otherwise healthy 60, 70, 80 year-olds are also at risk, it isn\u2019t just gran with a heart condition.\n\nStay safe.  Be smart.  Wash your hands.  Don\u2019t be dickhole and scoff at quarantines.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Disclaimer \u2013 this is all speculation.  I will not give individual medical advice.  If you have questions about your health or that of a loved one please contact your physician or go in person for evaluation and treatment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:  TL;DR for the most of you:  From a medical standpoint, this isn't almost over.  There are a lot of ways to return to normalcy, the best of them would see life back to normal on the order of  months, the worst could be 1-2 years -- with variable economic fallout depending on what your poison is. Protect your elders and be smart about not contributing to the spread.  Volatility is still very high. Use it to your advantage if you want.
