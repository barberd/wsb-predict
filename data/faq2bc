Our world is one where a normal job won't get you ahead in life, and barely gets you by.\n\nThe rules have changed. The younger generations don't have a stake in the success of society. **We don't give a fuck about it.** \n\nWe loose nothing if it fails, we're already at bottom, and most of us don't want to be alive anyways.\n\nRemember, **you did this**. \n\nYes, there will be some comment about some faggot who's doing well, probably because he sucked someone's dick. That's not the point - the point is the **AVERAGE** person used to have a great life on an **AVERAGE** salary. \n\nThat is no longer the case, the **AVERAGE** person with an **AVERAGE** salary today, has a shitty life, and that's why we gamble.\n\nIf I loose everything, I'm not much worse off than I am now; and there's never been a better time in history to be rich.\n\nWe're not greedy, we just want the carrot we were promised after going through your bullshit scam schooling system for 20 years.\n\nI should've just stayed in the military, at least I'd probably be dead.", "created_utc": 1582869058, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/faq2bc/attention_boomerberg_magazine_you_did_this/", "is_self": true}
