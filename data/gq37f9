Their newest site, Aphria Diamond, is supposed to be capable of producing 120,000 kg (51% owned by Aphria). The company waited 18 months for approval on this site.\n\nAphria One, has its own power generation facility. Electricity is generated by the combustion of natural gas. The site is claimed to be mostly autonomous with human interaction only needed in the earliest stages of growth cycle and in the final stage (trimming and pruning).\n\nTheir Broken Coast site can produce 5,000 kg. (Acquired in 2018)\n\nThe end of the lottery structure for licenses will prove to be a boon for Aphria, now and into the future.\n\n...\n\nAphria Diamond appears to be far less autonomous.\n\nAlthough things look to be moving fast at the Aphria Diamond site. There was a recent post for 50 job openings at the site. It is not just part-time or contract work. It is permanent full-time work. That seems like a bold move in the midst of a recession. Here is the link to the posting: [https://www.jobbank.gc.ca/jobsearch/jobposting/32385970](https://www.jobbank.gc.ca/jobsearch/jobposting/32385970)\n\nThis additional production capacity will most likely be used to address the need that will arise from Canada's \"Cannabis 2.0\". With Aphria entering the derivatives market their margins, revenues/profits will continue to increase with each quarter that passes. Derivatives are estimated to take around 30% of the recreational market by 2021 in Canada.\n\nThere is strong growth in Europe as well. A majority of Aphria's revenues come from Europe (CC Pharma)\n\nThe company was sitting on $515,000,000 CAD cash/cash equivalents at the end of last quarter. That is a strong cash position in the current economic situation. Weed companies are going bust and Aphria may be in a nice spot to acquire said companies for pennies on the dollar, further boosting their production capacity. \n\nMost Price Targets from multiple sources ranges from around $5.50 to $8.50.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPositions: 2000 shares, APHA 7/17/20 $7.00C, 10/16/20 $3.00C & $4.50C, 1/15/21 $4.00C, $4.50C, and $5.00C, 01/21/22 $3.00C & $5.00C.", "created_utc": 1590375897.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gq37f9/apha_their_largest_canadian_production_site_may/", "is_self": true}
