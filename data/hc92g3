How about  past close? \n\nIf you bought a $308 Put the final minute of close seeing that big red candle (expecting a sell-off after hours) it could have been bought for $.02 and sold for $1.87 the final minute of trading (4:14pm).  \n\n[https://imgur.com/a/EDoODvk](https://imgur.com/a/EDoODvk)\n\n\\---\n\nThe risk is asymmetrical and has positive skew b/c even if SPY moved against you after hours the order book is deep enough you could still have sold those options for $.02 after a minute or two if the sell-off trend didn't continue. Upside potential was great ... the options moved in the money and the contracts increased in value quickly (all the way to >90x cost). Food for thought. \n\nNote: if you look at the level 2 data the order book only went about 100 contracts deep for intrinsic value if you wanted to sell. You would probably have serious slippage trying to trade more contracts and get terrible fills -- if you tried to scale this up bigger (100+ contracts), worse case, you just get assigned ..most brokers will automatically sell at market open the next b-day. You would be short SPY if you didn't have the cash when assigned, but you still would net crazy money on proceeds when your broker sold to close your short position. \n\nAnything I am not thinking about here autists? \n\nTransaction costs would kill you if SPY didn't move and you just quickly entered and exited a position at $.02. Someone please trade this strategy and report back when you lose everything or buy a yacht. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Trade SPY options after hours (until 4:15pm) to maximize tendies.", "created_utc": 1592602105.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hc92g3/trading_spy_o_dte_options_after_close_up_to_415pm/", "is_self": true}
