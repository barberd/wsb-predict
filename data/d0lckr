I feel like sht every Monday because I had to wake up, open my robinhood, go to AMD, select Sell Call, set a good but 99% unreachable goal unless it is earning\u2019s week, set expirations the following week, and watch as money gets transfers from your robinhood account onto mine\u2019s. I just rinse and repeat the following week while changing the strike price to make sure none of you retards will ever make it rich from my call.  Every week you come back thinking this week is the week I\u2019m be rich. \n\nTLDR: Feels like a drug dealers selling fake drugs to you guys for that high that you will never get but somehow you always come back for more.", "created_utc": 1567798186, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d0lckr/i_feel_like_sht_selling_weekly_calls_to_you/", "is_self": true}
