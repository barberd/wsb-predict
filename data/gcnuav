My position is firmly away from the trend, so I am going about living my shelter-at-home life.  I figure that, at least, I am not slowly asphyxiating in a sports area hastily transformed to a makeshift hospital.\n\n(Possible unpopular opinion): The Fed can't replace the economy, can't prop it up forever, and are likely not to not continue once it is clear they cannot functionally control, contain, or address the damage that has already happened.\n\nThis is where \"Rogue One\" comes in.\n\nThe view on this beach is great. There is a lovely sunset, and far off in the distance, you can see the shock wave traveling at terminal velocity across the face of the planet towards us. Pretty. I wonder if I can roast a marshmallow on a shock wave.\n\n* So whole industries such as restaurants, cruise lines, and hospitality are 40+ days into a near zero income, are not likely to acquire adequate cash to deal with ongoing expenses for the duration of the crisis, and are facing multiple years of lower consumer demand\n* Reopening the economy now is basically like pouring Robitussin into an open compound fracture.  Reopening now absolutely does not solve the fundamental math problems of the Covid-19 crisis, and will only create a resurgence or a second wave, or both\n* Regardless of how well we handle the first, we are very likely to see a second wave, which will likely need to be dealt with the same way the first one was (that should go over very well)\n* The crest of first wave hasn't even reached all of the county yet. People are still getting sick in increasing numbers in some places in the country, and the only way to stop is quickly becoming wildly unpopular with a vocal minority\n* So many people are out of work, that the knock-on effects of unemployment on this scale can cause a recession and cripple any number of consumer goods companies without even considering other effects (of which there are legion)\n\nSo the damage is already done, the compounding and knock-on effects are piling up, thankfully we have a solid pillow fort built from sacks of money to keep us safe.  Anyone looking at the horizon can see that there is a shock-wave hurtling towards us.  I, for one, am curious what it will feel like to be converted to human paste and cooked in pico seconds.\n\nI don't exactly know what is going to make it clear that the Fed cannot buy up the entire economy, cant hire 6 in 10 Americans, and can't scare away the boogy man by making it rain new crisp bills. If I had to guess, I would say we shall see in November when the second round of shelter-at-home orders comes down to deal with our old pal exponential growth.\n\nRIP my positions (until November, then RIP everything).\n\nPart I: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fsgiso/the\\_darkest\\_timeline\\_the\\_markets\\_and\\_idiocracy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fsgiso/the_darkest_timeline_the_markets_and_idiocracy/)\n\nPart II:\n\nOmitted Due to having the Name of the Chairman of the Fed in the Title...
