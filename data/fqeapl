It was announced that they will be closing an additional 300. They run a total of about 5,000 stores.\n\nIn case you autists are bad at math, that\u2019s about 10% of all their stores and at this rate, of 200-300 stores closing per month, you\u2019re looking at bankruptcy faster than you can say Gay Bear. \n\nGameStop called their business essential during the recent store shutdowns which proves they know they are screwed. This is only the beginning of their stores closing as they continue to hemorrhage money faster than the fed going brrrrr.\n\nEdit: Tl;Dr GME $3p 4/20", "created_utc": 1585374151.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqeapl/gamestop_to_close_another_300_stores_permanently/", "is_self": true}
