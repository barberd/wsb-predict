{"id": "g1x0y4", "title": "DD from 4/14-4/15, Echostar, Hasbro, Yelp and shit, TLDR and Plays included", "selftext": "Welcome back to the WSB DD Summary! This is for 4/14-4/15. I\u2019m your host and resident autist u/expander2. You have to be able to read to gain anything from this so that rules out about half of you. As always, this is organized from most important at the top to least important at the bottom. A TLDR, plays, and previous DD summaries will be at the bottom. My last posts still stand and hold some good info so check it out for more plays if this isn't enough for you greedy fucks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, I'm gonna open this one with a little fuck you. I hope you assholes have been actually following these summaries because guess what? Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) did exactly what I said it would. I made 190% gains on that play. Today, Lakeland Industries (LAKE) jumped in the morning netting me and a few people that invested with me (I've got the DM's to prove it) a 210% gain on them. I can't promise you'll make money following my advice but I've been 100% right this week. So on to the DD I suppose.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter [reading this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g13vq0/buy_calls_on_echostar_sats_buying_now_is_the/) about Echostar (SATS) and doing a little of my own research I know that they are gonna be a good move. Echostar owns HughesNet which is satellite internet for areas where there are no fiber optic cables and other internet lines are shit. These plans that HughesNet sells all have data caps that run out surprisingly quickly. We upgraded our plans multiple times over the few months that we used them. With earnings coming out on 5/13, I expect HughesNet to have made quite a bit over the last two months in upgrades alone not taking into account the people that switch from their shitty provider to get slightly less shitty service through HughesNet. As we all know, internet usage is up by a lot so this is a reasonable thing to expect. Also, In 2021 SATS is launching another satellite, called Jupiter-3, which will allow them to offer higher download speeds. Overall they seem to be a stable company that isn't going away anytime soon. For more info about their cash on hand (which is quite a bit) and their debt, look at their 10-K from last quarter. This is a play that I plan to make.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow [this one is probably my favorite](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1blor/this_has_to_work/) for the time being. Hasbro (HAS) is expected to go up after earnings come out on 4/29. The OP of the original post lays it all out perfectly;\n\n* Everyone is sitting at home just trying to get their kids to leave them alone for five minutes. Go to Target and look at the toy aisle. Hasbro. Go look at board games. If they're not sold out, almost all the big boys are Hasbro (Monopoly, MTG, Clue, Sorry, etc). Too lazy to leave the house? Go on Amazon. Not only does Hasbro own the majority of the first few pages of results for toys and board games, they barely have any inventory left.\n\nThis stuff is sold out despite the supply chain being back up and running three weeks ago according to the CEO. Everyone is buying board games and their Hasbro gaming brands (all the board games) and Franchise brands (Monopoly, Magic: The Gathering, Nerf, etc.) make up quite a bit of their sales. With all of this stuff flying off the shelves, this is gonna be a good quarter for them. Now according to the OP, Mattel (MAT) is their closest competitor and they release earnings on 4/23. If they report higher earnings from this quarter then expect Hasbro to absolutely crush their earnings because they are much more diversified and just a larger company. They are sitting around 70 right now but I think 80-90 are decent strikes for at the earliest 5/1. I'm gonna go with the OP of the original post and say mid-may is best for expiry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, Yelp (YELP) is fucked. For a lot more in-depth look [check out this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1ltpo/yelp_the_sick_company_of_the_tech_industry/) but I\u2019ll get into it a bit here. The majority of their revenue comes from ads and that's not good when companies are worried about not going under instead of marketing their shit. They are laying off 1000 employees with another 1000 being furloughed. Pageviews have dropped between 64% and 83% across the board because no one is fucking going out. It's not rocket science. They have been in the process of dying for a long time and this virus is just going to expedite the process. Their next earnings call is 5/14 so that is when I would expect the biggest drop if not in the days before in anticipation of the drop. I know advocating for puts right now is scary. We all have PTSD from the fuckening a couple of weeks ago so I understand the hesitancy. I'm going to do more research and really see if this is a good idea as we approach earnings a month away. Still, this is definitely something to watch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's what I've got for you this time. Its a lot less when I only have two days especially when I have to wade through the chest-high shit river that is this Wallstreetbets. Good luck fuckers and tune in on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for more WSB DD Summaries!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; I was right assholes, Echostar goes up, Hasbro goes up, Yelp goes down, write more good DD.\n\nPlays; SATS calls for after 5/13, Hasbro calls 80-90 strike for 5/1 or after, Yelp puts (I know, scary) for after 5/14 maybe.\n\nPrevious WSB DD Summaries; [4/3-4/6](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fw4nmv/wsb_dd_summary_4346_i_hope_you_fucks_can_read/),[ 4/7-4/8](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxtpbi/summary_of_dd_from_4748_plays_and_tldr_included/), [4/9-4/13](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0nkrl/summary_of_dd_from_49413_insider_trading_oil/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDISCLAIMER; I am not personally advocating for any play that I add to this list. I merely go through a couple of days of posts and find what I think is competent DD.
