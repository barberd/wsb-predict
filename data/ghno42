{"id": "ghno42", "title": "Missed out on Shopify, Wix, Wayfair, and Etsy? Here's (relatively undervalued) $JD. Earnings play + longer-term play + unusually high options volume", "selftext": "**TLDR:**  \nJD will do well and is quite undervalued relative to its closest competitor, Pinduoduo. Analysts are predicting -0.13 EPS for the quarter. Seeing how well Shopify, Wayfair, Chegg, Spotify, etc have done relative to expectations, JD will likely exceed as well. Unusual volume of calls purchased on May 8th as well, potentially indicating some big money is betting on this as well.   \n\n\n**TLDR of TLDR:**  \nJD good. Buy call.   \n5/22 50c (less IV than 5/15)   \n\n\n**What is JD?**  \nIts a large online retail store primarily based in China. Its accessible through the WeChat app, which is China's largest messaging app and 3rd largest in the world behind Facebook messenger and Whatsapp.   \n\n\n**Why should I care?**  \nJD.com had 321 million annual active customer accounts in June of 2019 and in Q4 it had 362 million. I expect this number to hit 400 million or higher, especially with the spike in online purchasing in China during the covid crisis. For context, the entire population of the USA is 330 million. 90% of its purchases arrive same-day or next-day, outperforming both Pinduoduo and Alibaba in terms of logistics. Its earnings & revenues have grown YoY and it has **exceeded earning expectations for the past 3 quarters.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Comparison to Pinduoduo:**  \nAnother large e-commerce company in China is Pinduoduo (PDD). They have the 2nd most active users (\\~580 million) of any e-commerce company in China, apart from Alibaba. PDD has almost the same market cap as JD yet their revenues are vastly different. JD had sales revenue of $82 billion in 2019, yet PDD had only $4 billion. On top of this, PDD posted a net income of -1 billion, while JD had +1.75 billion. JD's user base has also been rapidly growing, however this is more relevant if you're thinking of LEAPS or just buying shares. JD also has 3x the net assets of PDD and also appears to have a better customer reputation and retention rate than both PDD and even Alibaba, as JD's delivery times are quick and they also heavily work on eliminating counterfeit items sold by merchants. JD outperforms PDD in essentially every way, apart from user count. Sure, user count is useful but if it doesn't translate into revenue, then what?   \nIn summary, **roughly equal market cap, yet JD has a much better balance sheet and growth rate**. PDD has routinely missed expectations, does not have a strong logistics network as it almost entirely uses 3rd parties, and is overly reliant on small merchants that were likely impacted during shutdowns. Please note that the numbers below are in renminbi.   \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[JD](https://preview.redd.it/vim0xb2wusx41.png?width=913&format=png&auto=webp&s=a345732d69bd265f1c3f8b84d4f0f47897499e1c)\n\n  \n\n\n[PDD](https://preview.redd.it/0fca3ss3vsx41.png?width=905&format=png&auto=webp&s=7de11dc960173e18adc52dfe86b10666ecd5b3ab)\n\n**Comparison to... Amazon?**  \nBefore you grill me, no I am not saying JD is equivalent to Amazon or will get there within a few months. I am saying that there are some similarities that poise JD for future growth. Just like Amazon, JD has its own warehouses and they sell directly to consumers. They also allow 3rd party sellers, they have their own logistics and distribution, cloud services, IoT (Volkswagan partnership), and grocery stores. Hell, they even have some dabblings in insurance and healthcare with a stake in Allianz and a subsidiary, JD Health. JD Health was recently in the news for its coronavirus rapid testing and ability to book an appointment on their app. These are more relevant if you want to buy longer-term calls or shares (wtf is a share? Some weird kind of call without worrying delta, theta, and vega fucking me?).   \n\n\n**What about the economic damage due to covid?**  \nChina is already showing signs of recovery for consumer confidence and purchasing. Furthermore, JD has livestreaming services. Livestreaming revenues in China are up [470%](https://www.scmp.com/tech/e-commerce/article/3083562/e-commerce-live-streaming-help-drive-recovery-chinas-retail-scene). Online sales are up 36%. Thus, for at least for Q1, I'm confident in JD's performance. If you're playing for earnings, then the longer term macro environment isn't as important. Yes, JD could address the global economic uncertainty and pull an Amazon type move during earnings, though I personally doubt that they would do so. This would only display weakness and perhaps allow their competitors PDD and BABA to use this against them. See Chinese recovery graphs below.   \n\n\n[Smallest change in consumer spending \\(apart from India\\)](https://preview.redd.it/xmtp58lnssx41.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=747d2ff993375f14d0fb2536e17791bc2228ae3b)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Beijing traffic already back to pre-covid levels](https://preview.redd.it/uvqv5x7wssx41.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d4792b6c643b6611a951a000635fede5f70db3a)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[V-shape recovery in property sales and car sales](https://preview.redd.it/3182wkkitsx41.png?width=844&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f031f15a248349ddeee29563551ca41bbd5011a)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n![img](xw66vh6pvsx41 \"App downloads during China's covid crisis - JD has grocery stores as well\n\")\n\n**What about Trump threatening tariffs again? What if this a Luckin Coffee situation?**  \nUnlikely to matter, JD's business is entirely within China and not dependent on trade. They're focused on the consumer demand and logistics side of things. They also work with domestic firms via their 3rd party sales. Even foreign companies such as [Walmart](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/09/jdcom-walmart-invest-500-million-in-chinese-company-dada-jd-daojia.html) rely on JD due to their influence within China. They also own a 12% stake of JD. Do you think Walmart would risk their money if this was anything like LK? JD also has [partnerships](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/01/24/jdcom-makes-big-partnerships-4-us-tech-companies.aspx) with Microsoft, Western Digital, Volkswagen, and HP. All of these partnerships are for domestic sales. JD is not importing or exporting anything in significant quantities. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Last Topic - Unusual Options Activity**\n\n[7\\/17 47c](https://preview.redd.it/0bdd54c24xx41.png?width=1267&format=png&auto=webp&s=46248a44d9b1825f727549a394708b105999ad7c)\n\n  \nIf you look at 7/17, there was a volume of \\~17500 for the 55c traded on May 8th. This is **50x the volume for this contract** (normal daily volume \\~350). Furthermore, there was a single order of 7500 placed at the end of the trading day for this specific contract. This is equivalent to 2.7 million USD. Looking at other strikes and expiration dates, this order is still unusually large.   \n\n\nThere were two other large orders from the same exchange placed within seconds of the first trade, listed below. Most trading days for the 6/19 41c contract have a volume of less than 100. Friday, May 8th had 14000, with these two near-simultaneous trades comprising half of this. Combined cost of these 3 orders is 7.6 million USD.   \n\n\nWere there any other comparable days to Friday's option trading? Yes, there was one. The second largest day for the 6/19 41c was on 03/31 with a volume of 10000. **The following two weeks after this large trade, the stock went up 18% from $40 to $47.3**. There were also large volumes for various 6/19 strikes +/- 3 days of 03/31 prior to JD's first run-up in April. This could be pure coincidence but its interesting to note.   \n\n\nEven disregarding these 3 large orders, Friday May 8th had record volume for most strikes across several expiration dates. Of course there's no way for me to know who placed these trades or why they were placed. Insider trading? Large hedge? Long call ladder? A fellow WSBer trying to post some epic gains porn?   \n\n\n[Large orders ](https://preview.redd.it/j9mwonsv9xx41.png?width=1293&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0943a6deba7dbd1c0d3d1eb54fb09be14d5eaa6)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \n**TLDR:**  \nJD will do well and is quite undervalued relative to its closest competitor, Pinduoduo.

This also gives some buffer in case there's any overall market drop this week that affects JD.   \nIf you are going to wait until the last minute to buy these, please be aware that JD has their earnings report before market open. In other words, buy before EOD 5/14.   \n\n\nFor longer-term calls:  \n9/18 50c  \n9/18 55c  \n9/18 60c  \n\n\nIf you really want to pull a boomer move, you can buy actual shares as well.", "created_utc": 1589204231.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghno42/missed_out_on_shopify_wix_wayfair_and_etsy_heres/", "is_self": true}
