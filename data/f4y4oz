But later I came up and used it anyway. \n\nAfter I was done with redtube, I bought BWA $40 3/20 for 0.08 cents. \n\nThey recently had a decent earnings report and announced a dividend. I believe they did this to attract buyers from mutual funds and other dumb slow money. It\u2019s a good choice for it too, P/E is low, and now a dividend. But those fund managers are slow AF. But I think they\u2019ll start making decisions in early March. Or I\u2019m a fat dumb-dumb.\n\nResistance is futile. \n\nI\u2019ve gotta go, my mom\u2019s other boyfriend is here.", "created_utc": 1581890712, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f4y4oz/borg_warner/", "is_self": true}
