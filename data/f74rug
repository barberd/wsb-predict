{"id": "f74rug", "title": "Green Brick Partners, Inc. (GRBK) Technical Analysis", "selftext": "Green Brick Partners, Inc. (GRBK) is presenting some interesting bullish formations on its chart. These formations combined with the overall market uptrend and good price momentum indicates an upcoming bullish run this year. \n\nFollowing are some bullish signs:\n\n**1.** **Long Base formation over multiple years**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xvhoyfqd07i41.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0b374794e7cfbefedbbc4e9987f23f45dc8ad0d\n\nThe weekly chart above shows sideways movement for about 4 years starting in 2016 and continuing up till January 2020. During this time the price swung 50% to a 100% between a high of $12.5 and a low of $6.57. A long base pattern with huge price swings is usually sign of a bullish move after breakout from the base pattern.\n\n**2.** **Strong Breakout**\n\nAs can be seen from the chart below the stock price came close to breaking the $12.5 resistance thrice but failed each time. These attempts occurred in July 2017, November 2017 and then June 2018. After this the stock fell towards the lower end of the base pattern and formed an inverse head and shoulder structure over the next year (I will elaborate on this later).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/21impn7g07i41.png?width=488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=608a20f93b232e0389fa31f528449fa7b2f7cebc\n\nThe failed break out attempts strengthened $12.5 resistance. This resistance was finally overcome in January 2020 when the stock price briefly surpassed $12.5. However, that was a false breakout as the price did not hold above $12.5 at close and it broke out on low volume.\n\nThe final breakout above the $12.5 resistance was yesterday (2/19/2020) when the stock decisively closed above $12.5 at $12.62. This breakout was accompanied with a spike in volume (see daily chart below). The price today 2/20/2020 continued to move higher, further confirming the breakout.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l8cgtycj07i41.png?width=371&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed3107b15665cd511c715156a62f68a3a0f5cfc6\n\n**3.** **Inverse Head and shoulder pattern.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qdxwqm4l07i41.png?width=343&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f597b29785947cfbe43df18da0ba9b3dcdce4663\n\nAs can be seen in image above the stock formed an inverse head and shoulder pattern and broke above the neckline in late 2019. This was the first indication of an upcoming bullish run while the stock was still within the $12.5 to $6.57 base. Subsequently the price moved rapidly up and finally broke above the $12.5 resistance on high volume.\n\nA strong breakout on high volume over a long formed base pattern indicates that GRBK is technically sound and is presenting a good buy opportunity.\n\nIn addition to technicals, GRBK\u2019s earnings have also been promising. Last 4 consecutive quarters\u2019 earnings reports have beaten the consensus estimates by at least 10% each. Green Brick Partners, Inc. (GRBK) is scheduled to announce 4th quarter 2019 earnings on 2nd March 2020.", "created_utc": 1582254259, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f74rug/green_brick_partners_inc_grbk_technical_analysis/", "is_self": true}
