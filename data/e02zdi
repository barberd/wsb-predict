I bet my kids Christmas present money on $DIS and $AMD calls and I\u2019m currently getting the shaft. I\u2019m putting Christmas in your hands guys, so if you could all put together the $50 dollars you have in your RH accounts and buy a share of AMD, or for you high rollers a share of DIS so my kids can enjoy their Christmas, I\u2019d appreciate it. Once my calls print maybe I can afford to subscribe to Disney+ for the kids and even splurge on one of those Ryzen processor things. Hell, next year I might even be able to get them a computer to go with the processor. \n\nThanks,\n\nSincerely Bull Gang", "created_utc": 1574438683, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e02zdi/not_sure_if_you_guys_got_my_fb_invite_for_bull/", "is_self": true}
