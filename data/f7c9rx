In addition, the sub has seen a rise in users resulting from media attention and r/all over the past few months. Recently, some pumpers have been able to leverage the size of this community to pump stocks. \n\n**The reason** u/closethefuckinglight **was banned:** \n\nFirst, though not a reason for the ban but an important fact, the user's post on $LL was his first on reddit although he had an account greater than 3 years of age. He used the platform for personal gain by moving markets. \n\nHere is how u/closethefuckinglight was able to move markets:\n\n* The user took a position on a highly shorted, small cap company ($LL has a short interest of 38%, $MIK at 49%)\n* The user posted DD on this sub on the name. Due to the low attention span of users, a post of greater than a paragraph was taken as genius thinking. Users and others that visit the forum then bought calls in large amounts (Call volume on $LL was 73x the 20d average; see: [https://imgur.com/a/iisk8fd](https://imgur.com/a/iisk8fd) taken at 1pm EST)\n   * Posting DD is a good thing. However, it was obvious this user had the intention of pumping. Inn the future, DD should be on stocks that are not penny stocks or small caps. \n      * To those that say this is no different than Citron posting a research piece, tough shit.\n* The large amount of call buying forces market makers to delta hedge their short delta positions by buying stock. When call buying is as widespread as it was yesterday, this causes moves (especially in the low float, penny stock names favored by the poster) \n* Naturally, this causes the underlying to rise and users (including the poster) profit. \n\n**Let's revisit a few rules now (specifically number 8):**\n\n* No penny stocks (stocks under &lt;$10 or market caps below $1bn); users who violate this, will be banned\n   * \"Ford is under $10 and it's not a penny stock\" \n      * \"Go take your shitty dividend and head to r/investing\"\n* No pumping. Period. \n\n**Other actionable items:**\n\n* Any posts or comments on $MIK will be banned. \n* Users seen commenting on posts of u/closethefuckinglight relating to markets in his personal subreddit will be permanently banned. \n\nr/wallstreetbets was created to allow users to discuss higher risk plays. Recent pumping is not in the spirit of this sub, is against the rules, and may be market manipulation.", "created_utc": 1582297250, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7c9rx/regarding_the_ban_of_uclosethefuckinglight_and/", "is_self": true}
