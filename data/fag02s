Saw the same option now priced 60 bucks(1200%+) \n\nSo I did what any sane person would do in this bear market. Opened call positions 1 day into expiry. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zlm0j1t09ij41.png?width=880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5234bdd4fa8570b16989453483ae375616f8a44e\n\nAll time: Fuck you Discover.
