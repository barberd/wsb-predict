Buy Snapchat ($SNAP).", "selftext": "Three days ago I made a post that said, \"Instagram's new Threads app was an insta-flop.\"\nYesterday, [Business Insider pointed out the same.](https://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-threads-app-sees-low-downloads-compared-to-igtv-boomerang-2019-10) \n\nSnapchat took a really hard hit because of the release of Threads. Now that it looks like Threads is a bigger disappointment than us, expect an analyst or two to increase their thoughts on Snapchat. This is Facebook's upteenth attempt to take Snapchat out of the running, but it looks like Snapchat is here to stay. It's like Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner. \n\nMoreover, Snapchat's stock price took another big hit recently when it was reported that they had server issues two days ago. Last time this happened it reached $17 (Average Analyst Price) after a few days. It now sits at $14.22. \n\nIt should also be noted that I've made about 5-6 DDs for this sub and they've all been correct so far.", "created_utc": 1570878557, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dgtrh7/instagrams_fb_new_threads_app_is_a_failure_buy/", "is_self": true}
