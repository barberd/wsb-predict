The ultimate DIS thesis is below.\n\n**Summary**\n\nDisney will fail miserably this year.  It is already failing in the most epic way, but it's just the beginning for us who were smart enough to \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b it.  There are great American stories about success out there. Disney's 2020 adventures will not be among them.  Disney's stock will reach the lows they haven't seen in years for the reasons provided below.  Yes, it's fun to short pathetic loser companies like SeaWorld and Six Flags, but do you have what it takes to watch the asshole Goliath like Disney get fucked AND get paid for watching?  Find out why and how.\n\n**Streaming**\n\nDisney has 30 million Disney+ subscribers and 30 million Hulu subscribers.  Based on those numbers, the revenue from streaming is $3.6 billion a year (out of Disney's $59 billion total revenue).  The profit is, however, much smaller.  The Mandalorian costs $15 million per episode to make, while The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, WandaVision and Hawkeye will run close to $25 million per episode.  All in all, the budget for making content for Disney+ is approximately $1 billion for 2020 alone.  Also subtract from 2020 revenue all the royalties they have lost by taking ALL their content off Netflix and other networks.\n\nThey have also spent billions on infrastructure and promotion of Disney+, so the best they were hoping for in 2020 was break even or maybe come in $0.5-1B ahead, which again, is very small.\n\nBottom line on streaming: it's tiny and is more of a liability than an asset when other divisions are crashing.\n\nSources:\n\n[Disney Over the Top: Bob Iger Bets the Company (and Hollywood's Future) on Streaming](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/bob-iger-bets-company-hollywood-s-future-streaming-1247663)\n\n\n[Disney is Spending a Ton of Money on Disney+, Including an Almost $1 Billion Original Content Budget](https://www.slashfilm.com/disney-plus-costs/)\n\n**Network TV**\n\nIt's a bad year for sports, and ESPN will suffer greatly.  Because of the broad decline in the economy, advertising budgets of ALL companies will shrink, and ABC will also suffer greatly.  Less money from the ads - less money for the mouse.\n\n\n**Box office**\n\nMGM recently moved 007 to November, but the assholes at Disney are pretending like Black Widow (due April 24) is not going to be moved.  Jesus Christ, of course it is.  New York is going to be on lockdown in a few days as will many other places.  There will be no fucking movie watching this spring.  They spent $200 million making Black Widow and expected it to make a billion.  That's a billion they are not going to have now.  But that's only part of the problem with Black Widow, the official launch movie of MCU Phase 4.\n\nBlack Widow is not 007, and Marvel is not MGM.  Marvel has no flexibility to move Black Widow because of the way they plan their lineup.  Moving Black Widow to November severely fucks with their budget and timeline for the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe.  Everything was riding on it, and they will now have to move releases AND production of upcoming MCU movies with established schedules out to 2021 and 2022.  That completely fucks their projected box office for those years.  It also fucks up their Disney+ lineup and affects the production of those shows.  And merchandise.  And a ton of other shit.\n\nMulan?  They fucking canceled it in Asia.  The movie they made for Asia.  Canceled in Asia.\n\nSources:\n\n[How Coronavirus Will Affect The Marvel Cinematic Universe](https://screenrant.com/marvel-mcu-movies-disney-plus-shows-coronavirus-delays-impact/)\n\n\n[Marvel Will Struggle To Delay Movies Because Of Coronavirus](https://screenrant.com/marvel-black-widow-coronavirus-no-delay-problem-reason/)\n\n**Parks**\n\nI am just going to save myself the energy and not bother writing about these retarded places where fat kids stuff their faces with ice cream and get fondled by characters, or vice versa.  The parks will be closed.  Paris, Orlando, and Anaheim.\n\n\n**Cruises**\n\nLol\n\n\n**Target price**\n\nYes, it has already dropped by a lot.  So fucking what, idiots?  Stop repeating the same dumb shit over and over.  DIS was $98 less than a year ago and $92 in 2016, and that was without a pandemic that cancelled their biggest movies and closed all their parks, and there was no massive recession.\n\nEven without closed parks and canceled movies, they already hit a $100.40 low in pre-market trading.  The 100p guys are practically in the money, but I don't care because I'm no 100p March 20 retard, no sir (more on that below).  \n\nWithout the parks closed and Black Widow cancelled, DIS already has already been dropping 1-1.5 percent more than total SPY drop on the bad days.  It's like the more extreme, crackhead version of SPY that's going down quickly.  Futures are currently down a full 5%, which means DIS will be firmly under $100 today, and that will lay down the groundwork for big, juicy drops for my April puts.\n\nSpecifically, I anticipate a $15 drop when the parks are closed and another $5-10 drop when Black Widow is cancelled.  I expect further drops as TV talking heads start spending time talking about how Disney is dropping and how no one would have expected that 6 months ago.  Jim Cramer will go from \"Buy Disney, it's cheap\" to \"Wow, I actually think that Disney is not going to do too well in the next two years.\"  That will tip boomer over the edge, and his weak hands will lead him to selling what he will have left of DIS at that time.\n\nTL;DR My Apr 17 $75 puts will be firmly in the money when all is said and done.  \n\n\n**Tendies (chart)**\n\nI have made a table of how the various tendies will print, depending on how far DIS drops.  Because each strike has its own IV, the outcomes are different.  I believe there is room for a drop to $50 and thus maximized the number of contracts.  But in any scenario, it will print.  The prices are still OK last time I checked despite the obviously high IV.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/LUrl0cQ.png\n\nYes, I know DIS will not go bankrupt, the $0.01 column is just for fun\n\nNote that these tendies do not include any time value.  If the events described above (parks, movies) happen in March, you will also be paid a cumload in premiums for your in-the-money puts that boomer's broker will be buying to hedge his long positions.\n\n**Positions**\n\n123 contracts total, most with TDA and some with Robinhood, just because I want to experience the thrill of my orders failing again.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/M4wYt2F.png\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/MkiUd2I.png\n\nYou can call this a YOLO play but to me it's a common-sense play, to bet against a company that makes money on movies, parks, cruises, and hotels in a year when there will be no movies, parks, cruises or hotels.\n\n***P. S.*** I do enjoy Disney animated movies and the Marvel movies even though they are cheesy as shit, but my overall feelings towards Disney as a company are overwhelmingly negative for making mockery of the copyright clause of the U.S. constitution and ruining copyright law for the entire 20th century by lobbying the fuck out of Congress to extend copyright terms until they became utterly ridiculous (which didn't stop the U.S. from pressuring the rest of the world to adopt them via mandatory WIPO membership for pretty much all countries).  I am looking forward to the tendies but I would not at all be upset if Disney got severely punished for being a completely amoral company and making so many asshole practices an industry norm.  \n\nSee you when this shit flips.", "created_utc": 1584008583.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhe6cb/heres_the_good_disney_thread_so_you_dont_have_to/", "is_self": true}
