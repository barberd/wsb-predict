{"id": "fp0isr", "title": "DD\\Discussion : The residential real estate market. REs, people who have used ibuyers (zillow, redfin), people in RE finance... IN.", "selftext": "This post was inspired by a shocking revelation doing some deep dives on residential RE and REITs.  \n\nFirst and foremost, there is a lack of people who can or will work the numbers here.  I do get a very \"this is very complex, but trust me, it'll never go tits up\" vibe to it.  You'll get a lot of really retarded REs that can only say things like \"2008 was an anomaly.\"  That statement means *nothing.*  What caused said anomaly?  How is the bubble different now? (consider case-shiller even adjusted for inflation in many areas now is as high or higher than 2008).  The *only* argument I could find was essentially *well it's supply and demand, and supply is low* along with \"too many unqualified buyers which led to mass foreclosures and sell offs.\"\n\nThis is true.  Also there were supply issues, as evident by these markets ( corroborated by huge declines in new homes built after 2008), but also countered with the fact that many markets started slowing down in late 19' early 20' with signs as far back as 18' that things were about tapped out.  Still supply issues, but seemingly started to become out of reach, overpricing, some market limitation that we'll only know truly in hindsight. \n\n**Okay so how is supply and demand?  What would you do if you had more data than anyone in the world to make that decision?**  \n\nI already knew that Zillow, Redfin other \"ibuyers\" were arbitraging the market, but I had no idea how much margin they needed to even do that shitty. Also I figured it was sort of an easy proposition because they can have agents inhouse on both sides of the transaction (limiting the impact of broker % to the seller's agent fee plus Zillow wages, also allowing them essentially vertically integrate this cost into their business model) and have ungodly amounts of data to work with.  They have market data and AI to decide buy prices, use an inhouse agent to buy and an inhouse agent to sell (or broker deals with institutional investors).  Do this in the greatest real estate market in recent history.  **Basically it can't go tits up.**\n\nImagine my shock when I see this is their buy margin and they still can't make money.  I assumed their inability to profit off of the arbitrage meaningfully was really an issue of scale (nope) and small margins... *I was wrong.*  I'm sure someone will hang me on \"well technically it is an issue of margins...\" YES *dickhead...*  But there is a finite limit to the degree you can profit (conversely, what you can buy at).  Adam Smith's invisible fist and all that.  \n\n> **No, it was not close at all. The zestimate was $660K, when I got my first offer it went down to $560K. Second offer was $545K before they cancelled it.**\n\nSo even with a ~15+% discount (which is enormous dealing with assets this size), they were losing money in the greatest time in residential real estate in modern history.  *With a stacked deck*.  Now this mirrors in my experience buying real estate in general to live in.  There's money to be made, but if you're looking for a nice place to live, you should be happy if it appreciates a bit and you more or less break even or make a few bucks.  House appreciates $35k, needs a roof, selling and closing costs blah blah blah and okay we lived in a nice place on interest.... *not bad.*\n\nSo **now we can speculate that ibuying is somewhat of an analog to homebuying.**\n\nNow having spent enough time in sales, I'm pretty damn sure I know how this went down.  When Redfin pulled the plug, Zillow saw this as an easy cherry picking opportunity.  But that says a lot in itself here.  It's not like Zillow just tightened up their game and started honing in on the cream and scaling back their team or anything like that, they see the writing on the wall and just said *nooooooooooope.*\n\n**now we can speculate that there is no \"deal\" right now that is worth the risk, if your goal is not to lose money in the short and medium term.**\n\nIt's not as simple as \"it's going down.\"  So what?  Rent isn't cheap and it doesn't increase your asset position like a mortgage.  You start out in the hole, but obviously you increase equity over time.  If you're competent at fixing your home and taking care of it, it's an enjoyable place to store cash, vs renting which is just an expense.  For some people it works better, we're not going there.  Regardless there is some rent expense vs discount axis here.\n\nSo here's some facts\n\n1. There is a liquidity crunch due to a large number of refinances bottlenecking loans right now.\n2. Non-QM is more or less off the table\n3. Supply&Demand Issue : Jumbo loans are becoming scarce to service.  It is supposedly one part supply and another part risk mitigation.  Need input from RE finance about big bank Jumbos (from what I understand are still in play, but rate boosted?)  Who on the ground has a perspective right now of Jumbo loan risk for well qualified?\n4. Demand Issue : On the ground DD about people's working conditions in \"unaffected\" (tech etc) markets seem to show there are a large number of layoffs happening, regardless.  Causing a decline in eligible homebuyers. \n5. Supply Issue : These are likely to manifest as many homesales, even if they never enter short sales etc.\n5. Supply Issue : Larger than normal numbers of deaths in older population is all but certain, resulting in a lot of properties entering the market over the next 18 months. \n6. Demand issue : I can't imagine the long term buyer psyche withering the next 2 peaks here, along with layoffs and everything else about catch up to us and saying \"you know what, let's buy a new car and house.\"  Recession and deflation. Fed is trying to carry us all the way through the Qs without anyone becoming self aware.  But how can people do that when they're already losing their jobs.  The bluff doesn't have the market there to support it.\n6. Debate : Let's say SPY never 160s.  Deflation most likely *at the very least*, interesting to hear any counter that deflation isn't likely.  \n7. Everyone seems to agree, the bottom is not going to fall out on residential.  Even a 30% decline would be somewhat unexpected.\n\nMisc speculation\n1. I do not buy the idea that banks will \"hold\" these houses.  Giant lenders like Chase?  Sure. But we're already seeing posts from people who are being serviced from places like Chase and have people holding the bag who *are not* willing to modify loan terms.  Debate : Can unlimited QE apply to this?\n\nMy position on residential is  15-25% drop over 6-9 months (non-coastal) after all this stuff catches up and there's a third SPY drop.  \n\ntl;dr : Residential RE to downgrade from DDs to a B cup and enter modest deflation after a correction shortly (6-9mo) after the 3rd SPY drop when reality starts to set in soon.  that you could have sworn was at least a C cup when she was wearing that outfit.  Ahh they look good on her anyways.\n\nToday I was told I work at Burger King from another user.  So I guess I'm looking for more fry chefs and an executive meat flipper to help wrap this up so that we can start taking positions ahead of market.\n\nCommercial RE positions are already on the news.  But residential is still being pumped, or \"it's going to V\" whatever.  People are literally still buying houses right now.\n\nSo let's start on the position and residential REITs.\n\nDING FRIES ARE DONE", "created_utc": 1585178250.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fp0isr/dddiscussion_the_residential_real_estate_market/", "is_self": true}
