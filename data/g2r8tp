{"id": "g2r8tp", "title": "Mind the gap...", "selftext": "Just my perspective but...SPY 3/6 daily close to 3/9 daily open is the last major gap down left from the current drop...around the 290 price range.  Don't be surprised if we fill that gap then SPY starts to rolls over.  A lot of the initial uncertainty that causes the massive fire sales in the first few weeks have been starting to resolve.  Specifically around when we re-open, who's getting bailouts, interest rates, oil, etc.\n\nThis would mean the market repriced about 15% from the highs.  This was likely the bigger hedge funds unwinding their risk and starting to price in the economic impacts.  Now we start the grind down as much of the optimism about the future becomes the reality of the situation.\n\nLet's see if things like PPP actually keep people employed, or how the stimulus checks get spent.  Let's see if people stop paying rent, or if restaurants now operate at half capacity.  There are a lot of questions still left to be answered about the economy, but some of the most chaotic outcomes seem to be answered.", "created_utc": 1587082943.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2r8tp/mind_the_gap/", "is_self": true}
