{"id": "g67bk1", "title": "Long Puts for Social Media Companies", "selftext": "So we all saw SNAP go to the fucking moon on their earnings yesterday which, aside from fucking me and my puts, was shocking- considering SNAP's business model is shit and they're only popular amongst the younger kids- who don't have much disposable income unless their parents credit cards are tied to their accounts. \n\nSo their DAUs boomed, which we all expect to be true across the board of social media companies (as the others are riding SNAPs coat tails today and all on the rise) because what the fuck else are us retards doing other than scrolling through instagram and adding hot girls in bikinis to our spank banks? But anyway, I digress.\n\nSocial media company's earnings are coming up and we can expect one thing- they'll fucking boom, because thats the way it goes, baby. But while Wall Street claims to be forward thinking and stock price is based on perceived future value, blah blah blah, it's clear they haven't thought about what's going to happen when we're all back out of our house and not glued to our phones with our dicks in our hands. \n\nSo, over the next few weeks as these companies report earnings and their stocks continue to pop together, long term puts are going on sale. If you think these social media companies can maintain their Q1 user growth, you're more retarded than I am and I bid you adieu. On top of that, a lot of SME businesses are going bankrupt and not advertising- this will hit Facebook harder than SNAP because, Boomers own those businesses and Boomers only advertise on Facebook. They're all going to suffer though as marketing budgets have already been slashed and it looks like most companies are stocking up for a massive holiday spend to regain losses from early this year because of the beer virus. \n\nDisclaimer- I have short term calls on these companies too and plan to double down on long puts once they pop off earnings. \n\nPositions below for you fucktards to ride my coat tails on these trades. \n\n$PINS $13p 8/21\n\n$SNAP $10p 7/17\n\n$TWTR $18p 9/18\n\n$FB $130p 9/18\n\nDD: my girlfriend does paid social advertising and explained this to me like the retard I am. Then she pegged me and called me a bitch. Win Win.", "created_utc": 1587582734.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g67bk1/long_puts_for_social_media_companies/", "is_self": true}
