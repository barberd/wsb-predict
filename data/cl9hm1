Anyone that goes to West Virginia is not up to any good and I don't want to be involved.\n\nAnyway he came back and brought with him mushrooms he picked from a cattle ranch. I'm quite fond of such delicacies so I indulged myself. I was home alone for a about an hour when everything got a bit strange. By the time I realized there was something odd about those mushrooms, The Ghost of Charles Ponzi appeared. \n\nHe sat down on my couch and quickly said \"I have something to show you, sit down\".\n\nI sit down, he tells Google to turn on the TV. He had to use the remote to turn on Netflix because Netflix doesn't communicate well with others. \n\nHe turns on a show and it's me on a small yacht reading a book on the deck.\n\nHe then handed me a paper and disappeared.\n\n\n    Netflix scammed the shit out of mother fuckers. This bitch is priced to grow at an impossible rate. Ironman coming for that ass.\n\n   NFLX 06/19/20 160 P\n   NFLX 06/19/20 135P\n   NFLX 03/20/20 160P\n                              \n                             Enjoy the Yacht\n                             CP", "created_utc": 1564777827, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cl9hm1/i_watched_nflx_with_the_ghost_of_charles_ponzi/", "is_self": true}
