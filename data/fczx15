{"id": "fczx15", "title": "PSTG - The Perfect Buy", "selftext": "Guys, there is a hidden play no one is particularly watching.  Pure Storage (PSTG) is priced right now at about $15.0X, but almost EVERY ANALYST thinks it should be in the low-mid 20s.  Their recently released quarterly report said they EXCEEDED revenue projections. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey were also started by secretive Silicon Valley VC firm Sutter Hill Ventures.  This firm\u2018s whole existence is to create companies to take public, Pure Storage was their first and their baby.  Look at Snowflake computing if you need some additional proof (going to IPO very shortly), along with many other companies.  PSTG is a hot database company which supplies the hardware that makes the whole fucking internet work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis shit is primed to take off, and an option call for them to be at $17.50 by late March is only $.13 (yes THIRTEEN) cents.", "created_utc": 1583263622, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fczx15/pstg_the_perfect_buy/", "is_self": true}
