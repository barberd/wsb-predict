It was baffling, as they crushed earning and locked in beautiful rates for the next 2 quarters but seemed to continue slipping. \n\nBut it seems like the perfect storm is brewing RIGHT NOW for our babies to TANK through next week for huge gainz.\n\nTankers seem to move inverse to oil, and with LA extending it's lockdown to AUGUST (surely many other cities will follow) and renewing tensions with China, oil looks primed for a drawback.\n \nAdditionally, we're approaching that time of month where oil futures holders start to panic and look to sell off their contracts (tankers have consistently begun uptrends around the middle of each month).\n\nIf all that isn't enough, most of these guys are trading at ridiculous discounts, near all time lows regardless of the literal all time greatest market they are enjoying right now. \n\nMy personal favorite, STNG, is trading at 50% of it's NAV. Also, the pretty lines on my screen made a nice pattern that says large green dildos incoming (triple bottom and subsequent breakout AH).\n\nTendie time?", "created_utc": 1589329820.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gio4jp/tanker_gang_3_the_last_dance/", "is_self": true}
