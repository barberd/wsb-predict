{"id": "eyyw0n", "title": "TSLA $1K Tomorrow (I repent)", "selftext": "As we already know, Tesla is going to break $1,000 tomorrow and a mass selloff will likely ensue, causing the price to plummet. I will unfortunately be selling all of my shares at $990 after holding since October and riding this cock-like parabola for the past four months as it undulates and grasps new ATH's like I grasp my cock when driving past schools. \nPapa Elon might never forgive me and my FOMO might stop me, but I want to realize these absolutely mental gains and put them into something less volatile. But what if Tesla isn't volatile and it's just linear @ $100/day? Fuck. Still, selling at $990 because of all the people planning on getting out at $1,000. While this might ignore the sacred doctrines and overlook the very foundation of this sub, I must recognize that I only have asperger's and can therefore sell without riding this rocket to Mars like my ass burger is telling me to. It's been a wild ride Elon, but I'm jumping off of this rocket before it plummets back to Earth. If you're staying on, may your testicles hold on tight and plant a flag of this post on Alpha-Cen if you make it.", "created_utc": 1580857152, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eyyw0n/tsla_1k_tomorrow_i_repent/", "is_self": true}
