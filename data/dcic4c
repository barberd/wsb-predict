{"id": "dcic4c", "title": "How to Short $HD", "selftext": "Ok fellow autists buckle up for this one its full proof, best short of 2019, even better than those raging autists at WeWork.  So I recently ordered a really nice washer and dryer set from the HD.  All in, cost me about $2k.  Since ya boi the Mango Man didnt nuke Dorian, my delivery got delayed.  Due to being a slave to my job because I YOLO every paycheck, I couldn't get the time off to be there for the delivery and the next delivery wouldn't be for another 2 weeks!  So I say fuck it, I need to wash the cummies off my waifu ASAP and I can't wait 2 weeks, so I cancel the order and go elsewhere and get my washer and dryer.  Here's the fucking catch boys.  These fucking thumb sucking retards use a third party delivery company to schedule all of their deliveries. The third party company can't issue refunds and their two systems don't talk to each other.  So I find out 2 weeks later that HD still has my money and they have to issue the refund in there system.  So here's the fucking plan.  We get every retard on this sub to order 10-15k in appliances on their sweet Amex Platty cards and other random shit about 2 weeks out from next earnings. Exec's will be so excited for earnings they'll be creaming their wives with that HD orange. YOLO some thicc calls, cancel that shit through their retarded friends, and let it ride through earnings. Fucking tendies boys, you're welcome.", "created_utc": 1570058108, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dcic4c/how_to_short_hd/", "is_self": true}
