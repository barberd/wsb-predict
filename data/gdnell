{"id": "gdnell", "title": "Why The United States Cannot Shut Down For A Second Wave Even Though It Will", "selftext": "During one of the coronavirus task force briefings, an admiral came up and detailed how he was getting ventilators into the system. Much of the press was outraged when he detailed it out because the government was using a middle man that was profiting off it. The admiral\u2019s response? \u201cMy job is not to invent a system. My job is to put volume in the system.\u201d\n\nSuch is the realities of leadership in a time of crisis.\n\nSo. When the Fed went into \u2018save everything mode,\u2019 they did so with a desire to unfreeze credit markets and make sure markets functioned. Powell\u2019s job was to put volume into the system.\n\nThat system now has volume. And plenty of it. Everyone is buying everyone else\u2019s debt. Disney wants five billion for a year? Wells Fargo says \u2018COUNT ME IN.\u2019 Boeing is issuing bonds? \u2018IT\u2019S A RAID,\u2019 says every person with access to debt markets. Delta can\u2019t fly 10% capacity this quarter. People buy their debt like it\u2019s the liftoff of the 747.\n\nSo the system now has ample volume going back and forth. Everyone\u2019s leveraged to the tits in new debt. What could possibly go wrong?\n\n30-50 million unemployed is what\u2019s wrong.\n\nAlready high household debt continues to skyrocket as new income falls off a cliff is what\u2019s wrong.\n\nReckless debt issuance and a borrowing system that never really reset after 2008-9 is what\u2019s wrong.\n\nIn what will likely go down as the dumbest FOMO among smart money of all time, every major institution has tried its best to get in on every company\u2019s debt offerings. But what happens if Delta sees just 30% of flying traffic in the third quarter? What if California and France refuse to open Disney\u2019s parks until early July and shut them down again in September as precaution? And would anyone really be surprised if Boeing doesn\u2019t get the 737 max off the ground until 2021?\n\nThese events have a decent probability of happening. And such companies as Delta and Boeing may not be able to service their debt at the end of 2020 if, say, we have to shut everything back down to prevent a second wave.\n\nNot every bond holder is going to get screwed. But the rate of defaults on loans is going to be much higher than the laughable estimates JPM and Well\u2019s have set cash aside for.\n\nLet\u2019s keep in mind: it wasn\u2019t the Fed\u2019s job to invent a new system. Its job was to keep the current system functioning.\n\nSo what is the system they\u2019re pumping? The debt system. And all they\u2019ve really done is re-inflate a debt bubble to a much bigger size than it was in February. And given the details released today by the Fed essentially announcing they'll be buying HYG and LQD, this bubble is growing to hindenburg-sized levels.\n\nWith people putting their rent on credit cards, our system is just surviving right now. But what happens in wave two?\n\nBoeing can\u2019t pay its coupon as Delta withdraws all orders so it can attempt to service debt too big to pay itself. An empire like Disney looks at risk for shuttering. Restaurants are seen as germ lands by the average consumer and nobody goes dining in for several years. Housing construction companies simply cannot survive the epic demand and supply destruction with defaults on mortgages skyrocketing as well. Fannie and Freddie make 2008 look like a prelude to the real story. And the Fed may have to try and get out of HYG as companies in the ETF fail and they have to preserve tax payer dollars as per their legal obligation, which will only further feed the negative feedback loop.\n\nAt Buffet\u2019s shareholder meeting saturday, he praised Powell\u2019s speed to get credit markets functioning again. On top of that, he said March was the highest bond issuance month of all time, followed by April breaking that record.\n\nBut here\u2019s what\u2019s interesting in what he said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the consequences of this will be.\u201d\n\nSo perhaps we are somehow able to punt the debt bubble pop down the road by allowing all loans to defer for extended periods. Perhaps the US government is able to find some way to write off certain types of debt in a last resort effort to avoid economic catastrophe. They will certainly get creative as everyone becomes desperate. But in all likelihood, these kinds of ideas are untenable without resulting in extreme damage to other segments of the economy.\n\nWe are on the brink of the debt bubble collapse. And given a second wave, we will create a negative feedback loop that will slump the United States Markets for years.\n\nI don't believe we will have a 10 year great depression. We learned so much from that time period and we will use that knowledge to recover faster, and maybe even better. But like the civil war, world war one, and world war two: everyone thought at the beginning of each outbreak it was only going to last a few months. We think the same thing now about this crisis.\n\nTL;DR: Often when you are operating in a paradigm you don\u2019t realize the flaw of that paradigm until you are forced to shift into a new paradigm. The debt bubble paradigm is about to shift, but not before it pops.", "created_utc": 1588637712.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gdnell/why_the_united_states_cannot_shut_down_for_a/", "is_self": true}
