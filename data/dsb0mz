After seeing people on the almighty wallstreetbets, wager a timid 50k or so on average with this new feature available, I thought it was only a clear choice to raise the average for the good of all. That's how I found myself long over $1.7M in AMD shares and selling around $1.6M worth of calls. I was leveraged over 500x which now makes a great argument against my Forex trading friends and the weak margin they offer there. Thanks for listening to my TEDTalk fellow autists. May some of you follow in the great footsteps of 1ronyman, analfarmer2, and controlthenarrative.", "created_utc": 1573013628, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dsb0mz/robinhood_has_inbred_and_made_the_ultimate_autist/", "is_self": true}
