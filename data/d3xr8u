The auction happened on September 15th and was expected to bring in at least $120 million over an evening and day sale, it grossed $200.75 million. Less than two weeks later the stock market crashed, starting the 2008 Recession.\n\nIf the market doesn't buy WeWork it's essentially saying \"we don't believe in tech companies who don't produce a profit\", which undermines 90% of tech companies the market has gone wild for. **The market will prop-up the price with a frenzy, and then crash shortly afterwards.**  \n\n\n**You can send me tendie money for this tip by cash in the mail**, non-sequential bills please.", "created_utc": 1568418855, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d3xr8u/wework_will_have_the_most_successful_ipo_ever_dd/", "is_self": true}
