We are onto something big here. I usually don't play pharma companies but Flexiron stood out to me as an opportunity with HUGE upside, so decided to share with you retards... Please let me know what you think (especially if you're trading healthcare stocks), but there seems to be some credible information on why this company might moon fairly soon.\n\nFlexion Therapeutics currently trades just over $10.00 a share and sports a market capitalization of approximately $380 million. **The company is up 2.4% today after an initiation of coverage by Guggenheim, which announced a massive 106% increase in its stock price for the upcoming quarter**.\n\nThe company was riding high late in 2019 when the FDA approved Zilretta, one of their core products. This was going to be the key catalyst for ramping up sales of the company's flagship compound as afflicted individuals could now easily be on scheduled injections to help alleviate chronic knee conditions.\n\nUnfortunately, the COVID-19 outbreak and the subsequent shutting down of most of the nation in an ill-considered countrywide virtual 'lockdown' had significant impacted Flexion Therapeutics and its plan to ramp up Zilretta, which was doing very nicely until this coronavirus blindsided the globe.\n\nHowever, as the country starts to reopen on a state by state basis, and non-COVID-19 doctor visits and procedures come back online, the prospects for Zilretta should be much better in the second half of the year. The company just addressed its funding needs by executing a secondary offering that raised some $75 million.\n\n**Balance Sheet:**\n\nThe company ended the first quarter with approximately $125 million in cash on hand. Adding in the recently raised $75 million, the cash balance is now up to some $200 million (roughly half of the concerns market cap), not counting an upfront $10 million payment for a new licensing deal (see below). This should push any additional funding needs well into 2021 or longer (depending on how fast Zilretta can ramp back up).\n\n**Over the past month, Flexion has been reiterated as a Buy or Outperform at four different analyst firms, including Northland Securities, Needham, and RBC Capital. Price targets proffered have ranged from $18 to $35 a share, which is 200% to 350% from today's price point.**\n\nFlexion should return to revenue growth starting in Q3, has solid analyst support and just addressed its funding needs. In April, the company announced an exclusive license agreement with a marketing partner to get Zilretta into the greater Chinese market. This agreement provided Flexion a $10 million upfront payment. The company can also earn just over $30 million in additional in aggregate development, regulatory and commercial sales milestone payments as well as royalties on further sales\n\nLast but not least, it is expected that the Phase 2 trial of Zilretta to treat OA of the shoulder will soon resume after normalcy returns to its business. Given the volatility of the market which has increased option premiums significantly, the best way to add exposure to Flexion is via a covered call strategy in my opinion.\n\n**Positions:**\n\nThe firm set its price target to $20 - not far off the Street low, but implying 106% upside from yesterday's close of $9.69. With that, Wall Street analysts are Very Bullish on the whole. I've taken a conservative position and played $12.5 with a 6/19 expiry.\n\nNote that Guggenheim 106% upside news just came out, so the hype is going to build up quickly for FLXN.
