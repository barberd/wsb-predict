Today is your chance.\n\n**2 (very straightforward) reasons why today is a good time to buy HPQ calls.**\n\n**1. Earnings are still a week away.** \n\nYeap, thats right. HPQ earnings are next Wednesday. Theres still some time to go before the hype dies down. But why today of all fucking days?\n\n**2. HPQ is testing a key resistance are right now**.\n\nRight now, they are testing a key resistance area (16.51 - 16.61). Its going to trade sideways for a while as it tests that area. The bull FOMO + earnings may push it past that resistance area where it will likely moon till the 18.1 - 18.2 resistance. Im guessing it might break this resistance level but reverse at the 18 level. \n\nOnce it breaks this resistance, you are gonna be finding it hard to get a good contract price as the prices are just gonna go up. Today is the day.\n\nI bought HPQ 15c 5/29 3 days ago. Right now, HPQ is testing that resistance. Get in while you can. And bail once it hits 18.", "created_utc": 1589907585.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gmshft/2_reasons_to_buy_hpq_calls_today/", "is_self": true}
