{"id": "ebx675", "title": "SOLY - tiny float tattoo removal magic box", "selftext": "SOLY is a small company headed up by some long time industry vets with tons of experience growing and selling companies. Specifically, \"aesthetic\" medical devices. SOLY has a Rapid Acoustic Pulse (RAP) device that dramatically reduces the time required for laser tattoo removal- sure to be a huge business in the years ahead as every millennial and gen-z realizes full sleeve tattoos are not a good idea.  It is already FDA approved for this and they have the patents they need to bring this thing to market. It is currently being trialed for secondary indications in both cellulite improvement and scar removal.  The device was developed with MD Anderson. They have MIT and Stanford alumn with huge resumes on their board and prior big sales in this \"aesthetic\" space to Allergan- this isn't a nonsense company. \n\nFunds have so far been raised through private placements at around $14/share, yet it currently trades below 12. The float is tiny and it has been trading \\*very\\* thin, meaning if/when it moves it is going to move huge. It popped into the mid 20s already twice when the FDA approval was received for tattoo removal, but quickly sold off for whatever reason. Over the last 6 months it has essentially been forgotten about and frequently trades \\~100k shares in a day (no volume!). Do your own DD, the company has done multiple presentations on both tattoo removal as well as the earlier stage cellulite and all indications are very good. You can literally move this thing with a $10k market order right now, when attention turns to it via stocktwits or whatever it is really going to pop. Godspeed\n\n [https://ir.soliton.com/](https://ir.soliton.com/)", "created_utc": 1576596322, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ebx675/soly_tiny_float_tattoo_removal_magic_box/", "is_self": true}
