Spoiler, they don't give two fucks about you and not doing this for charity.\n\nThe catch is that before their 3rd world Fiverr slave publishes the article on autist's site, they have to proofread the fucker and make sure everything looks good, is in English with porn all porn removed from image place holders.\n\nThere is something called sitemap.xml for example (read between the lines  \ud83d\udd95 )lemonjuiceresearch.com/sitemap.xml, in this map you may occasionally find an easter egg like for example the said slave's draft a day or two prior. **Before the news drops.**\n\nThere other tricks and other sites which will probably be promptly addressed by professional trolls after I post this, don't make your shit public assholes.\n\nEnjoy your free tendies. Stay gay and within your legal masked IP on a disposable laptop using a Starfucks wifi, my fellow autists!", "created_utc": 1578640554, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/emnjfr/front_run_the_other_autists/", "is_self": true}
