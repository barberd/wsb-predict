{"id": "e5mtxf", "title": "Options market 12/3/19", "selftext": "Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research\n\nToday\u2019s Bullish Activity\nGapping up to all-time highs this morning is Axsome Therapeutics Inc. (AXSM + $7.68 to $47.30) after the clinical stage biopharmaceutical company said that its experimental narcolepsy drug (AXS-12) achieved the main goal of reducing cataplexy attacks in a mid-stage trial. No serious side effects were reported and the drug met its secondary goals of reducing excessive sleeping and improving brain function. Calls are outnumbering puts roughly 3:1 with the March 2020 30.00 call topping the most actives list (volume is 510).\n\nAlso gapping up this morning is Audentes Therapeutics Inc. (BOLD + $30.19 to $58.80) following news that Astellas Pharma Inc. (ALPMY $17.08) has entered into a definitive agreement to buy the gene therapy developer for roughly $3B or $60.00/share in cash. BOLD puts are outnumbering calls better than 5:1 which is primarily being driven by activity on the February 2020 40.00 put (volume is 1,549). Other gene therapy names moving higher in sympathy with Audentes include: Uniqure NV (QURE + $9.22 to $64.00), Regenxbio Inc. (RGNX + $2.62 to $43.30), Ultragenyx Pharma Inc. (RARE + $1.24 to $40.38), Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT + $2.17 to $110.96).  \n\nLastly, shares of Roku Inc. (ROKU + $6.20 to $142.28) are recovering from yesterday\u2019s ~15% drop (on a Morgan Stanley downgrade) this morning after Needham raised their price target to a \u201cStreet-high\u201d price target of $200.00 (from $150.00) and maintained their \u201cBuy\u201d rating. Needham analyst Laura Martin said that she believes ROKU is a \u201ckey beneficiary\u201d of the shift towards streaming video and should be valued as an internet aggregator, similar to YouTube in the video space. Calls are outpacing puts roughly 5:2 with the December 6th 145.00 call seeing the most action from traders (volume is 5,429).\n\n \n\nNew 52-week highs (26 new highs today): Constellation Pharmaceuticals Inc. (CNST + $0.61 to $45.46), Galapagos NV (GLPG + $5.01 to $200.40), Lamb Weston Holdings Inc. (LW + $0.61 to $84.64), PTC Therapeutics Inc. (PTCT + $0.85 to $48.46), Sony Corp. (SNE + $0.93 to $64.21)\n\nNotable Call Activity\nSome unusual call activity (~14:1 over puts) is being seen in Comcast Corp. (CMCSA + $0.02 to $43.66) as option traders primarily target the December 20th 44.00 call. Volume on this contract is 23,879 versus open interest of 3,971, so we know that this primarily represents new positioning. The bulk of the activity on this contract consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought for between $0.48-0.51 each, including a 7,100 block that was bought at the ask price of $0.49, which suggests bullish intent.  \n\nChewy Inc. (CHWY + $0.40 to $24.23): Calls are outpacing puts better than 5:1 which is mostly being driven by activity on the December 20th 24.00 call. Volume on this contract is 6,329 (vs. open interest of 3,568) which mostly consisted of a 2,500 block that was bought at the ask price of $1.50 and (a little later) a 2,500 block that was bought at the ask price of $1.60 (both suggesting bullish intent). The positioning comes ahead of the company\u2019s Q3 earnings report which is scheduled to be released next Monday (December 9th) after the market close.\n\nToday\u2019s Bearish Activity \nLeading the percentage decliners list this morning is Cara Therapeutics Inc. (CARA - $7.31 to $18.57) after the drug developer reported mixed results from a mid-stage study of its treatment for pruritus (itchy skin in kidney disease patients). The treatment reduced itching along a scale known as WI-NRS by 4.4 points (vs. 3.3 in the placebo group), meeting the main goal of the study, but the difference in the proportion of patients who had a greater than 3 point reduction in itching scores was not statistically significant. Puts are outnumbering calls roughly 2:1 with the December 20th 17.50 put topping the most actives list (volume is 2,121).\n\nAlso trading to the downside is Coupa Software Inc. (COUP - $9.77 to $139.17) even though the cloud-based business spend management platform beat quarterly earnings estimates and provided better-than-expected guidance last night after the market close. For the third quarter the company reported earnings of $0.20 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.14 beat and above prior guidance of $0.05-0.08) on revenue that increased 50.9% year-over-year to $101.78M and guided Q4 EPS to a range of $0.03-0.06 on revenue of $101.5-102.5M (vs. the respective ($0.02) and $99.50M consensus estimates). Puts are outpacing calls nearly 2:1 with the December 20th 20.00 put topping the most actives list (volume is 7,111). \n\n \n\nNew 52-week lows (75 new lows today): Alarm.com Inc. (ALRM - $0.08 to $41.89), Apache Corp. (APA - $1.09 to $18.45), Corecivic Inc. (CXW + $0.11 to $15.03), Netgear Inc. (NTGR - $0.15 to $24.29), Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP - $0.16 to $50.51)\n\nNotable Put Activity\nSome unusual put activity (nearly 30:1 over calls) is being seen in Phillips 66 Inc. (PSX - $1.37 to $112.96) which is primarily being driven by activity on the January 10th 2020 121.00 put. Volume on this contract is 11,202 (vs. open interest of 0) which nearly entirely consisted of an 11.2K block that was bought at the ask price of $8.60. We know this block is a new position given the open interest figure and we can assume the intent is bearish in nature since the trade took place at the ask price.\n\nSPDR Select Sector Materials ETF (XLB - $0.53 to $58.91): Puts are outpacing calls better than 6:1 which is primarily being driven by a 5K block that was sold on the January 2020 57.00 put for $0.83 when the bid/ask spread was $0.82 x $0.87 (open interest is 3,570). We know this block is a new position given the open interest figure and we can assume that the block trader believes that XLB will remain at or above the $57.00 price level or is comfortable taking a long 500K share position in this ETF at an effective purchase price of $56.17 in the even that it closes below $57.00 at expiration.\n\niShares IBOXX High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG - $0.22 to $86.32): Puts are outpacing calls roughly 50:1 with the December 27th 85.50 put topping the most actives list. Volume is 10,000 (vs. open interest of 203) which entirely consisted of a 10K block that was bought at the ask price of $0.38 (suggesting bearish intent).\n\nVolume Signals     \nBP PLC (BP - $0.40 to $36.91): A couple of large blocks were seen simultaneously trading out on the April 2020 expiration earlier this morning:\n\n39.00 call (open interest is 3,507): a 6,500 block was bought for $0.77 when the bid/ask spread was $0.63 x $0.78\n43.00 call (open interest is 2,075): a 6,500 block was sold at the bid price of $0.13\nWe know these blocks are new positions based on the open interest figures and it appears that a $4.00-wide bull call spread was established for a net debit of $0.64 (x 6,500 contracts x 100 multiplier, excluding commissions) which suggests that the block trader sees BP closing above the break-even price of $39.64 at expiration.\n\nSchlumberger Ltd. (SLB - $0.58 to $35.28): A couple of large blocks were seen simultaneously trading out on the February 2020 expiration earlier this morning:\n\n37.50 call (open interest is 4,764): a 7,260 block was bought at the ask price of $1.27\n42.50 call (open interest is 2,585): a 7,260 block was sold for $0.31\nWe know these blocks are new positions based on the open interest figures and it appears that a $5.00-wide bull call spread was established for a net debit of $0.96 (x 7,260 contracts x 100 multiplier, excluding commissions) which suggests that the block trader believes SLB will close above the break-even price of $38.46 at expiration.\n\nGauging Volatility\nThe CBOE Volatility Index (VIX + 1.41 to 16.33) is trading higher for the third day in a row and at a two-month high (intraday range is 14.61-17.98) as equity markets are firmly lower across the board around the mid-day mark today (DJI - 385, SPX - 31, COMPX - 107). VIX option volume has been average today at 299,922 contracts (#5 on the top 10 most actives list) and the activity has been slightly put-biased (the volume put/call ratio is currently 1.08). The most actively traded contract is the December 18th 13.00 put as volume is 45,410 versus open interest of 268,357.", "created_utc": 1575403892, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e5mtxf/options_market_12319/", "is_self": true}
