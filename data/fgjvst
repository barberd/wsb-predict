The President's Working Group on Financial Markets -- which we last heard from during the deep selloff at the end of 2018 -- held a call today to discuss markets, Treasury says.\n\nUnbelievable how many people do not know about PPT, here is some copy pasta:\n\nPlunge Protection Team\" (PPT) is a\u00a0colloquial name given to the Working Group on Financial Markets. Created in 1988 to provide financial and economic recommendations to the U.S. President during turbulent market times, this group is headed by the Secretary of the Treasury; other members include the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the [Federal Reserve](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalreservebank.asp), the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission\u00a0and the Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (or the aides or officials they designate to represent them).\n\nIn March 1988, in the wake of the\u00a0[stock market crash of 1987,](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock-market-crash-1987.asp) then-President Ronald Reagan created by executive order the President\u2019s Working Group on Financial Markets. The concept was to create an [informed, but informal, advisory group](https://www.loc.gov/item/fr053055/) on the markets for the president and regulators. Charged with \"enhancing the integrity, efficiency, orderliness, and competitiveness of our Nation's financial markets and maintaining investor confidence.\"\n\nOn Monday, February 5, 2018, the [Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dow-jones-total-market-index.asp) experienced a drop that was twice as large as its biggest point decline in history. However, arbitrary and aggressive buying cut the decline in half in one day. On Tuesday and Wednesday of that week, stocks opened lower, and each time aggressive buying buoyed the markets. That aggressive buying, some say, was being orchestrated by the Plunge Protection Team.\n\nOr, to take a more recent example: The Plunge Protection Team's aforementioned teleconference on Dec. 24, 2018. That whole month, the S&P 500 had been heading towards a record decline\u2014the motive for the team's meeting\u2014and the DJIA dropped 650 on the 24th alone. But when trading resumed after Christmas, the DJIA rallied over 1,000 points. On the 27th, it lost half those gains, until a late-day reversal stopped the slide, and caused the market to close 600 points up. That's no coincidence, conspiracy theorists argue.\n\nIf true, this sort of manipulation is not unlike the actions of consortia of [private bankers](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/wealth-management/021716/private-banker-job-description-average-salary.asp) and financiers in the late 19th and early 20th century who, during financial panics, would step in to shore up the stock market with massive purchases. The difference, of course, is that the Working Group on Financial Markets is composed of U.S. government officials, and the U.S. is supposed to operate on a free-market system. And also an open one, not one influenced by mysterious forces.", "created_utc": 1583870046.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fgjvst/plunge_protection_team_is_back/", "is_self": true}
