{"id": "exds0u", "title": "God Tier Theta Gang", "selftext": "As a precursor I will say this: If you are not very experienced with the fundamentals of options pricing theory, DO NOT DO THIS. Please, take some time, and learn about the theory, the application and objectives of what I am about to explain. There is a lot of content in this post and it is not simple, but it is incredibly profitable if done correctly. This is the ultimate guide, on how to Be Theta Gang. This is not a Theta soldier, Theta Captain, or even Theta General level strategy. This\u2026 Is the Theta God strategy, and currently it is used against you to steal your tendies every single day.  \n\n\n**Part 1: The Market Maker**  \n\n\nWhen you buy an FD, who do you buy it from? Perhaps a common theta enlistee in the WSBs rabble?  Why do you buy FDs? To gamble? Fair enough, to each their own, but what about institutional investors? Who are they buying options from? Why are they buying options? You need to think about this question and ask yourself \u201cAm I autistic enough to bring home the Tendies\u201d If you are, then the answers you are looking for revolves around the common enemy of WSBs. The Market Maker.  \n   \n\n\nMarket makers come in all shapes and sizes, but the most notoriously profitable version of the group is the \u201cnon-linear derivative\u201d market maker. They sell options to other people who buy options. Retail investors in particular are TERRIBLE at pricing these options, and the spreads between the market value and the \u201cfair value\u201d can often be large. For the average retail investor this is a problem, but for some, this becomes their advantage. In fact, even institutional investors such as pension funds, hedge funds, fixed income traders, and insurance companies struggle to get a \u201cgood price\u201d when they purchase an option. But because their goals are to produce the best *risk adjusted* returns, not net returns, they are practically forced to purchase these options in some cases. If everyone is buying options, then there is an increased demand and an undersupply of options. This is where the MMs come in.  \n\n\n**Part 2: Delta Hedging Theta Capture**  \n\n\nTheta is how much the value of an option declines over a set scale of time. Theta Gang wishes to *always* keep their Theta positive, in an effort to extract the time value of an option. Delta is the change in an options value over a set scale of prices. Generally, Delta works against Theta gang, but here it will be used to empower them. One example of a risk defined option strategy is the iron condor. The iron condor is dog shit.  \n\n\nTheta capture with attached dynamic delta hedging strategies are advanced options strategies that MMs and sophisticated market participants use to reduce risk from moves in the underlying, while profiting from the collection of Theta. As with all strategies there is still risk and this is in fact *NOT* \"Free money\". It simply transfers your risk in delta movements to other Greeks and risks by keeping your position delta neutral via the constant buying and selling of shares to offset movements in the delta of your short-sold option contract. Dynamic delta hedging is the constant update of this process and is generally aided by advanced computer algorithms and models. Statically attached delta hedges that capture Theta are more of a \"set and forget\" version of the same strategy.  \n\n\nIron condors are garbage because the decay eats into profits too much. An exercise of a leg against you sets you back, this is a fact. Statistically speaking you need to have the lowest rate of decay possible to be profitable and iron condors don't provide that to you, selling naked does in some cases though. The problem is you have to be able to take multiple hits in a row, and have very deep pockets to prevent max drawdown from wiping you out, at which point, looking at your reward as a % of what kind of capital you need, you might as well just invest the traditional way in a basket of equities and get a better yield. The only case this is not true is when you have a superior derivative pricing model compared to the options buyers and sellers you are going against, i.e., professional grade trade desks. This leaves dynamic delta hedging strategies which are IMO, the ONLY delta neutral strategies that have better risk reward than simply putting your money into an index at this point in time. Again though, you need very deep pockets to start and an ability to work statistical and pricing models. The significant advantage of dynamic delta hedging is that it is not range bound. It *does not* matter whether the equities price action deviates outside of its probabilistic curve, and you do not need to make any predictions about future equity prices because of this. This is how options MMs make their take.  \n\n\nYou may be saying: \u201cIron condors are garbage because the decay eats into profits too much, but that is the tradeoff of a risk defined trade. Sure, selling short straddles would make more credit but at significantly more risk when markets move quickly.\u201d You are wrong. If you play the Iron condor infinitely, eventually you will lose all of your money.  \n\n\nIf you run a random iron condor strategy simulation 100,000 iterations over, the simulation will have you coming out with a net loss every. Single. Time. Each individual trade may be risk defined, but the strategy is unprofitable unless you somehow make a proper prediction about future stock prices to at least some minuscule degree. I have noticed that the vast majority of you are terrible at predicting future stock prices. Like even worse than 50/50 on over under odds.  \n\n\nDynamically delta hedged positions are price indiscriminate strategies. You do not have to make any prediction about the future price action. You must either have pricing power in the market, or make a prediction on volatility, which is inherently easier because you do not need to specifically price forecast like you would for an equity price.  \n\n\nYou can either be short the contracts, or long the contracts. Either situation you can dynamically delta hedge, and be net negative gamma, or net positive gamma. Whichever one you decide will determine whether each update to your delta hedge loses, or nets you a return respectively. In either case you do not care where the underlying price goes.  \n\n\nRunning a random dynamic delta hedged strategy 100,000 iterations over would also leave you at a net loss, just as the iron condor strategy does. This is the principle of options. Derivatives markets are a martingale game. If you had an infinite supply of money and ran the simulation an infinite number of times instead of 100,000 you would wind up with 0 profit, and 0 loss, but within that infinite, or 10,000 or 20,000 or whatever number of iterations you decide, there will be times when you dip below your max drawdown if you did not have an infinite supply of money. This is the when you go bust.  \n\n\nSo which strategy is better if they both wind up with 0 profit and 0 loss? In an ideal world? Neither. But we do not live in an ideal world where equity prices are always perfectly modeled, and all market participants act rationally. Just as the physicist does not live on a frictionless plane investors and traders too, must deal with the nuances of equity markets. The good news is these \"imperfections\" if you will almost always favor dynamic delta hedging strategies because that is the strategy MMs use. The pricing is based off of the strategies they use to complete transactions in markets, and so the price is more often than 1/2 of the time, skewed ever so slightly into their direction.  \n\n\nGiving just a slight 0.000001% edge in either direction of the modeling of prices, puts the odds of profit in MMs favor and yours as well if you use the same strategies. Institutions are willing to deal with this because they recognize that this is the price of hedging risks, i.e., if they want to purchase the option, this is ultimately the price they pay. It is not the cost of the contract; it is the 0.000001% pricing skew that they are ultimately overpaying up for.  \n\n\n**Part 3: The Example**  \n\n\nBecause most of you lack the tools to infinitely buy and sell shares as the delta fluctuates, much as all market participants do, it is important to decide where you will be rebalancing your hedges. Consider the following example:  \n   \n\n\nStock XYZ trades at $50 today and you sell both a call and a put with 15 DTE. The put is a $45 strike, and the call, is a $55 strike. At the exact moment you sell both of these contracts, you will be delta neutral until the stock price changes. Once the stock price either increases or decreases by 1 penny, your delta will fluctuate ever so slightly. Suggest in this instance the price went up from $50, to $51 and the delta of the contracts increased by a net of +10 (This is hypothetical and only for illustration purposes). You are now short 10 delta. If at this moment you buy 10 shares, you are now delta neutral once again, meaning once again, you are capturing, only the time value of the option.  \n   \n\n\nIn theory, an ATM option will carry a delta of 0.5, meaning that as your short-sold call option goes from OTM to ITM, you should purchase 50 shares per contract sold short. Note that in this example you are collecting time value from both the call and the put you sold, and are hedged for price movement on the contract that is most probable to be exercised against you.  \n   \n\n\nIf you were to only sell the call and put naked, you would need the underlying price to settle between both of your short sold contracts strike prices plus a buffer, equal to that of the premium received. If however, the underlying asset moves outside of this range, you are now taking a loss on this trade. In theory with Dynamic Delta hedging, the price of the underlying can move infinitely outside of these expected bounds, and you will still profit. In the real world it is however a bit more complicated.  \n   \n\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, we will construct an example in which for every time you rebalance your delta you lose $0.05 per share due to market inefficiencies and an inability to always fill 1:1 with your delta exposure. In this case you are filling 0.95:1, an imperfect balance. How many times would you be able to rebalance before you exhausted all of the profit from your premium collected through time value? This is how an MM thinks about Vega. This is essentially how Vega effects options pricing and how it factors into options pricing models. It is the probability of how many times the delta will have to be re-hedged in order to remain neutral, compared to the premium received for the short sale of your contracts. The Black and Scholes model states this precisely. This is where the cost of an option actually comes from**. It is the cost, it takes, to dynamically hedge your position until expiration**. Black and Scholes did not account for changes in volatility from the time the option was written to the time it expired, however. this is both a risk, and an opportunity.  \n\n\n**Part 4: the \u2018Ol Flip-A-Roo**  \n\n\nIf you are short contracts and dynamically delta hedge, you are short gamma. Every re-balancing you make will work against you. This means that you need to collect more time value than you lose in rebalancing costs over the duration of the trade.  \n\n\nNow flip the situation. Buy an ATM put and an ATM call. Suggesting you purchase both at the $50 strike price, for every rebalancing you do to become delta neutral again, you will make the difference in market inefficiency. In this case your filling at 1:0.95 you are now betting that your net gain from rebalancing your delta hedges will outweigh the time decay of your long options. In this situation you have all of the same benefits as the first situation, but you are betting on rising volatility.  \n\n\n**Part 5: Conclusion**  \n\n\nOverall this strategy is incredibly useful because it grants you features that no other Theta Gang strategy does.  \n   \n\n\n1) You need significantly less price forecasting and predicative powers to make a profit compared to all other theta strategies. In fact, there is no price bound ranges, the stock price could go theoretically in either infinite direction and you would still be risk defined.  \n\n\n2) This strategy is not just risk defined, but depending on your rebalancing intervals, you can directly lessen or increase the amount of risk this trade has. In addition, it has dynamic risk evaluation, meaning at any point you can increase or decrease it, not just at the times you open and close the trade which is generally the case in static risk management trades. This means you can fine tune your risk as precisely as you want.  \n\n\n3) There is less need to worry about assignment risk because you will always be net the majority of the shares, whether it be long or short, needed to cover it in the event that you are assigned  \n\n\n4) Profits can be taken at any time. As long as you have thus far collected more time value than you have paid in re-hedging costs when you are net short gamma, or vice versa for long gamma, you are golden.  \n\n\n5) You have a vastly increased power in making spreads work for you. Just like an MM, the wider the spread the wider the profit because the buyer of your options will have to meet you at that mark.  \n\n\n6) If a strong trend establishes itself during the period of the trades duration, you can buy back your contract to close rather than have it be assigned to you, then you can keep your shares and let them ride in the defined trend they have set, you already will be short or long the shares in the correct direction. You can even incorporate this into your regular plan so that you scalp the shares shortly after the close of the trade to add even further to your profits.  \n\n\n7) You can use the same principles of this trade to be either short, or long Vega, you get to decide whether options are under, or overpriced, based on your ideas and the market conditions presently at hand.  \n\n\n8) And finally, this has a much better proven back testing success rate than other options strategies.  \n\n\nMake sure you practice with this strategy through paper trading, or other means. If you are handy with algos this is a great process to be automated, if not then consider how often you will be re-adjusting your hedges and under what conditions and play accordingly. If you have any questions, please let me know. Additionally I may have made some mistakes. This post is not retard friendly but it does outline an effective way for Theta Gang to start profiting again. Without more risk adverse strategies, particularly ones allowing the trader to make moves focused around vol, Theta Gang will be wiped out this year. 2020, is the year of the return to volatility. This was 6 pages long in MS word and I've read over it so many times that the words blend together and so I may have missed mistakes. Please correct me if any information is wrong.
