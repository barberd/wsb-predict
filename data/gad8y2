{"id": "gad8y2", "title": "Gilead play - Update 2", "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI\u2019m back to discuss Gilead in advance of the announcement this evening. \n\nIn my first post, I outlined why I am bearish despite the fact that the treatment might work. In my second post, I explained how the placebo-controlled phase 3 trial trial in China made me question whether the treatment will even work to begin with.\n\nI am back to discuss the results posted today, and the potential for tonight.\n\nGilead announced the results of their *uncontrolled* phase 3 study looking at 2 doses today (https://www.gilead.com/news-and-press/press-room/press-releases/2020/4/gilead-announces-results-from-phase-3-trial-of-investigational-antiviral-remdesivir-in-patients-with-severe-covid-19). In this study, both 5- and 10-day treatments saw 50 percent of patients improve at 10 days of treatment. Gilead is arguing this means that you can use the shorter treatment course which will be easier and cheaper to administer, since the drug has to be given daily by IV in a hospital. \n\nWhat I worry this actually means is that neither treatment had an effect. The patients took the drug for 5 days and only 50% recovered in 10 days. That means the 5 days that patients were not on drug had the same effect as 5 days they were. If not taking a drug is just as effective as taking one, it\u2019s hard to justify paying for the drug. The alternative view is that 5 days of treatment slowed the virus so much that it altered the course of the disease enough to buy time for the body to heal itself. This is plausible, but not convincing.\n\nThe real deciding factor will be the report from the NIAID, which will come out tonight and Gilead claims met its primary endpoint, which is time to clinical improvement vs placebo (https://www.gilead.com/news-and-press/press-room/press-releases/2020/4/gilead-sciences-statement-on-positive-data-emerging-from-national-institute-of-allergy-and-infectious-diseases-study-of-investigational-antiviral-rem).\n\nMy worry here is that the trial will barely meet the primary endpoint, meaning that the results are statistically but not clinically significant (aka 0 doctors will use it), or it hit the primary but safety concerns are substantial.\n\nI say the second point because the release from Gilead today was brilliantly timed to overshadow the published negative results of the Placebo-controlled trial in China in the extremely prestigious journal the Lancet (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31022-9/fulltext). If you\u2019re still arguing that the trial can\u2019t be trusted because it was done in China, I want to ensure you that the Lancet is extremely rigorous in these regards and it is highly unlikely that these data are inaccurate.\n\nAdd to this everything we already knew about remdesivir\u2019s chances at bringing in profit even if successful, and I am going to buy more puts just before close today. \n\nI do think there is a case for short-term bullishness, if the press release is positive, which you can bet Donny will be going for at the announcement, then there could be a short term pump. But what happens a lot in biotech stocks is buying the rumor and selling the news, so I\u2019d be careful of that too. (Once again, this is not financial advice).\n\nTL;DR - GILD 60p 6/19 and I\u2019ll probably add some 70p at the same expiry around 3-4pm today.\n\n**Edit:** thanks to /u/Owlboyo for sharing the CNBC article (https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/29/dr-anthony-fauci-says-data-from-remdesivir-coronavirus-drug-trial-shows-quite-good-news.html). Dr. Fauci is the Director of the NIAID, so he basically pre-announced the data, I guess. Not sure why he\u2019d do that. It could be that the full report will cast some doubt on the numbers he\u2019s highlighted, or raise safety concerns, but honestly if this is the data then a short-term GILD pump seems highly likely. I am holding my 6/29ps because of my overall thesis, but I now hold 5/1 90cs that I plan to dump at open tomorrow after this news creates a pump. \n\nI do think this is bad for SPY though. The market is rallying like crazy in hopes this is a cure. A slightly reduced hospital stay, or a *new* hospital stay for someone who wants treatment but isn\u2019t dying yet (not sure this will be possible) and no significant improvement in mortality will not do anything to slow the virus or reduce its impact on the economy. So tomorrow morning I will flip my GILD calls into SPY puts.", "created_utc": 1588180038.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gad8y2/gilead_play_update_2/", "is_self": true}
