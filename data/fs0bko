He used to be tech support but after they cleaned house of their developers due to the leap year fiasco he was given an immediate promotion. He said that's how the previous team of devs got hired also, but idk if I believe it. Anyway, he was looking through old git repos for patched bugs to add back into the system and stumbled across this inversed logo, it was inside one of the original legacy branches of the app.\n\nI made this diagram comparing the two.\n\n[Coincidence or illuminati symbolism?](https://imgur.com/mmVTd1t)\n\nThose fucking assholes. They wanted us to believe they were helping the poor like the real Robin Hood ***but they inversed it!***\n\nFree trading, instant deposits, fractional shares. All free, at the low low cost of your personal data and losing access to your money during the times it matters most!\n\nSo look what happens when you inverse their logo. **It all makes sense!**\n\nThis next image might look familiar to some of you. I see looking through post positions that a lot of you have already learned to read this symbolism, but I figured I would help out the retards with a clue.\n\nNow I won't just hand you all the answers, you're going to have to do your own research to figure out the how to decode the cipher, but I'll tell you: **the clues are all inside the logo**.\n\nAnyway after we arrange the feathers and birds in according to the formula, we can plainly see the secret positions that we should be taking.\n\n[Top secret positions SPY 4\\/20 170P.](https://imgur.com/iV1rHOO)\n\n**Here's how we decoded this postion:**\n\n* The largest digit in **S&amp;P500** is 5, so 5 logos. We ignore any characters besides \"/\".\n* The largest digit in **4/20** is 4, 4 logos. There's a \"/\" so you know not to flip the logo's X axis here.\n* The largest digit in **170** is 7, but there's also a 1 and 0 so you subtract the largest digit from 10 instead, giving us 3 logos. Then multiply the value by 10 to get 1700.\n* I'll let you figure out why **PUt** has 3 logos. Again, not doing all the work for you.\n\nI know some of you are saying this doesn't make sense, that it's backwards and I'm retarded. And I say to you: ***exactly***.\n\nI got 69 of these for $0.31 at the peak for the ultimate top secret meme break even price of $169.69 on 4/20. You're welcome. When this hits, I may post the next top secret position.\n\n# Let's see how it works. It may, it may not... but we may have some incredible results. We're gonna know soon.\n\n**SPY 4/20 170P**\n\nEdit:\nTL:DR\nRobinHood\u2019s real logo is proof they\u2019re fucking their users.\n\nAlso fuck reddit for breaking my inline images.", "created_utc": 1585605818.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fs0bko/the_real_robinhood_logo_and_the_secret_symbolism/", "is_self": true}
