{"id": "hf13ii", "title": "Trading Platform", "selftext": "I know a lot of folks in this sub are a fan of RH  (I myself use it). With recent downtime and outages, I am thinking about moving away. I don't really day trade, and largely sell credit spreads and buy long ITM calls (I haven't yet YOLO'd, but have lost plenty on many weekly calls/puts). I would like to avoid fees and commission like on RH, just want to be able to access and place trades when I want. I have considered WeBull but I can't tell the difference between the two platforms. Does anyone have any recommendations?", "created_utc": 1593005631.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hf13ii/trading_platform/", "is_self": true}
