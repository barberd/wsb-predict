Things are going bad, but the stock market is going up.  It's illogical.\"\n\nAnd as a result, today the investment banks decided to pick on the entire railroad sector, slamming CSX down 11 percent, and punishing ALL THE REST OF THE RAILROADS so they get the message:  No matter what is ACTUALLY going on in the economy, don't slam or draw attention to the STOCK MARKET as your way to wriggle out of it. \n\nSo now, all the railrroads got punished today, just for what the CEO of CSX said. \n\nAny thoughts?\n\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-ceo-of-railroad-giant-csx-says-hes-baffled-by-the-us-economy-2019-07-17", "created_utc": 1563390279, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ceh7v9/eli5_the_investment_banks_picking_on_the/", "is_self": true}
