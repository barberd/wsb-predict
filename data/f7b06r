{"id": "f7b06r", "title": "Coronavirus: The Oil Killer", "selftext": "Alright, dipshits listen up. We all love TSLA and oil is ~~from~~ for dinosaurs. But what about actual DD?\n\nOil has been on a downward trend for months now. Go look at any oil ticker for the past few months and look at the drop-off. Worst January on record [according to this](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3537078-energy-sector-posts-worst-january-on-record). Personally, I like to watch ETFs so you're seeing the whole market drop off. \n\nThen the wutang virus hit. \n\nWhy does that matter? China is a big ass country with a lot of people driving a lot of demand. There's no demand when people ain't doing shit:\n\n&gt;\"When \\[Chinese\\] cities are placed under quarantine, and public transit is shut down, by definition that reduces economic activity and has a negative impact on energy demand, oil included,\" says Raymond James analyst John Freeman.\n\nRecently, Ned Davis Research said that \"[coronavirus is a \u2018black swan\u2019 for oil and energy markets](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/10/the-coronavirus-is-a-black-swan-for-oil-and-energy-markets-says-ned-davis-research.html)\".\n\nSo what am *I* doing? **Shorting oil. Puts baby.** \n\nRight now I'm in XOP, but considering adding to my position with Exxon (XOM) as they're looking like a carnival goldfish that just got introduced to your home fish tank. Belly up.\n\n\"BUT WAIT!\" you might say. \"Exxon and other oil companies are sitting on billions of dollars, you can't actually think they are going tits up?\" \n\nFuck no. Just short term. And here's where it gets good. We can double dip this play by going long on calls for the summer. Check out this chart:\n\n[https://imgur.com/he7liy3](https://imgur.com/he7liy3)\n\n**Gas prices go down this time of year and up in the summer.** It's not perfectly predictable but June/July is the typical peak here. Plus, there's been a lot of talk about OPEC conspiring to reduce supply to drive prices back up. From what I'm reading they're mostly waiting on Russia to join the party. \n\n**TL;DR:** I'm shorting oil through the next few weeks and have calls through summer. I'm in XOP personally but there's XOM, Shell, and a fuck load of other relevant ETFs.", "created_utc": 1582291304, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7b06r/coronavirus_the_oil_killer/", "is_self": true}
