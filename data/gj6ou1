{"id": "gj6ou1", "title": "The Fall of the CRE REITs", "selftext": "Technical sell signals triggered on these 3 that I have been watching.  Of the 3 CUZ is the weakest in terms of its portfolio and cash flow.  CRE Reits have been sold off hard after an initial April rally after disappointing results in their earnings.  Additionally, another factor in their sale has been dumping by institutions doing rebalancing of their funds into other things like chasing momentum plays in tech, biotech, and even utilities to be considered a safe haven.  These are not usually plays owned by the trend crowd - instead they are owned by pension funds and mutual funds who buy for municipal retirement plans and beloved by boomers for yielding consistent dividends.  Well, those dividends are not looking so consistent anymore.   These are commercial real estate landlords in big cities like NYC, Chicago, Boston, etc.\n\nWith unclear forward guidance (because these 3 all declined to give any) the fund managers reacted by selling hard.   Also notable is that on up days last week the CRE Reits continued to sell off.  Also they have broke yearly lows today in trading on the daily chart.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Another reason why funds have been selling stuff like dividend plays and preferred stocks is b/c of fears of inflation from all the govt printing.  So where is that money headed?  Precious metals and their miners to some extent and TIPS in fixed income or dollar denominated debt for emerging market sovereigns.   Keep in mind that funds are restricted in what they can buy/hold so no they will not buying crypto or TSLA or anything crazy - they have to stay conservative per their own guidelines.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Headed to 21 near term - possibly the upper teens by mid-summer.  Weakest of the 3 in terms of portfolio.  Warning - options volume is very light in this one so proceed with caution.](https://preview.redd.it/3vovwiet9ly41.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb2bbf0f22ba2800e77c681ac8b82bd162a7d446)\n\n[Very strong sell signal - the 3x bottom  breakdown adds another leg of confirmation to the 2x bottom signal.
