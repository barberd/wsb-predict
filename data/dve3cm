See it\u2019s currently 2019 and last year it was 2018 and so on. So if my DD and TA are correct then soon it will be 2020. Now I havnt figured out how to invest in the date but there\u2019s something special I SEE in the year 2020... 2020... 20-20... think about it. Where have you heard of 20-20 being good before? Well probably not in your eye exams cause you spend all day looking at 8 computer screens loaded with charts but because it\u2019s 2020 you subconsciously are reminded day after day that you want better eyes so here\u2019s what you do. Liquidate all your assets and YOLO far out naked calls on $EYE and $EYES. \n\nTLDR: 2020 is the year of the eye and most people haven\u2019t seen the trend yet. Your welcome.
