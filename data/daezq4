This holy synergy makes it so you don't give a fuck, which is a big issue that hold people back from their 10 bagger trades. Also, if you lose a lot of money, you can blame it on the fact that you were drunk and not the fact that you (like me) have absolutely not a single scrap of trading skill. Not to mention, you'll save time in the \"get blackout drunk after halving your portfolio\" phase.\n\n\n/DD", "created_utc": 1569671417, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/daezq4/dd_on_drinking_whilst_trading/", "is_self": true}
