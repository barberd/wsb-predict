{"id": "g3494d", "title": "Advertising and the gravity of reality", "selftext": "Fuck 2008 comparisons, let's look back at 2001.\n\nTech stocks were soaring, people were buying stocks to crazy levels despite reality, Buffett retreated to his cave. Not dissimilar to right now. Then it all came crashing down.\n\nWhat gets lost in the noise is that *advertising rates fucking sank like a rock, almost immediately*. I'm talking $35 CPM rates went to $1 within a month. Why is this relevant? There are many, many signs that advertising is dead right now, across the board. Affiliates are cancelling programs, ad prices and revenue are dead, etc. Ads are the first thing that get cut in situations like this. And why not? No one is buying shit they don't need right now and companies are hoarding their cash. This is a systemic issue because people aren't going to spend as much on random shit, but more importantly *companies aren't going to spend anything trying to get extra market share.* They all shut it down in recessions, every time.\n\nOnce they drop, ads stay low for a long time. Ads are a marketplace and ad prices only go up with competition. That takes a long time to rebuild. Even if everything turns rosy, ad revenue is going to be dismal for at least a year and has no chance of getting \"back to normal\" for years.\n\nSo who gets fucked? All companies that rely on ad revenue, especially exclusively ad revenue. They see the shit on the wall right away. $YELP, who already fired a bunch of people and furloughed more. $SNAP is fucked. $PINS is fucked. All these companies are going to be a bloodbath when earnings come out (or likely before that when people start to notice). Fuck their cash reserves, that is now their burn rate. Think about where these companies should be priced when suddenly getting only 20% revenue with their expensive offices and expensive employees. They are going to shrivel up as quickly as they can if they want to survive at all.\n\nYes, this also means $GOOG is going to eat shit. Google announced they are stopping/slowing hiring immediately and just cut summer interns, too. They get almost all their revenue from ads. Immediately that revenue has gone tits up and will stay at a fraction for some time. There is no way they don't get screwed here.\n\nThis isn't a stimulus-fixable issue, it is a deep, long-term reaming for years to come. This is WITHOUT considering joblessness, lockdowns, COVID outbreaks, supply chain issues, etc. **These companies literally can't make half their income for quite a while.** Understand that and everything is straightforward.\n\nThe only question is, where to stick your puts? I think once earnings hit in May the writing will be on the wall for all of these companies, probably before. But June/July is a bit safer so you don't have to cry when your puts go down 50% in a day from some continued frothy bullshit. If you are smart, accumulate puts carefully until the market starts to turn then buy even more when the selloff starts.\n\nThe market is not recognizing how quickly the bottom comes for ad-sensitive businesses in a sharp market turn.\n\n**TL;DR Jun/Jul puts on YELP, SNAP, PINS, GOOG**", "created_utc": 1587137616.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g3494d/advertising_and_the_gravity_of_reality/", "is_self": true}
