Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania said, \u201cI think we probably have the primary responsibility for opening it up.\u201d\n\nHe joined the governors of Connecticut, Delaware, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island on a conference call, where they agreed to create a committee of public health officials, economic development officials and their chiefs of staff to work together as they decide when to ease the restrictions they have put in place to slow the spread of the virus. They said they did not necessarily expect to act together or to create a one-size-fits-all solution, but they stressed the need for regional cooperation.\n\nOn the West Coast, the governors of California, Oregon and Washington also announced Monday what they called a Western States Pact to work together on a joint approach to reopening economies. They said that while each state would have its own specific plan, the states would build out a West Coast strategy that would include how to control the virus in the future. \u201cOur states will only be effective by working together,\u201d they said in a joint statement.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom of California said on Monday that he had been in discussions with the other governors to coordinate efforts on the West Coast. He said that on Tuesday he would outline the \u201cCalifornia-based thinking\u201d on reopening and promised it would be guided by \u201cfacts,\u201d \u201cevidence\u201d and \u201cscience.\u201d\n\nThe stay-at-home orders that have kept a vast majority of Americans indoors [were issued state by state, by their governors](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-economy.html). The president did issue nonbinding guidelines urging a pause in daily life through the end of the month; in some states that had resisted such measures, including Florida, his input helped spur governors to act. If the federal government were to issue new guidance saying it was safe to relax those measures or outlining a path toward reopening, many states would most likely follow or feel tremendous pressure from their businesses and constituents to relax restrictions.\n\nBut Mr. Trump, who said Friday that the decision of when to reopen the country would be the biggest he would ever make, said Monday on Twitter that it was up to the president, not the governors, to decide when to reopen the states.\n\n\u201cA decision by me, in conjunction with the Governors and input from others, will be made shortly!\u201d [he wrote](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1249712413219397632).\n\nBut several of the governors who spoke Monday made it clear that they did not intend to let businesses in their states reopen until experts and data suggested it would be safe to do so. They noted that their fates were bound by geography. \u201cThe reality is this virus doesn\u2019t care about state borders, and our response shouldn\u2019t either,\u201d Gov. Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island said.\n\n\u201cWe can put together a system that allows our people to get back to work,\u201d Gov. Ned Lamont of Connecticut said. But he warned against reopening too soon and risking a second wave of infections.\n\nIn Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott said Monday that he was working closely with the White House on his plan to reopen the state\u2019s businesses. He called for a staggered approach in which businesses that have a minimal impact on the spread of the virus would open up first.\n\n\u201cThis is not going to be a rush-the-gates\u201d situation, said Mr. Abbott, who has been criticized for making Texas one of the last states to issue a statewide stay-at-home order.\n\nEarlier on Monday, Mr. Cuomo said New York\u2019s known death toll had exceeded 10,000, with 671 people dying on Sunday. Nearly 2,000 more people were hospitalized on Sunday \u2014 a vast number, though lower than previous tallies \u2014 and there were fewer intubations. But even as he hinted that he believed that \u201cthe worst is over,\u201d [he warned the situation would worsen](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-update.html?action=click&module=Spotlight&pgtype=Homepage) if New Yorkers behaved recklessly.\n\n\u201cNot as bad as it has been in the past, but basically flat, and basically flat at a horrific level of pain and grief and sorrow,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said.", "created_utc": 1586810757.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0r99z/nytimes_governors_on_both_coasts_announce_efforts/", "is_self": true}
