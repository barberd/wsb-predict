Now after a 10% green dildo some of you guys see the fuckery the Fed and fellow idiots are capable of, and I'm pretty sure half of you switch back to being gay bulls.\n\nAnyways, ZeroHedge just posted another article confirming the same idea - complete with lot of pretty crayon graphs for those who don't like words.\n\nFrom ZeroHedge:\n\n[$850 Billion In Stock Buying Is About To Be Unleashed](https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/850-billion-stock-buying-about-be-unleashed)\n\nPersonally tomorrow I'll probably be closing out the Puts I bought EOD today, and roll to calls.\n\n***EDIT***:  Also consider this narrative plays well into the rally potential that [Variation-Separate](https://www.reddit.com/user/Variation-Separate/) identified in this [excellent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmhz1p/the_great_unwinding_why_wsb_will_keep_losing/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) 3 days ago.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not trying to say that this is gonna be some face ripping rally, blowing away any previous record. I'm just thinking we could see a concerted move to the upside from the big money managers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR**: Moving to calls through the end of the month, cause Pensions and Quants have more money than I do.  THEN BACK TO PUTS.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSPY   250/255/260C  3/31 thru 4/3\n\nor if your account balance is small like your penis,\n\nEWZ 25C 3/27   or   EWZ 24C 4/17  (Do whatever you like, just make sure it has the volume to support)", "created_utc": 1585107258.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fojezf/dd_spy_end_of_month_rally_follow_up_post/", "is_self": true}
