And other bad INTC trends", "selftext": "Next week at the Apple developer's conference, Apple is expected to announce that they will be dumping Intel and moving to ARM chips.\n\n[Apple's shift to ARM Mac at WWDC next week](https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/06/13/apples-shift-to-arm-mac-from-intel-at-wwdc-will-define-a-decade-of-computing)\n\nThis has been a strong rumor for a while now, next week will be the public announcement.\n\nIn terms of immediate impact, this is not great, but not huge - MacOS is has around just under 10% marketshare (depending on which survey)\n\n[macos reached 9.65 of desktop/laptop os marketshare](https://hostingtribunal.com/blog/operating-systems-market-share/)\n\nHowever it represents a deeper long term problem. Programs written for Intel x86 architecture chips do not run on ARM chips. Switching chips requires all the software vendors to make minor modifications to their programs to work on the new architecture. Given that the programs typically took years to develop, even a minor modification might take weeks. And, this will require that consumers making the transition obtain new versions of their programs.\n\nThe point is, it's a medium-size hassle, and not one that Apple would undertake unless there is a **major** advantage to moving to Intel.\n\nThe advantages are power and (surprisingly) speed. Intel chips have always been power hungry, which is not good for laptops. In years past Intel offset this by being faster, but surprisingly that gap had started to disappear by 2017\n\n[iPhone 8 faster than intel Core i5](https://9to5mac.com/2017/09/22/iphone-8-geekbench-test-scores/)\n\nand it's only gotten worse since then. One key problem is that Intel is struggling to move to 10nm, whereas Apple is already shipping 7nm and moving to 5nm next.  Smaller nm (nanometers) means less power and somewhat faster.\n\nThe ARM advantage over Intel has become too compelling to ignore, and other PC makers will be making the switch in coming years. Microsoft has already been trying (several times), with mixed success.\n\n[https://www.androidauthority.com/windows-on-arm-review-1074547/](https://www.androidauthority.com/windows-on-arm-review-1074547/)[https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20887386/microsoft-surface-event-pro-7-arm-windows-laptops](https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20887386/microsoft-surface-event-pro-7-arm-windows-laptops)\n\nPeople are also trying to replace Intel on Servers,[https://www.anandtech.com/show/15578/cloud-clash-amazon-graviton2-arm-against-intel-and-amd](https://www.anandtech.com/show/15578/cloud-clash-amazon-graviton2-arm-against-intel-and-amd)\n\nAnd (for different reasons) Intel is also loosing some ground to AMD.\n\nAll these efforts are having (or will have) mixed success initially.But the point is that *everyone* is trying to get away from Intel.\n\nPosition: crouching, sold INTC, and puts for next week.\n\nEDIT: changed flair DD->Stocks.
