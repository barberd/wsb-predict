{"id": "es9zdw", "title": "Buy the DIP", "selftext": "Good day, my esteemed fellow autists, and less auspicious retards,\n\nA new dawn is upon us, with the dickening of Detroit, and with it we have the opportunity to build a utopia - one specifically designed for our mental disease; however, we can't do it without a plan and without the DD from last night's smoke circle.\n\nWith that, I propose the first Detroit Improvement Proposal, or DIP. This is a city design for the downtown area of whatever shithole this sub takes over through dickmeet.\n\n&lt;blockquote class=\"imgur-embed-pub\" lang=\"en\" data-id=\"a/qmfGlx8\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"[//imgur.com/a/qmfGlx8](//imgur.com/a/qmfGlx8)\"&gt;Detroit Improvement Proposal #1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src=\"[//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js](//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js)\" charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/qmfGlx8](https://imgur.com/a/qmfGlx8)\n\nHere it is proposed that the heart of the downtown area be the WTC, or World Tendie Center, across from which will be a Wendy's for your lunch Tendies. It will also be aside a Chuck E. Cheese for when your autism is triggered and can only be comforted by a ball pit, as well as a Suicide Prevention Center that will have a 24/7 Short Bus metro line. Both the WTC and the Wendy's will be built identically, with staff at the WTC trained to only answer questions with \"Sir, this is a Wendy's\", and Wendy's staff with \"GUH.\"\n\nThe WTC will also be serviced by the Hooker Hyperloop, directly connecting the WTC to the red light district, which will be built once approved by DIP #69 legalizing prostitution. A single stop, at the Yayo facility, will provide the quickest transportation available to convert your tendies into hookers and blow.\n\nWhile this DIP assumes all residents will be card-carrying members of bull gang, resources will be allocated for a Bear Den Homeless Shelter. Ideally situated next to the Wendy's for dumpster diving, the Elon Musk Statue for inspiration, and the Short Seller Cemetery for the eventual reality, a dignified, and quarantined, area is planned for should the need arise.\n\nAdditionally, since this city aims to be a cultural powerhouse for those with excessive PRT, an iconic Autism Opera House should be built, for YOLO'ers wishing to partake in the REEEEEEEE's of professional autists.\n\nAs this is a working draft, contributions are welcome. I propose this plan or it's future variation, in addition to future DIP's, be discussed at DickMeet.", "created_utc": 1579687975, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/es9zdw/buy_the_dip/", "is_self": true}
