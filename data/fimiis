Today he said if he can\u2019t get what he wants, lower interest rates, changes can be me. I\u2019m taking that as a red flag. IMO if (really when) we get to 2016 levels I think he\u2019ll stop short selling. His mental state can\u2019t handle the media piling on the headlines against the last thing going for him. He\u2019s bet everything on the economy (like a true autist) and won\u2019t give it up.\n\nTL;DR: Trump will stop short selling at 2016 levels", "created_utc": 1584208870.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fimiis/trump_will_not_let_the_economy_fall_below_2016/", "is_self": true}
