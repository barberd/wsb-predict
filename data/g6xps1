{"id": "g6xps1", "title": "Losing money on every trade? Spread'em, boys.", "selftext": "Go ahead, let's see the tears. Tell me how you consistently guess wrong and lose money. Tell me more about how even when you guess correctly you still lose money. You bought your gay bear puts and the market actually went down, and you're still seeing red. You have no idea what a break even is and to you IV crush is just some orange soda they put into your veins in the hosipital. Spreadding is something you only do for your wife's boyfriend. You can't afford to even play TSLA or AMZN. You're bleeding every day like it's once again your time of month.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat if I told you, you can afford to play AMZN, that you can make money even if you're wrong a little bit and we're not even talking theta gang. We're talking about directional plays where you just have to be a little bit right, and that's affordable on any stock. With one big cock in the ass draw back - your unlimited gains are over. You can only earn a limited amount of money. Now go ahead and ignore the rest of this post, put a remindme 6 months in the comments and come back when you're bleeding red from every oraface and ready to suck shrek's big green dick. Go ahead, I'll be waiting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBack? Good. Now listen up. You're losing money when you're wrong, you're losing money when you're right, you're playing shit stocks with shit liquidity because you don't know how the game works. IV is high, options are expensive. Since you won't understand big financial words I'm going to explain this with examples.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRight now MSFT is trading at $171.42. You're absolutely positive they are going to moon next week, but your broke ass can't afford $3.80 for a $175 weekly call. But let's say you go suck some dick in the Wal-Mart parking lot and come up with the money. What now? You buy your call. When do you make money? Well with an IV of 46.9 you just paid a shit ton for that call, so to make up for the money you paid MSFT has to hit $178.92 by next Friday before you see a penny. Let's say you get lucky and it closes at $183.33. Congrats! You're happy as hell because your poor ass just made $250.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile you're fucking around not knowing what you're doing, I bought 3 call debit spreads. WTF is a call debit spread you ask? I bought a $170 weekly call and also sold a $172.50 weekly call. Selling that call does several things. It drastically lowers my break even, it drastically lowers my cost and it caps my gains. But let's take a look at the numbers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis trade only cost me $1.13. So I bought 3 of them for $3.39 and still paid less than you did for a single call. Ok so when do I make money? If they close anywhere above $171.08 next week, I've got shreks dick all over me squirting out tendies. That's fucking less than they're trading right now. I like those chances. How much money do I make? If MSFT closes anywhere over $172.50 I make my full amount of.... $411.00. For you to make that much on your call MSFT has to close over $185.00.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I'm trading with better odds at lower prices and consistently slobbering shreks dick while you're bleeding like oil in Oklahoma hoping for unlimited gains that will never come. Oh and if you're actually gay, this works with puts as well.", "created_utc": 1587685482.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6xps1/losing_money_on_every_trade_spreadem_boys/", "is_self": true}
