{"id": "g98rz1", "title": "Long put on Arch Coal", "selftext": "This is my first DD so feel free to straight up flame me over it.\n\nSomeone posted last week about coal not doing well. I work in the energy industry so I decided to take a look. Here are two different articles talking about how coal is struggling right now:\n\n[MSN](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/in-global-electricity-slump-coal-is-the-big-loser/ar-BB13gMeA?li=BBnbfcL)\n\n[NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/23/842807177/pandemic-shutdown-is-speeding-up-the-collapse-of-coal?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=nprblogscoronavirusliveupdates)\n\nArch coal is the second largest coal producer in the US. And one look at their charts shows they were struggling before COVID came to play. We can see that for the past several months their stock prices have fallen by at least $7. Today their revenue and EPS forecasts were [downgraded](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/arch-coal-inc-nyse-arch-121046986.html)\n\nI think things will continue to get worse for several reasons\n\n* Continued [renewable energy growth](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/energy-and-resources/articles/renewable-energy-outlook.html)\n* Natural gas will continue to [decline](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/natural-gas-price-prediction-prices-drop-on-annual-inventory-estimate3s-645883)\n* Average summer temperatures for coal heavy parts of the US\n\nMost of the coal-heavy parts of the US are expected to have average summers. For the most part, the few sections of the country that are going\nto experience the hottest summer are also less coal dependent states (e.g. the pacific NW, which relies heavily on hydro-electric) with the exception of Texas. My point is that while the temperature won't necessarily *hurt* their bottom line, it won't be helping it this year.\nThe image below compares summer temperature projections with coal usage by state.\n\n[Coal Consumption vs Projected temperatures](https://imgur.com/a/mUSPFgK)\n\nSources for above photos\n[Summer Temps outlook](https://weather.com/forecast/national/news/2020-04-15-summer-2020-temperature-outlook-may-june-july-august)\n[coal consumption](https://www.eia.gov/coal/data/browser/#/topic/20?agg=1,0&geo=vvvvvvvvvvvvo&freq=A&start=2008&end=2018&ctype=map&ltype=pin&rtype=s&pin=&rse=0&maptype=0)\n \nAll of this doesn't even factor in the decrease in demand caused by all of the businesses shut down right now.\n\nI know of Utilities that have been pro coal for decades that have been swapping out coal for Natural Gas and renewable energy.\nI predict the price will fall to at least 13.5 a share. \n\nTL;DR\n\nARCH 06/19 17.5p", "created_utc": 1588019524.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g98rz1/long_put_on_arch_coal/", "is_self": true}
