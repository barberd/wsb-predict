{"id": "fcy6z9", "title": "$JNUG to the moon", "selftext": "Thoughts post recent developments:\n\nSome people were expecting some sort of major action by G-7 this morning, but that's not what their role is...\n\nThat being said, we're starting to see coordinated action by central banks. First inter-meeting Fed cut post-GFC, rate cut by RBA, etc\n\nSo where to invest from here? Gold.... Esp Gold miners (Prefer JNUG for more convexity)\n\nRationale:\n\n1. Currency pairs get all sorts of screwey when all central banks lower rates together (during both coordinated action and race-to-the-bottom situations), but typically fall vs GC. Gold is (obviously) the biggest driver of gold miner equities\n2. $JNUG is filled with overseas companies (14 Australian, 36 Canadian vs 6 US). Very few countries have the ability to cut rates as much as the US, which means USD should trend down vs most currencies. USD weakening means that the value of foreign equities in USD terms should increase.\n3. $JNUG is, at the end of the day, still full of equities and somewhat correlated to markets. Regardless of future nCoV developments, should see some equities stability (vs last week at least) due to coordinated central banks efforts.\n\nThree major tailwinds to $JNUG = first time I'm long gold miners vs gold in a long time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit (Positions): Can't trade derivatives on my account; am long 1,000 shares (cash equities)", "created_utc": 1583257144.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fcy6z9/jnug_to_the_moon/", "is_self": true}
