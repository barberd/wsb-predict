Here are two events that are not priced in.  \n\nFirst, **war in the middle east**.  Do you think the Iranians forgot about Soleimani?  They were not going to give Trump a reason to own them in January.  Things have changed.  They were binding their time to attack when America was weak or distracted.  They have already proven they can destroy Saudi oil installations, and Saudi just gave a big F U to to Republicans in Congress responsible for their defense by flooding the market with oil. \n\n[This Nouriel Roubini interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EI5NRhoPstk)  At 40:20 Roubini explains how regime survival incentives an escalation.\n\nSecond, **a severe contraction of the money supply**.  Yea the fed is creating money by making loans to both the private and public sector.  Making loans increases the money supply which which has the effect of brrrrrrrrrrrrr.  The issue is a wave of defaults has the opposite effect, it leads to a massive contraction of the money supply which = deflation.  When an entity defaults on a loan that money just disappears, never to be seen again.  The future beyond three months is very murky, no one knows how many insolvent companies are out there in a post-Covid world.  If they just gave newly created money to people directly this could be avoided, but chances of that are unlikely beyond the survival checks just sent out.  A severe contraction in the money supply would increase defaults by making debt payments more expensive per economics 101.  Oh and the credit markets would freeze up.  This is the specter hunting Powell and why he looks nervous when he speaks in public.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYea I may lose a lot more money but XLK 9/18 80p      FB 9/18 160p", "created_utc": 1587098569.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2v5fh/bear_gang_did_nothing_wrong/", "is_self": true}
