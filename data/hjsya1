{"id": "hjsya1", "title": "Acadia Healthcare Corp - NYSE: ACHC", "selftext": "I know that no one here likes real DD. But this company is going to fall apart.\n\nAcadia Healthcare Corp (ACHC) is a company that provides inpatient and outpatient behavioral medical care in the US, UK, and Puerto Rico. This includes psychiatric facilities, addiction centers, and other programs or treatment centers for people with behavioral / psychological problems. ACHC will be going bankrupt, or experiencing material degradation of their underlying business, in the next two years.\n\nRegardless of how they are able to perform, the debt coming due relative to their cash flow is insurmountable. They are already a mature company, so there is no chance to grow their way out of the issue in which they find themselves. Historical revenue growth has been in the single digits. With COVID in 2020 and many elective treatments being delayed, their performance in 2020 will be muted at best. Based on Q1 2020 results, their performance this year is already expected to be worse than prior years. Here is a snapshot of their cash flow (2020 RR = Q1 2020 x 4 to annualize):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zyrr7k7f2e851.png?width=841&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8c3beac1b9de8375fd356bc920c89aa73b23ee3\n\nNow pay attention, there is an important concept in that picture, because levered free cash flow is basically how much money we can expect the company to generate to pay future debt, after they pay all other obligations and necessary business expenses. Let's be generous and say that by some miracle ACHC is able to produce $100 million of levered FCF per year for each year into the future. That is higher than any level seen in the prior three years by about 2x. That level of cash flow is unlikely, as revenue is not moving anywhere fast, EBITDA appears to be flat, cash interest will not decline until debt is due, capex looks consistent (you need equipment and facilities!), and taxes are... taxes.\n\n**Capital Structure**\n\nSo now that we know what their cash flow profile looks like, let's take a look at their capital structure. Looking at ACHC's debt, they are challenged in two ways: upcoming maturities and financial covenants. They have substantial maturities coming in the next three years, and do not have the cash on hand to cover the maturities ($181 million in cash after they pulled on their revolver).\n\nOn top of that, and this is important to remember, the company also has financial covenants. ACHC has to meet a Consolidated Debt / EBITDA ratio, which is essentially total debt divided by their EBITDA. Long-term, they are only able to support debt that totals 5.0x their EBITDA. For 2020 (due to COVID), ACHC had to negotiate with their creditors to increase the Consolidated Debt / EBITDA covenant to 6.25x, declining to 5.25x in 2021, and 5.0x each year after. If Acadia reports EBITDA that causes their leverage ratio to be above the covenant, they have to i) negotiate a waiver from their lenders, or ii) default on their debt. REMEMBER THIS. This is a guillotine that is always waiting over the company ready to drop.\n\nNow, unfortunately for the company, their debt just matures too damn fast. Here is a breakdown by total dollar value of maturities with timing, noting that this does not include the small debt amortization payments made along the way, which will be a use of cash and a reduction of what's due (just timing):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/04ulwjvmae851.png?width=632&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc57367c5befeb35bfd04a0066633aedaa5b6f21\n\nYou can see the kill shot is in 2023. But it is actually much worse. The cash Acadia produces will not come close to being enough to pay for anything. Even if Acadia used its entire revolver. Even if Acadia doubled it's freaking cash flow every year they could not pay for jack shit. DOUBLING CASH FLOW IS AN INSANE ASSUMPTION AND THEY ARE STILL SHORT $240 MILLION. IN EXAMPLE 2, CASH FLOW GROWTH IS LESS INSANE, BUT STILL MORE CASH THAN THEY HAVE EVER MADE, AND **THEY MISS BY OVER $1 BILLION.**\n\n[\\*2021 - 2023 levered FCF is still 4 times higher than what the company has ever generated.](https://preview.redd.it/6emrp6kb2e851.png?width=470&format=png&auto=webp&s=a748da106fc3a936f5c6652e1258d866e7d5f52f)\n\n**Solutions to ACHC's Problems**\n\nOkay, RestructurKing, you are right, this looks like shit. Can't they just refinance though? In Insane scenario, probably yes, fair enough, they'll be okay. But the risk with refinancing is, you guessed it, the MFing covenants. If you just refinance shit, it will always be due later, and you will never improve against your covenant, which reduces to 5.0x in 2022.\n\n*Situation 1 -* If ACHC refinances the 2021 debt, they are still at $3.3 billion in debt on $550 million in EBITDA at the end of 2021, which is 6.0x. Unless they grow EBITDA to $660 million (20% YoY growth), they are donzo. No chance to grow EBITDA though, because they couldn't grow it at all the last three years without COVID, so they are extra fucked. Boom, blew a fucking covenant day god damn one.\n\n*Situation 2 -* ACHC somehow pays down the 2021 debt with the cash they can't generate (using the revolver to pay debt would keep debt constant). Total debt is $2.9 billion now in 2022.\n\n* EBITDA is still $550 million? Oops, blew the fucking covenant again (2,900 / 550 = \\~5.25x).\n* EBITDA is at least $580 million? Okay, no covenant default. Oops, still need to find $455 million of cash to pay down debt. They don't find it? Boom, bankruptcy.\n* ACHC does find the cash? Excellent, player advances to 2023. $1.5 billion of debt is due. No cash? Bankruptcy.\n\nThey will not last through 2023. They will have to pay down $794 million in 2021 and 2022, more than 10 times their best levered free cash flow year from the last three years. Based on historical performance, they will never generate that amount of cash.\n\nIn short, the only way for the company to cover their maturities is to cut uses of cash, like capital expenditures. Cutting necessary business expenses would undermine business operations, which would ultimately cause a decline in performance and thus stock price.\n\n**TL;DR** Lots of upcoming debt maturities and no cash flow. Acadia's options are to do the following:\n\n1. Refinance - They only kick the can down the road, and are always subject to a 5.0x leverage covenant which they currently cannot meet. ACHC will default. Share price falls.\n2. Can't Refinance - Company cannot generate enough cash to pay down debt and risks default in 2021, likely in 2022. Share price falls.\n3. Cut Necessary Expenses - Company undermines its own business model by cutting important business expenses to cover debt. Share price falls on poorer performance.", "created_utc": 1593676875.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hjsya1/acadia_healthcare_corp_nyse_achc/", "is_self": true}
