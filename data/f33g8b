She made a one time deal, so if I lose then that's that.\n\nWith that said, I will be taking my mother to retire on the moon. She gets rewarded with some of the sweet profit. Also, I've already started paying her back just in case Richard Branson decides to screw me. \n\nLiterally can't go tits up to the moon. In the meantime, MSFT $200 20/3 looks nice.", "created_utc": 1581563843, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f33g8b/mom_gave_me_a_2000_loan_for_spce_calls/", "is_self": true}
