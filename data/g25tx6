If you are long on oil they charge you enormous daily fee's. However, if you are **short**, you receive an **overnight refund** and over the weekend an even greater refund (see very bottom of image)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9hux3byl63t41.png?width=1276&format=png&auto=webp&s=65742a53714158495f1c1849675aa06a78346c35\n\nWith oil reserves filling up to the brim and a second deal with Opec potentially several weeks away when oil hits new low's it feel like its one-way traffic for oil.\n\nNow, If you hold a position with Etoro x 10 leverage, for example, it pays 10% per day and 25% per weekend... I being completely retarded or is this not basically free money? if the position stays in play a week you cover your position and there is still a significant chance of oil dipping from here.\n\nEDIT - for the record, i am not looking at a 50x leverage, this was an example. I am considering $10,000 on a 10x leverage. which pays $892 per day and $2,677 per weekend\n\nEDIT 2. I have placed these two trades. With a total risk of $2,500. I think this is an excellent value bet, which pays $498 USD per day and $1500 per weekend to remain on\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aagkqht8p3t41.png?width=2292&format=png&auto=webp&s=acb7b36f13efffeab2a7d155fe7143f790552607\n\n&#x200B;\n\n.", "created_utc": 1587002191.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g25tx6/selling_oil_free_money_from_brokerages_via/", "is_self": true}
