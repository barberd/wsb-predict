Stop shorting TSLA", "selftext": "First things first if you lost money going against Elon its fucking well deserved.\n\nFor all the crying I hear about the fUnDaMeNtAlS not adding up, that is the lie you tell yourself to justify getting your ass destroyed.\nLet's not act like fundamentals is the sole factor that drives all stocks.\n\nThe truth is you traded TSLA on raw fucking emotion and this is what you get for going against Elon. Your stupid ass said \"wow TSLA is uppy alotty so it must come back downy.\" Solid fucking DD your ass got rapey. Congratulations.\n\nHow the fuck can you 100% give a value on a company that has no direct comparables and don't give me that GM Ford bullshit.\n\nSay it with me \"Tesla is not just a car company\" \n\nFucking say it out loud, I see you just reading. SAY IT!\n\nIt's funny how some of you fucks will ride a meme stock to the high havens but look at TSLA and start talking about value. Fucks.\n\nImagine trying to explain to your future child about how you lost a shit ton of money on TSLA because fundamentals.... Little Jimmy will be looking back at you rockin his Tesla prosthetic legs and call you a fucking idiot.\n\nThe point, stop shorting TSLA don't borrow the stock sell it, don't buy puts, don't sell calls, just fucking quit.\n\nOverall if you cant understand TSLAs move, which most people can't just don't trade the fucking stock. Stay away, you don't have to trade what you don't understand.", "created_utc": 1580382776, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ew3tmt/im_only_going_to_say_this_once_stop_shorting_tsla/", "is_self": true}
