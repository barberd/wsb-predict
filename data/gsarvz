{"id": "gsarvz", "title": "Massive open interest increase in 300 puts that expire tomorrow. Don't get sucked in", "selftext": "A bunch of retards are buying 300 $spy puts that expire in less than 36 hours like they're gonna run out.  Well guess what?  The dealers that sold those puts have to delta hedge their short put position.  If these retard speculators get paper hands and give their puts back, the dealers will buy back their delta hedge (which means they will be buying $spy) and, maybe, send this thing flying to even higher bullshit levels.  There is a massive amount of long call gamma below 305 that $spy will have to fight through before it even THINKS about touching 300.  Please think twice before calling the top.\n\nEdit:  put OI change from yesterday highlighted in green on the right, gamma weighted OI highlighted on the left\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3gx7h38fnj151.png?width=1580&format=png&auto=webp&s=f51664603e1bdfac608e4eaabc30a6c9efcee1fa", "created_utc": 1590687529.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gsarvz/massive_open_interest_increase_in_300_puts_that/", "is_self": true}
