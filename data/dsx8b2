{"id": "dsx8b2", "title": "$GPRO EARNINGS THREAD IS RIGHT FUCKING HERE! [BONUS LONG DD]", "selftext": "Estimate EPS: -$0.48  \nActual: After 11/7 market close  \n\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-gopro-gpro-q3-143402695.html  \n\n\nPersonal DD: This is such a great spot to buy GPRO IMO. This could be the last disaster quarter. Q3 was seemingly spent buying all the Hero8 parts &amp; paying Mexico to put that shit together. They also moved operations from China to Mexico, at apparently great expense. The call is going to tell the tale, IMO. So Q3 they spend, and Q4 they print, selling all those cute little action camera cubes to every Tom, Dick, and trans Jane-Harry that thinks they are the next Red Bull shit screemer champion, or believes their newfound love of paddleboarding requires filming themselves doing it so they can post the RealSteady footage on social media, making it official. You have to remember, this is a company that has been absolutely shit on for the past few years. The street laughed as they floundered in the drone game, but that chapter is closed. The C.E.Bro, Nick Woodman, the most Chad name possible without being named Chad, started this shit in 2002 because he ate drugs and changed his whole perspective on shit. He realized he abused his baby, and now is nursing it back to health. No social media, no bullshit, just a few weeks per year doing extreme sports with his snow bunny and the rest is nose to grindstone. Don't take some autists' word for it, listen to the man himself:  \n\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/video/2019/03/08/gopro-ceo-nick-woodman-opens-up-about-gopros-struggles.html  \n\n\nThis play is Buffet level shit but in the small cap kiddie game - this is one where you buy common shares and hold, betting on the C.E.Bro to do what he says he's going to do. Shareholders also have the buyout chance, a \\~$500m cap means that the big boys may make Nick an offer he can't refuse. AAPL, GOOG, FB, private equity, one rich guy in UAE... the price is so attractive for an established multi-decade world-wide brand &amp; 16m on Insta. But the real bet is that Nick turns it around, and this shit starts to get valued on Hero profits, which without the other distractions, could be coming soon. Imagine a profitable GPRO valued at 1x Gross sales, that's about double the current stock price. Could happen in just a year or two.   \n\n\n*My flair doesn't allow Earnings. Assume mods only or I'm autisticly retarded. Also what does GUH mean?  I realize it is the term for the Robinhood trick that allows you to sell ITM calls and keep buying common and keep selling the covered calls, and for whatever personal deficiency I read this shit daily but couldn't figure out the actual acronym or funny beginning to it. thank you for your sarcastic responses.*", "created_utc": 1573130769, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dsx8b2/gpro_earnings_thread_is_right_fucking_here_bonus/", "is_self": true}
