If you are only trading 3 times a week because of PDT you NEED to be trading every day; trade in a sim and be serious about it. Set your balance to a realistic amount.\n2. **I'd suggest recording your trades every single day and then evaluating it!** If you aren't doing this you're dramatically slowing your learning curve. Your own trades are by far the most beneficial learning tool available. Learning different trading theories, strategies/setups, or forms of technical analysis all matter far less then understanding where you're currently failing.\n3. **Drop the chart vomit.** If you're day trading you don't have the time to consult ichimoku cloud, Elliot waves, fibonacci retracements, RSI, MACD, bollinger bands, ect ect. If you have chart vomit, and it's working, then ignore this. If you have chart vomit and you're failing... KEEP IT SIMPLE! If you are wondering what I use I have 9&20 ema + vwap.\n4. **Do not make excuses to buy in!** From talking with 100s of traders and reviewing their trades, one theme that I've found is forcing trades. Some traders will find what I can best describe as 'scuffed' setups and proceed to buy into them. If this resonates with you, try considering your self a consumer. You enter the market and there's an abundance of product that all cost the same. You're going to buy the best, most quality product. Do not buy shitty patterns/setups when trading. You're spending your money, you deserve A+ quality setups.\n5. **Relax on the news.** This might surprise you, but I do not ever bother reading news. I'm a day trader, it really doesn't affect me because I have nearly no negative exposure to it. I'm searching for stocks that fit my criteria. My criteria filters for stocks that have high volume and subsequently high volatility. Whether this volume & volatility was created from a news catalyst, trading groups picking up on it, or even a P&D, I still make money on it. Knowing what actually caused the move doesn't affect my trading and therefore feels like wasted effort.\n6. **Don't try and predict moves OR chase them.** Nobody can know the future, obviously. If we believe this then trading due to a prediction would have to be considered COMPLETE gambling. I trade 8 setups each with pretty high win rates. These setups are not predicting breakouts, but rather identifying breakouts early. I will often buy breakouts 20-40% into the move and generally sell towards the end of the move around 75-90%. My winrates are very high because I'm reacting instead of predicting. Yes, this can technically still be considered predicting.\n7. **Day trading is gambling.** In my opinion day trading with a strategy is akin to playing blackjack but you're counting cards. If you have no strategy you're just playing a roulette wheel.\n\nThis is what reviewing your trades may look like: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLAr1Ryq-t8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLAr1Ryq-t8)", "created_utc": 1593581755.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hj49cu/day_trading_how_to_quicken_your_learning_curve/", "is_self": true}
