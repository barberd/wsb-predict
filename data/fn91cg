Didn\u2019t sell last Friday because I thought \ud83d\udc8e\u270a\ud83c\udffb would pull through this time. I need a bull to come keep me warm and give me some hope for the blood red Monday. Bought the calls on Wednesday when I saw some autistic DD about how SPY was projected to shoot up to 280 and thought I had struck it rich.\n\nDo I have any chance of breaking even now or is it over for my RH baby account? RH has treated me so well the last month even through its breakages and I hate to let go of the RH baby so soon (speaking of babies please change the logo back)\n\nI have learned to never listen to WSB again, with the peak autism reached in holding my calls I should be let into r/WSBelite\n\nI\u2019m thinking I either sell at a 60% loss come Monday on a dead bounce or diamond hands all the way through until the fated u/Variation-Separate BIG BOI bounce to 250ish.
