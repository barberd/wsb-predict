{"id": "dl7q76", "title": "$F for Ford?", "selftext": "Before I begin I want to say that $F has been a great learner's stock. The options are dirt fuckin' cheap and the stock itself has been relatively stable, leading to potentially great earnings on iron condors or whatever have you. I certainly wouldn't say you should buy their stock because I'm a Michigan boy and we've been burned by them one too many times to begin with, also this is WSB who the FUCK buys stocks these days when the tendies are in options?\n\nThat said I believe this upcoming earnings report on Wednesday (10/23) is the perfect opportunity for it to either rally or fall. It's been a very tough quarter for auto makers in the U.S. due to the strikes but that was mostly GM who took the brunt of the hit (hint: $GM 10/29). HOWEVER Ford itself is like the ugly kid on the play ground and despite everything his competitor's face he's the one who gets bullied by the chad stonk investors. \n\nToday it was downgraded by [some nerds](https://finance.yahoo.com/m/98f50487-0458-3227-9ed7-404245c16afe/ford-stock%3A-valuengine.html) from 'sell' to 'strong sell' but of course this isn't priced in to the earnings call. What prompted this was the botched release of some [boomer-mobile](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-botches-explorer-launch-putting-100000028.html) which is believed to drive the stock downward much further. This won't effect this quarter either, so be sure to put your puts in for next earnings.\n\nIt's been a shitty quarter for all automakers, but I think that will ultimately be Ford's best bet at a rally on Wednesday, as compared to their counterparts they've had a quite tame time. At the same time I don't trust them one single fuckin' bit to pull through. This quarter is make or break for the stock to get past 10$, or consign itself as a penny stock at sub $5.\n\nHaving mixed feelings, I'm running a strangle and hoping it goes down as the calls were less expensive than the puts and therefore I stand to earn more. If you're new and take the religious route of inversing WSB, an iron condor is what you want but if you're Iron Condor'ing on earnings week you definitely belong here.\n\nThat all being said, next earnings if they continue to have a rough time it'll definitely be worth considering some major OTM puts.", "created_utc": 1571695299, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dl7q76/f_for_ford/", "is_self": true}
