Its momentum has already started to die out, and while other MJ companies pumped and dumped and have sunk to the red, Aphria has remained green.\n\n**This is where Aphria comes into play; $APHA**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**They were sitting on 348 million in CASH back in march. CASH IS KING!**  \nThey will most likely have around  500 million by october.\n\nI think this can be an indication of who the market sees as the next lead bull.  Taking all of this together, I anticipate that Aphria will come close to its old highs during the summer, whereby a major sell off will be triggered for 1-3 months, as long-time bahholders will be tempted to let the bag go...\n\nThus allowing the stock to cool down somewhat and consolidate before the US election. Leading up to the election, the stock will likely pick up steam once more and if the democrats win or either presidential candidate announces a more pro-legalization policy, then we will break old highs and soar anywhere between $25-100$.. i know it sounds crazy but its entirely possible.  This is the most bullish prespective. Actual price target is minimum 6-7$ by october.\n\n\\*\\*But weed stonks are for fags and are all pump and dumps!\\*\\*Yep ! Most are. But if you look at the financials of aphria; i wont really bother to post them because most of you wont read it anyway,\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rxbwy9td71051.png?width=1597&format=png&auto=webp&s=59b6bb02f5b80df78c0c448e451646a189c8b5df\n\n\\*\\*What is comming up for the next few weeks?\\*\\*Canopy Growth and Hexo earnings are expected at the end of this month and start of june.This will give even more momentum to Aphria leading up to the earnings on **JULY 30th**\n\nAphria is one of the only 2 marijuana companies that have no debt and are actually making a profit while other shitty corps just keep losing millions every goddamn quarter. This stock is undervalued sitting below NAV. They literally selling shares to bigger investors for a PREMIUM compared to ACB and HEXO sellings shares BELOW market value !\n\nIf you believe i just want to pump the stock, you can also buy calls or shares of Canopy Growth or Hexo, they should get a nice little pump from the upcomming earnings aswell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# TLDR; BUY $APHA shares or calls, Strike 5c or more , expiry aroud October", "created_utc": 1590029417.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gnot4l/acb_is_pushing_the_mj_sector_up_its_not_too_late/", "is_self": true}
