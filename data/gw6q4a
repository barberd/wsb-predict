{"id": "gw6q4a", "title": "Donkey Kong and Nikolas: A Short Story", "selftext": "I remember the day my child Donkey Kong was born. The womb in which he was incubating, DEAC, changed one morning and suddenly there he was, my little baby Donkey Kong (DKNG for short). He was a relatively calm little guy in his embryo stages but he sure has grown since then. He grows, then I feed him more calls, and those also grow and grow relentlessly. He's been sleeping a lot the past couple of days. I think he was tired from all of the rampaging and destroying of bears' assholes he's been doing, but I'm sure he'll be back to his old ways soon.\n\nTomorrow I will welcome a new child into my home: baby Nikolas (NKLA for short). I can't wait to see little NKLA emerge from his VTIQ womb and see what he does once he arrives. I'm not sure if he's going to be as gregarious and successful as his big brother DKNG. By comparison, NKLA caused a lot of fuss in the embryo stage, and has been more of an attention seeker. He really scared me a couple of times early on when he grew fast but then shrunk a lot -- it was really fucked up, I thought I might lose him before he was ever born. But he hung in there and lately has become strong and healthy. We'll see if he will grow up to destroy bears' assholes like DKNG, but I'm not too sure. If he does not take to the RH teat quickly and starts to show signs of weakness, I might just give him up for adoption and use the adoption proceeds to buy more of the delicious DKNG calls that have brought so much joy to our home these past several weeks.\n\nThe end. \n\nIf anyone knows how the rest of the story might end up, please comment below.\n\nEdit: Grammar.", "created_utc": 1591231610.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gw6q4a/donkey_kong_and_nikolas_a_short_story/", "is_self": true}
