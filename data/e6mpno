Currently, the survey is for 184k, which is NEAR IMPOSSIBLE given how average NFPs have been 140k for the last year. Plus, we don't have the census hiring anymore, and even though it might be retail workers adding the bulk, that doesn't detract from the fact that hiring is weakening.\n\nSo weaker than expected NFPs - what does that mean for trading? Weaker might mean less cuts, so stocks up, but it also might mean economy is worse, so stocks down. I'm personally still doing call credit spreads so that means we're going for ATHs.", "created_utc": 1575576316, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e6mpno/nfp_fridays_previous_128k_survey_184k/", "is_self": true}
