{"id": "ermnes", "title": "FDX DD", "selftext": "This afternoon I had my handler drive me to a local FedEx warehouse so I that I could observe the volume of trucks that were going in and out. After sitting in the car with my binoculars for three hours I counted 21 very long trucks, 42 medium sized trucks, and 7 unmarked trucks potentially carrying new Raytheon technology. I\u2019m not sure how my numbers compare to other days because my handler said we won\u2019t ever do that again.\n\nThat being said I think FDX 2/7 165c is a very safe bet due to the current traffic that I witnessed today.", "created_utc": 1579567025, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ermnes/fdx_dd/", "is_self": true}
