One week earlier, I lost a family member. Quickly dwindled into a state where I didn\u2019t think I would ever go. \n\nJust 3 weeks ago, I was on top of the world, then an abrupt sudden stop to life. \n\nLife continued, being on the front lines seeing COVID patients everyday before my eyes and still to this day has been the most challenging thing I\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s been hard, thinking what I could I have done to make it up, relentlessly searching for DD\u2019s, it all feels so surreal. \n\nIf you\u2019ve been here, you know the feeling, and I\u2019ll always commit to helping people in a struggling phase in life, more so than outside my job. \n\nFrom here out, it\u2019s a road upwards, staying strong has been hard, days seem to go up and down, but reality is still hard. \n\nI\u2019ll be better because of this, and I\u2019ll always know how others have felt through the process. \n\nStay strong friends.  \n\n[https://imgur.com/gallery/GhnP7Cl](https://imgur.com/gallery/GhnP7Cl)", "created_utc": 1586907468.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1gkln/healthcare_worker_on_the_front_lines_lost_it_all/", "is_self": true}
