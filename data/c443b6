I had a lot of internship experience, none of it was that great, but because it included a PE firm (in ops) I thought I was set for a cushy ride to investments. I ended up as an FA and couldn't break out of that mold, so I decided to build a track record trading, like a dumbass.\n\nAt first, I was making a killing (\\~250-500 a day) basically screening fundamentally cheap stocks and looking for deviations in the technicals. My target was like 2-3% ROI on my trades, I wasn't chasing moons or lambos. My arrogant dumbass decided to listen to my friends and family however who pointed out how I kept \"selling too early\" and how I needed to \"play the table longer\". What they didn't realize is my strategy was also meant to reduce losses, not just to cap off gains, I guess my ego got too big for this though. I started trying to \"ride the wave\" a little longer and almost always got caught when it would break. I lost a lot very quickly, and my trading got a lot worse as desperation set it. Yoloing options and not being satisfied when my calls returned 2k because it just put me at breakeven.\n\nThank god I enrolled in the CFA program while doing this and I started blogging about fundamental analysis/financial modeling (real stuff that grown-ups do since no one cares about a guy who Yolos) and got a real job as a research analyst. I still trade a little bit for fun, but I always get a kick out of hearing about idiot's stories who also thought they were just financial educated and \"weren't gambling\". What've you guys got and how hard did the desperation curve kick you in the ass?", "created_utc": 1561294007, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c443b6/day_trading_whos_done_it_and_what_did_the_slope/", "is_self": true}
