{"id": "fapgss", "title": "Manipulating Markets", "selftext": "Prelude: The Dow Jones hit 25,000 for the first time on January 4th 2018.  On this day, the old white men of Wall Street busted out their celebratory \"DOW 25,000\" hats. These hats were completely irrelevant, until now.\n\nThesis: The Dow Jones was as high as 29,551 on February 12th; child labor in China were probably starting production on \"DOW 30000 HATS\". No way were they thinking that we would be closing in on 25000 within a couple weeks of that high. Because of this sudden event, and the fact people don't normally celebrate bad things happening, the only hats available on the market will be from an unopened 2 year old box. A quick search can show you that ebay and a few other sources still have these hats available. With very little supply, we could cause enough demand to skyrocket the price of these hats. \n\ntl;dr Buy 25000/20000 DOW hats before the supply is thin and prices skyrocket. \n\nBefore you ask:\n\nThere is no expiration. 20000 and 25000 strike will both print tendies. \n\nIf you decide to wear this amazing hat you will surely attract other gay bears to have butt sex with. \n\nThoughts?\n\n [https://www.zazzle.com/autistic\\_pride\\_infinity\\_hat-148716834135582813](https://www.zazzle.com/autistic_pride_infinity_hat-148716834135582813)", "created_utc": 1582865912, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fapgss/manipulating_markets/", "is_self": true}
