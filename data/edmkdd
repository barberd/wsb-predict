I have a few questions.\n\n[Last Column: Gain\\/Loss today](https://preview.redd.it/31la1ymnkx541.png?width=2064&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67b2c8200d02ab21ee8d02ec7080173eb1127f3a)\n\n1. I matched the options in price when I bought them. Now I see there are probably more ways to do it. Should I make sure the prices, absolute delta values, or change in the percentage of stock price to be the same?\n2. I checked their delta and found them to be about the same (due to similar strike prices I believe). See below, it seems to be there should be about a $4 difference for 1 contract each but the difference today turns out to be $14. Well unless it's just normal market irregularity. Much appreciated!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jtw5herslx541.png?width=973&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c35b2a6ce90d513f1815b9fdd91892d8f2f6df2\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/moyc0frslx541.png?width=1022&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f58e861b6f8034c7e19e86e86b3ec02b13b2ae2", "created_utc": 1576910303, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/edmkdd/bbby_straddle_somehow_not_balanced/", "is_self": true}
