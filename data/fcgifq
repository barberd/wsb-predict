Yay I know it sounds old school and boring but it\u2019d be a BIG fuck you to Robinhood. Since we are a small army of 900,000+ of degenerate retards. Getting #boycottrobinhood trending on twitter could bring bear season to their HQ. Its as simple as clicking like two buttons. I know you all can do it since you\u2019re all jacking off atm since you can\u2019t trade your lousy options because of Robinhood. Also yes this is in fundamentals since everyone should know not to use Robinhood. It should be common sense at this point. Please and thank you for your time and consideration. God speed to you all. \ud83d\ude4f\n\ntl;dr just tweet a hate statement and add \u201c#boycottrobinhood\u201d to the end. Thanks \ud83d\ude4f", "created_utc": 1583173856, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fcgifq/ok_tards_the_time_has_come_for_robinhood_please/", "is_self": true}
