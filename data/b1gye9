{"id": "b1gye9", "title": "No greeks or bid?", "selftext": "Okay probably a dumb question but since my calls expire today I want to find out whats happening. So like I said I have some calls expiring today (ACB 9.50) but none of the greeks are being displayed and I cant sell it for anything (even though it says contracts price is 0.03). Their also is no bid price which I find odd since there are 4,700 open interest. The options price has not fluctuated at all today even though ACB has moved over 5%. Any idea why this is?
