[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flhk4k/thoughts\\_on\\_tomorrow/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flhk4k/thoughts_on_tomorrow/) \n\nThe big players waited until markets closed to put in huge 3/23 call blocks. Sneaky\n\nSPX orders\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/87mf091dzvn41.png?width=1598&format=png&auto=webp&s=21cba5343fc5adffa8e9d04c198598400e03ea89\n\n[New positions](https://imgur.com/yHBjSGo) 3/23 236 calls.\n\nWhat's next after Monday?\n\nAfter today, a lot of big firms have finished deleveraging which means they will now play for the downside and short the market. It does, however, mean we might see more consecutive green days because firms now have to cover their shorts. Expect general downside slide with a few days of green in between. \n\nWhy is the overall market still bearish?\n\nThere is still a huge liquidity issue and a dash for dollar. Dollar remains strong and recovered the slight decline it had this morning, ending flat.\n\n[Dollar Index](https://www.investing.com/currencies/us-dollar-index-streaming-chart)\n\nAs talked about in my previous posts, and by u/separate-variation a lot of MM (which are not the banks anymore, but shadow firms) are getting liquidated and blown out. Today CME had a forced auction on a MM firm Ronin to liquidate all its assets. \n\n[Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/20/clearing-firm-ronin-capital-unable-to-meet-capital-requirements-at-cme-sources.html)\n\nThere will be more MM liquidation to come, in the US and all over the world. On top of that, Oil is still struggling, airline, cruise, energy industries are all struggling and needing bailout or facing bankruptcy. If and when they do get bailed out, there will be stock dilution which leads to more downside. \n\nThis will continue to happen until Fed changes lending policies or changes the law so they can directly aid leveraged MM firms. \n\nThere are so many other factors like more states locking down, and additional states joining them, possible Donny ordering a nationwide lockdown.\n\nSPY closed under 240 this week which has been a big support area, all signs pointing to much lower prices in the coming months.\n\nTL:DR there is a 100 million dollar bet after-hours Monday is green. If you're holding ITM puts through April and later, you are printing for sure. If you got no puts, load up on green days. 4/17 236p June 200p", "created_utc": 1584737294.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fm2gg7/shadow_wars_deleveraging_of_risk_and_a_sneaky/", "is_self": true}
