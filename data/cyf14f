And their latest actions support this hypothesis. \n\n(1) Orange man has an election to win. He needs time for the economy to grow and recover while campaigning and if the trade war does not end now or very soon, he will not have enough time. In the past, he has always used the stock market to justify his presidency. His resumption of raising tariffs during this time is no coincidence because of this time constraint. His latest actions have proven that he is getting desperate for a quick end to the trade war. His call to ban US companies from doing business with China demonstrates this.  His lies about the Chinese phone call also show that he is anxious about the effect the trade war is having on the stock market which both supports the importance he is placing on the stock market being linked to his political position, and his desperation. \n\n(2) the trade war threatens the CCP's political position. The CCP believes it derives its mandate to rule from the growing economy. It believes that a stable and growing economy reinforces a stable political environment in China. Therefore, it sees any economic threat as a political threat and the CCP's number one priority is to stay in power. For those of you who did not know, a lot of revolutions and revolts that have toppled and threatened dynasties throughout Chinese history have their beginnings in economic troubles. The reason China has delayed the trade war to the eve of the 2020 elections is to give itself a better bargaining position with Trump as he becomes more desperate. China does not want to wait until after the 2020 elections because if Trump were to win, he would be in a better position for negotiations. If the Democrats were to win, there would be no guarantee that they would easier to negotiate than Trump and it is likely the Democrats would not end the trade war without concessions that Trump was seeking due to similar national security concerns that transcend party lines. Furthermore, the CCP is wary of the economic havoc Trump would exact if the CCP refuses to end the trade war before the elections. Therefore, not ending the trade war before the elections bring considerable risk to the CCP's political position. The latest Hong Kong protests have not helped at all in this regard. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Bear gang about to get slaughtered.", "created_utc": 1567369323, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cyf14f/why_the_trade_war_will_be_ending_very_soon/", "is_self": true}
