What ideas do you have on this?\n\nHere are mine:\n\nFolder feature: Allow user to group a bunch of positions in a 'folder'. This way I can put my distant options / dividend paying safe stock in folders so i can focus on my week to week BS. Folder would display value of contents each day.\nFor example, I have to scroll past my CRON, CGC, PFE long positions that I'm not touching to find my SPY puts and weekly calls.\n\n\n\nDividend notification: when you receive dividends/coupons, display a treasure chest that the user clicks on and have the money jump out. This way you see your dividends happen. (Actual money is received in the normal way, the notification is just cooler)\n\nAchievements: Add achievements for various things like getting 100, 200, 300, 1000 % gains also for owning various types of positions or executiing different trades. This will encourage people to learn about different kinds of cool things, like buying up BB- bonds. This way you can have a score (I have a ton of cool ideas for the achievements and would love to work with any brokerage that wants to consult with me on this idea)\n\nFD YOLO Button: have automatic YOLO button where you enter a dollar amount, and your PRT, and it automatically buys liquid OTM options on something with an upcoming event expiring very soon within your stated PRT. (For example, if you have a $300 you can place a trade with a chance of getting $600 or zero w/o knowing the underlying stock)\n\nExercise button: Have a button/right click on options to excercize them.\n\nPersonal Loans: allow users to loan other users money and track defaults within app.\n\nAutomatic anti-retardation feature: allow users to lock themselves out of certain stocks for certain amounts of time to prevent doubling down on shitty stocks.\n\nHave a weighted indicator of who is buying what:\nBasically, using your annual returns, assign each user a score as to their Skills and PRT (sorta like a sharpe ratio) then if a bunch of people are buying a stock, lets us see if those people are autists who lose money or smart people who make money, this way we can follow the money makers.", "created_utc": 1575015632, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e3bzye/what_features_would_you_most_like_to_see/", "is_self": true}
