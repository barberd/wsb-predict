Don't PM me, plenty of people can help you in here. Options are **speculative,** they are the best and worst thing in the stock market. Options will make you stay up for days on end, make your weekends less fun as you wait for the glorious bell on Monday, but also put a lot of stress on you at times. **Do not try to talk to your friends about this shit unless they're in the industry,** they won't get it, and they'll think you're purely gambling (which, *we are*) and as a result -- will make you feel worse. Come to this sub once you start trading for your fix. ***This thread is for your benefit, just read it, autist (more about this friendly term we use shortly). Never invest more than you can afford to use, none of this is investment advice, learn at your own risk.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the daily discussion threads I've seen multiple newcomers to options/equities post questions about things that they should **DEFINITELY** know before putting capital on the line. Sometimes, even in reply to me saying they 'have the same position but don't know what will happen'.\n\n**I know that we troll a lot in this sub** \\-- but it doesn't mean we want people to come in, blow up their tax return, or worse their savings, and then have a hell of a time trying to get it back, never get sex from their wife/gf/bf/(insert whatever term you use in today's fucked up social environment) again, or end up on welfare because of options.\n\n# Get Cocky, Get Cucked\n\nOptions will fuck you. Literally, dry dog, federal pound me in the ass prison.\n\n[https://imgur.com/H13Jc54](https://imgur.com/H13Jc54)\n\nI've seen multiple people do this and post the loss porn, even some that had to go as far as to call gambling helplines. I'm making this post, whether it's received well by the community or not, to help anybody that shows up in the next week/month/year at least have their sea legs before they get going.\n\nIs this all available on Google? Absolutely. The fact is many people get into options after finding this sub and seeing gains porn, and then fantasizing about it being them. So let's post it here, again, for the new batch of inductees to the Autism Hall of Fame**\u2122** . Expect to lose every single dollar you put in the market. When you win, count your blessings, and pull out.\n\nAnyway, strap your helmets on, let's go.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# We Call Each Other Names - Get Over It\n\nThis sub is absolutely not for everybody, especially if you're sensitive to words or can't understand sarcasm. We call each other autistic because to be good at this, you have to have it on some level. Emotions have to mean nothing to you, although I get emotionally invested in positions, the more you can take this out of play, the better off you'll be in the long run.\n\nSitting at a 10% loss with a lot more downside and almost zero upside? Don't try to get it back. This isn't blackjack where you play one more hand and get even. This is fucking roulette, where you throw it all on red and 0 comes. Take your -10%, and find a new position.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Few commonly used terms around here:**\n\nFD - Faggy D's, faggot's delight, etc. Normally the closest expiration for an option, less than 5 days to expiration, the ultimate YOLO, what ever you want to call it. Rarely work out, but when they do it's better than sex.\n\nAutist(s) - All of us\n\nShkreli - Our savior\n\nMusk/Tusk/Elon - Savior number two\n\nOrange man - Trump\n\nVaseline - What you need when you buy FD's\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Absolute Fucking Basics - Options Pricing\n\nIt's jaw dropping some people don't even understand this part, but... it only takes a second, so start here: You'll see a lot of people talk about their options contracts in cents/dollars cents (0.83, 1.22, 5.15). Multiply those numbers by 100, since options entitle you to a lot of 100 shares of the underlying security to get the true cost, then multiply that by the number of contracts.\n\nExample: 0.50 contract = ($50 per contract X number of contracts) + Commissions = Cost of your trade. If you're like most the autists here and use Robinhood, you don't have the commission part, but it doesn't mean you necessarily always ***save anything,*** although fill rates have gotten better -- the spread can still fuck you.\n\nAlso: Your breakeven at expiration is rarely the strike price you paid for the option, spreads not withstanding. It is the current stock price, plus the option premium.\n\n***Example:*** Stock FaggyD's sits at $50. $50 Call option is $1.00, at expiration if the stock is at $51.00 or over, you win (buy some popcorn and tendies), for put options, it's $49.00 or less on the same pricing level.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# ELI5: The Greeks - Most Important Concept To Grasp Before Playing Options\n\nThe next thing that absolutely **BLOWS MY MIND** is the amount of people that do not understand the Greeks. There are ***NUMEROUS*** resources to learn about them (even on here).\n\nLet's cover them all in simple terms, and if something doesn't make sense, ask a question or research it more before you strap on a helmet...\n\nEach platform, whether it's ToS (thinkorswim), RobinHood, TastyWorks, etc. will provide you a set of numbers about a certain options contract. These are the Greeks. Since a lot of newcomers here use Robinhood, here's what they look like on an option below the \"Stats\" section (which we will cover shortly):\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/rv3rbxg.png](https://i.imgur.com/rv3rbxg.png)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, let's go over each Greek individually. All of the Greeks are anticipated values, or theoretical in nature, do not always exactly correspond to what will happen, but what is modeled and believed to occur. If you're a math geek like myself, read up on the various models (Black Scholes, Binomial, etc.) to get a feel for this even better. Other factors (such as implied volatility, covered later) can affect these values.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Theta** \\- I listed this first because it is probably the most important one. **Theta is a measure of time decay.** Time decay is your worst enemy if you're long. If you don't know what long means - you need to go to Investopedia and come back later. Theta is normally negative for long options, and positive for short (credit) positions. Let's take an example:\n\n***Example***: Option is at 1.00. Theta is .01 with 45 days to expiration. This means that tomorrow, theoretically, it's modeled that your option contract will be worth one dollar less (0.99) if NOTHING ELSE CHANGES. At 45 days and in, Theta starts to ramp, or increase. Theta is the reason that most options expire worthless, next to IV crush and just flat out being wrong (and you will be, faggot).\n\nNext day, the option is worth 0.98, assuming all is same. Then 0.97, etc. At some point, this theta value will increase. Then you'll start losing two, three, five, seven dollars per day, until the day before when time value will go to 0.\n\nThis is the reason options with longer expiration dates are more expensive -- time value. Theta affects longer dated expirations (90-120-180-365 days out) much less, than ones that expire this Friday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Delta/Gamma** \\- This is second in line because it is the next most important factor to an option's price. Delta is once again, a theoretical number that designates **how much an option contract is expected to appreciate or depreciate for a $1.00 movement in the underlying security**. Gamma is directly related to Delta, and is the theoretical amount that the DELTA will increase for the same change.\n\n***Example:*** TSLA is at $284.84 as of the time of writing this.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/M3QXFnd.png](https://i.imgur.com/M3QXFnd.png)\n\nThis example is rooted in real math, if it's complicated, read it a few times, and ask fucking questions.\n\nThis is an image of the $280 call option. It's currently priced at $37.35, or $3735 per contract. Theta is at -0.1694, or around -0.17, or $17 per contracts. Delta is at 0.5898 or around 0.59 or $59 per dollar change in TSLA's stock. Now, how can you correlate these two? Well, we know that tomorrow, our contract, if TSLA does not move and nothing else changes, should be around $17 (.17 x 100) less, or $3718.\n\nTo offset this cost, you will need Tesla to increase. How much? Well, an easy way to figure this is to divide the theta, .17 or $17, by the delta, .59 or $59. This results in 0.28, which is actually the amount of dollars we need it to increase. If Tesla is at 285.12 at close, you'll have out ran the theta, theoretically.\n\n**This also means that the Delta will have increased.** In the image you see the gamma is .0045. This means the Delta SHOULD increase to: .5898 + (.0045 per dollar x .28 cents = .0013) = .5911 for the next dollar increase in stock price past $285.12.\n\nThat's a lot of math, but the takeaway is that the **closer to the money an option, the bigger the delta and likely**, smaller the gamma. Gains to delta decrease as you increase/surpass the strike, and vice versa.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Vega** \\- While the others are important for making decisions to enter, and this one is as well, this is also a great indicator of when to exit. **Vega is directly related to implied volatility, and is the expected amount that the options contract is expected to change per 1% point change in the IV.** Implied Volatility, in basic terms is a bullshit number that does NOT correlate to how much a stock price is expected to swing, it is simply a modeled volatility that designates how swingy a certain option/the underlying security are in relation to each other. Why is it bullshit? Because **IV is ALWAYS overstated,** IE: You're paying more than the historical averages of volatility for a stock because of it. This is where a lot of the premium in options comes from, why net option sellers normally win, and people who lose normally ride the cuck train.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Example:*** IV on the same option as before. Let's say TSLA has a swingy day, or is approaching earnings. They IV is likely to go up. Let's say TSLA just reported earnings or somehow is trading sideways for a week or two (this never happens with TSLA), the IV will go down.\n\nIV on that option is 56.83%. Vega is .5929 or $59. If IV goes up to 57.83%, your option should increase by .59. Simple enough. IV goes down, it goes down accordingly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Rho** \\- This is the fifth and most forgotten Greek. It comes into play much less often, but straight from the Goog:  **Rho** is the rate at which the price of a derivative changes relative to a change in the risk-free rate of interest.\n\nNot going into much more detail there, but more valuable options have a higher Rho, and lower valued ones, a lower one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Next Most Important Thing: IV Crush/Ramp-Up\n\nSince many of us autists around here play earnings - it's important to know basic relationships about IV.\n\n**The higher the IV raises in an upward trend, the Vega will decrease LESS for each successive point.**\n\n**This means you gain more value in an option going from 30% --&gt; 50% IV, than going from 50% --&gt; 70% IV, and even less for 70% --&gt; 90%.**\n\n**Vice versa: During decreasing volatility, you lose the least value from 70% --&gt; 50%.**\n\n**You lose the most value from 50% --&gt; 30%.**\n\n*How can you use this to your advantage?* In low volatility environments (further out from earnings, long before major news or important dates) you can buy an option. Pending that news and the price swinging, as long as the IV outruns the stock price changes or it changes in unison in the direction you want, you will have a net gain. Many people buy options further out from earnings, ride the ramp up and subsequent (normally) increase in stock price if you're on a stock with good outlook/guidance from the previous quarter, **and can sell the contracts BEFORE earnings,** appreciating solely off the IV. This is IV ramp up.\n\n*On the other hand,* IV crush occurs when the earnings come out, price stabilizes and your option decreases drastically in value from the IV drop, and doesn't gain enough in price from the Delta in order to outrun the negative Vega and Theta situation you now find yourself in.\n\n**To avoid IV affecting the price of your options as much,** you can buy longer dated contracts (60, 90, 120), but do know that normally, they'll have a smaller delta, but also much smaller theta. This means your gains are lower, and risk is lower (you can normally get out of the longer contracts and sell to close easier with less loss than something that's 5% out of the money and closes in 5-10 days and just got bent over by IV crush).\n\nThis is where strategies diverge for various people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Some Basic Options Strategies\n\nSome people are fine YOLO'ing on an option expiring end of this week because they hope the price will increase enough to offset various things. Some people YOLO and just sell right at market open (watch pre-market pricing on NASDAQ or MarketWatch, whatever if you don't have a broker software to view it in). Some people sell before earnings. Some wait for the earnings peak, and go short (write/sell credit position) on the contracts to now profit off the resulting IV crush/Theta if they think the stock gapped up too much. Some just buy deep ITM calls because they have no balls /s.\n\nLet's cover the basics:\n\n* **I think the stock's going up, earnings aren't coming:** Buy long calls, give yourself enough time for the stock to actually increase to the strike or breakeven.\n* **I think the stock's going down:** Buy long puts, same as above, pay attention to theta, expiration, and IV of said option. IV affects puts the same as calls.\n* **I think the stock will trade sideways:** This is where spreads enter. I won't cover them much in this thread, I'll save that for next time, but things like iron condors, shorting out of the money calls/puts, taking advantage of theta decay come into play. Don't start writing/shorting/selling (whatever term you want to use) until you have a really good feel for what the fuck you're doing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Spreads: Basics - Avoid These Until Comfortable\n\nSpreads involve buying/selling a contract(s) at one price, and  buying/selling a contract(s) at other strikes, to result in capped gains/losses, or capped downside, or capped upside with increased probability of winning. This is one of the only ways to actually put yourself in a NET +EV (expected value) position in options unless you have very strong convictions that turn out to be right, which, in all reality was likely luck anyway. If you've gotten this far and really want to learn about spreads, I can always write a primer on a few. Here's the basics on a couple:\n\n* **Call credit spread: When you don't think the stock price will increase enough to hit strikes you're dealing with:** You use this spread by selling a normally at the money or slightly in the money/out of the money option, and buying one just above it. **What this does is create a net credit to your account.** You will still have to post some collateral/buying power to execute this trade since it has a downside to the trade that has to be covered.\n\n***Example:*** You sell the ATM, $10 strike call option for $1 a contract on a $10 underlying. You buy the $0.50 option at a $11 strike just above it. **The breakeven on this trade is $10.50,** the credit you received. Above that at expiration, you lose, because the contract you shorted has more value than the credit you've received at expiration. **If the call options BOTH expire worthless, you've made your maximum profit,** which is the credit you got on the original net sale. **Your max loss is realized once the price of the stock reaches the call contract you bought above the one you sold,** as that's the most the contract you sold can appreciate before the one you are long on starts to ramp up with intrinsic value.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Call debit spread: When you want to go long and reduce cost basis, but as a result, you will have capped profits:** This one is used when you want to bet on a stock increasing with lower cost basis, but as a result, capped upside.\n\n***Example:*** Stock is at $10. You buy the $9 call for $1.50. Normally, your breakeven will be $10.50. However, in this case you sell the $11 call for $0.50 (totally manufactured numbers for simplicity) to reduce your cost basis to $1 on the $9 call. This means that now your breakeven price is actually $10, and your cost basis is only $1. Let's say the price goes to $11.50 at expiration, you will have made $1.50, instead of the original $1 you would have by being on a basic one leg call. **However, you've also capped your profits.** Beyond $11.50, the call you sold will *also* increase, so your max profit on this trade at expiration is $1.50, while your **max loss is the debit you paid to enter it,** because worst case both expire worthless. On this trade you would have made 1.50/1 = \\~150% by using the spread, versus a single leg call purchase netting you $1/$1.50 = 66%, and you also have less downside exposure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Various others:** Put credit spread, put debit spread (you'll often hear the spreads above and these two referred to as vertical spreads, also), iron condor, spread, straddle, strangle, put, butterfly, trump's vagina, downward dog, whatever the fuck you want to call it. You can even modify these and create your own that has a lot more upside than downside, a smaller spread, etc. all depending on what you expect the underlying to do. Spreads are great tools when used right. Often, you can find spreads on certain underlyings that offer you a positive expected outcome, such as 60% of the time profiting $100 or 30% of the time losing $120. If you don't understand how to do the math there: (60% x 100) - (30% x 120) = 60 - 36 = $24 per trade executed on metrics I just described. If your cost basis in the trade is, let's say, $120, that's a 20% ROI each time. Make 100 of those trades, and your expected return is $2400. Depending on how you run versus the expected value, you can make more, or less, obviously.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think for now, that's enough. This should get you started thinking in the right terms. If anybody has anything to add that they think I should modify into this post, feel free to comment and I'll edit it in.\n\nIf not: Strap your helmets on bois, we're going to the moon.
