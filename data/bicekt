{"id": "bicekt", "title": "You kids wanna hear a tale...? A tale of an autist discovering himself. I give you... the tale of /u/joco645", "selftext": "Feb 7: The legend known as \"joco\" joins Reddit to ask [r/pennystocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks) if he should invest his entire life savings ($15k) into a Shrimp Company \n\nFeb 14: T.L.K.A.joco exits SHMP at a $50 loss. But the lil guys can do no wrong so he's back in soon after!\n\nFeb 19-25: T.L.K.A.J spends time handing out good advice on [r/pennystocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks). \n\nFeb 26: T.L.K.A.J brags about dat SHMP and the upcoming harvest report. For you city slickers that's like an ER except dipping sauce is provided.\n\nFeb 27: Uh oh. Panic selling in SHMP. But not to fear, the harvest report will provide \"logic and reason\" to the penny-stock shrimp-catchin' market\n\nFeb 27: T.L.K.A.J demands that the internet release the SHMP harvest report. \n\nMar 3: The harvest report came and nothing happened! In an illiquid penny stock! What?! How?! \n\nMar 4: T.L.K.A.J is calling SHMP a criminal scam.\n\nMar 5: T.L.K.A.J posts about another penny stock, cautioning his colleagues that \"huge news\" might not always result in price movements. Joco almost (ALMOST!) achieves a moment of self-awareness\n\nMar 14-15: T.L.K.A.J goes balls deep in ADBE and TSLA. Like the great Viking warriors of old, he dies on the battlefield and joins his ancestors in Yolo Valhalla. \n\nMar 16: T.L.K.A.J takes out a cash advance and now \"technically\" has 5k again! He's back to a good starting point if we don't count his student loans or cash advance as debt. Truly the trader of our time.\n\nMar 17-31: T.L.K.A.J makes back an astonishing 50% of what he started with. He has officially earned the title of professional analyst and is spewing advice on WSB from both ends!!! Net value of over $7,000 not counting a $5000 cash advance and neglecting to say we started with $15k.\n\nApr 1-25: T.L.K.A.J \"accidentally bought DIS puts after posting about how DIS was going down. After DIS goes up T.L.K.A.K reveals his long con: He meant to buy calls, but the pesky app changed it on him. It all happened so fast.\n\nApr 26-28: T.L.K.A.J doubles down that he is a good investor. Refuses to take advice and states he will look into a second cash advance. He can't afford to lose what he's lost, so he's withdrawing more money to try and make it back.\n\nGod speed our young autist.\n\nCredit to /u/lilgeckojr", "created_utc": 1556465457, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bicekt/you_kids_wanna_hear_a_tale_a_tale_of_an_autist/", "is_self": true}
