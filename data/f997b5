{"id": "f997b5", "title": "Buy SPCE calls today - DD inside", "selftext": "So here is my hypothesis for why you should buy SPCE calls today \n\n- Inexplicably, when everything else was risk off yesterday, SPCE ended up green. This means there are serious buyers out there (not just autists from WSB) keeping this piece of shit alive. Volume was quite high on SPCE yesterday also, so this isint some weak ass price move \n\n- There was a closed door conference last week for some select investors with the CEO - clearly they know something. \n\n- Earnings release tonight, but this is honestly immaterial because whatever they say is just going to be some sort of long term story; basically a pretty deck with pictures. Market will eat that shit up\n\n- I am all in on Fri 27 PUTS, reversing my decisions is a 100% proven full proof strategy\n\nEnjoy your tendies and please thank me later. \ud83d\udc3bs sorry love you guys, I will forever be bear gang even if I am bankrupt but this is just the way", "created_utc": 1582631942, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f997b5/buy_spce_calls_today_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
