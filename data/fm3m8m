Which is true, but it took me exploring options to do the actual learning.\n\nIf you want to make money: Options.\n\nIf I was your coach, I'd say start running. Learn in the process. Don't exceed what you are not willing to part from, but the best way to learn is by doing, especially if you are like me who needs a hands-on approach. And I'm very handsy.\n\nI've lost a LOT of money on options in the beginning. But I went in knowing that could be the outcome. I'm more familiar because I took the leaps, and risks, and now, I'm ready for the most volatile market in our current memory. Who knows what's next.\n\nYou know what a fugazi is?\n\nToo Short/Need to read more:\n\nAs a designer, there's an anecdote from an old professor who challenged students on the success of creative outcomes: Half the class was ordered to create 1 piece of pottery with thoughtful planning and execution. The other half of the class was to submit as many pots as possible...\n\nGuess who made the better pots...\n\nThe ones who practiced by trial and error. The ones who learned about the temperature of the kilm. The consistency of the clay. The way the pot 'felt'. Those who spent time fucking around, trying out this temperature, or this consistency, or this 'feel', ended up with structurally sound pieces of art, that were ready for the most important aspect of art: selling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Takeaway for those too dense to understand the comparison... Those who practice get it. Those who spend too much time calculating, trying to find the perfect play, don't.\n\n[https://imgur.com/K6cTh5h](https://imgur.com/K6cTh5h)\n\nPositions: EWQ 24p 4/17, SPY 200p 5/15, EUOc 33c 5/15, SPCE 11.5p 4/3\n\nEdit 2: Love the 'beginner posts' comments. Just FYI, I design whitepapers for Forbes and NYL Investments, so maybe that gives me an edge? I dunno. My all-time is not much further out than 1.5 months, so you're pretty much seeing my 'all-time'", "created_utc": 1584741462.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fm3m8m/fuck_those_who_said_take_your_time_before_doing/", "is_self": true}
