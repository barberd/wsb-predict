Monday\u2019s rally put the S&amp;P 500 back into positive territory for 2020, and the projected gain for the Dow at the Tuesday open should do the same. Dow futures are currently projecting a 300+ point gain at the open. The Dow needs about 460 more points to erase that Friday slide. (CNBC)\n* The lone economic report out today comes at 10 a.m. ET, when the government issues December factory orders. Though a busy morning for earnings will see the latest numbers from Centene (CNC), Clorox (CLX), McKesson (MCK), Ralph Lauren (RL), Royal Caribbean (RCL) and Sirius XM (SIRI), among others.\n* Dow component Walt Disney (DIS) grabs the after-the-bell earnings spotlight, with Ford Motor (F), Aflac (AFL), Allstate (ALL), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Match Group (MTCH), Seagate Technology (STX) and Snap (SNAP) also among those releasing quarterly numbers. (CNBC)\n* Google parent company Alphabet\u2019s (GOOGL) shares slid 3% the premarket despite beating earnings estimates for the fourth quarter, as the company came in light on revenue. The tech giant did break out numbers for its YouTube and cloud businesses for the first time, though the disclosure was limited in scope. (CNBC)\n* Google still isn\u2019t telling us about a key metric for YouTube and cloud: Profits (CNBC)\n* Shares of Tesla (TSLA) soared nearly 20% in Monday\u2019s trading after Argus Research raised its price target and short-sellers scrambled to catch up to the stock. The move was the biggest one-day jump since May, 2013. In Tuesday\u2019s premarkets, Tesla stock was trading up nearly 3.4%. (CNBC)\n* Results from the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses were delayed until later today as the state\u2019s Democratic Party said a \u201creporting issue\u201d caused \u201cinconsistencies\u201d in some data. The top 2020 contenders (including Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren) will now focus on the New Hampshire primary one week from today. (CNBC)\n* Buttigieg claims victory in Iowa caucuses, though no results have been released (CNBC)\n* President Donald Trump will be unleashing \u201crelentless optimism\u201d during his third State of the Union address tonight, a speech designed to pivot from his impeachment to his drive for reelection. The theme of his speech: \u201cThe Great American Comeback.\u201d (AP)\n* The Republican-led Senate is poised to acquit Trump in a vote tomorrow afternoon. Yesterday\u2019s closing arguments offered Dems an opportunity to leave the viewing public with two final thoughts: Trump\u2019s actions were craven and corrupt, and that Trump still presents a clear danger to both national security and the integrity of the 2020 presidential election. (CNBC)\n* Hong Kong\u2019s Hospital Authority told CNBC that a 39-year-old man died this morning in the city\u2019s first death related to the coronavirus outbreak. This would be the second known death outside of mainland China. Chinese health officials said earlier that in mainland China the total now sits at 425 deaths and 20,438 confirmed cases.\n* No, garlic won\u2019t protect you from coronavirus: WHO pushes back on rampant misinformation (CNBC)\n* Coronavirus will likely become a pandemic, warns ex-FDA chief Scott Gottlieb (CNBC)\n* Goldman Sachs (GS) is in talks to offer small business loans to merchants on Amazon\u2019s (AMZN) sprawling e-commerce platform. The deal, if closed, would mark the second tech giant using Goldman as a back-end provider of bank-regulated services. (CNBC)\n* The FTC said it plans to sue to block Edgewell\u2019s $1.37 billion acquisition of shaving start-up Harry\u2019s, citing competition concerns in the consumer shaving space. The deal, announced last May, would give Edgewell access to Harry\u2019s data and subscription base. For Harry\u2019s, it would provide a platform through which to expand beyond its nine factories. (CNBC)\n* Influential right-wing talk radio host Rush Limbaugh announced on his program that he has been diagnosed with \u201cadvanced lung cancer.\u201d Limbaugh, 69, said he will take time off his normal broadcast schedule to seek treatment. Last night, Trump tweeted about Limbaugh\u2019s diagnosis, calling the host \u201ca great guy &amp; fantastic political talent,\u201d and wishing him \u201ca speedy recovery.\u201d (CNBC)\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](http://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/publish/020420/sec_all_074633996.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jrjebSl.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/1Y2OpqS.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/eVWWwMR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/q77vHiR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/pQNRK2N.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/VzNhwDy.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS AFTERNOON'S POST-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\nT.B.A.\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/7usu9rV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/sUcLOoy.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/RxUY2Pk.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/dTNMp4k.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/1EqsZXm.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/Dce2Kpe.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/ZEQ34Hy.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/is4t4wI.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS:\n\n* TSLA\n* DIS\n* GOOGL\n* GOOG\n* BP\n* F\n* CNC\n* CLX\n* ETN\n* SPG\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/04/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-clorox-mckesson-sirius-xm-alphabet-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Clorox (CLX)** \u2013 The household products maker beat estimates by 15 cents a share, with quarterly earnings of $1.46 per share.
