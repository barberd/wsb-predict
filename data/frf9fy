Oil futures dropped big at open tonight, down over 6%, and is now hovering right at $20 and will likely be in the teens by tonight or early this week. \n\nWith the explosion of cases now occurring in the United States...this week will be hell. Trump extended social distancing until the end of April. As more cases explode we will see even more of a disruption than we already have in global supply chains which are in absolute dismay right now. We\u2019re now on the second leg down to print a new bottom. \n\nFYI: 15 days to slow the spread was announced on March 16th. We had 4,132 cases that day. 14 days later and we have 137,459 cases and growing. Let that sink in.\n\nMy price targets are SPY $163 and TSLA $150-$200 by May 15th. Laugh all you want, I\u2019m sure you would of laughed at me if I told you TSLA was going to be trading in the $350\u2019s only 34 days after it hit $968. So fuck you bulls.\n\nI have a lot of other technicals that I\u2019m using and I\u2019ll be updating throughout the week. \n\nAll my puts are on SPY, TSLA, and SPX for June 19th.", "created_utc": 1585522867.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frf9fy/you_dumb_autists_update/", "is_self": true}
