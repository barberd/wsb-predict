Trump waited until after the meeting to announce this, obviosly dissappointed with the small cuts. While this alone would be plausible, if you consider that SA just bought up CCL to hell and back it seems a little bit more than coincidence. Since Trump can't force shale producers to cut production he is going to use this ban during negotiations to squeeze SA into cutting oil production.", "created_utc": 1586633599.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fzfx8s/the_cruise_ban_is_leverage_against_opec/", "is_self": true}
