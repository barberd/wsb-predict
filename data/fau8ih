I gave my credit card to my girlfriend and she went out with her boyfriend, bought me the biggest strap-on they could find at Spencer's. I think they might've hit Lululemon and chipotle as well but I'm not sure, she doesn't talk to me much. \n\nThe point is, after fully accepting and committing to the fact that I am a massive gay \ud83d\udc3b, I think I might actually make enough money tomorrow to move out of my mom's basement. \n\nIf any of you really think the institutional investors are gonna hold their shit through this weekend then you're actually retarded. Try to convince me otherwise, I'll be waiting. BUY PUTS\n\nEdit: I know I won't get Modelo flu because my asshole has been stretched to the point of incontinence by 3/20 MSFT $200 calls, so anything in my system is getting flushed right out", "created_utc": 1582894228, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fau8ih/it_happened/", "is_self": true}
