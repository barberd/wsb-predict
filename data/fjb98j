{"id": "fjb98j", "title": "Montana closes all schools", "selftext": "The state of Montana has been put into a state of emergency, all school has been canceled for two weeks. The universities are all online. Big Sky resort just closed for the season, as well as most of the other ski resorts in the whole state. Big Sky also has something called Yellowstone Club (google tards) and many of the worlds ultra-wealthy and powerful are retreating here to wait it out. They are flocking out of the cities in their private jets just so they can wait in the seclusion of their club. \n\nOne issue for some of the more rural states is that the healthcare systems are so weak. Even though no one lives here and everyone lives in the middle of buttfuck nowhere, the states in our area happen to produce a lot of the nation's food and are generally not the healthiest of people. People here still don't realize how bad it will get, one school near me canceled their prom, so the parents decided to hold their own prom for the kids. Holy fucking retarded.  The only people more autistic than the ones on this sub are the rest of the people in the country. The world is ending, there will be blood this week. \n\nTL;DR: DIS 80p 3/20, DIS 90p 3/20, DIS 94p 3/20, AAL 10p 2/37, DAL 42p 3/27, MGM 16p 4/3,  GILD 78c 4/3, SPY 250p 4/8, F 5.5p 4/9, LYV 30p 4/17, ACWI 61p 4/17\n\nThe mouse's head will roll this week.", "created_utc": 1584316535.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjb98j/montana_closes_all_schools/", "is_self": true}
