{"id": "gfl5lg", "title": "If BKNG doesn't tank from this ER, never short in this market.", "selftext": "You will be hard pressed to find a major company that has been harder hit than BKNG, and gave a worse outlook than BKNG during their ER.\n\nAs of close today, ***BKNG is only down 31% from early January highs***, and only 15% down from 2/28.  If this sucker doesn't tank tomorrow morning from the BKNG CEO's comments and outlook, you should never short in this market.\n\n# Q1 Results and Expectations\n\n[Estimate Consensus from Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BKNG/analysis?p=BKNG)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Q1 2020|Earnings (EPS)|Revenue|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Estimates**|||\n|No of Analysts|28|27|\n|Avg Estimate|**$6.10**|$2.31B|\n|Low Estimate|($2.86)|$1.62B|\n|High Estimate|$10.02|$2.75B|\n|Year Ago EPS|$11.17|$2.84B|\n|Sales Growth Est||\\-18.70%|\n||||\n|**Actuals**|**$3.77 Non-GAAP**|$2.30B|\n||($17.01) GAAP||\n\nIt was a huge miss on Non-GAAP earnings, but they still made a profit.  About ($11.86) of that difference between Non-GAAP and GAAP EPS is due to a non-cash impairment writedown of goodwill from the KAYAK and OpenTable acquisitions.  This is important because it shows how management views the future.  I would strongly argue that most investors should take that impairment into account.\n\nFor those of you who don't know, goodwill impairment write downs generally occur when management believes that the value of an acquistion is not recoverable.   That means that management believes that the financial outlook over several years for OpenTable and KAYAK has decreased to the point where the initial acquisition price is no longer worth it.  You write down when the companies will never make the profit required to justify the acquisition price.\n\n# [From the 10-Q](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1075531/000107553120000027/bkng3312010q.htm) (and described on the call):\n\n>***Newly-booked room night reservations, excluding the impact of cancellations, have been declining as the COVID-19 pandemic has spread, and decreased by over 85% in April 2020 as compared to April 2019.*** In addition, ***we expect our revenue will be impacted to a greater extent*** considering the impact of cancellations in March for April stays and also since many hotels, especially in Europe, were not open in April. We expect to continue to see ***severely reduced new travel and restaurant reservation bookings as compared to 2019 levels for the foreseeable future***, which will have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, given the volatility in global markets and the financial difficulties faced by many of our travel service provider and restaurant partners, we have increased our provision for expected credit losses on receivables from and cash advances made to our travel service provider and restaurant partners.  \n>  \n>Due to the uncertain and rapidly evolving nature of current conditions around the world, we are unable to predict accurately the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business going forward. We currently expect, however, that ***the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our financial performance for the quarter ended June 30, 2020, much more significantly than it impacted the quarter ended March 31, 2020***, primarily because an increasing number of markets and locations will have been subject to the governmental measures and economic disruptions noted above during the entirety of the second quarter (as compared to the first quarter, when the effects of the outbreak were largely limited to China and certain other Asian markets during January 2020 and much of February 2020).\n\n***Revenue is down 85% for all of April.***  From the call, management doesn't expect May and future months to trend much better.  Q2 is going to be far worse that Q1.\n\n**From the call, management currently expects a long, drawn out recovery for BKNG to take years.**  They do mean years in their expectations too, as you can see from how the evaluated goodwill impairment on KAYAK and OpenTable.\n\n# Goodwill Impairment from the 10-Q\n\n>We review long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that ***the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.***  The assessment of possible impairment is based upon the ability to recover the carrying value of the assets from the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, before interest and taxes, of the related asset group. Due to the significant and negative financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we performed the recoverability test of our long-lived assets and concluded there was no impairment at March 31, 2020.  \n>  \n>We test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. We test goodwill at a reporting unit level.  Our annual goodwill impairments tests are performed as of September 30. Due to the significant and negative financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we performed an interim period goodwill impairment test at March 31, 2020. Under the current goodwill impairment standard adopted in the first quarter of 2020, a goodwill impairment loss is measured at the amount by which a reporting unit\u2019s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill (see Note 1 to our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements).  \n>  \n>As of March 31, 2020, the fair value of each of our reporting units, except the OpenTable and KAYAK reporting unit, substantially exceeded its respective carrying value. For OpenTable and KAYAK, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $489 million, which is not tax-deductible, resulting in an adjusted carrying value of goodwill for OpenTable and KAYAK of $1.5 billion at March 31, 2020. The goodwill impairment was primarily driven by a significant reduction in the forecasted near-term cash flows of OpenTable and KAYAK as well as the significant decline in comparable companies' market values as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n>  \n>...  \n>  \n>The income approach estimates fair value utilizing long-term growth rates and discount rates applied to the cash flow projection. ***In the cash flow projection, we assume that OpenTable and KAYAK will experience a significant decline in near-term cash flows with a recovery to 2019 levels of financial performance occurring in 2023.*** The shape and timing of the recovery is a key assumption in our fair value calculation (both in the income and market approaches), however, it is highly uncertain whether the actual recovery will match the trajectory or magnitude of our assumptions. If the timing of recovery to 2019 levels of financial performance were to occur in 2022 or 2024, the impact to the estimated fair value, at March 31, 2020, ranges from an increase of over $230 million to a decrease of over $410 million.\n\nThere you have it.  Management is currently assuming key parts of their business don't recover to 2019 levels ***until 2023***.  Holy Crap!   No V-shaped recovery here.\n\n# Balance Sheet\n\nGlenn Fogel and team are extremely competent managers and they are definitely the right people to help BKNG weather the storm.   The team took strong actions to improve their cash position (as has previously been announced) and now has about $14B in cash and cash equivalents (from the call).\n\nFrom the 8-k on April 7, 2020:\n\n> Prior to giving effect to the Senior Notes Offering, the Convertible Notes Offering or any other external financing, and without accessing our revolving credit facility, we believe that: (a) **if our current business volumes persist indefinitely**, our current liquidity will be sufficient to meet the operational and other **needs of our business through at least the end of 2021**, and (b) **if our business volumes continue to decline**, our current liquidity will be sufficient to meet the operational and other **needs of our business until the second half of 2021**. We cannot, however, assure you that this will be the case.  \n\nI don't see BKNG heading to bankruptcy.   They appear to have the cash to weather the storm through 2021-2022.   Management seems to believe that the storm will be much longer for them than other companies.\n\n# tl;dr:  = Will this tank?\n\nWe will find out tomorrow.   Unlike most other earnings releases, BKNG management was fairly descriptive on how poor things look to them going forward.   Sales are down 85% for April 2020 and they don't see much improvement for May.  Q2 is going to be far worse than Q1.  Glenn Fogel, CEO of Booking Holdings, held a very dim view of financial performance **for up to years to come** on the call, only to have that view backed up by the **2023 return to 2019 performance** timetable they gave in the 10-Q.\n\n**My question to you:   is a stock down 80-85% in revenue for Q2 (only -48.7% for Q2 was expected going into the call) with a severely depressed outlook through 2023 priced correctly at only 31% down from recent peak?**\n\nIf this tanks, it will do so justifiably.\n\nIf this doesn't tank, I see this as a new canary in the coal mine for short plays in the near term:  avoid them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy position:  I played a single 5/8 1450p on BKNG for earnings.", "created_utc": 1588906982.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gfl5lg/if_bkng_doesnt_tank_from_this_er_never_short_in/", "is_self": true}
