Chadbulls are the worst, they remind me of this administration. Full autists. \n\nWith that said as I sifted through all the comments for some intel a lot was helpful. Some was not. \n\nFuck you to the guy who told us to take SPCE shorts at 18. And also fuck you because I REupped and that shit will be 12 within a month.
