{"id": "fnvaut", "title": "$DHT got them big ships", "selftext": "TLDR: $DHT $5 Jul 2020 C or $7 Jul 17 C if you are feeling ballsy\n\nAll you need to know is DHT has 25 oil tankers, bigly ones (Very Large Crude Carriers, VLCC) that can store 2M barrels of oil a ship. Corona killed the demand for oil but the Saudi's and Russians are increasing the supply. Where all that oil gonna go? Some in onshore storage until that shit spills over. Then it's going in the tankers boys!! Why? Cause those fucking traders with access to free capital and infinite leverage are going to buy spot crude and sell it forward on the futures market immediately locking in a huge profit cause the oil curve is in Contango.  For example, spread between spot Brent crude and 3 month futures is about $3.6 as I type this brain fart.  All those mouth breathing Goldman and Vitol traders have to do is find some ships to store that crude for 3 months and do the trade over and over cause Contango is the way with the Corona killing demand and the Saudi's and Russians pissing on each other.  Reality is DHT probably won't park ships with oil cause their ships are actually good ones, but all of the other ships storing oil get taken out of the market driving up rates even higher for DHT to deliver crude from Saudi to wherever the hell.\n\nNow for some math. Skip to positions if you are retarded.  Eh, I'm retarded too, do your own math autists.\n\nPS: If you want to follow day rates for these tankers go get the Tankers International App. Don't ask me how to interpret the data cause the shit is complicated.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9my4am2lmio41.png?width=942&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0ac592ad2fedf8c043866aaf759df8a18decd5b", "created_utc": 1585009376.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fnvaut/dht_got_them_big_ships/", "is_self": true}
