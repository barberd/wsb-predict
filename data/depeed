{"id": "depeed", "title": "$COST Job Numbers (10/09, after close)", "selftext": "TL;DR: Wednesday after close is when Costco releases their job numbers. Buy calls exp. 10/18 or 10/25 at start of day tomorrow. \n\nCostco employees are some of the happiest retail employees I ever interact with. The shit they do is menial, but they get paid (relatively) well, so the ratio of applicants to available jobs is pretty high; I know this b/c I tried getting a job there about 4 years ago when I was desperate for work and studying for my masters. Factor in the new store openings and we're looking at a run-up (speculative, obv) leading into Wednesday. \n\nBuy calls tomorrow morning, sell half Wednesday afternoon to hedge your bets, and sell the rest whenever you fucking want. COST could hit 300 if the overall market doesn't shit the bed.", "created_utc": 1570480797, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/depeed/cost_job_numbers_1009_after_close/", "is_self": true}
