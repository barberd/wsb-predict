But it\u2019s not and won\u2019t be. \"\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpl5vz/assume\\_for\\_a\\_moment\\_the\\_stock\\_market\\_was\\_not\\_in\\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpl5vz/assume_for_a_moment_the_stock_market_was_not_in_a/)  March 26 Where I specifically call out XLK, which has gone up from 82 -> 96 in that time.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fr2wzp/potential\\_market\\_game\\_changer\\_antibody\\_testing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fr2wzp/potential_market_game_changer_antibody_testing/)  March 29 Where I warn about antibodies providing low mortality rates. Yes, there is still some confusion about these but they have absolutely encouraged people to be less worried.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxzup7/expected\\_more\\_from\\_gen\\_z/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxzup7/expected_more_from_gen_z/)  Apr 09 where once I can warn against PUTS against SPY.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2lfl2/some\\_read\\_meat\\_for\\_the\\_shorts/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2lfl2/some_read_meat_for_the_shorts/)  Apr 16, where I can advise folks to avoid shorts in SPY.  Yes, ok, my advice in CNK may be a bit early, but I'm still accumulating positions as it rises.  I am considering exiting this position as people are turning out to be more irrational than I expected and it'll just take too long for this bet to pay off.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gjdx10/hot\\_tip\\_for\\_my\\_wsb\\_buddies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gjdx10/hot_tip_for_my_wsb_buddies/)  Where I give a great link which is a leading indicator of pandemic surges.  There has been no surge, which is bullish.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/glskik/an\\_economic\\_faaamine\\_pandemic\\_as\\_a\\_forcing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/glskik/an_economic_faaamine_pandemic_as_a_forcing/)  May 17th, where I discuss the lack of surge.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gr8ujw/shorts\\_on\\_twtr/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gr8ujw/shorts_on_twtr/)  May 26th Where I suggested shorts on twtr.  If you bought them today at opening (May 27th), you could have made out very well.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/go8d3g/drumbeat\\_to\\_decoupling\\_china\\_cracking\\_down\\_on/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/go8d3g/drumbeat_to_decoupling_china_cracking_down_on/)  May 21, my E-mini puts majorly printed on Friday the day after.\n\nI am now making another trade recommendation which I think is a great:  PUTS on tech and calls on mainstreet.\n\nWe are going to see a massive sector rotation out of tech over the summer.  Not just because they are overvalued, but blow back is coming from the trump base / peons.  This is an election year and people are getting a hate on for well employed techies making out like bandits.   Trump / GOP will leverage this:\n\n[https://www.axios.com/tech-summer-antitrust-24cffcc6-8afc-41f8-9b91-5be6d8269202.html](https://www.axios.com/tech-summer-antitrust-24cffcc6-8afc-41f8-9b91-5be6d8269202.html)\n\n[https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/27/politics/donald-trump-twitter-threat-regulate/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/27/politics/donald-trump-twitter-threat-regulate/index.html)\n\nIn particular, this spike will come down:  [https://i.redd.it/xwsciuzx5ov41.jpg](https://i.redd.it/xwsciuzx5ov41.jpg)\n\nYou can do this via puts on XLK or some of tech stocks you don't like.  FB looks good, for sure.  ZM, SHOP, etc.  Anything that is irrationally over valued.   Do calls on stocks you do like and think will do well.  Airlines seem a bit undervalued.\n\nSafest would probably be PUTs on QQQ and calls on Russell 2000 IWM.\n\nSuggestions on how better to arb these are welcomed.  It's why we post, to spark ideas from the community.\n\nIf the economy craters, your trade will be mitigated via the PUTs on QQQ and will soften the loss.   If reopening improves, there will be further sector rotation out of tech and into more mainstreet based stocks.\n\nIf China decoupling occurs, they could hit back on tech like Aapl and others.  Online shopping reliant on importing from China could be hit.\n\nTLDR - I've been right all along.  Now I'm suggesting to follow the sector rotation out of tech that is currently happening with puts on tech / calls on mainstreet, it will mute any potential crashes that may occur via China decoupling or massive pullbacks.\n\nWill add positions to post, but would like to hear first from the crowd for ideas.\n\nEdit:\n\nOne possibility is buy calls on VDC, consumer staples - October 16th, 155.  XLP might have more volume,  Sept 18/59\n\nQQQ options are rather expensive with high IV, you could sell calls and minimize your downside with buying calls at a higher strike price.     \n\n\nMaybe October 16th,  230/250 or 230/240.    \nOr Sept 18 calls, sell 240 and buy 250.    \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1590617906.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/grto4r/arbitrage_tech_and_mainstreet/", "is_self": true}
