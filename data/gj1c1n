In addition to the vote this Friday, on May 21, we have CPUC approval vote for bankruptcy plan and then on May 27 we have final confirmation where judge will approve and PCG will take off. That\u2019s why hedge funds have loaded up on OTM september 20 strike calls. However, the near term momentum that the positive vote will provide will also make sure that we see a rally in PCG\u2019s stock through the end of may. Analysts have given upwards revisions to price targets already despite the chance that the vote may not be a done deal, so as votes start to go in favor of exiting bankruptcy, analysts will continue to raise their price targets. \n\nSo buy May 29 calls to take advantage of all the votes this month, and the reason I say 14.5, is because if you look at February, PCG was at $18 in anticipation for exiting bankruptcy.  Now that we are practically there, why shouldn't we be at least at $18?  Also buy September calls at 19 because there is massive OI for September due to hedge funds seeing the great value in PCG.  Best part is you can sell when IV spikes and make huge profit!  Right now they are super cheap, so take advantage of it now before the bus leaves.\n\nTLDR: buy pcg calls for end of may and September because they will print BIG\n\nEdit: the reason the stock price went down a few days ago was because of a WSJ article that questioned the motivations behind Watts the lawyer.  However, there was a previous issue brought forth before and the judge dismissed it immediately because it was grasping at straws.  The people will vote yes for it, because they will get nothing if they don't and they know it. Thus when the results next week get released voting yes there will be even a bigger jump as there is no run up right now due to that article.", "created_utc": 1589384230.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gj1c1n/pcg_145c_529_and_19c_for_september/", "is_self": true}
