I think the yeast market is really going to explode during the following years. It is also a great hedge against recession when you think about it: people are going to brewing moonshine at home like crazyor they are just going to buy alcohol from the store. Alcohol consumption always grows dyring recessions. Yeast is also used to make bioethanol that has a growing market. Yeast can also be used in biomedicine.\n\nBuying calls on yeast also makes sense, because yeast makes makes dough grow. And what do you want your money to do? Grow.\n\nOne of the big players in the field is AngelYeast Co Ltd SHA:200298. They have a very solid balance sheet, with increasing revenue and profit. Risks are almost negligible: yeast is a consumer staple so it literally can\u2019t go tits up.", "created_utc": 1589298152.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gidmt6/yeast_dd/", "is_self": true}
