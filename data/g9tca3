{"id": "g9tca3", "title": "NCLH June/Oct options", "selftext": "NCLH is Norwegian Cruise lines, a company that in the past was very stable with lowish volatility. Cruise lines in general can be a risky play because no one knows when the world will re open, and it can be assumed many people will still be sceptical of cruises in general being that this virus is only the newest in a long line of \u201csickness\u201d problems that cruise lines have had. THAT BEING SAID,\n\n1.much lower volatility pre virus than its competitor RCL making it more of a value stock for big money to dip into post world Re opening\n\n2. When the world reopens I suspect at least a 10% stock spike for any cruize lines that have handled their financials in this crisis well.\n\n3. It\u2019s possible that many young people will want to get out of the house and take advantage of lower vacation prices in airlines, cruises ect. I know I will be booking a flight to LA as soon as airports open.\n\n4. THEY ARE DOWN 75% SUPER UNDERVALUED even if they are not bringing in any money for months\n\nAll in all do your own due diligence but I think it is a great long term option hold", "created_utc": 1588100794.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9tca3/nclh_juneoct_options/", "is_self": true}
