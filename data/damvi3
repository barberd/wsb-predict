{"id": "damvi3", "title": "Let's sue Bloomberg", "selftext": "It's an open secret that Bloomberg is running an **illegal** PUMP and DUMP scheme to the *benefit of the global elite*. I have been observing this phenomenon closely for quite some time and believe there is finally enough evidence to nail these fuckers to the wall. Let's start with something from recent memory:\n\n&gt;[White House Weighs Limits on U.S. Portfolio Flows Into China](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-27/white-house-weighs-limits-on-u-s-portfolio-flows-into-china-k12ahk4g) \\- Bloomberg, Friday 9/27/2019  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[Treasury Says No Plan to Block Chinese Listings \\`At this Time'](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-28/u-s-treasury-says-no-current-plans-to-block-chinese-listings?srnd=premium) \\- Bloomberg, Saturday 9/28/2019\n\nBloomberg (referred to by many as GLOOMBERG or BLOOMTURD) rocked the markets on Friday, sending the Dow tumbling nearly *300 points* in **3 hours** by breaking the \"news\" that \"sources\" at the White House \"might be considering\" doing something so *completely fucking stupid* that it would send the world into PERMANENT RECESSION. The only reason people didn't laugh Bloomturd out of existence is that they disguise themselves as a reputable, unbiased news outlet rather than a financial-themed version of The Onion. We now know that, in reality, they are a *covert capital kill and shill operation* (COCKSHOP) delivering value to their \"Bloomberg Terminal\" clients by tipping them off a few seconds early about the fake headlines they're about to projectile vomit out into the Twittersphere.\n\nNote the use of \"air quotes\" in the latter headline, putting unnecessary emphasis on \"at this time.\" They do this because they know the headline will accomplish its intended effect of pumping markets on Monday, but want to maintain plausible deniability about their so-called \"sources.\" Might the U.S. Gov't block investment into China \"at another time\"? Was Bloomberg \"acting irresponsibly on unverifiable hearsay in order to generate clicks\"? Nobody knows!\n\nNow let's take a trip down memory lane. September 12th, 10AM. Who could forget September 12th, at 10AM. That's when Bloomberg published this amazing feat of journalism:\n\n&gt;[Trump Advisers Consider Interim China Deal to Delay Tariffs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-12/trump-advisers-considering-interim-china-deal-to-delay-tariffs)\n\nThey managed to pump the market a whopping 0.6% before top trade advisors countered that they were [\"absolutely not\" considering an interim deal](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/12/senior-white-house-official-denies-report-us-considering-interim-china-trade-deal.html), no more than 30 minutes later! Just long enough for the COCKSHOP to switch from calls to puts and separate all of us plebeians from our hard earned **hourly wages**. Later that day Bloomberg covered their asses by practically forcing Trump to say, \"it\u2019s something we would consider\". Boom! \"Sources\" verified!\n\nI think we've all had enough of this blatant corruption and thievery. It's time we stop sitting idly by and **do something about it**. I propose a *class action lawsuit*. If, every time Bloomberg perpetrates one of these pump and dump schemes, the average WSBer loses $100, that's $66.2 MILLION DOLLARS of stolen tendies for us to liberate.
