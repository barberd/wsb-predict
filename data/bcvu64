{"id": "bcvu64", "title": "GameStop, again", "selftext": "\nPeople have posted about the Big Short guy, Burry, having a position in GME. Idk what his angle is, but here is mine. Tell me if I\u2019m stupid.\n\nDeclining sales are a given, and the whole business model is in danger. So out of business right. Is that bad? People mentioned it being a value trap, but is it one if they don\u2019t go bankrupt? I did the Altman Z score (bankruptcy risk assessment) and got a score of 2.95. 3 means they\u2019re probably not going bankrupt. People say that Altman isn\u2019t really relevant anymore, so then just looking at their debt (818 million) can be covered by their cash alone (864 million) and total assets are 2x total liabilities. So I don\u2019t think they\u2019d go bankrupt. \n\nMy calculations got me to a book value per share of 14.30, but websites have it more around 13.50. So I\u2019ll use that. \n\nIf you average 7% in the market, for 5 years, your CAGR is 28.7%\n\nHolding onto GME until they closed up shop would deny you those returns. So to get an equal return, using 13.50 as the price you\u2019d get per share upon dissolution, you\u2019d need to buy in at $9.63. Anything below is a higher return. \n\nI also did a call valuation method using their debt as the strike price and I also got low 14s.\n\nTL,DR: long GameStop because they aren\u2019t going bankrupt, and after paying off debtors, you could receive 13.50 per share?", "created_utc": 1555193007, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bcvu64/gamestop_again/", "is_self": true}
