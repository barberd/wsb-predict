Sure they have 1,000 stores, but they have all their merch on like 30% clearance to keep their revenue up, and they are losing their profit margin YtY. \n\nNext earnings report is gonna make this shit pop. \n\nI'm planning on Jan 17 17.5P's because they are cheap. \n\nIf you wanna play it safer go 19P.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow onto Dicks ($DKS). This shit is actually ass. \n\n[https://i.imgur.com/5TCl0Rh.png](https://i.imgur.com/5TCl0Rh.png)\n\nLook's fucking nice don't it. \n\nZoom out, dumb-ass. \n\nDICKS is a cyclical bag of shit that is addicted to bouncing RSI like a fucking ping pong table. \n\n[https://i.imgur.com/ummttMd.png](https://i.imgur.com/ummttMd.png)\n\nPuts are cheap as fuck right now because everyone thinks this might be the time DICKS actually have any value. \n\nWRONG. IM AN ASS MAN. \n\nNov 1st 36P, 35P, 34P because it's literally bound to fucking happen since DICKS literally cannot hold value for more than a month and I can hold a boner longer than that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for coming to my TedX talk.", "created_utc": 1569273657, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d8d4j9/dkshibb/", "is_self": true}
