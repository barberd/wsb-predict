I'm also in high school, with a brother and middle school, and I've never heard of that game. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-From what I can tell, their other two new games are just updated versions of legacy games (Fifa and battlefield V). I'm not sure how well those are doing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Their mobile games are really nothing to write home about.

Wall street loves those. If it's successful, we could see some serious price movements. On the converse, this could work to our advantage if they cite competition from other services -- for example, Apple. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm buying some puts or at least shorting the stock. Pretty sure I'll be right this time, but who knows.", "created_utc": 1557244992, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/blsgwv/ea_puts/", "is_self": true}
