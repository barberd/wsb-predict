If it's tendies that you're after, it's time to scroll lower.\n\nPalladium is a chemical element with the symbol Pd and atomic number 46. It is a rare and lustrous silvery-white metal discovered in 1803 by the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston. \n\nIn 2020, it will be single greatest hedge to your crappy stonk portfolio. You'll thank me later when HTZ goes to 0. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hhur9ig49c551.png?width=930&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c1dd7e06e484186e0c4fa11da86cd47d82f63d8\n\nTurns out there are multiple tailwinds for palladium being a serious moonshot. In the space of 6 short months from August 2019, palladium was on a tear. Registering a gain exceeding 90%. I'm looking for a rally of a similar magnitude in the coming months. \n\nBetter yet, thanks to COVID-19 palladium is trading at a serious discount. The professionals are incredibly short and these metals are ripe to squeeze higher. \n\nPalladium is primarily used to create catalytic converters for cars. Car demand in China has sprung back quicker than the suits thought. I suspect the same will be happening in the developed world. \n\nOn the supply side of the equation, Russia and South Africa are the two major producers. Both are struggling to produce enough palladium to meet demand. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mjh0ni179c551.png?width=729&format=png&auto=webp&s=caa0ff79ed41dd4d4df65de2cae507c04aeae7d0\n\n[Palladium Price](https://preview.redd.it/87z6kb0a9c551.png?width=715&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ccfa5f6ae839769a0013cb5dfc20c7126c9cf16)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The funds \\(speculators\\) are incredibly short  - let's squeeze 'em. The rally of the last few years was an easy ride pre-COVID. It's time for that era to be reinstated.](https://preview.redd.it/8gx9y5njbc551.png?width=1194&format=png&auto=webp&s=16ec24e7bf0ac92c9f770fd4888b1b8b68daa186)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gtwo0omz8c551.jpg?width=666&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b5fd03cefdcad8b9c0cde54e59fa2f8e20df6bfd", "created_utc": 1592343918.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hadja6/the_metal_2020_tendie_trade_pall_gltr_spp_wpm/", "is_self": true}
