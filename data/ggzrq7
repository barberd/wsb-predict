{"id": "ggzrq7", "title": "How I Escape the PTD rule with a small account and use spy options for gains", "selftext": "The way I have found to get around the PTD is to open a cash account on webull. There are some drawbacks to using a cash account Vs a margin account. If you are use to RH and it\u2019s instant deposit and instant settlement that does not happen with a cash account on webull. The deposit takes about 5 days to clear and become settled funds. But after that it shows up as settled funds and you are free to trade those funds until there are all unsettled. In my experience the funds settle by open the next day.\n\nThe way I use spy to make profit is I look for out of the money options about an hour after market opens. Once I detect a trend in a direction I will by an option in that direction about $2-3 out of the money. These cost about 1.30 if it\u2019s the day before expiration or around .90 if it\u2019s the day of. I don\u2019t hold this to long when the momentum slows down I sell the contract. I\u2019m working with around a $1300 account now i started with $125 about a month ago and have just traded out of the money options that I hold for about an hour at a time at most.once I\u2019m 25% in profit I will let it go a little longer but I\u2019m looking to sell at that point. If the price moves against me more than 10% I sell and cut my loses. I can take 9 or 10 trades a day now before I run out of settled funds. The next morning all my funds are settled and I can trade contracts again picking up 1 or 2 at a time. Given that the spy moves around 5$ a day up or down if you detect the trend early you can make some pretty good gains. Just don\u2019t ride out losing trades and be quick to take profit. \nI hope this helps some of you trading with small accounts. \nLet me know what you think about this strategy and this work around for PTD rule", "created_utc": 1589109780.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ggzrq7/how_i_escape_the_ptd_rule_with_a_small_account/", "is_self": true}
