I lost a lot of money on TQQQ so far.\n\nNow lets look at the last drop in late 2018. The S&amp;P 500 dropped almost 20% from the peak, but if you count the drop from the parabolic selloff in December, it was a drop of over just 11%. But also look how fast it rebounded back up. 2 months later and its like nothing happened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t9uxgp4o2kj41.png?width=685&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=439b25f8fc25a320b72525935a789b3b88db89ca\n\nNow lets look at this 2020 crash in current state. So far we have dropped about 12% from the peak, which is very close to the late 2018 crash, which means we may be close to the end of this crash.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3zoqo0cu2kj41.png?width=681&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82819214e3c918621d6bd72ef05b6d601d41683a\n\nHowever, now I added the rebound from the late 2018 crash to today's crash. I lined up the 50 day moving average (red line) to make it look nice and smooth and realistic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d74pe6wv2kj41.png?width=782&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7958c8e6a8eb07285feb7fa68fb16e020c2fa38\n\nBased on this chart, the S&amp;P 500 will drop to about 2850 and then rebound all the way back up in 2 months. There is also lots of other support at 2850 from August/September of 2019, and also in Spring 2019. Im calling it, the S&amp;P 500 bottom will be tomorrow or Monday @ 2850.\n\nTL:DR Buy SPY calls when it reaches 285", "created_utc": 1582848652, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/faloru/we_are_close_to_the_bottom_buy_spy_calls_soon/", "is_self": true}
