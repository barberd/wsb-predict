{"id": "ccvnku", "title": "Regal Cinemas (CINE) DD", "selftext": "I work at a Regal and they\u2019re on the verge of rolling out Regal Unlimited (a movie pass/AMC A-list clone). It\u2019s ~18 a month to start, cheaper than AMC\u2019s, but you agree to a 12-month pay period when you initially signup. It is legitimately unlimited movies with a few minor caveats (how many tickets you can book at once, etc.) \n\nStarting a few months back, CINE cut the amount of employee passes from 2 a day to 2 a week- moving those passes towards this new program. CINE gave a lot of theatres overhauls; cutting bloated management and switching many of the suppliers. \n\nBottom line: the program looks decent. I say that as someone who has been very critical of our corporate in the past, as well as someone who is critical of movie theatres in general.", "created_utc": 1563058307, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ccvnku/regal_cinemas_cine_dd/", "is_self": true}
