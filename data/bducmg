I've since cashed that in and bought 5 contracts ave cost 4.22. The dip the past week has been in the 3.6 range betting me an unrealized loss of $300. The options crept up a little but back to the 4.00 range. I sold 4 this morning for 4.2 for a realized **loss of only 20.**\n\nI then sat and looked at my remaining option. My bastion of hope just didn't look as bright. As I watched it go from 4.2 to 4.03 I thought to myself \"man. Maybe it's time. It was a good run, let's get out.\" As I moved my mouse over to the trade button... all of a sudden it happened. It went from 4.03 to 4.05. And God damn my first thought was **HOLY SHIT IT'S HAPPENING WERE IN THIS FOR THE LONG HAUL**\n\nAnyways, I guess the point of this post is that I'm a soft back bitch for withdrawing my other contracts,\n\n Qcom to $70 by 11/1/19", "created_utc": 1555423610, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bducmg/had_a_moment_of_weakness_this_morning/", "is_self": true}
