{"id": "ebajf6", "title": "The Economics of Fight Club", "selftext": "In the movie, we see the protaganist realize that money is being used to get more money rather than help people, on a basis that he established mathematical probabilities with an understanding of statistics that would allow the corporate overlords decide whether they wanted to recall a line of cars already produced or not based on known fatal flaws in their construction, usually because of cost cutting measures.\n\nThis happened in real life, right around 2000 keychains that were too heavy would wear away the teeth on the ignition in like 98 model cobolts, or whatever.\n\nLet's say God wants money to be fair, and it's not, so he lets good people accumulate lots of cash and bad people just accumulate lots of debt and pay it as they go with salaries.  Good people have money, Bad people have debt load. \n\nGee that sounds like a karma ledger. I wonder if that God found a way for it to balance for himself and for Mankind?\n\nAssume, just stay with me, the global economy is at general equillibrium at all times but constantly tranforming and that this is because God wants man to be able to use money, but only the man that uses it for good accumulates actual money and not just an incredible debt load sustained by a salary. \n\nWell then wouldn't it be the case if God liked drugs that the US monetary supply is largely buried, in like, South America? Like, I know El Chopo had lots of money and basically ran cocaine generally for the whole united states. If there's a God he was definitely overseeing that project or it just wouldn't have worked.\n\nThat cocaine trade was the reason Regan interfered in south american and middle east politics at once, he wanted the cocaine and heroin to shift places, and it worked. Look at this Opiod crisis.\n\nThis raises a fun question. Is the Presidency of the United States a Secret Service office because they're literally fighting the Galactic empire we call Elohim, or the Atlantis and Annunaki called \"christ's lord, jesus\"? \n\nIf so, then they (ELOHIM, the galactic empire, and the Annunaki, Jesus)  were the ones that gave me the keyst to end fight club, here they are:\n\nThe Pareto curve is and measures the how quickly money is flowing through few hands\n\nThe global economy canot be modeled with the physics of gas, it is assymetric of time like a battery, charging or discharging, same amuont of money or electrons, different cost or charge\n\nso how to end fight club :\n\n* You figure out the structure of a graph of people and businesses, \\[crawl the web with Python, store data in Node.js\\]\n* Figure out how fast it's discharging and where with the GINI index and Panama Papers \\[measure links in Papers\\]\n   *  form the integral of the pareto curve through this graph \\[measure annual spending, net value\\]\n      * as a derivative measure of the Gini index in macroeconomic scale \n      * integrate this data by trying to figure out how fast money moves by industry, position, value of a person\n      * use this data per-person to figure out where companies get their money \n      * Who has what interests and how fast the money is moving with the Pareto curve \n   * then you start placing events on a timeline, figure out which events changed which flows of money, when\n* then you predict where the money is moving now and why\n* then you place a huge YOLO\n\nYou could easily use this network of connections to make predictions about what to watch and why. That could give you a computer that spits mad prophecy about what you should do given a certain set of circumstances given the current prices of options.\n\nJust think about what I just told you. Do you think Goldman, Chase, or AIG would want you to know that? What about Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and Amex (hey guys pls don't close my accounts I owe you 38k freedom units lulz)\n\nNah the government knows this, and the fact that the fed chair has any power means the president has none. They know how this thing works, and it's been going NUTS and they're struggling to hold this giant sideways 11:1 reserve ratio scale leaning tower of pisa upright.\n\nHey, Fed Board, quick question: How do you lend banks money at 1% and let them make their own money at 1100%????\n\nThis isn't, like, a rigged game, is it? PPT much?  \n\n\nSo if it's rigged, and it's against God's name (by not glorifying him, or helping mankind) it will be knocked down soon enough because obviously in some weird way I can see straight through this bullshit.  \n\n\nIf it's not rigged I don't know what is, this looks like We're chasing moby dick", "created_utc": 1576472616, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ebajf6/the_economics_of_fight_club/", "is_self": true}
