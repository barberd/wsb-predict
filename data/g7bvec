Just imagine other retailers. The world is turning digital more and more consumer are shopping online so fdx and ups are going to benefit from this. \nIf you search online you have ups driver exhaust because they are saying that they are delivering as much as the holidays season so just imagine. Also remember Gasoline is cheap worldwide  that means they are benefiting from that also.\nI like ups because America is there dominant revenue. But dislike there pension union obligatory. Fedex i like the fact that there workers are independent no union in the delivery business. But I don\u2019t know the headwind outside of america and Fedex is the dominant player outside of america.", "created_utc": 1587747062.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7bvec/ups_fdx_going_into_earnings/", "is_self": true}
