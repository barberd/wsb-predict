{"id": "etxjx7", "title": "UBER DD", "selftext": "This is a true story, not a shitpost. \n\nSo my roommate was in deep depression for a while and was also in charge of the gas bill. His depression made him lazy and order Uber eats all the time because he couldn\u2019t find the energy to leave the house. He was also unemployed and living off social services so it was strange to see him spend so much on delivery everyday but I didn\u2019t think much about it. \n\nOne day our gas gets cutoff so no hot water or heating. Come to find out the bill hasn\u2019t been paid in 3 months and he\u2019s been using our Money for Uber eats. \n\nHe literally traded living in a warm house for Uber eats. (it was the middle of winter in Canada)\n\nWith the rising amount of \u201cdepressed\u201d individuals popping up, I think it\u2019s a safe bet to long Uber for the time being, until they can fix the big sad. \n\nTL;DR Uber profits off mental illness.
