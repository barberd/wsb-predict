I don't know if it's just me, but I feel like the P/L values that are shown through the app are inaccurate...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor example, I bought some ZM puts at 6:30AM PST this morning when the price of ZM was 242.50. The stock broke down from the its rising wedge pattern and is now at 236 as I'm typing this up. \n\nMy P/L open on ZM was showing \"($15.00)\" when I bought at 6:31am, now it's showing \"($24.00)\" at 8:52am.\n\nDoes anyone else have this problem? If ZM dropped a good 6 dollars, I should be making some tendies... what gives?!", "created_utc": 1592409218.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hatv14/think_or_swim_pl_inaccuracy/", "is_self": true}
