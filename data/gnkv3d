{"id": "gnkv3d", "title": "$ZEN (ZenDesk) DD Inside", "selftext": "Today I was following $ZEN all day because I was looking at the option chain and just saw a wave of buys on the June 19th 90c option. At first I saw maybe 100, and then 300, and then 700, and finally it was almost 1.5k and I said I am not missing this train so i hopped on lightly right before close. At the time, I had zero knowledge of the company, I was simply following someone I saw on Discord. AND THEN THE MARKET CLOSES AND BAM! A HUUUUUGE BUY after hours. Go ahead and look on TOS if you can. 600k was the volume on a single candle. And of course 15 minutes later the news comes out. ZEN will be presenting at an Investors Convention and at an Investors meeting. Cloud services are popping right now, and ZEN is a customer support platform who I am most positive saw tons of traffic during this quarantine. This isn't an earnings run up, this is simply a play that has potential. Pre-Covid, ZEN ATH is 91.51 and I am sure they were nearly as busy as they are now.  \n\n\nTL;DR $ZEN insider buying after hours; news came out 15 minutes later.   \n\n\n6/19 90C", "created_utc": 1590014564.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gnkv3d/zen_zendesk_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
