McDonald\u2019s. I live in NYC and pass by no fewer than half a dozen McDonald\u2019s from my office to my shitty $4200 317 sq ft apartment every single day. \n\nEvery day the place is packed with Asians. No matter the time of day. No less than two dozen Asians in any goddamn McDonald\u2019s in Manhattan. Christ, you could probably go to Mickey D\u2019s in Emporia Kansas at 1:37 in the morning and find five or six Asians. \n\nSo here\u2019s the thing: 1) $MCD hasn\u2019t really been impacted at all \u2014 very minimally \u2014 by the market sell off. 2) Asians love it. 3) I\u2019m not trusting some 62 IQ minimum wage teenage employee to follow any basic sanitary procedures, ever. \n\nMcDonald\u2019s is going to have major closings across the US within a month. You\u2019re welcome. \n\n$MCD 4/9 155p", "created_utc": 1583538283, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/femjr0/asians_and_their_short_mcds/", "is_self": true}
