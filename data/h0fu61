The company is most famous for its iconic Minnie Winnie [RV](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&sxsrf=ALeKk03WXTz-LEmtoHJjouCP2BsiHPNouA%3A1591320526434&source=hp&biw=953&bih=737&ei=zp_ZXvmpF6aEytMPgo6D4Ag&q=winnebago&oq=winneba&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQARgAMgUIABCxAzIFCAAQsQMyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADoECCMQJ1DEBljhDWC5FWgAcAB4AIABT4gB7AOSAQE3mAEAoAEBqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWc&sclient=img#imgrc=kLP91wUrA_dquM)\u2014which I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve all seen on the highway (or been in whilst kidnapped for a family camping trip). The company sells its boats, RVs, and homes all around the United States through its eight manufacturing facilities. \n\nWGO as a stock pick might sound somewhat lame. But much like riding or camping in one, *once you\u2019re in, you\u2019re gonna have fun*. That\u2019s because Winnebago has been on a tear these past few years, and this will only continue w/ the current environment of unrest in cities and Covid. First, know they\u2019ve been on point for a while. Winnebago\u2019s share of the North American RV market was only 3% in 2016. By last December, they managed to more than triple their share to 10%. They\u2019ve also significantly grown their boat sales. As you can see below, this is a company performing well:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ljx9sz7dc4451.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8c5280c67f88bd631423f3f90ac290071b9a283\n\nThat\u2019s great growth\u2014and it puts them in prime position to capitalize on the *massive* surge in RV, boat, and outdoor activity demand which has resulted from Covid-19, and which will further result from people wanting to escape cities and riots. People are absolutely desperate to get outdoors and travel\u2014so much so that Bloomberg is running articles about \u201c[Covid Campers](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-26/-covid-campers-rv-motor-home-and-travel-trailer-sales-shoot-up).\u201d This trend has continued throughout the crisis, and a great way to see this is through a Google trends search:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b9ea7d2jc4451.png?width=1590&format=png&auto=webp&s=41768b29d1ab4ae351fb64f334a7cc30c0277fb2\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ffdetwpjc4451.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d27452dd8830c9b760fa5692fe40f7745a056a8d\n\nWinnebago is poised to beat the competition\u2014they\u2019ve been outperforming them for years. In fact, as of last quarter, their RV sales we\u2019re up 15.3%, despite the industry as a whole then being in a -7+% downturn. Of course, even if Coronavirus helps increase theoretical demand, it still has harsh economic impacts: but in my candid opinion, *poor people were never buying RVs in the first place*. So with dealerships mostly all reopened, and with their factory cranking since May, I think they're going to do extremely well.  \n\nOf course, it\u2019s not just enough to believe that a stock is going to do well, particularly when everyone expects it to do well. It also has to be undervalued. WGO is fundamentally undervalued at its current $66 price. They\u2019ve been getting consistently upgraded (Suntrust just set a $70 price target and it should beat even that) and almost all analysts have a buy rating on them. Their stock price is currently around what it was pre-Covid\u2014despite the stock price of competitors like Camping World and Thor Industries soaring: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9mgu098qc4451.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd4b3bd3501e859b2938dd14b33bf27cd6461363\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9h9iwerpc4451.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=033708b0ab99b9ab74202726e98fc875ec68fdce\n\nBut what really makes this an attractive play to me is the fact that their short float is 12.44%. That\u2019s not extremely high\u2014we won\u2019t see AAL type short-squeeze rocketing\u2014but it is adding gunpowder to their already explosive June 24th earnings report. After all, that\u2019s when we\u2019ll see whether this thesis is truly playing out. \n\nI\u2019m going with **July 17th $70 C** to capture the impact of earnings and the continued momentum from these past few weeks as well as **July 17th $85 C** as lottos. As always, not investment advice, do your own DD, etc. Here\u2019s my final comment: pretend you weren\u2019t wasting all your money on OTM options and risky plays. Then pretend you\u2019re a rich WASP. *Don\u2019t you want to get away from it all?*", "created_utc": 1591810815.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h0fu61/wgo_dont_live_in_a_van_invest_in_one/", "is_self": true}
