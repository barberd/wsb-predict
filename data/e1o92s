I have no experience with loans of any kind.\n\nWould I be able to go to my bank and tell them I want a $40,000 loan with like a plan?\n\nThe plan would be:\n\n1. Put 10k aside for living expenses for a year.\n2. Put 25k into growth stocks that average +50%/y or higher. (MSFT, DIS, NVDA) and get the long gain tax rate.\n3. Use the rest of the 5k for short term gains. \n\nI figure if they gave me the worst loan with ARP of like 30% I'd be able to pay it all off by the next year if I focused on the short term stuff. If not the long term gains will eventually pay it all off within a couple years as long as I keep it above 50%.", "created_utc": 1574722028, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e1o92s/how_realistic_is_taking_out_a_40k_loan_to_quit/", "is_self": true}
