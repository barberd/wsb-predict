{"id": "fvo6yu", "title": "HD closed all stores in Ontario - more coming soon", "selftext": "On Friday, the Ontario government changed their list of essential businesses, removing hardware stores. As such, all Home Depot stores in Ontario are closed. Only online orders delivered curb side are allowed. \n\nOntario represents almost 50% of HD store locations in Canada. Canada is about 10% of total revenue, so that means 5% of Home Depot revenue is impacted. Online is a small portion of retail business in Canada, and items like Paint or other custom items (kitchens, doors and windows, even lumber) can\u2019t be bought online. \n\nNow that Ontario is closed, other jurisdictions will be next. And Home Depot won\u2019t want to risk leaving another province open and have employees get sick and then risk litigation. Detroit is hit much harder than Windsor, right across the bridge, but Detroit stores remain open. HD will be scared of lawsuits and might close the store. \n\nHere\u2019s a better DD: Canadian Tire ($CTC) also closed, and they don\u2019t sell online. So half of their revenue is gone overnight. \n\nPositions:\nSPY 4/17 $255p\nSPY 4/17 $200p\nSPY 5/15 $234p\nSPY 5/15 $200p\nSPY 5/15 $175p\nSPY 9/18 $200p\nSEAS 4/17 $5\nZ 4/17 $25p\nUSO 1/15/20 $4c\n\nedit: people have pointed out that CTC does sell online. That\u2019s true, but it is only their in-store assortment. I went to CanadianTire.ca to verify and their website is down. That\u2019s not a good sign when that\u2019s the only method you have to take orders.", "created_utc": 1586130900.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fvo6yu/hd_closed_all_stores_in_ontario_more_coming_soon/", "is_self": true}
