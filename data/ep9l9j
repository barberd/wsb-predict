I'm literally facing all kinds of collection calls and my numbers are 0 across the board. I went so hard at my entrepreneurial pursuits I went from 383k in the black to 90k in the deep red in 2 years even though I have a degree in Computer Science. I'm an autistic chad.\n\nFirst, find a Fortune 500 target you wouldn't mind researching at weird hours of the night. My favorite conceptual target is named Mark because he's at the center of Facebook, now at the center of politics, and he's the youngest billionaire every (or at least was).\n\nFigure out who Mark Zuckerberg's entire social network is in real life. His family, close friends, and close politicians are all that matter.\n\nThen, find out what the most vulnerable positions in his network are. Companies with basically no cash capital, huge cash flows, and little stability in a volatile market (think about the guys who sold Zuckerberg his mega-yacht and the ones paying him to interact with think tanks)\n\nThen, start watching the vulnerable markets and stocks, with a focus on his network's part of those markets. Figure out who has the biggest position move to make if something bad happens in that market, and start analyzing the rationality of the actors inside that small part of the market as best you can.\n\nThen, as fast as you can, find a programmer or write your own code to watch the dynamics of said sections of vulnerable people's markets, and make it text you or email you as soon as it thinks the indicators are telling you that vulnerable person is about to sell because they have to, or they'll damn near go bankrupt. Make sure you know they have a big position and that their sale will have a real impact in the price of that stock, bond or commodity.\n\nThen buy the largest medium timescale Put on that person's stock that you can stomach. Information wants to be free and if that person has to sell, that means technically they're afraid they might be worthless. If they're afraid they're worthless and that information gets out, well GOOD LUCK! to them. And you, if you plan on doing something with my plan.", "created_utc": 1579127147, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ep9l9j/metadue_kinda_diligence_option_a_public_figure/", "is_self": true}
