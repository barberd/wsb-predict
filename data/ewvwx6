Why in the FUCK did you bears have to watch those Tony Robbins videos and manifest this?\n\nI literally started \"investing\" like two weeks ago. I \"bought the dip\" only for stocks to dip further. What the fuck bears. I had saved up 850 of my finest Canadian Dollars only for me to lose $20 within days. I thought stonks only go up when you walk into the business factory. \n\nI thought I was better than everyone because I was safe. I thought I'd buy the stocks rather than playing options. This sucks. At least with options it's a quick drop, and easy to get over, like my cheating ex. This was slow and gradual, like watching crush get married to her dream man. \n\nI humbly request all Bulls to start visualizing the market rise again, especially, MSFT and AAPL", "created_utc": 1580508634, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ewvwx6/what_the_fuck_bears/", "is_self": true}
