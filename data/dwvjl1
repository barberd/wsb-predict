Also all of his partners quit because he was too autistic.\n\nThe part that's relevant RIGHT NOW and through Monday morning is this:\n\n&gt;Another mathematician Simons had recruited from Stony Brook, Henry Laufer, made important discoveries demonstrating the market\u2019s recurring and overlooked trading sequences. Monday\u2019s price action often followed Friday\u2019s, while Tuesday saw reversions to earlier trends.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Medallion began buying late in the day on a Friday if a clear uptrend existed, and sold early Monday, taking advantage of what they called the \u201cweekend effect\u201d. Odd, fleeting patterns in currency and other markets were identified, some barely perceptible to rivals.\n\n\"late in the day on a Friday if a clear uptrend existed\" IS RIGHT FREAKING NOW! $SPY calls baby! Thank me on Monday morning.", "created_utc": 1573845869, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dwvjl1/easy_money_for_monday_morning/", "is_self": true}
