Said firms are state controlled and it's against the rules. This process is a guilty until proven innocent, and it really seems like the tide is turning against Chinese telcos.\n\nSeems like an open and shut short stock until 0 double your money opportunity... except for the fact that THIS NEWS INEXPLICABLY DIDN'T ALREADY TANK THESE THINGS. I don't know why that is and that's the only reason I'm not balls deep in a short position.\n\nWell it's almost been 30 days.\n\nAnd yes I know these are low vol options smoll pp bois need to lose big on high vol FDs but perhaps an opportunity here nevertheless.\n\nEdit: switched innocent and guilty", "created_utc": 1589863560.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gmhwi7/chu_and_cha/", "is_self": true}
