{"id": "fjcba8", "title": "[DD] The next leg UP we're looking for: TANKERS [STNG TNK LPG DHT and others]", "selftext": "Hello fellow autists - **TL:DR up front: buy calls (or the underlying) on STNG, TNK, LPG, DHT, and any other Tankers out there with a decent balance sheet.**\n\n**IF YOU ARE BUYING CALLS**, USE EARNINGS AS A CATALYST and buy May (Q1 earnings) Or July/August (2Q earnings). For example you can go for **$STNG 25c 7/17.** \n\nI have gotten a lot of good DD from your autists so I wanted to give back to the \"community\". Things feel especially bleak after the looming Treasury & MBS liquidity issues the Fed confirmed this evening during their 6:30pmEST call. I haven't seen much on what can be a good buy at the moment given this shitstorm that's coming. \n\nOn the Friday thread, I responded to someone who asked \"what underlying are you actually adding to right now\" because everything is going to hell in a handbasket. Well, if you've been asking the same question to yourself, do I have a treat for you. You can also play options on this bitch, with the earnings being your catalyst.\n\nI have been steadily adding tankers (the underlying) this week. Why? The oil war between the Saudis and Russia means the market is being absolutely FLOODED with oil. During that circle-jerk presser on Friday afternoon, our President even announced he was buying oil hand over fist at these depressed prices.\n\nEven putting his comments of buying oil aside, tankers are going to moonshot given crude oil contango is getting ridiculous (higher demand for contango storage trades - this absorbs tanker supply). The oil war is actually a phenomenal thing for tankers so day rates are already surging (example: [https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/oil/031120-vlcc-rates-surge-as-saudi-bahri-charters-14-tankers-ahead-of-aramco-output-hike](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/oil/031120-vlcc-rates-surge-as-saudi-bahri-charters-14-tankers-ahead-of-aramco-output-hike)) given they are shipping them. Also, they are not only shipping oil, but also STORING it.\n\nAnother thing - their balance sheets are waaaay better than they were years ago. Take a look at a few of their charts for a good laugh. The good news is they've repaired them and they are trading at crazy NAV discounts.\n\nHere's an interesting note too - Just this week, the CEO of STNG bought (was not awarded, he BOUGHT) 2M in call options with a $15 strike for Jan 2021 expiration. That is no coincidence at all and IMO a bullish signal over the medium term (3-12 months).

If you cannot stomach the volatility don't play the game. But, given the news with oil this will be a great 3-6 month (possibly over a year) play with earnings being catalysts for all of them.\n\nFYI - would love to hear anyone's corollary to this thesis. The one I can think of is de-escalation of oil war between the egomaniacs that are Saudi Arabia and Russia, but I don't see that happening in the next 3-6 months. But I am a complete idiot and don't know the ins-and-outs of the oil markets so again, would to hear reasons NOT to buy as well.\n\n**TLDR: buy STNG, TNK, LPG, DHT, and any others out there. Make sure to do your own DD as well. Or don't.**", "created_utc": 1584320768.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjcba8/dd_the_next_leg_up_were_looking_for_tankers_stng/", "is_self": true}
