{"id": "b90z2f", "title": "CMG very overvalued. Up some 40% in 2019 off guidance?", "selftext": "Earnings yield less than 1%. So the US Federal reserve is paying you 150% MORE on treasury bills before inflation and Chipotle doesn't even give their investors any of their earnings. Even if they were to double their profits (never heard of a restaurant being able to do this one quarter) perhaps a 10 billion market valuation would be valid, but 19.6 billion? \n\nLet alone the fact they were guiding to low single-digits comparable sales growth in Q1 2018 and in Q4 2018 they hit 6.1% comp thanks to their 3.3% price increase. All of a sudden they guide for 4-6% comparable sales for 2019? Thanks, Jay Powell for capitulating to Trump and giving casino stocks like Chipotle 40% stock price increase. \n\nHalf of their earnings call is on \"digital sales\" - they don't talk about how much of their margin is taken by DoorDash and UberEats for delivery lol. Majority of their stores are in the US and they will have to pay people much more than minimum wage to get them to work for Chipotle. That was true last year and even more of a factor this year. They never talk about all the local burrito shops serving burritos for 20% cheaper prices INCLUDING Guacamole? Many of them have more options like Fish tacos I might add.  \n\nI wonder how those comps will do with another \"modest\" price increase in 2019 and wage inflation continuing to be 4-5%? They also mention that they lost their tax deduction on giving free lunches to employees is now gone, and from what I recall the only benefit of working Chipotle is the free food. If they get stingy on that they'll have workers fleeing by the masses lol.\n\nWe'll have to see if they keep inflating their stock with guidance next earnings call at the end of the month. Don't understand why anyone would buy a stock for 108x earnings and NO DIVIDEND in sight when their GAAP earnings were flat in 2018 even with their menu price increases. For Amazon or another tech stock this valuation could be justified, but for a burrito shop? \n\n There's literally no upside to the stock at 705 in this labour market. They spent over 50% of their profits on closing stores in 2018 yet they act like everything is all good and business is booming in their earning calls. Fake news?\n\nI guess all it takes is a guidance boost to make 40% on your money, and that's how the insiders get rich by taking advantage of immigrants and the less well connected! Just ranting here, but I thank whoever's out there reading this.\n\n", "created_utc": 1554312655, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b90z2f/cmg_very_overvalued_up_some_40_in_2019_off/", "is_self": true}
