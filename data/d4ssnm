Most probably at the end of November. It's always hard to predict elections but I'm going to go against the conventional polling and suggest that there'll be a hung parliament. This would mean that there would inevitably be a coalition or at least a supply and confidence agreement between the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party (SNP). I don't have much experience in Forex although I'd like to posit what might occur if following events happen. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. An Election will be called around after October 31st which would drive the value of the **pound down** due to uncertainty\n2. The **pound slowly rises** due to expectations Boris Johnson and the Conservatives will win. This is borne out on flawed polling methodologies that will once again vastly underestimate the youth turnout in the country, similar to 2017. \n3. The result of election night will be a hung parliament that would look something like Conservatives-285 Labour-264  SNP-45 Liberal Democrats-35 Greens-1 Brexit Party-0 allowing for 1 independent and 18 Northern Irish seats. The uncertainty would drive the value of the **pound down**\n4. In the next few days after the election, it seems apparent that the Labour party, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP will form an agreement where they allow Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnel to become Prime Minister and Chancellor respectively on the explicit proviso of a Second Referendum to remain or leave the European Union. The **pound decreases yet again** based on the longstanding concerns of Markets on the Labour Party's socialist agenda.\n5. Labour is hamstrung on their more radical proposals of nationalisation by the Liberal Democrats, likewise, they negotiate a deal that is similar to a Norway type arrangement which would preserve the economic arrangments of the UK's relationship with the European Union whilst ending the political ones. They commit to putting this to a referendum against remain. This makes the economic disruption of Brexit almost minimal. The **pound rises**\n6. Remain win the referendum, this is due to the lower turnout from harder leave voters who view a Norway type arrangement as unsatisfactory. The number of European Union Citizens that have obtained British Citizenship and the demographic shift in 2020 compared to 2016. The result is 58% to remain vs 42% to leave. This causes the value of the **pound to rise** however this will likely be priced in.\n7. The arrangement between the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP collapses due to the raison d'\u00eatre of the Liberal Democrats and the SNP of staying in the European Union is now accomplished. This causes the **pound to decrease** due to stability. \n8. An election leads to a surprise Conservative Victory. This causes the **pound to rise** \n\nThese are speculative events that are entirely academic. However, how would one go around modelling potential rises and falls in a currency based on historical data to make a relatively accurate prediction on price?", "created_utc": 1568592039, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d4ssnm/impact_of_gbpusd_if_jeremy_corbyn_becomes_prime/", "is_self": true}
