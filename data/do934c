I don\u2019t know the price of BYND today, but I don\u2019t think they will have a positive earnings and anyone who can short the stock could make some money. \n\nUnfortunately my tiny account where I just take long positions doesn\u2019t allow me to do that, so I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m not autistic enough to YOLO this. \n\n\nYou should also know I once posted something super retarded in this sub and got ripped a new one, I think I even got banned. Anyway, if this works out for anyone good for you. If it drops, I don\u2019t expect it to go down more than 2-4 dollars \nDo your own DD blah blah", "created_utc": 1572270566, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/do934c/short_bg/", "is_self": true}
