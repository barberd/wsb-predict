{"id": "fdg8rq", "title": "Do Your DD on Charities!", "selftext": "Honestly, I love this subreddit. It\u2019s hilarious and wholesome. Thank each and everyone of you for donating.\n\nI know the Autism Speak donation was partly a joke. However, I\u2019d just like to warn people about who their donating to. Just like buying options and stocks, do some DD on the charity you are donating to.  \n\nTake the charity Autism Speaks (I\u2019ll just call it AS) for example.  \n\nMy gf is currently [Miss Thousand Islands](http://tripleaautism.com/) and is going to be running for Miss New York and her initiative is about Adaptation and Awareness for Autism. She was initially backing the charity AS, but has learned (after speaking with several people in the Autism community) that a lot of people in the autism community actually detest AS.\n\nWhy?  AS is a charity dedicated to curing autism rather than teaching acceptance and kindness towards autistic people. Their commercials are literally aimed at creating fear of arising and misinforming the public into donating for them. Yes, Autism speaks states that they have changed their mission statement and objective in 2016, but old habit die hard. They're still putting out offensive ads that promote hate and fear towards autism. ([More Info](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkOj6wirto))\n\nAn alternative? [Autism Self Advocacy Network](https://www.autismacceptancemonth.com/)\n\nADDITIONALLY, Miss Thousand Islands is having a difficult time getting the support that she needs. If you would like to, please [donate to help her](https://www.missamericaforkids.org/Contestant/francescadalessandro) fund her entrance fees to Miss New York so that I can educate on my initiative and tour on a national level.\n\nTl,dr: Literally the title. Do your DD on the charities your are donating to. Some of them are bad\n\nTl,dr 2: [Donate to Miss Thousand Island](https://www.missamericaforkids.org/Contestant/francescadalessandro) who is promoting Adaptation and Awareness for Autism", "created_utc": 1583342274, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fdg8rq/do_your_dd_on_charities/", "is_self": true}
