Vaccines and cures are 12-18 months out, grammy and grampy should be quarantined to avoid the elder extinction and you all, should be stocking up on your essentials. Now for us, that would be tendies, adderall, cocaine, and for you vegas fucks, wheat grass and $BYND dongs, but for the other people off the spectrum, they're out buying all the doomsday prepping shit. \n\n**Amazon, Target, Costco, Walmart, are all selling/sold out of hand sanitizer. Fucking Amazon third party sellers are gouging the general public on selling bottles of hand sanitizer for $50 - capitalism at its finest, and yes Amazon probably makes 8-10% of those sales too, so why stop it?** \n\nMy local Costco sold out of all bottle water, paper towel, and toilet paper (short earth). \n\nA quick google search for hand sanitizer showed me I could find a little bottle in stock at an Office Fucking Depot. Even the Doomsday preppers won't go to that shitty store. Btw: Who the fuck shops there still? \n\nCase in point: All these retailers are going to cash in on these sales during their quarters/years/periods, whatever the fuck their reporting cycles are come end of March 31st. There will be a large increase in sales from all of these aged products finally clearing the shelves. \n\ntldr: Buy $CST, $WMT, $TGT, $3M - get burned on Vol and Shitty Guidance", "created_utc": 1583419346, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fdw6z8/dd_what_to_buy_over_the_next_month_cost_wmt_tgt/", "is_self": true}
