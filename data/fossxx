Puts on LULU, SNAP, CAR, MAR", "selftext": "TLDR: The job losses are far higher than the market has priced in, and will be the biggest factor in prolonged recession. They will take much longer to return to the market, and that is not priced in. HOWEVER, the number coming out this week will be much lower than reality as a result of administration efforts to dampening the bad news by spreading it over time, and while States scramble to scale up money and process load.\n\nPUTS \n\n3 Apr LULU 135 - 17 Jul SNAP 8 - 15 May CAR 9 - 24 Apr MAR 80 \n\nI am the buffoon that came on WSB who put 50k puts where his mouth is on [on 2/21](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f8bhj7/bear_gang_application_50k_in_puts_for_the_ride/). 1.7 million+ YTD (not dancing, spending wisely)\n\nPuts on 2/21 were on AAL, RCL, LULU, SNAP, HLT, on 2/24 added CAR, LYFT, MS \n\nYou make money when you know what is priced in and what isn't. IMHO, The market has largely priced in all the stimulus, the sudden stops of the markets, and predictions of massive job losses. What is NOT factored in is just how many jobs have been lost, how long it will take for them to come back, and even if they will have a job to come back to. We know hotels, car rentals, retail is hurting, but there are layoffs positions you wouldn't expect across the tax bracket spectrum because of a portion of the job function being interrupted. Who cares if you can work from home, if you work can't be done because you rely on someone that can't do something at the moment.  \n\n[Search queries for unemployment](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&geo=US&q=how%20to%20sign%20up%20for%20unemployment) indicate terrible losses. The folks that get paid under the table, illegal aliens who work, and those in the legal pot industry will have limited to no access or protections from current federal stimulus. However the unemployment numbers pain will be spread out over the next few weeks. States were asked to limit the surge if possible, and will claim to be \"overloaded\", which will spread the surge over the next few weeks. States across the country you wouldn't expect like New Hampshire, are giving people a 4 hour window based on what letter their surname starts within which they can apply, and they changed that mid week to different windows! This is happening all across the country as the loads are adjusted and the states build the capital needed to support the surge. \n\nWe have 15-20% more downside remaining in my opinion. The market is being held up by all means necessary this week, but this won't hold as the market will realize how many jobs are lost and how long that will impact spending behavior. Who the hell will be buying $200 athleisure at LuLuLemon when they are supporting their son, daughter-in-law, and her boyfriend who are moving back in. Once you lose the jobs, it takes a LONG time for them to come back. It will be a long year.", "created_utc": 1585152224.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fossxx/jobs_jobs_jobs_not_priced_in_puts_on_lulu_snap/", "is_self": true}
