We all should know how this works by now\n\n bad news =priced in.   Stonks go up\n\n Slightly less bad than expected =to the moon\n\n\nBAILOUTS: Trump and munchkin have said they won't let BA fail. If the government is gonna bailout banks, commercial airlines, cruise ships, and casinos, Boeing has to be one of the safest companies in the US\n\nBOOMERS: they love BA, price goes down they will FOMO cheap shares.  Hell if I am wrong and it drops <100 I will buy some too. \n\n\nBOMBS: Boeing accounts for 21% of the U.S. Department of Defense procurement budget. \nIf there is one thing I am bullish on it is the US military industrial complex...\n\nSo far in 2020 we have: a dead Iranian general, a quarantine, oil that is worthless, an economy that is predicted to going into deep recession at best, an election year, a random presser about Venezuela narcotics, and Kim probably ded...  there is 100% gonna be some kind of military conflict this year. \n\n\nTLDR: 100% BA calls gonna print...eventually.\n50/50% my weekly FDs might print\n\nAm retarded, am poor, so BA 190c 5/8 FDs", "created_utc": 1588056987.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9ibvq/why_boeing_is_going_to_fly_to_the_moon/", "is_self": true}
