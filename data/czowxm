{"id": "czowxm", "title": "Options Market 9/4/19", "selftext": " S*ource: Schwab Center for Financial Research*\n\n**Today\u2019s Bullish Activity**\n\nMultiple stocks are moving higher following upbeat earnings reports:\n\n* **Coupa Software Inc. (COUP + $19.23 to $153.63):** The enterprise software maker reported Q2 earnings of $0.07 per share ($0.18 beat) on revenue that increased 54.0% year-over-year to $95M (above the $85.38M expected). In terms of guidance, the company said that Q3 EPS is expected to come in a range of $0.05-0.08 (in-line with the $0.06 expected) on revenue that is expected to come in a range of $95.5-96.5M (above the $86.96M consensus estimate) while full-year 2020 EPS is expected to come in a range of $0.11-0.16 on revenue of $369-372M (above the respective $0.09 and $347.21M consensus estimates). Shares of COUP are trading at all-time highs following the results. Calls are outnumbering puts roughly 2:1 with the July 26th 205.00 call being the most actively traded contract (volume is 27,455).\n* **Michaels Companies Inc. (MIK + $1.05 to $6.65):** The arts and crafts retailer reported Q2 earnings of $0.19 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.05 beat) on revenue that fell 1.9% year-over-year to $1.03B (above the $1.02B expected) as comparable same-store sales increased 0.3% year-over-year. The company issued upside Q3 EPS guidance which is expected to come in a range of $0.46-0.51, excluding non-recurring items (versus the $0.46 consensus estimate with comparable same-store sales expected to be flat to up 1.0%) while lowering full-year 2020 EPS to a range of $2.29-2.41 (from $2.31-2.42) on revenue of $5.16-5.19B (from $5.19-5.24B). If you joined yesterday\u2019s Schwab Live Daily webcast, \u201cToday\u2019s Option Market Recap\u201d you might recall that MIK was highlighted for heavy activity (\\~31K contracts) on the October 18th 7.50 call. Calls are outpacing puts better than 5:1 with the October 18th 7.50 call topping the most actives list (volume is 3,908).\n* **Navistar International Corp. (NAV + $1.04 to $22.90):** The truck and diesel engine maker reported fiscal Q3 earnings of $1.56 per share ($0.35 beat) on revenue that rose 16.0% year-over-year to $3.02B (above the $2.92B expected). The company reaffirmed full-year 2019 revenue guidance of $11.25-11.75B with adjusted EBITDA expected to come in a range of $875-925M. Calls are outnumbering puts roughly 3:1 with the September 6th 22.00 call garnering the most attention from traders (volume is 161).\n\nSeveral stocks are also trading to the upside on analyst upgrades/price target increases:\n\n* **Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI + $2.24 to $53.30):** BMO Capital Markets upgraded the videogame maker to \u201cOutperform\u201d from \u201cMarket Perform\u201d and increased their price target to $60.00 from $43.00; call volume is dominating (7:1 over puts) with the October 18th 55.00 call seeing the most action from traders (volume is 5,284).  \n* **Campbell Soup Co. (CPB + $0.62 to $46.05):** Piper Jaffray upgraded the food company to \u201cNeutral\u201d from \u201cUnderweight\u201d and bumped their price target to $45.00 from $40.00, citing better focus and reinvestment in key brands; calls are outnumbering puts roughly 2:1 with the November 15th 43.00 call being the most actively traded contract (volume is 86).\n* **Roku Inc. (ROKU + $7.50 to $164.38):** D.A. Davidson hiked their price target on the streaming device maker to a street-high $185.00 from $135.00, citing the company\u2019s \u201cability to exploit the billions being spent across the industry on proprietary content\u201d and the \u201cinternational advertising-based video on demand market opportunity\u201d; calls are outnumbering puts roughly 5:3 with the September 6th 162.50 call leading the way (volume is 4,878).\n\nNew 52-week highs (120 new highs today): **American Tower Corp. (AMT + $2.24 to $240.08), CME Group Inc. (CME + $1.72 to $219.48), Nextera Energy Inc. (NEE - $1.36 to $224.20), Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT + $0.61 to $115.25)**\n\n**Notable Call Activity**\n\nSome heavy call activity (\\~100:1 over puts) is coming up on the radar on **FireEye Inc. (FEYE + $0.23 to $13.23)** as all of the top 10 most actively traded contracts are calls. Topping the list is the September 13th 13.50 call (volume is 10,753 vs. open interest of 261) which mostly consisted of various mid-sized blocks that were being bought at various times at the ask prices of $0.28 and $0.29 (suggesting bullish intent).\u00a0 \n\n**JD.com Inc. (JD + $0.45 to $29.90):** Calls are outpacing puts roughly 4:1 as option traders primarily target the September 6th 30.00 call. Volume on this contract is 9,305 versus open interest of 1,369, so we know that this primarily represents new positioning. The bulk of the transactions on this contract consisted of various sized blocks that were being bought for between $0.42 and $0.49 each, which suggests bullish intent.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**Today\u2019s Bearish Activity**\u00a0\n\nShares of **Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN - $5.20 to $88.09)** are under pressure after the meat processor lowered guidance which the company is attributing to short-term challenges which include \u201cmargin compression related to a reversal of a gain on mark to market grain derivatives recognized in our third quarter, commodity market volatility, implementation of enhanced food safety initiatives, a beef processing plant fire and slower than expected operational improvements in the chicken segment\u201d. As a result of these challenges the company lowered full-year 2019 adjusted EPS to a range of $5.30-5.70 from $5.75-6.10 (the consensus estimate is currently $5.97). Puts are outnumbering calls roughly 5:2 which is primarily being driven by activity on the September 6th 82.00 put (volume is 3,805).\n\nAlso trading to the downside is **Starbucks Corp. (SBUX - $3.33 to $93.44)** after the coffee giant said that it expects its full-year 2020 EPS growth to be \u201cmeaningfully below\u201d the growth model of at least 10% growth (vs. +10.2% estimate) at the Goldman Sachs Global Retailer Conference earlier this morning. Commenting on the guidance Starbuck\u2019s CFO Patrick Grismer stated, \u201cWe elected to pull forward about $2B worth of share repurchases that we had originally planned for fiscal 2020 into fiscal 2019\u201d. Calls and puts are trading roughly even with the September 6th 93.50 put being the most actively traded contract (volume is 2,479).\n\nNew 52-week lows (26 new lows today): **American Eagle Outfitters Inc. (AEO - $2.20 to $14.07), Esperion Therapeutics Inc. (ESPR - $1.31 to $33.61), The Lovesac Company (LOVE - $0.83 to $15.66), Sarepta Therapeutics Inc. (SRPT + $1.80 to $88.56)**\n\n**Notable Put Activity**\n\nSome unusual put activity (\\~22:1 over calls) is being seen in the **iShares MSCI Hong Kong ETF (EWH + $1.02 to $23.71)** which is primarily being driven by activity on the October 18th 23.00 put. Volume on this contract is 12,436 (vs. open interest of 7,666) which mostly consisted of two 5K blocks that were bought at separate times at the ask price of $0.55. Given the open interest figure of 7,666 we can be fairly certain that at least one of these 5K blocks is a new (bearish) position.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAlso seeing some heavy put activity (\\~10:1 over calls) is **Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (MLNX + $0.69 to $107.69)** which is primarily being driven by a couple of fairly large blocks that simultaneously traded on the January 2020 expiration:\n\n* 100.00 put \u2013 a 1,500 block was bought for $4.40 (open interest is 86)\n* 90.00 put \u2013 a 1,500 block was sold for $2.20 (open interest is 149)\n\nWe know these blocks are new positions based on the open interest figures and it appears that a $10.00-wide bear put spread was established for a net debit of $2.20 (X 1,500 contracts x 100 multiplier, excluding commissions) which suggests that the block trader believes that MLNX will close below the break-even price of $97.80 at expiration.\n\n**Volume Signals** \n\n**General Electric Co. (GE + $0.38 to $8.71):** The fourth most actively traded option contract across the board today is the October 18th 7.00 put as volume is 46,339 (vs. open interest of 143,990) which nearly entirely consisted of two 22.75K blocks that traded around the same time \u2013 one of the 22.75K blocks was bought at the ask price of $0.08 while the other 22.75K block was sold at the bid price of $0.07.\n\n**Tellurian Investments Inc. (TELL + $0.25 to $6.67):** Option volume is running at over 15x the daily average of 146 contracts which is primarily being driven by activity on the September 20th 7.50 call. Volume on this contract is 1,268 (vs. open interest of 4,883) which mostly consisted of various sized blocks that were being bought at the ask price of $0.25.\n\n**iShares MSCI Germany ETF (EWG + $0.36 to $26.51):** Option volume is running at over 9x the daily average of 975 contracts which is primarily being driven by a 5K block that was bought on the October 18th 26.00 put for $0.43 when the bid/ask spread was $0.40 x $0.45 (open interest is 2,085). We know this block is a new position and we can assume the intent is bearish in nature since the trade took place above the midpoint of the bid/ask spread.\n\n**Farfetch Ltd. (FTCH + $0.25 to $9.21):** A couple of large blocks were seen simultaneously trading out on the January 2020 expiration earlier this morning:\n\n* A 5,000 block was bought on the 10.00 call for $1.40 when the bid/ask spread was $1.30 x $1.45 (open interest is 850)\n* A 5,000 block was sold on the 15.00 call for $0.33 (open interest is 67)\n\nWe know these blocks are new positions based on the open interest figures and it appears that a $5.00-wide bull call spread was established for a net debit of $1.07 (X 5,000 contracts x 100 multiplier, excluding commissions) which has the potential to be worth nearly 5x that amount in the event that FTCH closes at or above $15.00 at expiration.\n\n**Gauging Volatility**\n\nThe **CBOE Volatility Index (VIX - 1.92 to 17.74)** has been in the red all day today (intraday range is 17.65-18.83) as equity markets remain higher across the board around the mid-day mark today (DJI + 191, SPX + 25, COMPX + 75). VIX option volume has been tepid today (currently missing from the top 10 most actives list) and the activity has been call-biased (the volume put/call ratio is currently 0.46). The most actively traded contract is the September 18th 22.00 call as volume is 12,661 versus open interest of 110,079.", "created_utc": 1567622388, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/czowxm/options_market_9419/", "is_self": true}
