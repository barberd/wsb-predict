{"id": "bxwm3l", "title": "Are Chinese stocks a buy right now?", "selftext": "I'm a fairly new investor (\\~1 yr) and invested when the Chinese markets were doing well.\n\nI don't actively manage my portfolio so I do see heavy reds for my stocks in - Baba, Baidu, IQ, Huya and I've been buying stocks to average down my price per stock.\n\nI do feel like the market has a major correction right now based on the online research and performance of the companies (except Baidu). I feel like these company prices have pretty much bottomed out and will either stay around the same price or go up from here.\n\nI'm trying to figure out if my strategy to invest is sound - I'm planning to buy more stocks until my avg. price per stock is closer to the current price so when the market reverses, I'll be able to profit off of my severely red stocks right now. Is there a sound strategy to navigate my scenario?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApologies if I haven't used the correct nomenclature to define my situation. Any guidance and resources would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!", "created_utc": 1559924821, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bxwm3l/are_chinese_stocks_a_buy_right_now/", "is_self": true}
