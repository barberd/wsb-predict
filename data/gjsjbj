Can anyone give me a good reason not to jump in?\n\nHere's my thinking:\n\nTraditionally GPRE has made ethanol for the fuel market, which has been getting slammed as drivers pare back their commutes and shopping trips. But recently the company has pivoted toward servicing the hand sanitizer market. In a web conference put on by BMO yesterday, GPRE CEO Todd Becker said:\n\n*\u201cWe are selling \\[hand sanitizer grade alcohol\\] as well, and one thing we announced is our sales and our special relationship with Xerox who is making hospital grade hand sanitizer to go into their communities.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cWe\u2019re talking to major consumers across, consumer companies across the branded \\[hand sanitizer\\] space, that are all in, that all need alcohol, even the type of alcohol we make.\u201d*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GPRE CEO on BMO Web Conference \\(May 13, 2020\\)](https://preview.redd.it/4yd44qqdwry41.png?width=2940&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e838316bb0fd0687433df6f9519fcf3af0e7bc1)\n\nThe stock has been destroyed amid fears about lower sales due to driving demand but Q2 hand sanitizer alcohol sales may not be known until earnings are released. \n\nQ2 earnings are scheduled to be released on August 3rd, so very short term options may not be the way to play this, but the 9/18 $7.00 calls appear popular with OI over 4,000, even more than June 19th $7.00 call OI at 3,175. \n\nThoughts? One concern is whether the hand sanitizer volume offsets the lost volume from fuel demand.\n\nTL;DR: If covid-19 persists, GPRE can continue servicing the hand sanitizer market. If covid-19 is cured, GPRE could ramp up ethanol sales for fuel again. Sep 18 calls will expire after Q2 earnings are released.", "created_utc": 1589482530.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gjsjbj/how_can_this_possibly_go_wrong/", "is_self": true}
