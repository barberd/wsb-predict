A young broke college student is itching with Fomo wishing he would've yolo'd on NKLA like he thought he should've. It could've changed his life in an instant. However he spots a interesting CHK who had once robbed him of $500 3 months ago who is soaring to over 100% gains on the day. He wants revenge, so he places a cheap order of $13p 6/12/2020, 5 contracts at limit of .10 per contract. It doesnt go through and he forgets to cancel it and goes about his boring day. He decides to go fishing. After getting absolutely obliterated by the sun and not catching a single fucking fish he returns to his vehicle to only be amazed that some idiot full-filled his order of 5  put contracts on CHK for only .10 giving him a nice return of 2100%. Ecstatic he calls all his friends who are members of the WSB cult to brag about his tendies and how he is going to diamond hand through to week so he can live lavish with ultimate tendies. He tries to explain to his mother on how he will drop out of college if these tendies print to become a professional WSB but she doesn't understand so now, here I am showing all my fellow WSB members my proudest moment. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tjbbwr7fbr351.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=101c4aec2752ac8278d7a66d7f66aa60db47704a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6m257q7fbr351.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd7b15b72f396fa8b7e9c2e9fcf7dde846a909db", "created_utc": 1591652870.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gz90s6/heres_a_story_on_how_i_accidentally_turned_50_in/", "is_self": true}
