This week doesn\u2019t have much in terms of earnings so it\u2019s back to writing options on AMD, ROKU, and SPY. Planning to sell mostly calls if Monday is green. If Monday and Tuesday are blood red then I\u2019ll choose to sell puts again. Unfortunately I\u2019m still bagholding USO, so I\u2019ll be writing covered calls there too. \n\nLet me know what you are planning to write options on. \n\nProof: https://i.imgur.com/9cYIpSE.png\n\nEDIT: I\u2019m going to start saying writing instead of selling, maybe that will clear things up with the Robinhood crowd.", "created_utc": 1585506660.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/framsh/weekly_theta_gang_thread/", "is_self": true}
