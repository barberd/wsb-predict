App doesn\u2019t show it so will upload later. Profit was another $2,500. \n\nhttps://ibb.co/album/cg0q1F?\n\n\nCurrently holding: \n- NVDA 20 @ 8/16 C160.00 (people say this one is fucked but hey I\u2019ve seen way worse and NVDA after-market is up almost 6%. Definitely going to pass $160.00 tomorrow in my opinion, especially since this, and Walmart have literally held the market. Last day will go out with a bang tomorrow.", "created_utc": 1565912341, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cqy0vp/my_options_trades_since_june_7_2019/", "is_self": true}
