Basically it's a DD for uni, and this company goes down brutally. Shares already dropped over the years - but now there is a new accounting law in Europe in place that companies need to put leasing liabilities on the balance sheet. And guess what? Murberry has HEAVY leasing contracts to make its numbers look better in the past, but with this revealed I doubt that they even can survive another 1-2 years. \n\n\\- 15,9% return on capital in the first 6 month of their accounting year. No growth on revenue, but on costs. \n\nMight not be the biggest short-term tendies for you gr\u20ac\u20acdy retards, but as a long-term bet a good put.", "created_utc": 1574309294, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dzdq8r/murberry_goes_down_put_4/", "is_self": true}
