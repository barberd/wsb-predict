ELI5 at the end if you don't care to read.\n\n# The Fuck is Cel Sci? \n\nCEL-SCI is a small-cap market clinical-stage cancer biopharmaceutical company. It's main product (and the one it will live or die by) is Multikine, an injection meant to treat newly diagnosed advanced head and neck cancer with the goal of extending their life.\n\nIn layman's terms Multikine is a combination of small proteins that signal an immune system response. It's goal is to boost the body's immune system to seek out and destroy cancer cells before the immune system is degraded by chemotherapy and radiation.\n\nThe event-driven Phase 3 study was fully enrolled with 928 patients, and the last patient was treated in September 2016. As of May 4, 2020 the company has announced that the final event (death) needed to perform final analysis has occurred meaning we should expect results to be announced within the next 2 months (End of July, early August at the latest imo). \n\n\n\n# Why Indicators Point To Success \n\n\n\n* Trial has gone on significantly longer than expected (why does this matter? It means people are dying less than predicted which is a good thing! (can be from a number of reasons, the most likely being that Multikine is doing what this Phase 3 trial is set to look for - extending patient's lives)\n\n\n\n* IDMC (independent data monitoring committee) responsible for reviewing study data for safety and efficacy reviewed unblinded data on April 23 and gave go ahead to allow trial to proceed. \n   * Typically, IDMC would stop trials for futility if drugs really didn\u2019t work (seen as recently as March 2020 with the [javelin-head-and-neck-100-trial](https://www.targetedonc.com/view/javelin-head-and-neck-100-trial-discontinued-due-to-efficacy-doubts) where the trial was stopped for efficacy doubts, and Multikine's trial has gone on for 9 years)\n\n\n\n* Their CRO, Ergomed (company in charge of running the trial) has put a large stake in this trial succeeding. \n\n\n\n* The CEO's net worth is tied up in CVM stock and stock options that would expire worthless if the trial fails (and stock goes to sub 1 dollar subsequently) aka hes putting his money where his mouth is\n\n\n\n# Why this shit could bomb \n\nWe know Multikine is doing something since just as recently as a month ago the IDMC allowed the trial to continue with seemingly almost all the data, but we don't know if it will be statistically significant (for example the control arm could be living longer for whatever reason, both experimental and control arms could be living longer for whatever reason, dropout rate could be high and alter results). All of these are unlikely but not completely zero.\n\n\n\n\n\n**ELI5**: Almost 9 year Phase 3 clinical trial ended Monday and we are now anticipating data readout. Reading the tea leaves appear to suggest the trial will be successful, and if so potential payout could be huge ( \\~460M to 4B-6B market-cap depending on how you value it, 7-10x gain). Waiting for buyout could be even bigger (10-12B)\n\nCalls for October-December to be safe (data results likely to hit at the latest July or early August imo)\n\n\n\nProof of position:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/K65y5vz](https://imgur.com/a/K65y5vz) \n\n[https://imgur.com/a/kY7hwqj](https://imgur.com/a/kY7hwqj)", "created_utc": 1588822578.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gez3ra/celsci_nysemktcvm_phase_3_clinical_trial_yolo/", "is_self": true}
