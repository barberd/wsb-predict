{"id": "blv1po", "title": "Long LYFT into ER", "selftext": "Wait, what?  Yep, LONG.  There's a ton of negative things about this company - UBER's shadow, impending strike, and looming IPO weigh heavily. Honestly it's a lousy stock to own.  But we aren't interested in owning it or investing in it; we just want to trade it.  Almost everything negative is already known and already priced in.  The company may be a sham just trying to keep the lights on long enough for the VCs to cash out, but to do that they need the first ER to be solid.  The stock is low and could pop on very little positivity.  Buy now and look to exit after hours or tomorrow morning, then **never trade it again.**", "created_utc": 1557257518, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/blv1po/long_lyft_into_er/", "is_self": true}
