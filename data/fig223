Apparently the trial data out of China is eminent, people keep saying 'this month' but god knows what that means. If there is trial data and its positive, the US and UK could start using it as a prophylaxis. You can get this shit over the counter and its in every country and it's cheap. \n\nI think we will get a rally from this if it's positive but our medical systems are so retarded right now. Boris Johnson wants everyone to get sick so we can find out who is weak and who isn't. Trump has the beer flu + dementia and thinks he'd the CEO of Google. Would they let the public get access to this if it works? What do you the MDs think? Would this rollout at massive scale? Will the stock market go up or down? \n\n[Polish Use](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fi8eox/poland_has_formally_registered_chloroquine_as_a/)\n\n[Korean Use](http://www.koreabiomed.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=7428)\n\n[Italian Use](https://preview.redd.it/gtbv8kqxihm41.jpg?width=759&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b95ba1618c13af598c6faa186a63c2c95204d1ed)\n\n[Japanese Use](https://pj.jiho.jp/article/241682)\n\n[Chinese Use](https://www.genengnews.com/a-lists/how-to-conquer-coronavirus-top-35-treatments-in-development/)", "created_utc": 1584179829.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fig223/calling_all_mds_coronvirus_treatment_approved_in/", "is_self": true}
