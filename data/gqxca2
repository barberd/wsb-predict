On the other hand, BOX has positioned itself as one of the most reliable and responsice cloud storage service for startups and business.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs we saw with datadog, fastly and twilio, more and more businesses are looking for ways to do remote work and that includes sharing their files.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost compagnies are boring and unoriginal, and when they need a video conferencing system, they go for zoom. When they go for a filesharing system, they will go to the only one compagny who has partnered with zoom in file sharing : BOX ([https://blog.zoom.us/wordpress/2019/12/02/share-box-content-zoom-meeting/](https://blog.zoom.us/wordpress/2019/12/02/share-box-content-zoom-meeting/)). This is in particular the case for a lot of hospitals right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost concurrents are dead anyway, a quicksearch will show you that 1/ no one trusts amazon for sensitive data and actually most founders value secrecy so they will GTFO of Amazon unless they have AI / ML needs 2/ cloudera is dead and they started laying off people so it's a no no for any founder who just type their name in google.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBox is an opportunity of the lifetime. Yeah of course not you dumbass but it maybe the opportunity of the week. personally I predict a rise to 25 - 30 and at least 22 so YMMV, personally I hold 19c since last week, it may (still) be the best play to avoid being iv crushed while still leaving some space for massive gains if it goes to moon like around 25 or 30.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. for the pussies out here the only available option is for 19/6 and the IV is ridiculously low (69 right now #lol) so you'll not even lose money if it's wrong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHave fun, while some gamble, I print.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTD.DR Box 19c 6/19", "created_utc": 1590500723.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gqxca2/box_is_going_to_the_moon_this_week/", "is_self": true}
