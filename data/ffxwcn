{"id": "ffxwcn", "title": "Robinhood is fucking me", "selftext": "So I bought about 10k worth of INO calls this morning at market open but none of them got executed. The stock has literally dropped 50% from when I tried to buy the options, and it doesn\u2019t even say pending on the app, only on the website and when I try to cancel the pending order nothing happens. My buying power is decreased by 10k but my investing isn\u2019t, anyone know what\u2019s going to happen? No way in hell RH can execute those orders when the price of the option has dropped so much, would be bs if it does and I never had the chance to sell. One call did say it failed to execute like an hour ago, but only one out of the rest. Hoping they don\u2019t execute because man I swear if they do", "created_utc": 1583773574, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffxwcn/robinhood_is_fucking_me/", "is_self": true}
