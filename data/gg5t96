{"id": "gg5t96", "title": "Why not selling 0DTE credit spreads 3 times a week to fund your FDs & yolos?", "selftext": "Tl,dr sell 0DTE credit spreads on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays to fund your yolos.\n\nEdit: today\u2019s p&l attached\n\nThis is my most consistent and profitable strategy.\n\nThe goal here is to let the options expire worthless and since it\u2019s 0DTE it doesn\u2019t tie up your capital or buying power. You can do this 3 times a week (SPY on Mondays and Wednesday and weeklies on Fridays).\n\nTake today as example, SPY open at 291 and stay above 291 for most of the day, so you can sell 288P, 287P for decent premium. You can take more risk and collect more premium by selling 289P or even 290P.\n\nThe general rule is to sell the opposite direction of the market movement. But SPY opened gap up and lost steam in the afternoon in the last 3 days, so I expected the same for today and sold SPY 293C/298C and BA 135C/150C credit spreads throughout the day. \n\nObviously the earlier you sell the more premium you can collect, but I usually avoid the first 2 hours. \n\nIt\u2019s also important to understand your buying power and how many contracts you can sell, and you don\u2019t want to sell all of them at once in case market moves against you. \n\nTake today as example, BA 135C/150C was pretty safe after I bought them so I let them expire worthless and collect the premiums. SPY 293C/298C was a nail-biter in the last hour and I had to buy them back at the end for $0.10/spread near close. But I still made money since I sold the spreads for $0.20/spread on average. \n\n**Risk management is important since you can lose more than 100%. For example, market dipped midday I sold 4 SPY 292C/297C but I closed them when SPY hit above $291.5 to cut loss/reduce risk (lost $40 here).\n\nSorry, you can\u2019t do this with shit Robinhood. With TDA, you can do 40+ SPY spread easily with 25k capital. If you can get $0.20/spread, you make ~$2.5k a week which can fund your other FDs and yolos.\n\n.[today\u2019s P&L](https://imgur.com/a/TYdxgpM)", "created_utc": 1588986425.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gg5t96/why_not_selling_0dte_credit_spreads_3_times_a/", "is_self": true}
