{"id": "fyizgg", "title": "Live Nation (LYV)", "selftext": "Curious to hear the general consensus on LYV. Bulls and bears invited. Personally, I\u2019ve been adding to my puts every few days (7/17 exp) and it has become my largest position for the following reasons:\n1) they have literally zero revenue right now (priced in, I know)\n2) they are highly leveraged (debt exceeds equity by over 100%)\n3) I believe they will be the absolute last business to recover from Covid-19 due to the nature of their business (concerts, festivals, sports)\n\nEven if we contain the virus in the next couple months, people are going to be extremely cautious about going to a packed arena with thousands of other people (assuming the government even allows this to happen) until there is a vaccine, which is 2021 best case scenario. Despite all this, the stock is still trading near $40 which is ~45% from the highs. That\u2019s a decent drop, but nowhere near something like RCL, which is down 70% from the highs and will likely face a similar recovery timeline.\n\nTLDR; LYV 7/17 25p - disclaimer: I am retarded, this is not financial advise, etc etc \n\nDiscuss", "created_utc": 1586535757.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fyizgg/live_nation_lyv/", "is_self": true}
