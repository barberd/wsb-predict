{"id": "gg0k1r", "title": "Crazy prediction: COVID-19 will seriously hurt the US standing in the Global Economy", "selftext": "So we know that the American response to COVID-19 has been bad. Competing for the Darwin awards bad. The only first world countries that have a higher per-capita infection rate are Spain, Belgium and Iceland, all of which have a significantly fewer new cases per day today compared to their peak infection rate.\n\n[https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) (Click on the countries to the left to see how many new cases are reported compared to the peak)\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html) (Change view to per capita cases)\n\nEvidence of the continued spread in the USA can be seen in the rising of cases outside of NY.\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/05/us/coronavirus-deaths-cases-united-states.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/05/us/coronavirus-deaths-cases-united-states.html)\n\nThis also takes into account the testing rate, since new deaths are dropping in NY, yet the rest of the countries total deaths remains nearly  constant.\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/new-york-coronavirus-cases.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/new-york-coronavirus-cases.html) (scroll down to reported deaths).\n\nvs\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html) (scroll down to reported deaths).\n\nSince there is a lag in data, about 1-2 weeks for new detected cases and 4 weeks for deaths, it means that the non-NY social distancing measures between \\~4/10-4/24 were insufficient to control the spread of the virus. With the loosening of state restrictions, it means the R0 number today will be higher than it was in the two weeks of 4/10-4/24, meaning there will be more new infections per day outside of NYC in 1-2 weeks then there are today.\n\nSo, what does this mean? The US may \"flatten\" the curve, but not control the spread of the virus. In other words, the virus will continue to spread for the foreseeable future in an uncontrolled fashion (with an R0 value very close to 1 meaning daily new cases/death counts remain mostly the same). That  doesn't necessarily mean there will be another spike in infections (although that is possible).\n\nWhy is this? Well, here are the key differences between the USA and (most) other first world countries\n\n1. Lack national contact tracing program\n2. Insufficient testing - especially for rural communities\n3. Insufficient PPE for hospitals and essential workers\n4. Lack of national quarantine plan\n5. A desire by a minority (\\~5-10% of the population - anti-vaxxers and the like) to ignore most safety recommendations (masks, no visiting family, etc) - and no repercussions if safety recommendations are ignored\n6. Reopening Super-spreader locations (Churches, factories, and salons) where spread can continue even with\n7. A refusal by top leadership (Trump Administration) to coordinate an international response - Reduces the ability of countries to coordinate responses such as short term travel bans to hotspots, share PPE, share ventilators, share information, etc.\n8. A refusal of top leadership (Trump Administration) to coordinate an national response - Reduces state-by-state differences and leverages the best scientists to create a baseline plan for the country.\n9. Growing partisanship about the response creating a lack of a response (mostly noticeable in mask wearing). This increases the spread as many anti-vaxxer types see wearing a mask/social distancing as a \"liberal\" issue rather than a \"national\" issue, meaning the virus spreads more.\n\nThere are a lot of big economies (France, Germany, China, Japan, South Korea,  Italy, Australia, Switzerland, Spain, Netherlands, and Turkey) that have reduced the number of new infections to controllable levels.\n\n[https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) (Click on the country in the left pane and click on the daily cases in the bottom right window).\n\nSince the new infection rate is low, that means if they determine a person is infected, they can perform contact tracing on that person, determine who they were in close contact with, and then quarantine everybody who they were in close contact with. This can reduce the number of new infections by a significant amount (I'm guessing reducing the likelihood of another  infection by 75% - bringing the R0 value down significantly below 1) without social distancing efforts. There is no indication that the US will have any of this type of capability for at least 3 months. Probably closer to 6. The issue being a lack of national leadership. States may implement this, but many slow states such as Florida, Georgia, North Dakota, Kansas may not have the resources or political will to get something like this going quickly.\n\nOkay, so what does all this mean for businesses and stocks and investments.\n\nIf you live in one of these countries where new infection rate are low with contact tracing, you are free to go out and spend money without worrying about getting infected. Higher confidence = higher spending. Additionally, these countries are going to be looking to fully re-open their economies  (football games, bars, casinos, etc). With that, they'll be stuck between two options. One, keep their economy open to the US and risk a new outbreak (and thus the economic hit) or close their economy to the US and take the  economic hit until the US gets the virus under control. Essentially, a travel ban of people traveling from the US (and other countries that don't have the virus under control - Russia, Canada, UK, etc in that list) could be possible.\n\nAnother affect of this, which is more important for us, if the US has an uncontrolled spread of the virus, that means factories will be shut down at random (as an outbreak occurs in a factory) in the US for a period of 3-6 months where other country's factories are humming along. With a reduced demand rate, that creates a huge competitive advantage for other countries to provide reliable supply. That means that buyers of products will look for alternative supplies outside of US. This means that big businesses such as GM, BA, F, GE, etc lose long-term market share to competitors in other countries. This can hit other places such as  entertainment where no new US movies are produced, and no US sports are produced.\n\nTo me, this points to not just a slow L shaped recovery. It means that the GDP of the USA will be lower in 2021-22 than it was in 2019. Other countries (Japan, China, South Korea) could see a full recovery by the beginning of 2021.\n\nTell me I'm wrong. I really want to know if I'm completely off base here.", "created_utc": 1588968460.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gg0k1r/crazy_prediction_covid19_will_seriously_hurt_the/", "is_self": true}
