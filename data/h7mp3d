I believed that speculative investors would be seeing to withdraw from TSLA in the present market environment, esp. given that it didn't decline as much as the market did yesterday.\n\nTesla went up 1% with the whole market also up, and my losses were accelerating. At that point, I believed that my deep OTM puts had no chance of paying off and decided to take whatever I could get. Portfolio vaporized.\n\nAbout 30 minutes later, Tesla became the worst performing NASDAQ stock today. It is now the second worst performing stock, and if I had held on, my FDs would have been worth 190k in the green; instead of 46k in the red.\n\nI blew $7867 a minute.\n\nFUCK ME.\n\nI'm so upset.\n\nI don't know what to do.\n\nI still have money in the bank and will be financially okay but this really hurts.\n\nI need some support.
