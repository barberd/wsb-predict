So much so that I actually have to move the tl;dr to the top. Maybe if you got off tic tok and staring at 1 second charts your attention spans would be better. God this explains the short sightedness in every daily thread.\n\ntl;dr SPY 220p 5/15\n\ntl;dr of edit: I love you all and wouldn\u2019t trade it for anything in the world.\n\nDo you not know what the fuck happened in 2008? Haven\u2019t read a book ever since you graduated to develop the skills necessary to know what happened? Look no further. Here is a ELI5ish version of what happened.\n\nYou have lemonade stand. You have $10. You buy ingredients for $5. You make the lemonade and sell the lemonade for 10 cents each. \n\nAfter many months you now have $15. You say no, I want more than $15. You buy cheaper and cheaper ingredients and raise prices so people buy. They don\u2019t like it, but no one has enough money to make lemonade themselves outright so they buy from you bc they have no choice. \n\nPeople watch this from across the street and come to you to buy insurance. What kind of insurance? Well you know, the more people who buy, the more chance there is of them getting sick. So in the event they get sick from food poisoning, the people from across the street get paid. Insurance costs $1 and if someone does get sick then you pay them $10. Who the hell is going to get sick from lemonade? And how are they going to get the blame? It could be anything that made them sick? It\u2019s free money. Why aren\u2019t the people who are buying the fucking lemonade not buying insurance? They don\u2019t even know it exists, if they do then they don\u2019t even have access to buy it.\n\nSo now you are making money from selling lemonade at higher prices with cheaper ingredients and selling insurance for an event that will not only never happen, but if it does there is no proof it was your fault. Ah. The American dream. \n\nYou make hundreds of dollars from this. But you say no, I want more than hundreds of dollars. You buy ingredients from that shady Russian guy who always seems to be mumbling to himself. Your fellow lemonade stand owners see this and hop on the bandwagon. Why not. It\u2019s cheap af and since you\u2019ve spent so little on ingredients you can feed more people. Yay! Some people get sick but it\u2019s all good, it\u2019s flu season so you don\u2019t get any blame. \n\nPeople are still concerned though. So you pay your friend Timmy\u2019s dad who is a doctor to tell everyone the ingredients are fine and perfect. Delicious. The doctor knows that the ingredients are not good for you but if he doesn\u2019t say they are good then you\u2019ll tell your dad that the doctor is fucking your mom. So the doctor complies. \n\nPerfect! Low ingredient cost, high margins, selling insurance which will never pay out because the doctor says everything is fine! But twist! Ingredients turn out defective. People start getting sick, very sick. The people who bought insurance want their money. You sold $20,000 of insurance that would pay $100,000s if people were to get sick. But you only have $10,000. You become sad. But wait! Idea! You pay the doctor some more to get his friends to pay other doctors to do the same thing. Problem solved! \n\nThe people who want their insurance payout get mad and know something is up. You know it won\u2019t last forever. So you get an amazing idea! Let me buy insurance from other lemonade stands and the people across the street. After all, lemonade stands are doing the same thing I am. Shitty ingredients, blackmailing Timmy\u2019s dad, the whole 9. So you do just that, knowing that when it all goes down you\u2019ll be rich from these insurance payouts. And if you don\u2019t you\u2019ll get rich from your lemonade stand and from selling insurance.\n\nSo you raise the price of insurance from $1 to $100. You use the $100 to buy insurance from other lemonade stands. Insurance buyers are getting skeptical since you\u2019re saying everything is fine, but you\u2019re raising the price of insurance like some shit is about to go down, so they comply and pay the increased price, doubling down knowing that shit is about to hit the fan.\n\nFast forward a couple fiscal quarters of you buying shittier and shittier ingredients, selling and buying more and more expensive insurance while buying insurance from other lemonade stands. You\u2019re leveraged to the tits. You\u2019re running out of healthy people to sell lemonade to since there\u2019s only so many healthy people. You didn\u2019t want them to get sick but now you\u2019ll profit off of it so you start selling to people who would more effected by food poisoning. The elderly, people with underlying conditions etc. etc. You don\u2019t want everything to go tits up but are in a great position if it does, so you might as well enjoy the ride and make as much money as you can. Don\u2019t worry about the risk, that\u2019s covered.\n\nFast forward another few fiscal quarters with more everything happening. You realize the house of cards is about to fall and you\u2019re going to be rich from all the insurance you bought from the other lemonade stands. But then reality hits you. You learn to read (you\u2019re in 1st grade now I guess or whenever kids learn to read) and you find out on the insurance receipts that other lemonade stands are ALSO buying insurance from you, in large quantities. If everyone\u2019s as leveraged as you are, then no one is making any money. \n\nIf you get a bunch of money from insurance payouts, then you gotta pay insurance payouts to all the other lemonade stands and other people across the street as well. It\u2019s a 0 sum game. You know this collapse is inevitable, the entire lemonade market is about to be destroyed. \n\nAnd it does. Mass amounts of people start getting sick, there is more than sufficient evidence that it came from your lemonade, which was made from shit ingredients, from shady ass people, backed by insurance that was bought by other lemonade stands and yeah, some people from across the street. And surprise surprise, there\u2019s no money to pay out the insurance, and other lemonade stands also don\u2019t have money to payout the insurance you bought. And as it turns out, people were buying insurance on whether or not the people across the street would get paid out or not. And people were betting on those guys. And these guys are stupid and believe these doctors and lemonade stands so they\u2019re on the other side of this insurance betting. They bet everything will be A OK. No chance this shit goes tits up it\u2019s free money, who cares if these bets are 20 to 1 or 50 to fucking 1 odds. There\u2019s no chance something that has never ever happened happens. This spanned the entire town. Everyone had skin in the game and it was all coming down. Even people 2 towns over were being affected. \n\nIt\u2019s all over. Everything is over. Everyone dies or goes broke. But wait! Your parents give you a couple billion dollars to payout the insurance you sold as well and get you back on your feet and give compensation to the people who were sick from your lemonade. \n\nDo you you give money to people who are sick? Hahaha no you write yourself a fat bonus check. Other lemonade stands\u2019 parents also give their kids a couple billion dollars to get back up and running again and everything is now fine and dandy.\n\nYou turned a collapsing system into you and your buddies getting rich, while the poor became poorer from buying your shit lemonade and now bc they got sick or died they can\u2019t open their own stands to do what you\u2019re doing. Small stands get smaller and bigger ones get bigger. And your dad doesn\u2019t even give a fuck that Timmy\u2019s dad is fucking your mom because he is a literal cuck. He knew what was happening the whole time and was trying to keep things under wraps behind the scenes. Are you in trouble? Nah you\u2019re too important. Go chill on your yacht for a bit. You deserve it after having to sign that bonus check paid for by the very people who got sick from your lemonade. (Signing checks are hard. You\u2019re in the 1st grade remember)\n\nWhile day drinking and doing coke off of hookers\u2019 tits, you get an idea! If your parents will keep giving you money if you get yourself in a mess because of how important you are, then nothing is stopping you from doing it again. And so you will. Like idk maybe have the fed BUY YOUR JUNK FUCKING BONDS.\n\n\n**You/lemonade stands = banks**\n\n**Ingredients = mortgages and mortgage bonds**\n\n**Lemonade = houses**\n\n**Higher prices = higher interest rates**\n\n**Getting sick = defaulting on mortgage payments**\n\n**Insurance = credit default swaps**\n\n**Timmy = Timothy Baker from my 7th grade math class who broke my nose. Fuck you Timmy I hope your parents divorced.**\n\n**Shady Russian guy(s) = greedy mortgage brokers**\n\n**Doctors = ratings agencies**\n\n**Blame shifting = literally blame anything idk poor people and immigrants I guess**\n\n**People across street = Wall Street and those weirdos from the big short**\n\n**People betting on people across street = general retail investors.**\n\n**Other stands = other industries**\n\n**Town(s) = countries**\n\n**Your parents = feds**\n\n**American dream = greed**\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nOk my addy is just about done sooo.
