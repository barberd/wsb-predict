There's no way a stock can stay low with that much retail trading it. Interest on shorts, quotes over 300%. IV means puts are incredibly expensive.\n\nThat means only sane options are to long or to not long.\n\nThere are simply too many market participants for the price to stay low in the short run.\n\nThus fads can rise on attention alone.\n\n\n-----\n**Full disclosure,** I opened long in 5 parts, +20% each day after IPO due to volume analysis. Regular shares only, no options. Exited -20% each day after earnings. Now hold 0 and probably forever 0\n\n\n\n\n---------------\nWhen the attention dies down as everyone moves on to the next new fad, the volume dries up, the stock will look just like tilray. Used and abused.\n\n**Calculations:** \n\nIf we take tilray volume:float ratio and apply top marketcap:marketcap ratios to BYND, the highest possible top given currentvolume and float, in a tilray situation, is BYND at $864.64. Tilray was at 1:1 volume:float for the rally, and ended up with 26Bil peak valuation. That's higher than Deutsche Bank. But who cares? It's a fad, fads aren't rational. \n\nThis means BYND trading at 2:1 volume:float can hit 52Bil valuation in a similar scenario. Whatever it tops at, the hype will eventually move on, and everyone will forget it as it skydives like tilray.\n\nInevitable", "created_utc": 1560671983, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c17lw3/bynd_in_a_tilray_situation_86464_is_possible/", "is_self": true}
