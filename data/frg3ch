The bull-trap is running out of steam and it looks like it\u2019s got another 3 days to 1.5 weeks of steam left in it. I\u2019m picking up a short term call that I hope to sell of buy Wednesday then looking for a call credit spread entry over 265.\n\nTicker: $SPY\n\nIntervals: 1W, 1D, 1H\n\nIndicators: Aroon, MACD, RSI, MA(200 & 50), ATR, NetVolume, VPVR\n\nSignals: \n\n1W: Aroon Bearish, MACD Bearish Increasing Divergence, Net Volume (1.3G) Bullish, KDJ Oversold Converging \n\n1D: Aroon Bearish, MACD Slightly bullish, Net Volume (-220M) Bearish, KDJ Slightly Overbought Divergent\n\n1H: Aroon Bearish, MACD Bearish but Converging, Net Volume (-17k) Neutral, KDJ Neutral\n\nKey Supports: \n\n235\n\n243\n\n257\n\nKey Resistances:\n\n264\n\n270\n\n283\n\nPosition: Short Term $257c 4/17, tight stop. Long-term call bear spread sell 275c buy 280c.\n\nTargets: Take profit on 257c 262 or above and look for entry for call credit spread.\n\nNews: \\[\u201cThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved emergency use for a portable, fast, swab test for the coronavirus Friday which can provide results in less than 15 minutes.\u201d\\] ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fda-greenlights-first-covid-19-pointofcare-test-from-abbott-234449283.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fda-greenlights-first-covid-19-pointofcare-test-from-abbott-234449283.html))\n\n\u201cPresident Donald Trump extended social distancing guidelines to April 30 and said the coronavirus outbreak in the US is likely to peak in two weeks.\u201d(https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-presser-extends-social-distancing-guidelines-until-april-30-2020-3)\n\nAnalysis: Weekly interval indicators are still signaling bearish however daily interval indicators are still signaling bullish indicating some residual steam left in the bull-run. Long/Call position face significant risk as resistances become increasingly significant after 260. 274 and 289 VPVR predict as the most significant resistance price level in SPY\u2019s history (if it ever reaches those levels). Typical retracement for these types of sudden bounces put targets around 275 making 265 a much safer target. Long term bearish trend along with increasing Coronavirus shut downs make a long-term bearish movement almost inevitable. This increases the need for diligent position management on short-term trades.\n\nWeBull Charts: https://imgur.com/gallery/9cMIZSc\n\nVolume Analysis: https://imgur.com/a/MM5voEH\n\nAlternative Plays: None  \n \n\nWall of Shame: [ch1p\\_skylark](https://www.reddit.com/user/ch1p_skylark/) (https://imgur.com/sQNAUjQ)", "created_utc": 1585525825.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frg3ch/spy_technical_analysis_slightly_bullish_257c_417/", "is_self": true}
