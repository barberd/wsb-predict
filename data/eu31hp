You may be wondering \u201cwhat kind of SPED would think this, especially with this Corona outbreak?\u201d Well, first off, the pisswater of a beer, Corona, is just one reason we need to leave this Earth. But besides that, people will want to LEAVE Earth and blast off into space to get away from the virus as well (again, mostly they want to leave because of the Corona pisswater beer). So don\u2019t take my word for it, but try Coronas and you\u2019ll understand (if you are of legal age, of course.. which you aren\u2019t). AIM FOR THE SKY, NO PUSSIES ON OUR ROCKET.
