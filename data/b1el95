TSLA has shot down 7% pre market. \n\nThere is no bad pr on Tesla or the model y. There is only good news around the model y and it\u2019s release. This drop is a huge over reaction based of nothing. \n\nPeople talk about the debt, however the debt was essential to build their gigafactory. They have so much demand for all their products that they\u2019re scrambling to make them. All their products are selling like hot cakes. \n\nThe SUV market is a huge market that Tesla is entering. They did it while keeping the model y sleek and sexy. The release of the model y went very well. Elon is has always been a poor speaker that is normal. \n\nIn 3/31/16 the model 3 was revealed the Tesla stock shot up by 30 dollars. There is no reason for Tesla to not do that today. \n\nThe market is retarted and illogical. If the market was based on logic Tesla would be at the moon right now. This dip is going to be corrected by logic and reason. \n\nTesla will likely be at 300 by the end of the market close.", "created_utc": 1552654408, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b1el95/why_tesla_is_going_to_300_today_after_pm_dip/", "is_self": true}
