The really bright green dot is AAL.\n\n[It's like a really shitty christmas tree](https://preview.redd.it/iofgjamut3n41.png?width=473&format=png&auto=webp&s=53bea2d1e598f4c1e6e2fb185515c9cc29068090)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy did they alone react so positively today to the talks of bailouts?\n\nWell because AAL is absolutely fucked without it and is the most likely to benefit from an bailout. \n\nIf we compare them to the other airlines they are severely over leveraged. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Notice how much cash they have](https://preview.redd.it/edtblygnu3n41.png?width=1774&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f07f029fa87c9094924d6c9281f60e573774afd)\n\nThey have less cash on hand than shitty ass Spirit airlines... Think about that... Spirit is 1/10th the revenue of AAL yet has 4 times the amount of cash on hand. AAL was bleeding already (look at Unlevered  Free Cash Flow.) I expect revenue to be close to 1/2 of what it was and free cash flow to be hit even more when you consider almost all of their profits come from lounges and bags.   \n\n\nAlso... Instead of burning down their debt they focused on stock buybacks. Fuck 'em for being stupid with their money. A bailout will not save this cluster fuck. \n\n**TL/DR:  PUTS AAL DAY LONG.**", "created_utc": 1584395532.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjt6vz/dd_why_aal_alone_went_up_today/", "is_self": true}
