{"id": "h17n9e", "title": "Possible W shape recovery and plan of action (for the bulls)", "selftext": "I as I am sure a lot of other bulls out there got blown out today as we watched our once sure fire SPY calls burn to a crisp as we sold off 1700 points today. Just remember though, stocks really only do go up in the end.\n\nSo now what?\n\nLet's now check our key resistances and see if they hold or if they break cleanly (please correct me if I am wrong). Next resistance when looking at 180 day chart is I believe SPY $300.00 (this is the true test) then $298.5 followed by $285, during the covid drop there was a very strong resistance which bounced us back to $318 followed by $271 and ended up just being a complete bull trap where we continued to fall until $241 (resisted for a week) then ultimately $217.75.\n\nIf this is in fact the beginning of the second leg of a W shaped recovery, then us bulls are going to have to learn from march. This is where I assume that I will get a lot of heat from the majority of WSB but we need to cash gang it up until there is a turning point. At that point find those beat down stocks, looking at you travel industry, banks, theme parks, and retail. At that point we will do some long dated contracts (remember when CCL was $8 and January $15 contracts were only like 1.00?). After that just sit and wait.\n\nThis may be an overreaction but there is nothing but bad news that followed reopening the economy along with massive spiked in covid cases, all brought to a boiling point following JPs press conference and now one of the larges sell offs in stock market history.\n\nIf anyone has any opinions to strengthen this case I and I am sure the rest of us bulls are all ears.\n\nThere is always the other option and convert to being a gay bear.", "created_utc": 1591908352.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h17n9e/possible_w_shape_recovery_and_plan_of_action_for/", "is_self": true}
