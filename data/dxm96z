We know thanks to not QE that spy can only keep going up. With that said if spy rallies to new ATH I'm buying a few puts cheap as a hedge. We've seen strong pullbacks every morning after reaching these new highs only to keep going higher so I'll be out of the puts by the next day in the week I'm sure. Then Im going to buy Facebook call one month out 200 dollar strike price. I'm gonna Average down on it not once, not twice, but thrice. I very much see Facebook returning to its 52 high this week or the next. After that I'm buying Boeing calls 400 dollar strike one month out again. Boeing proved it's one of those companies too big to fail and too important for the US government to allow to fail. I see this stock again pushing to its 52 week high if there's any good news on the 747 you know the stocks gonna rally. Bad news? well I'm gonna average down at least two times on my calls. Any dip in Boeing will be bought the stock has safety and growth in itself. Now if this fails I move to the shitty redneck part of Florida and become a crocodile hunter with the 2000 dollars in savings I have left. If I succeed then I move to the nice part of Florida where the jews and Italians retire in.
