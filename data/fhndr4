{"id": "fhndr4", "title": "I dun fucked up with a market order.", "selftext": "I was up $2k today and feeling cocky on all my brilliant puts, this was good since my furnace just broke.\n\nThen I placed an order for some way OTM puts on some foreign ETF while trading was halted. I ALWAYS put in limit orders for buying, schwabby tells me otherwise today though.  Schwabby insisted I did a market order, I argued otherwise but they insisted and frankly it's my word against theirs at this point.  Long story short, I thought I was buying  5 puts for $300 total with a 2 month expiration, but ended up buying 5 $4k puts that expire today. Market orders right? I was up $2k today and feeling good until trading resumed and was immediately down $2K for the day.\n\nI closed everything and am now probably a PDT now since I have no idea how many trades I opened and closed today in panic.  Oh yah and my Beta fish developed a tumor/large bump today as well.\n\nIt was EEM puts exp dated today/maybe tomorrow, I don't fucking know. I don't know what strike was, it was as low as I could buy though.\n\nEdit: I posted the loss\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/138zx0r5bbm41.png?width=820&format=png&auto=webp&s=83585991ec59b4739c7930f3d8a1f0cfcee062f4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3xyoe3n75bm41.png?width=1028&format=png&auto=webp&s=59b0468c0d545d57ddedecd39dad1885e6e426f8", "created_utc": 1584046319.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhndr4/i_dun_fucked_up_with_a_market_order/", "is_self": true}
