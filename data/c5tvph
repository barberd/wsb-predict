{"id": "c5tvph", "title": "*Tennessee Wine and Spirits Retailers Association v. Thomas* and the Texas liquor market", "selftext": "Today, the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) struck down a two-year residency requirement for operators of liquor stores in the state of Tennessee. In so doing, the Court ruled that ``Under the dormant Commerce Clause cases, a  state law that discriminates against out-of-state goods or nonresident economic actors can be sustained only on a showing that it is narrowly tailored to advanc[e] a legitimate local purpose. Tennessee's 2-year residency requirement plainly favors Tennesseans over nonresidents'' (https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/18-96_5i36.pdf). So Total Wine (privately held) can now operate stores in Tennessee. \n\nThe decision itself has narrow implications for the Tennessee market. But it has much bigger implications in another turf battle: Texas. Currently, Texas bars publicly-traded companies from holding liquor licenses (https://www.texastribune.org/2019/04/16/texas-alcohol-regulations-explained/). In fact, the only ``chains'' that exist in Texas (Specs, Twins, etc.) exist because the licenses are distributed among members of the same family. The result is a byzantine set of laws that limits the marketplace to private companies. \n\nWMT has taken the lead in challenging these laws. The lawsuit started in 2015, with WMT claiming that the Texas law was an undue burden to out-of-state interests. That effort has been under appeal for years. Currently, the appeal sits at the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals (https://www.alcohollawreview.com/wal-mart-sues-texas-over-hard-liquor-restrictions/). The key: that court has been (allegedly) waiting for today's SCOTUS ruling to make its own ruling, since it's subject to the same doctrine. Since SCOTUS ruled that Tennessee was imposing an undue burden on inter-state commerce that wasn't sufficiently justified by a narrowly tailored local interest, the odds just went way up that the 5th Circuit will rule in favor of publicly held companies. \n\nThe two most obvious winners from a ruling in favor of public companies would be WMT and COST. \n\nWhy is this important? Three reasons. First: the Texas liquor market is valued at over $6 billion annually (https://www.dallasnews.com/business/retail/2019/01/31/texas-legislature-may-let-liquor-stores-open-sundays-extend-hours-rest-week). So being able to sell in the state would be a huge boon to business. Second: the ruling is expected to come by the end of the summer. Third: in the case of COST, most states prohibit the formation of ``clubs'' for liquor sales (https://lifehacker.com/the-best-things-you-can-do-at-costco-without-a-membersh-1591680306), so you are usually able to buy alcohol without a membership. \n\nLastly, WMT especially should be somewhat impervious to short-term economic news (bad economy = more Wal-Mart), so this would just be the icing on the cake for August calls.", "created_utc": 1561575004, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c5tvph/tennessee_wine_and_spirits_retailers_association/", "is_self": true}
