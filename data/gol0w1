Literally, since my last post I didn't think the DD on here could get worse, but I just watched a dog shit on the lawn tagged as DD. \n\n\nI know it can feel like actually learning about the companies you're investing in is useless in this market, but---hear me out on this one---maybe reading a 10K instead of reading patterns in dog doo is a better use of your time. \n\nIf you had listened to me in my previous posts, you would have gone long on CACC (+15%),  long on EZPW (+7%), FCFS (3%) and of course Gold (+2%). What do my dog-level genius picks have in common?  All my favorite companies target the poor and desperate and fleece them for all they're worth. So lets try to add another stock to the Duncan's Amoral Index.\n\nAll over this big beautiful nation, renters are missing payments landlords are getting ready for some mass evictions, and soon to be retirees are seeing their retirement dreams downsized. Think that 56 year old secretary is getting hired back on after crisis? No one wants to see her 2021 Twelve Months of Puppies Calendar. [It's off to early retirement for those boomers](http://vjmpublishing.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/boomerfishing-1024x520.png).  So what are they left to do? Well, these folks are falling down the housing ladder and there are quite a few steps  to hit on the way down. \n\nMost people will do anything to avoid being homeless, and so lots and lots of folks are likely to end up looking for housing that is available right now, for cheap. There are two solutions that exist for just those customers: Manufactured (or Mobile) Homes and Extended Stay motels. Both industries have significant profit margins, as they over-charge for comparatively little housing. Both will likely see demand increase as people default on mortgages or miss rent payments. \n\nSo, there are two companies we are going to look at today. The first is Equity Lifestyle Properties (ELS), the nation's largest owner and operator of ~~manufactured home communities~~ trailer parks The next is Extended Stay America (STAY) a hotel chain focused exclusively on providing long term housing, often to transient or displaced workers. Which one is a better investment? Well, to see we are going to look into their 10Ks and find out\n\n\n[ELS 10k](https://equitylifestyle.gcs-web.com/static-files/6057d39c-adc0-4b6e-8b29-bd68d359b7cf)\n\n\n[STAY 10K](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1507563/000162828020002318/stay-20191231.htm)\n\nIn this post, we are going to be looking more closely at Cash Flow Statements. Now, Cash Flow statements are a little more complex than a balance sheet, but still fairly legible if you take your time. Basically, it is a measure of money going in and coming out in a given year. Some key data points to look at are the cash at the beginning and end of the year, and the cash flows from Operating, Investing, and Financing. Operating being the money being brought in or lost from operating the business. Investing activities is a look at investments the company is making/ receving returns from, and financing is taking out and paying back loans. Basically. \n\n\n\nSo, looking at STAY's balance sheet on pg 82, we are seeing the company has maaaaad debts. I mean, Debt to Equity is like 4:1. That is a warning bell that this company may not be able to take on more debt to weather this short term economic storm. However, lets look at the cash flow statement on pg 86. Reading down to \"FINANCING ACTIVITIES\" we can see that STAY spent an insane 507,261 on principle payments. How did it do so, when its net cash for the year was just 400,000? Well it apparently issued even more debt, to the tune of 750,000. And this, bear in mind, was before the 'rona! All this spending was happening amid a falling EPS and falling revenues. How is STAY going to weather the economic crisis long enough to be operational when people start getting evicted en masse? That is going to be a struggle. Frankly, if STAY needs to take on more debt to survive the 'rona, I don't see how they pay it off, even if the whole country tries to get an extended stay motel room. \n\n\nNow, lets see what ELS is up to. Looking at pg F-5 of their 10K, we see a way healthier state of affairs. The company is mostly run as an REIT, so its assets are heavily concentrated in land and the improvements to said land. You might consider non-building 'land improvements' to be a bullshit 'goodwill' type category, but I argue that for mobile home parks adding improvements like utility hookups, internet, roads, and fencing, etc actually does add value as it turns a patch of dirt into a turnkey mobile home park. \n\nELS has a way better debt to equity ratio, especially considering that the vast majority of their debt is not senior notes, but are mortgage payments, backed by real assets in the form of land. Now, we scroll down to the Cash Flow Statement. Now, ELS is cash flow negative, meaning it ended 2019 with a little less cash than it started with. But looking more closely, we see that while they did do some debt-funded share buybacks/dividends, they also bought and improved a lot of new land. And, their yearly net income is rising rapidly. They have lots of room cut back new land acquisition, cut back on capital projects, and scale down dividends before they will ever need to turn to debt to sustain operations. While I don't love that 315,000 line of credit they took out this year, it is pretty clear that their 443,000 net operating cash can cover down on a lot of problems. \n\n\nSo, when we look it over, it is clear that a wise investor will poop in ELS every time.\n\n\n** TL;DR: Poop in ELS**", "created_utc": 1590159987.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gol0w1/how_to_read_a_10k_pt_3_trailer_parks_vs_seedy/", "is_self": true}
