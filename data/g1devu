I get that money printer goes brrrr and that there are bread lines. \n\nAll that matters is price. Follow the price, don't try to make sense of it.\n\nIf the market is in an uptrend, ride the uptrend. It will go down when it wants to, not when your autist DD says so \"because it just HAS to for X, Y, Z reasons.\"   \n\n\nTLDR: Use what the market is giving you and forget whatever opinions you have.
