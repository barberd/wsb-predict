Normally, you would like to be moderately informed to do these kind of plays. However, this is WSB. I know you yolo'ers care not about lengthy explanations \u2014 as I do not about writing them. So here I am to bring you nice and interactive maps, 'cause everyone knows autistic bears and bulls alike like shiny things.\n\nhttps://www.marinetraffic.com/\n\nhttps://www.flightradar24.com/\n\nWhilst they are not real-time satellite imaging the likes of which you could've seen in the China Hustle, both of these tools are maps that can show you real-time (and past imaging \u2014 under their paid versions) of whatever registered tankers and commercial flights alike are doing. Figured some of you would care enough to use them compare the volume of traffic of vessels moving around or some other smart shit. Or just to entertain yourselves, whatever. That's up to you.\n\nIt can also work to confirm your own notions on how the US and China are gonna be kill, given 90% or so of the air-traffic world-wide right now is domestic flights inside the US and China.\n\nGodspeed you beautiful retards, and may your tendies be eternal.\n\nPositions: \n\nBP puts 05/29 21.50$\n\nXOM puts 05/29 41.50$\n\nP.S: Questrade was an inside job.", "created_utc": 1587787641.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7n6p3/if_youre_gonna_bet_on_oil_or_airlines_get_your/", "is_self": true}
