That will recover to 50$ eventually, let me bring a little money into USO and get those sweet gains.

What you saw is the tail end of Crude Oil May WTI contracts trading just before its close (tomorrow). This price is shockingly low, but the majority of the traders have already moved on to June contracts. Focus on the June contract (also shocking how much it moved and much more important right now) instead of the nearly dead May one. Let's begin... \n\nBackground:\nWhy are oil prices so low? Saudi Arabia and Russia and OPEC+ created a massive increase in supply after failed negotiations (This is itself an aftershock to a coordinated oversupply of the market in 2016 to fight US shale). This excess supply timed with a drop in demand as the world shut down due to corona virus. The result has meant that the market is flooded with oil and is looking for any place they can to store it. This storage crunch has even resulted in some bizarre cases of negative pricing (Canada in some places). This has all been especially damaging to US shale due to the high cost of extraction, the high levels of debt these companies have, and the slow reaction of the US to secure cuts to global or domestic output and a failure to provide relief money to this industry. \n\nDevelopment looking forward:\nPrices will stabilize when we have a good idea of when and how much demand there will be in the near-term, mid-term, and long-term. I say this in this way since we still do not know how US industry will reopen. Lots of plans are floating around, but what happens when we have a spike in cases in a few months? Boom, back to a shutdown, and guidance is once again thrown out the window. What is really great about looking month by month at oil contracts, is we can see the expected curve of economic recovery/ industrial demand, as the industry currently sees it [7]. What we can also see is today's movement is the dragging down further out contract prices as the nearterm (May / June) prices collapse. As we gain more information about how and when the economy will open, we can expect the price of oil to change accordingly.     \n\nWhat do I see:\nThere is still a ton of room left for oil to come down, but, stop looking at May and look forward. For ETFs like USO, which don't want the physical commodity showing up at their door, must \"roll forward\" their near-to-expiry contracts (cheap), into further out contracts (expensive). Today, as it stands, the near-term contracts (May/June) are massively cheaper than further out contracts. This means, as USO continues to roll its June contracts (22.59) out, they have to pay ~20%+ premium to secure contracts (July: 27.77). ***They are selling low and buying high due to the state of contango. As long as these market conditions persist, they won't begin to climb and will instead keep sinking.*** The oil futures are still pricing in a rather sharp recovery, but the more that gets nudged out, the worse for USO. If we keep saying \"V Shaped recovery, right around the corner\" then (as long as investors have faith in that plan) the commodity prices keep reflecting a V-up. As you approach expiration, and you kick the re-opening can down the road, near-expiry contracts sink (no one wants to pay to store the oil) and you keep contango going. As a result, USO continues downward. Even when this situation undwinds, USO will simply not return to previous highs due to the way it is structured. \n\nWhat am I afraid of:\nRetail investors have flooded USO with money in hopes of a sharp rebound. We know that retail investors are piling on, since the number of individuals has skyrocketed [1][2]. If real ***professional*** traders were the ones adding money, placing long bets, we would not have seen such an exponential increase in the number of accounts with holdings. This tells me the following: As contango continues, and USO drops / fails to grow over the next months, retail money will FOMO / margin call out. This outflow of money could have a drastic impact on the stability of the ETF, and, in turn, the overall US oil market. ***USO currently controls over 25% of all outstanding WTI contracts***. If the recent inflows to USO reverses, with a continued supply glut and decreased demand, we could see a destabilization of the ETF and broader market. If USO needs to quickly sell a massive number of contacts due to fund outflows and rebalancing, then the fund is at risk of a death spiral -> Sell contracts to the market, drop in price due to low demand and high supply -> further losses -> further outflows -> and on and on. This is not a likely situation, this can only happen if there is a massive + sustained + quick drop, followed by a massive and quick pull of funds from the ETF. However, the speed with which the ETF has grown has me worried for the way retail investors will react when their quick 200% sure-thing oil play becomes a -50% loss over the course of a month (or a week).\n\nTLDR: USO, where to Go? \nScared Money: Stay the fuck away from this.\nSmart Money: Call Credit Spreads. Take advantage of all the money which has poured into the fund, and which will continue to do so in the short term. They are waiting for a quick rebound once the economy reopens. The ETF is not structured for this, and will continue to suffer forward rolling loses. Collect your drip drip drip of oil premium and chill. Keep an eye on government intervention, be ready to exit early on bailouts.\nDumb Money: Buy short term calls for swing trading spikes - today might be a good gamble, oversold on the roll forward?\n\nPositions: OXY $7.5/5P 9/18 10 Contracts, EPD covered calls, trying to catch premium before getting assigned and holding for the next 5-10yrs, DRIP shares on the 10%+ dividend.", "created_utc": 1587397006.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g4v02j/uso_gtfo/", "is_self": true}
