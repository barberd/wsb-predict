{"id": "ck1nvq", "title": "still bullish on US stocks, bearish on China", "selftext": "This is a long short trade.  I think the Fed will definitely go with a 25bp cut today even though none is really needed with asset prices in the USA near all-time highs.  HOWEVER, the Fed will be reserved in its guidance concerning future cuts.  This will be dollar bullish.  Rates will go up on the long end.  TLT is looking to fall from here.  QQQ is the place to be long.  EWH/FXI is still a good short.  Trade talks are bullcrap because Trump knows as clear as day that China wants to wait for its bribed candidate Biden to take office.  Trump isn't getting anything out of China and I think there is a high likelihood that China is going to intentionally pull liquidity out of its market in 2020 just to tank the entire global financial system to get Trump out of office.", "created_utc": 1564537797, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ck1nvq/still_bullish_on_us_stocks_bearish_on_china/", "is_self": true}
