I want to invest $1000 on TD ameritrade just for fun to get started and learn about the market. I was leaning towards 5G, thinking maybe Nokia or Ericsson for something I can actually afford with only 1000 to put in. I am still a believer in Weed stocks like Aurora and Aphria for more long term. I could be wrong in all of this, but any recommendations?
