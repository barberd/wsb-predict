{"id": "ds4f3d", "title": "TRUE might face bankruptcy", "selftext": "TrueCar recently \u201cwon\u201d a class action lawsuit against hundreds of dealerships who sued for securities violations. The main concern was that TRUE advertised a \u201chaggle-free\u201d experience at affiliated dealerships, claiming that customers could buy cars based on a quoted price. However this was not a part of their actual agreements with the dealerships and customers who went in expecting a \u201cbuy it now\u201d price still had to go through the negotiation process. The dealerships sued, claiming this hurt their reputation and demanded damages.\n\nTwo months ago, the judge ruled that the real victims of this false advertising were the other car buying platforms (CarsDirect, etc), therefore the dealerships were not the appropriate plaintiffs to bring the lawsuit. However, because evidence surfaced that showed how TRUE had ignored their own legal counsel\u2019s recommendation against the deceptive marketing material, the judge found the company has \u201cunequivocally and willfully falsely advertised and violated the Lanham Act\u201d, meaning a 2-3x multiplier will be applied to any damages awarded as punishment. Further more the judge found TRUE\u2019s blatant act of violation so guilty, he stated in his opinion that \u201ca differently situated set of plaintiffs (ie TRUE competitors) would have been awarded damages\u201d. The opinion went on to note that any/all competitors could bring exactly the same lawsuit and TRUE would be liable. The company didn\u2019t even argue against this guilty indictment.\n\nThe lawsuit claimed $250M in damages. Assuming TRUE\u2019s competitors bring forth the exact same lawsuit as the judge recommended, and gets awarded only 50% ($125M). Apply a conservative 2x punitive multiplier, and you have a $384M market cap company facing $300M of fraud charges. Take into consideration that the dealerships who sued will likely not continue business with TRUE, then there is little case for the company\u2019s continued survival.\n\nBonus: CEO abruptly resigned in June with no transition period or notice. During his tenure, company stock lost 75% of value. According to his terms of employment \u201cif... employment terminates voluntarily... then [he] will receive accrued amounts (of salary) but will not be entitled to receive severance or other benefits.\u201d Yet dispute his poor performance, he was awarded $32M in severance with the agreement to not sue the company. Two weeks later the CTO was fired.\n\nConsidering they could bring forward a lawsuit and 1. get awarded millions in damages and 2. get ride of a major competitor, TRUE\u2019s competitors are likely already preparing to file suit.", "created_utc": 1572983105, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ds4f3d/true_might_face_bankruptcy/", "is_self": true}
