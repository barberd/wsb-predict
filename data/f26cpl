Hmm, I didn't see any brothers on TV bringing this unusual activity to light, but I digress...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: these values are not perfect. For simplicity, I'm just ignoring implied volatility. Sprint is at $8 after hours, and I'll be basing a lot of these values off that price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's a rundown of some of the big bets that made folks rich yesterday:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The envy trade.\n\nThese two trades were large, single-sided, and had very round quantities, so I grouped them together (in my mind, it's the same trader)\n\n|Cost|Return|Qty|Price|Option|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|140K|**875K** (+735K, 525%)|2500|0.55|14 FEB 20 4.5 C|\n|15K|**100K** (+85K, 566%)|1000|0.15|21 FEB 20 7 C|\n\nThese two trades turned 155K into 975K.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The hedger.\n\nThe largest quantity order that executed was a lopsided 6/7 call spread. The trader sold 13.5 thousand of the 7 strike calls for \\~215K, and bought 9 thousand of the 6 strike calls (1.5 short for every 1 long).\n\nThis is a nice trade, but not for wsb. By selling the additional 4500 further out of the money calls, the trader reduced their cost to enter the trade from 153K to 81K. A 50% discount on your cost basis is great, but in this case it also limited their gains by almost 50%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Cost|Return|Qty|Price|Option|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|80K|**370K** (+290K, 363%) 1.8M - 1.35M - 80K)|9,000 / 13,500|0.33 / 0.16|21 FEB 20 6 C / 21 FEB 20 7 C|\n\n(-1.8M from the short 7 strikes, and +1.35M from the long 6 strikes)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf the trader had instead bought 9,000 of the same spreads for 0.17, paying 153K instead of 80K, they could have made \\~850K rather than the measly 290K they made.\n\n|Cost|Return|Qty|Price|Option|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|153K|**900K** (+847K, 488%)|9,000|0.17|21 FEB 20 6 C / 21 FEB 20 7 C|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The prime spreader.\n\nThis may be all coincidence, but I bet some trader loves math/numbers because some large quantities of contracts traded yesterday happened to be prime numbers:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Cost|Return|Qty|Price|Option|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|59K|**123K** (+64K, 108%)|1,823|0.71 / 0.39|15 MAY 20 6 C / 15 MAY 20 7 C|\n|57K|**279K** (+222K, 389%)|929|0.86 / 0.25|20 MAR 20 5 C / 15 MAY 20 8 C|\n|28K|**135K** (+107K, 382%)|449|0.86 / 0.25|20 MAR 20 5 C / 15 MAY 20 8 C|\n|17K|**69K** (+52K, 306%)|229|0.94 / 0.2|20 MAR 20 5 C / 15 MAY 20 8 C|\n|14K|**67K** (+53K, 379%)|223|0.94 / 0.2|20 MAR 20 5 C / 15 MAY 20 8 C|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Other\n\nVery popular was the \"20 MAR 20 5 C / 15 MAY 20 8 C\" debit spread. This spread was so popular, it was traded in a quantity of 250, 13 separate times. Those 3250 contracts cost about 220K, and in total will be worth about 975K tomorrow.", "created_utc": 1581415550, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f26cpl/insider_trading_on_sprint_options_millions_in/", "is_self": true}
