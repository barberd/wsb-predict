Thank you Roku.  I bought calls post earnings because the drop didn't seem right.  I sold some calls expiring 11/15 earlier this week even though I thought it was still going up.  I took the proceeds from those to buy 11/22 calls.  Sold some today to just take profit and planning to keep that money out for the time being as I still have open positions of about $25K.  Hopefully it doesn't take a dump on me.\n\nThe above gains porn is not 100% since I was dabbling with small positions in other stuff, but nothing really significant, so 99% of that is ROKU.\n\nThese were my positions over the past week\n\n**Sold (but rolled over proceeds into 11/22 calls)**\n\n* 11/7: Bought 6 ROKU $130 Call expiring 11/15 @ $3.30\n* 11/11: Sold 6 ROKU $130 Call expiring 11/15 @ $3.40\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* 11/7: Bought 2 ROKU $126 Call expiring 11/15 @ $1.98 \n* 11/12: Sold 2 ROKU $126 Call expiring 11/15 @ $10.05\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Partially Sold (keeping the proceeds on the sidelines for now)**\n\n* 11/11: Bought 12 ROKU $125 Call expiring 11/15 @ $2.36\n* 11/13: Sold 4 ROKU $125 Call expiring 11/15 @ $15.40\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Still Holding**\n\nSo I still have 8 ROKU $125 Call expiring 11/15 acquired @ $2.36\n\nAnd these\n\n11/11: Bought 1 ROKU $133 Call expiring 11/22 @ $1.65\n\n11/11: Bought 6 ROKU $135 Call expiring 11/22 @ $3.25\n\n11/12: Bought 6 ROKU $140 Call expiring 11/22 @ $3.30\n\nSome more detailed images: [https://imgur.com/a/EVjaz6K](https://imgur.com/a/EVjaz6K)", "created_utc": 1573679582, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dvyeqf/roku_blastoff_since_monday_morning/", "is_self": true}
