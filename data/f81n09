Exit your TQQQ on Monday and buy these ETFs instead!", "selftext": "I was drinking my coffee when 'the flash crash' of 2/20/20 occurred.  The stupidity of the CNBC anchors spouting the same shit for the first 10 minutes was phenomenal.  'Fears of corona must have finally taken hold,' 'Trump just tweeted' (it was some banal shit that wasn't one of his usual pumps), all stupid shit their Masters in Finance degree and kneepads in risk-adverse mindset has trained them to say and has gotten them to a cushy 6 figure gig. Eventually the only hard dick dude on the air \\[source file:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp-Jw-5Kx8k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp-Jw-5Kx8k)\\], Rick Santelli notes a large Acra dump of Tech ETFs by a single seller.  Someone with tens of bills if not more decided on a casual Thursday mid-morning sale of what was enough to shake up the confidence of the entire tech industry and market as large that you saw continued Friday.\n\nSo we're in a late stage market where we all raise eye brows on any growth company that has a lower than 75 P/E since they clearly don't give a fuck about growing enough like a good little baby company should. Kinda sketchy but hey shit is going to keep going up right?  Based on how a 2% down day wiped people here, clearlying you're not YOLOing but actually FOMOing in disguise and what I'm here to diagnose you with is the FOMO on how America is shitting on just about every country's economy right now but you've too stupid to know anything aside from SPY and QQQ/TQQQ. At least you're smart enough to not know UDOW. Even then, did you know QQQ holds United Airlines? Imagine how much the CEO had to bribe Invesco to get his shit, stale company listed with the likes of Amazon and Intel.  Congrats on investing in a shit company when what you really just want is AMD/MSFT/Alphabet etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not going to go any more indepth on American economic supremacy than stating the thesis: \n\n*Institutional capital flight from uncertain and poor yielding foreign markets is causing a massive cash influx. With factors such as foreign dollar denominated debt and the race to the bottom in terms of other country's attempts at devaluing their currency to have competitive export pricing relative to their shit quality exports, the USD is overly buoyant. With a size-queen president who bullies the federal chairman into doing his bidding cuz he's going for a high score in the game of the stock market just like us with our portfolios,  we are in a perpetual state of tits not being able to go up in the U.S. stock market. Given ETFs (particularly market cap weighted) receive a bulk of this capital flight, it causes a deanchoring of intrinsic price vs market price i.e. price discovery is less-existent than before, leaving one exposed and not agile enough against algos to sudden market moves resulting in getting fucked in the ass repeatedly even when they do find a nice little value stock to play with. Also value stock seekers are just bears in disguise don't let them fool you.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat doesn't mean there won't be sector specific pullbacks like what mr. money bags caused on Thursday morning. So why be 100% in TQQQ if you want to capture American growth?  Lot of chinese shit on there anyways like lmao NIO.  It's an all NASDAQ ETF, they'll let anyone with 50k post a ticker and place a holding company in US lands to try to claw some of their country's cash back.  But yeah, stocks are going up duh, so how do you not die during these pullbacks decided by people who are called 'sir' by their staff?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Leveraged Currency ETFs**: (Examples:  $YCS 2x short yen,  $DEUR 4x long usd vs euro )\n\nLot of things to note with these.  A lot of them are thinly traded so feel free to get fucked placing a market order.  A lot of them have thin options so understand you're trading with market makers so if you place an order at ask and get cold feet the next day, yes you will be selling at bid and Citadel thanks you for the 60 bucks or whatever. I have read the prospectus of a few of these and note for the 4x leveraged ones they try to replicate one day at a time worth of value change at one specific time.  So it won't be constantly rebalancing through the day which is a plus.  However it also suffers even greater from the 5% off of 100 = 95 and then the next day it gains back 5% but oh look you're not at 100 you're 99.75 or some shit, so volatile markets they naturally decay very quick.  Sustained progression in one direction not so much which is what we are betting on.\n\n**Leveraged Country/Regions ETFs**: (Example: $YANG 3x bear china, $EPF 2x bear Euro, $ARGT 1x long argentina i.e. buy puts lmao)\n\nSo China people still eat bat soup and spread infections due to it.  Worse are the westerners who believe that story and controlled state media when the penalties for those who break from the party line is sitting beside some Uighurs in a concentration camp in Xinjiang.  There are a lot of good ones in particular YANG but as you start looking at specific countries they thin out.  Germany has some good ones to buy puts on as when they start to falter it will be magnified by the low hanging fruit countries in the Eurozone. ARGT up there in the example is non-existent for options but hey be a market maker for a day and buy a leap and be the only open interest on all of CBOE for an ETF. Oh fun fact did you know that you receive a fine of 500k in Argentina if you use your own inflation figures and not the governments?  Find countries like that and short them as all their smart money is leaving the minimum legally required in their countries (looking at you Japan), and investing in shitty US companies (looking at you SoftBank) as they elected their shit leadership in the first place.  Also buying puts against the Africa ETF is racist but please look at the portfolio holdings; the Van Eyck one is nearly all South Africa which weirdly enough is not a representative market of some Tacoma driving, AK47 brandishing warlords in Nigeria cutting off petroleum exports from West Africa.  I also just learned West Africa isn't even a country yet South Africa is!  Wild as fuck this planet we live on!\n\nTreasury ETFs:\n\nTLT the only one you need until the Fed really start printing cash pushing up short term interest rates but given other countries are in the negatives we will probably keep pushing our rates lower meaning the instrinsic value of long dated ones will be worth more.  Gonna be honest these are kinda boring.\n\n**Leveraged Treasury ETF**s:\n\nTMF is TLT's daddy that spits in your mom's mouth when giving her anal in your childhood bed.  It's 3x that so you might actually be able to retire rich.\n\n**Leveraged Volatility** (Example: UVXY, TVIX)\n\nUse these sparingly.  They are kinda gay in that they have a high correlation with shit like TQQQ going down but they do spike in world events which is cool because America may still be the bees knees but just because Russia invaded China doesn't mean our economy isn't going to do anything other than prosper long term selling weapons to both sides - so why get cucked when TQQQ goes down due to it even though most of NASDAQ will just sell robot tank truck AI CRM shared-work-space packages and make more money.\n\nSo feel free to keep losing half your portfolio every down 2% down day or realize that while you intrinsically understand America is doing super good right now, you just don't know how to capture it aside from the same three ETFs that get talked about on here ad nauseum.  Here are a few more for u to lose money on also. Oh also don't use futures or do it whatever idc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk thank you for coming to my Ted Talk if you read that all just know you took advice from someone with 4k in their portfolio, so positions as always:\n\n [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Klimt-missionaires-02.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Klimt-missionaires-02.jpg)", "created_utc": 1582417722, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f81n09/uncertain_of_tech_but_certain_of_the_usa_exit/", "is_self": true}
