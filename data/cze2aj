{"id": "cze2aj", "title": "Softbank and UBER. I don't think they like losing money. A small look into their past investment with IRBT.", "selftext": "So awhile back on july 25 2017 Softbank invested into IRBT. The stock spiked up 25% as a result. But then it started sinking soon after that for no reason. It took about a year for it to recover after that. But it has been very volatile.\n\nAnd now they invested money with UBER, at a price of $48 per share.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/03/softbank-more-than-600-million-underwater-on-uber.html\n\n\nConspiracy theory time:\nI suspect that there might be hedgefunds taking advantage of softbank's investment to make money. That they purposely lower the price of their investments to push the stock down, and wait for the rebound, which softbank might cause itself.\n\nIf you have enough money you can manipulate any company like you can a penny stock. So I believe there is a money game going on with some high profile companies when they make extra large investments. Just because they know how confident they are in the company and will refuse to let the company or their investment die.\n\nSo in saying this I believe Uber will become a very volatile stock for the next year or so and even shoot up to around $60 temporary to allow softbank to recoup their investment.", "created_utc": 1567560417, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cze2aj/softbank_and_uber_i_dont_think_they_like_losing/", "is_self": true}
