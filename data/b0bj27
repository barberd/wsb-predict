{"id": "b0bj27", "title": "Some shitty DD (EVH)", "selftext": "Alright you autist here it goes. Evolent Health creates software for [value-based healthcare](https://catalyst.nejm.org/what-is-value-based-healthcare/) providers. Founded in 2011 under the wing of UPMC which has 36 hospitals internationally and does $16billion in revenue. The stock is down 56% since about the October recession and I believe its nearing its bottom. Recently, legislation in Kentucky is fucking one of evolents partners, Passport, and is cutting their funding which makes the company believe they will become insolvent within the first half of 2019. Passport accounted for 17.5% of evolents 2018 revenue but this news has been around and I believe its priced in. Even if you exclude passport from evolents 2018 revenue, the company would still have increased from their 2017 levels by about 19%. Evolent charges per patient in their data systems on top of premiums for specific hospitals and they currently have 35 contracts with different healthcare providers; 10 of these contracts were added in 2018. They have about 3.5 million patients in their system and Passport only accounts for 315k of them. Current book value puts their shares at $13.89. Evolent has effectively come closer and closer to turning profitable as their operating profit margin has increased annually since 2014. Heres some shitty [TA](https://imgur.com/a/EF9T7vO) as well. The recent sell off from $14 to $12 seems to be off of low volume and it looks like its also getting picked up at these levels. \n\nDisclaimer: am retard", "created_utc": 1552416952, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b0bj27/some_shitty_dd_evh/", "is_self": true}
