Why the fuck does that matter? What makes their toothpaste any better than the hundreds of toothpaste brands that already exist in walmart? Why does that make them suddenly profitable? This company's claim to fame was 3d printing retainers and fucking it up tremendously.\n\nAn analyst has a price target of 20$????? Due to selling toothpaste at walmart?\n\nI've never wanted to short something as hard as this stupid company. But im scared to touch it, like the other guy who tried shorting that garbage RV company and got fucked by institutional investors controlling the stock price.\n\nThis is a scam company run by the spoiled shit son of a millionaire. Its only a matter of time before it goes tits up, maybe wait until march for their earnings call.", "created_utc": 1578332956, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ekxhy9/sdc_is_up_23_on_analyst_pump_and_horseshit/", "is_self": true}
