And Jumia has positioned themselves with presences in the most rapidly developing African countries. It opened with a market cap of about 1.5 billion and I believe that leaves a lot of room to grow due to a total population of over 665 million people in the countries in which it currently fulfills orders. \n\nAlso an annectodal piece of DD is that my neighbor is the daughter of Nigerian immigrants. He says that literally every single one of his cousins who are still in Nigeria use it for their online shopping.\n\nI'm long Jumia, what do you guys think?", "created_utc": 1555083632, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bcf0eh/jumia_ipo_the_next_amazonmercadolibre/", "is_self": true}
