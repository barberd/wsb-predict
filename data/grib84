My daily routine for the successful traders", "selftext": "\nRecently one of the bears asked if no fap is legit because he hasn\u2019t seen results after one week of not nutting to his mom\u2019s wedding photos, so I decided to share the key to success in this industry.\n\nFor the last couple of weeks I went full Chad mode:\n\n- Workout at 5:30 am. Quick meditation & mandatory cold shower after.\n- Quick breakfast at Tim Hortons after. Obligatory Beyond Meat sandwich in the morning to support my company\u2019s balance sheet and 210m sales guidance. \n- Jerking off to my calls before the market opens. It helps me achieve clarity and relaxation before a successful trading day. Right after that, the first round of scotch to celebrate another win.\n- Fuck random bear\u2019s wife at 9:50 am pump.\n- Nap at 11 am (with open positions because I\u2019m certain of the continuous growth of the American economy).\n- 11:45 am. Ensuring the stability and prosperity of our country by posting due diligence across all kinds of forums. Encouraging people to make money by buying call options or even shares. Supporting certain groups such as the Tanker Gang, the Cloud Gang, or $DIS 140c 6/19. \n- 1:15 pm. A usual attempt to sell put options to naive individuals, mostly retarded bears.\n- 1:16 pm. Jerking off to my sold puts and literally free money.\n- The second round of scotch at 1:30 pm. The only thing I eat at this hour is the capital on the opposing end of my trades. Sometimes some Beyond Meat\u2019s sausages. \n- Golf with my bull friends, 2:00 pm. We usually put our phones away and try to enjoy nature and human relationships. We are not worried about our colossal positions as we take EOD pump for granted. The third, fourth and fifth round of scotch for the day.\n- Saving my calories intake by taking my beautiful wife to Dorsia for a healthy dinner, then having long-lasting and pleasurable sex. \n- 8:30 pm. Cold shower, quantitive analysis of the market, inversing Warren Buffet.\n- Occasionally messing with bears by posting funny pictures on the internet and asking how their puts are doing. It\u2019s important to bully retards and ensure that no one bets against the greatest economy in the world. \n- Jerk off to achieve clarity before going into REM cycle, meditation, and the last round of scotch. \n\nRepeat. Repeat. Repeat.\n\nThus, retard, no - no fap is not legit.", "created_utc": 1590580373.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/grib84/the_full_bullchad_schedule_my_daily_routine_for/", "is_self": true}
