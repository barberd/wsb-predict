{"id": "djbmvm", "title": "Calls ROKU, Puts BYND, Calls China", "selftext": "ROKU - As my post from yesterday suggested, ROKU is in its bullish cycle again. Two days ago, the 11% green days is spilling over its bullish effects to today. The green run might continue for another day or two before another 4-5 dollar pull back and another green run. $135/$140/$145 Calls 10/25. Hesistant about running this into ER but we shall see. Analyst upgrades are a good sign as well as the Apple TV integration.\n\nBYND - This overly pumped fake meat company should have been dead at the start of its IPO. -23% bleed in the last month looks great for the bear. This bearish sentiment will continue to drive the stock downhill with increased competition. BYND has no novelty or special product whatsoever =&gt; competition is not a good thing for them.\n\nCalls on China, mainly BABA, JD, and Tencent. GDP release will probably not have any direct effect, but bullish sentiments will likely drive these stocks up a couple percent. \n\nLet me know what you guys think!", "created_utc": 1571341802, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/djbmvm/calls_roku_puts_bynd_calls_china/", "is_self": true}
