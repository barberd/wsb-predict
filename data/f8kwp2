{"id": "f8kwp2", "title": "Worse than Great Depression 2.0", "selftext": "During the Great Depression, GDP contracted by About 5% in 1930. During the Great Recession of 2008, the gdp declined by 1-2% globally.\n\nIf the world has to quarantine by a month, that is a 6-8% drop in GDP for this year. That is assuming firms don\u2019t contract or go bust. It\u2019s been a month now and people are still not returning to work. Chinese banks are state owned, the gov can force the banks to roll over. what happens to private banks around the world as this thing becomes a global pandemic when people don\u2019t pay? Massive layoffs and restricting and bankruptcies will follow. I would be surprised if the stock market either Tanks 80% globally or central banks print so much your money becomes toilet paper as a result. You should be loading up on puts and VIX calls so you can take your gains and acquire gold, farmland, bullets and food. \n\nYou are staring at the depth of the greatest recession of mankind in modern times.", "created_utc": 1582514182, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f8kwp2/worse_than_great_depression_20/", "is_self": true}
