{"id": "g6pehn", "title": "Shopify: A Poor Man's Amazon", "selftext": "$SHOP has been on an astronomical tear (+80% rise doubling its market cap) over the last month benefiting from the recent $AMZN run and a perceived uplift from brick-and-mortar retailers shifting to online. Let's take a closer look as to why this is a short at these price levels.\n\n# How Shopify Makes Money\n\n*1) Subscription Solutions (\\~40% of total revenues)*\n\nSale of subscription services to host a website. $SHOP offers different pricing plans depending on need ranging from $29 to a few thousand a month. The more merchants that enroll on the platform or upgrade to a premium plan, the higher the revenues.\n\n*2) Merchant Solutions (\\~60% of total revenues)*\n\nThe majority of this bucket is payment and transaction fees. In order words, $SHOP takes a cut of the gross merchandise volume processed on the platform. The more sales processed, the higher the revenues.\n\n# What Shopify Sells\n\nDiscretionary products. Think apparel & footwear, beauty & personal care, home furnishings and your cousin's million dollar dropship idea . Example of brands on the platform include:\n\n* Apparel: Kith, GymShark, Allbirds, Steve Madden, Chubbies\n* Beauty: Kylie Jenner Cosmetics, Jeffrey Star Cosmetics, ColourPop\n* Other: Nestle, Staples, Haus, Bullet Proof Coffee, Bombas Socks\n   * [Other examples of \"SMBs\" stores](https://twitter.com/ShopifySupport/status/1252907509079252992)\n\nFuture online sales trends will align to specific industries based on consumer concerns and needs. Brands on the $SHOP platform are for the most part consumer discretionary spending, not *essential*.\n\n# Recent, Concerning Events\n\n* Press release on April 1 saying they will meet/slightly beat Q1 guidance on the strong momentum of \"January and February.\" Also, suspend full year 2020 guidance.\n   * Why no mention of March or suspend guidance?\n* Extending a 90-day free trial to all new standard plan signups\n   * Originally was 14-days. Short-term users will be up but they will not generate revenue from subscription (for at least 1Q) and how many will actually stay on the platform past the trial?\n* Offering a [\"Pause\"](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/your-account/pause-close-store) plan. If merchants are having difficulty meeting the monthly plan fee, for just $9 (was lowered from $14 a few days ago) $SHOP will pause the store but that merchant cannot make sales\n   * Why would a merchant continue to pay an expense if they can't generate revenue?\n* CTO tweets they are experiencing Black Friday traffic and that may double\n   * Of course traffic will be up since users are creating new stores. No surprise there but since when does traffic equate to sales?\n   * This same CTO also filed an Intent to Sell form on March 23 for 13,000 shares or roughly $8.5mm at current share price levels.\n* More than 27,000 discount codes have been recently created\n   * Indicates merchants are trying to boost sales by heavily discounting\n* Recent social media postings pushing merchants to [\"pivot\"](https://twitter.com/Shopify/status/1250899717837533184)\n   * Why pivot into something else if sales are great? Why push other ancillary items like gift cards or pay to view online classes?\n\n# Catalysts\n\nI won't even dive into the multiples but SHOP needs to show growth to make its current/future valuation work. I expect Q1 to be in-line or a slight beat per their press release. Stock may also rise from $AMZN reporting positive results next week. Q2/3/4 are where things unfold.\n\n*Subscription revenue*: Should be down/flat as 1) users churn off the platform (already a persisting issue), 2) premium members downgrade their subscription to a more basic plan to cut expenses and 3) new users being offered a 90-free trial. This will be minimally off-set by merchants that successfully stay on the platform past the 90 days but I expect this conversion rate to below (see example of new stores created above).\n\n*Merchant revenue*: Gross merchandise volume processed should be down as the volume processed on the platform declines from discounted or lost sales. This will be minimally off-set by merchants that are experiencing growth in sales (a small minority).\n\nAlso, there a risk of them issuing a secondary (diluting shareholders) to raise cash. They don't need it but you have already seen a majority of companies doing so to \"shore up the balance sheet.\"\n\nShowing flat/to little growth in an environment where they are expected to take share will tank the stock back to pre-Covid levels.\n\n# TL;DR\n\nHorrible macroeconomic backdrop setting in. A platform that does not sell any essential products. Volatile stock that has little upside given recent massive run-up but major downside risk if they miss revenue growth.\n\n**Position: Jan 15 2021 300 P**", "created_utc": 1587658049.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6pehn/shopify_a_poor_mans_amazon/", "is_self": true}
