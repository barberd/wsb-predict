{"id": "ff3z0c", "title": "OPK possibility mooning next week like INO, APT, and CODX as OPK were granted approval from the CDC", "selftext": "I like to keep it short and simple as much as I can with these bullets:\n\n* OPK said on March 5th that it would offer a testing for the coronavirus, with its subsidiary expecting to receive specimens of the virus for its own use in the coming week.\n* OPK possibility test would become availability soon as they gotten in touch with the Central for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) set the stage for the company to file for approval, and Trump recently visited the CDC most likely to contain the virus and offer testing kits across the U.S quickly as we greatly low in demand.\n* OPK only recently moon this week from 1.54$ share price to all time high this week 2.79$. Currently it's at 2.32$. **Their all time highest reached at 17.68$ in 2015-2016 from approval of the ZIKA virus news**. They have history of approval with CDC.\n* I believe there's a possibility for a small growth this upcoming week if everything goes well with OPK and still a bit early to get in as the price dropped on Friday, which I bought in at 2.60$, but I believe this will not trend downwards this coming up week.\n* Let me know on your thoughts on OPK\n\n \n\nReferences:\n\n[Biotech Forum Daily Digest: OPKO Gets Early FDA Approval, Zika Virus Again In The News, Spotlight On XBiotech](https://seekingalpha.com/article/3983609-biotech-forum-daily-digest-opko-gets-early-fda-approval-zika-virus-again-in-news-spotlight-on)\n\n[Stock Market Wrap-Up: Coronavirus Hopes Lift Inovio, OPKO](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stock-market-wrap-up%3A-coronavirus-hopes-lift-inovio-opko-2020-03-06)\n\n[Trump Visits CDC After Coronavirus Fears Throw Schedule Into Chaos](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/06/812825943/trump-signs-coronavirus-funding-bill-cancels-trip-to-cdc)\n\n[Opko Health Announces It Will Offer Coronavirus Test](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/opko-health-coronavirus-test)\n\nMy Positions:\n\nShort Term for next week news - OPK 3$ call 03/13\n\nMid term to play it safe - OPK 3$ call 04/03", "created_utc": 1583625372, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ff3z0c/opk_possibility_mooning_next_week_like_ino_apt/", "is_self": true}
