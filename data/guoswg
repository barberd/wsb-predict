Even with the assassination of both MLK and JFK, H3N2 killing 100k Americans (dang), and the Tet Offensive, the S&P rallied to finish the year *up* 7.6%. \n\nMy two cents, with only a cursory mention of the profound effects of QE. Even though the dynamic of bulls vs bears, or, more generally, optimists vs pessimists is what drives the world and all sorts of pricing, the market is inherently trading on the future. Deep down, most humans have a difficult time imagining things getting worse than the worst (like in the seminal *Schindler's List*), and we see any positive development as the possibility of a turnaround. Furthermore, shorts are generally short term trades while longs can be eternal. Compounded by the inherent inflation of valuation, the market improves over time. What will be most interesting to see if/when real inflation catches up with market inflation, since all of this QE is mostly shifting liquidity into the equities market. \n\nIn my opinion, disconnect like this presents a great opportunity for us to reap as investors/traders/autists/motherfuckers. My $1 in the market is inflating faster than my $1 in the real world. Imagine the economy as a loaf of bread, and the market as a separate loaf of bread. A loaf of economy bread costs $1 today, $1.01 tomorrow, $1.02 the day after. Meanwhile, a loaf of  market bread costs $1 today, 1.015 tomorrow, and 1.03 the day after. I take my money and buy a loaf of market bread. I sell it after a while since it's virtual bread and I can't eat that shit. Now I take that money and buy some economy bread that I can eat, but magically, I'm getting more bread.\n\nObviously this is just some nonsense rambling because I want some sourdough.", "created_utc": 1591032428.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/guoswg/cnbc_draws_intersting_parallels_between_1968_and/", "is_self": true}
