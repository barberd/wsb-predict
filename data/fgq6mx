Look out for NET", "selftext": "If you search Cloudflare right now, all the algo sites are talking about how their lock up ends tomorrow 3/11.\n\nBut if you check their actual SEC filing, the lock up actually already ended on Feb 19.\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1477333/000147733320000004/net202002138k.htm\n\nFeb 19 is when the stock started mooning (11.35 % in one day). Ergo, same thing going to happen tomorrow.\n\nThey have the highest market share (35.7%) of anybody in the CDN space and they are just going to keep improving on that.\n\nhttps://www.datanyze.com/market-share/cdn--10\n\nYou know what happens to companies that beat out Google and Amazon in marketshare? Google and Amazon have a bidding war to buy them out.  Competition is for capitalists, not monopolies like Google and Amazon. Which is why it might be way smarter long term to hold shares as opposed to calls in case of an acquisition.\n\nHowever, in the short term, calls seem especially juicy. Tech stocks have been taking a beating, and for the most part, NET was largely unaffected. When INO finally announces a cure and saves the world, tech will come roaring back, and NET will likely ride the coattails to tendieland. \n\nAlso just to be serious for a moment, one of their cofounders has a disease called Frontotemporal Dementia, as outlined in their S-1.\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1477333/000119312519222176/d735023ds1.htm\n\nFrontotemporal Dementia = FD = 3/20 30$\n\nTLDR: Cloudflare is the backbone of the internet.
