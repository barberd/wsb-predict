With asset values this inflated, there are unrealistic expectations that holders will be able to redeem shares at their present prices. When a shock places stress on the credit system and leads a rise in redemptions/withdrawals, many funds will struggle to sell assets to meet the demand for liquidity. In a serious crisis, a liquidity shock can propagate through the entire system, leading to a spike in spreads and credit freezing up. This will place a lot of strain on funds that rely on short-term borrowing and issuers of high-yield debt who currently act as if risk-free refinancing at rock-bottom rates is a fact of nature.\n\nBasel III regulations, which have made primary banks less vulnerable to instantaneous collapse due to financial contagion, also limit their ability to provide liquidity to other parts of the system, hence the huge rise in non-bank lending. The spike in repo rates that forced the Fed's intervention was an example of big banks not responding to liquidity demand even though the problem was known about months in advance. The Fed is going to do everything it can to pump as much liquidity into the system as possible, but it's an open question whether:\n\n1. The normal liquidity channel of big banks lending to smaller banks and funds will function properly (chances are high they won't)\n2. The Fed will pump enough liquidity into the system beforehand to cushion the initial run on credit (chances are high they won't)\n\nAll of this means that the crisis will offer opportunities for serious volatility plays on indexes/assets that are going to be under a lot of stress. In particular, I see nominally-liquid funds tied to illiquid underlying assets absolutely tanking until the Fed provides an adequate backstop months after the implosion.\n\n**tl;dr: the crash this time is going to create a liquidity crisis, not a solvency crisis, leading to fire sales by funds facing heavy withdrawals. wait for the trigger and place puts accordingly.**", "created_utc": 1572200313, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dnxayt/baby_bears_learn_this_chart/", "is_self": true}
