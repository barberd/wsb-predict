DD inside", "selftext": "Hello I just opened up (two positions)[\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/gdAj8nS] and i was kind of wondering specifically how my call on a microsoft position would be if it ended up working out. So I bought the call at a strike price? (i think is called) for 190 at $1.06/share thinking it would go up another 40% this year to next september. Now if by september next year, the stock goes well past $190, I will be deep ITM and thatd be a good time to sell? But if it just meets the bare minimum, I will still be ITM but I will barely have profit correct? When is theoretically the best time as well to sell my positions? Thanks soon I will be one of us.", "created_utc": 1573037498, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dseob8/aspiring_autist_here_how_do_options_work_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
