Today I didn't color code the calls/puts    but did color code the  companies.\n\nThese  options orders  are on or above the ask. Many have the same expiry and  strike. Also lots  of the orders were sweeps so these ppl were breaking  down their order  to get filled faster.\n\nAlso  all  these orders volume of the contracts exceeded the open interest in   multiple trades so it's most likely not closing positions. Either  buy     to  open orders or sell to open orders and based on the  aggressiveness  of the orders one can infer its buy to open. Some of   these may be    hedges  and some most likely not.\n\nData is here -[https://ibb.co/kHNvhLc](https://ibb.co/kHNvhLc)\n\nThe HAL calls seem out of the ordinary.  For puts, watch PENN, PTON, and WYNN.\n\nI  will say this, don't just enter into positions based on this data      alone in most cases. Use  technicals/fundamentals/options   data-flow/market  sediment all combined  instead of just 1 of these. Use      protection like  spreads if you worry  about losing what u put in   and    be  smart,  understand the risks of putting  $ into weekly   expiry's, consider a longer expiry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso with the market going lower use technicals/fundamentals/options   data-flow/market  sediment all combined", "created_utc": 1582747004, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9z4bs/aggressiveunusual_options_pennptonwynnmsft/", "is_self": true}
