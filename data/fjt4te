{"id": "fjt4te", "title": "$TQQQ options were auto-exercised, resulting in a $51,570.75 cash call in my Roth IRA ($15,750 realized loss)", "selftext": "Don't ever let somebody tell you that the most you can lose when buying a call option is 100% of your money, you can lose much more that with long call options if you are clever enough. This all went down on Friday the 13th. I was being a good little autist, with a sizable portion of my portfolio in TQQQ puts expiring 3/20, and a handful of calls expiring 3/13 that I was planning on unloading after the end of market rally.\n\nIt was all going according to plan. Sometime in the afternoon I paid a meager $80 for 10 contracts of TQQQ 56c expiring in like 2 hours. It was deep out of the money still, so they were only $0.08, and I got a few other positions at $52, $53, $54, and $55.\n\nI sold them all over the course of the rally, they were gonna expire at the end of the day, and I made a few thousand off the trades. I don't know how much, because it doesn't fucking matter anymore. Now, E\\*TRADE had been getting laggy as fuck towards the end of the day, as I'm sure most online platforms were at the time, so unfortunately I wasn't able to place an order to close out the $56c in time. It expired. Rats, I'm out $840 of intrinsic value, too bad.\n\nI had been closing other positions out too, and I had about $4,400 in my account at the end of the day, which I was expecting to settle today, and was preparing to trade on the bigly swings today, and not be cucked into oblivion as I have found myself.\n\nSo I went to sleep Friday night and all was well with my portfolio.\n\nArise Saturday morning, and I check my account to see this fucking banner on my portfolio:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pljmsqucs3n41.png?width=763&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c4df4c0bec84fd1eb85ec0e673f3044fde0e4a4\n\nSo APPARENTLY the default measure for expiring in-the-money options is for them to be exercised, and even if the options holder does not have nearly enough cash on hand to cover the share purchases, since nobody put a Do Not Exercise order on the option, it got exercised and my account was charged $56,000.\n\nSo I call up E\\*TRADE and they say \"wowo that sux sry\" and I tell them about how I was getting fucked by the laggy servers so I couldn't put in a sell to close order in time, causing it to expire. We'll see how they take that, the inquiry is still pending.\n\nThey gave me two choices, I can either sell the soon-to-be-not-worth-$56k shares at market open, or I can fucking let it ride and potentially take additional damages if the inquiry doesn't come back in my favor. So since they already have my vas deferens in a vice, I figure I'm out of bargaining power, and 7:00 am rolls around and E\\*TRADE pre-market opens and I sell those fuckers at $40.25 each.\n\nSo I realized a $15,750 loss on that whole fucking debacle, and since I only had $4,400 cash in the account and the rest of my portfolio was worth less than the remainder, this is now how my account looks.\n\n[I don't give a fuck if you see the 4 digits of my account number, you can hack my negative balance if you want to](https://preview.redd.it/kcc53r5st3n41.png?width=925&format=png&auto=webp&s=70fb433f9b52ab4583e4d0fb97bad648453d2678)\n\nThere's only one open position that can save me now, and it's responsible for most of that unrealized gain, and is the reason my account isn't at -$6k like it was earlier this afternoon.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e18nufw8u3n41.png?width=810&format=png&auto=webp&s=9524c806a8f475f6ab400a63f1900c66509f99dc\n\nSo I am holding on to these fuckers until they are in the money, or until I have to call up a tax attorney to figure out how to transfer more cash than I have allowable contributions into an IRA to cover a debt.\n\nJust got off the phone with them again to hopefully get an update, didn't sound promising, the guy said I can expect a call back tomorrow or Wednesday. Great, as long as nothing happens to the markets until then...\n\nEdit: Just did the math, realizing a $15,750 loss on a $80 play is a cool -18,496%, bet you cant do that!\n\ntl;dr I bought $80 worth of options that expired $840 in the money and got exercised for $56,000 of stock in an account valued around \\~$10k, now I'm clinging on by the skin of my taint", "created_utc": 1584395317.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjt4te/tqqq_options_were_autoexercised_resulting_in_a/", "is_self": true}
