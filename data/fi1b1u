Not even a little autistic, this attempt at DD was done out of spite. \n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/8pHTqTg\n\n1) they pulled out of their last very recent bankruptcy by acquiring podcasts of all things\n\n2) huge operating costs for physical broadcast stations. Giant debt. Low income. \n\n3) most of their money has to be from local promotions advertising. Airtime will get cheap as shit when small businesses can\u2019t pay. Ad contracts are short term. No events, no concerts, nothing at all to promote. Big ad players will take the opportunity to drive the price down on significant contracts. \n\n4) all of their profit streams are weak. They hold tons of shit radio for every 1 popular station that exists. 24 hour jazz CANNOT be profitable. They hold a lot of European billboards which can\u2019t be worth anything now. Podcasts are 10 years ago. \nXM radio stopped being a good idea when cell phones improved even slightly. \n\n5) the only secure revenue stream I can find is in shared cell towers with shit companies. \n\n666) their programming is extremely stale. Who the fuck listens to the radio? Old people who are going to die and people with no other options at work. Anyone with any sense would listen to anything else. Ad time will cut even further into broadcast time to make up what they can. \n\nAgain, tell me I\u2019m don\u2019t possess your Sperglord ability and I won\u2019t be offended. There are probably things I haven\u2019t considered. \n\nI just want to watch it burn, I don\u2019t care about gambling on it. I honestly think they could go bankrupt.", "created_utc": 1584113008.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fi1b1u/iheart_media/", "is_self": true}
