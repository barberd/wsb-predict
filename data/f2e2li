{"id": "f2e2li", "title": "Strategy to never lose money", "selftext": "Everyone loves writing uncovered puts right? I sure do. But the one thing i worry about is the stock dropping below the strike price and having the option exercised, which would result in a loss of money (not good). The solution is to create an order to short 100 shares per contract at the contract\u2019s strike price. You would also need to create an order to close the short position once the stock rises back to the strike price. So that means if the stock dips below the strike price, you make back all the money you would lose from the option on the short. If it never dips below the strike price, the short order is never executed, and you keep the credit from selling the contract, and the option expires worthless.\n\nFor example: You write and sell an $ACB (currently at $1.58) put with a strike price of $1.50 expiring 2/14 and receive $9 in credit assuming your contract is bought. You would also create an order that would short 100 shares of ACB at $1.50. Lets say $ACB goes down to $1.40 on or before the expiration date. Your short option opens at $1.50 and you make $10 from the short contract (($1.50-$1.40)x 100 shares). But at the same time the put you sold is exercised, forcing you to buy 100 shares of $ACB at $1.5, closing the short contract with no net gain or loss. If the share price stays over the strike price, the option won\u2019t be exercised and you keep the credit from selling the option. \n\nNow this might be extremely retarded, so if you see any flaws with my idea drop a comment with your thoughts.", "created_utc": 1581451565, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f2e2li/strategy_to_never_lose_money/", "is_self": true}
