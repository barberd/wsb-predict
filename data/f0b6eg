My personally modeled price target is $25 based upon the guidance hints from the video.  All in on PRPL warrants (PRPLW)!\n\nJoe Megibow, CEO of Purple (PRPL), gave an interview at the recent Silicon Slopes conference.\n\n[The video.  No reading required.](https://www.nasdaq.com/videos/silicon-slopes%3A-joe-megibow-ceo-purple)\n\nA few key things we learn from the video:\n\n1. They are selling all of their manufacturing capacity ([this was known previously](https://www.barrons.com/articles/casper-ipo-rival-purple-mattresses-51579819162)).\n2. They expect a **100%** increase in manufacturing capacity (this is higher than expected--half comes online early in the year and half later--only 40% more machines were disclosed in the last earnings call--80% more machines were disclosed in the Barron's interview on 1/24, but no consensus estimates have been updated since and the stock growth was aligned with Casper news).\n3. PRPL expects to sell into all of the increase in manufacturing capacity (!!!).\n4. PRPL is pulling back relatively on its DTC channel (which has less contribution margin than wholesale) and allowing the new capacity to sell into their wholesale channel.  This will drop significantly more cash to the bottom line than is currently expected.\n\nIn other interesting notes on the video, Joe is clearly separating Purple as a company from the dumpster fire that Casper (CSPR) is by emphasizing the fact that they have actually unique technology and that they are the manufacturer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Actuals (MM)|2019 Q3|2019 Q2|2019 Q1|2018 Q4|2018 Q3|2018 Q2|2018 Q1|2017 Q4|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Revenue|$117.4|$103.0|$83.6|$78.5|$70.8|$75.8|$60.8|$63|\n|YoY %|65.8%|36.0%|37.7%|24.5%|26.4%|58.1%|102.4%|156.1%|\n||||||||||\n|Adj EBITDA|$15.3|$6.2|$6.2|$(3.7)|$(2.7)|$(3.5)|$(0.8)|$(3.2)|\n|Net Income|$8.4|$(7.3)|$(0.7)|$(5.4)|$(4.4)|$(5.6)|$(4.3)|$(4.6)|\n\nA 100% run-rate growth on manufacturing units with almost full sell through is a drastic acceleration to this business.   Wholesales sales will bring in less revenue per sale, but if you've been listening to earnings calls, the wholesale channel is drastically more profitable for them.  Wholesale sales were 16% of revenue in 2018, 38% in Q2 and 42% in Q3.  \n\n[Forward Looking Consensus Estimates](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/PRPL/earnings/)  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n||2019 Q3|2019 Q4|2020 Q1|2020 Q2|2020 Q3|2020 Q4|2021 Q1|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Consensus Estimate|$0.02|$0.04|$0.16|$0.04|$0.26|$0.06||\n|Actual EPS|$0.16||||||Moon!|\n|Rev YoY %|65.8%|???|???|???|???|***100%***||\n\nPRPL hasn't had a large analyst or press following.  This has increased since Casper (CSPR) went through its IPO process over the last few weeks.  This is an opportunity to get into a stock that will have many more eyes on the upcoming ER, but with a consensus estimate that is clearly underestimated based upon what Joe has shared in the video.\n\n[From the Q3 2019 Earnings Call:](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/11/07/purple-innovation-inc-prpl-q3-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx)\n\nPurple is actively growing its wholesale business and occupies 1,400 wholesale doors total from the following retailers:\n\n* Mattress Firm (3,420 locations total--great relationship here and expansion has been limited by manufacturing capacity--PRPL is only in 800 per Q3 call)\n* Macy's (770 locations total -&gt; reducing by 125)\n* Bloomingdales (38 locations total)\n* Furniture Row (330 locations total)\n* Home (188 locations total)\n* Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (1,024 locations total)\n\nPer the Q3 2019 Earnings Call Q&amp;A, PRPL is balancing opening new doors with existing partners based upon available manufacturing capacity.\n\nPurple has three of its own locations run as a pilot that have exceeded their own expectations.\n\nFrom the Q&amp;A:  PRPL had a growth in growth margins in Q3 (5.3 points!) that management expects to maintain *at a minimum*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm long PRPL via PRPLW and very bullish.
