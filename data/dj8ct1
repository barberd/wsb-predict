{"id": "dj8ct1", "title": "DD INSIDE - Bullish on $QSR for the next 3 months", "selftext": "TL;DR at the end.\n\nI believe $QSR is due for a sharp price increase over the next 3 months for the following reasons:\n\nFirst it is important to understand what Restaurant Brands International ($QSR) is. This is a joint venture started in 2014 which owns Burger King, Tim Hortons, and Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen. A majority of their holdings consist of BK and TH, and Popeyes is a minority at around 15% of their total restaurants. However, it is important to note that historically Popeyes has been a weak performer for $QSR compared to their other brands but this may have changed for Q3 with their release of a new chicken sandwich which triggered a social media frenzy and resulted in their selling out of the sandwich with Tyson foods unable to keep up with demand.\n\nNow let\u2019s break down by restaurant why $QSR may beat:\n\n- Burger King sales in Q3 May have been driven by Impossible Burger demand as reported [Here](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/16/the-impossible-whopper-is-driving-steady-traffic-to-burger-king-data-shows.html).\n- Popeyes as stated above had a huge demand for their sandwich after its release in August which likely drove up sales quite significantly.\n- Tim Horton\u2019s did not have any driving factors during Q3 which would indicate an increase in sales but there is no reason to believe they will report a decrease either.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at where the stock sits as of today. $QSR has consistently sold off over the past 2 months after setting a new ATH at $78 in late August. The stock now sits in the $69-$70 range, only 3% higher than the stock\u2019s high point in 2017 despite strong growth over the past 2 years. Sell side price targets average near $93 representing over a 30% upside from the current trading price.\n\nOkay so this thing could pop, what play should I chose? Historically, $QSR has not been very volatile so short dated options are probably not the best idea to play earnings. Instead, I would recommend longer dated options expiring in January or later At or Near The Money. Hopefully strong earnings will create demand and drive price higher, which has the potential to short squeeze the stock due to the large short volume which would be forced to cover after such an increase.\n\nIn their earnings call I would expect them to announce strong EPS and Rev while increasing guidance in anticipating the growth of meat alternative products at their restaurants.\n\nTL;DR:\n$QSR may run up to the high 80\u2019s over the next 3 months due to strong performance among their 3 brand holdings in Q3 and a potential short squeeze.", "created_utc": 1571327786, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dj8ct1/dd_inside_bullish_on_qsr_for_the_next_3_months/", "is_self": true}
