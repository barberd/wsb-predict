Confidence is high, testosterone low. In light of this, I\u2019m going to provide not 1, but 2 plays for you all. Please be sure to inverse, as neither of these will be profitable.\n\nPlay # 1: Look yourself in the mirror? Are you someone that gets massive bruises on your inner thighs after a light jog around the neighborhood? This is due to a pair of brass hanging directly under your slightly below average sized. Some people would actually call it average depending on the country. I\u2019ve done the research, I know. Are you allowed to trade futures? If yes to the above, here is the play. You\u2019re going to want to put about $7,000 into /ES 2780p expiring Wednesday. This is and will always be the way. General Cheeto is not going to do well today.\n\nPlay # 2: Are you someone who enjoys risk? Do you enjoy the feeling of knowing that you will probably lose a lot of money on a trade? If yes, then boy do I have the play for you. At open tomorrow, buy $11,000 of AMZN 2300p 4/24. The rational behind this is simple, it\u2019s gone up enough the past week.\n\nTLDR: /ES 2780p 4/22 AMZN 2300p 4/24\n\nThis is the way.\n\n[https://imgur.com/gallery/gVFTJwJ](https://imgur.com/gallery/gVFTJwJ)\n\nAutomod keeps flagging this so TSLA, AMD, SPCE, JNUG, GILD\n\nEdit: Apparently you aren't allowed to write b@llz or p3n15 so I had to take that out but you get the point.", "created_utc": 1587415119.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g50r63/youre_welcome/", "is_self": true}
