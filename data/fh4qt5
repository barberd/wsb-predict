Yes all retail will be hurt but the hurt is temporary.   And as in store sales decline the online sales will increase.  They\u2019ll staff stores with less people and decrease SG&A.  I\u2019m not a buyer yet because market emotion could drop it lower but if this hits $22-23 range I\u2019m putting half my stack in leaps.  Hopefully retail cuts dividends like oil is doing.", "created_utc": 1583962109.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fh4qt5/kohls_contrarian_play/", "is_self": true}
