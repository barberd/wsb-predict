{"id": "bc1hmk", "title": "RAD numerology", "selftext": "Rite Aid posted losses of 1 cent per share when analysts were expecting 2. These are the perfect numbers with which to represent the concept of a half (1/2), and that's very fitting to how they cut the estimate in half, as is having the first two numbers every article about earnings is likely to mention also be the first two numbers of the alphabet of numbers other than zero.\n\nQ4 revenue was $5.38 billion instead of the projected $5.56 billion. 538 is a famous number in America for being how many electors there are for the President. 5.56 is a famous number in America for being a modern rifle round used by militaries and other people worldwide. This is basically Rite Aid's new leadership numerically taking the hippocratic oath and saying the pen is mightier than the sword. They will try to profit by appealing to people and winning the hearts and minds of their customers instead of just slaughtering innocents classic big pharma style. In more down-to-earth terms, they probably focused heavily on cutting costs regardless of impact on revenue in Q4 just to minimize losses so that they could survive and pivot out of their nosedive, and will probably spend the next fiscal year just trying to build a strong brand, spending pretty much all their revenue to that end so that they can build up to another climb instead of just trying to profit this year. \n\nThe reverse stock split has gone through at a 1 to 20 ratio, which is cool because 20 is the highest choice of ratio they had available and also because it's the same number as one of the classic US treasury notes, the Andrew Jackson. By offering to give you 20 shares for 1 share you already have, they're subtly indicating how in the long run they'll give you $20 for giving them 1 dollar you already have.\n\nQuoting CNBC:\n\n&gt; On an unadjusted basis, Rite Aid reported a fiscal fourth-quarter loss of $2**7**3 million, or 26 cents per share, down from a gain of $**7**6**7** million\n\nAs CNBC surely knows and is using the placement of these figures to indicate, a set of 3 sevens in a row means a jackpot. In addition, it's clear the profitability that was getting figures like $767 million was bound to crash soon because that's the same number as one of Boeing's jets and now that Boeing are going the safety-DLC route of business plans it's just a no brainer that you expect some crashes. Hopefully the new leadership at Rite Aid, once they start posting profits, will avoid getting any numbers that might remind the market spirits of Boeing. \n\nOn the WSB inverse recommendation scale, I place this company based on its recent earnings at a 5/5 - Strong Buy Puts.", "created_utc": 1554997949, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bc1hmk/rad_numerology/", "is_self": true}
