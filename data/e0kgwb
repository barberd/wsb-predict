Because everybody is laughing at the truck that will give Treelon millions of $ of free advertisement. (E.g. my grandmother is asking who \"Tesla\" is because of this...)\n\nDue diligence should be done with a parabolic microphone pointed at any Starbucks, playground, public gathering in town, listening to what the socker MILFS and deadbeat teenage vegans are discussing because those retards can now lose their hard earned money trying to strike it rich with shit like $TLRY and $BYND and whatnot, and you could tag along with it... If only we knew that Karen and Mindy wanted a peeburger (yes I spelled it right) you could've been driving countaches, snorting snow of a dead hooker's vomit covered belly right now...\n\nRight now $TSLA is the feelsgood/FOTM stock and you all know it.
