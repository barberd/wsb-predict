Abbott Labs is releasing earnings April 16th, and I believe expectations will be high and they will meet them. Back in February, their last CEO stepped down and a new one stepped up, and he immediately made changes, such as the coronavirus testing kit and beefing up operations. Usually new CEO's tend to impress their first quarter, and I think this stock still stays undervalued at 86$. On top of it, acquired ST. Judes Medical devices, who make a lot of heart monitors, something hospitals desperately need right now with overflowing ICUs. Abbott is making 50,000 testing cartridges a day and selling them for 40$ a pop ($2,000,000 daily). Forward guidance will be IMMACULATE and good ole Abbott labs is gonna print. \n\n\nhttps://www.abbott.com/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI4_zytpzj6AIVhJyzCh2NHwAxEAAYAiAAEgKrAfD_BwE", "created_utc": 1586706027.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fzyvkm/abbott/", "is_self": true}
