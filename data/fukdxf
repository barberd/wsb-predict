There is very little you need to know to be good at making money in the stock market.\n\nFirst, forget the global part of the market. Every company worth investing money lives in NY on the stock exchange. There is stuff like iShares or $INDA or even that Lucky Coffee but it all seems complicated so only buy shit where you recognize the logo from cable TV.\n\nNext, the market either goes up or down but it always goes right.\n\nAlways buy options and never stocks because more gains. Calls if it go up, puts if it go down.\n\nAlways buy options that expire at least 6 months to a year out. Do this fucking always, otherwise your gambling and not printing tendies. If you really feel good about something, do it 4 months out.\n\nDon't buy options anticipating a change of more than 35% ever. Shit don't change like that.\n\nPeople talk about shit like Romans and IV bags and VIX Vaporrub but thats too fucking hard to understand. Just know your option is a hot potato that you must eventually pass even if your right (because your too poor and retarded to excersize it).\n\nThe potato gets hotter and burns up a bit with each day you get closer to end date. Only buy potato's someone else will eventually want because you will always need to pass it. \n\nSell potato for more than you bought potato. \n\nIf a company seems too special or too fucked, buy the opposite type of potato (but if everybody buy the same potatoes don't cause they too expensive)\n\nAlso there are ETFs (don't ask me what this is, I think it's a stock with more steps and some math) that are triple cool and give really lit potatoes like SPXS and SPXL.\n\nDo this and you will get from 3k -> 20k in 5 months w/o having to know what a fucking omega fish oil is.\n\nTodays positions:\n10/16\n$23 SPXL puts\n$21 SPSX calls\n\n01/15/2021\n$145 MCD put\n$10 SNAP put\n$12 SNAP put\n$12 IBN put\n$62.5 SBUX put\n$254 SPY put\n$280 SPY put\n\n01/21/2022\n$24 SPXL call\n$5 LK call\n$52.5 XOM call\n\nBTW, V shaped recovery is in fact a thing. We will be at least 80% of 2020 start by 03/2021. But we will drop big before then.", "created_utc": 1585961880.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fukdxf/understanding_the_complex_global_market_in_terms/", "is_self": true}
