My first big loss was in June 2018 when I doubled, then tripled down on OTM FB $220 calls a few weeks into trading. I went in for a job interview at 3:40 and came out to \"Facebook craters 20%\" headlines. I lost 12k instantly the next morning. Finally made it back 2 years later riding the crash down. VXX calls, SPY, NVDA, AAPL, DAL, RCL puts. After getting fucked last Friday my account briefly said 125k this morning and then immediately froze. I sold everything at open then rebought further out. Enjoy the ride. It has been hilarious. I've learned nothing.
