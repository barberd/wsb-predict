{"id": "e1i7z0", "title": "LONG $WSB VLOGGERS - STATE OF /R/WSB SHITPOSTING - DD", "selftext": "/u/haupt91 **started what I believe will be the next big thing on this sub - for better or for worse.**\n\nHaupt is known as an established player in the market, having enjoyed steady karma revenues quarter to quarter from his consistently high quality gif submissions. Haupt's brand enjoys similar type of loyalty as $AAPL, thanks to gifs that are guaranteed to make you chuckle, with quotes such as \"Beyond Meat? Isn't that a Lesbian book club?\u201d or a random clips of copulating chimpanzees. The market is far from a monopoly though - with new entrants such as /u/Bipedal-Moose, with his memorable \"[Field of Tendies](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/diunpo/field_of_tendies/)\". Over time it\u2019s becoming clear that high quality alone is not enough for /u/haupt91 to distinguish his work - particularly given the generally half-witted population of /r/wallstreetbets who might underappreciate subtle differences between authors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Disruption**\n\nJust over two weeks ago /u/haupt91, following in the footsteps of Steve Jobs (iPad) and Jeff \"Lex Luthor\" Bezos (Kindle), unveiled a new category of a shitpost to the sub - one that does away with the sweet benefits of anonymity in the name of fame among the imbeciles visiting this cursed corner of the internet. With the [WSB YOLO King](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dtf7s0/wsb_yolo_king_lands_interview_on_cnbc/), /u/haupt91 has started a new era of /r/wallstreetbets \\- the era of vlogging.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Origins**\n\nUntil recently, /r/wallstreetbets members preferred not to show their likely unappealing faces - that is until /u/ControlTheNarrative changed the game with his legendary [I recorded today's market-open and the instant delta to my portfolio](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpnzup/i_recorded_todays_marketopen_and_the_instant/) post. His brave move was rewarded with multiple reddit-coin badges, including the $100 dollar \u201cGolden Fuckboy\u201d and 3x GAY awards. The rawness of the video, culminating in the now-famous guttural \u201cguh\u201d sound, puts it firmly in the snuff-film category of /r/wallstreetbets hall of fame. It\u2019s worth noting that /u/ControlTheNarrative didn\u2019t set off to create a meme, or at least seemed to be taken off guard by its popularity. And thus, he quickly lost control of it, with derivative memes coming close to outshining the original - for example u/Orgasimo\u2019s [Say Something I'm GUHving Up on You](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dr3eki/say_something_im_guhving_up_on_you_official_music/). This is in contrast to /u/haupt91 who so far hasn't inspired \"re-mixes\" of his work, but has been much more deliberate in building and controlling his brand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WSBloggers**\n\nThe latest stage of diversification of the /r/wallstreetbets meme economy is represented by /u/Deluja\u2019s post - [\u201cWatch the downfall of Dejula\u201d](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e01t9k/watch_the_downfall_of_dejula/). He skillfully weaved his humorous comments into a clip that on the surface was nothing more than a video version of a loss pic. The budget of the video was approximately $45k - highlighting barriers to entry for potential /r/wallstreetbets vloggers. By my estimates, a vlogger could have a good shot at disrupting the current market with a budget of approx $100k - this would enable five $20k YOLOs (amount that\u2019s likely to attract attention) which could be spread over two quarters. It is my strong belief that /u/Deluja\u2019s video will be remembered as one of the first real /r/wallstreetbets vlogs. He understood that numpties frequenting /r/wallstreetbets have no time for classic youtube-style vloggers, who rarely put their balls on the line - although I have no doubt that many will try to record PG-rated /r/wallstreetbets commentary vlogs, where no money is put at risk. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nI believe this time next year we will have have several established shitposters specialising in video content. With 741k subscribers on /r/wallstreetbets, the addressable audience is large enough to wonder why this hasn\u2019t happened earlier. It\u2019s worth noting that due to high barriers to entry, monetisation won\u2019t be the goal of those shitposters - but lack of monetisation hasn\u2019t dissuaded thousands from visiting this Aleppo of investment forums every day.", "created_utc": 1574698540, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e1i7z0/long_wsb_vloggers_state_of_rwsb_shitposting_dd/", "is_self": true}
