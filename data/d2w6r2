Admittedly this is a bit ridiculous because that would make it one of the highest selling games ever. But I still believe that this game will be a massive success. I want to bet that this will give a TTWO a nice little bump once all the hype gets released, similar to ACTVI with WoW Classic. What do you guys think? Also TTWO is down 4.5% today, and I can't figure out why. Anyone have a clue? \n\nI've been losing to AMD 31.5 calls these last few days and need this to get back.", "created_utc": 1568232681, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d2w6r2/calls_for_ttwo_ahead_of_possible_borderlands_3/", "is_self": true}
