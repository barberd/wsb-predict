You need to know there is a HUGE difference between business success and stock success. The valuation of a company has WAY LESS to do with business success than you think. You are right, things will be GREAT for them soon, but not now. \n\nValuations before the virus were at an all time high, companies were using loans that cost a little to make a little more (AT RECORD LEVELS). In fact it\u2019s gotten so bad recently that companies are HAVING to take out riskier and riskier loans just to keep up with the market.\n\nSoooo what does this mean to your brilliant business ventures... \n\nThe same virus that gave the company that opportunity.... Will be the reason it goes down. The general amount of money going into and out of the market is REMARKABLY more important than how good your company does.\n\nPLEASE get out in front and either go cash gang or play options.
