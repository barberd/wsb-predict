{"id": "c6m7pk", "title": "G20 DD", "selftext": "Trump already secured the US a good position, and he won't back down or compromise for less of the current tariff level. What could make Trump and his team pull out?  Strong and vengeful pushbacks from China, perhaps.\n\nBut that kinda pushback has NEVER been the case since the tariff war started (despite what appear to be retaliation tariffs by China ). There was no trade war, and it actually is the beginning of shifting manufacturers from China to Vietnam, India, and the US. This shift is inevitable, as Xi knows.   \nXi and his commie bros condemn protectionism lead by the US, along with reclaiming global trade networks as a bene system.  China cheated the WTO so it's kinda rich now. If the existing global trade networks tilt to the side of bilateral agreements between countries, China will be left as the untrustworthy cheater in the game. That's why they created their own game-The Belt and Road Initiative.   \nThe manufacturing shift is unstoppable, but possible to reduce its speed. China is smart on procrastinating the talks, and Trump has granted them several extensions. But these extensions are far from enough for China to establish their new game. Xi needs more time, not conflicts.   \nNow let us focus on this weekend's Trump-Xi meeting. A trade deal will be made, because:  \n\\- China will not comply literally, just as what they did to WTO and all other shits they promised  \n\\- A trade deal with the US will encourage more countries to join China's Belt and Road game, and it buys China more time to lure more players in  \n\\- US companies in China need to pull out before major confrontations after the shift  \n\\- 2020 is still a possible break for China to have a new opponent (pro-China or not); it's safer to act tough after November 2020( talking tough means no shit)  \n\\- China needs foods from the US, at least before they finish their \"Prussian Potato Reform\"-a term by yours truly  \n\\- Trump needs this for reelection chips to stack up; China will break all promises to make him look petty before the election.  \nSo, that's some basic points on why I loaded up calls and S&amp;P futures today.", "created_utc": 1561738991, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c6m7pk/g20_dd/", "is_self": true}
