The reason being full quarter results having come in and a lot of our clients (tech businesses) have failed to pay or requested negotiation of terms (or have gone bankrupt).\n\nI\u2019ve heard from a lot of my friends that today and this week has been bad for them as well.\n\nHeadlines are coming in about Goldman changing internships, PNC is laying off Corp Dev, etc.\n\nThe stakeholder effect is starting to impact white collar. I still have a job but I\u2019m on the market because I\u2019m worried. I\u2019m not going full bear, but I\u2019m buying spy puts to hedge and I\u2019m not fucking touching Disney or airlines or cruise lines.\n\nTLDR- Long SPY 1 May 20 230 P (spreads fairly tight and cheap)", "created_utc": 1586384514.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxg8ws/q1_results_seems_to_be_bringing_new_layoffs/", "is_self": true}
