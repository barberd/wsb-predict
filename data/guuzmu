It\u2019s ok because that brings down my taxes on capital gains I made this year but I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s any way to get some of it back.\nIs there a strategy I can use to recover some? I also have stocks in this company. Should I roll it out to next option date or just let it expire?\n\nOption expires June 19.\n\nA good lesson was learned \u0ca5_\u0ca5", "created_utc": 1591051806.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/guuzmu/iv_destroyed_my_call_options/", "is_self": true}
