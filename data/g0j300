Paradoxically it is trading only 15% from it\u2019s all time high. Earnings will likely need to lower guidance significantly for 2020. \n\nEarnings are before market open on 4/14/20. \n\nFAST opened at 33.42. **Positions are 32.5p and 30p 4/17/20.**\n\nBackground \u2013 \n\nFastenal sells wholesale and retail industrial and construction supplies. The company services the US, Canada, Puerto Rico, China and the Netherlands. 85% of its sales are in the US. \n\n30% of FAST\u2019s revenue comes from selling threaded fasteners, like bolts, nuts, and screws. The rest of the revenue comes from non-fastener product lines, such as safety supplies and tools which account for 15% and 10% of the supplies. These include items such as janitorial supplies, hydraulics and pneumatics, material handling, cutting tools, and electrical supplies. \n\n**Products made from other companies account for more than 95% of Fastenal\u2019s total sales.** This company is effectively a reseller that makes modifications to their products. They also have on-site vending machines which they believe provides them with a competitive advantage over their peers.\n\nLet\u2019s start with risk factors \u2013 straight from the 10-K - \n\n[FAST 10-K Link](https://s23.q4cdn.com/591718779/files/doc_financials/2019/10-K-SEC-Filing-Excl.-Blank-Pages.pdf)\n\n*\u201cChanges in customer or product mix, downward pressure on sales prices, and changes in volume of orders could cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline in the future. \u201c*\n\n*\u201cOur competitive advantage in our industrial vending business could be eliminated and the loss of key suppliers of equipment and services for that business could be disruptive and could result in failure to deploy devices. \u201c*\n\n*\u201cA downturn in the economy or in the principal markets served by us and other factors may affect customer spending, which could harm our operating results. \u201c- specifically unemployment trends.* \n\n*\u201cProducts manufactured in foreign countries may cease to be available for reasons unrelated to trade policy, which could adversely affect our inventory levels and operating results. \u201c*\n\nThe CoVID-19 pandemic is going to impact sales as there will be less construction to economic contraction. The company is at serious risk to variable and unpredictable supply chain disruptions for their products all around the world due to CoVID-19.\n\nThe stock hit an ATH 02/17/20 at 39.31 just before the CoVID-19 pandemic hit the US. It is currently trading only SIX points lower at 33.62 or at 15% discount despite the fact there is a shut down for likely 2.5 months (mid March through May). Given the uncertainty in supply chain fulfillment as well as pending global recession, it is obvious FAST is going to make a massive hit to their earnings for most of 2020. The extended shut down will also weigh heavily on their near term profitability. \n\nThe pandemic is also causing a unique strain on the construction industry with expected delays due to sickness. Because timelines will be delayed this can expose construction companies to litigation and will further decrease their productivity, all potentially impacting the amount of total construction that will be able to be performed in 2020. The risk of termination of the current contracts for convenience is also high.  \n\nFrom PWC \u2013 *\u201cSome construction projects may be delayed, or perhaps canceled, as a result of the impacts of COVID-19 on the companies and governments that commissioned them. Further, possible supply chain bottlenecks of equipment and materials \u2014 including structural steel and glass from Asia \u2014 could cause project delays in currently funded projects, or reduced spending on future ones.*\n\n*The most immediate impacts are likely to be felt at the subcontractor middle market of the industry, as the specter of potential widespread construction site shutdowns loom in the wake of recent decisions to do so in Massachusetts. Subcontractors may be especially vulnerable to bankruptcy, which could occur after a site shutdown of only weeks.*\n\n*\u2026. We anticipate a sharp rise in the number of organizations invoking \u201ctermination for convenience\u201d clauses for projects in the US and even abroad, as well as force majeure claims by suppliers \u2014 especially those in hard-hit parts of Asia.\u201d*\n\n[Link from pwc](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/library/covid-19/coronavirus-impacts-engineering-construction.html)\n\nThe options on this stock are cheap, with significantly more volume in puts for 4/17 at the 32.5 and 30 strikes. \n\nDue to the significant headwinds to construction industry faced by CoVID-19 including economic contraction, delays in completion of projects, vulnerability of relying on supply chains for 95% of their products FAST is going to miss earnings and have to lower guidance for 2020. Buy 32.5p and 30p 4/17/20.\n\nTLDR : FAST heavily relies on supply chains for their products, there is going to be increased construction delays and reduced construction weighing heavily on their profits.
