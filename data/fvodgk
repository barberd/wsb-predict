{"id": "fvodgk", "title": "The Future of WallStreetBets -- Your Questions Answered", "selftext": "On behalf of u/jartek, u/Arigold212855 and all the mods, we want to acknowledge and give thanks to EVERYONE that has been a part of WSB throughout the years! We are all very grateful and humbled at this amazing community of autists. YOU ARE ALL APPRECIATED. THANK YOU!\n\nWithin the past year there have been a lot of changes within the WSB community and to be honest, we have done a lousy job effectively communicating these changes in a way that is transparent and inclusive of our members. As a result of this, we know that a lot of you are frustrated and unsure of what is taking place and what the future holds for WSB.\n\nWe want to address each major change and issue with transparency and thoroughness:\n___\n\n- **The Creation of the New Discord Server and Stricter Rules Within It.**\n\nA certain level of \u201cchaos\u201d has helped WSB thrive. It\u2019s a huge part of what attracts members and attention and it\u2019s something WE ALL LOVE! The previous Discord server started off with that level of chaos that has made WSB great, but then took a sharp turn towards something else entirely. \n\nFor a long time, we have had reports of frequent and large-scale incidents of racism, acts of hate and pornographic content that appeared to include minors were taking place within that Discord server. There was an effort made to communicate with the mods on that server some of which were mods on the WSB sub, but we were never able to fully confirm what if any actions were being taken to mitigate these things from happening and eventually made the decision to separate and create a new Discord server and implement stricter rules and a zero-tolerance policy for all aforementioned content.\n___\n- **The Release of Jartek\u2019s Book**\n\nThe creation, publishing, and sale of this book was a way to increase awareness of what WSB is, how it got started and what makes it the top financial community online today, by far, as told by the person who created the WHOLE THING! \n\nTHANK YOU TO EVERYONE THAT SUPPORTED THE BOOK!\n___\n- **Creation and Sudden Replacement of the WSB Logo.**\n\nWE LOVED THE OLD LOGO and did not want to change it! We had no choice. While it\u2019s true the individual who claimed to have made this logo for us said we could keep using it this same individual, unfortunately, STOLE IT from someone else\u2019s TED talk presentation many years ago. The more exposure the WSB received the greater chance of cease and desist notices to continue. To not fight what would have been a losing battle and at the advice of our lawyers, we abruptly changed the logo to what it is now. \n\nHere is the \u201csilver lining\u201d: we\u2019ll be allowing ANYONE that wants to contribute to a new logo to do so, as we will be redesigning what\u2019s there. More details soon! (a couple of days). \n___\n- **The WSB Championship Trading Competition and True Trading Group as a sponsor.**\n\nFirst off, we ALL fully acknowledge this was announced terribly, lacking transparency and member inclusion, and we\u2019re about to rectify that. Not because we must, but because WE ALL GIVE A SHIT ABOUT ALL OF YOU!\n\nThis event will be the way WSB publicly kicks down the doors of finance, its communities and shakes it all to its core! This will be the way WSB lets the world know we\u2019re more than a subreddit, we are a fucking financial movement, and this is how we GET SHIT DONE!\n\nThis event will be the first ever E-sports style LIVE trading event where contestants risk their own money at a chance to win a large cash prize that FAR supersedes the money they are risking.\n\nThink \u201cAmerican Ninja Warrior\u201d type announcing with WSB brand of chaos while contestants risk losing it all or making sweet, sweet tendies!\n\nWe are compiling a detailed Q&A list and FULL video that explains the rules of the competition and all other details that we will be launching soon. Once launched, we will do a full AMA for the sub and Discord.\n___\n- **On the topic of True Trading Group as a Sponsor**\n\nHistorically, services like True Trading Group have been BANNED from WSB and for good reasons, that we\u2019re all aware of. \n\n**HOWEVER**\n\nThe owners of TTG reached out to jartek 8 months ago and instead of offering money to him or other mods to shill their version of a \u201cmillionaire-making trading community/service,\u201d they took the approach of asking him if he would take some time and give them his opinion on what they had built. \n\nu/jartek accepted and WARNED them that 10,000 other people have tried to shill garbage on WSB over the years and ALL have failed because all were bullshit and all cared more about making money via burning and churning the selling of a \u201cdream\u201d than actually providing ANY VALUE WHATSOEVER! u/jartek also stated to them that IF he found this to be the same that this would be a costly mistake for TTG as a company and they accepted.\n\nu/jartek\u2019s initial thoughts were cautiously optimistic and as time went by, he saw that not only was this not bullshit but it had real value!\n\nThe conversation of the WSB Championship came up and the idea that was floated around and what eventually was put into action was, TTG has committed to a substantial cash prize and WSB would introduce TTG to its community and ANY AND ALL SALES that came from that, WSB would receive 30% of the GROSS REVENUE and ALL 30% would be used for additional prize money for the event! WSB will make its money from ticket sales and PPV, NOT off of TTG sales!\n\nTrue Trading Group exists to help truly educate traders of all skill levels and types with regard to both stocks and options, to help them learn, trade and profit within a community of pro-traders and others like themselves. \n\nThe content TTG provides is not a \u201cget rich quick gimmick,\u201d it\u2019s legit. There are real lessons that are followed by exams, tons of exclusive video content, real-time DD tools which include filings, free analyst reports and soon, real-time LEVEL 2 via their partnership with QuoteMedia.\n\nRegardless, if you are just getting started with trading or you\u2019re an expert, TTG provides clear and concise education, profitable and transparent trade alerts and support to all members.\n\nu/jartek and I are now in the TTG chatroom daily to help welcome all members of WSB looking for a more educational and focused approach to trading stocks and options. \n\nBottom Line: We have done the research on TTG for 8 months and feel 100% comfortable allowing them to be our sponsor on this event. We hope that the WSB community can give it a fair try and then\u2026 provide real feedback for all. If you sign up for TTG and have a negative opinion you will NEVER be silenced. Comments will not be deleted because of negative opinions and they don\u2019t want that either. What they do want is constructive and real feedback to help add value to their members. \n\n**HOWEVER**\n\nThose who attempt to harm or discredit their business on anything that is not based on facts that can be proven will be BANNED! YOU have something negative to say? COOL say it\u2026 but back it up\u2026 and try and be constructive, this is not a huge ask from us\u2026 \n___\n- **The Future of WSB** \n\nWSB has been everyone\u2019s secret underground finance community where chaos flourishes and high-risk high-reward is the name of the game.\n\nIt is undeniable that the WSB community is growing at a very quick rate. That growth brings about change and we are aware that MOST people, including all of us, HATE CHANGE!\n\nHOWEVER\n\nWe will be transparent including you ALL as we grow and evolve in an effort to not lose touch with the members that have made this community what it is today. Far more important than any monetization effort or \u201cbusiness\u201d is the community of autists that have been here supporting us the whole time!\n\nThere will be no more ideas that are \u201csprung on you last minute or by surprise.\u201d We will include and discuss our growth strategies with you via the sub and Discord. THIS DOES NOT MEAN EVERYONE GETS A VOTE but it DOES MEAN WE WILL CONSIDER ALL FEEDBACK AS WE GROW. \n___\nONE LAST THING:\n\nIn addition to the above issues which we have addressed at length in this thread, there are other \u201cissues\u201d such as conspiracy theories and rumors. What we have to say on this will be kept brief because all of it is asinine and it\u2019s not worth a large response, here you go:\n\n- EVERY SINGLE DETAIL about jartek, his family, anything about MJ Stocks is a fascinating but 100% FICTION. Although we were all impressed and frankly a bit afraid that someone took the time to put so much effort into what is 100% a troll\u2026 but \u201cA\u201d for effort\u2026 lol\n\nGoing Forward On this Topic:\n\n- If you are a part of the WSB community and want to see it move forward in a way that works for everyone, you won\u2019t be spreading FALSE information or doxing ANYONE! Those that do will be banned immediately.\n\n- If you have a question, NO MATTER what the topic about, anything regarding the WSB or those that run it, etc\u2026 PLEASE feel free to ask. YOU will never be banned for asking something straight up.\n___\nIN CLOSING:\n\nWe encourage all of you to now ask us anything and we will respond to as many questions as we can, honestly.", "created_utc": 1586131614.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fvodgk/the_future_of_wallstreetbets_your_questions/", "is_self": true}
