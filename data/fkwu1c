{"id": "fkwu1c", "title": "Jobless Claims", "selftext": " The Jobless Claims (JC) are going to give the market its first look on how bad things will be. The futures and weekend DOW dont matter until 8:30 tomorrow morning.  Last week JC was 211k (better than expected) that saw a DOW decrease of roughly 9%. We have not seen a JC over 300k since 2017. With the GOV talking about sending the $1,000 checks out you can bet your ass everyone filled this out hoping to get their lotto ticket. This week HAS to be higher than expected how does one even price this in? \n\nOnce we see these number that data will be put in to the robo advisors that  will start the sell off. Then with everyone hearing how many people are losing jobs people will pull their money out. This is more or less a confirmation rather than an indicator regardless of what happens. \n\nBulls will say its fake.. Bears will say its truth. Mod or ban.
