{"id": "c8y7yy", "title": "rate cut in July at 100%", "selftext": "I've read that the chances of a 25bp rate cut at the July 31st meeting is 100%.  With nothing really going bad in terms of economic numbers and also a trade war that seems to be on hold, I think it is far-fetched to think Powell is going to cut rates.  Euro/USD cross rate is in a holding pattern.  Gold seems to have hit a little pause too.  Anyone see anything happening between now and July 31st that would encourage the Fed to the rate cut?  Bad UE numbers?  Another trade problem?", "created_utc": 1562214981, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c8y7yy/rate_cut_in_july_at_100/", "is_self": true}
