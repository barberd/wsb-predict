{"id": "fjxf32", "title": "$MAR DD Inside", "selftext": "Hey there autists, felt like you'd like a little inside scoop from someone staying at one of the top Marriott hotels in Houston, TX. It is an absolute ghost town, there are hardly even any employees walking around or working because most have been laid off. They are only keeping 200 of their 1,000 rooms active at the moment, I doubt they've even got 50 rooms in use. All the restaurants and bars are closed downtown. I can't imagine this activity will stop anytime soon. Now imagine the impact this will have on Marriott across the nation.\n\nTL;DR $MAR 60p 4/17", "created_utc": 1584412011.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjxf32/mar_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
