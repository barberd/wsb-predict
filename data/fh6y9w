{"id": "fh6y9w", "title": "Summary of why the world and markets are fucked", "selftext": "So seven months ago /u/cbus20122 posted this brilliant summary of why there is so much systemic risk in the global economy. Now I\u2019m going to repost it here to prevent you guys from losing money and buying calls.\n\nRemember this is a post from seven months ago, read it and buy your fucking puts, we\u2019re going down. \n\n*This time around it seems like geo-political issues will be to blame. Isn\u2019t this all very much preventable?\n\nThat\u2019s the problem. Everyone is thinking this is just trade warz. It\u2019s not. Trade issues don\u2019t help, and they may have tipped things in the opposite direction, but they are not the primary thing causing these problems.\nBut just to inform you...\n\n\u2022 The eurozone sovereign debt crisis of 2011/2012 was never solved. We just got negative interest rates and lots of liquidity injections by the ECB over the past 5 years which kicked the can down the road. Now they\u2019re running out of ammo with almost the entire European bond market yielding negative... which is batshit insane.\n\n\u2022 China\u2019s credit bubble has expanded every year, while their GDP growth has been slowing down. I won\u2019t go far into detail here since it can become its own large thread in itself, but China\u2019s financial problems by themselves could send the world into a major depression in my opinion. I know that\u2019s an extreme comment, I know I\u2019m putting my neck out on a limb saying that, but I don\u2019t see any other way around it if shit hits the fan there. China is directly affected by the trade war issues, but they were seeing financial strain before trade war issues ratcheted up the pressure.\n\n\u2022 Brexit is still a thing, and the \u201cworst case\u201d no deal solutions that was once an afterthought is now becoming accepted as the most likely scenario.\n\n\u2022 US assets are generally very expensive, with software and growth stocks doing their best to mimic dotcom era valuations. Meanwhile, a lot of hot money escaping Europe and Asia\u2019s problems has flowed into the USA, which likely has played a big role in fueling these extraordinary valuations. Even \u201cvalue\u201d stocks have been rather expensive. Multiples have compressed some ever since the height of the 2018 blowoff top, but this is largely just a product of money sloshing into fixed \nincome and safe havens more than anything else.\n\n\u2022 This same flow issue is providing an extraordinary bid for anything providing yield, as foreign pension funds , insurance companies, and banks are starved for yielding assets considering they can\u2019t purchase their own sovereign bonds for positive yield. This has forced foreign financial institutions way out the risk curve, and even with that in mind, they\u2019re still not getting much back in terms of yield. Japanese, Taiwanese, and other foreign institutions are at severe risk if and when credit gets downgraded, or when currency starts to move against them  (which it likely has already started). I can\u2019t state how much of a risk this is systematically.\n\n\u2022 Sure, something like CLO\u2019s by themselves aren\u2019t an enormous issue, but when you realize that CLO\u2019s are just one subset of the \u201canything producing yield\u201d bubble (junk bonds, investment grade debt, em sovereign debt, etc), you start to see the bigger picture. The bond market blowup of Argentina recently is a good example of the risk some institutions may take pushing way out the risk curve in search for a small bit of extra yield. \nThankfully, this wasn\u2019t anything major and it\u2019s not where most money is being placed, but it\u2019s a small example of what can happen here.\n\n\u2022 There is over 12 trillion dollars in emerging market debt denominated in USD, and the dollar just keeps rising. The more we see financial issues in Europe, Asia, etc, the more this just squeezes the US dollar higher, putting even more strain on the global financial system since it gets even more difficult to repay these USD-denominated debts. This is especially negative for all EM countries, and I\u2019m not really sure what the long term solution is. There have been attempts to kick the can down the road, but most of those just involved more borrowing, which just made the problem worse in the long run.\n\nSo to summarize, we have systematic risk in China, Europe, and broader Asia, and then on to of that, we have highly stretched valuations in the USA. It all goes hand in hand, but trade wars may be the hammer that breaks this stretched system apart. FWIW, there is a LOT of nuance, a lot of other issues, and there are also some positives I\u2019m not adding here since it\u2019s not the point. But the main point worth making is that people should pull their heads out of their ass and quit paying attention to all the trade war garbage. It\u2019s an issue, but it\u2019s likely more the needle than the actual problem itself.*\n\nSo in the end coronavirus started the reckoning, buy puts. I suggest on EM indexes and banks. Also will be a matter of time before tech valuations start to dril imo.", "created_utc": 1583970687.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fh6y9w/summary_of_why_the_world_and_markets_are_fucked/", "is_self": true}
