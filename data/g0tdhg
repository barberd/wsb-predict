{"id": "g0tdhg", "title": "Why we won't see major drops anymore", "selftext": "Has anyone spent the time to what the S&P500 is actually constituted of as of today.\n\nFirst of all, we all know mass un-employment is occurring and people working in local restaurants and all are screwed. But, just because the rest of the world is in ruins doesn't mean every sector is in shambles.\n\nYou see, unlike past recessions, in this current epidemic, one sector is gloriously going to profit out of the recession. And we all know what that sector is: **the technology sector**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHave you nerds checked what S&P500 has turned to in its market cap recently.\n\n**Boomers in Wall Street finally caught on. Your S&P500 is now a tech and health care index. Other sectors don't matter anymore in our economy.**\n\nBoomers finally accepted 'future is tech and health care' from all these airline companies and all.\n\nLet's look at SPY major holdings:\n\n    Software \t8.37%\n    IT Services \t5.57%\n    Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals \t5.16%\n    Pharmaceuticals \t5.08%\n    Interactive Media & Services \t5.04%\n    Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment \t4.42%\n    Banks \t4.37%\n    Internet & Direct Marketing Retail \t4.08%\n    Health Care Equipment & Supplies \t3.74%\n    Equity Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) \t3.11%\n\nSo summed up:\n\nTechnology (Software/IT Services/ Technoloy Hardware/Interactive Media/ Semiconductor/Internet) is: `8.37 + 5.57 + 5.16 + 4.42 + 4.08 = 27.6%`\n\nAnd for Health Care (Pharmaceuticals / Health Care Equipment): `5.08 + 3.74 = 8.82%`\n\nOver 36.4% of SPY is technology and health care currently.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll this cry about real estate, hotels, restaurants, airlines collapsing:\n\n    Real Estate: 3.11%\n    Hotels and Restaurants: 1.55%\n    Airlines: 0.2%\n\nEven IF every single real estate, hotel, restaurant, airline company went bankrupt in the S&P500, it's only 4.86% of SPY. Big boomer money on Wall Street must have finally noticed this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSPY calls 300 end of this year.\n\nBy end of this epidemic, we might have almost half of SPY be technology and health care.\n\nImagine being a gay bear competing against infinite QE from FED with all this information.
