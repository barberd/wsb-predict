I\u2019ve averaged down on the dips, but I\u2019m still looking at about a $6k loss right now. \n\nIf I sell GOOG for a $6k loss and immediately replace it with GOOGL, will that be considered a wash sale? Or would I get to account for the $6k loss while simultaneously getting to keep essentially the same position open?", "created_utc": 1560170630, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/byxe74/sell_goog_to_buy_googl_wash_sale/", "is_self": true}
