{"id": "db2bco", "title": "Oil set for a big week?", "selftext": "With rising tensions between Houthis/Iran and Saudi Arabia oil prices should see a spike this week. However, I\u2019m concerned that because American media outlets aren\u2019t reporting as they should on this I could be wrong. Here are some things that should be a big deal but haven\u2019t been in the mainstream news.\n\nHouthis have reported defeated/captured 20% of Saudi Arabia\u2019s brigades. (Pending confirmation, but BBC and Washington Post are the only outlets that have reported this and is almost non existent on main stream news.)\n\nSaudi Arabia warns Iran  \u201cpatience is not limitless and is running out\u201d.\n\nIran states it is ready and prepared for an imminent physical/cyber attack on its oil infrastructure.\n\nWhen you add in the news that has been widely reported oil should be set for a big week. What do you guys think?\n\nTl;DR for the Autist out there: Buy $USO Calls.", "created_utc": 1569796197, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/db2bco/oil_set_for_a_big_week/", "is_self": true}
