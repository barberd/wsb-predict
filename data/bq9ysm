One of the best countries to invest in stocks is the USA, I have a solid background in value invest but I have some questions to ask you if you permit: \n\n1) Currently our exchange rate is USDBRL = 4,1. It's is pretty high right now, the reason is some economic policies applied by the USA and the uncertainty of our national market. Is it a good time to invest in this stocks based in the logic that I will buy less stocks because of the high exchange rate?\n\n2) Will I see some problem creating a account in a american stock brokerage based in the fact that I'm from another country? Just pointing, there's no prohibition in my country to do that!", "created_utc": 1558220320, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bq9ysm/should_i_invest_in_the_american_stocks_market/", "is_self": true}
