They have fucked me out of thousands of dollars the last few months by doing this. Case in point EA 88p last Friday. They were sold off for 5 dollars a piece at 3pm losing me a couple hundred. The way the market was trending I had every intention of holding them until 3:55. Suffice it to say they became itm and were worth over 60 a piece. And don't say get a real broker because I have 3. I just prefer to do my gambling with RH for ease of use.", "created_utc": 1563647680, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cfp5x6/robinhood_automatically_selling_expiring_options/", "is_self": true}
