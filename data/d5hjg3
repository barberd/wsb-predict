{"id": "d5hjg3", "title": "Keep your eyes open for companies that get back into the CRT monitor business", "selftext": "For a long time now, there's been a sort of underground appreciation in certain segments of the gaming scene for CRT monitors. People appreciate their refresh rate, responsiveness and smooth motion in particular. You can find dedicated sub-Reddits like /r/crtgaming and websites dedicated to getting the cleanest RGB signals through old monitors like retrorgb.com.\n\nWell, yesterday Digital Foundary, a major tech-focused gaming outlet, [posted a glowing review of a 15 year old monitor and claimed unquestionably that they were better than 4k monitors and LCD in general](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8BVTHxc4LM). \n\nEnthusiasts have been buying up old stock for years, while the majority of people have been scrapping CRTs at an alarming rate. As this goes more and more mainstream, the dwindling available supply and increased public interest will almost certainly result in some company getting *back* into the CRT business in some capacity. That company will probably do pretty brisk business for a while as it will take some time to redevelop the tech and get enough product out there to fulfill demand.\n\nAnyway, something to watch out for. Be ready to get out before the short-lived demand is met. The current mechanical keyboard market is a good analog (no pun intended) to see how this thing might go in the future.
