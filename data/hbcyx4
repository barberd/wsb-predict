Its at its 52 week low with earnings coming up in AUGUST, and it seemed to hit all but 1 of their EPS with 1 being rock bottom. The EPS is also all the same which is suspicious af.\n\nIts also a chinese stock and could end up being an fruadulent  like GSX. Which is my biggest fear.\n\nBut China LOVES mobile gaming, and during lockdowns they would have nothing else to do.\n\nIf I buy in at its absolute low and hope it goes up by earnings next month when China should have pumped it by being in lockdown and on their phones all day but I am unsure because my plays don't always work and I managed to bungle \"sure things\" before.\n\nThoughts on a month long call on the expectation that the lock downs in China moon this thing?", "created_utc": 1592480268.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hbcyx4/momo_worth_it_for_a_chinese_lock_down_play/", "is_self": true}
