Im speaking for New York, but I\u2019m sure other states are suffering too. \n\nIve been trying to get a specialist on the phone for the past week with no avail. \n\nNew York has added extra people to work for the unemployment office. They extended hours and days of operation. \n\nBut if you call from dusk till dawn chances of your call getting through are slim.\n\nAnd a lot of people are having the same problems.\n\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/nypost.com/2020/03/27/workers-laid-off-due-to-coronavirus-cant-get-through-to-unemployment-office/amp/\n\nNow what does that mean. It means we are lagging WAY behind the actual numbers. \n\nUntil we see more open phone lines, unemployment numbers are going to keep sky rocketing. \n\nWith that being said Im guessing markets are going up 20% because of this.\n\nTLDR: Unemployment numbers are way under exaggerated. So buy calls because nothing makes sense.\n\nPositions.
