This is for 4/9-4/13. I\u2019m your host and resident autist u/expander2. You have to be able to read to gain anything from this so that rules out about half of you. As always, this is organized from most important at the top to least important at the bottom. A TLDR, plays, and previous DD summaries will be at the bottom. My last posts still stand and hold some good info so check it out for more plays if this isn't enough for you greedy fucks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDISCLAIMER; I am not personally advocating for any play that I add to this list. I merely go through a couple of days of posts and find what I think is competent DD. PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry for not having anything to post on Friday. You assholes didn't make any good DD until the weekend so I will compile everything decent into this big post. Now lets jump right into plays and get into the rest of the bullshit later.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nW. P. Carey Inc. (WPC), Solar Capital Ltd (SLRC), and Westlake Chemical Partners (WLKP) all had large jumps in executives buying shares in their own companies. Look into [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fym3ob/recap_of_last_weeks_unusual_insider_purchasing/) to get more background info on each of these companies but I read it for you so I know stuff too. There are a few reasons that executives will buy stock in their own companies;\n\n1. They have to because it is stipulated in their contracts that they have to own a certain amount of their company.\n2. They think that their price is discounted and are trying to juke out the SEC.\n3. They think they are going to shoot up in price soon and are trying to juke out the SEC.\n\nThese guys are combining 2 and 3. Only two of these companies have pre-arranged share plans for executives and even with them, they are buying much more than necessary. Sure this could possibly be insider trading but who gives a fuck if we can profit from it too? Look into them. Follow the news and add them to your watchlists. If you start seeing a good rise then buy some calls or some shares. Might as well, what else is there to lose?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOil is a hot topic right now. OPEC and all the shit that went down with Mexico walking out then they all got together and sang kumbaya. They [cut production of oil](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/12/opec-and-allies-finalize-record-oil-production-cut-after-days-of-discussion.html) by nearly 10% coming to about 9.7 million barrels a day. [This post goes into detail](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fzd5cx/boats_and_oil_hoes_how_you_can_play_the_contango/) about what this means for oil and how to play it. He discusses futures (not enough to teach you about them), what is going to happen because of this deal, and what to do with this information. I can sum that up for you in a couple of sentences here. Oil is cheap, companies want to store it. Therefore, companies that can store it are going to get paid to do so. These companies that can store a shit load of oil are DHT Holdings (DHT), Euronav (EURN), International Seaways (INSW) and Frontline (FRO). The companies that can hold a bunch of oil (less than a shit load) are Nordic American Tankers (NAT), Teekay Tankers (TNK) and Diamond S Shipping (DSSI). Calls in whichever of these you can for after August this year. You can always offload before this but these are the best bet for the highest profit and are what the OP of the post recommends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJohnson and Johnson (JNJ) releases earnings on Tuesday (4/14). They have reported no significant shortages in Pharma or MedTech. They are even seeing increased consumer demand and in some areas an increase of two to four times is seen. Because today has been red for them, it is a good time to get some calls for the end of the week or mid next month. For more info check out [this right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0ao80/johnson_and_johnson_earnings_play/). \n\n \n\nIf you want a reason to hold your Disney (DIS) puts [read this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fzc8e6/dis_puts/). Personally, I don't fuck with the rat so I'm not gonna do a write up here. He says they are overvalued, I say too big to fail. Good luck either way. \n\n \n\nNow, [this is a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fzhs4d/when_will_we_bottom_out/) that is all about timing the market and calling the inflection points of changes. For the sake of you lazy asshole here is a quote from this fantastic post by u/aibnsamin1;\n\n\u201cTherefore, our timeline looks like:\n\n* 11/14/20 - yearly low (selected from histogram averages, 11/15/20, and the 8.6 Year Confidence model)\n* 7/28/21 - End of bear market (18 month average of 8/9, averaged with histogram date of 7/15)\n* 4/14/22 - lesser correction.\u201d\n\nAnother quote;\n\n* Markets rise slower than they correct, however they rise much more than they fall. In the same vein, instruments can only fall to having no worth, whereas they could theoretically grow infinitely and have continued to grow over time.\n\nFor new investors and the majority of you retards, this is a revelation. It's like God himself whispered in your ear and explained what the market is. Thanks God! Read the post. It is a very good technical analysis and uses a lot of numbers that you won't understand to predict where the market will go. Before you say it, yes the market is predictable. But it's a lot of work and very hard to do it right. This isn't like the guy in the stupid idiot section later that just guesses the top of our rise, this is real shit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBig Stupid Idiot of the Day is [this guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fy5b8t/a_prophet_arrives/). DOW 24,281.16 is what he says the top of this rise is. For right now this retard is going on the stupid idiot of the day list. If he\u2019s right then he is a new God amongst men. If he\u2019s wrong\u2026 well most of us are so whatever. He still would have to be banned. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck fuckers and tune in on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for more WSB DD Summaries!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; WPC, SLRC, and WLKP are maybe trading inside so profit from it, oil is going to be big price, JNJ make money from corona, DIS impossible to call, 11/14/20 - yearly low, 7/28/21 - End of bear market,  DOW 24,281.16 is top I guess. \n\nPlays; Calls for WPC, SLRC, and WLKP a couple of months out. Calls in DHT, EURN, INSW, FRO, NAT, TNK, and DSSI for at least August. JNJ calls for 4/17 or for mid-May. DIS puts (probably not, don't fuck with the rat).\n\nPrevious WSB DD Summaries;[ ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fq231l/wsb_dd_summary_326327_plays_and_tldr_included/)[3/28-3/30](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fruu30/i_compiled_dd_from_the_last_few_days_for_you/),[ 4/3-4/6](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fw4nmv/wsb_dd_summary_4346_i_hope_you_fucks_can_read/), [4/7-4/8](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxtpbi/summary_of_dd_from_4748_plays_and_tldr_included/)\n\nEdit; WPC, SLRC, and WLKP are not going to get caught for insider trading.
