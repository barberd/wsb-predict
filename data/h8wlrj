{"id": "h8wlrj", "title": "Possibilities for airlines this week? (AAL, DAL or UAL)", "selftext": "I have read multiple reports, news articles, and opinion pieces on how the airlines are apparently doing better lately and having more bookings. Most are speaking specifically about American bouncing back up this week, but I wonder if Delta or United would be a better investment.\n\n  \nUAL sits at 39.43, DAL at 30.30, and AAL at 16.68. American has been the one fluctuating the most, and it has the biggest volume of all. It's the most volatile of all and, thus, presents a better opportunity for a quick buy and sell.\n\n  \nWhat do you guys make of this? Anyone else betting on airlines this week? Which one?", "created_utc": 1592151164.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h8wlrj/possibilities_for_airlines_this_week_aal_dal_or/", "is_self": true}
