{"id": "eodce4", "title": "$NFLX Jun '18 $423 peak vs. $TSLA today", "selftext": "Here's an analysis of $TSLA currently vs. $NFLX when it peaked in June 2018 at $423. Below are the 21 greatest daily gains during each stocks bull market run from bottom to top. \n\nThese are called \"climactic tops\" - when euphoria sets in after a good run in a stock, the stock begins to trade on greater volume (highlighted in red text), gap up often, and experience significant daily gains (highlighted orange). Significant gains towards the end of a run are not healthy and indicate speculation. Healthy bull runs experience the biggest gains at the beginning and the gains should remain stable or fade over time, not increase.\n\n[TSLA today vs. NFLX peak Jun'18](https://preview.redd.it/d5xba8dyyma41.png?width=2219&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6be2aecb91bd19f3e93df715bc71cc52163cb18d)\n\nI learned this [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0APWyNU_lbo). If tomorrow TSLA gaps up (currently +1% after hours), reaches a new intraday high (if it gaps up it will given that it closed at ATH), and then closes the day down (wait until the final 10 mins of trading to confirm) you can expect the top to likely be in. This is exactly what happened to NFLX. I will be shorting TSLA on whenever the next down day is - gap up, gap down, whatever idgaf as long as it has a red daily candle - with a SL just above the intraday ATH. \n\nIn terms of downside targets? After it's peak, NFLX steadly declined about 22.9% within 2 months, and 40% within 6 months  (although this was Q4 2018 so may not be a reliable). It's reasonable to expect we could see a similar \\~23% drop in TSLA too over a similar timeframe atleast. However TSLA has had a far more aggressive climax than NFLX, and is far more volatile/sentiment based, as such I believe that a 30% decline is likely, and in a shorter timeframe, after that perhaps even a 40%-50% overall decline, peak to trough.   \n\nOptions are expensive for $TSLA. $520 March Puts are $45 bucks so your breakeven would be $475 (-9%). Results for long these puts: 25% decline ($375) returns 180%, a 40% decline returns 362%. Perhaps you could sell calls? I'll leave option strategy to you it's not my area.\n\nHope you found this useful. I'll return at the end of this week and see how it played out.", "created_utc": 1578962379, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eodce4/nflx_jun_18_423_peak_vs_tsla_today/", "is_self": true}
