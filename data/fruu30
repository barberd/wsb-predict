{"id": "fruu30", "title": "I compiled DD from the last few days for you tards, TLDR and plays included", "selftext": "Welcome back to the WSB DD Summary! This is for 3/26-3/27. I\u2019m your host and resident autist u/expander2. You have to be able to read to gain anything from this so that rules out about half of you. As always, this is organized from most important at the top to least important at the bottom. A TLDR, plays, and previous DD summaries will be at the bottom. My last posts still stand and hold some good info so check it out for more plays if this isn't enough for you greedy fucks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDISCLAIMER; I am not personally advocating for any play that I add to this list. I merely go through a couple of days of posts and find what I think is competent DD. PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe are gonna start with some market anticipation today. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqjeda/what_the_hell_isnt_priced_in/) goes through what has been priced in and what hasn't. With all of us losing money and everyone screaming, \u201cMArKet ONLy gO Up eVEn whEN NeWS bAD?\u201d someone had to explain what is priced in and what's not. So here's what is priced in already; Unemployment, 2-month shutdown, more cases, more deaths. WHAT IS NOT PRICED IN; Corporate, Municipal, and State bankruptcies, credit defaulting (student, auto, and home loans), a longer than expected shutdown, higher than anticipated new cases and deaths. These things can cause problems for the market while the stuff we know about is not gonna cause a big shift. Watch the news, read the posts, blag blah blah you already know.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo going off of that, [these charts and shit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqdy37/covid19_bestworse_case_scenarios_us/) show where we can be, where we are now, and where we could have been in relation to the Beer Flu. It's not looking too hot for us but what do you do? Cases are gonna go up a lot, deaths are gonna go up a lot. Maybe not as high as in that post but who knows. Don't roll over and take the market crumbling like a bitch. Make money from the fall and keep your pants on. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, on to some plays. Owens and Minors (OMI) is [anticipated to make some good money](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fr3jk0/owens_and_minors_medical_ppe_working_with_the_us/) off of this pandemic. They are working closely with FEMA, the white house team, and HHS. It beat EPS in the last 3 quarters. Most medical manufacturing companies are gonna do good in this market but this company is partnered with the government and put everything in place BEFORE the outbreak took hold everywhere else so they could be ready for it. Overall a good choice. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nChewy (CHWY) is also [poised to make a good increase](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frfoyd/chwy_earnings_play_april_2nd/) in price given how far they dropped because of the crash. They are hiring over 6000 new workers, they are backed up on deliveries because of the increase in sales and strain on the shipping industry, earnings will be released April 2nd and they are expected to be high. If you aren't confident in making this play yourself, just watch and see what happens. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs we all know at this point, [Germany's minister of state finance took his own life](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fr8u20/death_of_german_state_finance_minister_official/). F in the chat for him but we can take some info away from this. If this guy committed suicide because of everything that's going on then we are looking at some bad shit in the coming weeks form Europe. Expect a drop but don't buy anything close. This market is too unpredictable to do anything close to expiry so be careful. Watch EWG but it sticks pretty close to SPY so it's not a perfect indicator of Germany's economy. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nKnowledge of the day is [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqpbnb/stop_buying_expensive_options_on_obvious_plays/) explaining how to pick a play in this new market. OP tells us to watch for the volatility already being priced into the option price. With obvious moves, the IV will already be priced in so you're looking at smaller returns. Read the post for more info as it will probably help a lot of you out.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBig Stupid Idiot of the Day is anyone that thinks that [this isnt the truth](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frfhlt/a_brief_explanation_of_options_for_stoolies/). We layout all this info for you here and you ungrateful fucks disregard it completely. Christ you people make me angry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck fuckers and tune in on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for more WSB DD Summaries!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Buy the dip, faggot.\" -Warren Buffett\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Know and understand what is priced in and what is not, cases and deaths will go up and it depends on how high they go if it will be priced in or not, Owens and Minors looks to be going up, Chewy looks to be going up, Germany and the other European countries could go down but watch how close they follow SPY. \n\nPlays; Calls on OMI and CHWY, Puts on EWG (maybe). Overall, just brainstorm what will go down if the economy goes under. There are no 100% perfectly anticipated trades. Be safe but scared money don't make money.\n\nPrevious WSB DD Summaries; [3/21-3/23](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fnui1i/i_compiled_dd_from_the_last_3_days_for_you_cucks/),[ 3/24-3/25](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fp0s8l/wsb_dd_summary_324325_plays_and_tldr_included/), [3-26-3-27](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fq231l/wsb_dd_summary_326327_plays_and_tldr_included/)", "created_utc": 1585588468.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fruu30/i_compiled_dd_from_the_last_few_days_for_you/", "is_self": true}
