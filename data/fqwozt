{"id": "fqwozt", "title": "Florida DD: No one cares about beer virus", "selftext": "Today I left my house to see how many places were actually open and how many people were actually out in the streets at these businesses. To my surprise (or rather not) no one gives a fuck!! I drove from plaza to plaza for about 10 miles and 90% of people are out in the streets socializing, most without masks and few with gloves. I actually went into a few places and the hand sanitizer dispensers were either out of hand soap, or broken. There is a huge population of elderly in Florida and most are unprotected and just using their hands when they sneeze in public. Traffic wasn\u2019t even affected. Truck drivers are pretty common over here and most are just getting by with some gloves. I can\u2019t speak for the whole state because I only drove for about 10 miles, but most people don\u2019t really give a fuck and the government isn\u2019t really doing much except telling people to stay inside, but no one cares. I also think it\u2019s fair to say that with the \u201cFlorida man\u201d memes coming from the news, our state is pretty much fucked.", "created_utc": 1585443616.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqwozt/florida_dd_no_one_cares_about_beer_virus/", "is_self": true}
