{"id": "bui9np", "title": "My take on the WDAY earnings", "selftext": "Just kidding. Its more BYND due diligence from today. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nS3 Trading put out a report on short interest for BYND. Short Interest on the 15th of May was 39% of float and NOW stands at 51% of the float. When I call around I get borrow rates between 55-87%, but apparently S3 is reporting that new shorts are being charged 80-100%. All the more ammunition for the squeeze. This was my initial thesis and the reason why I think this is the next Tilray. Forget about fundamentals for the moment. This is a highly shorted fad stock in a \"hot\" sector with an insanely low float. THOSE are the fundamentals that matter to me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso- in Germany, the grocery store Lidl started offering a trial of Beyond Meat and they sold out in the first day. \n\n[https://www.merkur.de/leben/genuss/aerger-ueber-lidl-kunden-reissen-sich-beyond-burger-discounter-patzt-12289564.html](https://www.merkur.de/leben/genuss/aerger-ueber-lidl-kunden-reissen-sich-beyond-burger-discounter-patzt-12289564.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSteve Easterbrook, CEO of McDonalds said they are weighing adding a non-meat burger to their menu but have to weigh the added complexity to the menu. Sounds reasonable. No mention of testing BYND as of yet. They are testing Nestle Veggie burgers in Germany but other markets get to pick their own suppliers. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCNBC said they are having another interview with Easterbrook this afternoon so I will update this post if he mentions BYND.", "created_utc": 1559154350, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bui9np/my_take_on_the_wday_earnings/", "is_self": true}
