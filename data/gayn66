{"id": "gayn66", "title": "The Bears' Last Stand", "selftext": "There is a fierce battle going on right now. The Invisible Enemy is only a side-piece in this battle. Most of you have felt it, but do not see the battle lines drawn out. The SPY bears are making their last stand. At the other end are the charging bulls, buoyed by a fresh wave of green by the Feds' mighty printer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe first line of defense, the moat at SPY 293, has been assaulted heavily. SPY 293 is the 61.8 Fibonacci retrace. I read an [Investopedia article on Fibonacci ratios](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/fibonacciretracement.asp), so I am an expert on this just like the rest of you. This 61.8 Fibonacci number is simply a magic number which works in the same way magic does: it's plucked from the air and doesn't always work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe second line of defense is the castle walls at SPY 297. This is where the heaviest combat will be. If the bulls are able to storm through this and successfully take the castle of SPY 300, they will have an open path to SPY 310. From there, the bulls will be able to spy the peaks of SPY's ATH. That is not to say that SPY will reach ATH anytime soon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe fundamentals would hardly matter. Never mind the unemployment numbers, the rising death count and cases or even that this could be the deepest recession since the Great Depression.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe bulls will continue their headlong charge until they wear themselves out or when the bears finally give up. Till then, we will continue to see SPY trading in this channel between 280 and 297, perhaps even until next week. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDisclaimer: This is purely technical analysis, making it all speculative.", "created_utc": 1588263158.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gayn66/the_bears_last_stand/", "is_self": true}
