{"id": "e1u6x9", "title": "$UNIT", "selftext": "Alright you paint huffers, try to get through this. It\u2019s a good story. I\u2019ve been watching $UNIT for half a year now since someone else posted a trade about it. I\u2019ve continually bought into this stock as it goes lower and lower and lower and I think that, after my countless attempts to catch a falling knife, it\u2019s finally bottomed out.\n\nUniti group is a REIT that constructs and acquires communications infrastructure through fiber, towers and leasing. They are a spin-off of Windstream Holdings. \n\nIn order to understand what\u2019s going on I have to start with who Windstream is. Windstream [is a provider of voice and data network communications](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windstream_Holdings) in predominantly rural areas. Windstream was and is a growing and profitable business. In 2015, Windstream decided to create a spin-off REIT in a move that would allow them to [reduce more than $4 billion in debt and increase network investments](https://investor.uniti.com/news-releases/news-release-details/windstream-board-directors-gives-final-approval-reit-spinoff-and). This was a pretty good move on their part as it freed up capital to continue making network investments and gave Windstream share holders a quarterly .25 cent dividend. It also allowed Uniti (then CS&amp;L) to operate as an independent company. This was also good for the newly formed Uniti as some of the sale-leasebacks [have almost 100% margins](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.fool.com/amp/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/05/09/uniti-group-inc-unit-q1-2019-earnings-call-transcr.aspx). This is all good and well for except for two things: One, Uniti\u2019s income now was 100% dependent on Windstream until they diversified and two, this spin-off [tripped bond indentures](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.barrons.com/amp/articles/windstream-loses-legal-case-against-hedge-fund-aurelius-and-now-is-stuck-with-a-huge-bill-51550318739) meaning Windstream was now in default of issued bonds. This wasn\u2019t an issue with most bond holders as they would be happy getting paid out when the bonds matured. Enter Aurelius Capital Management.\n\nAurelius Capital Management is a hedge fund operated by Mark Brodsky, a former bankruptcy lawyer. This is a ruthless man who is driven solely by profit and money and I\u2019ll be goddamned if that\u2019s not the way God intended things to be. This is the same man who [attempted to force the government of Argentina to pay 1.3 Billion following the 2010 Argentinian default on debt.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2019-01-14/aurelius-capital-sues-argentina-over-gdp-linked-securities). They\u2019re vultures, gotta respect the hustle. Anyway, in 2017, a couple years after the Windstream/Unit spin-off, Aurelius buys up 25% of Windstream\u2019s 2023 Bonds, then hits up the local CDS (Credit Default Swap, yes like The Big Short) market and gets a handful of those. The CDS will pay out if Windstream ever misses a payment on its debt. Then they walk back over to Windstream and say hey, your spin-off of assets violated bond covenants and we want to accelerate the payments of these notes. You owe us full repayment plus interest, approximately 310 Million. Windstream, being the reasonable company they are, say hey we can\u2019t pay that, we don\u2019t have the capital for that, that will bankrupt us. Plus, we didn\u2019t violate bond covenants. Windstream is pretty confident that they didn\u2019t violate bond covenants but just in case, they issue more notes in order to dilute Aurelius\u2019s bond holdings down to 6.25% of the 2023\u2019s, they try and retroactively get waivers from other bond holders and they visit **TWO** different law firms, both which say, Nah, you\u2019re good bruh. You didn\u2019t violate bond covenants. Subsequently, the stock price that had fallen to $2 per share rises to $7 per share over the course of the next few months. The Aurelius lawsuit was within the market's Personal Risk Tolerance. \n\nOn February 25th, 2019, Judge Jesse Furman of the Federal District Court in Manhattan rules that Windstream did, in fact, violate bond covenants when it spun off its fiber-optic cable business into Uniti. This caught everyone by surprise except Bid Dick Aurelius who is now awarded 310.5 Million and *will get paid out by the CDS it had*. What happened next is pretty brutal. Windstream immediately filed for a chapter 11 bankruptcy, watched its stock become a penny stock and has top executives [claiming market manipulation](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.barrons.com/amp/articles/windstream-files-for-bankruptcy-calls-for-credit-default-swap-regulation-51551133206). To which Aurelius responds, and I quote, \u201cWindstream\u2019s accusation of market manipulation is nonsense,\u201d says an Aurelius spokesperson. \u201cRather than whining about us and Judge Furman, Windstream\u2019s management and board should engage in much-needed introspection.\u201d Basically, suck it up pussies.\n\nYou\u2019re probably wondering how this relates to Unit by now. Well, remember when I told you that Uniti\u2019s revenue was 100% dependent on Windstream until they diversified? Well, they didn\u2019t diversify quick enough. Windstream still accounts for 64% of Uniti\u2019s revenue, which means when the ruling went against Windstream, Uniti\u2019s stock price went down with it. To make matters worse, Windstream is looking to recharacterize a $650 million-per-year lease agreement with spinoff REIT Uniti Group Inc. as a disguised financing arrangement that siphoned hundreds of millions of dollars away from them. They\u2019re saying that the lease was never actually a lease but a financing deal. They\u2019re trying to claw back millions in payments in order to free up cash flow and get billions back in assets which are no longer theirs. This claim is artificially holding down Uniti\u2019s stock price, as a ruling for Windstream could mean Uniti loses $650 million per year in the lease revenue. Here\u2019s where we finally get to the trade. I believe that Uniti and Windstream will never even get to the court date that\u2019s planned in March of 2020. Today, November 25th, a [summary of judgement](http://www.kccllc.net/windstream/document/1922312191125000000000010) was entered along with the supporting [memorandum of law](http://www.kccllc.net/windstream/document/1922312191125000000000011). This essentially holds Uniti\u2019s lawyers\u2019 arguments about dismissing Windstream\u2019s ridiculous attempt to recharacterize the lease as financing. It has compelling arguments and since I know you won\u2019t read it, I\u2019ll try and summarize the strongest argument.\n\nIn order for Windstream to spin Unit into a REIT and gain the tax-advantage status while also maximizing both companies values, they had to ensure that the lease was a \u201ctrue lease.\u201d Windstream structured it like that. They also pitched it like that when selling Uniti securities to creditors and investors that traded Windstream debt and equity for Uniti\u2019s. Windstream further claims that Windstream\u2019s structural peculiarities somehow render the lease an unsecured and structurally subordinated financing. This would be news to Uniti\u2019s investors, who purchased Uniti securities based on Windstream\u2019s representations that Uniti owned that property and received rent payments from Windstream under a true lease.\n\nBasically they would\u2019ve intentionally misled potential creditors and investors. As a result I believe that on or around December 18th, 2019, Honorable Robert D. Drain will grant summary judgement in favor of Uniti, dismissing all claims of recharacterization the Master Lease as financing. This will remove all uncertainty from Uniti, will require that Windstream assume the Master lease unchanged and will also result in $UNIT trading at or around $20 by January 20th, 2020. \n\nTherefore, I suggest you get 5/15 - $10 Calls. They\u2019re fairly cheap.\n\n\nTL;DR: 5/15/20 $UNIT Calls", "created_utc": 1574750786, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e1u6x9/unit/", "is_self": true}
