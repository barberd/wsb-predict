This is false. SPCE is only the beginning. It showed us what our combined autism could get us if we just work together. A single autist could not have done what we did to spce. That being said, it may be time we let spce dry out and hop train and bull our way through another stock and make even more profit. Discuss among yourselves what stock this should be, but I\u2019m thinking PLUG. \n\nIt\u2019s dirt cheap, and has the potential to be the next spce if we all us retards buy in and charge the front lines once again. \n\nI\u2019ve heard people say stonks only go up. This is true as long as the autistic people on wsb are invested in said stonk.\n\nGod speed autists, god speed.", "created_utc": 1582058849, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f5ygvm/this_is_only_the_beginning/", "is_self": true}
