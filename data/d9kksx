{"id": "d9kksx", "title": "Easy, medium, and hard to trade", "selftext": "I put this in the daily thread yesterday and thought I would put it here since some might find it helpful. \n\nThe idea is to identify *very clear* upward or downward (I'll focus on upward) **channels**: \n\n**EASY (ish) to trade looks like this:**\n\nMSFT. Had a massive uptrend channel. Now established a new one (call it a lane change): [https://www.tradingview.com/x/sNt18Gx2/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/sNt18Gx2/)\n\nMCD [https://www.tradingview.com/x/reUKXO42/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/reUKXO42/)This lane change channel (new lower one) might be a bear flag, however. I am now no longer trading MCD until it becomes clear again. \n\n AMD [https://www.tradingview.com/x/QzKgXWKe/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/QzKgXWKe/) It broke it's channel. Now looks like a big descending triangle. It may make another descending triangle, unless ER is insanely good, like this: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/Xbut0RXa/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Xbut0RXa/)AMD is now tricky to trade. I have stayed away from it since it broke the channel.\n\nTEAM: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/F0e1b4OO/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/F0e1b4OO/) Now looking bad. Time to stay away. \n\nV: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/dIJ5Cui3/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/dIJ5Cui3/) But now it's time to stay away for a while.\n\nFB: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/BWiTslRh/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/BWiTslRh/)  It was easy as hell to trade FB from 2013 to March 2018. So five year run, with a lane change upward (so instead of getting fucked after 5 years, you doubled your money). And then it's been chaos since. \n\n**Medium:** \n\nExhibit 4: TSLA: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/eANDy6jT/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/eANDy6jT/) Looks like it might be a new uptrend channel. Buying calls at the bottom this morning would have been great risk to reward.\n\nExhibit 5: AAPL. [https://www.tradingview.com/x/4id10tio/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/4id10tio/)AAPL likes STEEP upward channels and downshifting lanes frequently. I have 225calls.   AAPL establishes channels but doesn't hold them for very long. Very news dependent. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Hard as fuck:   (These stocks make what I might call a 'crown' pattern. There's some bottom line and just spikes. Looks like there's multiple levels of support above bottom line but you never know what will hold and when it will bounce.** \n\nMDB: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/A1eXt31A/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/A1eXt31A/)How can you predict anything on this thing? You can try to play support bounces, but no one ever knows if supports will hold and provide a bounce for your calls.\n\nDIS: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/MeIi7XYI/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/MeIi7XYI/) Same thing. No trend. Sideways. Looks like it has bounced five times off of 131. But maybe it won't next time. Not great risk to reward imo.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is why people have a lot of success buying calls on MSFT and V and MCD on the 'dips'. You can always get fucked on a lane change, but that is less frequent. But once you see that a channel has been broken, probably best to be patient and not trade it (or yolo puts or something, but that is risky).", "created_utc": 1569508963, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d9kksx/easy_medium_and_hard_to_trade/", "is_self": true}
