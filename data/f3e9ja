I personally love ROKU and have been on it since it was around 100 earlier this year. I feel like ROKU is going to have a great call and I think if a lot of it's success is attributed to DIS, this will lead into positive gains for DIS. \n\nToday I bought a $145 call for February 21st... honestly hoping to see Disney rise to at least $145, but maybe if some more good news comes $150... any thoughts or am I fucked?", "created_utc": 1581618188, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3e9ja/do_you_think_roku_will_increase_dis_share_price/", "is_self": true}
