I think i did it accurately to the best of my ability.\n\nWhy isn't everyone loading up on any call price for infinity gains. What happens when you have infinite money? Can you buy the fed and force it to print infinite money? Can you use the infinite money to buy even more QQQs to send algos buying into the next dimension?
