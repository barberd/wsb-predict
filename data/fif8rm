{"id": "fif8rm", "title": "Virgin galactic warrants redemption", "selftext": "News came out that SPCE is liquidating their public warrants in a cashless transaction where the average Joe doesn\u2019t have to pay for exercise but he only receives about 0.5 (half) of shares at $11.50 for the held amount of warrants.\n\nQuick googling revealed, total shares 196mil, warrants 27mil. The numbers are likely a bit off but good enough for the rough estimate.\n\nWarrants when exercised dilute the outstanding shares. 27mil warrants when exercised should increase the outstanding shares by 13.5mil (0.5 factor) which is about 6-7% increase. \n\nAll unexercised warrants expire on April 13.\n\nhttps://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200313005549/en/Virgin-Galactic-Announces-Redemption-Public-Warrants\n\nTLDR: SPCE drop will accelerate soon, easy 6-7% move on these news alone. Buy $10p one month out or a bunch of FDs if you feel spicy.\n\nDisclaimer: Not a financial advise.
