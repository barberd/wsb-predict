[Stimulus version 3.00](https://en.as.com/en/2020/05/07/other_sports/1588852610_686223.html)\n\nStates and cities are going to go BK if there\u2019s no funding included in the next package. McConnell doesn\u2019t want a \u201cblue states bail out\u201d. Trump want to include hotels and immigrations money in the next package. Regardless of your leaning, can you imagine the repercussion if New York BK? There will be another stimulus next 3 weeks.\n\n2.)[States are reopening](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html)\n\n3.)

If you are saving money, don\u2019t expect to get any yield on your saving account. High yield saving account will become no yield saving account. Odds are mortgage rates will lower = real estate\u2019s prices will go up. Stocks will go up in value.\n\n**Strategies:** get calls as states start to reopen. People have been staying at home, playing games (ATVI) smoking weed ( TLRY), and drinking beer. Once they get back to work, they will be realized things are not back to normal. It\u2019s bleak out there. Then **PUTS** after Georgia realized they have to shut back down again.\n\nStart looking at **SPY $315C June 19.**", "created_utc": 1588905654.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gfktsg/bear_admitting_stonks_go_up_for_the_next_3_weeks/", "is_self": true}
