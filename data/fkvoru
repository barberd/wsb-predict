{"id": "fkvoru", "title": "Impending Housing Market Crash SPY 200p 6/19", "selftext": "In states like California and New York where housing pries have reached astronomical levels, we're going to start seeing people unable to make rent/mortgage payments.\n\nEven with the proposed $1000 check to every American,  where do you think that money is going to go? To rent? To mortgages? Nah people who don't have an emergency fund or barely enough of an emergency fund are going to prioritize buying food and essentials. That leaves many places starting to default.\n\nNot only that I'm sure everyone has heard that many industries are being closed down to stop the spread of the beer virus. How do you think businesses are going to pay their rents at their brick and mortar stores? They're NOT. These commercial mortgages/leases have much higher rents/payments per month than your average residential property. AND they usually have stipulations in their leases of a prepayment penalty. Basically if you pay off your commercial mortgage early for the coffee shop you own down the street ,  in most states you are required to pay a prepayment \"balloon\" payment interest rate on top of the amount already due.\n\nI know a few people in the real estate industry that have gotten laid off already. Their companies owns 30,000+ apartments and other properties across the country. What happens if a majority of those people stop paying rents? Real Estate uses leverage to the max to generate profits so many of these huge real estate companies are borrowed to the fucking max.\n\nEven major commercial property developments (That cost Millions and some nearly billions of dollars) are on complete hold. The mortgage loans on these projects depend heavily on time to complete the project. Basically the more time a project is held the more losses a developer is going to incur. To put this into perspective ,  developments in california cost upwards of 20-500 million dollars. These are the guys building massive buildings and creating new neighborhoods in developing cities. THEY ARE ABOUT TO GO BANKRUPT.\n\nBasically the housing market is screwed the more time we spend in a lockdown.\n\nNow we've seen other countries that have frozen rent and mortgages like Italy.  By doing this ,  everybody who pays rent/mortgages would be bailed out. This would be a nuclear event that Trump would most likely never allow to happen here in the US due for many reasons.\n\nThe question is how big is this crash going to be? The first month people who are renting in low income neighborhoods are going to start being late on their payments. This will amplify in the next couple of months to higher economic classes as more time goes by.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: SPY 200p 6/19 and/or Z 15p 4/24", "created_utc": 1584560393.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkvoru/impending_housing_market_crash_spy_200p_619/", "is_self": true}
