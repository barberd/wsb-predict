Also, if it hits $14 or below, you may want to consider giving it a second chance.\n\nBecause I am gay, I decided to go through the historical book value to price ratio for STNG and found some magic numbers that may help tanker gang be at rest about at least breaking even. By averaging the historical BP ratio, I got an average of the stock price trading 25% below book value (or NAV if you wanna go there).\n\nWhat is the current book value? $37.05. \n\nDo some elementary math and you get the magical number of $27.78 per share expected price range.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is still pretty heavily based on the oil futures that expire next week but it should be seen as more of a shorter to mid term price target (god forbid you baghold these shit companies for anything longer than 6 months)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWorst case scenario?\n\nThe absolute most dogshit BP ratio this company has put out is .38. Which is a downside risk of about $14.07. \n\nSo, the play here is if retail investors keep dumping and the stock price hits $14 or below, consider buying it and holding till Q3 or Q4, and if it hits $27.78, dump that shit. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlways remember, I am autistic and anything I say should be taken with a grain of salt and a 4 piece nugget from MD's.", "created_utc": 1589745824.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/glm99w/stng_still_has_hope_just_not_as_much_as_youre/", "is_self": true}
