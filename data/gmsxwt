Analyst Catharine Trebnick said, \"We are upgrading Palo Alto Networks to a Buy from Neutral and establishing a $260 PT as conversations with resellers and CISOs suggest product revenues have re-accelerated coming off two quarters of consecutive weakness. Conversations suggest the company benefited from product refresh as organizations set up new VPN connections to enable remote working. Investors have been focused on product growth the last few quarters due to poor execution. The vast majority of our checks were positive on the quarter and suggested improved demand and solid pipeline headed into FQ4. We are expecting management will guide revenues roughly in line with the Street consensus of +14%. The company will report Q3'20 results after the close on Thursday, May 21st.\"", "created_utc": 1589908945.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gmsxwt/palo_alto_network_panw_upgrade_details_daugherty/", "is_self": true}
