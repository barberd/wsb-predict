Here are some reputable news sources that have written about it:\n\n* [Nobody Wants a Margin Call Right Now]( https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2020-03-26/money-stuff-nobody-wants-a-margin-call-right-now) - Bloomberg (by Matt Levine)\n\n* [Esports Stadium Arlington to Host Stock Options Trading Championship]( https://esportsobserver.com/esports-stadium-arlington-wsb) \u2013 Esports Observer\n\n* [Wild markets set stage for winner-take-all trading competition]( https://www.investmentnews.com/wild-markets-trading-competition-190598) - Investment News\n\n* WSB Announces First Live Trading Championship \u2013 (Press Release) found on [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wallstreetbets-announces-first-live-trading-110000567.html), [AP](https://apnews.com/Business%20Wire/44bde858888d487c85e29a442c1ede6a), [Street Insider](https://www.streetinsider.com/Business+Wire/WallStreetBets+Announces+First+Live+Trading+Championship/16665169.html), [Market Screener](https://www.marketscreener.com/news/WallStreetBets-Announces-First-Live-Trading-Championship--30256362/), [BusinessWire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200326005099/en/WallStreetBets-Announces-Live-Trading-Championship), [Digital Journal](http://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/4633412), [Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/20/03/b15670385/wallstreetbets-announces-first-live-trading-championship)\n\n#**How will the contestants be picked? How can I apply?**\n\nWe will open up contestant applications in the coming weeks along with any requirements (relevant citizenship, 18 years old, etc\u2026).  At that point we will also list out the rules and criteria which will used for the selection.  There will be \u201cqualifier rounds\u201d which will be fully transparent and open to the public to watch.  At the end of the process, we will have the final contestants for the WSB Championship.\n\nContestants will deposit a predetermined amount of money into a personal broker account which will be used for the competition.  Anything they make (or lose) during the competition will be theirs, in addition to the prize money awarded to the winner.\n\n#**What\u2019s the prize?**\n\nThe prize will be big, between 6 and 7 figures.  The final amount will be announced in the coming weeks.\n\n#**How are you paying for it?**\n\nThe prize money is coming from the primary sponsor of the event, [True Trading Group]( https://truetradinggroup.com/wallstreetbets/?cc=WSBTTG&cp=30).  This has been mentioned in all the press releases linked above:  \n> True Trading Group (TTG) will provide the proceeds for the WSB Championship prize.\n\n#**What about the beer virus?**\n\nWe\u2019re seriously hoping that COVID-19 is under control by October, in which case we will proceed with the live audience.  But if there are any sort of restrictions in place by then, the entire event will also be streamed online.\n\n#**Do you have a lawyer?**\n\nYes.  Many of them.\n\n#**You\u2019re going to get options banned for everyone**\n\nDerivative market is 17 times greater than the actual equities market.  Estimated to be around $1.2 quadrillion dollars globally (although not all with options).  If 12 people get together and legally trade them for a couple days shuts down that market, then the financial system has bigger problems on its hands than WSB. \n\n\n\n#**STFU and change the logo!** \n\nI hear you, we\u2019re fixing the logo. I\u2019ll be making a post about that this weekend.", "created_utc": 1585348267.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fq7f3m/faq_about_the_wsb_championship/", "is_self": true}
