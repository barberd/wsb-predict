Right before the press conf, BA bottomed out and now huge green candle appears.\n2. I go Buy 500 shares of BA - Long \n3. Donny walks into the mic.\n4. My position is Green. I hit sell button. Perfect trade , right ? \n5. Donny starts talking Chinese and a huge red candle appears.\n6. My P/L is showing I am up $2000 on BA. I am like WTF ? I am confused AF.\n7. I look at BA position and it says I own 2000 Shares. When I hit the Sell button previously to close the 500 shares position, I actually closed my 500 shares long positions and also sold 2000 shares and I now I am short 2000. I might have pushed buttons on my mouse.\n8. Donny still talking Cantonese and Mandarin. I hit the flatten button and exit the trade while the candle is still red with a profit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wmg7ilcaot151.png?width=1261&format=png&auto=webp&s=89d4fe9fe314d6f545456c5c9b239de4af1de5bf", "created_utc": 1590809740.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gt7cob/i_am_having_trouble_with_my_brain_and_hand/", "is_self": true}
