{"id": "gimew8", "title": "SPY is overvalued, imo", "selftext": "I've seen a lot of DD on why \"We'Re RaPiDlY ApPrOAcHiNg tHe NeXT leG DoWN\" so I don't blame you for becoming desensitized to the doom and gloom... but if you've been paying attention to some good \"canaries in the coalmines\" so to speak, the statement actually might hold some water.\n\nFor whatever reason, you retards seem particularly TA averse, so I will try to keep my pretty crayons to a minimum.\n\nFirstly, [I have an included a graph of US equity fund flows cross-referenced with the graph of the SP500.](https://imgur.com/XG59MP1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[SP 500 vs Cumulative US Equity Fund Flows](https://preview.redd.it/hl3iwcf72fy41.png?width=490&format=png&auto=webp&s=08402ce620c2ee3dab513be2663ec3836ca7896f)\n\nThere are multiple ways to look at this graph, but for the sake of the argument, the darker blue line that represents Cumulative US Equity Fund Flows can be viewed as \"Smart Money positioning\". I.e., it represents just how bearish institutional investors are (notice that it is negative). Now, institutions have been bullish ever since we touched those sexy sexy march lows, but around May 1st a divergence has been growing between increasing equity pricing and the negative equity fund flows. It's almost as if Smart MoneyTM is anticipating something... Notice, every time one of these divergences has formed previously, either the SP500 or the funds flows has corrected as to converge. So for the next correction, who is wrong? Institutions or the irrationally bullish S&P? Fair question.\n\nNext, let's take a look at the CBOE put/call ratio for yesterday ([May 11th](https://markets.cboe.com/us/options/market_statistics/daily/)). Taking a look at the PCR for equities, we find that it has been becoming increasingly bullish since march lows, and has reached its most bullish level (.50) since the peak on February 20th. What does this mean? Volume (not open interest) for calls on equities exceeded volume for puts by double. What happened last time this happened? It didn't end too well for bulls. Interesting that this bullish sentiment on equities is also arriving at a time when new BTFD retail investors are flooding into TD, Robinhood, etc. (Evidenced by a spike in equity holdings)\n\nOk, maybe these are micro-chasms of a larger argument, and can be easily dismissed. Sure. Let's take a look at [a chart of SPY](https://imgur.com/2KHX9W8), crayons aside, for all of you retards who are holding 300 calls that expire in may.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[SPY 1 hour](https://preview.redd.it/k7lp9x0b2fy41.png?width=1564&format=png&auto=webp&s=d03d2f037214d0d92222b5ec18b636a75536c2d3)\n\nThe SPY has only been able to break above 295 for 8 months in its history, and only after struggling. There is an immense amount of selling pressure that exists around the 295/6 level, as evidenced by the last two recent attempts to break it. As a bull, your thesis would be: \"In a time of economic dismay, with the GDP contracting, unemployment reaching record levels in record time, a wave of bankruptcies brimming on the horizon, the US economy staring down the barrel of a multi-decade deflationary spiral, I believe that the SP500 can return to historically overbought and unsustainable price levels piggybacking almost exclusively on monetary policy\", More power to you, and you know what, you'd have printed for the past two months with that thesis. But be wary of continued upside.\n\nMaybe bulls will continue to make money. Maybe not. Feel free to correct me in the comments, I'm constantly trying to expand my understanding and am perfectly open to being wrong.\n\nPositions: I got short at 292, SPY 280p 8/21\n\nAlternatives: Any long dated SPY put, nothing expiring sooner than 3-4 months", "created_utc": 1589323993.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gimew8/spy_is_overvalued_imo/", "is_self": true}
