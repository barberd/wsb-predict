{"id": "gf2xj1", "title": "Is this strategy retarded? I really feel like I was on to something but I want everyautist\u2019s opinion (serious).", "selftext": "I took my account from 8k -> 40k back in the end of March. It peaked on 3/23 from SPY puts. Of course I was a \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b and lost almost all of it with SPY 200p 4/20, got out when I was up about 1.5k so a little profit from the start. But in the last week I was trying to save my puts by day trading SPY options. I made $12,468 in a week day trading with an account worth about 30k (70% cash 30% puts).\n\nI had over 25k so no PDT rule. My strategy was to buy 15-17k in spy options, in favor of whichever way the ticker was trending up or down, and sell them at a limit price once they gained anywhere from 1-4%. The mean of all 38 trades that week totaled to $328.11 which is a 2.05% gain per trade with 16k. I could have made more if I had used the entire 21k cash I had but I did not want to risk all of the money I had to my name.\n\nIn 5 trading days, off of 38 trades I had 100% accuracy. Every one of my trades was a hit because I wasn\u2019t waiting for the one big return. I took my profits as soon as they came in and since they were ranging from $65 lowest gain - $1040 highest gain I felt good walking away from each trade having made on average over $300 per.\n\nI was so focused on taking a piece of the whole pie with my 200p 4/20, that I completely skipped the easy money that\u2019s in the crumbs. My account dropped below 25k after buying more puts and I took everything out of RH and I got a 90 day ban from day trading that expires on June 27th. Come Monday, June 29th I\u2019m going to try my strategy again starting with $1,000 and I\u2019ll compound my weekly gains adding a little bit of cash every month until I get to 25k and then the big money will start coming in.\n\nTLDR: Lost everything SPY 220p, but developed a strategy that earned me $12,468 in one week with 100% accuracy on 38 trades. I want to do it again but I\u2019m starting small to see if I just got lucky with going 38/38 profitable trades in a row.", "created_utc": 1588841439.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gf2xj1/is_this_strategy_retarded_i_really_feel_like_i/", "is_self": true}
