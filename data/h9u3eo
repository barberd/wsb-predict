Today was ToS shitting the bed. It could have just as easily been tastyworks or RH or any other. If it's going to **happen**, you may as well prepare and have a plan for it so you don't get caught with your little pecker exposed.\n\n**(1)** Confirm the issue is the broker. Check latency with googles DNS server or some shit IDK just google how to check if my internet is good. \n\n**(2)** Ask yourself how badly you really need to trade rn. Have some far OTM bear credit spreads and the underlying is trending further down? Leave your shit alone. Watch the market somewhere else. You're part of the problem if you don't save those resources for people trying to exit or open positions.\n\n**(3)** Use other methods available to execute trades. This depends on your brokerage. I use ToS so to my knowledge I can use the TDA app, website, chat bot, ToS app, and finally via phone call. Figure out which of these options is best suited to various issues before you need them. \n\n**(4)** Do you need to cut losses? If your limit orders aren't getting filled because your data is old, it might be time to go market order to put a stop to the bleeding.", "created_utc": 1592272551.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h9u3eo/what_to_do_when_your_shitty_app_crashes/", "is_self": true}
