[https://imgur.com/a/sUade3H](https://imgur.com/a/sUade3H) Doesn't include my two $80 TSLA FDs that expired worthless early in feb.\n\nHere's what I use to track my shit cause my broker is gay.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yvu6j2m5vdk41.png?width=1013&format=png&auto=webp&s=2fed5abcc69ec1871ae66ced018564bbf85ad209\n\nLook, I know it sucks losing money. 3 years ago I lost a bunch of money on a really dumb investment and felt really shitty about myself and took a break from active investing for almost 2 years. It was the best decision I ever made.\n\nIf you've lost a bunch of money the past few weeks you need to stop investing in options right now and take a break from everything related to the market. You need to take a long hard look in the mirror and be honest about all of the reasons why you made the decisions you made. Until you can rationally accept your own retardedness, you will never be able to overcome your inner retard to make better investment decisions in the future.\n\nI'm not going to respond to all my DMs from today but here are some of the things I've learned from failing previously which might be helpful to you.\n\n**1.** **Don't chase.** You can either be chasing or you can be anticipating. You can\u2019t be both. YOLO is funny and has a great reddit gold dividend yield, but at some point it\u2019s nice to make dollars . And not just once cause you\u2019re lucky.\n\n**2. Make a list.** Every trade I make I need to be able to write down three reasons why I\u2019m making the trade, and three reasons why I could be wrong. Writing down the ways I could be wrong helps me manage my risk and size the position. Don't set yourself up for a devastating loss. Options are insanely high risk. If you're putting more than 5-10% of your total portfolio into options trading you're a fucking retard.\n\n**Here are some of the things I listed out as reasons to buy my puts 2nd/3rd week of Feb**, almost at the tippy top. [Here are some of my very amateur charts that show some of these things iI was looking at at the time f its helpful to you.](https://imgur.com/a/o12WrQB)\n\n\\- massive bearish capitulations. CBOE equity/put call ratio was at near record lows through Feb, massive capitulation in open short interest on indices.- NDX was wildly over extended. Almost 3 std. devs above 200 MA, weekly RSI approaching tech bubble levels- very poor breadth across indices. Big tech was pulling up NDX and S&P but breadth across all major indices was indicating a top- corona virus economic impacts building in the background but market just kept ignoring it- corona aside, lots of underlying economic fundamentals to be worried about- plunging yields (even before stonks imploded), poor JOLTS through Feb, declines in shipping, trucking etc. The list goes on.\n\nMy goal with the puts was to see a reversion to the 200 MA across SPX and NDX and close when it approached.\n\n**Here are some of the things I listed before I closed all my puts but one last week and bought calls on Thursday and Friday.**\n\n\\- NDX approaching 200 day MA and then hard bounced- VIX shit like I already posted- very rapid skew to equity and index puts over the course of all the selling last week\n\nThe list of reasons to not do the trade was pretty good so I limited it to like 7-8%ish of what I wanted to have invested in options, which was like a tiny part of my portfolio and wouldn't kill me if I was wrong. I also left open my longest dated put from earlier in feb as a hedge.\n\n**When you exit a trade write down what you could have done better. Systematic learning is the only way to consistently make money and train yourself out of trading on emotion/retardation**\n\n\\- I closed out one of my SQQQ positions early today. **SQQQ is super gay.** NEVER TRADE OPTIONS ON SQQQ. Fuck SQQQ.\n\n**Don\u2019t make a trade unless the trade comes to you.** Patiently sitting in cash waiting for a high probability trade opportunity to come to you is 9 times out of 10 going to make you more money than rushing in to something. If you miss a move let it go. Never fucking chase.\n\n**Follow peeps on Fintwit** Lots of amazing hedge fund guys posting insightful shit on fintwit. Get on there and follow a bunch of people with opposing views on stuff. It will help you build a filter for what's right and what's BS which will make you a better decision maker. If you only read news sites like bloomberg or marketwatch you will always be poor.\n\n**The best trades are always non-obvious.** Some people pervert this and become perma bulls or perma bears. Look at Peter Schiff. That dude made a huge non-obvious bet ahead of the housing collapse and then was wrong like 9 times out of 10 for like 10 years straight after that. The guy is right sometimes and retarded most of the time. Don't be like him.\n\n**STOP FUCKING ASKING ME WHAT THE MOVES ARE FOR TOMORROW** If you feel the need to make a move every day you will always be poor.\n\n**TLDR In the long run WSBgod loses all his money and prudent WSBers make bank.**", "created_utc": 1583210033.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fcp9mb/a_letter_to_all_of_my_haters_some_tips_for_not/", "is_self": true}
