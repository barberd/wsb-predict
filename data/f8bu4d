{"id": "f8bu4d", "title": "$PTON unusual otm calls", "selftext": "Idk who buys this shit but on 3/20 it has 100k OI on calls and 60k on puts. What's odd is that 31k of the calls are for a $50 strike price, and $pton is trading at $25.25 after falling damn near 40% in the last few months. These calls are .03 right now.\n\nI'll be honest I'm intrigued. Especially because robinhood is telling me it's a 91% buy. It has to be a good move then.", "created_utc": 1582475938, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f8bu4d/pton_unusual_otm_calls/", "is_self": true}
