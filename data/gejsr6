Through my experience with RH there have been several occasions where there is clearly someone/something on the other side of the application(maybe AI)intent on trying to fuck my trades. \n\nFor example: I opened up some more complex option trades that aren't pre-loaded into app the other day and when I went to leg out of each one individually for profit the app forced closed each trade submission.  \n\nAfter the great crash, rejecting their $75 offer and joining the class action, they deleted all trade information of the affected trades from history.\n\nYesterday, I performed over 50 day trades in one day and got a 30k+ day trade call(closing out positions and never intended on using again). I'm assuming I crashed their AI which is why you're getting emails.\n\nI am the reason you woke up to the emails and got flagged. Actually, no I'm not, I clearly triggered it and they must be using an AI system that glitched out.
