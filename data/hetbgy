Morgan Stanley LLC recently disclosed the following \"Structured investment / Opportunity in U.S. Equities\" on 6/19/2020\n\nSee: https://www.streetinsider.com/dr/news.php?id=17027495&gfv=1\n\nI read it and think I understand the basics but am baffled this complex security is even thing. Like the coupon on this dependent on the stock price which really makes me think it'll encourage owners of it to manipulate ZM and pump it every quarter to guarantee payout on the coupons. Am I understanding this correctly? \n\nI find this paragraph a bit sketchy, under \"Hedging and trading activity by our affiliates could potentially adversely affect the value of the securities\"\n\n\"Any of these hedging or trading activities on or prior to the pricing date could potentially increase the initial share price, and, as a result, could potentially increase the downside threshold price, which is the price at or above which the underlying stock must close on each determination date in order for you to earn a contingent quarterly coupon, and, if the securities are not called prior to maturity, in order for you to avoid being exposed to the negative price performance of the underlying stock at maturity. Additionally, such hedging or trading activities during the term of the securities could potentially affect the price of the underlying stock on the determination dates, and, accordingly, whether the securities are automatically called prior to maturity, and, if the securities are not called prior to maturity, the payout to you at maturity, if any\"\n\nAnother question is who the hell buys this and where the hell do you even buy this? The document states:\n\n\"The securities will not be listed on any securities exchange and secondary trading may be limited\"\n\nI am so confused why such a security is even allowed to exist, can anyone explain why this is a thing? Why can't zoom just sell bonds or sell shares if they need cash, why this?\n\nFor the record I am short $ZM and getting rekt.", "created_utc": 1592969010.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hetbgy/what_are_contingent_income_autocallable/", "is_self": true}
