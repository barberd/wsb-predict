People smarter than me like my husband's boyfriend tried to explain that the crash for oil was limited to WTI was for contracts for this month. That contracts for other months like May and June are trading *above zero dollars*. Ultimately, this won't really matter. Demand still low. It costs money to store oil. Yada yada yada. US crude production etc. firms and other industries that can't deal with oil so low are going underwater. Quick.\n\nNot sure what other autists have been seeing, but other commodoties going the way of oil too (someone else said this elsewhere, but it's weird that oil etc. better reflect the fundamentals to the economy than S&P, but that's an analysis for a different way. Indices might be rational at the moment in light of JPOW). \n\nhttps://twitter.com/RaoulGMI/status/1252396835202715655?s=20\n\nThis thread has a good overview. Corn, soy beans, sugar all on the process to cratering. Milk in a similar spot. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s looking very grim right now. We\u2019ve been told there is 10 percent too much milk in the country, and even if every plant opened up that was closed due to all the manufacturing being shut down, it would take a while for the milk to clear,\u201d Yeaton said.\n\nhttps://www.unionleader.com/news/health/coronavirus/as-milk-gets-dumped-nationally-dairy-farmers-in-nh-nervous-about-their-futures-during-covid/article_f9f5167c-42ca-5934-b534-1da6395c0c25.html\n\nRIP to farmers. Think Donnie has enough in his bank account to keep Carnival, Boeing, Exxon and the Mid West solvent?\n\nAt this point, deflation is an obvious concern. There's an alternative theory that farmers will basically pour milk on the ground and drive crops into the dirt to meet margins or diminish loss. At that point, we than have a supply shortage. Some nerds at NASA think the sun won't shine as bright this year. This is important for the sake of agriculture.\n\nhttps://www.almanac.com/news/astronomy/astronomy/solar-minimum-approaching-mini-ice-age\n\nNot the article I saw earlier, but from what I can gather, it's going to be hard to grow as many crops next cycle. Start with low prices like we have now, farmers react and create a lower supply, prices go up, can't grow as much next year, low supply, prices go up, inflation go up bigly. You get the idea. \n\nTLDR: Economy is bad. Gay bear szn will be upon us eventually. Bankruptcies gonna go up bigly. The crystal ball says some deflation could be coming.
