Then something changed.\n\nFirst it was a \"natural correction\" but then it became something more. TARIFFS ON CHINA AND CHINESE GOODS. THE TRADE WAR.\n\nEvery time the US equity markets threatened to pass S&amp;P 2929, the White House would announce more and bigger tariffs on China.\n\nEVERY TIME. Go back, check it out.\n\nThis went on for about twenty or twenty two months.\n\n==== ==== =====\n\nNow that impeachment is the word of the day, whoever was doing all that market manipulation has given up slightly, or stopped paying attention. They were hoping to do this Grand Run-Up nearer to election time, but now is as good a time as any. \"How can you say I'm doing a bad job, America?!? The stock market is at an ALL-TIME-HIGH!\"\n\nExpect to hear that a lot, for the next year, as the White House's \"trade war\" winds down.", "created_utc": 1576774872, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ecvz2n/white_house_finally_takes_its_thumb_off_the_scale/", "is_self": true}
