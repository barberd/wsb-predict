{"id": "f9eo3o", "title": "Virgin Galactic (SPCE) 2/25/2020 AMC - FEELS &gt; REALS", "selftext": "Stock: **Virgin Galactic (SPCE)**\n\nDirection: **Mixed Bullish**\n\n**Price Target:** **40$**\n\n**Type: Call Credit Spread, Put Credit Spread**\n\n**Fundamental:** lol\n\n**Technical**: Priced above in 20, 50 day moving averages, no 200D average yet.  MACD shows bullish convergence. RSI shows around 72, coming down from massively overbought. Options sentiments are bullish in volume and bullish open interest. **Implied movement of about 23% or 8.05$. Short interest rate is 19%, about 1.15 days to cover, and about 37% of total available float is shorted.** SPCE is currently considered \u201chard to borrow\u201d, putting pressure and fees on short sellers. **19% institutional ownership = much more sentiment and retail driven.**\n\n**Sentimental**: There are several key factors at play for SPCE\u2019s earnings this quarter. The first factor is the updated timetable regarding commercial flights. Previously, SPCE stated that first commercial flights will begin Q1/Q2 2020. **If the flight timetable is reinforced or even confirmed, it can be a very strong catalyst to keep the stock up.** Second factor at play is the revenue accrued from reservation deposits. **In September 2019, SPCE annouced they have 600 tickets sold, amounting to about 80M in revenue. As of 2/24/2020, SPCE\u2019s website noted that all tickets have been sold out.** While a 750k revenue on 7.3B market cap seems dumb, the accrued revenue from reservations would be the biggest factor in the operational performance area. The last factor at play is the **potential for SPCE to announce an equity raise given the stock\u2019s current high price.** **Depending on the price and shares released, it can materially affect the stock\u2019s price downwards**. A 4th issue was concluded merely yesterday, as **SPCE finally registered its warrants.** This prevents a cashless exercise scenario, which would hurt the stock price due to a brief, but massive influx of shares. While total dilution would be smaller by 12 million or about 60%, a cashless exercise will wreck the short-term float. 31 million shares over the course of 5 years is much more manageable. One last factor is the current macro psychology**. Because we are near the tail end of the longest bull run in American history, traders are looking for even more aggressive trades to pull even higher returns.**\n\nThe question for this earnings is entirely a retail fueled sentiment show. If SPCE can keep up the retail hype through news and announcements, it can lead retail to stay stubborn with price action. In addition, since most of the price is driven by retail purchases, price action will reflect much more of the sentiments, rather than anything logical. Chance of a sustained short squeeze is almost nothing due to 1.15 SI Ratio.\n\n**ROI : 31%, 98%**\n\n**Risk Level - 5 of 5, Educated Gambling.** \n\n[Robinhood SS](https://imgur.com/a/EKJX7Tq)\n\nYou can't ~~reason~~ with SPCE.
