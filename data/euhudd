{"id": "euhudd", "title": "Beer Virus vs Earnings Week", "selftext": "The time has come for the ultimate showdown.\n\nBeer virus vs Earnings week lead by the tech giants!\n\n\nEverything seems to suggest that the beer virus has won Game 1 before it's even begun, and they might be right without a big bat on Monday.. not like we can expect Whirlpool to hit a homerun.\n\nAAPL is going to kill in game 2. Expect a late game grand slam, and if the market hasn't already been swayed in favor of the tech giants and earnings week, AAPL will convince them otherwise. Game 2 will also consist of AMD batting .320 like it always does, and even if it slumps early, it'll be back to hitting .320 by the end of the week. \n\nGame 3 could be a huge game for TSLA.. can TSLA really continue to bat a red hot .700 for a whole series and keep knocking in RBIs at a godly pace? My bet is yes. But it will be MSFT who brings home Game 3 and carries the team through the rest of the week. Expect a monster homerun that signifies the death of team beer virus.. one of those games where you feel the breath absolutely knocked out of the opponent. FB will choke, going 2-31 this series.\n\nGame 4 is just a continuation of team earnings game 2 and 3 victories and AMZN shines with a 3-5 day with a few RBIs, nothing incredible but enough to seal the victory for team earnings. Regardless of how game 5 plays out, the series was won here.\n\n\nMSFT 150c's and 160c's\nTSLA 6/2020 700c\nAMD 1/2021 30c and couple hundred shares\nAlways holding shares of GOOG\n253 shares of TQQQ\n\nMSFT will be MVP.", "created_utc": 1580094476, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/euhudd/beer_virus_vs_earnings_week/", "is_self": true}
