{"id": "fn3lnj", "title": "That sweet Grocery DD you want to hear about.", "selftext": "Alright, listen up and take this advice from someone who is an insider in the Grocery Industry.\n\n  \n\n**How much $$$ are the stores actually making?**\n\nHere is what to expect when those companies begin releasing their next quarterly earnings report.  Since March 8 (most companies are using that specific date to measure), same store sales at our Company have increased by **80-90%** (this does not include online sales), and it does not appear to be slowing down (this is grocery sales, not including other consumer goods like clothing).  Consumers are going absolutely crazy for just about everything, except for produce (although that still has higher tonnage).  Non-perishables and anything you can freeze is flying off the shelves at a record pace.  \n\nConsumers have also embraced online grocery shopping like you haven\u2019t seen with massive spikes in volume.  Most locations (in-store pickups and deliveries) are having multi day delays because they can\u2019t keep up with the sheer amount of online volume.  I would expect this trend towards online shopping to continue well into the future.  \n\nHowever, I caution people when stores say they have had massive sales increases in online ordering.  Right now it is not very profitable, if at all.  Most stores offer it is a convenience service to their customer base \u2013 someone picking your order at a store adds about 30 minutes of labor, which wipes out a very good chunk of an already thin profit margin.\n\n \n\n**Are Grocery stores going to run out of product soon, if not, why are their shelves empty?**\n\nNot at the moment.  The reason you are seeing shelves empty is because of the massive spike in volume and delays in the logistics networks.  Grocery volume in warehousing networks, aside from a few spikes in the year is typically very consistent, so the need to flex is usually just around very specific eating holidays and usually filled with some overtime.  This is unprecedented in terms of volume spikes.\n\nMost major grocers run an automation order picking system (nothing is fully automated at the moment) and some still run a conventional one.  Both have their flaws when it comes to massive spikes in volume.  Right now, grocers who are running auto pick systems are seeing massive backlogs because they are only designed to pick X number of pieces per hour and you can\u2019t just turn up the speed like a conveyor belt.  Those systems have some flex built in for those eating holidays, but would typically run at 75-80% capacity on a normal day.  When massive volume spikes happen, the system gets backed up and it keeps building, right now many of these systems are days behind.  The only way to clear the backlog is to either pull products out of the automated pick system or to wait for it to clear as volume gets lower.  Grocers who are on a conventional pick system can flex their labor a bit better, but still will have problems when it comes to having enough equipment to get the product out and likely won\u2019t have enough casual labour just hanging around to compensate.  Further to that, pick paths and items are built to a specific volume and congestion level, so volume spikes still cause problems.\n\nMost problems are caused at the moment by logistics, not item shortages, except for certain things (like hand sanitizer).\n\n  \n\n**Are they price gouging?**\n\nI don\u2019t have access to price files or back end supply, but yes, certain products are going up in price (especially cleaning products) since this outbreak.  That may not be a function of grocers though, it may also be a supplier issue as they now have to run OT at their factories to make the products.\n\n  \n\n**Who is best positioned for this?**\n\nWalmart and Amazon are the 2 big ones.  Stores with a prominent online presence and the ability to actually make money from it.  Costco to a slightly lesser extent (the reason I am not as bullish on Costco is because I understand their profit model is based on membership sales, not item margin, so while their sales are massive, they may not make the same profit margin on it that others will).\n\n**TDLR:** Don\u2019t sleep on Grocery.", "created_utc": 1584898960.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fn3lnj/that_sweet_grocery_dd_you_want_to_hear_about/", "is_self": true}
