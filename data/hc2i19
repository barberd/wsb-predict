It's not as in depth as the usual DDs I post.\n\nIVR: has been having a hard time and everyone expects them to report terrible numbers on Monday. This in fact is true. It's hard to know how bad the numbers will be. Will it be bad but less bad than expected? probably. This one a true gamble. I'd stay away from this unless you know something I don't know. I wrote a very small number of naked puts. \n\nWinnebago: I have been hearing through the grapevine that they all selling anything they can build and have sold all their unsold inventory. All the discounts are gone as sell which will help their margins. The stock is just shy of its ATH. I am willing to bet that we will see new ATHs next week. I bought 10k worth of calls expiring next Friday.\n\nNikola motors: I watched the annualized cost to borrow interest rate go from -200% to -500% over the last few days. The short interest on this is as irrational as the price. I was shorting it initially but the interest got too steep. Considering that they will open orders on June 29th and after bad news of yesterday stock remained resilient, I expect the price to remain irrationally high until June 29th. Wrote some naked puts for June 26th. Essentially I am betting on \"markets can remain irrational longer than \\[bears\\] can remain solvent\" kinda an idea. This is a highly risky strategy so I definitely do not recommend doing as I did. You are an idiot if you did. \n\nDRI report should not be much of a surprise. Holding options through the earnings report is not wise. I don't anticipate a sustained move of more than 5% after the report. I am not playing this. Avoiding IV crush.\n\nRAD: Wall street seems to be bullish on this. But I'm not. Their OTC sales will be higher as hypochondriacs stocked up on all sorts of stuff but their prescription sales should be lower due to people avoiding to go to their doctors. OTC which is higher profit margin should help them deliver a beat. A small pop may show up after earnings.\n\nIn general recovery stocks will continue to remain under pressure as media runs with \"Covid Second Wave\" headlines. June and most likely July will be a tad hard on these stocks. September will be good as news of Vaccine eases investor fear.\n\nDisclaimer: These are just my trades and my rational.
