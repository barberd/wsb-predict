They're insanely overvalued. They've been bleeding money since before coronavirus, practically a zombie company and COVID is the shotgun-wielding maniac with a erotic murder fixation. Ford is about to get their brains blown out on earnings 4/28.   \n\n\nThey just announced they're probably in for a $2 billion dollar loss but since earnings are still two weeks away I'm expecting they up that to about $3 billion by the time earnings arrives. $f is still a chunk above $5, should see them hit sub $3 after earnings when they spready their legs and show the world the blue waffle they're hiding in their panties. \n\n\"but they have cash on hand!\" That cash is barely enough to service the grinch mountain of debt they have hanging over them like a looney tunes street piano. They said they're solvent until Q3, but they also said Q1 losses were only 600M a week ago, and now we're at $2B.  \n\n\nPOSITIONS: F $5p 5/1, $4p 5/8, $3.5p 5/15. Get your free money.   \n\n\nIf you say anything about money printer or brr or even J\\*P\\* O\\*W\\* I will skullfuck you with a hedge trimmer", "created_utc": 1587134183.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g336gl/for_the_love_of_all_that_is_holy_how_is_ford_not/", "is_self": true}
