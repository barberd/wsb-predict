{"id": "e7yq7f", "title": "Local DD on Iberia Bank", "selftext": "Before I get started...this is about SHARES not OPTIONS so if you're too fucking self absorbed to keep reading by all means please make yourself a phat glass of Everclear and continue about your dreary, depressing day. \n\n For those of you who aren't familiar with Louisiana, the primary banking corp here is called Iberia Bank ($IBKC). They're trading for $72.57 right now as I'm making this post. I personally do not use Iberia Bank (Capital One Gang), but it's the biggest bank in Louisiana. \n\nSO...Iberia Bank and First Horizon National Bank ($FNH) are merging, First Horizon (trading for $16.01) is the largest bank in Tennessee.   They've agreed on a merger to take place near the end of Q1 2020... Iberia shareholders will receive 4.584 shares of First Horizon for every Iberia share they own, along with a 43% increase in their dividend per share. \n\nAfter the merger, the adjoined companies will have $75 billion in assets, $57 billion in deposits, and $55 billion in loans. \n\nSomething important to understand is that these companies are merging as equals....the CEO of Iberia bank is actually going to be the head executive chairman for the new company and the CEO of First Horizon will retain his title. \n\nThe banks aren't changing ANYTHING after the merger, which is a good thing. These two banks are prestigious as fuck and actively involved in the local communities (not going to list all the charitable giving, look it up), they are combining to focus on growth. The merger is projected to give 16% EPS accretion to First Horizon and 22% for Iberia bank by year end 2021, but personally I think those are modest numbers that will grow higher in a shorter time. \n\nI'm buying as many shares of Iberia Bank as I can afford, especially if the price drops soon. In turn I will receive x(4.58) shares of First Horizon when they actually merge, along with the 43% increase in dividend I was talking about. Basically the dividend for First Horizon will increase from .16 to .20 per share at a quarterly payout rate. \n\nFirst Horizon is also acquiring 30 branches from SunTrust Banks early 2020....Ill admit I know nothing about them.\n\nI'm long First Horizon/Iberia, I think this merger will be 'yuge' and the growth will be insane. \n\nBy the way,,,First Horizon PE ratio: 12.29x...... Iberia PE ratio: 10.66x \n\nQuestions? Thoughts? Concerns? Shares only imo for now....the time to make insane tendies on options will come next year", "created_utc": 1575835917, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e7yq7f/local_dd_on_iberia_bank/", "is_self": true}
