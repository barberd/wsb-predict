I had been waiting for almost 2 months prior to the release of the service. Immediately, when the service was released in the USA, I paid $1 and got it for a week. I watched a lot of Disney princess provides. I watched all of the Marvel movies. I rewatched some of the Disney princess movies. By the end of the first month, I had watched all the movies I wished to and there was nothing more I was interested to watch. Since I was making about $8 in profits from following WSB ideas, I decided to keep the service for one more month. I got billed today, and I realized that I have watched less than 5 hours of content in the past billing cycle. When this hit me, I canceled my subscription.  It was really easy to do. It gave me a good feeling about Netflix and I YOLO'd a Netflix call that expires tomorrow and it's already up $50. \n\n**In Short**, there will be families that will stick to Disney+ because, princess movies and kids stuff. There will be some people who want to Disney+and chill if that'll ever become a thing. But that ain't taking Netflix and Chill away. Long Netflix, even though it's up 10% this week.", "created_utc": 1576783401, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ecxz4m/my_opinions_on_disney/", "is_self": true}
