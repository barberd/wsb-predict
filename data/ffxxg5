{"id": "ffxxg5", "title": "ATVI DD - Free Tendies", "selftext": "Activision has beaten their EPS 4/4 since last year.  If you don't know Activision-Blizzard is responsible for creating Call of Duty, Overwatch, and a few other games.  They're one of the biggest gaming companies in the world.  They are also the biggest player in the E-Sports movement, as they own MLG, and are starting their Call of Duty: Modern Warfare E-Sports League soon, that just got even more sponsors.  They've been hit by corona virus, but not nearly as much as the general stock market, and I believe they should actually have gone up because of the virus.  The only reason that they are lagging behind is because of digital art creation, with around \\~50% internationally taking place in China, and they've already started sourcing from other places.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**China is the biggest consumer of Video Games, with annual revenue of \\~$34 Billion**.  For the same reason that Netflix is up because of the virus, Activision should be up too.  People are quarantined to their houses internationally, left with digital content as their only source of entertainment in their life.  Before the crash, Activision was sitting comfortably at $64, now it's at $58 and there's no logical reason for it to be.  People just got scared that it would follow the general stock market.  The average analyst price target is $68, $10 above where its at this very moment.  Because of this strange oppurtunity, my bet, which I believe to be safe and extremely profitable is\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Buy ATVI $60 Call 5/15 Expiration**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis will guarantee profit, as it is after the EPS, when people will realize the virus was actually good for Activision.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Activision is currently way undervalued because of the virus fear, while it should actually be up.  This is the best buying oppurtunity to capitalize on I have ever seen.  You can check my history, I have been right about a lot of things.  I made $1700 off of an $770 Call on Apple Before The 9% boom.  I predicted the recent 2 day crash.  Trust me on this one.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit : Already made 6% in a few minutes, please upvote so people find out.  I was also just reminded in comments that I predicted the AT&T surge.", "created_utc": 1583773687.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffxxg5/atvi_dd_free_tendies/", "is_self": true}
