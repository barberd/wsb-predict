{"id": "hhmxqu", "title": "Lets be rational autists and think about this whole thing for sec", "selftext": "This phrase \"dont fight the fed\" has gained major popularity, you even got your wive's boyfriend saying it by now. yeah thats all fine and dandy but, how long can the fed keep pumping this shit. just last week  we've confirmed that there will be a second wave. Theres no ifs or buts, its confirmed. so what does that entail.  \n\n\nWell, for starters, the pent up demand is going to remain pent up. Mays numbers had given hopes to everyone that this was all over, that the rona was done for and everything will return to normal quicker than what people thought. Well... WRONG. Nothing is normal, and the market made a terrific bounce from the march lows without such a terrific bounce in the economy.  \n\n\nListen you autist dipshits, SOMETHING IS VERY WRONG HERE. There is a major restructuring of the economy happening right now that hasnt happend since the Great Depression. The service sector is taking a major major hit right now and the future is unclear on how were going to come out of it on the other side.\n\nGDP is 70% consumer spending. this is made up of two things, goods and services. Goods account for 25% of GDP and Services account for 45% of GDP. ([https://www.thebalance.com/components-of-gdp-explanation-formula-and-chart-3306015#:\\~:text=The%20four%20components%20of%20gross,economic%20output%20for%20each%20year.](https://www.thebalance.com/components-of-gdp-explanation-formula-and-chart-3306015#:~:text=The%20four%20components%20of%20gross,economic%20output%20for%20each%20year.))  \n\n\nNow lets be special little autists and put the pieces together. Nikes earning report were worse than expected by quite a lot actually, a whole 38%. what does that mean? well that people arent spending their cash, theyre saving, youve seen the charts. well, there goes the feds stimulus and unemplyment insurance. On top of that, as we all know, the service sector is as FUK as as my puts placed on march 24th. to reiterate to you illiterate bitch ass cock gobling autists, nobody is dining out, nobody is traveling, and nobody in casinos or hotels. rip bars and clubs.  \n\n\nThis is not all, which type of businesses has this whole thing hurt the most? well none other than your uncles small business. your uncles business is among the many that make up 45% of this economy's GDP.([https://www.jpmorganchase.com/corporate/institute/small-business-economic.htm#:\\~:text=Small%20businesses%20accounted%20for%2045,percent%20in%20the%20late%201990s.&text=48%20percent%20of%20all%20US,percent%20in%20the%20early%202000s.](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/corporate/institute/small-business-economic.htm#:~:text=Small%20businesses%20accounted%20for%2045,percent%20in%20the%20late%201990s.&text=48%20percent%20of%20all%20US,percent%20in%20the%20early%202000s.))\n\n Now you inpubesant bull, if even some of the big dogs in businesses are at the brink of bankruptcies, what does that mean for these small businesses? are they going to weather this thing like the likes of apple or microsoft or google? um \\*nervous laughter\\* proboblay not. at least half will close permanently.\n\nSo if 70% of GDP is FUK. the markets right now are in fairyland. straight up rosy sprinkled and evrything.\n\nThere is major uncertainty right now and this will remain for the foreseeable future. Listen, im pretty sure these earning reports are going to be worse than expected, we are half way til we see Q2 numbers for the year and things are looking gloomy. and yet somehow the markets are very close to being at all time highs with a few companies surpassing their ATHs. Tell me, are these companies better off since feb of this year, are the forecasts looking exceptional for growth? um i dont think so you autist peanut.  \n\n\nThere is a major disconnect with the markets and whats going on in the economy. MAJOR. sit back and reflect like the special autist you are. Something is wrong here, very wrong. The fastest 30% drop in history followed by the fastest 46% gain? what kinda bullshit is this? this would make sense if there was a terrorist attack and we've recovered from it, but this whole thing is not over yet as confirmed with the second wave. \n\nThe damage already done is so immense. So immense that the fed nearly doubled it balance sheet in less than a year compared to all of modern history. All of that and this is still not over.. oh no its far from over. the single biggest cases for CV happened 2 DAYS GO. TWO!! IN LATE JUNE! not even september, let alone october and novenmber. rip. sorry guys but in two weeks the CV deaths will begin to rise again. economy is FUK.\n\nMajor Major solvency issue going on here. Can the FED save all these businesses from going bankrupt?? Can the fed keep increasing their balance sheet by a Trilllion dollars every single month till everything returns to normal by august 2021?? That my good sir is at least 12 trillion dollars more. Will the almighty fed increase their their holy balance sheet to 20 trillion dollars?? WILL THEY??? Will the fed convince people to spend despite masses dying!?? Despite all these people \"furloughed\"? Can the fed return the unemplyment rate to less than 8%?????????  \n\n\nIm no financial analyst, but all these indicators are not ingredients for a booming or thriving economy, especially none that should make stock values to exceed ATHs. I hope im wrong, but its really hard to pretend everythings ok right now.", "created_utc": 1593380006.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hhmxqu/lets_be_rational_autists_and_think_about_this/", "is_self": true}
