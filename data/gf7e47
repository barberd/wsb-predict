They have new cameras for video conferencing, new high quality gaming mouses that are cheap and affordable. Sales drastically increased in October and since the start of the Corona virus shutdown in March, sales have completely peaked. Everything is sold out. Quarter two earnings will be phenomenal and quarter one earnings on May 11 will beat expectations. Schools are shut down until the end of the year and a second corona wave will come meaning the demand for this tech stock will rise.\n2. LOGI releases a new product every 3-6 months based off their release notes.\n3. LOGI completed its initiated May 2017 share buyback program April 30 purchasing a total of 2,902,071 shares. They are announced that they are intending to enter a new share buyback program which is predicted to be released on or prior to earnings report.\n4. They have a healthy balance sheet boasting a total assets of 2,024,124 over total liabilities of 847,785.\n5. The volume for LOGI options is currently low. This means that there is a high bid ask spread currently but at low prices. If you buy in now the premiums will rise by next week.\n6. LOGI is at an all-time high and I believe it will continue to soar due to outstanding sales, factories opening up producing products therefore supply chain management issues are reduced, and the share buy back program they are announcing as guidance for the year.\n7. Pre-Corona the industry was booming and now everyone is at home it is continuing to MOON. Companies have given stipends to go out and buy LOGI equipment. They are a reputable brand name.\n8. Currently as of this post, the put call ratio is at a whopping 208:1 at mornings open.\n9. TECH stock: stocks only go up\n10. They have beat every single earnings that last two years and mooned every single time.\n11. RSI is at 65.28. not oversold or over bought. 70 and 30 are my two reference points.\n12. LOGI has broke resistance and continues to stay above it with no signs of dropping. It has hit 50 before last year and now it will surpass 50 easily and in June as well due to 2nd quarter earnings.\n13. This is not a financial crisis. People make more from unemployment or have more net positive income due to deferrals of car, phone, rent payments. LOGI is shown to be recession and corona proof.\n\nCons:\n\n1.
