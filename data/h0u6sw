In my Pueblo I'm known as El Wiki because I'm mother fucking Wikipedia. So fuck you Mods I'm El Pinched Wiki Lejano primo puto ass bitches \n\nI'm the fucking compa of my mother fucking Mexican community and I'm motivated to teach them good financial practices and knowledge based option risks for those that want to try their shot at it.\n\n\nBasically I'm saying to call your fucking shots on NET, PYPL, Facebook, and KSU. If you don't you're so fucking dumb on so many levels. Like I'm basically giving you money right now for free and you're not taking it? You are fucking stupid as FUCK for not doing that\n\n\nThese companies print fucking cash like no tomorrow at the fundamental level. Institutions put their money over here because they deal with actual real life shit like people's retirements and not your fucking little dickshit option. You can take advantage of this desperation for investor confidence.\n\n\n- call PayPal not Square. Square is for millenials who are all poor as fuck and for retarded Zoomers who are afraid to talk to people that hold responsibilities like bankers and tax filers. PayPal is what the rest of the world uses and scrapes discounts on Amazon transactions. PayPal is an actual business ran by business people. Not some retarded wannabe tech celebrity \n\n- call FB. This guy is like 12 years old and the world fucking hates him but still uses his product like coke addicted fuck boys across all age groups. Not only that, he is building a supermassive e-commerce platform so he will literally be rolling in hundreds of billions of dollars across India, Mexico, and the whole fucking world.\n\n- call KSU. USMCA goes into effect July 1st you lazy idiots. The heavy materials, energy, and industrials relationship between Texas and Monterrey will only continue to grow dramatically in the upcoming months. Yes Tesla, Ford, GM, and all your fucking little EV parts will be exchanged between Mexico and the US.\n\n- call NET. China can't build shit for themselves so they need Americans to come in and build their shit for real. This is why they fucking love Cloudflare filtered out web infrastructure to deal with their American Big Tech problem. Cloudflare lets them build some crazy shit out at scale. If you don't believe me then look at their relationship you stupid bitch\n\nIf you're a FUCKING \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b but Panasonic STOCKS because you're a fucking pussy but enjoy the battery and green tech tendies", "created_utc": 1591859224.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h0u6sw/can_i_post_dd_without_getting_filtered_yet_sigh/", "is_self": true}
