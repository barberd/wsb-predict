But I realized I can no longer be a lurking autist - I need to share with the rest of you \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b & \ud83d\udc02. \n\nMy day job, besides waking up at 6:30am to trade (gamble) like a denigrate, is to advise startups and larger companies on international growth and expansion strategies across Europe and Asia. Needless to say companies are doing less, m&a has been postponed, customers dropping off the map... something I haven\u2019t seen posted yet is venture money drying up. I\u2019ve heard from two clients last week alone they\u2019ve been told by the Andreessen Horowitzs and Sequoias that they won\u2019t be writing any checks for the rest of the year. That\u2019s FUCKING a lifetime for startups. No joke this couldn\u2019t come at a worse time, as many startups are trying to translation from being growth focused to profitable focus. \n\nYou can\u2019t simple flip a switch to become profitable, it takes time. It was already hard for series A and seed companies to raise last fall. It\u2019ll be impossible now for them and I\u2019d imagine the series B&Cs will struggle now too. Expect lots of startups to go out of business over the next year. It\u2019ll be a blood bath and that makes me think about all of the companies that service startups. It\u2019s gonna get rough for Silicon Valley Bank ($SIVB) for sure, but I\u2019d imagine depending on the failure rates you might see dents in AWS and Azure profits too. Where else could this spread? Idk I\u2019ll try to dig up more between gambling everything on SQ puts. \n\nPositions: Spy puts at whatever.
