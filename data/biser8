{"id": "biser8", "title": "MOMO easy buy this morning?", "selftext": "*decent revenue and user base growth\n\n*All panicky holders sold their shares today, about 600% the usual volume at just 11a.m.\n\n*Most US shareholders are worried about how MOMO is going to lose revenue due to government ban on its TanTan on some stores. The US news tells us that TanTan is being taken down due to government guidance. However, as a Chinese myself, if you read the Chinese news, TanTan is being take down due to its association with sexual materials. Basically, hookers and porn site promoters are using TanTan. Honestly, this is an easy fix. Chinese government is also not really strict about the whole sex industry. Yea, the consequences for prostitution are severe in China, but the Chinese police doesn't really put too much work at cracking this industry. This is just an act by the government for the citizens to watch. Similar things happened to many Chinese software such as mass account suspension in wechat due to prositution. The apps always bounce back.\n\nI don't know if I am allowed to post a link in this thread, I will post the news if you guys want. What do you guys think? Easy buy or nah?", "created_utc": 1556559991, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/biser8/momo_easy_buy_this_morning/", "is_self": true}
