Every minute of every trading day, not including AH.\n\nI think anyone who has done the same would agree with the following: this market's rallies are fake and gay. But I mean this in all seriousness. There is NOTHING organic about the action. The only exceptions to the consistent downward pressure are artificial. Some giant bursts sustained for up to 15 min, but more often, a tiny consistent trickle of buying just to keep the market from failing TOO fast. \n\n\nI am an amateur at best, don't understand anything about underlying market mechanics, an am retarded to boot. This is pure intuition.\n\n\nHere is the problem. The spending to do this is not tenable. When it runs out, we will organically plunge to < 200 and financial disaster.\n\n\nWhat's the one thing the US government can do to actallly STOP this? Halt short selling. Like some other shithole countries have. Like we used to.\n\n\nBanks and the powers that be will have advanced knowledge and benefit hugely of course. Retail bagholders watch their puts turn to dust.\n\n\nSell your puts today. At a minimum roll out to mid-April at EARLIEST. If everyone in the universe thinks the market is going to jump off a cliff on Monday, it's inevitable, right? Unless.......\n\n\n(Full disclosure: I am greedy and will probably not follow my own advice.)\n\nAnyone have any thoughts on this?", "created_utc": 1584110225.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fi0lmp/black_swan_squared_banned_short_sales/", "is_self": true}
