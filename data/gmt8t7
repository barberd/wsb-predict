I'll bold my \"gains\" as a humble brag to catch your attention, but I never post a picture.\n\nThe only reason it's a good time to buy it is because of some stupid fundamentals I'll outline below using bullets.\n\n* Stonks go up\n* Stonks go down\n* Stonks go sideways\n* Economy / Wife's BF joke\n* JPOW go BRRRRR\n* etc.\n\nSomething about how all of the above is enough reason to buy but wait...\n\nThere's more to show you about why this stock and position I'm in is a ~~pump and dump~~ strong buy!\n\n# One More Large Headline to Keep You Scrolling\n\nNow I'll include a chart where I mess with it to either have a really narrow date range or a really large X/Y axis to over-exaggerate whatever my point is and show you that you'll make money.\n\n[I'll even call out the trend for you in case you don't understand lines. It's going up.](https://preview.redd.it/v40xz86dbrz41.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=e95322ae2a439d67fa7c78914f06dc4a98bca656)\n\n**Position:** Here is where I would put my position. Not the actual position you should have taken last week, but my position so you can pump it before I sell it later today.\n\nNow I'll open up an invitation for anyone reading to call me out and then I'll angrily defend my position by hurling multiple insults and probably another joke about your wife's boyfriend, or maybe I'll use this to slip in a joke about your mom because she's fat.", "created_utc": 1589909871.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gmt8t7/anatomy_of_a_dd_template_ticker_going_updown_and/", "is_self": true}
