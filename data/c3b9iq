So what do I do next?", "selftext": "TL;DR Had a call credit spread opened, got assigned, now my account is up 1,100% and I'm sitting on my hands waiting to hear back from RH because I'm an idiot and don't know what I'm doing.\n\nAlright so here's where I'm at. I've been trading options for a few months now, and have recently started selling premium because it seems like a better way to make consistent profits. Two major issues with this. One, is I trade on Robinhood. Two, is I am now acquainted with ex-dividend date and what Robinhood does on said date. \n\nLast night I received an email from RH informing me that my 294 SPY calls had been assigned and my account is restricted. I go on to my account to see that my little 294 295 call credit spread I opened up yesterday is gone, and instead it's been replaced with 295 call buy orders, as well as $58k of unsettled funds.\n\nI go into full panic mode, as I don't have the cash to back it, and start frantically looking online for what tf is happening. Obviously this is the first place I come to, and low and behold u/no_sporks has a trending post titled [Assigned 10,000 SPY from Iron Condor](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c33u48/assigned_10000_spy_from_iron_condor/). I read through the comments and get an understanding for what happened.\n\nExcept there's one difference. My account is UP $58k, not down. So instead of exercising my buy option for me, the assigned my sell option. The only issue is that I didn't own SPY stock. now I have $58k of unsettled funds and a restricted account.\n\nMy best guess is that I got assigned my 294 calllast night, but since I didn't have the stocks to sell, they put money in my account to cover the cost of exercising my 295 call and all I'm going to lose is the difference.\n\nBut the markets are now open, I have over $60k in my account, 2 295 call buys, and no word from RH. I can't exersize the option as the only way to do it through RH is by contacting them, and I can't buy the stocks myself to cover the assignment as my account is restricted. So I'm just sitting on my hands waiting to see what happens.\n\nProof: https://imgur.com/a/iord7YW", "created_utc": 1561127420, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c3b9iq/im_an_idiot_so_what_do_i_do_next/", "is_self": true}
