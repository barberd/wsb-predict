Tell me why this is a stupid strat:\n\nEvery option I have ever bought on any stock or ETF has, at some point, gone in the green for me, even only slightly. This is because price is in fact modeled as a random variable with a probably of going up or down. What if I buy ATM call and put debit spreads that are 60days from expiry.  I then simply hold these positions for a week or so and it's almost guaranteed to make a few % gain on either side, and when each side goes green I sell (no matter how small the gain) \n\nOnce I get comfortable I increase my PRT buy just purchasing many of them to increase my tendie output.\n\nWhat do you think?", "created_utc": 1573094654, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dsr45d/a_sound_viable_options_strategy/", "is_self": true}
