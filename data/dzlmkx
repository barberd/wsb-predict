{"id": "dzlmkx", "title": "Contest Suggestion - December 2019", "selftext": "I was thinking we could do a contest for the month of December. Right now my idea is we each open up a RH account and fund the account for $200. Suggested rules of the contest:  \n1) You must provide screenshots of the initial funding of the account  \n2) You can trade what ever you would like (sell spreads, bag hold, FDs, etc...)  \n3) Each Friday, we must post our results via screenshots  \n4) Most profitable trader a the end of the month gets something (maybe we each agree to paypal the winner something like $5?) or we donate a portion of profits? (Looking for suggestions here).  \n  \nJust wanted to see everyones thoughs/suggestions and see how many people would be interested if we setup something like this.", "created_utc": 1574353152, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dzlmkx/contest_suggestion_december_2019/", "is_self": true}
