Apologies, but I'm too lazy to site shit.\n\n**I. The Death of Risk Parity Signals Inflation** \n\nSo the risk-party is trade has disappeared now that stocks and bonds are moving together. But wait, what the fuck does it even mean for the negative correlation to flip? I hypothesize this signals inflation.\n\nWhy? Well, let me teach you some history. The relationship between stocks and bonds has not always been this way. Here's the chart of bond yields vs stock going back to when the boomers were fucked into existence:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/irpl351nv9o41.png?width=632&format=png&auto=webp&s=968aba76ed6cf362d58d76a13235f0a93efb5716\n\nNotice, the current relationship between stocks and bonds harkens back to the 1980s right after a huge inflationary moment. Pre 1980s, policy was focused on reining in inflation. Since then, particularly since the market crashes of the 2000s, the mindset shifted from an inflationary one to a deflationary one.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/erucs24rw9o41.png?width=569&format=png&auto=webp&s=2427382fba830c32ce7076d22e392dcc8109b0c9\n\nIn a deflationary mindset, when stock prices go down, an asset manager worries about deflation, so he'll run to bonds. When stock prices go up, deflation is no longer feared, so the manager gets out of bonds. This is what we've been experiencing since the 80s.\n\nTransitioning to an inflationary environment, however, both asset classes track one another more closely. This will not happen overnight, likely over a few years, but we may be seeing the beginnings of a transition at this moment.\n\n**II. The Post Virus Era**\n\nI do not think we will have a v-shaped recovery. The post-virus world will differ wildly from what we knew. I imagine the differences may be somewhat akin to what we experienced post 9/11. Trump and his staff calling COVID the \"Chinese virus\" is a glimpse of the future. Going forward, expect\n\n* Trade restrictions\n* Travel restrictions\n* De-globalization\n* De-risking across industries\n* Increased costs throughout supply chains\n* Lower P/E multiples\n* Inflation\n\nBusiness will not be conducted as usual.\n\nWhile, yes, industries are on the brink of collapse, it's still somewhat bizarre that we still have such little buying. Given all the QE and promise of stimulus, surely some of the current prices make sense even if you account for three more months of lost revenue. Many companies are trading below their book values. Insiders are buying. What gives? I believe the market is aware that the future will look quite different.\n\n**III.  Why QE is doing Jack Shit**\n\nI believe one of the reason's price has not stabilized at all despite the assurances of free money is that the market does not believe the old prices will be realized: fair value will be far lower. This is not just in equity valuations though. This discrepancy has appeared in all of the corporate bond ETFs where the ETFs are trading at a 5% discount, and market makers don't seem interested in making markets at the current levels: they're still afraid they'll lose. Even though the fed has put up a trillion dollars (theoretically they could put up an infinite amount),  no one wants in--even with free money!--because the market hasn't believed we're at the bottom. The would never happen if we were anywhere near fair value. This is also why I believe we are currently so oversold and yet still have a bit more room to sell.\n\n**IV.  Hunting for Fair Value**\n\nInsider buying is worthwhile watching right now. There are some companies trading at absurdly low price to book valuations, and the executive know it. I'd recommend avoiding puts on any names with a lot of insider buying. You will get fucked out of the water, especially as these guys tell friends and family to buy. I got my ass handed to me on an SPG play because those fuckers started buying stock by the fist-full even through there P/E was still fairly high. Similarly, avoid puts on stocks that are trading below book value unless you're damn certain they're headed for bankruptcy.\n\nI would not buy puts next week unless you're completely autistic.\n\n\\---\n\nPositions:\n\n4/17p F, GM, GE, USO, INDA, EWW, EWZ, EEM, LUV, M\n\nYes, some of these are illiquid.
