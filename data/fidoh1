I haven't been doing this for that long and even I can clearly see that the only reason we shot up today, an insane 7% increase in the last 25 minutes, was because shorts were covering themselves before the weekend. Yeah the timing of trump's speech helped it clearly but if you think the bull markets is back then the gay bois are about to bend you over and show them what your girlfriend's been missing. \n\nThere's been one total day of panic, that's it, there's so much more to fall. We've only seen the market drop for the past three weeks and we've already entered a bear market, if we started going up right now that would be the shortest lived bear market ever, by a longshot. There will be up days (fucking obviously) but volatility is high rn that just means the down days will be even lower. \n\nIf you're a bull get out on monday before we see how low it can really go. If you really want to invest find stocks like KR or look for the next INO to play, don't be a fucking idiot.", "created_utc": 1584163995.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fidoh1/theres_only_one_reason_for_the_8_increase_today/", "is_self": true}
