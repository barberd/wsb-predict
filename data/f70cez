Motleyfool stock adviser releases stock picks 2 times per month, and when they release these picks, the suggested stock typically shoots up 5%  (and sometimes MUCH more) in the same day. They chose $DXCM today, which was $290 at time of release and hit $305 while finishing at $302. If you had done an OTM call for 5-10% out today, with $1,000, you could of easily made 20K or more. I was all set to do this, except the site had so much volume when the pick was released that I couldn't load it for 15 minutes straight, COSTING me tendies. Some of you mfers need to buy motleyfool stock adviser, and if  you're fortunate enough to see the pick at the exact time it is released, post it on here IMMEDIATELY, so we can all go BALLS DEEP in it..  I still closed out up 160% on $DXCM today, but it could of been so much more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGo on [https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html) and look at how much money you could of made on this play today.", "created_utc": 1582235087, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f70cez/missed_out_on_30k_today/", "is_self": true}
