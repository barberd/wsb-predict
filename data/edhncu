But they actually didn\u2019t cover it (it showed pending). I opted for margin by accepting RH Gold and they gave back my long put 2 full trading days after they originally said it was exercised. Why didn't they just exercise it, rather than giving it back. It could\u2019ve  been exercised it at a better price and acted on. btw expirary was today and I couldn\u2019t act on it until open this morning.
