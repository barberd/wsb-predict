Right about now they're worth around 1.10. Between a month ago and now, the IV stayed between 25-30%, at least according to TOS and robinhood.\n\nSo, question is: if the premium for OTM options is based on time value + IV, what else causes the boost in premium when IV hasn't really changed much during this time?", "created_utc": 1576347619, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ean6k8/option_pricing_and_iv_tsm_for_example/", "is_self": true}
