{"id": "f2dzly", "title": "The MSFT Post", "selftext": "* FAAAM stands for Facebook, Amazon, Google, Apple, Microsoft\n* The HSR act is a law about mergers that has a loophole in it because government is great.\n   * if the total value that the buying company pays is less than 70 Million\\*, *no one has to know about the merger*.  Literally, then don't have to file anything with the government.\n   * \\* that 70 Million has gone up throughout the years.  As of 2018 its up to 85 Mil.\n* FTC announced today that they will be investigating FAAAM in regards to HSR going back to 2010.\n* The investigation will focus on \"deals of companies that could have potentially developed into larger businesses, and moves by tech giants that increased their influence in adjacent markets.\"\n* In plane English:  The FTC is worried that during the last decade, FAAAM used HSR to squash competition before it could arise and take over the world.  A easy example of expansion: Amazon buying a bunch of small manufacturing companies so they suddenly have the infrastructure to produce Amazon Basics, products designed to compete with everyday needs.  An example of competition: Facebook buying a small social media company worth 50 Mil that could have easily grown into an Instagram competitor.\n* The FAAAM are tanking today because everyone savy enough to have watched and understood the Social Network already knows this is true and this investigation will turn over some dirty laundry.  For Christ's sake, [John Oliver had this shit down in 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00wQYmvfhn4).\n* But if you stop panicking and take a breath you'll realize that when you think about it, Its all Amazon Facebook and Google that have done this.  Companies that surged to stardom in the last decade, a time when their potential was not yet understood.\n* Microsoft dealt with this shit 20 years ago and back then the big case against them was:\n\n&gt;\" bundling of a so-called \u201czero-price offering\u201d (Internet Explorer) with a dominant platform (Windows) \u201cdistorted markets by robbing consumers of a real choice between technology services (i.e., other browsers) and stifled innovation,\u201d \n\n* In other words, Microsoft is going to walk away from this laughing.  The MEME status of internet explore compared to 3rd party browsers like Chrome and Firefox is proof positive that MSFT has been respecting the rules when they dealt with this shit 20 years ago.\n* I guarantee that as soon as it becomes clear that this investigation is focused mostly on Google, Amazon and FB, MSFT will get back on track.", "created_utc": 1581451254, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f2dzly/the_msft_post/", "is_self": true}
