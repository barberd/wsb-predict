I see a lot of potential here.\n\n> The price of the S&P500 is going to be a big fuck you tomorrow.  Fuck everything you know about printers. Fuck your chemical plants. Fuck your corn for ethanol. Your low-density ozone layer is actually a mechanical restriction on gravity that was damaged by this massive solar flare you sent our way and its not going to be fixed.  You all understand all the issues there, but the problem isn't how many people have a job.  Fuck them.  Fuck factories.  Fuck companies.  Fuck backseats. Fuck the man upstairs.  Fuck your significant others, your parents, your friends and the people who invested all of this money and to whom you are paying in interest and rental payments.  Fuck all of those people.\n\n[Source website](https://talktotransformer.com/)", "created_utc": 1592409655.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hau0bu/i_read_that_bloomberg_and_forbes_use_automated/", "is_self": true}
