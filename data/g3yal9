DD inside.", "selftext": "since everything is now on liquidity, I suggest following unusually activity for options because anyone that is going to sell, is going to sell heavily to avoid missing out on the price when they trigger a massive sell-off. What does this mean? huge shorts are in for this week, and I expect huge EOD short positions this week to keep an eye on. when someone is going to sell heavy, they are going to hedge with a shit ton of puts to capitalize on that sell of, and when someone is going to short heavy, they are going to sell as soon as possible to take advantage of the best price they can get. If you want money, the next 3 weeks are where it is at, either you are going to short, or you are going to time the bottoms. either-or, stay safe, cash position is a position, remember this.\nEDIT: forgot to say, positions spy 280 4/24, 200, 09/18, tsla calls (because of autism)", "created_utc": 1587256237.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g3yal9/this_week_is_about_to_be_insane_subscriptions_vs/", "is_self": true}
