Those are all banned at the moment. They're trying to tread water by hosting Harry Styles (gay) and One Direction (gay) for FREE concerts. Nobody is fucking attending those. All the hottest \"virtual concerts\" are free on fucking YouTube. Eventbrite is currently trying to compete *with YouTube*.\n\nWebsite: [https://www.eventbrite.com/trending/searches/online/](https://www.eventbrite.com/trending/searches/online/)\n\n1Direction \"Concert\": [https://www.eventbrite.com/e/one-direction-four-album-tickets-104529558724?aff=ebdssbonlinesearch](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/one-direction-four-album-tickets-104529558724?aff=ebdssbonlinesearch)\n\nDD on \"trending searches\": [https://i.imgur.com/tMUy8Wu.png](https://i.imgur.com/tMUy8Wu.png)\n\nTop concerts all on YouTube: [https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/9335531/coronavirus-quarantine-music-events-online-streams](https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/9335531/coronavirus-quarantine-music-events-online-streams)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey've had a long and tried history of failure. They IPO'd at \\~$34 and have just eaten since then. Their 2018 annual revenue was <$300 million and their current market cap is fucking \\~$850 million at their current share price.\n\nShitty Revenue: [https://i.imgur.com/aTdSAVI.png](https://i.imgur.com/aTdSAVI.png)\n\n$EB Since IPO: [https://i.imgur.com/LXzPvV8.png](https://i.imgur.com/LXzPvV8.png)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey froze hiring, of course. Laying people off, too. Half their workforce.\n\nFroze hiring: [https://www.eventbritecareers.com/home](https://www.eventbritecareers.com/home)\n\nLay-offs: [https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Mass-layoffs-at-Yelp-Eventbrite-show-15190391.php](https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Mass-layoffs-at-Yelp-Eventbrite-show-15190391.php)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLook this is a dying company with no future. If things were \"normal\", they'd still be dying with no future. Everything on their website is free AND it all SUCKS. They're paying out the ass to get these musicians to come perform for them relying on what? Ad revenue?
