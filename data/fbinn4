I hope this will help all the \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b sleep soundly over the weekend and spend time with their loved ones.\n\n**Full Disclosure, I have 50K of Puts on Airlines and Expedia.**\n\nIf market opens up green on Monday, be sure to hold, things will get better (for your puts of course). West Coast (CA/Oregon/Washington) are all getting hit. State officials are coming forward with known cases. **Canada, Sweden, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Lebanon, Finland, Germany** also got confirmed cases over night.\n\n1ST US Death, additional travel bans.\n\nI dropped my mom off at JFK NYC and airport was so empty and 0 traffic, travel is definitely getting hit.\n\nThe possible outcomes on Monday are as follows:\n\n1. Market opens green, and recovers fully stonks only go up. You will lose all your portfolio, but your loved ones will be healthy and you will live a good life and continue to make salary.\n2. Market opens green, you hold and crashes over the next 6 months, you will be financially fine as markets continue to tumble but risk unemployment.\n3. Market opens red, you make bank, roll that into deeper OTM puts and will be financially prepared to when your job starts laying off employees.\n\nBuying puts is in a way like buying insurance on the future of your livelihood, don't feel sad if you lose all your money.\n\nThat being said, things are looking good for us bears!\n\n* China PMI lowest of all time - large companies are not getting products and smaller businesses are not getting smaller made in china items:  \n\n   * [https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/02/28/business/bc-virus-outbreak-china-manufacturing-slump.html](https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/02/28/business/bc-virus-outbreak-china-manufacturing-slump.html)\n* Washington got cases and state officials are being transparent:  \n\n   * [https://komonews.com/news/local/two-new-cases-of-coronavirus-including-student-in-snohomish-county](https://komonews.com/news/local/two-new-cases-of-coronavirus-including-student-in-snohomish-county)\n* Oregon Case:  \n\n   * [https://katu.com/news/local/watch-live-6-pm-oregon-officials-announce-first-presumptive-case-of-novel-coronavirus](https://katu.com/news/local/watch-live-6-pm-oregon-officials-announce-first-presumptive-case-of-novel-coronavirus)\n* NYC Case - Imagine all the NYC workers on the same flight as these individual who are ill. Trump also said that he is considering further travel restrictions in a press conference in this video.  \n\n   * [https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/coronavirus/nj-connecticut-prepared-to-start-covid-19-testing-as-nyc-awaits-results-on-resident/2306912/](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/coronavirus/nj-connecticut-prepared-to-start-covid-19-testing-as-nyc-awaits-results-on-resident/2306912/)\n\nOnce its confirmed in NYC, it will start spreading like wildfire. China basically gave up and quarantined Wuhan at this time and everyone is staying indoors. This would be unconstitutional and probably not be able to do the same in the US.\n\nAnecdotal from NYC:\n\nI just ate Soup Dumplings in Flushing, Queens (Asian Community in NYC). All stores and restaurants are near empty and everyone is wearing face masks.\n\nAte dinner and legit felt like I contracted something. Normally not a hypochondriac but feel like I may be getting sick.\n\nIt's in NYC, 100% for sure.\n\nI don't believe for that there are 0 cases in NYC. Flights from China and Korea are coming through with no issues (customs are only doing a temperature check). My cousin just came in from Qing Dao -&gt; Beijing -&gt; JFK, with minimum resistance.\n\nCan't believe he got through so easily, he's not even a US citizen, only a green card holder.\n\nAdditionally, fashion week just ended and thousands of employees that work on fashion Ave (7th) just got back from Milan, Italy. It's spreading like wildfire there and they were all shaking hands and kissing cheeks at huge parties for a whole week.\n\nMy co worker came back from China. We just quarantine her at home for 2 weeks before can start working. The Government is definitely lying about the whole quarantine process.\n\nStay Woke on Covid-19: [https://www.reddit.com/live/14d816ty1ylvo/](https://www.reddit.com/live/14d816ty1ylvo/)Closing Statement:\n\n***Buy Hand Sanitizer, Face mask, Rice, Spam, and all other non perishable food and be prepared to stay indoors.
