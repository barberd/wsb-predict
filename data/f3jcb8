Quite a few tests which will be done in quick succession and nothing can go wrong there or we going to hurt.  This will hopefully get some syndication from the normies who are all impressed with the word space and commercial. \n\nNot yet convinced how much this will move the stock immediately with the tremendous run-up we have had in recent days -- but it could.
