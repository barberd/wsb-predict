I've been building a design for a platform that would make sharing shit like our positions gains/losses and all that in a way that doesn't suck and allow for better sharing of news/tips/etc (and make money cause normies should be paying us for voluntarily becoming autistic to make big tendies and being lurking micemen).  \n\nStockTwits would be closest to it but really a completely different end product from what this would be. \n\nJust throwing this out there in case any of y'all interested in discussing.  I am going to build it myself regardless in my free time... and plan to do it full time even should I hit a goal in my portfolio.  \n\nShoot me a DM!  Will be cool to REALLY see some of these autists stats... instead of \"look at my loss\" we could see exactly what they did and what caused it... much more fun when posting here :-P \n\nMods - it is largely being designed around the way the community works here.  Would love to work with y'all as it comes together to do some direct integration into this subreddit as well.\n\nFor you non engineers -- what would a fun name be for an autist social trade/position sharing, DD platform? :-)", "created_utc": 1581646278, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3l5h4/any_autist_software_engineers_here/", "is_self": true}
