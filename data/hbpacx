{"id": "hbpacx", "title": "You won\u2019t believe what this millennial retard does next with his money! And other DD inside.", "selftext": "So I\u2019m currently all-in on SPY 3/30 $330c. [https://imgur.com/a/IY6ZLqO](https://imgur.com/a/IY6ZLqO). V-recovery talks going well so I\u2019m feeling fine.\n\nI had been just a short time ago at $40k. [https://imgur.com/a/zKh73ja](https://imgur.com/a/zKh73ja).\n\nMy mistakes were many. Can be summarized as being a massive pussy and paper-handing everything in sight when they all would have printed eventually.\n\nNow that Trump has confirmed our entry to the Super V (or V+) market, I am looking towards longer term plays once my calls print their dicks off next week and I\u2019m back to 25k+ (actual figure may vary +-1000%).\n\nHere\u2019s some simple DD for you guys that may be like me and feeling actually retarded but still not resigned to join theta gang quite yet:\n\nSIX  \nSix Flags has multiple parks re-opening June 22nd. There is still no word on NJ or CA parks, their largest by far. But if you have been in the trading game a bit, you\u2019ll know that this ticker can and has been manipulated wildly. They are currently trading at $23, down a full 50% from pre-covid. This pony will be getting back on the trail shortly, and I intend to make sure it\u2019s got one more miniature retard packed on for the ride.\n\nI\u2019m suggesting a calendar spread in order to not yield so much of your $$$ to the fuckers of Theta Gang, as you may have to ride this one out. Sell 7/17 $30 and buy 9/18 $30. For the noobs out there, this is a net debit transaction so no margin required. You are still a long-dick, don\u2019t worry.\n\nRTX  \nNot much to say as I consider it obvious. Down 35% still from pre-COVID and IV on calls is low. They are a big government player so they will get back any down production. I recommend going long either Aug or September as this one may pick up quickly. Suggested strike $80.\n\nBANKING  \nObviously a key sector that still hasn\u2019t recovered. With the Fed extending 0% rates infinitely I don\u2019t expect them to rocket tomorrow. I recommend calendar spreads again. I\u2019m going for WFC 7/17 and October probably $40.\n\nAZN  \nAstraZeneca is already hyped around and most of the DD is gay. Yes they are already producing an untested vaccine and yes that\u2019s priced in. Yes it\u2019s for no profit. Yes in reality that will probably not be the case. However you should know that they have a sleeper revenue booster in the wings, cancer drug Tagrisso which produces nearly 1b quarterly right now and is still not fully approved. Recent testing results were released and a potential 80% success rate as discussed. This bitch is $15k per bottle of 30 pills and patients take it for 2-3 years. Currently about 30k people use it and I found at least one source that state another 60k in the wings to take it soon.\n\nThis is a major earnings booster and their next quarterly call is 7/31.\n\nI recommend 7/17 $60 and Oct $60 calendar spread so you can rape someone else for theta on the $60 call leading to earnings and then profit bigly.\n\n\nWARNING - LOW CAP STONKS PLAY BELOW\n\nPLSE  \nLots to say about the history here, to make it short they have had a hard time getting FDA approval on a skin cancer treatment called CellFX. Back in Feb of 2020 they were rejected and the stock fell from $18 to $8. It looked like a year long period of more testing. Then in April, it was reported that there was agreement with the FDA on a shorter route with data points to come in June.\n\nIt is now June and as of June 15th, board chairman Duggan (Forbes 400 guy who sold prior biotech for 25b) has added $17m for 2.5m shares. This is a key signal and I recommend those that hold shares to get a piece now before this runs back up to its proper market cap of 1b ($30 share value approx). Duggan has stated he has a massive stake in this company and he intends to \u201csee it through to a finish\u201d.\n\n\nHEDGES  \nJust get a few VIX calls and don\u2019t be retarded and go un-hedged.\n\nAgain these are just suggestions from someone who\u2019s just as frustrated with their retardation as the next autist.\n\nTL;DR\n\nSIX, RTX, WFC, AZN go long get calls maybe calendar spreads. Hedge with VIX calls. Check out PLSE for long holdings.\n\n\n\nPositions: SPY 73x 6/30 $330c", "created_utc": 1592522160.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hbpacx/you_wont_believe_what_this_millennial_retard_does/", "is_self": true}
