Welcome to the new trading week and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market movers and news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[Today's Top Headlines for Monday, March 30th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/30/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-30-2020.html)\n\n*****\n\n> * U.S. stock futures were pointing to a modest decline for the Dow Jones Industrial Average at Monday\u2019s open after President Donald Trump extended national social distancing guidelines to April 30. The Dow, which closed 4% lower Friday, did soar 12.8% for the week, logging its best weekly gain since 1938 and raising questions about whether blue chips have bottomed. However, heading into Monday\u2019s session, the Dow was still nearly 27% off last month\u2019s record highs. The yield on the 10-year Treasury remained below 1% early Monday. U.S. oil prices sank below $20 per barrel, near 18-year lows hit earlier this month.\n\n*****\n\n> * On Sunday, mortgage bankers warned that Federal Reserve mortgage purchases are unbalancing the home lending market. In addition to the Fed\u2019s extraordinary no limit fixed-income purchases, Wall Street analysts and economists said it would not be out of the question to see the central bank take for the first time ever a passive interest in the performance of the stock market.\n\n*****\n\n> * Preparing the nation for a death toll that could exceed 100,000 from the coronavirus, Trump on Sunday walked back his previous remarks about wanting to reopen the country for business by Easter. In continuing social distancing until the end of next month, the president said, \u201cNothing would be worse than declaring victory before the victory has been won.\u201d Earlier on Sunday, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said the country could see up to 200,000 deaths and millions of infections. However, he also cautioned that those numbers are based on outbreak modeling and nothing is certain.\n\n*****\n\n> * The U.S., which has the most known coronavirus infections in the world, saw confirmed cases jump to over 143,000 with 2,513 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. New York has about 40% of those cases and fatalities. A field hospital has been set up inside New York\u2019s Central Park to treat coronavirus patients. Abbott Laboratories, which received FDA emergency use authorization on Friday for a test that can detect coronavirus in 5 minutes, was praised by Trump. \u201cAbbott has stated that they will begin delivering 50,000 tests each day, starting this week,\u201d he said. Abbott shares were soaring about 8% in the premarket.\n\n*****\n\n> * Global coronavirus cases increased to over 730,000 with 34,685 deaths and more than 149,000 recoveries. Italy, No. 2 to the U.S. in cases with about 97,700, has the worst death toll. Italy\u2019s 10,779 fatalities are more than three times as many as China\u2019s 3,308 deaths. Rounding out the top three, Spain just surpassed China in infections, with over 85,000 cases and more than double China\u2019s death toll at 6,803. China, where the pandemic started in December, has the world\u2019s fourth most known infections, nearing 82,200 cases. Germany is No. 5 in worldwide cases at about 62,400. It has 541 deaths.\n\n*****\n\n> * Amazon warehouse workers in Staten Island, one of the five boroughs of New York City, plan to strike on Monday to call attention to what they claim is the lack of protections for employees. Chris Smalls, a management assistant and a lead organizer of the strike, told CNBC that workers at the fulfillment center known as JFK8, have grown increasingly concerned about coming into work after an employee tested positive for the coronavirus there last week. Amazon told CNBC that the company was supporting the individual in quarantine and asked anyone who was in contact with the worker to stay home with pay for two weeks. JFK8 remains open.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/pzD22Kh.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/EsF6mmi.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/mce1VeY.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/5rLsTWv.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/vOVEFHa.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*($RH $BB $VFF $CHWY $KMX $WBA $PAYS $TTNP $STZ $CALM $GNLN $CSU $CAG $MKC $RMBL $GPL $HEXO $PVH $DARE $CTEK $CYD $NVCN $LW $AYI $ICLK $ALPN $APOG $UNF $EAST $SMTS $CSSE $SCHN $LNDC $NG $RECN $EDAP $APTX $ASND $VRNT $MOTS $VERO)*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/InmHVgs.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*($GRWG $GNLN $RMBL $CALM $CTEK $CYD)*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Sm5LctR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ho9EpoV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/hrNOYzf.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/q0iWKbS.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/pnJXRXy.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/9T9bEYz.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/qMxQyex.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/r6VRiZb.pngg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/BD1YIpS.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/TfbQnba.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/EysvYE9.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/ycEzL4P.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/uwjtT4d.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #6!](https://i.imgur.com/RPQKKYw.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #7!](https://i.imgur.com/G4gNNJx.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS:\n\n* ABT\n* AXSM\n* JNJ\n* NVDA\n* CALM\n* BK\n* CAKE\n* CVNA\n* APD\n* UBS\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/30/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-jj-sanofi-regeneron-la-z-boy-apple-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)** \u2013 The company announced it has identified a lead COVID-19 vaccine candidate, and plans to begin phase 1 clinical trials by September at the latest.
