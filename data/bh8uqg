{"id": "bh8uqg", "title": "Technical Analysis and Stock Picks [April 25, 2019]", "selftext": "I didn't expect this but I feel like I learned a lot from writing up everything (not everything). Also, I'm not exactly sure how I want to format these yet or how often I'm going to update them, but I'll figure it out eventually.\n\nI actually meant to post this last night, but I wasn't finished so I got up an wrote the rest this morning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm definitely going to need to put this disclaimer for the rest of eternity so that I don't get murdered by angry internet gamblers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"**Don't do anything based on what I say. I'm serious. Please Don't.**\n\nThis  only exists because I can't find a decent trading journal. Especially  one that would remind me to check whether or not I was right. I plan on  developing the application (unless one of you guys want to do it, Not  like I give a fuck.) after I finish up my finals and stuff. This is a  pretty decent replacement in the meantime.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso here's something interesting I've known about for a while but i think writing it out can put it in perspective. If you can hold an option longer (without being a dumbass bag-holder) you stand to make significantly more than you do if you buy FDs all fucking day. Crazy advice for gamblers but hey, chase the win or some bullshit like that.\n\nBasically, you can buy some options that have a further expiration- if you can manage to get them for cheap on whatever trend you've decided on, and over time you can reap those sweet %s that you morons jump for intraday.\n\nI've watched options move hundreds of percentages over a longer trend- even if it's wrong sometimes. But it doesn't do that for FDs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's also advice that I'd taken from several books, which is to not jump on to a moving train. For a proper trade, you want to be ready before the stock explodes- and sure, you can't predict that, but that's not your job. Your job is to figure out what the market is telling you, and reacting appropriately. Or maybe your job is to blow all of your wife's vacation money. I don't judge.\n\nOkay, I'm done being a wet blanket.\n\n# Let's recap:\n\nSo firstly, today was an absolute clusterfuck. Tesla (TSLA) missed eps by 336% and is so far not reacting. Boeing (BA) weeklies moved 100% twice during and then down following their investors call. And Facebook (FB) broke out like a motherfucker AH. And Amazon dropped down all day, and then mostly recovered AH.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Okay, another thing. I'm sure I don't have to explain that I'm not necessarily predicting the next day's behaviour rather the trend of the market for a particular amount of time.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay, so I'll go through some of yesterdays callouts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SPY**\n\nSo this is kind of what I expected.\n\n&gt;The lack of consolidation and the fact that the RSI has crossed into  overbought (keep in mind, stocks and ETFs are capable of continuing  above 70% for a while- but we usually see a pullback. So its possible to  expect that tomorrow.\n\nI also said:\n\n&gt;This isn't any particular pattern as far as I am aware, but I've  definitely seen this happen a few times with stocks before and it acts  as an ascending wedge. **It could fall back.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/vs2kr0t70fu21.png\n\nAnd as a result, we saw the RSI begin to comeback down and may continue til its made distance from the overbought territory. Whether this is a pullback or a reversal, I can't say. But at least as of right now, I'm doubtful this is a reversal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe same applies to **Amazon** but also for a completely different reason:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/9r0tyk290fu21.png\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThough Amazon didn't react this way correlative to SPY, it has been known to be influenced on the downside of its movements.\n\nThe reason is because they fully withdrew from china.\n\nThat said, I could still see AMZN going up to 2000.\n\nBut tbh its pretty easy to trade Amazon. If it picks a direction. Boom go in that direction. Easy money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Apple (AAPL)** also did the same thing, but this time it was correlative.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/tzti2uca0fu21.png\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was hella reactive, but correlative. I'm still sure that the stock will try to climb back, but that also depends on whether the market will maintain the ATH trading range.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay, on to the new stuff.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CATERPILLAR (CAT):**\n\nSo this bastard is sporting either an ascending wedge or a triangle (probably a triangle).\n\nThey're down yesterday because of their earnings, though they beat EPS: ( 2.94 vs 2.84 exp).\n\nYou can probably ride this stock up a bit longer, before you get an actually good upward jump, if it does end up being a wedge (which it might be based on the highs)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/v0cpt15c0fu21.png\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Facebook (FB):**\n\nSo yesterday in the afterhours as most of you know, Facebook shot up about 15 dollars. And it's actually filling a gap that it had made back last July. I'm pretty sure most of it has been covered in the afterhours, but gapping can sometimes take away any legs it has. The grey area is the gap.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/ta7mz88d0fu21.png\n\nFundamentally there's alot about facebook that  we can talk about but I dont wanna. Moving on\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**AMD**:\n\nI'm pissed about AMD because I had it front of my face all day yesterday and instead I trading Boeing. Anyway, it's now trading around $28.46. There's a bit of resistance around here thats being kinda rejected on the hourly. Youll probably find a good move here if you can get a larger volume pick up.\n\nBut, I think this may be forming a cup and handle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/y2soudce0fu21.png\n\nIt hasnt really gotten to the handle part so who knows, but if it holds this area at all I could see it wedging down and then breaking out.\n\nIf it breaks 30 with solid volume, then you may have a good long play.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ROKU: Sideways (?)**\n\nKinda the same thing. Its got a cup and handle-ish thing going on- but thats more on the hourly chart. On the weekly and daily you have a wedge thing going on. Either way, it'll probably shoot up at one point soon. Or not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/6nuv2fbg0fu21.png\n\n# Final Notes:\n\nI haven't elaborated on any of the technical indicators because there's no point unless there's price action to confirm it. Remember that indicators are lagging, so by the time you find out, it may have already happened- that type of bullshit. Also volume. Volume is important. You're gonna be making shitty breakouts if the volume is below average, so watch that as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not really getting to much into the volatility of the options or the stock right now because I'm just calling plays based on set up and writing this shit down takes forever. Writing the fundamentals and all that other shit will take a lot longer.\n\nIll get that shit figured out, though.", "created_utc": 1556200167, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bh8uqg/technical_analysis_and_stock_picks_april_25_2019/", "is_self": true}
