{"id": "ewtwkh", "title": "APT Calls = Free Money?", "selftext": "I've been trading APT a lot the past 2 weeks and I think its gearing up for a huge spike.\n\nCoronavirus cases are now popping up in the US. First NYC case reported a couple of hours ago and there are reports saying that NYC is already selling out of masks. I believe with the 10-14 incubation period we are going to see a lot more cases popping up and we are going to see the biggest demand spike in the history of any US mask company.\n\nAPT a real company with no debt, solid cash and low option premium, not one of these speculative fluff companies. Try calling their customer service number: (800) 749-1363, and talk to a rep. They are operating 24/7 and cranking out masks as fast as they can.\n\nAnd before everyone starts saying \"iTs uP X% iN ThE lAsT WeEk AnD yoU buY noW??\" I've already heard this many times over the past two weeks and I've bought the dip and profited each time. There are going to be a lot more cases popping up in the US imo.\n\nThoughts?", "created_utc": 1580500500, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ewtwkh/apt_calls_free_money/", "is_self": true}
