My task today is to paint the true story of TTD.\n\nEarnings will kill TTD like your dad permanently killed your libido by bragging about your mom blowing his candle out on his birthday.\n\nTTD has a $100,000/mo minimum banner ad spend requirement to onboard with them. That means only heavy hitter digital advertisers can work with them. Big brand retailers, auto dealer networks, consumer brands, and big dick-swingin e-commerce. \n\nThe ad industry dirty secret is there is not any functional attribution for banner advertising. Nobody really knows if it works or not. Over the last year, because of privacy initiatives, it's become impossible to connect an ad impression to a purchase. Everyone kind of assumes display ads work and goes along, but it's nearly impossible to prove with any kind of specificity. \n\n[Uber learned this the hard way when they turned off millions in spend and saw that it made zero difference in app installs.] (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xr2jZLM1T8PGsqVHJr9kY6U-6kl7EjlZ/view)\n\nNot *really* knowing if it works, and being a very liquid operational expense. CTO's can't justify it while cutting heads. That means it's the first thing to be cut and the last bill to be paid. \n\nTo make matters worse, TTD is a middleman between the advertisers and the publishers. They are the bag holders when advertisers don't/can't/won't pay.\n\nIf only there was some way to track companies that are completely dumping TTD.... Oh, wait. They use a proprietary javascript pixel and the pixel can be mapped across websites by companies like [builtwith.com](https://trends.builtwith.com/ads/The-Trade-Desk)\n\n[Crayons](https://www.screencast.com/t/9IBBuWHn) This shows the websites that are dropping them like your wife's boyfriend keeps dropping the remote between the cushions. It doesn't show all the websites that are cutting spend to the bone or pausing. The drop on this chart just represents the sites that have removed the javascript / ended their contract completely.\n\nAnalysts are starting to call bullshit. Here is a good piece on the [coming apocalypse and why consensus numbers are bullshit from Mule](https://mule.substack.com/p/quantifying-the-adpocalypse) \n\nOMC, FB, and WPP are all going to report earnings in the next two weeks. At that point the blood bath that advertising is taking will be clear. \n\nTL;DR: TTD, you killed my father. Now, you must die. \n\nSrsly, GTFO with your P/E of 99 on old earnings. \n\nTTD 130p 4/17 - huge pile of sads\n\nTTD 150p 5/15 - will see joy\n\nWPP 25p  4/17 - lump of sads\n\nWPP 22.5p 5/15 - down with MADMEN", "created_utc": 1586824563.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0vbuq/ttd_killed_inigo_montoyas_father/", "is_self": true}
