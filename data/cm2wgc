After his second DUI, he had to spend 30 days in jail.  I was 13 at the time.  When he got out and I asked what happen, this is what he told me:\n\nMy uncle went to the bar he regularly visits and got super drunk with all the other regulars (who are also drunks).  He acknowledged that he normally gets super drunk but he usually gets by unscathed.  He didn't get by the time because there was an altercation.\n\nIt was about 1:30 AM and he wanted to drive home.  But when he got in his car, he realized that someone had stolen something:  the dashboard.  Who the fuck steals a dashboard?  He figured those asshole in the bar had pulled one over on him so he went back into the bar, started yelling, started making accusations and eventually smashed some stuff.  The bar called the cops because he was out of control but he didn't really realize because he was so drunk.\n\nAfter that, he decided to go sleep in his car.  When he got back into his car, the dashboard was back!  Apparently, the first time he got into the car that night, he was sitting in the back seat and was too drunk to realize.  He went to drive home (now that the dash board was back), the cops got him on his way home and he went to jail.\n\nI had a really good line to sum this whole story up and tie it into investing but I can't remember it now.  But I already wrote this so you tell me how it applies to the stock market because I'm positive that it does.\n\nBuy TSLA.", "created_utc": 1564959488, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cm2wgc/let_me_tell_you_a_story_my_uncle_told_me_which/", "is_self": true}
