Alladin. Toy Story 4. The Lion King. Star Wars 9. i mean come on seriously holy shit. that being said it will honestly probably go down because i jinxed it and also because it's fuckign up 20%+ on the week or whatever and that shit never happens. tbh i don't know why it took so long for this to go up. but i think i put too much weight on how well the movie division does and how that probably doesn't really help their financials. but what do i know i thought that the disney logo said disnep until i was like 17 lmao\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRoku - ROKU \\[bear\\] $65.02: how the hell is this thing worth $65, this thing is literally jsut a streaming stick or box right?? lmaooo how is this thing still alive. this shit moves so much too on a daily basis this is litreally a glorified penny stock that is way overvalued. also i watched a video about how streaming is going to probably die because it's literally becoming what it was meant to replace. too many people company etc trying to make their own streaming to the point no one will want to pay for all this shit. we paid for netflix becuase it was the cream of the crop and had a lot of stuff. not because of its originals. but now the streaming market has changed and is oversatured and will it even exist? anyways enough of my crying i'm just amazed how this thing is worth a PS4/xbox game because it's a fucking stick; it's a glorified chromecast hahahahahah. how is this company thriving hahahahaha \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWendy's Company - WEN \\[bear\\] $18.43: it pains me to say i think this will go down as their new cookie crumble frostys are absolutely fantastic. i had it three straight days the past week and its really good. but so sad it's at all time highs or near it so i think this may fall down unless sales are orgasmic. but let's be honest this is fast food. i don't see it growing too many vegans nowadays with their non-gluten having asses. muah\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDropbox - DBX \\[super bear\\]: $24.42: i'm so mad at this company. i won't be vulgar but i had to install it on my new iPad the other day and their 3 devices linked only for free accounts is absolute scam. wow. whyy the heck can i only put 3 devices connected to my dropbox... but thinking about this it also means they make more revenue if the users end up forking the money. that being said i am not forking the damn money because there is so much more other storage clouds so eat my pubic hair dbx! will probably go up tho \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAMC Entertainment Holdings - AMC \\[bull\\]: $14.59: ugh i'm crying i just read a stupid article from stupid motley that a list may be going after sinemia did. anyways i love amc and i always will and i thin ka list is amazing. it is definitely not should not be aroudn $15 and it's around its lows so i think it will go up. i really hope it goes up. ugh. ok update i just read the stupid article from motley and so no amc is fine. the concessions they make from people always watching movies like myself should carry them up as it is 100% their revenue that they don't have to share. it's going tits up baby (again probably not)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurtle Beach Corporation - HEAR \\[bear\\]: $11.17: hear and bear rhyme. also this thing is down 60% since like august '18. there is no hope for this. again expect it to probably go up since it is so low but trust it'll go straight back down. or not because again i am retarded. side note, i have used their devices and honestly they're okay but i just don't like over the ear headphones because they make me sweat profusely. not sure why but maybe because thery'e like shaped like fucking winterr mitten ear things. what do you call those things? they're like mittens but for youyr ears. ear mittens right? yeah headphones like these i can't really use because i sweat too much. anyways so yeah this company is an alirght company but it's very niche and their products aren't going to make you cum any better than any other headphones imo so bear bear bear rawr\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni'm 6-4 so far so let's hope i go 16-4 hahahahaahahahah. can u guys believe i typed rawr\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n i want to douse my self in gas and light it up with elon's sexy falmethrower machine gun\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nenjoi bois", "created_utc": 1557124992, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bl8m1l/i_pick_stocks_so_that_you_have_to_week_beg_5619/", "is_self": true}
