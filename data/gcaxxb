{"id": "gcaxxb", "title": "Airline stock strategy. I would like to hear your thoughts", "selftext": "Major airlines are going for 1/3 of that they were usually going for. UAL is going for $26.00 a share when it was going for $75 just a few months ago.\n\nLet's say I have $30,000 to invest. I put $10,000 into 3 different airlines:\n\n10k in UAL, 10k in LUV, 10k in Delta.\n\nWorst case scenerio 2 airlines go bk, but 1 goes back to it's original price. That means I will totally break even and not lose anything. (I can't see all 3 major US airlines going BK). If anything, the remaining ones will eat up the other ones market share.\n\nMedium case scenerio: 1 airline goes BK, the other 2 go back to their normal price. In that case I made a decent profit.\n\nBest case scenario: No airline goes BK, and all 3 return to their normal price, and I just tippled my investment.\n\nWhat are your thoughts. This strategy seems like a very safe bet to me.", "created_utc": 1588442888.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gcaxxb/airline_stock_strategy_i_would_like_to_hear_your/", "is_self": true}
