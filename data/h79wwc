I'd like to start playing around with algos and back-testing or paper-trading, but I'm not sure where to start. Googling gives me a lot of outdated links to stuff like Metatrader 4, but I see they have MT5 out now. \n\nAny autists here gone full retard down this path? Suggestions for tools or guides on getting started? My day job is IT & I've got a developer background, so I can handle the technical stuff (although it's probably been 20 years since I have coded in C/C++, so that wouldn't be my first choice anymore.)", "created_utc": 1591920541.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h79wwc/platform_for_ta_backtesting_screening/", "is_self": true}
