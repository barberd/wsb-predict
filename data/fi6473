Think about how depressed you were the first time you blew your account... That's the fear most of ~~the world~~ **WSB** has right now with their ~~life savings and retirement funds~~ **entire accounts in SPY puts and DIS puts.**\n\n**Imagine buying DIS puts, hearing the news that Disney closed their parks, then seeing DIS blast up 11.67% to Pluto the next day. Imagine being reminded of your loss every time you see that fucking mouse. Gleefully dancing, without regard to the pain he brings you, like seeing your ex-gf is truly happy without you and has no conception of the lingering hurt you carry. \"Why can't you just find another girlfriend,\" she says. \"It's easy to find dates on Tinder, I do it all the time!\"**\n\nMore importantly, people are actually worried ~~about the health and safety of the people they love~~ **that Boomers might actually survive this thing.**\n\nWe didn't start the ~~fire~~ **big dick rally**, and if bankers make money on ~~bad events~~ **the Federal Reserve selling future generations into indentured servitude** why not autists as well. I agree. Be safe, play the market.\n\nJust don't fucking dance", "created_utc": 1584130861.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fi6473/just_dont_fucking_dance_20/", "is_self": true}
