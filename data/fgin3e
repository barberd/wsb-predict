Turn SPY into a pennystock!\" I cackled to myself\n\nBut Gay Bears get stomped, and SPY would start to bounce.\n\n\"HOLD WITH THESE DIAMOND HANDS\" I thought, knowing bull traps gonna trap.\n\nThe day grew nigh and my position I sold. A 91.87% loss, $150 into $20.\n\nBut the tale does not end here, for when I wake with my bushy eyes.\n\nI check my account and HOLY FUCK NEGATIVE TENDIES.\n\nMy tendies were fried. Down $26,700 from SPY, to bring me to $26,5k in the hole.\n\nBut how?! I started to cry (jk gay bears don't cry)\n\nI scanned my contracts, for my day trade had been hit!\n\nA SPY contract to fill, lay expired. A $1.55 limit order was his  name.\n\nREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE\n\nRush to my phone. TOS SUPPORT, you must save me now.\n\nMy tendies are toast, this is too burnt for me.\n\n$Twenty seven thousand in the hole, I was promised a Jackson!\n\nSupport guffawed and stared in disbelief. \"Sir you didn't  have a buy order\" he started to decree.\n\nREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE\n\nI had the position! I laughed and I cried with my moves. For my position to not exist, how did i see moves?!\n\nCloser and closer, he started to inspect.\n\n\"Hold teh fuck up, I gotta be back\"\n\nWorking and scrambling, he rushes through support. Team after team, he comes back to me.\n\n\"Shit's FUBAR, you're tendies are too gone. Give me some time, and we'll have a fresh batch soon\".\n\nScared and trusting, I watched my account.\n\nNot long that after did I see my funds freed.\n\nA $26k loss and gain in the early morning hours.\n\nWhat the actual fuck though.\n\nProof: \n\nhttps://imgur.com/wTSp7uv\n\nhttps://imgur.com/wVF71ak\n\nhttps://imgur.com/df45vru\n\nTL:DR: bought and sold SPY contract, buy order  went through on my end but not the brokers end, so I sold the position I held even though I didn't hold the position, wake up to show my option as being exercised for -1 SPY contracts instead of 0.\n\nThey had to go do adjustments to fix my buy order, cause I should be at 0, and there shouldn't be an exercised worthless contract nailing me for $26.7k\n\nEDIT#1: Now I'm showing positive $27k buying power https://imgur.com/su5YFUj", "created_utc": 1583865596.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fgin3e/how_i_woke_up_negative_265k_on_spy_puts/", "is_self": true}
