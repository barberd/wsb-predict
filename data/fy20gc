All-time high unemployment has no impact. Companies offering lower guidance, or pulling guidance altogether, has no impact. Japan and Singapore going backward on containment, has no impact.\n\nI'm not even trying to make this a bitch thread, I'm genuinely trying to understand: now that the Federal Reserve has decided to buy equity and basically make America Europe, what bad news could possibly bring us down? Outside of a meteor hitting the earth, I don't see how we can beat the steady BRRRR of JPow.\n\nBanks report next week. They'll say shit is gonna be bad. Analysts will say \"pRiCeD iN\". We will go up.\n\nChange my mind?\n\n$SPY 5/15 220p", "created_utc": 1586470846.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fy20gc/change_my_mind_as_of_today_the_market_simply_cant/", "is_self": true}
