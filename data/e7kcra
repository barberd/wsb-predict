{"id": "e7kcra", "title": "WKND TRAINING: Diversification", "selftext": "I know WSB hates to diversify, but I'm about to change all your minds with a short story and some key points.        \n      \nStory: In the '90s, I used Schwab. Then, Fidelity offered free money to switch. So, I switched half. Then, Think or Swim came along with his good looks and charm; I thought I'd never need another broker. Fast forward a decade, and here comes Robinhood. I thought, free trades are neat and all, but do I really want another broker? Then, I remembered the famous words of daddy Buffet, \"Diversify yo bonds, nigga.\" So, I did. I got four-brokers-level diversified, and wouldn't you know it....one of them went and offered infinite margin. If I hadn't diversified, I wouldn't have had the opportunity to go fully to my personal risk tolerance. Now, the way I see it, it's only a matter of time until another infinite margin-like situation happens at the other brokers, and \ud83d\udc48 that is why all of y'all need to diversify. If infinite money comes along again, you don't want to miss it because you were with the wrong broker.       \n        \nBullets:      \n - Wu-Tang, mothafucka!     \n - Mom's spaghetti.     \n - ***Whiskey*** and juice, because Gin is gross.     \n - Fuck da Police!       \n - Epstein didn't kill himself.       \n - TDA pegs your dad.    \n - love you guys \ud83d\ude18", "created_utc": 1575754663, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e7kcra/wknd_training_diversification/", "is_self": true}
