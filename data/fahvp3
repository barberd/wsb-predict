Today I didn't color code the calls/puts     but did color code the  companies.\n\nThese   options orders  are on or above the ask. Many have the same expiry and   strike. Also lots  of the orders were sweeps so these ppl were  breaking  down their order  to get filled faster.\n\nAlso   all  these orders volume of the contracts exceeded the open interest  in   multiple trades so it's most likely not closing positions. Either   buy     to  open orders or sell to open orders and based on the   aggressiveness  of the orders one can infer its buy to open. Some of    these may be    hedges  and some most likely not.\n\nData is here -[https://ibb.co/Br5PF3W](https://ibb.co/Br5PF3W)\n\nThe GILD calls seem out of the ordinary with HUGE strikes for the future.  For puts, watch CCL/AAL/V/UBER. CCL and Uber from the virus fears.\n\nI  will say this, don't just enter into positions based on this data       alone in most cases. Use  technicals/fundamentals/options    data-flow/market  sediment all combined  instead of just 1 of these. Use       protection like  spreads if you worry  about losing what u put in    and    be  smart,  understand the risks of putting  $ into weekly    expiry's, consider a longer expiry.\n\nAlso with the market going lower use technicals/fundamentals/options   data-flow/market  sediment all combined", "created_utc": 1582833549, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fahvp3/aggressiveunusual_options_aalcclgildmsft/", "is_self": true}
