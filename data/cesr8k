And today there's an extremely hot entry point into this time-tested asset class: after another bank has announced that it will cut ties with the private prison industry, GEO Group (prison REIT with work programs in its facilities) has plummeted to around 18.15 a share, the lowest price point in years, as of today.\n\nGEO's dividend yield is now over 10%, although the ex dividend date was today so you'll have to wait for a while to get your first check. Don't worry about the finance issue though, they have revolving credit facilities locked in for the next several years, and by the time they need new loans this whole \"kids in cages\" thing will have totally blown over. And they're globally diversified too, with operations in the UK, South Africa, and Australia. All of which look to remain or increasingly become dystopian police states well into our climate change-ravaged Mad Max future. What I'm saying is, there has never been a better time to own your very own piece of a labor camp, migrant detention facility, or youth offender behavioral treatment center. \n\nSome fun math: GEO has about 96,000 beds and a market cap of ~2.3 billion. Some back-of-the-envelope math puts the price of one modern-day capitive laborer/slave at $23,958 USD on the open market, or about 1,320 shares of GEO. Virtually owning one slave would therefore bring in an income of around $2,500 a year, not bad for going through a third party! Your slave should pay for itself in under ten years, assuming the dividend holds steady.
