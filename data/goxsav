Or do increased operation costs and lower capacity hurt them in the long run?\n\n\u201cCasino operators and employees in the largest U.S. gambling market got some welcome news at the start of the Memorial Day weekend: a June 4 target date for reopening.\n\nNevada Governor Steve Sisolak, a first-term Democrat, announced the reopening date Friday. Resorts in Las Vegas have been shuttered since March due to the coronavirus, resulting in a surge in unemployment and a collapse of tax revenue. Sisolak has been under pressure for weeks to reopen one of the state\u2019s most-important industries.\n\nHe joins politicians in other states who are getting comfortable with the return of large entertainment venues. Casinos in Louisiana and Mississippi opened in the past week. And California Governor Gavin Newsom said Friday his state\u2019s casinos, most of them run by Native American tribes, could open June 8. \u201cWe\u2019re putting out guidelines not just for casinos, but card rooms as well,\u201d he said.\n\nA March study by the Brookings Institution identified Las Vegas as one of the areas hardest hit by the virus in the U.S., with some 342,000 people, or one-third of the workforce, out of a job.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-22/nevada-governor-targets-june-4-date-for-reopening-casinos", "created_utc": 1590203994.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/goxsav/nevada_governor_targets_june_4_date_for_reopening/", "is_self": true}
