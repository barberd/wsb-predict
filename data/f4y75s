{"id": "f4y75s", "title": "SPCE - Reasonable Assessment", "selftext": "\nHere\u2019s the background about SPCE that all you bulls rarely discuss: \n\nSPCE had a failed mission 5 years ago and blamed the pilot for the crash. Pretty miserable excuse. \n\nCEO has said for the last 5 years that their SS2 aircrafts were set to launch each year, and of course, they always blamed contractors for not reaching \u201cmilestones\u201d to get it all going. Again, miserable excuse. \n\n\nHere\u2019s a summary of why it won\u2019t succeed and further analysis on the speculative market size that these uninformed bulls have:\n\nThey have 600 pre-orders. Why go for such a small number if they have the potential to capture a much large speculated market that the bulls are contending? If they are front runners in this race, they have early bird advantage to take in much more and backlog them if they need to. But why 600 with revenues of only 150M?\n\nMarket cap is currently 5B, which is 42x revenue. And what do the bulls say about this? \u201cStop looking at current revenue, they have a much larger market\u201d. Of who? Multi millionaires and billionaires? \u201cThen they have hypersonic travel for 2 hour travel to London.\u201d Who actually fucking needs to get to London or any other country in 2 hours just to pay a gigantic premium when they can get a private jet and have a personalize ride. You think C-suites are going to have diarrhea all day and will need to get to London in 2 hours? Last I check, most execs, consultants, etc get to their destination days in advanced anyway. \n\nThen it comes to market cap. I can\u2019t tell if this is a joke, but I hear bull gang compare SPCE  market size to Tesla, Spotify, IBM, Microsoft,  Uber, Lyft, etc. I\u2019m not going to even have to explain this. The statement in itself has a high enough autistic frequency for even the lowest spectrum of autism to understand how retarded it is. Yes, buying an electric vehicle that will last for years, purchasing a music subscription,  buying laptops and software, and getting a daily ride to work is equivalent to going to space for 250k.\n\nNow, when I say 250k, I hear bull gang say \u201cyou\u2019re retarded. They will reduce cost when they increase efficiency and have a fleet of 500 planes flying daily.\u201d Goddamn this is almost as autist has stormwillpass plays. Firstly, if they reduce cost, it won\u2019t be by significant margins. Why? Because space travel will not be cheap no matter how you put it. Cost of production won\u2019t change unless they can do it with cheap labor in China. Efficiency will be the same unless they hire a herd of engineers working 24/7. R&amp;D will continue to cost more as they try to scale this with large carriers. Ffs, they took years just to get 2 damn planes right. You guys are out here talking about 500 planes. As for scalability. By the time they scale, if they even can, BlueOrigins and SpaceX would have listed and would be flying herds of middle class enthusiasts to space. \n\nNow on to the preorders and future orders. 600 pre-orders are not going to fly this year. They will be backlogged to shit. Why? Because they don\u2019t own airspace. They can barely get their contractors in line with the schedule and you\u2019re expecting them to make 100 flights to the edge of space all in half a year? They expect Branson to be their first passenger on his birthday in July. Do the math. That would be nearly flying every single day from August-December. They have 2 aircrafts right now. Do you really think they are going to expose those two newly made (and still technically under progress) aircrafts under that much fly time? And do you have any idea how risky something like this would be? They aren\u2019t flying planes. Planes can fly all day every day with turbine engines and at low altitudes. We are talking about rocket fuel to the edge of space. Stop with this talk about how they are going to get all these pre orders done and then add a huge list to the log. My guess, they might fulfill those 600 clients in the next two years. And have a backlog of irked clients that paid such a large deposit to sit around and watch Branson slamming young girls on his private island. \n\nAnd then the talk about hypersonic travel. You guys are talking about it like they have done it. That\u2019s a vision, not a reality. They can\u2019t even commercialize sub-hypersonic travel and they are talking about hypersonic travel at the forefront of this project as if it\u2019s reality. You\u2019re hearing an upbeat CEO trying to raise more capital. You\u2019re drowning out the facts and the reality that they haven\u2019t even flown a damn crew to space yet. They have even had a full 6 passengers fly yet. \n\nAs for the newly released sec filing for the warrants. 31M shares. Bull gang is thinking, ah this is regulatory stuff, it won\u2019t get exercised. Literally two funds just filed for 11M on the same day. You think this is a coincidence? A couple people DMed me about this exact thing. They are listed for $11.50 per share. Institutions aren\u2019t going to be buying in at market price at this time. Those funds are buying at the warrant price and that\u2019s probably why it happened on the same day.", "created_utc": 1581891005, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f4y75s/spce_reasonable_assessment/", "is_self": true}
