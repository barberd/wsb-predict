{"id": "fzmlsv", "title": "SPY 1/1/25 150p", "selftext": "TLDR; Read the bottom of the post\n\nYesterday, [I told you](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fyvnxt/what_happened_and_why_markets_seem_irrational/) about the events of the past few months and what it will mean for us in the near future. Well, since I had nothing better to do since we're all stuck in our houses for the next few months, I've decided to do another DD where we look back at the history of the stock market, 100-year trends, basic macro-economics, and how we could have SPY at 84 in the next few years.\n\n# A History of the Stock Market and the US Economy\n\n[DJI 1900 - 2020, log scale](https://preview.redd.it/ebvoys6w3as41.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=b415f5f30739160a2e0e8fb855f7735dc2b02575)\n\nThe chart you see above is a log-scale graph of the Dow from 1900 to now. You\u2019ll notice that there\u2019s a long-term support line, which made contact in the depth of the Great Depression, and during the late 1970s. So what does this line represent?\n\nIn the short term, markets are pretty random and irrational. In the long term, stock prices usually reflect earnings, and thus stock indexes grow alongside the economy. The purple line you see here is the exponential growth of the economy\u2019s productivity (and inflation to a certain extent) since the 1900s in cycles of growth driven by technological innovation, with the expectation of growth accelerating the inflation of equity valuations, followed by a crisis changing the fundamentals of the economy, and finally stagnation.\n\n**Pre-1929 - Electrification**\n\nThe period of the beginning of the 1900s to 1930 saw the rise of electricity being used in industries and in households, along with mass production techniques. This led to the workforce being more efficient at making things, leading to an increase in earnings, GDP, and the stock market.\n\n**1930s to mid-1940s - Depression and War**\n\nWe all know what happened during these periods. The Great Depression, which eventually led World War II. What caused this? To this day, economists still argue about what exactly happened, but here\u2019s a simplified version of what most people can agree on.\n\nFirst, what causes a recession? Fundamentally, a recession happens when the supply and demand in the economy become mismatched. If you have a sudden decrease in a supply, we call this a supply shock. This usually happens with an important commodity that\u2019s important to the economy, like oil. We\u2019ll revisit this in the 1970s. A sudden increase in supply is also a supply shock and can also cause an economic decline, such as in Venezuela's case. But in the 1930s, this was a demand shock.\n\nThere was a decrease in demand after the roaring 20s due to the large amount of consumer debt that people took on to fund their new household appliances, like toasters. In other words, consumers and the economy overall was overleveraged. These debt cycles are a natural economic phenomenon, but the economic decline was exasperated by the Fed\u2019s poor decision making; they basically did the opposite of what they\u2019re doing right now. They raised interest rates in an attempt to preserve the dollar\u2019s value, and a liquidity crunch followed where everyone was trying to get their hands on dollars. This caused a deflationary spiral. Banks, with no actual backing from the Fed at this time, started having runs where customers demand to withdraw all their deposits. Since banks usually loan out most of their cash, many of them begin running out of cash and go under, causing more people to panic that they\u2019ll lose all of their deposits and causing more bank runs.\n\nThis depression eventually led to a decade of economic depression, followed by a devastating war that destroyed much of the world\u2019s economy and infrastructure - except for countries in the Americas.\n\n**Late-1940s to early 1970s - The post-war boom**\n\nThe golden age of capitalism. This time instead of it being driven by some new technology, it was a combination of increased global trade, Keynesian economics, and the fact that the US was one of the few countries that didn\u2019t have almost all productive capacity destroyed in WWII.\n\n**1970s - Stagflation**\n\nThis was a period of stagflation, with both high inflation and economic stagnation, and was caused by a supply shock. Specifically, OPEC decided to cut their supply of oil to the US because they didn\u2019t like their support of Israel. Higher oil prices mean higher prices to produce everything and less things being produced. The Fed meanwhile had no idea how to respond to this, since according to Keynesian theory, high inflation and high unemployment were impossible. When you have stagnation, you lower interest rates, but with inflation already rampant this makes a bad situation worse.\n\n**1980s - 2020 - The Information Age**\n\nThe most recent long-term economic boom is the result of improved efficiency from globalization, computers, and the internet. Except for a small blip in 2008 caused by some dumbasses on Wall Street thinking a diversified pool of mortgages to people with no income or assets deserve a AAA rating, the economy has been enjoying a period of consistent growth - but for how long?\n\n**2020 - 2030 - Stagnation?**\n\nThere\u2019s a good argument here that we\u2019re at the top of the long-term business cycle, and that the GDP growth in the recent years has not been from increased productivity but fueled by debt and low interest rates. Think about it - it's been over 10 years since the last recession. Yet, throughout this entire time, the Fed rate has been held to effectively 0 and the government has been maintaining a deficit like we\u2019re still in the 2008 recession.\n\n[Fed funds rate, 1960 - 2020](https://preview.redd.it/05b1ain56as41.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=126897b35b6d72adce6abe047dc395699abb6732)\n\n[US govt. surplus \\/ deficit](https://preview.redd.it/ywmsfco66as41.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=43cdfcb1d0dfdb820c9e5441b1505ce8c2a898b2)\n\nEven with all this stimulus going on, the GDP is struggling to even get to 3%. If we didn\u2019t have artificially low interest rates and high federal deficits masking the GDP growth numbers, we\u2019d be seeing the US economy slowly head towards yet another period of stagnation. In fact, there\u2019s another very large country that experienced this - Japan.\n\n# Japan - The Economy of the Future\n\n[Bank of Japan interest rates](https://preview.redd.it/v6qj5fhg6as41.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=84cdbd023744e6ff606543bceaba2369cc98b507)\n\n[Japanese Government surplus \\/ deficits](https://preview.redd.it/42za9ewh6as41.png?width=1410&format=png&auto=webp&s=59f22284c6e2e8292d08ea66f8cc77cad7ed940a)\n\nAfter nearly two decades of low interest rates and budget deficits, Japan can barely get their real GDP growth above 2%.\n\n[Japan GDP](https://preview.redd.it/73v8b9sp6as41.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=b54891a9f59801599f0086b8f799bbdc463682ff)\n\nLet\u2019s look at how the Japanese stock market is doing during this time.\n\n[Nikkei 225, 1980 - 2020](https://preview.redd.it/h0gtdxhr6as41.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9f4b878d85a18eebc01575a21904c5a03b34a25)\n\nWhat you\u2019re seeing here is the Nikkei 225 growing to its peak in 1990, crashing, and then never recovering to its previous highs. The Lost Score (20 years). But why didn\u2019t it ever recover? Don\u2019t stonks and the economy only go up in the long run?\n\nIn the late 1980s, Japan experienced an asset bubble fueled by **uncontrolled money supply and credit expansion**, overheating the asset market. They started to even start to buy corporate bonds in 2009 and buy stocks in 2010 out of desperation. Huh, this sounds pretty similar to what the Fed is doing right now.\n\n[Japanese Yen Inflation Rate](https://preview.redd.it/oftsdxex6as41.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfd500c5f8ac4395f4506a0933361767a233dca7)\n\nWhy did they do this? Because they were so reckless in their monetary easing policies that when the asset bubble popped and people stopped spending as much money due to the wealth effect. The Bank of Japan couldn\u2019t do anything to get people to spend money again, having already overheated their markets, and Japan went to two decades of deflation. They\u2019ve caused a **liquidity trap**.\n\nThe Bank of Japan and Japanese government has done everything to try to keep their GDP growing despite nothing actually driving it. Any productivity gains they would have gotten from the adoption of information technology was overshadowed by the decline of their automotive and electronics industries as they became less competitive with the rise of the Asian Tigers, and eventually China.\n\nHistory doesn't repeat itself but it often rhymes. We\u2019ve seen that the US economy go into economic stagnation in the past, and modern economies are still in economic stagnation, with nothing except for unsustainable central bank money printing and government debt driving GDP growth. We\u2019ve also seen stock prices rise to new highs, despite nothing fundamentally changing in the real economy justifying the productivity growth across every industry. Low interest rates have also made stock buybacks the norm, with some companies like $PLAY levering themselves to buy back $630M of its own shares in 2019. Their market cap on Jan 1 2020 was around $1.2B. Are we in an asset bubble?\n\n# The Stock Market Bubble\n\nWell, what is an asset bubble? It\u2019s when asset prices surge beyond what the fundamentals of them warrant it. It\u2019s when investors become irrational in their valuation, and assume that the price of an asset will continue to go up in the future with no fundamental reasons justifying why it will other than that\u2019s what happened in the past. People on r/investing start telling people that they should \u201cDollar Cost Average\u201d into the markets when they go down because stocks will go back to new ATHs in a few years.\n\nEven with the argument that stocks will rebound in the near term to new ATHs because that\u2019s what happened in the past, this is only true if you don\u2019t look at data past 50 years ago and you pretend the US stock exchanges are the only ones in the world. Look at what happened in the 1970s. The Dow didn\u2019t make new significant highs in between 1966 and 1982. That\u2019s 16 years. If you account for the high inflation going on at this time, you would have been slowly losing money in real terms. Even more recently, look at the stock market in Japan. 30 years later and the Nikkei 225 still hasn\u2019t recovered to its previous highs. Imaging DCA-ing into that decline. Meanwhile in Europe, the Euro Stoxx 50 hasn\u2019t come anywhere close to their 2000 highs from 20 years ago. The idea that the stock market will fundamentally always go up in a time span of a decade, which is the mainstream belief touted by every financial advisor and finance gurus is flawed; history and almost every major country\u2019s stock markets show this.\n\n[Euro Stoxx 50, 1990 - 2020](https://preview.redd.it/yupt7ozt7as41.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=0837c4aff8dd7eb088d28647547d7e7d72d2bcc5)\n\nHow can we tell if we\u2019re in a bubble? Let\u2019s look at the fundamentals of stocks, and what should be driving the true valuation of them - Earnings.\n\n[S&P500 Shiller PE ratio](https://preview.redd.it/gobstuyy7as41.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=96143d6870fdb9c02293bcb6f29a7c069f36a6ec)\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know if you\u2019re in a bubble until it bursts.\n\n**The Bottom**\n\nThe US economy is being driven by debt and consumer confidence. What happens when a black swan event happens that causes a supply shock by locking down supply chains, a demand shock by not allowing the service economy to operate, and another supply shock in the opposite direction happens in oil, because OPEC? Uncertainty and consumer confidence and spending to go down. After a decade of easy money, it might be hard for the Fed to do anything to restart consumer confidence, even years after COVID-19 is eradicated.\n\nLet\u2019s look back at the long term resistance in the Dow. If we do go into a decade-long deflationary spiral like Japan, we might be on our way to making contact with it, but it will be a slow, multi-year decline. If it takes 3 years to reach the 100-year trend, that will be the DJI declining to 10000 by 2023. That looks bad right? Let\u2019s calculate what a bottom would look like using another method. During the last two periods of long-term stagnation (1930s and 1970s), we saw the Shiller PE ratio of the S&P500 drop down to 8 at the lowest levels. Today it is at 26. Even with pre-lockdown earnings, when the economy was in \u201cgreat shape\u201d, with low unemployment and high consumer confidence, this would represent a 70% decline in stock valuations, leaving us with the Dow at 7000 and S&P500 at 840. Even going to the historic mean of 17, we should be seeing at least a 35% decline with the Dow at 15400 and S&P500 at 1800.\n\nIn other words, as stock valuations cool down toward normal levels, we\u2019re likely going to see the Dow go to somewhere between 7000 and 15400, and the S&P500 go somewhere between 1800 and 840 in the next few years.\n\n[\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bhat](https://preview.redd.it/qafgn26m8as41.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=7227447a2f129e6871e73832472e75b1880ba032)\n\nTLDR; Read the title\n\nEDIT - Turns out you can't buy 2025 puts in Robinhood, so SPY 12/16/2022 175p\n\nInteresting video that goes a bit more in depth about the debt-driven growth of the US economy and stock market, and the liquidity trap its in - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Loj0z43VZ7I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Loj0z43VZ7I)", "created_utc": 1586651771.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fzmlsv/spy_1125_150p/", "is_self": true}
