{"id": "fs03rj", "title": "LEAPs", "selftext": "So I\u2019ve been looking at spy call LEAPs lately and I\u2019ll probably be picking some up later next week when SPY inevitably falls back to the 220s or maybe even lower. So buying a more ITM call would increase your delta by a lot and even make the option less risky, but they\u2019re expensive. On the other hand the DEEP OTM options are stupid cheap and if we assume that by summer 2022 SPY will be at $450 and that would be when you exit the position then what would the returns be.\n\n\nEDIT: I\u2019ll just do the math actually brb\n\nOk well it turns out that the return on the OTM ones gets to the hundreds of percents (like 4-500) and the deeper ITM you go, the safer it is and the lower the potential return. ATM makes like 3-400. The ITM didn\u2019t go past like 125%. Still a solid return though over 2 years so it just depends on how bullish you are once the market subsided\n\nJust to put into perspective since most people don\u2019t really rationalize a return in their head. A 400% return on $5,000 is $25,000. Let that sink in. I\u2019m not your financial advisor but this seems like a great opportunity just don\u2019t buy in now or you\u2019ll be down 50% next week\n\nAlso I just thought I\u2019d add that if SPY hits $500 by June 2022 and you held an OTM LEAP call you\u2019d get a 2,214% return. That\u2019s $110,700 ($169,250 if it hits $520)", "created_utc": 1585605134.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fs03rj/leaps/", "is_self": true}
