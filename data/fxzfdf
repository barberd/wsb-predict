At least I'm still up 30% YTD\n\nI get that you are all angry and feel that this market is totally retarded, and maybe it is. It's entirely possible that stocks are overvalued AF, and it's a complicated question to answer for anybody atm, even the most skilled of analysts.\n\nBut you need to separate your personal feelings caused by your trading addiction and your positions that right now are deep blood red with what's better for the world economy. I see many of you critizing what the FED and other central banks are doing  unconditionally. I think it's best if you get a little lesson of macroeconomics before you go out pointing the finger at a specific group of people.\n\nPremise: ***this is very basic stuff*** for people that don't have a lot of knowledge\n\n**1) The situation before COVID**\n\nThe economy is made of cycles, and the most important one is the credit cycle. As humans we use credit as a tool to accelerate growth and allocate resources more efficiently, because if we didn't, economic growth would be significantly slower.\n\nAs long as the economy grows at a faster rate than debt, we are good. Except that  sometimes it doesn't beacuse we often give credit to some people/companies/goverments even tough they will spend the money badly and in a way that won't produce growth.\n\nThis behaviour over period of times, accelerated by low interest rates, makes debt grow faster than production. Money is cheap to borrow, so every boomer takes a loan to buy a luxury SUV, get his son a degree in Culinary Art, buy a big house; and every corporation takes loan to blow it and executive jets, dinners etc. Even goverments start spending money in useless ways. And clearly banks are willing to lend money to all of this retards since interest is low. In the seek of yield we can see the emergence of toxic derivatives like the ones that lead to the 2008 financial crisis (CDOs etc.) ... Banks and funds will leverage to the tits every fucking thing they can buy to pump up their shares and bonuses\n\nThis leads to high levels of debt, let me break down some US stats for you:\n\n* Consumer debt to GDP was circa 66%, totalling at $14 trillion\n* Public debt  to GDP was circa 107%, totalling at $23 trillion\n* Corporate debt to GDP was circa 47%, totalling at $10 trillion\n\n**2) And then COVID when came. Risk of a depression triggered by a liquidity crisis.**\n\nBefore COVID we had a looming debt crisis above our heads. But then COVID came, with a worldwide lockdown. Not only the debt burden gets worse with a GDP reduction, but we have a liquidity crisis, which would lead the debt defaults. Companies can't do business so they fire everyone, people can't take their pay home, nobody pays taxes. Where do we find money to repay the debt?\n\nYou see, the problem with debt is that debt is credit, and credit is considered as an asset, And in an extremely leveraged economy like this, the amount of credit is vastly superior to the amount of debt. Everyone thinks that they are rich, beacuse they have lots of cash in the bank, but they don't realize that their cash positive balance is another's person debt balance. It's how a bank works, lends your cash to a retard and fucks you with obscene fees in the process.\n\nIf people default on their debt, everybody suddenly discover that they aren't rich anymore, every asset starts depreciating in a spiral, people spend less because they have less cash, so they earn less and defaults grow again and the cycle continues, banks get squeezed etc. You get the point. This is called **deflation.** It's very important that you understand this: **there is a negative relatioship between inflation and uneployment. If lots of people suddenly become unemployed, we have deflation**\n\n**3) The central bank steps in**\n\nDeflation means that people need cash in their hands. And the only one who can magically print it and deliver it is JPow. Up until now, the FED has used the majority of the cash printed to buy toxic corporate bonds (and as a side effect inflating the stock market). Sure, this has rescured the irresponsible lenders that caused a debt crisis in the first place, and the stupid borrowers who blew cash on bullshit. But bailing out corporations also prevents them from failing and (at least in theory) from firing every employee, and keeps the economy of production going. **The problem isn't bailing out corporations from a liquidity crisis, the problem is that we need to find a way to prevent the useless debt in the first place**. There needs to be a system that stops a bank to lend huge amount of money to a shitty company just to blow it all off on executives compensation packages and stocks buybacks. And the same stuff applies for consumer debt. **It's all about where the money goes, not how much money is printed.**\n\nI also see a lot of people talking about inflation as if it was a bad thing. **In a deflationary environment like this, an inflationary policy is the healthiest thing that can happen to an economy**, because it puts (at least in theory) money in the hands of the people, softening the liquidity crisis and the debt burden. This COVID thing will probably be the biggest thing in the last 50 years, **HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY NEEDS TO BE PRINTED**. It's what is spent on in the first place that matters", "created_utc": 1586462189.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxzfdf/a_few_basic_explanations_for_the_less_econsavy/", "is_self": true}
