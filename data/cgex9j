{"id": "cgex9j", "title": "$T earnings DD", "selftext": "T has recently gotten alot of love from le Street because *that juicy yield*. Sentiment is bullish. T however is isn't exactly known for its earnings pops and often reports disappointing / mixed results.\n\nSo what do I think is going to happen?\nI'l give you degenerates a couple my take on what's likely to happen. \n\nFirst off when playing earnings you need to know what the market focusses on. Even if that's not the right thing to focus on. You're playing earnings, you're not investing in the stock. So what does the market focus on? Revenue and subscribers numbers . \n\nMy expectations for T\n**1. Mobility.**\n\nMeets or exceeds expectations. Stable business that has been performing decent recently. Not expecting a large beat or anything special\n\n**2. Entertainment group.**\n\nContinued DTV subscriber loss. \n\nIt probably won't be as bad as the last two quarters since the raised prices in those two but their might be a hangover effect because the last price hikes. \n\nFiber will likely meet or exceed targets recent performance has been good.\n\n**3. Warner Media**\n\nI expect small HBO subscriber loss it won't be anything since most people who only watched for GoT just pirated that shit. \n\nThere is also good case to be made for them beat on revenue expectations since had pretty good box office success and hits on HBO. \n\n**4. Latin America &amp; Xandr**\n\nNobody gives a shit about these\n\n**Takeaway**: no large beats expected, might  see some small beats and some subscriber churn in their media segments.  Could see a decent drop in stock price when the market that remembers that this company is kinda poop.\n\nBuy puts.", "created_utc": 1563810646, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cgex9j/t_earnings_dd/", "is_self": true}
