I decided I don't know options well, but I read WSB and that wasn't about to stop me. Two weeks in I make it up to about $400 thanks to some Uber puts. Yesterday, however, I decide the market is definitely most certainly going down in flames so I put a third of my investment into SPY puts. Cue my shock and disbelief when the market opens up, and by lunchtime I see they are having a sale on SPY puts so I put another third in. Near closing things are looking bleak, but they're now liquidating SPY puts so in goes the last third of my game money.\n\nBut here's the thing, this is just $300 for the game. I've got other more sensible investments in IRA's and 401Ks and regular boring brokerages. The market brought in over $2,000 today alone for me, and I couldn't be more upset. I'm losing this stupid game now and I kinda wish the market just tanked like I expected.\n\nDown with the market tomorrow. I don't care if I lose $10k IRL I need the market to tank so hard I come out on top of this game. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/JINcN4l.jpg\n\nSPY puts or bust", "created_utc": 1570659226, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dfoczw/i_made_over_2000_today_and_quite_frankly_im_pissed/", "is_self": true}
