{"id": "fdl6zi", "title": "Don\u2019t worry about SPY going up so much, it\u2019s going back down tomorrow", "selftext": "I have many reasons as to why this the stonks will implode tomorrow. Firstly, SPY went up by exactly 4.20%. This number has a large significance as it is normally matched with 69. So through deductive reasoning, SPY is tumbling by 6.9% tomorrow. So you retards that have 3/6 300 puts will be in luck tomorrow. Another big reason is that today is what many intellectuals consider \u201chump day\u201d. That\u2019s why SPY went up both Monday and Tuesday AND today! So once again through deductive reasoning, Thursday and Friday are gonna be pretty red days. Thirdly, coronavirus (also known as gay bulls disease) is reeking havoc everywhere in the world. There\u2019s absolutely no way that anything should be going up so through deductive reasoning, everything should be going down. All these factors should help my UAL 50p 3/20 and your autistic trades", "created_utc": 1583361572, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fdl6zi/dont_worry_about_spy_going_up_so_much_its_going/", "is_self": true}
