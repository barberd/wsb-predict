I love buying FDs and watching numbers go from positive to negative, but I think I'm finally going insane. I \\~\\~pretty much\\~\\~ lost all the money I made working this up till now. Last $300 on some $DIS and $FB calls that expired today. I actually started punching my couch, like, I was that mad. But, I want to keep going. Just applied for a credit card and apparently they going to give me $1k margin at 0% interest for 6 months!!?!?!  Kind of insane if you ask me. If I play my cards right I can make my money back, and build credit at the same time. I need you to stop me, or don't. Whatever's best. PLS HELP AM  \n\n\nADICKDID", "created_utc": 1573862707, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dwz9b5/it_hit_me_in_the_face_last_night/", "is_self": true}
