Turns out retard publishers can\u2019t convert lakhs into $. \n\nhttps://gulfnews.com/world/asia/india/covid-19-india-to-boost-aid-to-economy-with-265-billion-package-1.1589296630087\n\nSo, if you\u2019ve been following recent events, you might have observed a shift in global opinion towards a more anti-China stance. In other words, nations like Japan, America, and India are growing more distrustful of China\u2019s economic expansionist policies, and trying to nurture local manufacturing, ultimately reducing their nation\u2019s reliance on Chinese goods. Here we\u2019ll observe how this could benefit other countries, particularly India, who\u2019s PM just addressed their nation and announced a stimulus package. Yes, you degenerates, you can place bets on which country is most likely to benefit from China\u2019s loss in tendies. This can be utilized as a long term and short-term play. \n\nTo begin with, China\u2019s public image is at an all time low, with President Tendies himself accusing them of developing the virus in a lab in Wuhan. Moreover, this sentiment is spilling over globally. Other nations are realizing their dependence on China may leave them vulnerable to economic exploitation at their hands, and deprived of certain goods during testing times, such as a war or pandemic. To counter this, nations are going to great lengths and incentivizing local manufacturing. For example, Japan just allocated 243.5bn Yen to shift production back to Japan. This bill also includes billions to shift production to other countries. Translation: anywhere but China. \n\n[Trump\u2019s Wuhan lab leak theory ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.smh.com.au/national/it-would-be-unwise-to-dismiss-donald-trump-s-wuhan-lab-leak-theory-20200507-p54qyg.html)\n\n[Japan Production Shift ](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/04/09/business/japan-sets-aside-\u00a5243-5-billion-help-firms-shift-production-china/#.XrrKriXhXDs)\n\n\nThis raises a very interesting question: who will fill China\u2019s void; which East Asian pie hole will the western powers now use to satisfy their glutinous consumer-crazed urges? I\u2019m betting India\u2019s looking really cute atm in that short dress and unlimited labor, many of whom speak (some, or something similar to) English. I\u2019m betting this because most of the FAGMAN companies already have a strong presence there and have committed to increasing their presence there in the long term. For example, apple are planning on shifting most of their iPhone production from China to India. And big daddy Bezos just announced he\u2019ll enslave, sorry, I mean employ 1 million more Indians by 2025. Moreover, Facebook just invested and bought 9.99% of Jio, a part of Reliance Industries for 5.7bn to increase its presence in India as well. This resulted in an increase in stock price for both companies. Now, you smart guys with calls already know the power of the FAGMAN and I\u2019m pretty sure all these companies individually are all worth more than the GPD of Madagascar. This sets India up for a huge slam dunk in terms of their global presence and GDP, and companies like Reliance benefitting from foreign investment. \n\n[Apple production shift from China to India ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/9to5mac.com/2020/05/11/iphone-production/amp/)\n\n[Bezos pledges to create 1 million jobs in India ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.financialexpress.com/industry/jeff-bezos-says-amazon-to-create-1-million-jobs-in-india-by-2025/1827095/lite/)\n\n[Facebook investment in Jio ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/facebook-reliance-jio/amp/)\n\n\nNow moving on to the PM Narendra \u201c56 inch chest\u201d Modi\u2019s speech, the catalyst that could cause an immediate spike in INDA. ThePM made the speech announcing 2 main things. 1. Free naan for everyone to the tune of $265bn(nearly 10% of their GDP) 2. \u201cA self-reliant India\u201d. Translation: FU China, we\u2019re coming for your tendies. No wonder their troops are fist fighting at their border (link included). Keep in mind Modi made this speech after markets closed in India, and Indian markets haven\u2019t opened for tomorrow yet. Time as of posting this is 10:45pm IST; two hours after speech. Now, any economist can tell you a stimulus package hits the markets like a bump of pure yayo to the dome. The question is, how long will this high remain in the Indian markets. Considering the level of corruption in India, a huge amount, even backdoor payments, could go directly into the coffers of their corporations, causing an immediate spike and rally in the Indian markets starting tomorrow. Stock brokers in India are rejoicing as we speak (linked).\n\n[India China troops fist fight ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/indian-and-chinese-soldiers-injured-in-cross-border-fistfight-says-delhi)\n\n[Stimulus Package + \u201cself reliant India\u201d](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.ndtv.com/india-news/prime-minister-narendra-modis-address-to-nation-on-coronavirus-covid-19-lockdown-top-quotes-2227682%3famp=1&akamai-rum=off)\n\n[Indian stock brokers rejoice ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/market-to-rally-on-thursday-as-modi-offers-big-bonanza-stimulus-package/amp_articleshow/75700846.cms)\n\n\n\u201cAlright, that\u2019s great, but how can I make money on this retard?\u201d Alright, I think there\u2019s 2 ways to play this.\n\nShort term: anticipate an increase in Sensex and NIFTY starting tomorrow and play short term weekly calls. An increase could turn into a rally in the Indian markets, but it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess how long it could last, 1 day? 1 week? 1 month? It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess during corona times. \n\nLong term: play long term options into Jan 2021 and 2022, anticipating a rise in the balance sheets of Indian companies and their economy. Remember INDA tracks only top firms in the Indian securities market. \n\nTLDR: End of Asian fettish. New world domination plan: gas stations everywhere. PM Modi gives coke IV to the Indian economy. Long term and short term calls on INDA viable. \n\nP.s. for anyone who\u2019s offended, I\u2019m of Indian descent.
