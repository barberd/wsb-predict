{"id": "dypior", "title": "Lowes ( LOW) ER Tomorrow - My DD/Prediction", "selftext": "Earlier this year, Lowes put a restructuring plan into action that would serve as a foundation for them to challenge their rival, Home Depot.  Since then, they've been executing on that plan and executing it well.  In Q2 the plan began bearing fruit and, even with deflation of lumber prices and tariff concerns, they were able to do well enough to outpace Home Depot.  Their plan revolves around increasing their use of technology to modernize and streamline their supply chain to lower costs and improve profitability, while focusing on selling products and services to professionals.  The pros don't waste time buying a couple light bulbs or remodeling the living room... they buy the materials to build the whole house which increases per-ticket prices and provides a sustainable and dependable base.  In August, the home-building market hit 12-year highs and has continued to break new and higher ground.  You can also throw in the fact that the Fed has cut interest rates, which should also feed the housing mortgage market.  This all has put Lowes in a good position to release a good ER and good guidance going forward into 2020.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen they release their earnings report tomorrow morning before open, I believe they will beat the expected sales and earnings.  Since HD just reported earnings today, I am sure that analysts will compare the reports from the two companies.  As long as they report even decent numbers and decent guidance going forward, they will look incredible compared to how Home Depot shit the bed this morning and LOW stock price will jump up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOr to put this all in a way that WSB might be more accustomed to...\n\nIf you show up at home and hand your Mom and Dad a report card full of B's you would probably look OK.  On the other hand, if you wait until right after your older brother just told your parents that he just knocked up his 15 yr old girlfriend THEN hand them that same report card full of B's, you'd look like a fucking superstar.  Well...  Home Depot just gave the market the bad news this morning and Lowes will be handing the market a report card full of B's tomorrow morning.  $LOW to the moon, get your CALLS now or miss out on your wheelbarrow full of tendies.
