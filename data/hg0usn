That $900 account grew and grew and within 3 weeks, he had $280,000. Roughly enough to buy 7 Model 3s. \n\nBut this boy was a greedy little piggy and decided $280k was not enough. He now wanted 1 million dollars. So he traded and traded until his account got slapped in the face with a brick called Ron\u00e3. He was back where he started and is slowly clawing his way back up. \n\n__The moral of the story:__ Always buy the Tesla.\n\nEdit: [proof](https://imgur.com/gallery/5KYMaHV)", "created_utc": 1593145074.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hg0usn/the_tale_of_tesla_and_the_little_piggy/", "is_self": true}
