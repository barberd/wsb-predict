Passive money buys it because passive money is literally braindead. Its size prevents it from selling off (see: Feb. 2018).\n\n2) AWS creates an uneven playing field. It gives Amazon a theoretical advantage in perpetuity online over competitors.\n\n3) Point two is made evident by Amazon's outsized fraction of online retail spending.\n\n4) As a result of 2 and 3, I fail to see how there isn't insane regulatory risk, comparable to, but not identical in nature to, AT&amp;T back in the good ol' days.\n\n5) Split off AWS, and a solid chunk of the business units become far less competitive. Herein lies a way to evaluate regulatory risk, yet I don't think the market is pricing it in.\n\nTbh I'm just mad my SPY puts aren't ITM yet.", "created_utc": 1562689617, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cb33zj/amzn_is_bs/", "is_self": true}
