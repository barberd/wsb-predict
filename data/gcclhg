{"id": "gcclhg", "title": "The Nostradamus of SPY; the Lil Yachty Prophecy", "selftext": "There\u2019s been a few low effort autistic posts about Lil Yachty\u2019s music releases having a negative effect on the US stock market. It\u2019s my belief that these retards are actually correct. Lil Yachty\u2019s music releases are Nostradamus-like in their consistency to predict drops in SPY.\n\nDoubtless one of the most popular options to trade on WSB is SPY. So instead of following the S&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;P or DOWJ, I decided to spend some time on an autistic investigation into whether or not there was a drop in SPY around the date of Yachty\u2019s music releases.\n\n**RESULTS MAY BE SHOCKING**\n\n2015:\nLil Yachty makes his first and second release, SPY senses the releases coming the day before and drops in response. However, SPY resists yachty\u2019s influence for the days following either of his two 2015 releases. Yachty\u2019s influence over SPY at this time is tangible but not fully realized.\n\nAugust 22 EP *Summer Songs* released\n\nAugust 21 SPY | open:201.73 | close:197.83\n\nDec. 25 EP *Hey Honey Let's Spend Wintertime On a Boat* released\n\nDecember 24 SPY | open:205.72 | close:205.68\n\n2016:\n\nMarch 9th mixtape *Lil Boat* released\n\nMarch 10th SPY | open:199.96 | close:199.54\n\nJuly 20th mixtape *Summer Songs 2* released\n\nJuly 21st SPY | open:216.96 | close:216.27\n\nAugust 2 EP *Big Boat* released\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;August 2 SPY: open:216.65/close:215.55\n\nAugust 30 EP *Lost Files* released\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;August 30 SPY: open:218.26/close:218.00\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;August 31 SPY: open:217.61/close:217.38\n\n2017:\n\nMay 26 album *Teenage Emotions* released\n\nSPY only decreased one day out of the next five of the following week, and resulted in a $2 increase in 30 days time June 26. So not a significant drop but also not a huge increase. \n\n2018:\n\nMarch 9 album *Lil Boat 2* released on a Friday\nFollowing week shows a drop in SPY every day for a total drop of 5 by EOW.\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;March 12 SPY: open:279.20/close:278.52\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;March 13 SPY: open:279.84/close:276.72\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;March 14 SPY: open:277.81/close:275.30\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;March 15 SPY: open:275.88/close:275.00\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;March 16 SPY: open:274.50/close:274.2x\n\n3/9-4/6 SPY dropped 20 to 259.72 EOD.\n\nAugust 23 EP *Birthday Mix* released\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;August 23 SPY: open:285.97/285.79\n\nOctober 19 album *Nuthin\u2019 2 Prove* released on a Friday\n\nFollowing week shows a drop in SPY every other day next week for a total drop of 11.67 by EOW.\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;October 22 SPY: open:277.0/close:275.01\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;October 24 SPY: open:273.33/close:265.32\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;October 26 SPY: open:265.92/close:265.33\n\n2020:\n\nFebruary 28 mixtape *A-Team* released\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;February 28 SPY open:288.70/close:296.26\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;March 23 SPY open:228.19/close/:222.95\n\nThe week of 3/2-6 showed some price fluctuation but EOW SPY drops 3. The following weeks SPY drops to below 240.\n\nAlbum *Lil Boat 3* Releasing sometime this year, probably soon. Yachty tweeted recently:\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; 4/30: Damnnn I\u2019m ready 2 drop \n\n**Conclusions**\n\nLil Yachty has released 11 different major releases to date. 3 mixtapes, 3 albums, and 5 EPs. Another album is set to be released this year, probably soon. Out of these 11 releases, only one has resulted in no SPY drops EOD, EOW or EOM. While not every one of these 10 music releases shares identical percentage drops or days where the drops happen.\n\nHere are some patterns that have emerged to mine own retard eye:\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;90% confidence in the Yachty indicator according to results. 10/11 releases has resulted in SPY drops.\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Lil Yachty EP releases result in a drop in SPY on the day of or the day before a release, but not after. \n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;I don\u2019t see any meaningful patterns among the mixtapes or albums. \n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;It appears as if the efficiency and power of Yachty\u2019s releases is directly related to the length of time with which he has made music. The closer we get to the present date, the stronger the effect a Yachty release has on the market. \n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;I don\u2019t know if this looks like a bell curve and the effects will only get weaker from here or if we\u2019re nearing the top of the curve, or if his energy is so powerful it has autistic linear strength that will only increase in time to the point that the fed discover this and order him suicided by two bullets to the back of the head.\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;The effects of the 2/28/20 mixtape on the retard market of March 2020 was a key part in the full retard drops experienced. IM NOT SAYING LIL YACHTY IS MAKING THE STONKS DROP. I\u2019m saying that there is a positive correlation between Yachty\u2019s release of music and stonks dropping. \n\nAs a result of this DD and the following one I will do on Gordon the Gecko, I\u2019m a huge bull turned \ud83d\udc3b\ud83c\udf08 for the coming month. \n\n*Do you still have any doubt that this Yachty thing is real?\n\nu/DoloresTargaryen posted in a comment in response to my own in reference to this theory\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;well of course this is a thing, yachty is one of us. he has a famous lyric:\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;she blow that dick like cello\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;and in response to this obviously retarded line, he said:\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;I guess for a second, I thought a cello was a woodwind instrument and it is not. And nobody ever said shit. Nobody ever pulled up a pic and said, \u201cHey man. I don\u2019t know if you know what this is, but it ain\u2019t that.\u201d I fucked up. I thought Squidward played the cello. He don\u2019t. That\u2019s a flute. I fucked up. But it do sound good\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;He channels pure autistic energy.\n\nTL;DR: When Lil Yachty releases music, SPY almost always drops. \n\nTL;DR for the super autists who ask for a position:\n**JUST BUY SPY PUTS FOR MARCH AND BE A \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b**", "created_utc": 1588448832.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gcclhg/the_nostradamus_of_spy_the_lil_yachty_prophecy/", "is_self": true}
