{"id": "dpdi9o", "title": "BYND: Is it like TSLA or TLRY?", "selftext": "I posted this on r/options first, thinking they would have helpful input but after waiting a whole 2 hours I got nothing. \n\nI have been short (via puts) on BYND since mid-August. My positions are May 2020 105p, 12/20 100p, 11/15 72.5p, and December 2020 42.5p. I bought in at different times and have rolled positions over this time. I have roughly 10% of my total account on this trade. I am currently up roughly 75% overall after today's drop.\n\nMy original thesis was that once the lock up ended there would be too many shares outstanding to hold its ridiculous valuation. I felt vindicated yesterday but with today's huge spike I am now questioning if the thesis has been broken. Hyped stocks like BYND are difficult to figure out. Do you think this is a TSLA situation where the ridiculously high valuation is here to stay or a TLRY situation where there will be a continued, epic downfall? Just curious to hear your opinions or if anyone else is in on the trade?", "created_utc": 1572472262, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpdi9o/bynd_is_it_like_tsla_or_tlry/", "is_self": true}
