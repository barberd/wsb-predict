How exactly did you get your application approved?", "selftext": "So I've had this account for 8 years and it has $10k in it but they won't even approve me for Level 1 options trading. I've submitted the application twice. There's never been anything sketchy done with my account besides investing in 3D printing hard a few years ago (though DDD and ONVO are way up lately, thank the almighty goodness being). You people act like Robbinhood gives you full option trading for having a pulse. Is it time to make the switch? I thought I'd stay with Etrade now that they have free trades, but I'm getting sick of going long on everything. I wanna lose some real money and I've got a hunch TSLA is going straight to 1000.", "created_utc": 1579627552, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/erxw96/do_any_of_you_fine_autists_have_options_trading/", "is_self": true}
