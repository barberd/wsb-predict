As technology advances, sure there\u2019s distributors/pioneers but nothing really stops competitors in the long run from making markets that don\u2019t have inherent moats from operating competitively. (aka no more insane market share taking, intel fucking story) \n\nwill amd have some kinda contracts to keep their chips and only theirs in certain tech products?\n\ndo they have some unfuckable patents that even harvey spector won\u2019t fuck?\n\n(posting here cuz u special needs fuckers seem to know more about AMD than any other sub)", "created_utc": 1577654556, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ehbqnt/dumbass_amd_question/", "is_self": true}
