This is literally the TSLA of gambling.\n\n\nThe DraftKings/$DEAC merger(IPO turning $DEAC into $DRAFT) is happening in the first half of 2020. Get on the boat early. It\u2019s only going up from here.\n\nDraftKings is guaranteed money since they make the margins on the bets people can place. It\u2019s literally free money for them, which translates to free money for us. \n\nWe\u2019re a bunch of autists who only gamble, so why not gamble on gambling./s", "created_utc": 1582176460, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6oagf/spce_is_old_news_deac_will_give_you_all_the/", "is_self": true}
