TSLA always dumps EOD on a Friday so I'll be looking for around $5k minimum from my TSLA plays today!   \n\n\nWill be buying TSLA calls closer to space x astronauts returning and MSFT calls when it dips to 190 on Monday.  \n\n\nI'll sell the TSLA calls one the astronauts have returned (on the pump) and sell the MSFT calls on earnings day!   \n\n\nDo your own research and have fun trading, don't use what you can't afford to lose! Marathon, not a sprint.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ytcxwv3g2w551.png?width=1846&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bbe7e2f522324ac7f5a3db0aea7b1a20242e3c4", "created_utc": 1592582013.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hc35fx/30k_daytrade_tsla_yolo/", "is_self": true}
