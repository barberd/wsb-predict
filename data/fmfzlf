I think he should really let the scientist and doctors decide if this works and not push some potential snake oil on everyone.\n\nThe hyped up [study](https://www.mediterranee-infection.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Hydroxychloroquine_final_DOI_IJAA.pdf) they did in France on Hydroxychloroquine has all sorts of problems. First, n=20. Then what was or is actually measured there? In this context, it is of particular importance that the Marseille study based on the measurement of viral load in the nasopharynx is not a randomised double-blind study with only 20 volunteers. Whether young or old, with or without symptoms, whether slightly, severely or not at all ill or cured in the meantime: The study was carried out as the patients came in. Thus, the basis of any professional statistical survey is not given. Also 3 patients started the trial, then got worse, were moved to ICU and died. They were removed from the sample. \n\nSince the virus load was measured in the nasopharynx and not in the lungs, there is a high risk of further misinterpretations. Because what the patient has in his throat has nothing to do with how the disease progresses clinically. Maybe chloroquine does work. But the way this study was done, we're not one bit smarter.\n\nSide effects, u/Iidentifyasabear shared his personal story in the [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmfzlf/dd_on_hydroxychloroquine_and_why_it_might_all_be/fl4312d/?context=3).
