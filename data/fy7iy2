Seemed entertaining at the least.\n\nThe animated GIFs are something for the history books, I fucking love it. Worth putting up with the bullshit y\u2019all post 1/2 the time. \n\nHowever I recently started feeling bad for the 90% of y\u2019all losing money on a daily basis. \n\nSo now I\u2019ve been drinking for a long while and trolling WSB on multiple accounts like a true autist psychopath. \n\nI thought at first, \u201cdamn these retards are on point\u201d \n\nNow I\u2019m like... \u201cDoes ANYONE here play weekly or daily\u2019s?\u201d \n\nWhat the hell is wrong with all you \ud83c\udf08 \ud83d\udc3b\u2019s?\n\nThe loss porn is deplorable. \n\nDiamond hands I guess, but if you sold and rebought you\u2019d be in a better place rn, no?\n\nCan you derelicts read a chart? \n\nHow is anyone here even trading options? (Fuck RH)\n\nIt feels like everyone watched \u201cThe Big Short\u201d\nAnd decided this was their get rich quick scheme.\n\nHow old are some of you ignorant meat wads?\n\nThis shit takes time. Too many variables at play.\nDaily, and weekly trades ftw.\n\nI thought I\u2019d get insight by joining here, I did.\nDon\u2019t listen to the idiots.\n\nMorons here are going yolo with parents money they didn\u2019t earn on stupid lottos they can\u2019t predict.\n\nReal artists are doing their bidding silently, you won\u2019t find many clean trades here anymore.\n(I\u2019m only posting because of the alcohol)\n\nTLDR/\nStop listening to anyone and learn to read a chart and proper research.\n Small postions. smart trades.\n\nPostions: \nTAL 50p 4/17\nGE 25c 1/22\n\nLong: mezcal \n\nDo your DD.", "created_utc": 1586489964.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fy7iy2/so_whats_the_deal_with_wsb/", "is_self": true}
