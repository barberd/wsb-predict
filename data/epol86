{"id": "epol86", "title": "SBUX Calls", "selftext": "A week ago, I mentioned the SBUX $95 Calls 2/21 as a great buy at 0.95. They are currently looking nice. \n\nI've since dug a little deeper into SBUX to get a better outlook of what we might expect to hear for ER and guidance. \n\nAs of now, SBUX owns about 10% of the coffee market. The numbers are even more staggering at nearly 40% of the market in the U.S alone. In 2019, Starbucks made a huge expansion of 2000+ locations, situating this franchise in more than 33,000 locations across the globe. Recently, their former CEO also announced plans to expand 100 community Starbucks stores by 2025 in specific low-income communities and hire locally. That's going to be great PR.\n\nAs of late, we can also see that Starbucks is also rising steadily from sub 90 to currently 92+ some change.  Earnings will be coming up, and we would likely beat EPS estimates but not my large margins as the additional revenue from the added locations will not take full effect until 1-2 years after it's establishment. But that means guidance will look strong coming into the rest of 2020. \n\nNot to mention, coffee is a staple for most, and the market that SBUX is aiming towards is diverse. \n\nI'm looking to add a few more $90/92.50 for March 20 expiration. Will be looking forward to ER and hopefully an 8 point increase in the coming month to get us back at the 52 year high. Charts are also looking strong with huge support at $90 and a building green candle coming off of the $90.50 area. As Trump would say, \"things are looking great\". \"very nice\". \"Make Starbucks Great Again\"", "created_utc": 1579204591, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/epol86/sbux_calls/", "is_self": true}
