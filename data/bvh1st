{"id": "bvh1st", "title": "GME earnings is a bear trap", "selftext": "I usually don't make ER predictions or play with options but this one is screaming at me as an obvious \"what goes down must come up\" autism play.\n\nLook at how far this stock has fallen. Fundamentally the valuation is now extraordinarily cheap, it is trading below net cash. Technically this cash is necessary to stock up on inventory before the busier quarters in the second half of the year, and therefore, but, this doesn't change the fact that the business could be liquidated tomorrow probably at a net gain to the shareholders.\n\nManagement desperately wants the stock to rise. Putting myself on a limb here to sound like an idiot later, but why the fuck would they cut the dividend if it's essentially the only attractive thing about the stock? Where is their magic wand to put that money to good use? They are divesting, not investing. \n\nI think:\n\n1. This stock is fundamentally undervalued and can say this with confidence\n\n2. the dividend probably does not get cut as there is no good alternate use for the funds\n\n3.  This stock goes back to $9 in the weeks after ER.\n\nTakeaway is to look at calls that expire a few weeks after ER. If they are rising in value(expected move) before ER, then do not play with the options but consider an equity earnings play -- low risk, solid reward. If they are falling in value before ER, buy calls on the panic.", "created_utc": 1559363334, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bvh1st/gme_earnings_is_a_bear_trap/", "is_self": true}
