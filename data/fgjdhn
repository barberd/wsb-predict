{"id": "fgjdhn", "title": "Biogen\u2019s Nightmare Conference", "selftext": "So as of now, there are 32 Biogen employes in Massachusetts that have been confirmed to have the coronavirus. This all said to be related to a Biogen conference that took place in Boston were 175 employees attended the management meeting. In another Biogen location (Raleigh NC) 5 workers were confirmed to have the coronavirus that also went to the same conference. Reports are that some of those employees worked for a couple of days in the Raleigh NC Biogen office before realizing that they had the virus, I\u2019d imagine this is true for the Massachusetts office too. North Carolina just issued a state of emergency due to the coronavirus and 6/7 of the cases in NC are directly related to Biogen. \nBiogen is a biotechnology company specializing in the discovery, development, and delivery of therapies for the treatment of neurological diseases to patients worldwide. \nThis is NOT a good look for a medical company to have 1/16 of the cases in the US be related to its employees. I bet there\u2019s going to be more employees that test positive in the near future as well. So far most of the coverage of this looks to be from local news organizations near those offices. Given this is a medical company, I could see this further impacting $BIIB once bigger news organizations realize the percent of US coronavirus cases related to Biogen.\n\nhttps://www.bostonherald.com/2020/03/09/biogens-boston-conference-continues-to-be-leading-source-of-coronavirus-cases/amp/", "created_utc": 1583868230.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fgjdhn/biogens_nightmare_conference/", "is_self": true}
