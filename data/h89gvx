So i hope this makes it through.\n\n*GME - Everybody's favorite stock to hate, that will literally triple into EOY*\n\n**Financials**\n\n* $570 Million in Cash\n* Q2 Projections of $575 - $625 Million\n* $419 Million in debt ( 2021 Maturity )  has been resolved with a new debt exchange offer ( 2023 Maturity ) aka no risk of bankruptcy\n* Market Cap 300 Million ( approx. **1/2 book value** )\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Who buys expensive video games in a Recession? Everyone.**\n\n* The previous record for video game sales was set in March 2008 ( 1.8 Billion ) with the [March 2020 figures coming in at  ( 1.6 Billion )](https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/2020/first-quarter-2020-sales-of-us-video-games-boosted-by-strong-march-performance-according-to-the-npd-group/) with [April raking in ( 1.5 Billion )](https://twitter.com/MatPiscatella/status/1263816799721631745)\n* This illustrates a demand for video games, not only in a recession, but also in a quarantine/stay at home environment\n* PS5 was just revealed Thursday 6/11 - and the New Xbox is set to debut soon as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"Console Cycles\" and Their Effect on Price**\n\n[Heres a look at 2013 and the release of the Xbox One and PS4.](https://imgur.com/tK3AEol)\n\n* The hype/pricing in begins End of May and Continues right up until the console releases ( Oct/Nov )\n* GME back in 2013 was booming, and definitely not priced at less than half of its book value.\n* This years pop should outpace its previous 80% gain in 2013\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Digital Consoles making GME Irrelevant**\n\n* Digital games cannot be gifted. Think of a kids bday party - these mf's are getting nothing but $65 games left and right.

SNE/MSFT/Nintendo see them as a valuable asset to distribute their products to a loyal, and long standing audience.\n* If GME were to go tits up, SNE/MSFT/Nintendo would have to negotiate with big box retailers such as TGT, AMZN, BBY who are not solely dedicated to Video Games. Resulting in decrease margins.\n* GME is actually testing \"digital revenue sharing\" with the 3 large producers, although they havent outlined what the details of this is - its easy to see theyre working together.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have over 250 6/26 Calls that i am bagholding for this all too elusive short squeeze, but this post isnt about technicals, but rather fundamentals, and demand in the current economic environment.\n\nFor the reasons above im going to begin building a not-so-sexy 10/16 Call Position.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:**\n\n* **GME $5C 10/16**\n* **GME $6C 10/16**\n* **GME $7C 10/16**", "created_utc": 1592061687.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h89gvx/gme_gang_still_ridin_the_dd/", "is_self": true}
