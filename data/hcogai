However, there isn't a reason in the world I can find to think that AMZN is ultimately one of the stocks that will crash when the bubble bursts.\n\nWho gives a shit if the fed is inflating the market with liquidity when their sales have gone up? Who gives a shit if commercial real estate is delinquent when they are the ones buying it up? Bezos is going to do what Bezos has always done which is use this incredible opportunity the world has given him to consume new enormous markets.\n\nAWS makes up like 40% of AMZN's overall value and it has a 19% operating margin. Everyone looking to take advantage of this way of life change to expand into the digital marketplace and provide remote working options will be hosting the tech on their cloud computing platform. They have had a monopoly on this for years, because of how superior their platform is.\n\nWill there be some dips as people sell off? Yeah, but they won't make a dent in it's big picture trajectory and you can't predict them with a Yahoo Finance account. I'll be able to sell my shares at $5000 eventually and make back my losses from my stupid speculative shit. Everyone else is just operating off some speculative possibility that it's not be valued correctly.", "created_utc": 1592668099.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hcogai/if_you_are_shorting_amznwhy/", "is_self": true}
