Since then, it has grown alongside the rest of the market. Square will face very little growth for the foreseeable future, but can be a great candidate for covered calls.\n\n**Technical**: Priced below 20, 50, 200 day moving average. MACD slight shows bullish convergence. RSI shows around 40, coming up from oversold. Options sentiments are bullish in volume and Bearish open interest. Implied movement is a whopping 12.1% or about 5.85$ Short interest is at 7.83%, with 5.2 days to cover. Support at \\~41$, with 52w high being 87.25$.\n\n**Sentimental**: Square is a company that will not die. While the valuation was rich, Square was primely in the growth category, with its consistent revenue and EPS increases. The current coronavirus selloff has affected every stock on the market and Square was no exception. In addition, the recent purchase of Honey, alongside essentially halted SMBs, leaves SQ exposed to large risks. Analyst revisions have been entirely negative, as the outlook looks very grim. \n\nTypically in an elevated IV environment, sell-side earnings play becomes less effective. In addition, because of the current volatile macro environment, the binary event\u2019s sway over price points becomes mitigated as well, making earnings movement even less predictable. **I believe the bottom line here is if SQ moves against you, it can be beneficial long term to absorb the shares and sell covered calls as a way to generate cash-flow**. While this leaves many smaller trades on the sidelines, extraordinary times and risk management dictates safer plays. \n\n**Sell** \n\n**SQ - 4/03 $40 Puts**\n\n**4 of 5, Highly risky**", "created_utc": 1585067576.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fo83ho/square_sq_3242020_amc_need_to_be_patient/", "is_self": true}
