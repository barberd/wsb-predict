{"id": "fanm7x", "title": "Novice investing advice", "selftext": "Hello all! I have just recently started getting into investing. Nothing crazy, $20 here, $15 there, etc. I have diversified my portfolio into many different companies in different sectors. Obviously, this stock market crash isn't really doing anyone good. But for a newbie like me, it's a great time to buy.\n\nI am in a bit of a dilemma. I bought 2 stocks in companies which I do not really have a lot of faith in. Nobile energy (NBL) and Canopy Growth Stock (CGC). I bought NBL at 18.75 and CGC at 21.96. I own 1 share of each. I know this is such a trivial amount, but for someone who works hard everyday and invests a small portion of it into investment, it's quite a bit.\n\nI was wondering if I should just cut my losses and sell NBL when it bounces back up to the resistance level tomorrow and same with CGC. My prediction is that it would be $15.59 (NBL) and $18.60-18.70 (CGC)? Should I just cut my losses essentially and take the small $6-7 loss as opposed to losing almost $25-30 when I feel like the inevitable happens and they keep crashing even further tomorrow?", "created_utc": 1582857176, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fanm7x/novice_investing_advice/", "is_self": true}
