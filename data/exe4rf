Viruses arr able to mask their presence and replicate before your body even knows something is up. More viruses means more mutations. Mutations are the dangerous things. \n\n\nThe Corona virus is that, a virus. So that means you cannot kill it with an antibiotic. Once you have the virus that is it. Either you fight it off or you die.\n\n\nWith that in mind, old people and young people are susceptible to this virus with their week or compromised immune system. It is a matter of time until somebody in the United States dies from it.\u00a0\n\n\nThe virus is thought to be from either a bat, a snake, or both. The both is where you want to focus. If both, that means this virus is pretty good at mutating in order to host jump. It didn't just go from mammal to mammal, it went from mammal, to reptile, then to mammal again.\u00a0\n\n\nThe virus is transferable through droplets. A sneeze, a cough, the little speckles of spit that go into the air when you talk, any droplets can transfer this virus. It is like tuberculosis. If I can get tuberculosis with a mask, gown, and gloves on... You can get get Corona from going anywhere in public.\u00a0\n\n\nOnce it hits a city it's going to spread quick. It doesn't matter if it kills a single person it will scare enough people that it's in a big city they will pull their money out of the market. But once it kills one person in the United States/Canada or Europe that is not Chinese, the market is going to tank.\n\n\nBesides all that stuff, you might ask why Corona is such a big deal. The flu has killed more people this year, of course\u2026 The flu does not transfer from species to species. That's the biggest problem here. A virus that can mutate so rapidly and survive in different species is a bigger problem than the CDC, the world health organization, or China is letting on. It is only a matter of time until one country bans travel to and from China.\n\n\nTldr: Buy puts. It's going to take longer than 2 weeks to find a vaccine that works. Until then prices are going down for at least another week or two before they show signs of life.\u00a0", "created_utc": 1580597598, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/exe4rf/corona_biology_lesson_get_in_here_retards/", "is_self": true}
