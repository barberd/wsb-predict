{"id": "er96lj", "title": "A quick thank you to this autistic and flawed community", "selftext": "A couple years ago, I was a transitioning veteran that had no long term monetary plans in place. I was often living paycheck to paycheck, trying to make ends meet. A part of me thought that this fiscal situation was the norm for one\u2019s mid twenties. But then I discovered this sub and slowly, my mindset and drive to better myself changed. \n\nLast week, on January 13th, after dabbling in options for half a year and making a few thousand dollars, I decided on a whim to YOLO everything I had in my RH account into $TSLA and $BYND based on shitty DD from you sketchy fucks. I made $30,000.\n\nMy life has literally changed overnight. Where I was checking my bank account once or twice a day out of anxiety a few years ago, today I walked into Louis Vuitton and spent a few thousand dollars on my fianc\u00e9e. She\u2019s wanted a real Neverfull handbag from LV all of her adult life... and with this whole new world WSB has helped me reach off of options, I wanted to share the wealth with my better half.\n\nThe crazy part... I didn\u2019t feel bad about dropping that cash on material shit at all. I\u2019ve never felt this level of financial security before. And I owe it all to you fucks with the extra chromosomes. \n\nThank you.", "created_utc": 1579500711, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/er96lj/a_quick_thank_you_to_this_autistic_and_flawed/", "is_self": true}
