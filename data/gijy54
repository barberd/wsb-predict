The same goes for an injured economy: How long will it take to recover? Probably years.\n\nEconomists were hoping for a V-shaped economic recovery: a rapid slide down followed by a quick climb back. But many are scaling expectations back to a Nike swoosh-shaped recovery in which output may not return to pre-pandemic levels until late 2021 (or later). Even worse would be a W-shaped recovery, where the economy weathers one recession only to faceplant into a second. \u201cIf a second downturn were to flare up, it\u2019s far from clear that Congress would be ready to offer trillions more to enable businesses to survive yet another round of months-long shutdowns,\u201d the AP reports.  \n\n81% of small businesses think COVID-19 could impact them for 12\u201316 months. By some estimates, half of small businesses could fold within six, and laid off workers could require years to find new roles. More businesses are moving to permanent layoffs as they close factories and reduce operations. Manufacturing, which never returned to pre-2008 levels, is especially vulnerable. Between 2010 and 2019, the sector added 1.4 million jobs. In April, it lost 1.3 million (including temporary layoffs). The Becker Friedman Institute predicts that 42% of the layoffs will be permanent. Business closures also have upstream effects. Commercial real estate owners are expected to swallow big losses, then pass those up to banks when they can\u2019t make debt payments, which could push banks into failure. \n\nA recession\u2019s full effects can take years to ripple out. The Great Recession technically ended in June 2009, yet bank failures peaked in 2010. And as late as 2013, state and local governments were still slashing jobs.\n\nOf course, one wouldn't know any of this by looking at the stock market! What are your thoughts about it?\n\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/why-the-economic-recovery-will-be-more-of-a-swoosh-than-v-shaped-11589203608?mod=hp_lead_pos1&utm_source=morning_brew\n\nhttps://apnews.com/adab99c1d674ea016630103b4a66f5e8?utm_source=morning_brew\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-business/over-80-of-u-s-small-businesses-expect-longer-impact-of-pandemic-survey-idUSKBN22N1AV?utm_source=morning_brew\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/factories-close-for-good-as-coronavirus-cuts-demand-11589122800?utm_source=morning_brew\n\nhttps://qz.com/1855033/furloughs-become-layoffs-tempering-coronavirus-economic-recovery/?utm_source=morning_brew\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/11/upshot/virus-lasting-economic-effects.html?utm_source=morning_brew", "created_utc": 1589316152.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gijy54/economy_and_stocks_the_long_recovery_ahead/", "is_self": true}
