Two very positive news catalysts have raised them from the fucking dirt. \n\nI think they've always had this WeWork-esque hype about them, mainly because of their potential market but, past things like lawsuits, profitability, and butting heads with orthodontists were among the reasons why their stock got dicked down. \n\nTheir recent price movement has been ridiculous (49% in two days). The walmart deal, announcement to sell directly to dentists, and settlement of a lot of their legal troubles have raised a lot of peoples hopes about their eventual profitability.\n\nWhile recent news has made some very bullish, $SDC's shaky history and steep climb has given a huge incentive for people to short them. 21% of their float has been shorted. A squeeze seems very possible. \n\nCalls seems like a decent play right now, just be careful.", "created_utc": 1579210778, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/epq2yu/sdc_tendies/", "is_self": true}
