Don't buy puts. I repeat DON'T BUY PUTS. \n\nMost of you retards learnt their lesson when you got fucked post March, but fuck, some of you gay bears just won't quit. You'll post elaborate DDs on why we should short SPY and go long on VIX blaming fucking TQQQ and the other leveraged funds. \n\nSave your money to buy rent for your wife's boyfriend. A friend of mine used to yell SPY puts for life till one month back.
