My first position opened for BYND was a $115c June 21, opened on 5/21. Closed that shit as soon as market opened today, because I was positive that if I didn't then BYND would drop like a rock and I would be left holding my nut bag. Immediately opened up another call position with a portion of the profits, because this short squeeze might not be over yet, and FOMO. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHeld my $135c 6/7 FD until about 5 minutes before market close, as soon as I could after that peak turned around. Since I was heavily weighted towards the call side at this point, I opened up the 6/14 $120p as a hedge. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo in case everyone is wondering, I will be losing these gains next week while BYND trades range bound between 120 and 150.", "created_utc": 1559939264, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bxzexq/bynd_gains_in_my_roth_ira_lets_keep_it_rolling/", "is_self": true}
