{"id": "gbr5ln", "title": "This Weeks Market News & Events (04/26-05/01)", "selftext": "I do write ups through out the week of current new and events affecting the market and trends. I summarize from multiple sources, if there's any glaring errors blame CNBC and Bloomberg.   \n\n\n**04/26 Bank Of Japan Stimulus -** The bank of Japan (BOJ) will be having a meeting 04/26 to discuss further stimulus for the Japanese economy and is expected to remove buying limits of government bonds, and increase purchases of commercial and corporate debt. Though it should be noted that Japanese corporations are considered to be better positioned to weather the shut down, compared to corporations in other countries. This is due in large part to the high amount of cash reserves Japanese corporations keep on hand. It is currently estimated that Japanese corporations have $4.8 trillion of cash in their reserves. This places them in an excellent position to not only maintain operations, but also make future financial investments during this downturn. In addition, a record amount of publicly traded companies have chosen to suspend dividend payments until the economy reopens. A loan program is said to be on the table as well for companies who are struggling with cash flow.\n\n**04/26 Deficit and Spending**\\- The US budget deficit is expected to increase to 3.7trillion for this period as US spending rises fighting the coronavirus while the economy contracts. The previously projected budget deficit for 2020 was 1.083 trillion. Since the start of the lockdowns in the US, GDP is believed to have contracted 3.9% for the first quarter and possibly as much as 40% for the second quarter.\n\nSteve Mnuchin on Sunday stated that we were \u201cIn a War\u201d and that \u201cEverything that needs to be done to support the economy will be done\u201d. He was encouraged by the fact that interest rates remain low between 0-.25% in the US, and believes that the US economy will \u201c...really bounce back in July, August, and September.\u201d\n\nMany economists remain concerned about the rising level of US debt, as treasury bond rates remain at record lows, worried that investor interest may wane on Treasury bonds. The current rate on the 10 year yield is .6%, 4X lower than it was a year ago when the yield was at 2.5%. Although, there has been an uptick in foreign interest for US Treasury bonds throughout Europe and Japan as they have seen their interest rates drop to negative levels. China is currently the largest buyer of US treasury bonds, and owns the largest amount of US debt measured at approximately 5%(1.07 Trillion). Under negative interest rates, people and businesses would actually have to pay the banks to store their money rather than make any passive income from interest payments.\n\nEven before Covid19 shut down the US economy, massive spending has been a concern for many economists, as our spending has far outpaced economic growth since the last recession. Post 2009 Federal spending was kept between 2-3% as to not outpace the growth of the economy. During the Great Recession, spending on economic stimulus and overseas wars caused US spending to balloon to 24% of GDP, greatly adding to our debt at a much faster rate than previously. After the Great Recession spending was never reduced back to previous levels, instead the government began withdrawing funding from government funded organizations such as the military and medicare. A practice known as sequestering.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to know the full range of consequences that the US will face due to its additional massive spending combating Covid19 but it is generally agreed upon that eventually taxes will have to increase, and the US may face the possibility of another credit downgrade if our debt remains unchecked.  The US saw its first credit downgrade two years after the end of the Great Recession in 2011.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n04/27  **Oil Markets -** Oil had a rough Monday to start off the week. At the time of this writing June contracts for WTI are down 23% and trading at $13 a barrel. The popular oil index USO is also down 15% trading at $2.17. The two seem to be correlated as USO announces that they have begun offloading their June contracts out of fear those contracts would turn negative. The CME futures exchange has begun regulating the amount of contracts USO will be allowed to hold, warning them not to exceed their limits. This was done in an effort to prevent large unnecessary swings in the price of oil that do not reflect market conditions. Despite regulations supply still outpaces demand, and storage is also becoming an increasing worry for the oil producers. It is estimated about 85% of the world oils reserves are full at the moment. Producers are trying to come up with storage solutions by storing oil on tankers and possibly in pipelines as storage space disappears.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n04/28 **Food Chain and Earnings** \\- Trump intends to use the defense production act to keep food processing plants open to prevent disruptions in the food supply chain. Many processing plants have shut down, threatening to reduce the US meat processing capacity by 80%.\n\nA flood of loan applications continues to crash the SBA website as bankers attempt to submit many applications on behalf of their clients. After the initial $342 billion was loaned out in less than 2 weeks, an additional $310 billion was approved by congress to loan out to small businesses who were unable to receive aid during the first round of loans. It is predicted that the SBA will quickly loan out the additional $310 billion as well.\n\n$GOOG beat on revenue causing their share price to jump around 8% during AH to above despite seeing a decrease in their ad revenue. $F reported a loss of 2 Billion for the previous quarter and predicted rough times ahead for the auto-industry. Shares fell greater than 5% during AH. AMD, SBUX also reported earnings during after market close and were trading lower during the after hours session.\n\n$UBER announced after the market closed that they were planning on laying off 20% of their workforce. This is a little bit of speculation here, but I\u2019d imagine California, New York, and Las Vegas all contribute greatly to Uber's revenue. Seeing how New York and California have extended lock downs throughout May, and Las Vegas workers do not feel safe returning to work despite the mayor pushing them to do so, Ubers main markets have been hit the hardest and will be closed the longest giving Uber a very bleak outlook.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n04/29 **Gilead & The Fed -** Gilead was halted during pre-market trading hours while they made an announcement that their target goal had been achieved during their patient study for the drug remedesivir. This was a study including over a 1000 patients in multiple countries that showed patients on the drug recovered faster than those in the placebo group. Trump is now looking to the FDA to fast track the approval of the drug. $GILD ended the trading day 5% higher at $83.\n\nJerome Powell announced that the Fed will be keeping interest rates unchanged at 0-.25% and stated that interest rates will remain unchanged until he is confident the economy is nursed back to health. He stated that \u201cQ2 economic numbers will be the worst we\u2019ve seen in history\u201d and it will be a long recovery back to pre-covid 19 levels.\n\nMSFT, TSLA, FB all reported positive earnings after the bell causing their stock price to rise during after hours trading.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n04/30 **Unemployment & PMI** \\- Unemployment numbers were reported to be at 3.83M which is a decline from the previous reported number last week, bringing the total number of unemployed to above 30 million. The highest unemployment number reported thus far was 6.87 for the last week of March 28th, and has been in decline every week since. Chicago announced a PMI of 35.4 which was their lowest PMI number since 2009. The 10 year treasury note is trending downward back towards its all time low of .54%\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n04/30 **Trump & China -** Trump has stepped up his blame against China for the Corona Virus saying that they will face consequences for the damage it has caused. It is reported that possible sanctions, cancelling of US debt obligations, and new trade agreements were all being considered. This could potentially shake up investor confidence in a market that had previously rallied off of a trade agreement between the US and China earlier in the year.\n\nUS intelligence agencies are currently trying to determine if the virus had actually originated from the Wuhan Virology Center, and not the wet markets as China claims. Epidemiologist have thus far been unable to trace the virus back to a wet market adding to the suspicion that it was spread by an infected employee at the lab. Although it is important to note that scientists had determined Covid 19 was not man made, nor was it altered in a lab, often viruses are merely studied in Virology centers. Australia has also called out China and is asking for transparency and cooperation from the nation to determine the origins of the virus. China has responded by telling Australia they will \u201creduce economic cooperation with Australia\u201d if they continue to mount pressure against China.\n\nIn regards to repercussions against China, Mike Pompeo said \u201cTiming is important.\u201d Due to the fragile state of both economies, China could harm the US economy just as easily as we could harm theirs. In addition, the US & China have been sharing resources such as ventilators, testing equipment, and personal protective gear in an effort to regain control and fight Covid 19.\n\nAdding another layer of uncertainty to the world, Kim Jong-Un has yet to be seen since April 11th and many unconfirmed reports have come out about his health and possible location. There is some belief that Kim suffered a heart attack and is currently in a vegitative state and reports that Chinese medical team was dispatched to North Korea at some point during April. Other theories point to the leader simply being at one of his resorts likely hiding away from the public until the Covid 19 crisis is over. Although there has yet to be a single reported case of Covid 19 in North Korea.\n\n \\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n05/01 **Elon, Fannie Mae, PMI Oh My -** \u201cSell in May and Go Away\u201d proved true for the first of the month, as stocks sold off particularly hard due to reignited fears of Trump imposing tariffs on trade with China. Heading into the last hours of trading, all indexes are lower by greater than 2% with the Nasdaq down greater than 3%. PMI data for the month of April was also released this morning, ISM PMI was reported to be at 41.5 which is a decrease from March (49.1) indicating a further contraction of the economy. \n\nIn the mortgage market, there are about 3.8million mortgages in forbearance which accounts for nearly 8% of all US mortgages. This is equivalent to about 841 billion in unpaid principal. Fannie May believes this number could double in the coming months if the economy does not reopen and unemployment continues to rise. Out of all the Mortgage lenders, the Federal housing and Veterans administration had the highest level of homes in forbearance (10%) which doesn\u2019t come as too much of a shock as they offer loans to individuals with low credit scores and allow them to place a smaller down payment.\n\nAfter the market closed, the FDA granted emergency use authorization for the use of Remdesivir to treat Covid19 patients. Gilead has had a wild ride over the past two weeks due to conflicting information in their patient test trials, yet the general consensus at the moment is that Remdesivir has an obvious beneficial effects in treating Covid patients. \n\nJCrew joins the list of the companies expected to file for bankruptcy, and analysts believe many more bankruptcies will be on the way once liquidity starts drying up for more companies. TSLA which reported better than expected earnings this week, is obviously not going bankrupt, yet Elon oddly seemed to think their stock was over performing. After making comments today that the price of TSLA stock was too high, TSLA dropped from roughly $760 to a low of $686 before closing the day at $701 per share. For once, Elon seems to be on the side of the short sellers.", "created_utc": 1588369624.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gbr5ln/this_weeks_market_news_events_04260501/", "is_self": true}
