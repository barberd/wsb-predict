My opinion/advice:\n\nJapan's BOJ is around 100% of GDP, and I see no reason that the Fed couldn't pass 10,15, or even $20 trillion soon if they keep this act of printing money up. Don't take investing advice from me, but USD could be fucked.\n\nThis is not my area of expertise, can we get thoughts from actual economists?\n\nTL;DR: money printer go brrr", "created_utc": 1585125831.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fomy1g/fed_balance_sheet_reaching_all_time_highs/", "is_self": true}
