Not bad for holding 2 days.\nBreak even of 296.8 meant I was risking $7740 for max return of $3600. That seemed reasonable.\n\nIt hit about 61% of max profit while I was eating lunch, so I figure why not do the prudent thing and take some money off the table for once.\n\nI\u2019m short 16 x 290p that I\u2019ll let expire on Friday for another $2300.\n\nBelieve in theta, brothers, sisters, and everyone else. Believe!\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/OrnIvk1.jpg", "created_utc": 1578506057, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/elw5ut/midweek_theta_gang_update_on_aapl_2k_closed_so/", "is_self": true}
