Looking at the primecap VPMAX (a fund that has done  well for me over the years) 9/30 holdings report. Noticed a share holdings increase and a pathetic YTD return. \n\nFirst individual stock trade.  Historically have only invested in Mutual Funds/ETFs which can be a bit  boring. Decided to buy 200 RIG @ 4.90 a few weeks back just to dip my toes, and it is now up 25% which i thought was funny. \n\nGenius or Lucky? roast away", "created_utc": 1576260522, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ea7ibq/rig_trade_roast_my_research_methods/", "is_self": true}
