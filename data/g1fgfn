{"id": "g1fgfn", "title": "The Last Leg to Stand On - A Thought for Sir the McDonald's", "selftext": "As of recent, the market stood on three legs. Those holding the pillars were the believers of technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and sentimental analysis. These three group defy each other and like to believe the others' don't exist, so let's take a small overview.\n\n# Level 1 - The Tripod\n###Fundamental Analysis\n\nThe working-class of finance. Simply put a stock is worth what you're going to get from it (great).\n\nStarting with dividends - those little $0.50 things that you thought were your paychecks were actually a company's gift to you, the shareholder, for taking interest (read, ownership) in their company and stock.\n\nSimply put, without growth (cause growth can be ugly and doesn't fit in a nice little distributional box), a company's value is just all those dividends paid out today. Of course, since we like to believe that you can get 8% annualized for all eternity by just investing in the S&P (the real false theory, which should be shut down in a later DD) later dividends are worth less - given 1000 years and an assumption that money now equals more money later, then dividends paid out in 1000 years aren't paid out now. Much less 1001, and even less 1002. Point is that taking a company's dividends for all eternity (another assumption, companies can't fail) and bringing them to **now**, the stock price for all shares now and present, is a simple math problem.\n\nNow with growth, for non-dividend stocks. Actually, you're out of luck, since \"growth\" in the DDM, GGM, whatever model refers to dividend growth, and not company growth. So to value these stocks, you have to assume they're not paying dividends now, but *definitely* will sometimes in the future. When someone calls you out on it for stretching reality a bit, then you have to jump models just to value these (most) stocks.\n\n**TL;DR** - Math people try to make non-math into math. Where math doesn't work, don't throw away broken math - just use different math and forget the first one exists and is taught in every finance space. \n\n**TL;DR of TL;DR** - Garbage in, garbage out. \n\n###Technical Analysis\n\nThe mysticism of finance. Many prophets came from this sect of the religion. The Fundamentalists went on many crusades against the Technicalists in the last century. Much blood in the streets. For this reason it's not taught in school, even though opinion that [can't be disproved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis) is - when nobody of serious caliber has believed it in for the last four decades.\n\nI'm no expert in TA, and for that reason will end it here. Not going to bore you with 1/3 Fibonacci sequences retracing the half leg down in 1928. All we need to know is that price movement, and past price history is integral to technical analysis. Doesn't matter if the price in the past few months were inflated or not, it's the baseline (**important for later**).\n\n**TL;DR** - TA may be right, has been right, but our three giants of TA here have recently been proven wrong, and it's banned from schools, our own dark ages. At least they admit when they're wrong.\n\n###Sentiment analysis\n\nThis is the cult the Fundamentalists fear. Every time doctrine is taught in school one person out of ten raises their hand and asks - \"But why would stocks move to information that doesn't affect them?\". Sentiment analysis maintains the market *should* react to bad news. Whenever this works, consensus is \"duh\", when it doesn't, \"it's priced in\". It's the leg that traditional finance needs, but never accepts.\n\n**TL;DR** - Makes sense in theory (people will withdraw funds with negative emotion), when it doesn't work people shrug and rationalize it with \"didn't you know\". This leg has been more reliable *in aggregate* than the other two - but if you only hear bad news with everyone else, there's no way to benefit. Directly in contrast with the EMH - which, fun fact, contributed hard to the financial crisis.\n\n**TL;DR of TL;DR** - Markets should be rational with small blips in the long run. They should react with news accordingly.\n\n**TL;DR of TL;DR of TL;DR** - They don't.\n\n# Level 2 - The Broken \n\nSo the fed's printer's been running, shadow pools look ominous, we've just found out M(&)M's aren't just chocolate, and repo operations are still a mystery. What *do* we know? That the markets have been irrational to every leg of the tripod in the past 3 weeks.\n\nWe have two questions:\n\n1. How long can it remain broken?\n2. What happens when it becomes \"fixed\"?\n\nNobody has any idea how long it can remain broken. I don't know of a single way to tell, and nobody's offered DD trying to rationalize it, so that's that. Not going to discuss it.\n\nQuestion #2 is going to be the golden McNugget here.\n\n# Level 3 - Ponzi Scheme\n\nThe fix is a patch. Printing money in aggregate sounds wrong, propping up the market (however it's done) doesn't sound right, and everything points to the market going further and further from reality.\n\nBut it doesn't matter, does it.\n\nTwo of the three legs rely on appearances, not substance. Technical analysis doesn't care if the price over the past 5 months has been artificially inflated. It just finds where the testing points are, and that's set no matter *why* the previous price went up or down.\n\nSentiment analysis, weirdly enough, doesn't really care about *why* yesterday's price was what it was. It doesn't correct, it predicts movement - with the caveat that heavy growth stocks that are known to be growth stocks are part of the sentiment itself. Barring that, with good news, stocks should go up from demand, fall from oversupply. From where? Who cares.\n\nFundamental analysis is the only leg that tries to tell us, in isolation, what a specific stock's price should be. And unless you're a hardcore fundamentalist, in which case I got a lot of questions for you, the stock price today is only relative to the stock tomorrow. If fundamental analysis *does* rule, then by theory stocks less affected by the outbreak (T-Mobile, Verizon, Zoom, etc.) should not dip even according to the Fundamentalists.\n\nSo grab some cheap fast food and ponder - what happens when the printer stops? All signs point to better news than we've seen in recent weeks. The fix is a patch - but because this is the stock market, may just work.\n\n**You're trading stocks as an artificial currency.** There *is* no fundamental reason 300 is better than 200, and the farther out the IPO the more nobody cares. The S&P has grown 8% per year over time not because of inflation, not because of population growth, but because you believe in it, 327 million others do as well.\n\nExcept... they've found a way to bring it up. It's not propping up the stock price *now*, it's propping up the baseline for a belief system. They've drawn a bridge for the train to go over. It doesn't matter if there's water underneath.\n\n**TL;DR** - When life starts to go back to normal, they'll pick up where JPow left off. If JPow leaves off where the good news starts, one leg springs into three, and we continue like nothing happened.\n\n**TL;DR of TL;DR** - SPY 220 4/17\n\n# Level 4 - The Printer Itself\n\nThis wouldn't be complete without discussing what effect stopping the Fed's printer/whatever stimulus propping up the market will have on each of the 3 legs themselves.\n\n* **Fundamental Analysis** - The printer stops. A new rush for liquidity is the strongest counterpoint to the V-shape market. If this can go on for another month/two, then according to most studies we'll be seeing the light at the end of the COVID tunnel. I am not sure what % of volume now is up to the big guys, but if there is a dip due to this it should be short-lived.\n\n*  **Technical Analysis** - No effect here from stimulus stopping.\n\n* **Sentiment Analysis** - Headlines - *\"The printer has stopped\"*. Also headlines - *\"We're past the peak and Trump says America will open for business next week\"*. Who wins? I'll let you flip the coin.\n\n# Final Notes\n\nIf there's one thing they don't teach you in school, it's the the credibility of finance predictors are determined by the amount of people who believe in it. Sure, I called it a Ponzi scheme before - but if people believe resistance will happen at 278, it'll happen at 278. If institutional investors decide to sell or buy based on the profitability/liquidity/ other market ratios (doubt they do, but hey, it's a hypothetical), then traditional finance will be proven by power of belief.\n\nSo the next time you walk into a Wendy's, grab this with a grain of salt.\n\n**TL;DR** - SPY 220 4/17", "created_utc": 1586903584.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1fgfn/the_last_leg_to_stand_on_a_thought_for_sir_the/", "is_self": true}
