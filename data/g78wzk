{"id": "g78wzk", "title": "ACC Unusual Options Activity", "selftext": "We got another juicy one for you guys. Shoutout to u/chautist for bringing this to my attention. This one looks like a perfect setup, but as always, do your own DD and draw your own conclusions from the information.\n\n**TL,DR;** ACC 5/15 25p\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Fundamentals**\n\nACC is a REIT that primarily operates college living and dormitories across the United Sates. As you can tell, colleges are straight FUCKED with the type of beerflu that they don't want to have. Earnings was a couple days ago on 4/21, with them reporting lackluster Q1 results. The stock is down from it ATH of 50.94 and  the current trend is downwards. This will come in handy later\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Institutional Play**\n\nOn 4/23/2020, an institution made a large block order of 3450 put options with a buy at the ask. The Bid/Ask spread was .2 x .8 at the time, indicating that this was an extremely aggressive purchase. This is a long put, so \n\nUsually I would not consider 3450 a significant enough volume of options to trade on, but ACC is a smaller stock with an average daily volume of 1.4 million. This means that this position represents over 24% of the average daily volume, far surpassing my 10% significance threshold. Additionally, open interest on most of these contracts is less than 200, while you can see the 25p for 5/15 expiration  has an OI of over 4000, 3450 of which are the institution's. \n\nThe reason why I think this is a directional bet rather than a hedge is due to a convergence of a number of factors. \n\n* May 15th is the contract that expires the soonest (no weeklies), the contract was 18% OTM at the time of purchase\n* MMs became delta positive and sold off the stock (indicated by the sudden drop in price on the 1 minute chart at the time of purchase) at purchase \n* Sheer volume of options purchased. Hell, [this article here](https://newsheater.com/2020/04/23/american-campus-communities-inc-acc-loss-33-46-in-one-year-whats-next/) felt the need to mention that the 10,000 shares that an institution held was significant, while this mofo here bought options representing 345,000 shares.\n* No significant change in volume at the time of purchase, indicating this was a pure options play.\n* The reason why institutions make money while you guys (me included, 70,000 down from ATH) lose money is that they **don't bet against the trend.** 9 times out of 10, unless they have insider information, institutions will trade with the trend, and the current trend is downwards. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThis particular institution is making a big bet that ACC will experience a major downtrend in the next 3 weeks. Yes, I could be wrong and this could be a hedge or a synthetic long, but based on the converging factors I have mentioned above, I don't believe this is the case and rather this is a significant and highly unusual directional bet. I'm already in 10 contracts of the 5/15 25p and plan to scale in more as the day goes on.", "created_utc": 1587737011.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g78wzk/acc_unusual_options_activity/", "is_self": true}
