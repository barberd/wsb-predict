You've had all fall and winter to make fun of bears. \"Stonks only go up!\" you said.\n\nYou called bears \"sick\" for hoping more people die of the Coronavirus. You berated us every chance you got. Cheap shot after cheap shot every single day multiple paragraphs of you rubbing your shrunken balls on our sleeping faces.\n\nWell guess what? It's spring time. Bears are coming out of hibernation now any second. The first one just took a bite out of $TSLA. Go on. Look at that dip. We waited all day for you to get done and now we're coming for sloppy seconds. We're going to be running a train on TSLA all night and by open $TSLA will be worth as much as $ACB, another one of our victims.\n\nThink I'm joking? Go on and take a look at any long term graph of the big boy stocks. They're all down long term the last five years except the token ones like $AMD, which we let you have to fatten you up. You're like cattle to us and we're going to eat you up for breakfast.\n\nBears are the alpha males. You're done. $TSLA is done. It's gonna fall harder than investors during the great depression - remember that? That's the kind of damage we can do. What can you do? Buy some 2008 2nd hand boat from a retired boomer who chainsmoked on it while fucking girls half your age? Pathetic.\n\nSincerely,\nBEAR GANG BEAR GANG", "created_utc": 1580851216, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eyxawg/there_will_be_blood/", "is_self": true}
