That would be too fast for healthy economic growth. It would create inflation, a boom-bust cycle, and then a crash. His tax plan forecasts a 3 percent growth rate.\n\nTrump said he could continue to \"borrow knowing that if the economy crashed, you could make a deal. The U.S. will never default because you can print the money.\" These are the most dangerous statements Trump has ever uttered. The first one is a blatant falsehood. If the economy collapsed, there would be no one to make a deal with. It would send the dollar into a collapse. That would send the entire world into another Great Depression. Printing money would send the dollar back into decline. Interest rates would rise as creditors lost faith in U.S. Treasurys.\n\nThat would create a recession.
