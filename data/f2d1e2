Each DWAC (position out and position in) are charged $100. We will then advise you once the DWACs can be completed.  \n\n\nThe timing varies. In general, a cash exercise will be processed in 1-2 weeks from submission. A cashless exercise is generally completed within 1 week of submission.  \n\n\nIf you wish to exercise, please submit a ticket indicating the following:  \n\n\n1. Account  \n2. Number of warrants to exercise  \n3. Agree to the DWAC fees ($200)  \n\n\nRegards,  \nInteractive Brokers Client Services ''''\n\nSo from the reply SPCE warrants are cashless exericse which I believe means that you would get only the stock minus the exercise price , in SPCE case the exercise price is 11.5. here is the definition from stockwarrantshq  [https://www.stockwarrantshq.com/cashless-warrant-exercise-why-growth-companies-covet-your-cash/](https://www.stockwarrantshq.com/cashless-warrant-exercise-why-growth-companies-covet-your-cash/) \\- \n\n ''''A cashless warrant exercise is when a company, which would usually accept a warrant plus some amount of cash, the exercise price, in exchange for stock, instead accepts the warrant and no cash, in return for a smaller amount of stock.\n\nThe end result for the warrant holder is the same. And, it is beneficial to the warrant holder in that they do not have to put up additional cash to exercise. This can be very helpful if you hold a large number of warrants.'''\n\nExample:\n\n## Cashless Warrant Exercise\n\n'''''equation: X = Y(a-b) / a.\n\nWe\u2019ll use two different prices for *a*. Let\u2019s see what dilution looks like if the \u201cfair value\u201d price is $100 vs. $15. We\u2019ll also assume we have 1,000 warrants. And, that the warrant is exercisable for one share of common at an exercise price of $11.50.\n\nAt a price of $100 our equation would look like this:\n\nX = 1,000(100-11.50) / 100 or X = 885. So with the stock trading at an average price of $100 prior to redemption, we would receive 885 shares of common in a cashless exercise. Instead of 1,000 additional shares of common there are only 885. Dilution is 11.5% less than what it would have been with a normal exercise.''''\n\nConclusion: So, from what I see is that if you really want to exercise your warrants at least from IB is that you need to pay 2 hundred freedom bucks, wait for a week without trading and you get some stocks which is the stock price-the warrant exercise price. \n\nSo, warrants are similar to options, but for options u could actually get all of the stock instantly, where warrants u need some time + extra cash to actually exercise it which maybe bad if the stock go down and u cant do anything, but warrants has way fewer premium and you may even find arbitrage opportunities. Thus,\n\nWarrants:Good for long-term, buy inflexible, more time needed to get the stock and diluted\n\nOptions:Good for Yolos,short term and instant results", "created_utc": 1581447543, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f2d1e2/dicussion_on_buying_spce_warrants_vs_option_calls/", "is_self": true}
