{"id": "fw4va9", "title": "Foot Locker Short", "selftext": "**Foot Locker:**\n\nFoot Locker (\u201cFL\u201d or \u201cthe Company\u201d) is the largest specialty retailer for athletic footwear in North America and has benefited from secular trends towards more casual footwear and healthy lifestyle. The Company has 3,200 stores globally with \\~13mm square footage.  FL also has a very concentrated supply base with Nike representing 73% of revenue and the rest primarily coming from Adidas, Under Armour and a few other players.\n\nFoot Locker\u2019s largest supplier is Nike, with 73% of sales. Nike is increasingly trying to grow their direct to consumer business due to the higher margins, which puts it in direct conflict with Foot Locker. Foot Locker\u2019s key advantage vs  e-commerce is the exclusive inventory they have, which may slowly be evapo rated away as Nike attempts to use that inventory for their DTC business. In order to reach their 16Bn DTC goal by 2020, NKE needs to grow 20% per year, implying that there will be a lot of pressure to enhance and grow this business from management.\n\nFoot Locker\u2019s revenue growth has largely come from ASP increases as they have shrunk the store base. Foot Locker is also a mall-based retailer , facing general industry headwinds on mall traffic. While the Company has been able to succeed despite these headwinds, and remains a destination for many shoppers, there is only so much FL can do to maintain traffic and volume momentum going forward.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut here's my main thesis: Nobody is playing basketball right now. Sports are out of the question for a while even if we do decide to open back up. **We are looking at June possibly being the EARLIEST we can all get together and play with some sweaty balls.**\n\nTLDR: NOBODY WEARS SHOES IN THE FUCKIN HOUSE. IT's GOING TO BE A WHILE BEFORE WE CAN ALL GET AROUND AND PLAY WITH SWEATY BALLS. DIRECT TO CONSUMER PURCHASES FOR SHOES ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO HAPPEN THEN BUYING DIRECTLY FROM FOOTLOCKER.\n\n# Positions: $FL 5/15 17.5P", "created_utc": 1586200275.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fw4va9/foot_locker_short/", "is_self": true}
