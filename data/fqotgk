I probably have some of the players wrong on this, and this might all be nutso conspiracy, but I do have some belief in the underlying forces of what I am trying to describe here.\n\nu/Variation-Separate has added a lot to the discussion about the way the market behaves due to the action of large firms and market makers. I'm not an economist but I have done some research and in general just a whole lot of pondering on this matter and I think I've come to a logical conclusion. \n\nWhat V-S has said is that his strategy lies in finding what he believes large firms use to be consistently successful. What I am going to suggest is that while he may be correct that the strategies reflect the actions of these firms, the firms are not passive actors in this. It is much more helpful to look at these firms, not as investors like you or I, but as bookies. \n\n**Market Makers are Bookies**\n\nA bookie determines the odds of a given event by calculating the probability of every outcome, then subtracting their margin. What I am going to suggest shouldn't even be controversial, that MM's are essentially doing the exact same thing, and their margin is reflected in the Bid-Ask spread.  \n\n**Order Flow**\n\nAnyone who has done any research on trading platform's TOS knows that every trading platform for retail investors sells user order flow data to HFT firms. I'm not going to bother copy pasting sources here, a google search will turn this up for you immediately. This means that HFT know exactly where all the retail money is at any given time. From now on, I'm going to call this retail money, \"The cream\"\n\n**Financial Institutions and Derivatives**\nFinancial institutions hire market makers to trade their assets at the prices they want to see on them. From now on, I'm going to call this institutional money \"The milk\" The market maker needs these assets to literally make the market, these are massive sums of assets that form the backbone of everything. The market maker is beholden to these institutions because they make up the majority of their business. If the market maker spills the milk, heads are going to roll. \n\n**How Market Makers Ensure Success**\n\nA good market maker will make returns for their clients and themselves no matter what the conditions are. How can this even be possible when it is so easy to lose money on a bet? The answer, is they steal the cream.\n\nIt is no coincidence that massive drops in the market are preceded by every idiot getting a trading account and trying to get a piece of the market. This is the best indicator that the market is fat. When the market is fat, there is plenty of cream to take. They need retail to buy their milk for the price of cream. So how do they take it? Simple, by causing euphoria and panic. \n\nEver notice how most of the market movement occurs in AH trading, at times where the volume is the lowest? At low volume times it becomes easy to move the open up to 5% in either direction. This is a massive advantage for MM's. And yes, there are competing interests in this matter. Think of it like an auction.  What the real futures traders aren't bidding on isn't this or that stock or ETF, what they are bidding on is the price at open.\n\n**Then comes the Volume**\n\nThe first 10 minutes of open are a massive percentage of the overall volume of the market relative to time. After setting the open (Literally \"Making the Market\") HFT firms call out their bets when the derivatives markets open. Various funds and retail buys in at their prices more or less the rest of the day. Occasionally, some big event will cause high volume movement mid day, but that is really pretty rare. The open price really sets the first datapoint of two that are the most important to our bookies, the second of which, is the close.\n\n**The Closing Bell**\n\nThe last 10 minutes has become insane lately. Sometimes the last two candles of the day are more volume than the past couple of hours total. We saw this in a big way Friday. All the gains for the day were wiped out in 10 minutes. This was theft of the cream. Often, those last 10 minutes will push the market to Max Pain like clockwork also. Every day that doesn't end at max pain is spilled milk. \n\nMax Pain on 3/31 is nearly 285. Max Pain on 4/1 is 255. Use that information as you will. \n\n\n**What this all means to retail investors**\n\nThere's two kind of cream in this market now, your standard r/investing passive ETF people, and your highly leveraged /r/wallstreetbets people. In terms of hard cash, there is a lot more money in retail ETFs than there is in retail options (I haven't done any research on this but it is just common sense IMO, if anyone knows how to find this data I would love to see it). So the goal of any MM right now is to take as much cream as possible from this, and in order to do that they need to suck Passive people dry without losing their ass on options contracts. They have all the order flow plugged in already, their algos can just use that to figure out exactly where the market needs to be for this to happen. They will pass out the maximum amount of $ROPE possible. \n\n\nSo what do I think is going to happen? There are a ton of people following V-S. There are probably a literal fuckton of people following his rough strikes, all the way out til June. If I am a MM right now, and I'm doing market research, I'm looking at all these people and wondering how I fuck them over. V-S has already said that a move above 270 could mean we make it to 300. I already said Max Pain on 3-31 is ~285. If you wanted to squeeze as many options contracts as possible, who you know are using this DD, and ROPE as many as possible on 3-31, what do you think you would make sure we close at on Tuesday?\n\nThen surprise, Wednesday Max Pain is ~255! Holy fuck! Why is there such a difference there? Because these motherfuckers KNOW that you will sell your puts on Tuesday, and by Wednesday they can safely tip this cow and scare the fuck out of a shitload of passive investors. Now those fuckers can pull their 401k's TAX FREE for fucks' sake. They will have stolen all your money by then anyway, so the retail options market will be a whole lot weaker, then we can proceed as planned with the next leg down.\n\nMy 2c. \n\nSPY 243P 5/1, SPY 190P 5/1, BAC 18P 9/1, BKLN 20P 1/21", "created_utc": 1585417694.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqotgk/the_role_of_hft_in_setting_market_openclose_and/", "is_self": true}
