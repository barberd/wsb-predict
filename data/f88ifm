Insider transaction is -41% (source: finviz). The CEO has been converting Class B shares to Class A shares and selling them all in the open market. In the past 2 months the total proceeds from this were over $26M. The CEO still has 25M class B shares with long dated conversion dates. The CFO, CMO, CAO, CLO have all been selling shares in the open market as well as a Director. \n\nI bought some puts ahead of earnings as the stock went over 100. The 95P 3/6 look good.
