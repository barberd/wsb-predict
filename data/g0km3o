The best example I can give is this would give you a general idea to how Sbux was doing in a typical west coast environment.\n\nMost of the shops that I went to, I parked my car and counted number of cars coming in. \n\nFor the period of April 5 to 9, from 9 am to 5 on, I counted an average  of 140 cars per drove. I didn't go during the weekend.\n\nAverage order let's say is 10 dollars to be fair. I'm estimating roughly 1400 dollars a day.\n\nWhile going on the Starbucks subreddit, baristas were complaining about declining foot traffic.\n\nOverall thoughts\n\nWith record unemployment, first thing that happens is that you cut down on frivolous spending and that includes something like spending eight bucks on a Starbucks frappuccino.\n\nduring the recession of 2008 through a number of articles that showed how people stopped going to Starbucks and how people quickly started buying Folgers for their morning Joe.\n\nOne of the things that I am afraid that's Starbucks doesn't do well is offering a compelling breakfast menu.\n\nmajority of the stores are based on the concept of third place where individuals spend most of their time and that is almost like their second home or at least that's what the corporation wants to portray a place where people can come in lounge purchase stuff well that doesn't necessarily happen even if stores open up.\n\nThe difficulty of obtainning labour as ridiculous as it sounds I do have one believe that labour will get a little harder to okay jobs will be for front-facing I'm older mine said that perhaps if there is not necessarily a recovery that people less be likely to want to work as a barista I mean theoretically maybe they're one of the few options, but Starbucks may have to pay a bit more for hazard pay.\n\n\nSbux \n24/04 55 put", "created_utc": 1586790169.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0km3o/starbucks_is_a_short_dd/", "is_self": true}
