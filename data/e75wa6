{"id": "e75wa6", "title": "Long $MCD for 2020", "selftext": "I've been looking at buying $MCD as its currently trading significantly below its ATH of $220 at $195, and its a good company with strong fundamentals. The most recent dip is because of a firing of a CEO (he was banging his assistant or smtn like that, not a pedo or anything), and missing earnings. I'll try to ease fears about both of these things but first: why you should be optimistic. \n\nMcDonald's is moving towards having less company owned stores and more franchises, which is the reason earnings was poor. However this is good for their ROIC (return on invest capital, i.e how what percentage of a dollar invested will return a profit), which has increased from 12% to 17% meaning if they follow this trend they can either maintain costs and increase revenue, decreased costs and maintain revenue, or what is harder but still plausible, increase costs and massively increase profits. \n\nThey've invest a lot in AI to improve the user experience and adapt the menu as the customer moves through, all with the aim of getting them to spend more, which should result in greater profitability throughout 2020 as well.\n\nThe new CEO of McDonalds is very familiar with the company, and was in charge of their store redesign in the US which was a success. He's an industry veteran, and McDonalds already has a very clear and profitable path ahead. I expect nothing radical from the new leadership, it is still the same board and people around the C level.", "created_utc": 1575672516, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e75wa6/long_mcd_for_2020/", "is_self": true}
