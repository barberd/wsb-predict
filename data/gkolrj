I know what you're thinking, the report is only through May 15th. Now take into account that many of these ships will lock in these high rates through Q2 and even through Q3. Even if rates were to fall precipitously, to lets say what you see in 2018 on the chart on the left, the annualized rate might look something like what you see in 2015.\n\nNow finally, the chart on the right. Yes, rates have fallen, but you can actually visualize just how high they have been. Now we can speculate all we want, whether we will be in contango or not, the storage floating at sea will take time to burn off. We have made global supply cuts, but the demand has absolutely cratered. The storage rates will take time to normalize, on an annualized basis this is going to be an incredible year and these charts can help you visualize that.\n\nI'm not even going to go into potential catalysts like share buybacks, Q2/Q3 earnings, special dividends, potential storage issues when the june oil contract rolls off and someone gets caught holding the bag, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Buy shares and stop getting fucked by market makers who are going to exploit these smaller cap companies\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pm1xqpog22z41.png?width=1598&format=png&auto=webp&s=ccbf484e7dc2f903432c5dd2266620b0dabe047c", "created_utc": 1589603571.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gkolrj/tanker_gang_fresh_dd/", "is_self": true}
