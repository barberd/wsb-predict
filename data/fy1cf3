Right now $SPY is going up in share price, but going down in actual objective value.  The dollar index is rising, because all other currencies are eating shit.  The dollar as an objective asset is losing value, along with the entire world's currencies and markets, but it looks like it's increasing in value because it isn't tanking as hard as others.  We just printed this cash (not value) from ink and paper, magically adding fake value into the mix that looks like real value.\n\nWe have REDUCED the value of the market, while simultaneously INCREASED the share price of the funds that people use to gauge the health/strength/value of the market.  We bought shares with zero value cash, pumping the price upward and making it appear as if the market gained value.  IT DIDN'T.  IT GAINED PRICE, NOT VALUE.\n\nFor disclosure, I am holding GLD and SLV calls in my portfolio.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ewaluate ur portfolio divyesh](https://preview.redd.it/bgj5ptakavr41.jpg?width=308&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=34630fe1cb60501778749e24f2863ad86cbdc3ae)\n\nRight now, our lord and savior Jpow has been fucking CRANKING the gears in his machines.  He is going to print $4.4T when he's done, all from a measly $454B.  Don't forget that.  He's also got $2.3T in loans ready to go.  On top of all that, there's still over a trillion going back into the economy and people's pockets and nobody has a fucking clue how to save money anymore.\n\nThe security-backed market was $70.8T at the end of 2019.  We dropped to about 30% below all-time-high on deep cuts from uncertainty and flooding into cash.  $6.7T is in Jpow's fucking moneyclip raining down upon our markets, and who knows how much interest we've raked off setting the repo market into overdrive to boost liquidity.  Inflation doesn't happen immediately, it catches up later after the hole has been plugged and things seem to go back to normal.\n\nTL;DR\n\nSPY price goes up while market value goes down, inflation catches up later and damage to the dollar is covered up by the fact all other currencies are failing harder.\n\nTL;DR:TL;DR\n\nSPY 290c 4/17 bet the fucking house on it.", "created_utc": 1586468658.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fy1cf3/heres_why_spy_is_going_up/", "is_self": true}
