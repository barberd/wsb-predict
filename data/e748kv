SurveyMonkey provides survey software for free to 17 millions users and a more sophisticated set of paid tools through its self serve business and enterprise sales team. This is a SaaS business so most of the revenues are generated from monthly/yearly subscriptions. Key competitors are Qualtrics and Medallia and some other bottom fishers in the self serve markets. SVMK is disrupting the incumbents in the market with its far cheaper high quality product. \n\nToday the self serve business is 77% of revenues and is growing double digits. This is a massively profitable business as each sub comes from converting a free user with very minimal marketing or extra costs. Also, last year the company began rolling out \"account verification\" for those sharing paid accounts. At first they started given light nudges for account sharers to sign up for another subscription, but now they are being more aggressive and there is a long tailwind of growth just from converting these users to paid subs. \n\nThe enterprise business (23% of sales as of Q3 2019): Here is the real opportunity and where we are going to make big tendies. The company has recently built out a very strong enterprise sales team led by the ex head of sales at Adobe (which btw was introduced by Salesforce but more on that later). The enterprise business is growing 130%, and is in the first stages of its hyper growth. The company is aiming at selling to a core 15-30k customers that are already heavy SVMK users and when they switch to enterprise there is a 4x uplift in revenue on average. Sell side analysts are not separately modelling this business, and therefore don't understand how its leading to accelerating growth as enterprise becomes are larger piece of the pie. \n\nRight now the stock is trading at 6x 2020 sales of ~$760m, at a discount to it's SaaS peers growing at 20%+. I think going into Q4 and next year the stock re rates as the market starts to realise growth is accelerating to the mid 20%s in 2020 and beyond. Stock trades at $17 today, I think it can go to $30 by next year, and can be a 200-300% upside in a few years. \n\nLastly, I think it is very likely that SVMK does not stay as a standalone business and gets acquired, most likely by Salesforce. At IPO, Salesforce took a $40m stake. Recently, SVMK bought a company called GetFeedback which Salesforce also partly owned. Instead of cashing out they rolled over their stake into more SVMK shares. Finally, CEO of Salesforce has mentioned that they will only acquire companies that are accretive to the companies' sales growth. When SVMK IPOd it was only growing mid double digit, but now the company is growing close to 20% so Salesforce can buy it.\n\nOn risks: If the enterprise business is a flop and growth goes back down to 13-17% then I think this thing de rates back down to maybe 3-4x sales, so potential 40% downside there. \n\nI look forward to hearing all your autistic plays.", "created_utc": 1575664937, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e748kv/svmk_juicy_dd_close_to_100_upside/", "is_self": true}
