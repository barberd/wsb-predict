Say next week deaths are cut in half.  You probably will be bearish and say DEFAULTS COMING!! TIP OF RECESSION!\n\nThen defaults don't and businesses reopen.  PEOPLE STILL UNEMPLOYED, Q3 WILL BE DISASTER\n\nThen unemployments are cut drastically.  Q3 better than expected. SECOND WAVE OF VIRUS!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd finally vaccine arrives and second wave doesn't show up.  All businesses are flowing by that time.  <---- is that the time you will switch from Bear to Bull? (hint: this is also when you are completely broke and missed the biggest BTFD of the decade)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhats the point you change your minds out there Mega Bears?", "created_utc": 1586392242.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxicfj/question_for_serious_bears_when_will_you_accept/", "is_self": true}
