We can't go straight down and bear markets need that type of bounce in order to sustain going further down.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ahgtrtsphoo41.png?width=1256&format=png&auto=webp&s=4da2b65d383a4e9809a97749928539f6c0e6bc22\n\nNow considering the volatility of this market, there is a good chance we break through that level and test the 200 weekly MA or EMA around 23,800 range which is also slightly above the 21 day EMA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pvm1bu5hioo41.png?width=1254&format=png&auto=webp&s=be990dd7b50c846f3018b8be62e4f56235e70619\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Bear markets can't go straight down forever.
