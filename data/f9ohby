It was the last one on stock and they are not able to order new ones atm. I asked him if the supply was suffering due to Corona, which he confirmed.\n\nYesterday we ordered some household and food supplies from one of the largest local retailer. Many articles are sold out, due to a difficult supply situation. You can't find protective masks or hand sanitizer anymore. Obviously, supplies are running out everywhere and we are far from the bottom yet. This is in  Switzerland where we have one single confirmed case since yesterday.\n\nMy 5 cents: Economy will take a huge hit. Stock markets will stay red for a while.", "created_utc": 1582695436, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9ohby/corona_is_going_to_hit_our_globalized_economy_hard/", "is_self": true}
