{"id": "e8neku", "title": "Free money method", "selftext": "Ok so I found this method in the stock market that will work on any brokerage. I was trading SPY puts and LULU stock ( every time someone in my family buys Lululemon I buy the stock before they do so it goes up and then I make a profit - not the method though. this method I used requires rich white girls ) and then I had a catharsis. Stock goes up and down right? \n\nSo here's what you gotta do...\n\nWithdraw 100k or whatever you have left if you don't have that much. Buy 100k worth of any stock you choose. It has to go up and down a lot. Go all in and when it rises a bit sell and then repeat. now you may be thinking... there is a lot of risk. what if it drops? \n\nwell you see there are only like 1-3 peaks in a day and the stock changes like 100 times a day. so all you need to do it is not buy at the peaks and then it will go up eventually that is like a 1/100 chance of losing money. you just need to buy and sell it. 99/100 chance of gaining money \n\nhttps://prnt.sc/q8nnwg\nhere is a photo of a typical stock chart and my strategy incase you all don't understand\n\nif you are unlucky and think that you are always going to buy at the peak then just short it there is a 1/100 chance of you making profit but then it works for mad gains. I recommend shorting something you think will go up because then it will actually go down. literally no money at risk. it will just rebound even if you hit that 1/100", "created_utc": 1575962256, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e8neku/free_money_method/", "is_self": true}
