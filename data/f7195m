{"id": "f7195m", "title": "Noob question; please no hate", "selftext": "Have been trading regularly with $40k+ for the past few months on Robinhood, safe stocks mainly. Made about 15% on cvs. But lost over 5k today on SPCE (bought at 40$/piece). Fml\n\nNow I am trying to get into options, the more I read, the more it doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nWhy is there different option prices with different break even prices?\n\nExample: is buying SPCE call at 19$ with break even price of 37.05 better than buying SPCE CALL 20$ with break even if $37.30? Why are both of these numbers in Robinhood? \n\nIs there anyone that knows these stuff well and is selling to do an audio call to give better explanations \n\nThanks", "created_utc": 1582238661, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7195m/noob_question_please_no_hate/", "is_self": true}
