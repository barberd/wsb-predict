{"id": "hgd3i2", "title": "Why Facebook Calls will win", "selftext": "Facebook, an absolutely massive company, is down an astounding 7% right now on the news of some European snowflakes pulling ads from the platform for what they view to be \"hate speech\" when in reality, FB has been by far, the social media platform that has been the most for freedom of speech. In contrast to Twitter, YouTube, and other platforms, where (whether you agree or not) have been clearly outspoken against any speech they dont like. (Especially conservatives, which represent half the country). \n\nFB has been one of the most consistent and reliable stocks in the street for the past few years and nothing will change. They run a good company (boo hoo if you think they take your private info.) And they are going nowhere anytime soon. I run a company that spends over $2k on social media ads a year and I can tell you WITHOUT QUESTION, FB is the best ad platform. Their ads are super cheap and get great results and it is so much better than google or Twitter ads. In addition, I personally believe those platforms are destined to get in a war with trump soon. \n\nOverall, here is the DD. FB is a great company. Dont believe me? Look at the graph for the last 5 years you moron. They will come back up hard once people realize this is a stupid reason to go down. Especially since they will be effected minimally if at all from another COVID wave. Long FB\n\nMy positions: FB $230c 7/17 and $240c 8/21", "created_utc": 1593196192.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hgd3i2/why_facebook_calls_will_win/", "is_self": true}
