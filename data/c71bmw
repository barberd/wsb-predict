(explained)", "selftext": "Gather round lads, I\u2019m about to explain why the market liked the G20 meeting, risk and opportunities analysis, unknowns, and what the proverbial \u201cPriCeD iN\u201d really means. \n\nNow some of you desk junkies just finished you\u2019re business degree at state and graduated from flipping bitches to flipping options but soon you\u2019ll be working on projects. Projects report status. Try as you might, you can\u2019t get away from this. Status is often reported to executive leadership so don\u2019t let leadership think you\u2019re retarded because if you can\u2019t grasp these concepts. If it\u2019s any consolation though, they may think you\u2019re retarded anyways.\n\nMarkets, just like projects, are evaluated using many measurements which all can pretty much be boiled down to return on investment. The consensus price is determined by a fair valuation baseline, less risks, plus opportunities, with unknowns acting as volatility dial or a kind of standard deviation of sorts. \n\nNow I\u2019ll get into this weekend. \n\nThe market settled into the 290-295 range leading up to G20. This range had 3 main G20 components priced in.\n\nG20 R/Os\n\n1) Risk - unproductive talks, further tariffs, deteriorating relationship\n\n2) Opportunity - trade deal agreement\n\n3) Unknowns - could be anything.. Xi and Trump realize their queer tendencies and giggle like schoolgirls deflating confidence in leadership or Trump scuffs Xis shoes leading to WW3, you get the idea. \n\nNow here\u2019s the IMPORTANT part. This weekend, we mitigated a risk and worked past an unknown. We did not however lose an opportunity. While mitigating a risk and realizing an opportunity both move markets in the same direction they are actually very different events and should be viewed as such. \n\nRisks create downward pressure, opportunity creates upward pressure. The amount of pressure created is measured by the likelihood of the risk or opportunity being realized. This weekend was not about realizing that opportunity. It was about removing the risk. That opportunity, a trade deal, hasn\u2019t gone anywhere. Just because it wasn\u2019t realized this weekend doesn\u2019t mean you should price it out. What you apparently should price out through is further trade war escalation. \n\nNow get off your asses and go get your project management cert. Its way cheaper and way easier than an MBA.", "created_utc": 1561826142, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c71bmw/why_are_we_rallying_again_monday_explained/", "is_self": true}
