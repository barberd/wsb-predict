As other posters have shown, the US, UK, Spain, Germany, and France are all primed to explode in cases in the next 10 days.  We're going to see more and more travel restrictions, city/countrywide lockdowns, mandatory working from home, class cancellations, and other various **social distancing** measures. **Millions quarantined in their houses with nothing to do.**\n\nThe one group best set to handle the boredom of **social distancing**? **Gamers**\n\n**Gamestop is perfectly suited to supply normies video games during a crisis:**\n\n* Online store not busy selling $300 hand sanitizer like amazon\n* Widespread brick-and-mortar stores means much of the company's stock already distributed and within reach of consumers, even with local travel restrictions and shipping disruptions.\n* Small-store design can be manned by 1 or 2 employees, reducing operational requirements and risk of employee illness\n\n**Becky:** Schools are going to close.  **Kids only catch mild symptoms with COVID19, but they can spread it to others, so school closures are going to become more and more necessary to protect teachers, school staff, parents, and grandparents.**\n\nParents are going to have difficulty dealing with kids stuck inside all day instead of attending their state-mandated free childcare.  **How's Becky going to survive quarantined in a house with three bored middle-schoolers all with names that rhyme with Devin?**\n\n**By buying them an XboX**\n\n**Reggie:** For those of you that don't speak retard and need more reasons why this stock is going through the roof, I give you Reggie.  [Reggie Mother-fucking Fils-Aim\u00e9](https://nintendoeverything.com/wp-content/uploads/reggie-fils-aime-1-1-656x308.jpg) **just joined the board two days ago, and he's looking to kick some ass.  The former BAMF of Nintendo America would not have come out of retirement for a shit company.**  [Reggie has his dick out, and he's looking to turn this company around.](https://twitter.com/Reggie/status/1237118761460625409)\n\nThe markets have given up any hope on Gamestop.  Its stock is down bigly over the last year.  **But while the markets have shat 20% over the last month,** **~~GME is up 26% in the past two weeks.~~** **(Since writing this last night on an ambien binge, they had a drop due to a scheduled shareholder letter, but are coming back. Still up 20% since the start of the outbreak and climbing.)** They've hit bottom, Reggie is going to put them on his back, and they're going to beat earnings predictions at the end of March.  **In a month's time, analysts are going to be calling this company \"the Tesla of brick-and-mortar video-game retailers.\"**\n\n**Reggie I've got some slogans for you:**\n\n* **\"Gamers don't get sick, they get dubs\"**\n* **Coronavirus survival kit: (contains 1 xbox, 3 games, and 25 rolls of toilet paper)**\n* **IDK maybe GFuel has antiviral properties?** **^((it really doesn't don't actually tell people that)****\\*\\*\\*\\*)**\n* **\"E-A SPORTS : We're not cancelled\"**\n\n**TLDR:GME 4.50-8C 3/20-4/17**\n\nMy positions:  [https://i.imgur.com/qoV8v8h.png](https://i.imgur.com/qoV8v8h.png) I would have more, but my gay ToS account won't let my direct deposit be used for options yet, but going to load up on more 4/9 and 4/17 calls when that shit clears.\n\n**If this shit doesn't hit $8 in the next 3 weeks, I will eat a whole fucking jar of mayonnaise.**\n\n^(\\*I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice.)", "created_utc": 1584024078.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhhcqb/coronavirus_becky_reggie_and_the_return_of/", "is_self": true}
