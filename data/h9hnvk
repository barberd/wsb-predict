{"id": "h9hnvk", "title": "LONG SNAP", "selftext": "# Oh Snap!\n\n\ud83c\udfa7\u00a0*If you prefer listening to reading, you can listen here:* [*Oh Snap! (Audio Edition)*](https://notboring.substack.com/p/oh-snap-audio-edition)\n\nIn 2012, I invested in Facebook at around $19 per share. In 2013, I sold it for $45. I thought I was a genius. Since then, though, Facebook is up another 5x - I missed out on most of the gains. Back then, people were unconvinced that Facebook could do mobile well. Once they did mobile well, people doubted that they could increase the ad load in the mobile News Feed in order to sustain growth. Wrong again. Facebook has built one of the two best advertising businesses in human history.\n\nWhat I learned: when you think you\u2019ve found the next big platform, don\u2019t worry about the little things. Invest in it, don\u2019t trade it.\u00a0\n\nOver the next five years, Snap has the potential to be as big as today\u2019s biggest tech companies. Becoming the next platform is a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and I think Snap is best positioned to be that platform.\n\nThe stakes are high. The chart below shows the market caps of today\u2019s biggest consumer(ish) tech companies, which provides a rough estimate of the upside in Snap if it\u2019s able to take advantage of the opportunity ahead of it.\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xz6pncz553551.png?width=3388&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e4d794f9ec92850bc4be48ced683093b3063199\n\nSnap has had a rough go of it as a public company, and most of us kind of forgot about it. I\u2019m putting everyone back on alert.\u00a0\n\nI haven\u2019t been as excited about a company as I am about Snap in a long time. It checks some major nerd boxes for me:\u00a0\n\n\u2705 **Hype Cycles**: We are catching Snap at the right time, as it\u2019s heading up the Slope of Enlightenment. Others will slowly begin to wake up to Snap\u2019s potential, you heard it here first.\n\n\u2705 **Worldbuilding:** Spiegel and Snap are patiently laddering towards a long-term vision so big that most people missed it.\n\n\u2705 **Mirrorworld:** Snap is building the next major platform - Augmented Reality. Aside from being a lot of fun, AR presents an internet-scale financial opportunity.\n\nWhile most of us were distracted, Evan Spiegel built a new world. Today, Snap is weaving together a complex and defensible suite of products, technology, content, and SDKs that position it to build the next big platform - the one that blends the physical and digital worlds.\u00a0\n\nIf you, like me, missed it, don\u2019t worry. We\u2019re not alone. Scott Galloway declared \u201c[The End of Snap](https://medium.com/s/no-mercy-no-malice/no-mercy-no-malice-the-end-of-snap-tesla-af4499558ce0)\u201d in October 2018. Ben Thompson hasn\u2019t written seriously about the company since [last July](https://stratechery.com/?s=snap), after writing about it almost monthly between 2015 and 2019. There\u2019s a good reason, too.\u00a0\n\n### The Hype Cycle\n\nI want to take you back to a time when the only app on our Nokia phone was Snake, when Britney Spears\u2019 *...Baby One More Time* was #1 on the charts, and one of my all-time favorite movies was released. That movie, *She\u2019s All That,* has a lot in common with Snapchat.\n\nIn case you haven\u2019t watched *She\u2019s All That* recently, I\u2019ll give you a quick rundown.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nZack (Freddie Prinze Jr.) starts the movie as the most popular guy in school, but falls from grace when his girlfriend breaks up with him. In an effort to gain back popularity, he accepts a bet with his best friend Dean: that he can turn Laney Boggs, a dorky art student, into the Prom Queen. Against all odds, and after a persistent effort, Zack and Laney start to like each other, and it looks like Zack might win the bet *and* the girl. But then Dean (*traitor!*) reveals that Zack only asked her to win a bet.\u00a0\n\nZack and Laney break up. They\u2019re both at a new low. Zack takes his sister to prom, and Laney\u2019s planning on skipping altogether until Dean shows up and takes her. Laney loses the Prom Queen crown to Zack\u2019s ex, Taylor, and goes home, where\u2026 ZACK IS WAITING FOR HER!!\u00a0\n\nThey fall in love again by the pool. They kiss. It\u2019s one of the most romantic scenes in cinematic history.\u00a0([You can watch it here](https://youtu.be/GdrDuVImE2c))\n\nAt graduation, we are left with the impression that the best days are ahead for Zack and Laney. And we cry happy tears, and those tears come back any time we hear [Sixpence None the Richer\u2019s \u201cKiss Me\u201d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8N-qO3sPMjc). (Wait, just me? Embarrassing.)\n\nZack and Laney\u2019s journeys look something like this:\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/joi5rv5b53551.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd4287bfb77ae0f23994c3ab5c1216cc68f3768f\n\nCool, so we\u2019ve established that I love *She\u2019s All That*. What does any of this have to do with Snap?\u00a0\n\nWell, hidden beneath those screen grabs is a chart that will be familiar to you if you\u2019ve been reading Not Boring for a while: the Gartner Hype Cycle. According to Gartner itself:\u00a0\n\n>*Gartner Hype Cycles provide a graphic representation of the maturity and adoption of technologies and applications, and how they are potentially relevant to solving real business problems and exploiting new opportunities.*\u00a0\n\nMore simply, Gartner Hype Cycles describe the fact that many technologies, industries, and products come out of the gate hot with an initial use case, get really popular for a little while, then fade as that initial use case fails to live up to the hype. At that point, some products just die - countless flash-in-the-pan apps fall into this category - while others find real practical applications and rise from the ashes to provide ongoing value.\u00a0\n\n**Rocketship to the Peak**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0j6goe7c53551.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d3936e7944084e97e5eefe1085c2c02afbacc7e\n\nSnap certainly fit the left side of the chart. Triggered by cameras on every phone and ephemeral messaging (hence the Ghost logo), Snap shot up to the Peak of Inflated Expectations quickly. Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown ([we don\u2019t talk about him](https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/02/snapchat-reggie-brown/)) launched Snapchat as \u201cPictaboo\u201d in July 2011. By October 2012, Snapchat users were sharing 20 million images per day. By November 2013, two-year-old Snapchat had users sharing 350 million photos per day, and Spiegel reportedly turned down a $3 billion acquisition offer from Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook.\u00a0\n\nSnapchat was a rocketship, even if, or because, it was viewed as just a [sexting app](https://techcrunch.com/2012/05/12/snapchat-not-sexting/). This whole [timeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Snapchat) is worth checking out, but suffice it to say, Snapchat grew spectacularly from its 2011 founding through its March 2, 2017 IPO. Its stock closed at $27.09 the next day, good for a $39 billion market cap. Turns out, though, that three years later, $27.09 is still SNAP\u2019s all-time high.\u00a0\n\n**Elevator Down to the Trough**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/69bwws5d53551.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=f84103b592ced1ba560bcf8c1218d81a3e62976d\n\nI remember the SNAP IPO distinctly, because I remember all of our parents asking whether they should buy SNAP. We thought it was way overvalued for a photo messaging app, and it turns out, the market agreed. SNAP\u2019s stock price tumbled 81% from its March 2017 high of $27.09 to an all time low of $4.99 on December 21, 2018. In September 2018, [Recode cited four reasons](https://www.vox.com/2018/9/16/17861692/snap-stock-decline-explained-user-growth-evan-spiegel) for the fall:\u00a0\n\n1. **Slowing Business Growth:** Snap was slow to bring advertisers onto the platform, causing analysts to cut their revenue estimates by 50%.\u00a0\n2. **Increased Competition:** Instagram Stories copied Snapchat, and used Facebook\u2019s distribution to eclipse Snapchat\u2019s Daily Active Users (DAUs).\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uu9jzs2e53551.png?width=764&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc6879855aa2d1f49ee264c8cc5eab80f8d94edb\n\n3. **Losing Users.** Snap redesigned its app in early 2018, pissing off important users. Kylie Jenner\u2019s tweet about the redesign caused SNAP\u2019s market cap to drop $1.3 billion in a day, and Snapchat lost 3 million DAUs in Q2 2018.\n\n[https://twitter.com/KylieJenner/status/966429897118728192?s=20](https://twitter.com/KylieJenner/status/966429897118728192?s=20)\n\n4. **Executive Departures.** Between the IPO and the Recode article, Snap lost its CFO, CSO, VP of Product, VP of Sales, VP of Engineering, and General Counsel. Those executives\u2019 compensation was heavily based on the sagging stock price.\n\nThis is right around the time that Galloway called \u201c[The End of Snap](https://medium.com/s/no-mercy-no-malice/no-mercy-no-malice-the-end-of-snap-tesla-af4499558ce0)\u201d and that Thompson stopped writing quite so frequently about the company (I count 10 articles in 2017, 6 in 2018, 4 in 2019, and 0 in 2020). I\u2019m guilty here too. I\u2019ve written about all of Snap\u2019s contemporaries, but I haven\u2019t talked about Snap. I didn\u2019t hear a lot about Snap and I wasn\u2019t receiving snaps, so I kind of forgot about it. Even when I asked people who have opinions on every company for their opinions on Snap for this piece, I got a lot of, \u201cI don\u2019t knows\u201d and \u201cI haven\u2019t thought much about Snap.\u201d\u00a0\n\nWhat I missed, though, is that I didn\u2019t hear about Snap as much as competitors like TikTok *by design*. TikTok is the greatest virality engine ever built; Snap doesn\u2019t want to go viral. I just tried to Snap something and share it broadly, and I couldn\u2019t figure out how to do it. So while us olds sleep on Snap from the outside, millions of younger best friends spend their entire lives communicating in there. We all underestimated Evan.\u00a0\n\n**Underestimating Evan**\n\nHitting the Trough of Disillusionment is the make or break moment for a company. From down there, the journey up the Slope of Enlightenment is far from guaranteed. Most once-buzzy social companies don\u2019t make it out the other side. RIP Yo, Yik Yak, and Whisper.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u4dhiphi53551.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=88329d208be21637e7f2dfa59977306805fba581\n\nGalloway, and many others, predicted that Snap would go the way of Yo, Path, and Myspace. If it was lucky, maybe Disney or Amazon would buy it.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: I think what defines whether a company makes it through the Trough of Disillusionment or not is whether there\u2019s a Worldbuilder or a Shotcaller at the helm.\u00a0\n\nThe companies that fail after the initial hype were Shotcallers: they only had one product in mind and they ran at it hard, backed by big venture dollars. The Yo guys really thought that sending \u201cYo\u201d to each other was the future, communication in its simplest form. When that didn\u2019t work, there was no backup plan.\u00a0\n\nEvan Spiegel didn\u2019t even cross my mind when I was writing [*Two Ways to Predict the Future*](https://notboring.substack.com/p/two-ways-to-predict-the-future), but he really should have. **Evan Spiegel is a Worldbuilder.**\u00a0\n\nIn *Two Ways to Predict the Future*, I wrote that Worldbuilders have three things in common:\u00a0\n\n1. They predict something non-obvious about the way the world is moving before others see it and before the market is ready for their ultimate vision.  \n\n\n* For Spiegel, this was that the camera was going to be the way we all communicate and interact with the world.\n\n1. They create a wedge into the market and leverage it into a much larger opportunity. The public often ridicules or dismisses the initial wedge product.\u00a0  \n\n\n* This one\u2019s too easy. Everyone dismissed Snapchat as a sexting app.\n\n1. They timestamp their vision, whether in public announcements or confidential documents.\u00a0  \n\n\n* This [2018 company-wide memo](https://cheddar.com/media/snap-ceo-evan-spiegel-company-memo-on-2019-strategic-goals-and-profitability) from Spiegel clearly lays out (parts of) the plan, and this tweet from former Snapchat employee Lucy Guo shows that Spiegel has been working on recently-announced Snap Minis for at least four years.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7[**Lucy Guo** @lucy\\_guo@dtrinh Seeing Evan execute his plans 4 years later is heartwarming. I remember when I first heard him brainstorming this and thought \u201cWow, this guy really is a product visionary\u201d](https://twitter.com/lucy_guo/status/1271593254098579457?s=20)\n\n[June 13th 2020](https://twitter.com/lucy_guo/status/1271593254098579457?s=20)\n\n[**28** Likes](https://twitter.com/lucy_guo/status/1271593254098579457?s=20)\n\nWorldbuilders are rare. Bezos, Musk, Carta\u2019s Henry Ward. When you find one, you bet on them. I\u2019m a little late to the party, but not *too* late. Snap is right at the beginning of the climb up the Slope of Enlightenment.\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x0futf4k53551.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c83516790b71840e319babfa6eae08a86b34b61\n\nI\u2019m now convinced that when its journey is complete, it will be one of the biggest, most important companies in history.\u00a0\n\n### So What is Snap Building?\n\nIf you\u2019re a Worldbuilder, one of the advantages of being in the Trough of Disillusionment is that it gives you time out of the spotlight to build your world. Over the past year or so, as measured by [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2011-01-01%202020-06-12&geo=US&q=snapchat), Snap had less public interest than it has since early 2015.\u00a0\n\nOver the past two months, though, the new Snap emerged, with two big events driving renewed interest in the company:\u00a0\n\n1. Gangbuster Q1 [earnings](https://investor.snap.com/news-releases/2020/04-21-2020-210949737) and user growth that sent shares up 37% in one day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/seh9ed1l53551.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=571d6cc6e2397a7e195312fd318e83b6f9c5a30b\n\n2. Thursday\u2019s Partner Summit 2020, *in Augmented Reality (AR)*, renewed excitement and convinced me that Snap is the leading contender to make AR real.\n\n[https://youtu.be/BfvubHha69k](https://youtu.be/BfvubHha69k)\n\nLast week, in [*Business is the New Sports*](https://notboring.substack.com/p/business-is-the-new-sports), I wrote about the power of keynotes and product launches in rallying fans around a brand, using Steve Jobs and Elon Musk as the canonical examples. Evan Spiegel and Snap took the torch on Thursday.\n\n[Turner Novak](https://twitter.com/TurnerNovak), who has understood Snap better than anyone [for](https://turner.substack.com/p/a-deep-dive-on-snaps-content-business) [a](https://turner.substack.com/p/how-the-snapchat-redesign-could-affect) [long](https://twitter.com/TurnerNovak/status/1092852491178442754?s=20) [time](https://twitter.com/TurnerNovak/status/1048790251601313793?s=20), wrote a [thorough summary of the event](https://turner.substack.com/p/snap-partner-summit-2020-recap-and), which you should check out, in addition to just watching.\n\nWatching the Summit unfold, I felt like Charlie in *It\u2019s Always Sunny.*\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3a5ygq9n53551.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=b75399aecffa834383dbf99969e0f5043741c003\n\nBefore watching the Summit, I thought of Snap as a social media company, a competitor to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, and the rest. It\u2019s not though. Snap isn\u2019t just building a camera-first messaging app; it\u2019s building the platform of the future. It\u2019s building mirrorworld.\u00a0\n\n**Welcome to Mirrorworld**\n\nIn February 2019, Kevin Kelly wrote one of the most thought-provoking essays I\u2019ve read: [*AR Will Spark the Next Big Technology Platform -- Call it Mirrorworld*](https://www.wired.com/story/mirrorworld-ar-next-big-tech-platform/). In it, Kelly describes a digital world mapped 1:1 with the physical world, which we can interact with, experience, and manipulate just like the real world. Mirrorworld, according to Kelly, won\u2019t take place in Virtual Reality (VR), but rather in Augmented Reality (AR). It will blend digital and physical, layering bits\u2019 infinite possibilities on top of atoms\u2019 *realness*.\u00a0\n\nMirrorworld means being able to reproduce that [Travis Scott Fortnite concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYeFAlVC8qU) in a park instead of our basement, with real people, whenever we want, or looking at a restaurant from the street and being able to see the menu and pictures of the dishes. It means having a full suite of digital tools available to enhance our physical experience.\u00a0\n\nIt also means a big business opportunity. The first platform of the digital age was the web. The second was social media. The third, according to Kelly, will be mirrorworld.\u00a0\n\n>*We are now at the dawn of the third platform, which will digitize the rest of the world.* ***Whoever dominates this grand third platform will become among the wealthiest and most powerful people and companies in history****, just as those who now dominate the first two platforms have. Also, like its predecessors, this new platform will unleash the prosperity of thousands more companies in its ecosystem, and a million new ideas\u2014and problems\u2014that weren\u2019t possible before machines could read the world.*\u00a0\n\nKelly points to Microsoft (Hololens) and Magic Leap ([uh oh](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-11/augmented-reality-startup-magic-leap-is-said-to-explore-a-sale)) as the two leading contenders to build mirrorworld.\u00a0\n\nHe doesn\u2019t mention Snap once. But watch this video. What does it make you think of?\u00a0\n\n[https://youtu.be/4jA1RM5\\_WMc](https://youtu.be/4jA1RM5_WMc)\n\nWatching that clip gave me chills. Qi Pan, the Snap Computer Vision Engineer narrating the video, says about Local Lenses:\u00a0\n\n>*Now, Snapchatters can join a persistent, shared AR world built right on top of the physical one. You and your friends can step into these worlds together, collaborating creatively and experiencing a whole new dimension of AR.*\n\nThey\u2019re building fucking mirrorworld!\u00a0\n\n**Snap\u2019s Ladder to Mirrorworld**\n\nWhen I said that Evan Spiegel was a Worldbuilder, I meant it literally. And when you think of Snap as the company that\u2019s building mirrorworld, everything starts to \\*snap\\* into focus.\u00a0\n\nBack in March 2016, when Ben Thompson still wrote about Snapchat, he wrote [Snapchat\u2019s Ladder](https://stratechery.com/2016/snapchats-ladder/). In it, he compared Snapchat to Netflix, in that both were executing \u201cladder-up\u201d strategies: a series of moves that build off of each other with the end goal in mind from the beginning. It\u2019s like a Worldbuilder starting with an unassuming wedge and trading up en route to the ultimate goal.\u00a0\n\nFor Snap, to Thompson, that means starting with Snaps, then building Stories, then Discover, then Feeds and Optionality. The ladder he described built up to \u201cowning messaging in the United States.\u201d\u00a0\n\nWhat Thompson didn\u2019t grasp - nor could anyone outside the company - is that those three rungs were just the first three rungs on a ladder dozens of rungs high. At the top of the ladder, high above \u201cowning messaging in the United States,\u201d is mirrorworld, with Snap as the platform powering it all.\u00a0\n\nTo climb the ladder, Snap is employing the Amazon \u201cFirst and Best Customer\u201d strategy. It builds products for its own app first - like Lenses, its first AR hit - and then opens up the tools to both its community to create within Snapchat, and third-party developers to incorporate Snapchat\u2019s features into third-party apps.\n\nSnap is building a wide-ranging set of products that build off of each other and work together to lead to a future in which Snap powers the mirrorworld. It\u2019s big and complex, so let\u2019s start small. Bitmoji gives a glimpse into Snap\u2019s foresight.\u00a0\n\n**Bitmoji - Those Are Those Stickers That Kinda Look Like Me, Right?**\n\nSnap [acquired Bitstrips](https://www.wsj.com/articles/snapchat-buys-bitmoji-app-for-more-than-100-million-1458876017), the creators of Bitmoji, in March 2016. Thompson thought it was smart because Snap might be able to monetize Bitmoji by selling stickers to Snapchatters and selling companies the ability to create branded stickers. Snap\u2019s plans were much bigger. Now, Bitmoji is a key part of Snapchat\u2019s Chat, Snap Games, Snap Map, and Weather products.\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s how the \u201cfirst and best customer\u201d strategy works at Snap: first, they build for Snapchat, then they open up to 3rd party. Product, then platform. It\u2019s a flywheel.\u00a0\n\nFirst, Snapchat made it really easy to send Bitmoji through the app, pulling new users into the product and retaining existing ones. The first time I used Snapchat was to create my Bitmoji. Now, through [Bitmoji Kit](https://kit.snapchat.com/bitmoji-kit), Bitmoji is available in 3rd-party Android and iOS keyboards, *giving Snapchat reach into nearly every smart mobile device on the planet*.\u00a0\n\nSimilarly, Snap first used Bitmoji in Snap Games, and has now opened up Bitmoji to be used by 3rd party game developers, giving Snapchat a presence in games far beyond the ghost icon.\u00a0This map shows Bitmoji\u2019s reach within Snap and in 3rd party products.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dvn3pl4r53551.png?width=1415&format=png&auto=webp&s=311da4c52804c2e5e07486e5798ee2a5e928d235\n\nSnap even built its recently announced Minis - little apps built right into its Chat - on top of its game infrastructure. It\u2019s not difficult to imagine Minis one day being available in all of the keyboards where Bitmoji currently live.\u00a0\n\nBitmoji is Snap\u2019s friendly tentacle into a universe of 3rd party apps and a testing ground for mirrorworld. And that\u2019s *just Bitmoji.* Until like three minutes ago, most of you thought they were just silly cartoons.\n\n**The Camera Company**\n\nSnap\u2019s Camera is an even more powerful platform than Bitmoji, and the main one on top of which they\u2019ll build the mirrorworld. The evolution of Snapchat\u2019s Camera is deserving of an essay in itself, but if you strip away a lot of the complexity (and brilliance) it can be expressed as a ladder.\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hlqu5u2s53551.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=10b69bcfcc415853e8e1d991c05257b472465f3f\n\nFrom humble beginnings as a camera that may or may not have been used primarily to send dick pics, Snap has built one of the most broadly distributed pieces of AR technology in the world. In some ways, mirrorworld is already here: over 135 million people create AR with Snap every day. And with the announcement of Camera Kit, which allows 3rd party developers to integrate Snap\u2019s Camera into their apps - transitioning the Camera from a product to a platform - that number will rise.\u00a0\n\nCombined with the announcement of Local Lenses, soon millions of people in hundreds of apps will be able to digitally transform the physical neighborhoods in which they live and the way they appear in them.\n\nInstead of Shotcalling - building out the full suite of hardware and software and pushing it onto users - Snap is building the platform on which Snap, its users, and partners will build the mirrorworld together.\u00a0\n\n**And Snap Has the Right Users for a New Platform**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kopf88zs53551.png?width=791&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbbe0a47d96170a7f9824a95016a83367c080cdf\n\nSnap has a big, engaged base of users who are the right age to pioneer a new technology platform. It\u2019s in the sweet spot - it has been around long enough to have a large user base, which is necessary to create enough adoption for a new platform, while its users are young enough (and geographically dense enough) to adopt a new spatial platform.\u00a0\n\nTo that end, two stats from the Partner Summit blew my mind:\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dcpfj7st53551.png?width=1137&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5ed6eaea1755517f0d9a30d9e2d84a2ba0b0324\n\nBecause Snap is not designed for virality, it\u2019s really difficult for an outsider to realize just how big it is with this key demographic. On a [September 2019 ](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/talks-at-gs/evan-spiegel.html)[*Talks at GS*](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/talks-at-gs/evan-spiegel.html)[ podcast](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/talks-at-gs/evan-spiegel.html), Spiegel highlighted his user growth strategy: don\u2019t worry too much about attracting older users, just **keep its users engaged while they get older and continue to attract new young users**. Despite the pressure on him to grow DAUs - which he could do by making the product friendlier to older and/or international users - Spiegel realized something magical that Matthew McConaughey\u2019s character in *Dazed and Confused* summarized so succinctly (and creepily):\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tvu5bfmu53551.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e492dc9f946c1ff0819efa6c068dbc412ecd519\n\nBoomers and even older Millennials won\u2019t be the early adopters of a transformative new platform. Just as my Pop Pop wasn\u2019t among the first people to adopt the internet, and my mom wasn\u2019t one of the first people on social media, I won\u2019t be one of the first people in mirrorworld. Snapchat owns the people who will be: young Americans.\u00a0\n\nBecause its users are Gen Z and younger Millennials who appreciate Snap\u2019s values, it can say and do the right things now and build long-term trust with them. Spiegel kicked off the Partner Summit with words of support for the protestors, and his team introduced four new docuseries featuring a black cowboy, the world\u2019s most popular fighter, a transgender hair stylist, and two gay black friends. Facebook can\u2019t do that.\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gxa1q5kv53551.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5995a9ee4103566831d35e1d58c8cbfa98a2e14\n\nSnap is on the right side of history, particularly in the eyes of its young demographic. Mirrorworld will be more intertwined with our lives than any previous platform; that level of trust is crucial.\u00a0\n\n### Snappy Conclusion\n\nBecause there are so many pieces to the Snap puzzle, I feel like I\u2019m still just scratching the surface. In addition to the suites around Bitmoji and Camera, Snap also boasts **Minis, Snap Map, Local Business Listings, Voice Control**, **Snap Originals, Happening Now, Ad Kit, Story Kit, Creative Kit, and Login Kit,** and I\u2019m sure I\u2019m missing some.\n\nSnap might be the first American company to become a WeChat-style super app. Its mobile-first streaming business puts Quibi to shame and is approaching Netflix\u2019s US viewership. 125 million people interacted with its news service last year. Through Snap Kit, it powers 20 of the top 100 apps in the iOS and Google Play Store. The Snap Map is a crucial lens into the heart of the protests, offering unfiltered and unbiased views on the ground.\u00a0\n\nAnd we didn\u2019t even talk about any of those products in this piece.\n\nEven if we can\u2019t see it yet, these are not just standalone products. Snap has shown that its products connect in ways that are not obvious to outsiders. Who would have thought that personalized cartoons would serve as a Trojan Horse into games and mobile operating systems?\u00a0\n\nI started untangling and retangling all of the ways that Snap\u2019s products could work together to power the AR platform of the future, and if I can get that map to a legible place, I\u2019ll share it. Without seeing the full picture yet, though, I can already see something beautiful and powerful emerging.\n\nBy spinning a web of connected products, each building and feeding off of the others, Snap has built moats that will make it impervious to feature theft. When it all comes together, Snap will be one of the most important companies in the world.\n\nBusiness is the new sports, and I\u2019m jumping on the Snap bandwagon.\n\nIf you want to read the original, check it out here: [https://notboring.substack.com/p/oh-snap-](https://notboring.substack.com/p/oh-snap-)", "created_utc": 1592232095.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h9hnvk/long_snap/", "is_self": true}
