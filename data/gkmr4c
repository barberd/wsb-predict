Last week was a strange one, markets went way down then tried to make a pathetic comeback and the week before it was all green and golden. Now if you've done your history you'll know that most recessions have a false bottom then crash all over again. It's just how it is. I'm not sure if you've seen the data but except for those midwest morons celebrating at random bars, most Americans aren't spending money except on grocery, alcohol and weed. Look up the numbers if you don't believe me. Real estimates put unemployment at 25%, and a bet a shit ton of people's savings are in the shitter or close to it. I don't care about your politics, but if again you look at history the Spanish Flu of 1918 also had a false bottom because \\* spoiler alert \\* they re-opened too quickly because of random morons. Sound familiar?\n\nSo you do what you want but I am hedging myself. You can agree or disagree, IDGAF but here's exactly what I did this week;\n\nSQQQ call - 5/22 @ $11\n\nSQQQ call - 6/19 @ $20\n\nGDX call 7/17 @ $40\n\nThe last 2 I bought Monday and the first I bought today 5 min before close. I did the math, checked the IV and I figured this. 20% of my total investments are in these. If I'm wrong and stocks go up, I'll lose all the value in those, but my other options will destroy them and I'll be up. If I'm right, they will carry my portfolio to at least a break even but depending on SQQQ especially I could make money in the downtown.\n\nSo regardless if you're a bear or a bull, if you want to make money you have to play both sides of the coin in these dark times.", "created_utc": 1589595542.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gkmr4c/bull_or_bear_it_matters_not/", "is_self": true}
