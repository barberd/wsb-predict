{"id": "ck2bxw", "title": "INTC to the doghouse", "selftext": "The only possible good news left for Intel is Fed's meeting tomorrow. Everything else is not good:\n\n\\- It jumped on ER results in AH and was a flop in regular hours.     \n\n\\- It sold partnership with MU (to MU). It sold 5G modem division to APPL. Patents and engineers.  I don't remember if they still have SSD division, haven't seen Intel's SSDs in the store for quite some time now.\n\n\\- While AMD moved to 7nm INTC still can't get 10nm to work. \n\n\\- AMD ER: Good AMD sales are bad for INTC, bad AMD guidance is bad for INTC as well.   \n\nFrom TA view - it's overbought. Well,  all chips are overbought, they will all go down. INTC will lead.  \n\nSo if you want to buy calls wait until it hit 47.", "created_utc": 1564541321, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ck2bxw/intc_to_the_doghouse/", "is_self": true}
