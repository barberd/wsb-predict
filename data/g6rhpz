{"id": "g6rhpz", "title": "Gilead Play Update", "selftext": "Last week I made this post (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g35u04/gilead_play/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) explaining why I think remdesivir and therefore Gilead and the market overall have been over hyped and will tank. \n\nIf you think I am posting now out of a childish need to say \u201cI told you so\u201d, you\u2019re absolutely fucking right. \n\nBut I also want to explain how I think this recent leak changes things, from my perspective. This is still not financial advice.\n\nThe data on the WHO website, if this news source can be trusted (the screenshot looks legit, but what do I know about photoshop?) Included 237 patients.\n\n237 patients is basically a phase 2 trial. This trial included 158 on remdesivir and 79 on standard of care. The trial showed no benefit on time to improvement, and the % of patients dying was similar between groups. \n\nThe typical development process for a drug is phase 2, then phase 3 if positive results come out. If this trial had been done first, there is a 0% chance Gilead would have moved forward with phase 3 trials. It would be a waste of money because the trial would most likely fail, and investors would sprint for the exit.\n\nUnfortunately for GILD, they already started the trials. So now they have to say things like \u201cwe didn\u2019t give the ok to publish yet\u201d and \u201cwe still think there is potential\u201d. This is just PR to stave off a complete collapse of the stock.\n\nIn my original post and comments in it, I explained that I think the drug could work, but even so the stock is overhyped. Now, I think the drug will likely fail, and thus the stock is even more badly overhyped.\n\n**TLDR: GILD 60p 6/19**", "created_utc": 1587664892.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6rhpz/gilead_play_update/", "is_self": true}
