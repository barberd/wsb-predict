{"id": "fwqwba", "title": "How to get around the PDT rule", "selftext": "So like many of you, I've been fucked by the PDT by riding high intra day only to gap down the next day. How can you get around this while you have less than $25,000 and have been flagged? **You short the put option at a strike price just below your option price.** \n\nFor example, imagine you see the market going down and you by a 5/15 SPY 270p. You buy it but then realize, oh shit I'm flagged by the PDT rule and can't sell today. You worry tomorrow might be a big bull run day like today. What can you do?\n\nYou can go into your account and sell to open a put just below the strike price of your current put. Let's say 5/15 SPY 269p. But wait, don't sell to open options require a ton of cash or collateral? Yes, the collateral is the 270 put you bought earlier. Your max loss is now the amount between the price of the 270 put and the 269 put. Let's say it's a $.50 for simplicity. You subtract the $.5 from the $1 spread and that's your max profit. The Debit is your max loss. That means you can only lose a max of $50 on the trade per contract if it zooms up.\n\nSo, for direct example. \n\n**3 5/15 SPY 270 purchased at $14.00 for a total buy of $4,200.** \n\nLet's say the market dipped and the price of the put rose to it's current price of $20 and you have $6000. You then short sell 3 269 puts at $19.50 netting you $5,850 back into your account. That sum is now safe from overnight moves. The remaining $150 tied up in the debit spread could gain or lose. The max loss is the $150 for the debit. The max profit is the spread between the strike price minus the debit which is $0.5. You multiply that by 100 for the number of shares and then 3 for the number of options contracts and you get a max profit of $150 off the remaining money tied up in puts.\n\nIf things go bad, you just locked in $1,650 in pure profit regardless of overnight moves. Let's say the next day is a huge bear day and the price drops 8%. You just gained an additional $150 for a total profit of $1800 on $4200. However, you lost out on the much higher profit of keeping just the long put.\n\nThe next day, whether the gap is up or down, you've locked in your intraday profits and you can exit the position. You are capping your potential gains somewhat since you can't just close your position the same day. However, given the volatility of this market, it's a much smarter move than simply praying overnight for no gaps. For you bulls, this strategy works the same for calls. The strike price of the shorted option just needs to be 1 higher instead.\n\n**EDIT:** Yes, I know this is a debit spread. However, I wanted to explain it in a way that people could understand. I knew about debit spreads but didn't realize they could be used this way as a hedge to lock in intraday profits and avoid the PDT rule.", "created_utc": 1586287696.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fwqwba/how_to_get_around_the_pdt_rule/", "is_self": true}
