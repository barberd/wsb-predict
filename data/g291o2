Hear me out, CCL is already more than 70% down from its all-time high of this past year. It has pretty much absorbed most bad news and expectations for people to go on cruises are already low. The slightest good news pumps this stock up as you probably have seen from earlier this week. I am going to tell you why I think CCL has seen the worst of its pain:\n\n\\-People have short-term memory for markets. People will still go on cruises, they may not go immediately after lockdown but many people are still booking and taking advantage of rare deals offered by the cruise lines. Don't believe me? Check out r/cruise \\- lots of people are booking through major cruise lines like Carnival.\n\n\\-Despite the outbreak, bookings are up. \"CruiseCompete.com has seen a 40% increase in bookings for 2021 over the last 45 days, with only 11% of those from customers with trips canceled.\"  Only 11% were rebookings. \"In an analysis of the cruise industry, Swiss banking giant UBS wrote that cruise booking volume for 2021 was up 9% in the last 30 days compared with the same time last year\" and \"Booking volume was even higher for trips to Asia and Alaska.\" It appears that people are not scared of going internationally. Hell, speaking anecdotally, one of my own friends went on a cruise during heightened fears of the Coronavirus last month. Plus, in the current atmosphere, it actually is cheaper compared to international travel vacation via airlines in terms of value provided to go on a cruise for a vacation. (Lodging, food, sights for several days for only a few hundred dollars per person in a lot of cases).\n\n\\-Still don't believe me that people are not afraid of booking cruises? \"An online poll of more than 4,600 cruise passengers found that about 75% said they plan to either resume taking cruises at the same frequency as before or more often once the coronavirus crisis subsides, according to CruiseCritic.com, a cruise review site.\" But, OP, what about the other 25%??? \"The other 25% in the poll said they plan to cruise less often or stay away from cruising indefinitely.\" Hmm.\n\n\\-One of the concerns is if CCL can survive without short-term revenue, their balance sheet looks the best compared to their competitors and it's actually not too bad. They have the funds to survive this entire year without revenue. \"Carnival's CEO said the company has enough money to make it through the rest of 2020 without bringing in any revenue.\"\n\n\\-Less than 5 P/E ratio after tanking. Cruises have some pretty good margins (comparing to other industries/businesses). Picture included showcasing the breakdown of costs.\n\n\\-It's executives and Saudi Arabia are extremely confident. \" Carnival director Randall Weisenburger bought a large block of shares in the offering\" (1.25 million shares).\n\n\\-Cruises will likely implement certain rules and actions for future cruises to ensure that customers to minimize the risk of breakouts such as imposing restrictions on those over 70 or pre-existing conditions. Require coronavirus testing of people before embarking, etc.\n\n\\-In a 5-year discounted cash flow EBITDA exit model, assume revenue falling by 50% this year. Sales improve starting in the fiscal year 2023, the CCL stock is worth $19 and also the slightest good news literally pumps this stock up.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ymc4mx3t74t41.png?width=1068&format=png&auto=webp&s=4884432a2b0d0bdb68130f81f53fb354252dee15", "created_utc": 1587015786.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g291o2/buy_ccl_calls_months_out_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
