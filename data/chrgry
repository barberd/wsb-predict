It's as if it shuts off or, more accurately, *scrambles* my intuition. I seem to operate better relying on the information stream of everyday life, only using small pieces of last-minute market research to confirm trades, instead of trying to absorb as much market info as possible and analyze every trade as extensively as I can. I honestly hypothesize that the market is heavily influenced by AI and the AI has a decent ability to hack human brains using malicious patterns in the information stream of the market [much like how human hackers can inject malicious patterns in an information stream to give instructions to a computer]() (on mobile so editing to add link after I post this).\n\nWho else experiences any of this effect I've described and is anyone else here as tinfoil-hatted about it as me?", "created_utc": 1564078914, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/chrgry/why_does_practice_make_me_worse_at_trading/", "is_self": true}
