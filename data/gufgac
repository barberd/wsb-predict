{"id": "gufgac", "title": "Two interesting commodities trades: Go long on coffee and palladium", "selftext": "Soft commodities have been getting hammered recently and rightly so, but the supply chain of coffee is getting hit hard by covid. There will most likely be a supply deficit during the summer since South American countries are getting hit by covid after the Global North, thereby demand will likely rise faster and supply will lag. Coffee prices are trading at a 5 year all-time low so go long on coffee with the ticker symbol JO. \n\nIn the precious metals group, palladium has been hit hard, but Chinese output data that recently came out shows that factories are gearing up again. Once car companies in the US also start rearing to go, palladium prices should naturally rise on the anticipation alone (that's when you sell your calls). UBS's price target for 2nd quarter of 2020 for palladium is at 2300 an ounce, which represents an attractive upside for the current prices. SBSW, a mining company that has a significant palladium exposure, offers a chance to play this as SBSW shares are trading at a key support. The company recently got hammered because of covid cases in its mines, but they have said they will reopen in early June. Therefore, SBSW represents a significant upside compared to other miners. \n\nTLDR: Both tickers have low downside and high upside.
