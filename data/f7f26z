{"id": "f7f26z", "title": "TMDX - a rare opportunity in boomer stocks", "selftext": "**Background**\n\nI work within the industry so I'm posting this from an account I use to argue about video game lore because I'm a fucking nerd and it isn't linked to me at all. I **don't want the SEC to plunge my butthole** so I have to stress that all of the information in my DD is 100% publicly available.\n\n**Company**\n\nTransMedics (TMDX) is a medical technology company which researches and builds devices to better preserve and perfuse recovered organs in order to create better transplant outcomes. \n\nQ4 and FY2019 **earnings out 3/2, large medical conference scheduled 3/3**. Analyst price target for company is $22, currently trading at $18.66.\n\n**The Shill**\n\nBuy TMDX while you can. The upcoming earnings should be good because they sold a decent amount and hospitals were approved to charge off part of the cost of these \\~250k machines on the taxpayer, courtesy of Medicare. The next earnings should be even better thanks to the January sales spurred by the first ever DCD (donation after cardiac death) transplant in the United States facilitated by their premier product, the Organ Care System (OCS).\n\nWhy are DCD hearts a big deal for transplant programs? To put it in perspective, in 2016 there were about 19k brain dead donors and 48k DCD donors. Out of those 48k DCDs, a whopping 0 hearts and less than 240 lungs were recovered for transplant. There are a variety of reasons as to why but I won't bore you because nobody will read this anyway, probably. Essentially, the OCS fixes some of the major problems with DCD heart and lung recoveries and allows for the organs to be perfused immediately after recovery and during transport back to the recipient center.  \n\nOnly 50 or so transplant centers perform 95% of heart and lung transplants. Only 5 centers were enrolled in OCS studies or using their products in early 2019, there are now 18. This is all info you can find via Google btw. They were able to sell about 18 machines and the accompanying single use perfusion sets to just these 5 centers and pull in a cool $5.5 million.\n\nThese machines are now FDA approved for routine use, multiple centers have bought them and integrated them into their routine operations, an additional heart study and a liver study is ongoing still. These centers are eager to increase their transplant rates and thus increase their revenue, they're getting these expensive machines at a discount courtesy of Uncle Sam (and us), more centers than ever are involved in operations using these machines. Most of this happened at the end of 2019 or early this year.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI don't what the fuck the analysts are smoking with a price target of $22. Again, these machines cost **around $250k per** and their **single use perfusion sets cost at least over $10k**, now that they're actually moving their product, they will be making bank. \n\nIt won't 2x overnight but this shit will absolutely be worth a lot more than it is today, this time next year if this trend keeps up. Also of note, United Therapeutics recently acquired Lung Bioengineering, a company who makes a similar machine but is solely focused on ex-vivo lung perfusion. There is a not insignificant chance that UTHR might be looking to buy out TMDX at some point in the future. Finally, this isn't financial advice, I don't work for this company and I do own a handful of shares as of this posting.\n\n**tldr**\n\n2019 ipo, will probably rise into earnings 3/2, big conference 3/3, could potentially moon by eoy, **there are no options** for this but if you autismos can profit off of lumber fucking liquidators thanks to an increase in volume, you can probably profit here too\n\n**sources**\n\n[google.com](https://google.com)", "created_utc": 1582308594, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7f26z/tmdx_a_rare_opportunity_in_boomer_stocks/", "is_self": true}
