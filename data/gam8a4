DOWJ and SP major companies aren\u2019t completely reliant on people going outside, APPL will continue to sell through online retail and they have increasingly moved towards subscription based services which will have high quarterly profits. Amazon is a company completely reliant on people being lazy and not going outside and they are a massive part of the SP, in fact Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Facebook make up a little under 25% according to CNBC as of January 27, 2020. This means that a majority of the SP doesn\u2019t give a fuck if the world is falling apart as long as people subscribe and continue buying technology to jerk off with. (Fun fact Friend Finders ticker is FFN if you wanna YOLO that)\n\n2. Unemployment doesn\u2019t matter, correlation doesn\u2019t equal causation. People will tell you that high unemployment rates come with a market crash and yes that is necessarily true, but that doesn\u2019t mean that unemployment causes financial crisis, I would argue that it is a byproduct rather than an indication of financial ruin. Also Unemployment is at record highs not because of incorrect valuation of stocks not because of shitty subprime loans, it\u2019s at a record high because people can\u2019t work because of the virus. This record high unemployment rate will go down.\n\n3. The Treasury is a whore. You put enough money into an economy it will run forever. Adding to the fact that it gets written off as federal spending our budget and other items don\u2019t drop. Our GDP will drop a little but the Treasury can hold the economy up on his back.\n\nTLDR: Bulls are right, Bears are wrong.
