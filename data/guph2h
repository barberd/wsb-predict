It's a good story to share with others when they lose perspective on the value of WSB.\n\nSince the riots, there has been a large number of \"short insurance\" threads.      \n\n\n [https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/search/?q=insurance&restrict\\_sr=1](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/search/?q=insurance&restrict_sr=1)   \n\n\nPeruse those threads, think about the analysis, and then read this article.  \n\n\n PCS from verisk/maplecroft, which is the best service for covering insurance issues has a good article here -  [https://www.reinsurancene.ws/pcs-designates-mn-riots-a-catastrophe-warns-of-loss-potential/](https://www.reinsurancene.ws/pcs-designates-mn-riots-a-catastrophe-warns-of-loss-potential/)   \n\n\nThan look at the top re-insurance tickers, here -  [https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/ca/news/breaking-news/here-are-the-top-10-reinsurance-companies-in-the-world-189207.aspx](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/ca/news/breaking-news/here-are-the-top-10-reinsurance-companies-in-the-world-189207.aspx)   \n\n\nThen look at how they traded today.\n\nSo for those folks who called out \"reinsurance\", I'd advise that you follow them on reddit.   They are among the more clueful around here.  \n\n\nBut by and large, most people on WSB simply posted very ignorant advice on a deeply complex topic.  Many of them claimed to \"be in insurance\" as well and recommended against the trade.   Look how well their advice played out.  \n\n\nReality is, there are very specialized traders who likely track this type of news and have sophisticated models which allow them to make reasoned trades.   They understand the exposure and offsetting of liabilities.  They probably knew who insured Target and Apple and other  stores that got hit and who their re-insurers are and how much of their profit/revenue would suffer from this.  \n\n\nThat level of sophistication is beyond the capability of anyone on WSB.   So, in this case, everyone was likely well over their head.   What's more, a lot of these tickers will trade on european markets as the re-insurers, other than berk, are not in the US.   Also, pre-market trading is likely where all the action is because it happened over the weekend.    \n\n\nNow, that's not to say we couldn't have made the reinsurance trade.  I think we could have on friday EOD when it became clear to folks here who had a good feel for the vibe on the street.   We're dialed into that around here.   The trick is to connect that intuition with some real analysis.     \n\n\n If you're into that sort of combined intuition and analysis and want someone to discuss it with, tag me in a thread and I'll  be happy to jump in if there is time.  \n\n(For the record, I recommended reinsurance here - [https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gu16n8/shorts\\_leaps\\_on\\_insurers/fsg94hb?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gu16n8/shorts_leaps_on_insurers/fsg94hb?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x))", "created_utc": 1591034558.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/guph2h/a_good_example_of_how_wsb_can_get_in_over_its_head/", "is_self": true}
