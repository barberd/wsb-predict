The mortgage bankers association has reached out to FINRA and the SEC for reduced regulations in regards to margin calls in order to prevent further destabilization.\n\nThe letter went on to say, \u201cMargin calls on mortgage lenders reached staggering and unprecedented levels by the end of the week. For a significant number of lenders, many of which are well-capitalized, these margin calls are eroding their working capital and threatening their ability to continue to operate.\u201d\n\nThe Fed has another scheduled 40 billion purchase tomorrow.\n\nIn short the Fed is fucked if they do and fucked if they don't.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/29/mortgage-bankers-warn-fed-purchases-of-mortgages-unbalanced-market-forcing-margin-calls.html\n\n\n4/17 200p\n\nI'd tag this as DD but I'm om mobile and can't figure this shit out\n\nTLDR: TLDR The Fed is buying mortgage backed securities to provide liquidity to the market. In doing so, they've blown out hedges that normally wouldn't have been blown out. This is causing mortgage lenders to use up their working capital for margin calls rather than lending. This is the opposite of what the Fed wants to have happen.\n\nEdit; For those of you who are indicating that the link doesn't work... Sorry... I'm actually autistic and can't figure this shit out\nJust search for it on cnbc\n\nStay tuned for a more in depth post by u/HowGreatAreYourDanes", "created_utc": 1585534238.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/friaev/the_fed_is_causing_another_housing_crisis/", "is_self": true}
