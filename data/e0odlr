{"id": "e0odlr", "title": "Possible to sell covered calls through RobinHood when shares are held by another broker?", "selftext": "Ok my question is whether it is possible to link two brokerage accounts so that I can sell covered calls from my RH account when the shares are actually held in my Schwab account. I did a quick search and couldn't find a definite answer, I feel like this is definitely not allowed but I figured I'd ask here. I don't like holding actual shares in my RH account because I only use it to lose tendies on FDs but I want to try my hand at writing some options.
