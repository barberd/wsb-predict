Or at least overpriced?", "selftext": "I think TSLA is a great company and that they will grow a lot in the future but their current market cap is suoer high and is almost the same as much bigger companies, so this price also includes all the future growth, it may keep going since stock price is based on supply and demand and not the value of the company(even if that influences the bid and ask prices), so since the hype around TSLA is super high rn I think that the price on TSLA is high, bit idk if it will settle in the future and wipe out people who jumped on the train too late.\n\nWhat do you think?", "created_utc": 1578501389, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/elv35v/is_tsla_a_bubble_or_at_least_overpriced/", "is_self": true}
