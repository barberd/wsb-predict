{"id": "cnubwv", "title": "Amrn gets an adcom. FDA asks to not release news...", "selftext": "So Amrn got an adcom today which tanked it's price 25%ah. Usually adcoms don't happen a month before the pdufa date. I was ok the investor call and the CEO claims that fda did not move the pdufa date. He also claims that FDA asked them to not release the news to the public. I find this rather strange that they would ask material information not be released. Could this be FDA trying to tell AMRN that they'll receive a partial label in September? Any thoughts?", "created_utc": 1565309104, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cnubwv/amrn_gets_an_adcom_fda_asks_to_not_release_news/", "is_self": true}
