People will not be switching from Coke to water.\n\nThink about it. You'll stop shopping for a new computer, a new house, a new iPhone, and a new Tesla. But fatso Americans will continue to guzzle 2000 bottles of coke per household (guessing but probably).  \n\nMarket cap is only $229 billion. Could easily be $300 to $350 increasing stock price by up to 50% to like $75/share.\n\nIt's a slow mover but it is a safe patriotic company. $55 is all-time high (last $53.54). After that sky is the limit. It also pays you 3% to hold it which is a nice touch.", "created_utc": 1565799892, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cqc0h2/if_dumb_enough_to_long_stocks_with_great/", "is_self": true}
