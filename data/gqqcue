You\u2019ve probably thought.... damn if I just got me a little slice of those \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b tendies on $LK I could buy a Maserati just like my wife\u2019s boyfriend has. But you are a raging bull and just couldn\u2019t muster up enough gayness to buy puts. Well pop a handful of skittles and taste the rainbow with $CKLD. This CCP house of cards is days away from going tits up and I\u2019ll tell you why. \n\nThey mass produce traditional Chinese Medical therapies. Yes like bat soup. But the CFO of this dog, Sum Ting Wong, is balls deep in sourcing Bok Choy for literally all of their products. No bats. No rats. No Dog Anus. No Feline Ovaries. And yes, no Eel Semen. That shits expensive. Bok Choy is cheap as fuck and this dude is no country bumpkin rice farmer. He knows these therapies are total bullshit so what\u2019s the difference between a Goat Testy and a vegetable, right? \n\nYou may be asking yourself, how does this guy know this and why should I trust him with my tendies? I\u2019ll tell you why. Ever hear of the German journalist Bastian Obermayer? Yes that guy. The guy who broke the Panama Papers. See back in the day when Sum Ting Wong was in college, he found himself struggling financially as many students do. And as many students do, he did some things he\u2019s not proud of. Obermayer was in Shanghai studying at the same University. Wong was about 500 yuan short of making rent for his apartment and was sobbing dragon sized tears to Bastian about it. Now we all know Germans are into some sick shit so Obermayer asked Wong \u201cuza eever heer uva bukkake?\u201d Wong was basically like of course you crazy German fuck, I\u2019m Asian we all know about that crazy shit. Well it just so happened that Obermayer knew the founder of JM Productions, Jeff Steward, and told Wong they pay 500 yuan to be in one of their videos. Wong being desperate, agreed. \n\nSo we have Bok Choy, Bukkake, Panama Papers but if that\u2019s not enough, consider this. Jeff Steward was up late recently waiting for his Ambien to kick in and saw Wong on Mad Money pumping up some fake Bat Flu remedy. Recognizing him from the video from years ago he called him and told him he would go to the press with the Bukkake video if he didn\u2019t wire 10,000,000 by Tuesday. My bet is Wong jumps off the top of their headquarters in Shanghai in fear of being publicly humiliated. \n\nTL;DR $CKLD $5 6/19p because you can\u2019t miss out on the next $LK\n\nDisclosure: I\u2019ve been drinking and I am not a financial advisor.
