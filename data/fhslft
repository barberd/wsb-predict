{"id": "fhslft", "title": "Noob concerned about selling put options.. take it easy on me.", "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI'm still very new to this and I think I may have made a mistake. I purchased two put options on Robinhood.\n\n---------------------\nGE stock price is currently $7.23:\n\nOne was $294 spent on a 3/20 GE $7 Put option. \n\nOther was for $24 spent on a 3/20 GE $6 Put option. \n\n---------------------\n\nThey are set to expire next week on Friday. I am expecting the stock I placed the put options on to go down in value below the strike price, maybe even the second one ($6) if things really get ugly but expected that might expire worthless and said yolo & goodbye to my $24. \n\n**I thought this was fairly simple with buying puts.. buy the put option.. the more the stock price tanks toward my option the higher the value my option will go and I can sell it back for the difference in premium at any time .etc or Robinhood automatically does it for me at expiration.**\n\nMy question is: I've come across users getting assigned and owing tens of thousands of dollars without meaning to. How did they get here? I've read that the only reason that happened is they Sold puts without Buying puts first?\n\nPlease feel free to tell me how dumb I am at getting into options taking without fully understanding what it was I'm doing. I completely understand and am now watching a YT series on such, I'm just fairly scared and am looking to solidify my mistake and understand.\n\nThanks Reddit", "created_utc": 1584066923.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhslft/noob_concerned_about_selling_put_options_take_it/", "is_self": true}
