Our new orders are down 80%+ from last year this time.  Service orders are down 55%+  We have a footprint into the consumer, as most of our products helps to get product from truck to store to consumer.  This also applies to the non-brick and mortar.  Think of why big name(s) have back-log on orders, think its really due to delivery?  Demand destruction!  VIX is the canary in the coalmine.  Gold isn't even safe, and when Tudor Jones rings the bitcoin bell, take note!  There is NO HEDGE to liquidity demand!  Can't print our way out of excessive debt!  \n\nEven if we get people back to work, someone needs to chart the psychology of the consumer which faces risks of infection.  Deflation will come b/c of the lack of demand!  Listen to earnings calls, companies are NOT providing guidance!  WHY?  9/12/14c SPXS 6/19,  painfully, 60% of portfolio sitting in GLD til storm calms.  Occasional calls, no more than 2% breakeven on SPY on down days.  There are no technical\"s\" for what we are witnessing with monster FED put!", "created_utc": 1589568708.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gkf1u4/supply_chain_large_metro_city/", "is_self": true}
