I have quite a heavy gambling addiction which translates to trading with leverage etc.\n\nWell a week ago I had my last few grands on a GOLD long position. I opened it at 1409 and it stopped out on the last dip to 1401 or so before it took off to 1500 right now. I was just a 1$ dollar difference and I would have been out of a huge debt I build up over the years gambling.\n\nHow can I cope with this fucked up feeling? It's eating my alive. \n\nI know that this is not the right sub, but I hope some of you guys can relate either way.", "created_utc": 1565776115, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cq7g7w/dealing_with_a_what_if_situation/", "is_self": true}
