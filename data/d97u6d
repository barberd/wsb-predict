DD Below", "selftext": "Disclaimer: I am in the real estate/estate development space.\n\nKBH has seen steady growth in it's construction rate in the recent two years. The business is not only profitable, but also a lot of potential left for expansion into southern and northern California (I use CA as a primary example as housing market is most active, attractive, and profitable in this area). \n\nIn previous quarters, KBH has met and exceeded expectations for ER and maintained a steady track to meet all of it's guidance. Granted the previous two quarters, KBH was mostly in it's construction phase and fed mortgage cuts did not take into full effect, the market would not have been ideal - yet, it beat expectations. Currently, we are in the selling phase. I know this. Don't SEC me. If we zoom into CA, KBH has listed over 500 properties across four major cities in the Bay Area. The homes sold out in under a year. Profit margins are not tremendous as space is expensive for development, and cost of materials have also gone up with employment as well - nonetheless, we are talking about 500 properties all within the 800k-1.5M range. This is in the Bay Area in four major cities alone. Other areas I cannot account for, but in CA alone, the revenue is probably tremendous. \n\nLast note. Please take a look into the Revenue to Market cap ratio. We are looking at a forward REVENUE of 25.52%, meaning higher annual revenue than the market cap. Don't see this a lot with a stock in this value range.", "created_utc": 1569438011, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d97u6d/kbh_is_a_buy_dd_below/", "is_self": true}
