{"id": "fu4v31", "title": "Questrade Killed John Lennon", "selftext": "On December 8, 1980, John Lennon had 5 bullets fired at him by Mark David Chapman, killing him instantly. Chapman's Wikipedia page says, \"Chapman began to fantasize about having king-like power over a group of...\"little people\" who lived in the walls of his bedroom.\"\n\nFast forward almost 30 years, one of our own experiences an almost-identical situation. For each bullet Lennon was shot with, he loses $10K, adding up to a total of $50K by a company that also fantasizes about having power over the people by sending lawyers after him. Ignoring the fact that they have never explicitly come out and said that they did not kill Lennon, my inside sources (my big brain) say the company also collectively masturbates every time someone loses money because their service is down.\n\nQUESTRADE?
