Meanwhile there are test shortages across the country.\n\nThis number lags behind the true case rate due to testing and reporting delays.\n\nMany individual states, like NY, NJ, CA, etc. are on track to be Italy 2.0. As a country, we will most likely see cases and deaths many times that of Italy.\n\nThink we're getting a hold on it? Think this'll blow over in a couple weeks? I assure you that is not the case. Any sort of vaccine that would put a measurable dent in new cases is minimum 6 months out.\n\nChloroquine, Remdesevir, and all the other drugs gaining traction in the media are therapeutic treatments, meaning they may only put a small dent in the total death rate and boost recovery time. Neither of these matter when the Hospitals are full (re: Italy) and the healthcare system collapses.\n\nSPY 4/10 200p, SQQQ 33c 4/17, etc. Puts on any company not Corona proof.\n\nEDIT: And its up since posting to ~~4.1k~~ 4.6k new cases today (from 2.6k)\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1584653741.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fliccs/new_covid19_case_numbers_nearly_doubled_today_17k/", "is_self": true}
