{"id": "fqpbnb", "title": "Stop Buying Expensive Options On Obvious Plays: How IV Steals Your Tendies", "selftext": "I've seen these trades a few too many times, so I figured it's about time to explain why you should give a damn about 'ivy' and what it means for an option to be expensive. This is a lesson on efficient capital allocation.\n\n**Where do options come from?**\n\n\nThere's no free lunch. The market is not perfectly efficient (it is certainly possible to make money), but it is pretty damn close. What this means is that 'obvious' plays are priced to limit your upside.\n\nWhy is this the case? Transactions are symmetric -- whenever you buy an option, someone is selling it to you. Depending on what you're buying, it's either another trader, or a market maker. When trading highly liquid options, it's usually a market maker (think Jane Street or Citadel), whereas if you're trading an unknown, small company, it's probably another trader (Jane Street is not going to bother with *Lumber Liquidators*). But, irrespective of who is selling it to you, they're in it to make a *profit.\n\n**IV**\n\n\nWhat does this mean? The money-making opportunity is usually priced into the option premium. A **4/9 220p** on SPY currently has an IV of 83.44%. A **4/9 30p** on RCL (roughly comparable percentage price decrease on the strike) has an IV of 319.70%! Do you think that Royal Caribbean is about to plummet because they have negative cashflow and don't qualify for the bailout? Yeah, well *so does the market*. It's written right there, in the IV. That's what IV is -- implied volatility, the expected volatility, according to the market. In order to make a huge return from trading the RCL put, RCL would need to drop even more than the market currently expects it to... With an IV of 319.70%, that doesn't seem particularly likely. So, should you buy RCL puts? Probably not... Unless you believe that you know something that the market does not, in which case, your claim would be that the RCL put, despite an IV of 319.70%, is still 'underpriced'. If you think that you have knowledge that justifies more IV than is currently priced in, then enter the trade.\n\nFundamentally, **IV is forcing you to pay for the privilege of profiting from the volatility of the underlying**. It has to be set up this way, because option sellers need to be sufficiently incentivised to take the risk of writing an option on something as 'risky' as RCL. Remember, your gain is their loss -- they're only going to enter the trade if you pay handsomely upfront.\n\nRight now, everything has 'high' IV, Vix is through the roof. When Vix eventually drops, everything will be IV crushed. But options on individual stocks still have more/less IV priced in, as dependent on how much the market expects them to move. Picking the 'obvious' candidates with the highest IV is unlikely to result in a very profitable trade. In many cases, simply buying a put on SPY would pay more over the course of a red day.\n\n\n**But I want big gains...**\n\n\nThis is why most of the 'real money' from this crash has already been made. The select few who purchased puts when SPY was trading above 300 made out like bandits -- capturing 10-30x returns. They bought their puts before the rest of the market realized that the crash was coming, so they didn't pay for the volatility and the coronavirus repercussions were not yet priced into the option premiums. Is it still possible to make a profit? Definitely. Some believe that the coronavirus crisis is 'overblown', so the market is still pricing uncertainty about further downside into the puts. 3-4x+ gains could still happen. If you buy puts now and enjoy a 200% return, it is only because of all of the entities underestimating the economic damage wrought by the virus. Assuming that the market continues crashing, it will be possible to turn a profit until the last bull capitulates (no coincidence that this is when the crash will end).\n\nSo how do you make 'big' (10-30x) plays? You have to know something that the market doesn't yet realize. If betting on SPY, you have buy puts before everyone realizes that the world is burning (too late, unless the damage is significantly more severe than the market has priced in -- SPY 145p, for example). The next big trade will be calling a lower bottom, or calling the trend reversion before anyone else realizes (buy calls at the bottom while hedging vega, or after volatility has dropped). In the realm of individual companies -- you'd have to pick a company that will suffer more than the market realizes, or a company that will thrive in the virus-wracked economy.\n\nSo, no, there is no free lunch. Sorry. If you identify a company that is 'sure to plummet', make sure that the market doesn't already know that.\n\n\n\n**TLDR:**\nIf you think a coronavirus play is obvious, check that this isn't already priced into the option's premium. When the market expects a company to swing wildly, it'll be right there, in the premium. This is why SPY puts can pay more on a 4% move than RCL puts would on a 14% move.\n\n\n**Market makers don't actually profit from betting on trades -- they have an entirely different business model, based on capturing rebates from bid/ask spreads... They earn a commission from facilitating trades, basically. But options that market makers sell are still priced by the market, and thus priced so that the transaction represents 'fair value'.*", "created_utc": 1585419258.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqpbnb/stop_buying_expensive_options_on_obvious_plays/", "is_self": true}
