{"id": "g50hth", "title": "what's the bull case on wingstop now?", "selftext": "Wingstop is at all-time highs with a PE ratio of 155 (!!!). It's a fucking chicken wing restaurant in the middle of a pandemic. They released some bullshit pre-earnings and had a solid delivery business pre-pandemic, but they also missed expectations in Q4 2019, and, again, this is a restaurant with a PE ratio of 155. Who the fuck is buying a fast-casual food service growth play at 155x in this pandemic?  The wings aren't even very good. Anyone have an idea what the bull case is here? \n\n$WING p100 7/17", "created_utc": 1587414330.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g50hth/whats_the_bull_case_on_wingstop_now/", "is_self": true}
