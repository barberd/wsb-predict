Well these are all radically different markets (especially now) and this is actually WAY more conservative than even their USL fund. Which means any run up on WTI crude prices will see very little transfer to your USO gain. Basically the entire freaking curve has to move up at the same time if you want to make any money. \n\nSo you open up and see the front-month WTI crude contract has shot through the roof on May 15th, you get all excited and can't wait to sell out and rake in those sweet massive profits, only to see USO barely moved because all their positions are spread out across different crude grades and also gasoline and diesel prices!\n\nSo if you have calls, sorry to say your gains have now had their legs cut out from underneath them. You could be a 100% right on your WTI prediction but not see shit for gains. Haha remember when this was sold as a FRONT MONTH WTI CRUDE FUND. This doesn't seem fair for anyone on either the call OR put side.", "created_utc": 1588320281.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gbe3tp/uso_etf_no_longer_tracking_wti_crude_only/", "is_self": true}
