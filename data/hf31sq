LOAD UP ON SPY CALLS JUST LIKE I DID BOIS 322 C 7/31 GOING TO THE FUCKING MOON \ud83c\udf1d \ud83d\ude80. JPOWS ON HIS MAGICAL PONY EXPRESS MONEY GO BURR TRAIN CHANGING THE INK. \n\nI\u2019m going to state some obvious factual information on why STONKS ONLY GO UP. \n\nFirst off we need to understand how PRINTER GO BURR. According to this link I found it will take 833 page prints until an ink refill is needed. \n\nhttps://www.tonergiant.co.uk/blog/2014/08/how-many-pages-will-my-cartridge-print-before-it-runs-out/\n\nSecond. We will then have to approximate how many Hundoes are on each page. According to the mints website there are about 50 bills per page. Let\u2019s do a little math equation to piece it all together. \n\n50 bills x 833 pages per ink cartridge x 100 dollars per bill comes out to $4,165,000\n\n\nhttps://www.tonergiant.co.uk/blog/2014/08/how-many-pages-will-my-cartridge-print-before-it-runs-out/\n\n\nFinally when you take into account all of the printers working simultaneously and work out the numbers according to this information you will realize that the Fed prints over $14,000,000 per day every day of the year. \n\n\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/coin_currency_orders.htm\n\n\nTaking all that into account we now know that each printer THAT GOES BURR has the ability to print 1.4 M dollars, times that by 12 (the amount of federal reserves) and then divide it by the amount of time it takes for all printers to need a refill and you\u2019ll realize that this usually happens once every 9 day\u2019s or so. \n\nLooking back at the DOW the last time we were at 25,500 was EXACTLY 9 DAYS AGO AND THERE FOR IT WILL ONLY GO UP.
