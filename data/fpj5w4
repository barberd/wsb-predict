I know everyone who has puts has gotten fucked by a giant green dildo thanks to the stimulus, but here\u2019s THE play: College students have gotten utterly fucked by this stimulus. Basically, you are allowed to claim your children as dependents until they are 24 if they are full time students. This is an extremely common tax advantage. Technically, the parent is supposed to pay 50% of expenses, but this excludes funding from scholarships, grants, and student margin. Additionally this is not something the IRS ever questions, so everyone does it. The rebate specifically excludes dependents over 17 (you won\u2019t even get the $500). This means that all the servers and retail workers who\u2019s scummy parents claimed them as a dependent, and lives off a combination of tips and student loans, and who just got laid off not only can\u2019t claim unemployment but they won\u2019t get ANY stimulus money. Not only that, but they can\u2019t even sublet their overpriced student housing lease because classes are online until fall so there is no demand. \n\nThat being said, congress made sure to give all the retired boomers who are living on fixed income anyways and are completely unaffected the full $1200. Thankfully all the college students who are going to get fucked by this will be paying taxes for the rest of their lives to pay off the extra $2 trillion in debt that they won\u2019t even get a piece of. GG boomers, well played\n\nTLDR: ACC 5/15 30p.
