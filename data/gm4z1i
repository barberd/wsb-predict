{"id": "gm4z1i", "title": "12 PT Upgrades on Jd.com since earnings on Friday, and JD.com proves it's relatively COVID-19-proof", "selftext": "Excellent earnings and guidance provided by JD, has resulted in most of the analysts covering JD increasing price targets, ranging from +$4 to +$14. \n\nCurrently up 7%(\\~12:345pm EST), with BABA and PDD earnings expected on Friday, which will impact JD (TBD on direction).\n\nPrice target changes from analysts in last few days:\n\n* $67 from $53 at UBS\n* $59 from $52 at Goldman Sachs\n* $50 from $43 at Stifel\n* $60 from $56 at Citi\n* $62 from $58 at Mizuho\n* $64 from $54 at Nomura\n* $60 from $55 at HSBC\n* $59 from $50 at Barclays\n* $55 From $51 by Bocom International\n* $62 From $58 by Mizuho\n* $66 from $60 at Benchmark\n* $60 from $51 at Bank of America\n\nAs a reminder, the current environment for trading Chinese ADRs is dangerous, largely due to:  \n1) Negative investor sentiment related to recent accounting scandals  \n2) Anti-China political environment, with potential negative actions expected from Trump Administration, that may result in indirect impacts (economy) or direct (impacting US listed companies)\n\n  \nIn the long term, [JD.com](https://JD.com) is very well-positioned to avoid impact from the above actions:  \n\\- They are almost entirely focused on the Chinese market, with limited exposure to SE Asia (so minimal impact from global economic downturn, now that China is up and running)  \n\\- They are are a large net importer of agricultural products from the US, regularly importing $ billions in agricultural products, so they will likely benefit from incentives from Chinese government to meet the Phase 1 Trade deal requirements (that China has committed to meeting)  \n\\- They are already following US accounting rules (GAAP), as do most large Chinese companies with ADRs in the US  \n\\- They have a large cash position, and based on their past experience in continuing acquisitions, they may make strategic and lucrative investments during the pandemic period\n\nHOWEVER, as you all should know, sentiment is often detached from reality, and any anti-China actions, rhetoric, disappointing results from BABA/PDD (likely), and even drops in S&P (despite being completely disconnected from what JD is doing in China), will likely result in JD stock price falling. Sure, JD may spike in the next few weeks, but it is dangerous to hold over the summer, and will likely be dragged down from any negative news.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Disclaimer:** I have been following JD for years, and have posted prior DD (see post history) on JD's recent performance. I have started to reduce my exposure/lock in profits, and will transition to safer options. This is a subjective opinion, do not take it as professional investment advice. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:** [Jd.com](https://Jd.com) continues to be a great long-term growth investment, and has recently had a stellar quarter, followed by a slew of upgrades. It is sensitive to a number of indirect market factors, so it is dangerous to trade in the near-to-medium term. Do not risk any money you're not willing to lose. Recommendation:   \n\\- Post your gains, and lock in the profits  \n\\- Reduce your exposure and wind down your high-risk option positions on JD in next few weeks  \n\\- Maybe buy stock or itm far-out call options", "created_utc": 1589820099.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gm4z1i/12_pt_upgrades_on_jdcom_since_earnings_on_friday/", "is_self": true}
