The all powerful MMs have already determined when the next leg down begins: Friday, July 24th. \n\nThe market\u2019s temporary bottom was reached on March 23rd. Since then we\u2019ve experienced a relatively steady climb up. MMs have already begun training our autistic monkey brains to give up on puts and buy the dip. Many people expect tomorrow/sometime this week to be the start of the next leg down as the economy starts opening back up, but they will be sorely disappointed. The MMs will start pumping again and the trend will continue up. Many long term puts will also expire on May 15th. By then, MMs have already made their next move and it\u2019s based on social psychology. \n\nIt takes approximately 66 days to build a habit, and the MMs learned this social psychology fact accidentally by dropping in on college zoom seminars to spy on college babes (ps that\u2019s why \ud83c\udf08 zoom has been propped up for so long). After May 15th, majority of bears will have been wiped out and also learn to BTFD starting the following Monday on May 18th. 66 days from May 18th is Thursday, July 23 when another jobless report will be announced, where we have 70% unemployment and the market will subsequently moon 6.9% up. But the MMs have chosen the next day, July 24th as the day of the rug pull because by then, the majority of the market will have already helplessly learned to be in calls.\n\nThis urge to buy the dip will be so strong that unfortunately even by me taking all this time to explain this insidious mental manipulation by MMs, 99% of you will still uncontrollably click to buy spy420 calls before market close on July 23rd.\n\nI feel sorry for you guys but mostly for myself, because even I won\u2019t be able to break the trance...\n\nGodspeed autists, Godspeed \ud83c\udf7b", "created_utc": 1588555859.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gd2f8v/why_wsb_will_continue_to_lose_tendies_the_mms/", "is_self": true}
