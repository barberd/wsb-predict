No. The Federal Reserve has been trying to avoid recessions for the last 30 years. They've done a lot of weird shit. They always fail. But after failure comes success. They will finally get it right. \n\nNext FOMC meeting you will hear J. Pow say \"We engineered the market to give you 100% yearly returns. It's basically gonna move up in a straight line forever.\"   \n \nWhat you do is you buy now. Every month from here on out you gain 10%. Warren Buffet likes 10% a year. Pussy shit. SPY 100% a year. SPXL 300% a year. Thank you Fed.", "created_utc": 1573090920, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dsqc05/the_spy_rallied_up_almost_10_in_one_month_dd/", "is_self": true}
