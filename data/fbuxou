One day a failed real-estate borrower calls him up and says \"I need a bigly economy, yuuuge numbers\" and even though he has an indefinite appointment (which Yellen was not afraid to swing that big thing around), he gets down on his knees to put his lips on the micro mushroom tip. He enacts the most pro-cyclical policies of any Federal Reserve chair ever, with three rate cuts during periods of record unemployment and stock market growth. \"But why is GDP growth so weak? All the proles have jobs!\" he thinks, unable to correlate even the simplest of indicators. \"Oh well\" he thinks, on his way to the next rate cut announcement. \"At least daddy won't tweet bad things about me. And I'll always have that 20% growth in calendar year 19.\" \n\nWhat a pussy.", "created_utc": 1583073767, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fbuxou/jerome_powell_is_a_fucking_cumstain_hes_half_the/", "is_self": true}
