Fear not, I am letting you in on an industry secret. All the big boys use something called AA (Astro-Analysis). \n\nUnlike TA, you have to be extremely intelligent to understand AA. Even Hawkings and Einstein could only settle for astronomy.\n\nAlso unlike TA, AA can only predict long term trends, much like Buffett. Here are the moves for 2020 as I observe the skies. If you don't understand what I'm talking about you will just have to get a PhD in Astro-Analysis from my certified training course for $42069. Sorry guys.\n\n**Facebook, (FB)**: Transiting Jupiter would aspect 5 planets during the year 2020,  including friends Moon, Mars ans Sun. This stock is therefore at the top of my list.\n\n**Biogen, (BIIB)**: Here also transiting Jupiter is aspecting natal Moon, jupiter and Sun. I therefore believe this stock would do good in 2020.\n\n**Extra Space Storage, (EXR)**: This is a Real Estate Investment Trust, paying about 3.5% dividend. Transiting Jupiter aspects 6 planets.\n\n**Enphase Energy, (ENPH)**: This is a solar stock and has a strong Moon in the astro-chart. It therefore moves in a very cyclical pattern. I think the transit of Jupiter aspecting strong natal Moon and Venus can produce good uptrend in prices.\n\n**Exelon Corp, (EXC)**: Although the natal planets in the astro-chart of this company are not as strong as in FB or ENPH, yet the transit of Jupiter influencing almost every natal planet can produce good results.\n\n**WIX.com, (WIX)**: Transiting Jupiter moves over Venus and aspects Mars and Jupiter. This therefore can give better results than many stocks.\n\n**Valero Energy (VLO)**: Energy stocks have been lagging for a few years. From astrology point of view, this stock has the best chart. Transiting Jupiter aspects exalted natal Moon.\n\n**Amazon.com (AMZN)**: The transiting Jupiter aspects 5 natal planets including friends Sun, Moon and Mars. I can therefore can expect good gains from Amazon this year.\n\n**Starbux Corp (SBUX)**: This is my all time favorite stock. The transit Jupiter touches many natal planets. I hope this gives me good results in 2020.\n\n**Mallinckrodt, plc (MNK)**: This stock has been beaten down to unimaginable level due to attack of the short sellers. The transiting planets indicate that this stock could recover to produce some respectable results.\n\nYou see. No arguing about arbitrary lines that any autist can draw on a piece of paper.
