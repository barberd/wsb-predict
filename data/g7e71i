Horrible anecdotal DD inside", "selftext": "Chegg is basically where it was at before the coronavirus market crash when it should be way up.\n\n- Analysts downgraded the stock and lowered earnings \n- Analysts said this was because colleges allowed more P/NP grading systems which lower incentives to get good grades\n\nBut from what I have seen based on being in student meme groups:\n\n- Students are cheating WAAAAAY more because classes are online\n- Students who were previously only cheating on homework are now cheating on tests in real time\n- All assignments and tests can be cheated on, vastly increasing the value proposition from Chegg\n- The number of academic integrity referrals are absolutely through the roof\n- Student store is closed so the only way to get textbooks is online\n\nThis should be one of the stocks that are booming higher because of the virus, but has not broken out yet. Who are you going to trust - JP Morgan or someone in facebook student meme groups?
