I had no idea what the hell I was doing other than the stock was about to skyrocket, which it did until everything got fucked by COVID. Then the merger happened and now I really have no idea what I am doing. \n\nMy \"total return\" went down to -$700 at one point. Total return finally got out of the negatives today as the stock rallied big time and now my total return is at +$120. What I am especially confused by is the current price vs. the break even price. The \"current price\" is listed at $0.95 while the \"break even\" price is $10.83. So does that mean I need about a 1,100% increase in order to break even? If that is the case then how can my total return be at +$120. \n\nMy final question is when do you think I should sell these? There is no way I can afford 1000 shares at the current TMUS price of $102.", "created_utc": 1589831871.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gm8v3u/can_someone_help_me_understand_what_i_am_looking/", "is_self": true}
