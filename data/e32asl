Now I have to figure out a new way to stick it to the tax man. Apparently if you donate to eligible non-profits you can deduct that shit (EAT A DONGUS IRS!!!)\n\nI saw a post a few weeks ago donating a sum of money to Autism Speaks. That seems like the perfect charity for us. Although, I'd be open to a different charity. \n\nIt would be cool if we made a coordinated effort to donate. Autists helping autists :) \n\nCan this happen? Are you all too poor?\n\nTL;DR We should donate to a charity.
