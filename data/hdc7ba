{"id": "hdc7ba", "title": "NKLA put holders are fucked", "selftext": "The amount of NKLA bear circle jerk on this sub is fucking hilarious. Retards acting like a massive drop this week is a foregone conclusion. You dont know what you're doing, the put premiums mean you *will* get fucked, and you've clearly learned nothing about these retard meme stocks. Valuations dont matter with a stock like NKLA. You are not intelligent because you regurgitate some nonsense about Holmes and Theranos. A big juicy short squeeze is in the cards and any WSB with puts is going to be left with a gaping asshole. Y'all sound *exactly* like the SPY 180 5/15 half wits did. Screaming and cursing as the market continued to rally. Stocks do NOT have to follow your internal logic. In fact, they are entirely independent of any of your thoughts or expectations.\n\nIf you dont believe in the company and have no desire to invest in it, that's entirely understandable. Just stay away from it. Stop buying puts, you're burning your money\n\nEdit: since I should have known people think I'm bagholding at $90. I have a small number of shares at a cost basis of $35. I hold no options on NKLA.", "created_utc": 1592765403.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hdc7ba/nkla_put_holders_are_fucked/", "is_self": true}
