{"id": "g4sof5", "title": "Meat, poultry, egg and agriculture future looking dim.", "selftext": "Processing plants are closing (Smithfield in SD and one Tyson plant in IA are shut down and another that I linked is on it's way.) and there is going to be more animals coming out of Barns than the remaining factories can handle. These animals will become worthless to the producer once they get too big.(they will begin eating more food then they can put on in fat/meat and will cost more money than they are worth at the market that they can't even get into)  They will shoot them before they pay them past the point of profitability. we are talking about tens of thousands of animals a day being rejected and potentially hundreds of thousands of animals being euthanized. This means products like Tyson pork and chicken not being on the grocery store shelves. Or Smithfield products such as sausages and bacon and a lot of brand names you would recognize. Also, Smithfield supplies a lot of restaurant chains namely Arby's with their ham. (not that the restaurants are open right now to use the meat but if they were to open it could be a problem).\n\nThis means less food going to the shelves and prices will skyrocket short-term.  Probably won't last forever but we are going to see a squeeze.\n\nCombine this with the fact that China's pig stock was decimated by 75% last year from the African swine flu and they asked United States to ramp up production and anticipate sending them nearly double the exports to help make up for this loss. Now that the American barns are full as fuck the coronavirus happens and we are having no way to get these pigs to China. China has since started importing tens of thousands of pigs and sows from other countries, mainly France. That means if we are able to get transportation open that there may be nowhere for this excess of pigs to go which will be throwing gasoline on the flames.\n\negg producers are in the same boat because restaurants are no longer buying breaker liquid eggs. The turn around on these eggs from chicken to toilet is roughly less than a week. The freezers are already full and Barns are euthanizing hundreds of thousands of birds and those that haven't been killed have had their diet change to reduce and stop are egg-laying processes.  the full of eggs can be effectively stalled out quickly but it cannot be started back up nearly as fast call the price of eggs is going to go to the Moon as well. This means whole egg products, liquid egg products, omelets or other products that use eggs as ingredients are going to see a price increase. (Think McDonald's breakfast and dozen egg packs on the grocery store shelves)\n\nI'm not sure whether to buy puts on the big producers like Tyson or Hormel or if the skyrocketing prices will actually generate excess revenue greater than the lower volume at a lower price would have. I'm not that smart.\n\n\nAlso with oil being so cheap nobody is buying corn because it's not profitable to make ethanol which means there are no ddg's going into the animal feed to begin with. Combine that with a possible reduced animal population (after the cull) and the future of grain isn't looking super good. What's the point of growing it if there's no animals to feed it to or ethanol to make from it? Looking at a possible FAT surplus. \n\nThat means less $ going to the hands of producers which in turn means they're not going to be buying things like expensive genetics seeds or fancy new tractors from companies like John Deere. we Major egg manufacturers stop selling products is kind of hard for them to not lay off work force. The fact that they are all you need will not fare well for these companies as they will have to continue to pay employees to produce nothing. The ripple effect will be felt all the way down the line...\n\nTake this information for what you will as it is not intended to be investing advise.\n\n\nThis will likely be national news shortly, it's already all over the news the major ag producing parts of the country.\n\nNow go get that money. Or at the very least, stock your freezer.\n\n\nAdditional sources:\n\n[Smithfield SD plant lied about covid #s and still had half of the state's cases in one facility](https://theintercept.com/2020/04/19/smithfield-foods-wisconsin-coronavirus/)\n\n[first Tyson closure](https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/prevention-cures/492925-tyson-food-pork-plant-in-iowa-closes-due-to)\n\n[grain futures lower per low oil proces](https://www.reuters.com/article/global-grains-idUSL2N2C32XB)\n\n[chicken producers killing herds among excess eggs vs demand](https://www.agriculture.com/news/business/chicken-company-to-cull-birds-as-processing-capacity-plummets)\n\n[pigs can fly](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-swinefever-pigs-imports/pigs-fly-in-as-china-replenishes-worlds-biggest-hog-herd-idUSKBN21K14T)\n\n[global food supply disrupted](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-food-supplies-insi/coronavirus-upends-global-food-supply-chains-in-latest-economic-shock-idUSKBN21L2V7)\n\n[Next Tyson plant about to go tits up](https://kwwl.com/2020/04/19/iowa-lawmakers-file-osha-complaint-over-working-conditions-at-tyson-plant-in-waterloo/)\n\nEdit: I think I'm looking at buying **puts** on major meat processors and egg processors and expecting them to miss earnings do to missed revenue from plant closures.
