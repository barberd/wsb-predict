But even as those stocks are reaching record highs, I\u2019m still finding uncut gems that are still near their 52 week low prices. \n\nSDC: Smile Direct Club is just as well positioned to win as its counterpart Teladoc. With all the kids and adults stuck at home, the virus lurking outside, and dental facilities canceling elective procedures, surgeries and non-urgent dental visits, how could SDC fail?\n\nBUD: The Beer company is still a smart play as CNBC continues pumping Constellation Brands. BUD\u2019s stock has been forgotten while its beers continues being sold out at my local neighborhood shop. \n\nKHC: While Kellogg, P&G are being serenaded on CNBC, they only started talking about Kraft Foods this week. I don\u2019t know of anyone not stocking up on Mac and cheese during this season. \n\n\n \u201cHe who has ears to hear, let him hear\u201d", "created_utc": 1587313861.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g4aklg/wall_street_forgot_about_these_covid19_stocks_bud/", "is_self": true}
