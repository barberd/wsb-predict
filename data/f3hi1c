For messing up those sweet sweet MSFT tendies, I propose we do the following and I'm goddamn dead serious:\n\n1. Unsub prime membership\n2. Order shit and tell them you didn't receive anything\n3. Hit them with those return orders to get them on that shipping\n4. Order and cancel in 2 hours to waste their warehouse labor\n5. Blow up their email so they can't support other customers that really need help\n6. Send those hate messages via Twitter\n7.
