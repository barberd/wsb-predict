{"id": "g2kw5x", "title": "I'm up $800 on RH this week. Should I quit my job?", "selftext": "I opened a robinhood account recently and was able to enable options trading. I closed my eyes, started pressing random buttons, and accidentally placed some calls. \n\nI have made $800 so far this week. \n\nMy question is this: I'm obviously naturally talented at the stock market. If I had invested $300k instead of $300, I would be a millionaire right now! I can easily take out a loan for that much if my parents cosign (my credit score is kind of low, 620).  I only make $56k/year at my day job. I'm only now, after installing Robinhood and making stacks in mere days, realizing how poor I am. \n\nI masturbated to make sure that I'm thinking clearly, and it still seems like a good idea to quit. I need a solid 8 hours/day free to watch my RH tickers oscillate. \n\nProof:  https://imgur.com/8soaLca \n\nAnyway, if any of you need trading advice, just PM me. next week after my loan clears, I'll probably hire a secretary to keep up with call volume. Might be a good idea to start a stonk consulting business. My mind is spinning with the possibilities!\n\n *Cody & Noel, if you're lurking here and happen to see this, wanted to give a shoutout and tell you that I made my +$665 options trade while listening to Stinky Money. PM me to claim your cut.*", "created_utc": 1587062675.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2kw5x/im_up_800_on_rh_this_week_should_i_quit_my_job/", "is_self": true}
