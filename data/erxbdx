{"id": "erxbdx", "title": "Your thoughts on SRNE", "selftext": "I purchased a couple 3/20 $4 Calls back in December on hopes of good Cart-T results. I made a good chunk of change off of these when a private firm offred to buy at $7 a share and the price hit a high of about $5 a share. But i didn't sell in lew of news on the offer and again Cart-T results. Every morning it gets shorted to hell and back and I am slowly losing gains. What do you guys think? Should I sell and focus my investments elsewhere? or should I hold and see where this takes me?", "created_utc": 1579625392, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/erxbdx/your_thoughts_on_srne/", "is_self": true}
