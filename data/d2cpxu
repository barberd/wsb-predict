Argentinian here, first, sorry for my bad english.\n\nI want to open an account, and currently I only can open TD AMERITRADE or INTERACTIVE BROKERS. Which one do you recommend?\n\nMy second question is if after I open an account here, i can change of brokers for one that doesn't have a lot of trading fees.  \nAnd how can I fund that account if I don't have an US bank account.\n\nThank you so much for your help.", "created_utc": 1568142985, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d2cpxu/brokers_as_a_foreign_investor/", "is_self": true}
