They also denied the crew access to single rooms and told them to get into 2-4 person shared rooms.  Soooo...that's a thing.  \n\nThing is, if this is getting amped and more sites pick it up it'll be huge that another plague ship is headed for Miami and Norwegian doesn't care about causalities.  Might be able to make a play if the story blows up and Monday is the green puts buy day.    5/15 NCLH 14P\n\nCurrent positions: \n\n5/8: F 4p; HOG 19P\n\n5/15: GILD 80P; SQ 60P; \n\n9/18: EEM 19.5P  WHY DO I KEEP THIS THING!?
