{"id": "ecmmxs", "title": "Yolo on NVAX?", "selftext": "They seem to be a 70/30 shot of having good results in their phase 3 flu vaccine trial (results coming Q1 2020). Flu vaccines are $5 billion worldwide and Sanofi was able to get 68% of the market in a few years with a superior product. NVAX has beat them handily on the last two trials. \n\nThe company has a \\~$100 million market cap and a darn good chance to have the best product in a $5 billion market before March. The April 20th, 2020 calls are only about $1.35 (share price around $4)... I like the risk reward here. A positive result for this Nanoflu has to send the stock up over 100%. Seems like the time to YOLO. What do you we think?", "created_utc": 1576722168, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ecmmxs/yolo_on_nvax/", "is_self": true}
