Boogeyman Soros and most polarized social media user Trump with FB in the same title? Add in Bloomberg? FB is going to the moon\n\n- We're expecting EPS to go up regardless, but current estimates are too low. \n- I'd expect share prices to go to 240 after earnings. If it goes to 240 we're looking at a 9.1% price increase over the course of a week (with a best case of 255 - 16% over a week). Buy your calls for 225 or 230 now, this can't go down.", "created_utc": 1579880187, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/etbyxx/fb_to_240_next_week/", "is_self": true}
