Had to settle for the boomer stamps.\n\nI sold after hours near the peak like a fukkin pro. Called top when even Axe from Billions would\u2019ve bitched out early or punted late.\n\nThat was my 4th day trade for the week but my account will be 25k tomorrow so you can say I stuck it to the system.\n\nI will return to my intro to options YouTube playlist now.  I am a winning trader now all-time and will regularly post DD for others to move up as well.", "created_utc": 1589235632.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghxulf/nvax_lottery_plays/", "is_self": true}
