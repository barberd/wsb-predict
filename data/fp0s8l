I\u2019m your host and resident autist u/expander2. You have to be able to read to gain anything from this so that rules out about half of you. As always, this is organized from most important at the top to least important at the bottom. A TLDR, plays, and previous DD summaries will be at the bottom. My last post still stands and holds some good info so check it out for more plays if this isn't enough for you greedy fucks.\n\nDISCLAIMER; I am not personally advocating for any play that I add to this list. I merely go through a couple of days of posts and find what I think is competent DD. PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK.\n\nWe are gonna start this one out with some news I guess. Waffle House has closed 365 locations. If fucking waffle house closes then you know we are absolutely going to get plowed by The Wuflu. Make sure to wear your old panties cause Winnie the Dictator is not gonna wait for you to slide them off, he's gonna rip them from your ass.[ This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fokd6w/waffle_house_closes_365_locations_drill_team_6/) gives some more details about the whole situation. Waffle House says that things are not getting better then that tells us to re-examine whatever the hell is going on out there.\n\nAs a matter of fact, I have a lot of shit that points to the fact that America is fuk. Our[ Autist Investigator\u2122](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fo9cks/did_a_little_dd_on_new_york/) of the day is saying we as a people are dumb, stupid, idiots that only care about ourselves (which is true) and that this is only the beginning. You bulls thought that was[ the bottom](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fogfty/the_good_news_and_bad_news_djia_makes_best_single/) huh? Think again retards. I hope you made some money off of this pump because it sure as hell is not gonna last.[ This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/folqfl/comparison_of_1929_2008_2020_spx/) is a fantastic comparison of the depression, recession, and COVID19 fuckening. This is a very good technical analysis that only like 15 of you will understand, so for everyone else you got juked by the fed so get ready for blood.\n\nThis brings me to my next DD. \"Priced in\" doesn't mean the price WILL NOT CHANGE. It means the market is already anticipating what will happen and is reacting accordingly. My man[ u/Um5acentric](https://www.reddit.com/user/Um5acentric/) wrote a[ great post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fo5tx7/what_priced_in_actually_means/) explaining what \"Priced in\" means and even gave an example so the smooth-brains could understand.\n\nNow to the real DD. I hope you idiots listened to me the other day when I said puts in India because guess what? Here come some tendies. I will repeat myself; Mexico (EWW), Germany (EWG), France (EWQ), India (INDA), and Australia (EWA). These are all decent options. Not Brazil (EWZ) as its already down like 60% or something stupid and not Japan (EWJ) because they seem to have their shit together. Read the DD on my last summary for more info on India and Mexico.\n\nNext Medtronic (MDT). MDT makes ventilators. Ventilators are a hot item at the moment because of Boomer Doomer. Buy calls? If you want but who fucking knows at this point.[ This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fnxxpy/mdt_the_hidden_beer_virus_gem/) gets into it a little more than I can here.\n\n[This guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fohxo4/mtch_717_90110c/) says Match (MTCH) which includes Tinder is going to go up because everyone is horny from the Beer Flu. Our wives/wives' boyfriends/dogs/fingers arent enough so random strangers from an app will have to do. He also explains a bunch of shit about profitability and the like the maybe read it. Could make some money, could not. Such is the nature of WSB.\n\nNow, a little mayo for you tards to eat (that means this will help you).[ This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fopuyx/daddy_where_does_money_come_from_birds_bees_long/) explains how to make money by looking at how companies handle their bond debt and are gonna be able to pay it off. If they cant, short the fuck out of them. If they can pay the debt then find another company dipshit, we can't spoon feed you every play. This is your knowledge of the day so take it in, gargle it a bit then swallow that shit because we don't spit around here.\n\nFinally, a new edition that I'm gonna try and do every time;\n\nBig Stupid Idiot of the Day is[ this dude](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fnws9y/no_school_i_got_your_history_lesson_fucktards/). I have no fucking clue what he's saying but he may have ate too many bath bombs.\n\nGood luck fuckers and tune in on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for more WSB DD Summaries!\n\nTLDR; Buckle in boys cause we are going down more. The next few weeks will be bloody so hold the line and Valhalla awaits. None of you know what \"Priced in\" means, Medtronic and Match look like good options, and playing on companies bond debt seems like a good idea.\n\nPlays; Puts in EWW, EWG, EWQ, INDA, and EWA. Calls in MDT and MTCH.\n\nPrevious WSB DD Summaries;[ 3/21-3/23](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fnui1i/i_compiled_dd_from_the_last_3_days_for_you_cucks/)", "created_utc": 1585179203.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fp0s8l/wsb_dd_summary_324325_plays_and_tldr_included/", "is_self": true}
