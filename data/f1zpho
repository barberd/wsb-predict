The same goes for the beer virus which has so far only infected less than 20k and killed 1k.\n\nYou can't really argue with that since the only place with that big of a population base to infect and get infected was China. But now with the Japanese cruise ship, we have some real data about the level of infections, which seem very high. Bears should do some research and report back.\n\nIn the meantime, MSFT $220 March and QQQ $250 March.
