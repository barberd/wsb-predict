Amazon's profit is from its cloud business, Microsoft's comes from its enterprise services, Apple is consumer driven, Facebook and Google rely on ads.\n\nWho do you think is spending on cloud or enterprise services? Those cratering sectors.\n\nWho do you think is buying $1000 phones? Those people working in the service industry and for the companies in those cratering sectors.\n\nWho do you think is buying ads? Those cratering sectors.\n\nSurprise, surprise, tech is not a self sustaining economy in itself. They don't exist in a bubble outside of the economy.\n\nEDIT: Shit, forgot this: MSFT 200C 4/17, GOOG 2000C 4/17, AMZN 20000C 5/15", "created_utc": 1586839278.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0z13t/drrr_tech_is_the_us_economy_literally_cant_go/", "is_self": true}
