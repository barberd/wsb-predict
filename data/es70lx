{"id": "es70lx", "title": "A noob and TSLA", "selftext": "TL;DR: I bought TSLA with 0 knowledge of the stock market and now memes are making me wonder what I should do with it.\n\nHello, I found a $100 gift card to stockpile that my grandparents got me years ago. On a whim I decided to finally use it and bought Tesla stock on Friday as it's the only company I really follow at all (I'm an aerospace engineer).\n\nI've never bought stock before and know very little about how it works. But today I get on Reddit and see all these posts about TSLA popping up. I tried to make sense of some of the posts, but between acronyms, new terms, and meme talk I couldn't quite decipher what was going on. Again I'm very new.\n\nSo my question is, what exactly happened? And should I do anything to capitalize on it? I know $100 is almost nothing in the stock market, just curious if there's a \"best move\".\n\nThanks guys!", "created_utc": 1579668379, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/es70lx/a_noob_and_tsla/", "is_self": true}
