He told me to kill 2 birds with 1 stone, so he made me break my wsb virgin and took my an@l virgin and thus i become \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b .\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/imzd6ggunyr41.png?width=1364&format=png&auto=webp&s=c89dde8eadf55470c8629bb5c4723a9302c1e25b\n\nThe SPY will most likely move downwards, in the coming days. Many DD has already explained about low volume and peaking bull momentum.\n\nHence, it is now decent play to start your shorts/puts with a stop loss just above the moving average. Bcoz we all know that the bulls are always on top of us, this will just be a retracement and will continue to ride us to new ATH. So don't fight it and accept yourself as bottom and go long after the retracement. It will retrace to either A or B scenario, i dont know, i just guessing with fib numbers as a rough guide.\n\nOR the C scenario can happen.......\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0meppp8vnyr41.png?width=1026&format=png&auto=webp&s=98fef9748d647063f2e0c0afb0866c5995587712\n\nUnder the C scenario, your wife wears her strap on and also take you from the front. But it will all be worth it, bcoz it will end in a big orgasmic spasmz to the bottom. That way you know you are truely \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b .\n\nSo what to do? Start loading some puts, with stop loss above moving average. Do not diamond hands, **DO NOT DIAMOND HANDS**. If stop loss triggered, let go and wait for SPX reach 3000-3100 (C scenario) and be gay again. The only thing is should be diamond is the buttplug you buy yourself after you print.\n\nShort Targets, A: SPX 2650, B: SPX 2470. Confirming A or B scenario would be difficult without looking at the price action at that time, so you gotta move with the bull. Short target for C? Same as A and B and also C stands for cuum.", "created_utc": 1586511598.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fycs23/this_is_what_is_going_to_happen_to_spx_next/", "is_self": true}
