(I Can\u2019t leverage the house because it\u2019s in my wife\u2019s name, we are upside down on it, and she\u2019d find out) \n\nI live in Canada which sucks ass, as i can\u2019t use RH to sort out this problem. (Either win the money I need or lose it all and push me over the tempting edge of death) Thusly I\u2019ve been forced to open a wealth simple trade account. Basically my Personal Risk Tolerance, cannot take the crushing 50k debt load and fear of losing the house is keeping me up at night so I have to do something quick.\n\nI\u2019ve played around, but now I need the best possible worst suggestion stonk bet using wealth simple, that will either pay my debts or help with the final solution. There are no bad suggestions. \n\nThanks.", "created_utc": 1575349529, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e5c1fh/this_is_a_real_shit_post_like_im_gonna_do_it_but/", "is_self": true}
