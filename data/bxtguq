{"id": "bxtguq", "title": "How to Spot Hype in the Wild", "selftext": "BYND has a tiny revenue base in an extremely competitive market with razor thin margins. This will not end well in the long run. However in the short term, this will rocket like the Apollo 11. Some people are asking why BYND and how to identify a similar situation for the future? The answer is three big things to look for: \n\n1) Incredibly Low float- just 11m shares \n\n2) Highly Shorted - 51% short, 160% borrow rate \n\n3) The Hype - more art than science. \n\n**There are a LOT of shitty stocks with low floats and that are highly shorted.** Penny stocks, Chinese Meme stocks, off brand electric car companies, etc. **The difference between those POSs and this POS is hype.** To learn how to spot beautiful hype in the wild, I recommend you read the following introduction from Beyond Meat's conference call. If you can read the following few paragraphs without getting goosebumps or imagining someone in a black turtleneck on a stage explaining how they can transform lead into gold, you are missing the crucial third ingredient in your \"Why isn't my shitty stock rallying like this?\" question. These types of speeches typically only happen at the choicest parts of a bull market- so enjoy it while it lasts. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Given that many of you are new to our story, I want to take a little more time on this first call to provide an overview of our business model and global growth strategy. At Beyond Meat, our focus is squarely on the center of the plate protein, a segment traditionally is seen very little in step change innovation. We began with a simple question, do you need an animal to produce meat? The common understanding of meat is it has to come from a chicken, cow or pig or some other type of animal.\n\nWhen we think about meat, we define it in terms of its composition. And as it turns out, meat is at a high-level, an assembly of amino acids, lipids, trace minerals and vitamins and water. We\u2019ve developed a scientific and technological understanding as well as infrastructure over the past decade to assemble these core parts into the architecture of meat, drawing directly from plant-based sources.\n\nWe understand and use the architecture of meat to present these inputs in a way that to the best of our ability today offers the same satisfying taste, texture, aroma and nutritional benefits as animal-based meats. So instead of running plant materials in the form of feed to an animal to build meat, we are bypassing the animal and using plants to build meat directly.\n\nWe view our work as a progression of advancements, some big, most incremental toward a build of meat from plants is indistinguishable from its animal protein equivalent. Since the first days of the company, we do this in dialogue with the consumer. The voice of the consumer is deeply embedded in our products. We ask our scientists and engineers what can science do, but we ask the consumer what should science do. And here is what they told us. They\u2019ve made it very clear that they don\u2019t want \\[indiscernible\\] in their food, that they don't want artificial ingredients, that they feel they have too much soy and wheat in their diets already, they want familiar and short ingredient list.\n\nIt is this dialogue that led us to trademark the phrase \"eat what you love, because we believe that we are enabling consumers and their families to continue to enjoy and even increase their consumption of burgers and sausage by using our plant-based meats and avoiding some of the concerns they may have around animal derived meats.\"", "created_utc": 1559906786, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bxtguq/how_to_spot_hype_in_the_wild/", "is_self": true}
