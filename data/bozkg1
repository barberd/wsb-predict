Short borrow rate has gone from 22% to 24% to 26% to 37% over the past 4 trading sessions. I have posted about this a few times implied a short squeeze was incoming but the mods apparently deleted my old posts... Thanks for that. For those wondering, there are no shares to short on Fidelity, so this could continue for a while as the borrow rate increases and shorts are forced to cover. Lockup still has 5.5 months to go so these are the only 10m shares that will trade for a while. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApparently all the mods want are spongebob memes and pictures of people losing $400 on Robinhood.", "created_utc": 1557935292, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bozkg1/bynd_short_borrow_rate_now_up_to_37/", "is_self": true}
