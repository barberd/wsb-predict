The sophistication is near zero save for a few of the critters that inhabit this desolate land. It\u2019s incredibly cutthroat and for those that do survive the initial shock still get beaten down by the more senior wildlife.\n\nOur primary groups are split up into three separate but very similar factions: Bear, Bull, and Theta Gang. \n\nBear gang is almost always asleep. When the overall landscape gets a little uncomfortable they awake for a few minutes, only to go back into hybernation for a few more decades. \n\nWhen they do awake, they let out a terrible scream that sounds something like \u201cSPY puts because I\u2019m a filthy commie\u201d or \u201cI have bearish DD on AAPL and MSFT\u201d, but these bears are short lived and typically get slaughtered after awakening,\n\nBull gang, the overly optimistic and always awake. Bull gang herds are much larger than bear gang herds. This is partially due to the fact bulls will typically go with the flow and not overcomplicate life. If the harvest is strong, bull gang is in. Bull gang is simple yet much more successful than bears.\n\nTheta gang. \n\nThe most hated yet most respected gang on this degenerate plane. Unlike the simple bulls and bears, theta gang takes no form. Theta gang exists simply because the universe exists. While the bulls and bears have relatively short lifespans theta gang is eternal. \n\nTheta gang thrives on the minimalist approach. As long as time passes, then theta gang is alive,\n\n\nThe end\n\nI\u2019m drunk\nSent from an iPhone \nGood luck", "created_utc": 1574830782, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e2aywt/wallstreetbets_comprehensive_guide_was_to_the/", "is_self": true}
