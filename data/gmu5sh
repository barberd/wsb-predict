{"id": "gmu5sh", "title": "CANNABIS STOCKS OPPORTUNITY", "selftext": "Canadian Cannabis Industry stocks look like they turned the corner on proving their profitability & viability & are ready to go back up to their full potentials.\n\nAdult Recreational Sales of Cannabis 2.0 have gone up due to hoarding like toilet paper & sales will keep growing during self isolation rules in Canada.\n\nCannabis 2.0 & derivatives are legal in Canada & the government is the biggest distributor & they also retail too. You can buy it online, at a store or get it delivered. They definitely will be expanding Cannabis Sales for taxes for all the Covid19 Aid & Cash they are giving to citizens & businesses.\n\nHere's the Canadian Cannabis Stocks trading on the TSX, USA (NYSE & Nasdaq) & some European exchanges:\n\nAurora Cannabis Inc (ACB), Cronos Group Inc (CRON), HEXO Corp (HEXO), OrganiGram Holdings Inc. (OGI), Village Farms International, Inc. (VFF), Canopy Growth Corporation (WEED / CGC)\n\nThey all are near their 52 week lows & are Short Squeeze candidates. ACB popped a bit since their last Q3 May 14 ER but there's still lots of room to go up.  HEXO is next on June 11.\n\nPast Big Stock Pick winners that I posted about in the past before their run up:\n\nAMD, ATVI, FB, LOGI, LULU, PYPL, TSLA, TWTR\n\nGood luck & always do your Due Diligence before investing.\n\nEDIT Added from comments:\n\nAPHA is like TLRY. They will do well to but right now I think the Canadian TSX listed & headquartered ones have the advantage in Canada due to the government bailouts & legalized & \"essential\" status. If the USA legalizes, then even more BOOM for APHA & TLRY!", "created_utc": 1589912682.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gmu5sh/cannabis_stocks_opportunity/", "is_self": true}
