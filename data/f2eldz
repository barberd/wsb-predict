{"id": "f2eldz", "title": "The honest truth about $SPCE", "selftext": "Here\u2019s the thing... 90% of us meming about Virgin Galactic would much rather have money in Starlink/SpaceX or even Blue Origin. However, despite rumors of those guys going public, they\u2019re still private. So we are left with $SPCE.\n\nBy 2040 the space industry will have massively expanded. We are on the brink of never seen before artificial constellations bringing a new age to satellite communications. We have a man who revolutionized the EV industry dedicating his life to landing humans on Mars. Some of the greatest minds and most well funded companies on the planet are all working on space related tech. If you think we aren\u2019t at the beginning of something huge, you\u2019re naive.\n\nSure, I want to make a quick buck just as much as my fellow retards, but if you think the $SPCE hype we\u2019re seeing right now is as far as it will go, you\u2019re going to miss out on a brand new dynasty of tendies. I\u2019ve interned at some of the unicorns in the Valley over the last few years and witnessed some of the brightest young minds grind day and night to get a shot at working at companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin.\n\nLook at how fucking far we\u2019ve come from 100 years ago. Hell, look at 10 years ago and then tell me to my face you don\u2019t think space is the future. The bottom line is for us autists with only a Robinhood app and a dream, Virgin Galactic is our best entry into the space industry... and the sooner you get into that industry, the better.", "created_utc": 1581453558, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f2eldz/the_honest_truth_about_spce/", "is_self": true}
