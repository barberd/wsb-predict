Lawyers wanted more money and $MNK cannot pay it. Once the lawyers realized the company will bankrupt they immediately took the cash offer they denied initially. MNK has settled globally. This will repeat itself for all generic drug makers. All of these companies are highly leveraged and are sitting on piles of debt. They do not have the cash to pay the amount the lawyers want. TEVA will settle with the suboxone donation offer and minimal cash. Company produces great revenues despite leverage and with new growing products the company is destined for a turnaround. It has been continuously beat down and people seem to forget TEVA's global generic dominance. The companies global manufacturing presence is unmatched. First to get FDA approval on almost 95% of incoming generics. If the smaller generic companies shut down that will only benefit TEVA as it will have price control in a generics market. \n\n Yesterday's MNK news: [https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/02/24/mallinckrodt-considers-bankruptcy-over-opioid-laws.aspx](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/02/24/mallinckrodt-considers-bankruptcy-over-opioid-laws.aspx) \n\nToday's settlement news:  [https://www.barrons.com/articles/mallinckrodt-stock-opioid-lawsuits-settlement-bankruptcy-subsidiaries-generic-drugs-oxycodone-51582638833](https://www.barrons.com/articles/mallinckrodt-stock-opioid-lawsuits-settlement-bankruptcy-subsidiaries-generic-drugs-oxycodone-51582638833) \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/4m0060wl23j41.gif", "created_utc": 1582642979, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9biq9/long_generic_drug_makers_teva_mnk_myl_etc_dd/", "is_self": true}
