{"id": "dxbqrt", "title": "The Complete Streaming Wars Synopsis.", "selftext": "Welcome autists, gather round as I tell the tale of the most misunderstood conflict in modern media.\n\nWhile Disney+ has been creating a lot of noise and sparking momentum for Disney stock, the streaming wars as it stands now, is being misunderstood by the vast majority of you. This post is in an effort to save you from losing money in the streaming services industry, so that you may lose it more autistically in Semiconductors and microchips.  Before we get into it, lets take a look at who the players are in the space. As a forward, I do not have positions in any companies mentioned as this is not my area of expertise. You may be asking, why are you posing if you don't know the streaming services space? Well, because its WSBs, and apparently none of you understand it either cause I haven't seen any real DD on it. I have posted current company cash balances for each one mentioned as this is an incredibly cash intensive business (excluding Roku perhaps)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**NFLX**\n\nNet Cash *Deficit*: - 8 Billion\n\nNetflix is a giant in the streaming industry, but trades at an extremely high multiple of \\~93x P/E currently. Its biggest strengths are its experience in streaming services, it\u2019s already developed customer base, it\u2019s investments and developments into streaming specific infrastructure and most importantly, it\u2019s development of home-grown content in foreign countries. Netflix and other streaming services are competing for very different customer bases outside of the US, in that it is one of the only streaming services that develops content for its local user base whether that be US based, In India, or somewhere in the EU. As emerging markets continue to grow Netflix is best poised to produce original content that is geographically/culturally specific and relevant. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**AAPL**\n\nNet Cash Balance: 98 Billion\n\nApple is a relatively new contender in the streaming space. Its biggest strength is its overwhelmingly healthy balance sheet, and its devoted user base of apple services and products. Apple will be best suited to pay practically any price it chooses to develop content or acquire it from third parties. Apple products and services are also widespread in many parts of eastern Asia and are gaining traction throughout other markets. Much remains \u201cUp in the air\u201d so to speak as far as what will be Apples final product in the streaming space. While most of the companies current value comes from Iphone sales at about 42%, future forecasts show that services including streaming is a must to maintain Apples growth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**AMZN**\n\nNet cash balance: 18 Billion\n\nAmazon has continually struggled to develop their streaming services and as such has begun to shift it\u2019s attention into many other parts of its core business. Amazons web services is by far the most critical part of its business followed secondly by its consumer discretionary / retail space. Amazon is not well positioned to continue the dragging battle that is the streaming wars as it simply doesn\u2019t represent any significant revenue income. Although this may sound similar to Apple, at least Apple plans on developing their streaming services to reach a large portion of their revenue as Iphone sales continue to contract, where as amazon has a lack luster plan to develop its current streaming platforms. Simply put, Amazons could flat out stop streaming services entirely and the company  (and consumers IMO) wouldn't even notice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**DIS**\n\nNet Cash *Deficit*: 44 Billion\n\nDisney has been a streaming service in a sense for a long time, so it is somewhat puzzling to me that they haven\u2019t developed a direct to consumer streaming platform already. Overall Cable and its place in the world is quickly fading, even in developing and emerging markets as is generally far more cost efficient to stream rather than cable for consumers. It is for this reason that Disney is forced to cannibalize its own revenues in from cable rights in order to offer streaming now. Overtime, this means a much lesser improvement to balance sheet performance as their new Disney+ streaming service is essentially their replacement / solution to the upcoming losses from the disappearance of cable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ROKU**\n\nNet cash Balance: 388 Million\n\nRoku is an add supported business and the ultimate winner in the streaming space. As more and more streaming platforms and content offerings become available, Rokus value becomes more and more apparent to consumers. Rokus biggest hurdles are its current unprofitability, and its lacking cash balance, which it needs to continue development.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSummary (All highly opinionated of course):\n\nDisney+ may be the stellar service that investors believe it is, but its success is needed, not optional, thus making Disney far less appetizing. Additionally, its user base will be almost exclusively US based which is by far the most crowded streaming space. Most of the growth in streaming services across the board comes from emerging markets and foreign market penetration. Disney opening its own streaming platform is a must to maintain the company\u2019s relevance. Additionally, Netflix, although incredibly overvalued will ultimately be the only company to continually develop user growth in emerging markets apart from locally grown services, the only exception to this may be Apple. Apple may be able to develop outside of US markets in areas where they have high user counts, unfortunately, these markets are also being subject to quite a bit of economic uncertainty and external forces. Finally, Roku is the only clear cut and dry winner in this space. Roku is pioneering the field it\u2019s currently in. Roku is much like the shovel salesman at the entrance to the gold mine, the only difference is, each time the gold mine entrance moves farther west Roku has already paved the road to beat the miners to it.  \n \n\nIn any case, the overvaluation of Disney will be corrected and Roku will continue to grow its path to profitability as more and more streaming services are offered. Disney plus, Apple TV and many others are not a \u201cNetflix\u201d killer given the different consumer bases and objectives of the companies and Amazon will most likely begin to quietly back out of the streaming space over the years, not grow their stake in it.\n\nThank you for coming to my TED Talk, I will now be taking questions from the audience.", "created_utc": 1573934152, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dxbqrt/the_complete_streaming_wars_synopsis/", "is_self": true}
