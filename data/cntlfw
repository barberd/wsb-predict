Maybe it\u2019s stock (long and short), maybe it\u2019s options, or maybe futures, but this shit has to be planned.", "selftext": "Picture an old man in pajamas, with the vice of his choice - probably a fine whiskey or cigar, but maybe a joint or a line of cocaine - on the table in front of him.\n\nHe's got Bloomberg muted with subtitles on a little TV but the big TV is playing a movie from the late 2000s. He's far beyond being far beyond rich enough to have more than one screen in his home office, they're probably both computer monitors but he's old and when he's using them as TVs that's what they are to him. He'd be in the lounge but his wife is in there drunkenly gossiping with a couple of the maids. \n\nTwo hours ago, before starting the movie, he glanced at a clock by force of habit and noticed it was about time for futures to open. The last thing he did before starting the movie is double-check the futures sell orders on his brokerage and last-minute double check his research from the day, making sure no big news has released since earlier. The market is crashing and he's satisfied with the price and volume choices on his sell orders - not that it takes much confidence to satisfy him, he doesn't care if he has a loss day, trying to mitigate risk is more like a form of etiquette than a real concern for him. He didn't care to keep watching the crash, stress is the antithesis of his purpose in life, so it's only on the back of his mind now and he's not worrying about what's happening with his orders or what's developing to happen tomorrow - he's just slightly curious how long the dip will last. \n\nHis cell phone rings. It's a buddy he met playing golf a few years ago. There's background noise of other people, but it's hard to tell whether he's at a party or his Wall Street office, busy with the crash. He says there are big moves for tomorrow that need participation, his market maker acquaintance told him there are indicators for low volume tomorrow, so a bunch of market makers are taking the opportunity of the weak resistance and starting a big futures buy to try to push the market into a green trading day and bring in more volume. He says \"you've got to get in on this, start buying futures now and don't sell until tomorrow night.\"\n\nSlightly excited, remembering past gains he got because of phone calls from this guy, and proud of himself for being part of this ivy league \"in group\" of market controllers with golf friends who have them on the list for these phone calls, he immediately cancels all his futures sell orders and submits some buy orders. He looks at charts and says he sees what his golf buddy is talking about, it looks like it is starting a climb, and so he'll keep an eye on it for the rest of the night. People on Wall Street Bets are posting their bearish or bullish predictions, \"watch this spike get red dildoed within 10 minutes\" or \"we'll recover fully by midnight.\" No matter which side is winning, someone is saying \"don't worry about it, futures traders are usually drunk, market could open the exact opposite way.\" \n\nHis movie is paused for the next 55 minutes while he watches futures rise and listens to reactions on Bloomberg. By the time he resumes his movie, YouTube live chats are exploding with bull vs bear arguments and offices full of tryhards in China are having a hectic morning, phones ringing and papers flying everywhere while speculation and possible next moves are yelled in choppy, punchy Mandarin, translating to \"why the fuck are their futures going up?? fucking Americans man goddamn it\"\n\nI made all of this up.", "created_utc": 1565305467, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cntlfw/these_motherfuckers_are_swing_trading_the_market/", "is_self": true}
