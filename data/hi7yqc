Any ideas?  I traded RAD this morning after the run-up, but had I seen the analyst upgrade before, I would have caught it earlier. It would really help to have an alert either on my phone or computer whenever there's an upgrade for a stock with some criteria like daily volume, etc. Does anyone have any ideas other than just to read the news in the morning before/during pre-market?", "created_utc": 1593462303.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hi7yqc/how_do_i_make_a_live_alert_to_notify_me_of_any/", "is_self": true}
