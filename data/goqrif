{"id": "goqrif", "title": "When to short Zoom (NYSE: ZM)", "selftext": "Wondering what everyone's opinions are on slowly building up puts on zm over the next 1-2 months. Although I hope the general macro catalyst for zoom will largely vanish (i.e. lockdowns) over the course of the year, I'm wondering if people think that over time as more companies aim to encourage WFH that such software will be able to support something close to its current valuation. That being said, ZM definitely faces significant competition in both the casual and enterprise space with platforms like Teams being much better integrated with other enterprise tools (Office, OneDrive, etc.) as well as simply being more powerful. \n\nGiven what its trading around now (170 level) I think it may be the case that we've established a top for zoom. However, that could easily change. Thoughts?", "created_utc": 1590178055.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/goqrif/when_to_short_zoom_nyse_zm/", "is_self": true}
