{"id": "eqlb49", "title": "Invasion of Detroit Organization Megathread", "selftext": "**Alright so we have 3 main objectives here:**\n\n1. Establish A Tax Haven in Detroit\n2. Make Tendies when the Cheap real estate goes up as we buy it\n3. Run the City?\n\nAlright, so let's start with the first one.\n\nElections for local officials are in November, so we must get registered there before then. Detroit has around  479,267  registered voters. Meaning it only takes just above half that to infiltrate the city offices. If we abuse the gerrymandered counties we could do it with even less. Now let's look at offices, we can ignore all senate and house positions which leaves us with the Mayor, Attorney General, and Secretary of State. Once we hold these positions we expand programs helping us and boosting investment from outside who in turn ensure our re-election.\n\nNext, we have to buy cheap real estate.\n\n   As another user pointed out we can buy real estate at  [https://buildingdetroit.org/](https://buildingdetroit.org/) . But as others pointed out people could move in an cause many liabilities. To circumvent this we must become the ruling gang. If all of us arm then we can become the main gang running the city from the government from the offices and streets. Via transferring all your assets to a hospitality company whose sole customer is you we can qualify for property tax exemption as seen here.

This surge in investment, as well as the renovations for even more tax exemptions prices for real estate, will go up as long as enough of us do it.\n\nFinally, We will have taken over Detroit we now have to figure out what to do here. Any suggestions? Also because several things I mentioned are illegal I would like to tell the SEC, FBI, NSA, that all of this is an exaggerated theoretical joke and I am not responsible for the actions of those who cannot differentiate a joke from reality.", "created_utc": 1579376932, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eqlb49/invasion_of_detroit_organization_megathread/", "is_self": true}
