This is pointing towards a massive rally that will break through the previous 217 resistance level.\n\nTargeting QQQ to hit 220-224 over the next 1-3 trading sessions. Sentiments remain quite oversold and we have yet to hit the 61% retracement level of the drop.\n\nLong term bearish, but I would avoid puts due to the high VIX. It is better to enter into short positions over the coming 1-2 weeks at a higher level aleast until VIX drops closer to 20.", "created_utc": 1583437015.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fe0o6h/technical_update_qqq_is_in_massive_falling_wedge/", "is_self": true}
