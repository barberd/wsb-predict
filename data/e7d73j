I could easily get a taxi within 3 minutes most times and travel was cheap. \n\nOver the last month all the uber drivers have disappeared. It can take 10 minutes just to connect to a driver and everyone seems to be experiencing it. \n\nWord on the street is Uber May be trying to push drivers on to an hourly rate instead of fee per journey and they\u2019ve all fucked off in my city. \n\nI\u2019d ask an Uber driver but yesterday I had to walk to a taxi tank and queue 15 min for a taxi instead because so many people couldn\u2019t get taxis. \n\nThis is in the U.K., but perhaps a sign of what\u2019s to come.", "created_utc": 1575717364, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e7d73j/uber_dd/", "is_self": true}
