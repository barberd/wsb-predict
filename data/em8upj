Based on current valuations at $490, Tesla would need to be delivering 1,300,000 cars within the next 5 years. In my models, stock is fairly valued at +/- 280 but with **an initial target of 360**.\n\nOn technical side at the top here in the diagram: [$TSLA Overheating?](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/TSLA/0rHRjhME-TSLA-Overheating/) you will notice exhaustion as predicted deliveries enter into \"overpromised\" territory. Of course the usual crowd will defend with China plant opening and unicorns expected. Based on current expectations, TSLA will need to deliver almost 475k cars this year and with demand starting to cough via late cycle fears this is looking doubtful to say the least.\n\n\ud83d\udccc **Flow wise, actively selling 490 overshoots with initial targets at 360 followed by 280 extensions. While to the topside, invalidation and reassessment necessary at 525.** \n\n=&gt; Tracking closely delivery numbers for 2020 but with the boat fully loaded on one side and short interest as a percentage of float still below 20% it is a screaming sell.\n\nGood luck all those on the sell-side in TSLA over the coming sessions.", "created_utc": 1578572267, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/em8upj/tsla_overheating_smells_like_it/", "is_self": true}
