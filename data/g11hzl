{"id": "g11hzl", "title": "SEDG DD", "selftext": "The hotly debated topic between SolarEdge and Enphase technology. Basically, SolarEdge \u201cmanufactures\u201d inverters and Enphase \u201cmanufactures\u201d microinverters. The difference is the location of where the DC is converted to AC. SolarEdge converts DC/AC at a single point, while Enphase converts DC/AC at the solar panel module.\n\nNow why did I quote manufactures? Neither manufactures anything. They outsource the work. SolarEdge outsources to two manufacturers, Jabil (US) and Flex (Singapore). Enphase outsources to only Flex. This means that SolarEdge has better spread the risk of suppliers, while Enphase is fully dependent on Flex.\n\nThe US makes up 70\\~85% of Enphase revenue, while the US is only 50% for  SolarEdge, the remaining 50% coming from Europe (Spread out regional income). SolarEdge also has 60% market share in US residential solar installations in 2019, while Enphase only has 20%.\n\nLastly, SolarEdge is better positioned to replace all the traditional string inverters. Currently, the solar industry is dominated by traditional string inverters (like christmas tree lights, if one goes down, everything goes down). SolarEdge and Enphase created a system where this does not happen. I think that SolarEdge has an edge in replacing the traditional string inverters because it sells inverters that you can just switch out, unlike Enphase which makes microinverters that goes underneath each panel.\n\nTLDR: It's not that long but if you can't read... might as well\u2026.
