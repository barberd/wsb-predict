{"id": "gbsrhz", "title": "Fallout $610p: Elon's Tweet", "selftext": "**Synopsis**. This post explains why Elon's tweet today may result in SEC action and will result in stockholder lawsuits. I invite you, dear reader, to decide whether these impending lawsuits and the Tesla board's fiduciary duties to its shareholders will result it Elon's ouster and/or $TSLA cratering into oblivion. This post is not legal or investment advice, and I have no idea what I'm talking about. \n\n**SeC AcTioN**. Under Rule 10b-5 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the SEC will come and take your tendies and call you a bad man if you \"make any untrue statement of a material fact or...omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made...not misleading...in connection with the purchase or sale of any security,\" assuming you knew or were reckless in not knowing that your statement (or lack thereof) was wrongful.\n\n*2018 Tweets: Here Come the Feds*\n\nOn August 7, 2018, Elon tweeted, \"Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.\" After this infamous tweet, $TSLA rose by more than 6% and closed up almost 11% from the previous day. About six weeks later, the SEC filed a complaint alleging, in part, that Elon's statement was \"false and misleading.\" Further, the SEC alleged that \"\\[o\\]ver the next three hours, Musk made a series of additional materially false and misleading statements via Twitter including: \n\n* 'My hope is \\*all\\* current investors remain with Tesla even if we're private. Would create special purpose fund enabling anyone to stay with Tesla.'\n* 'Shareholders could either to \\[sic\\] sell at 420 or hold shares & go private.'\n* 'Investor support is confirmed. Only reason why this is not certain is that it's contingent on a shareholder vote.'\"\n\nThe SEC asserted that \"Musk knew or was reckless in not knowing that each of these statements was false and/or misleading because he did not have an adequate basis in fact for his assertions,\" explaining that Elon had not in fact secured funding and had not confirmed support of Tesla's investors. These false and misleading statements, the SEC argued, \"caused significant confusion and disruption in the market for Tesla's stock and resulting harm to investors,\" and constituted a violation of Rule 10b-5. \n\nAs you well know, Elon and the Federales settled their spat. Elon stepped down as the chairman of Tesla's board, paid a $20 million penalty, and agreed to \"comply with all mandatory procedures implemented by Tesla, Inc. regarding (i) the oversight of communications relating to the Company made in any format, including, but not limited to, posts on social media (e.g., Twitter), \\[Tesla's\\] website (e.g., \\[Tesla's\\] blog), press releases, and investor calls, and (ii) the pre-approval of any such written communications that contain, or reasonably could contain, information material to \\[Tesla\\] or its shareholders....\" All was gravy, and Elon went back to his choccy milk and tendies...for a while. \n\n*2019 Tweet: Here Come the Feds*\n\nNot one to kowtow to federal enforcement agencies or courts, Elon fired off another tweet on February 19, 2019, contravening Tesla's official production guidance. Specifically, Tesla issued guidance estimating that it would deliver between 360k and 400k total cars in 2019, and Elon tweeted that Tesla \"will make around 500k in 2019.\" To his lawyer's credit, he backtracked quickly, but it was too late: the Federales saddled up and dragged him back into court. In April of 2019, Elon and the SEC amended their settlement agreement to impose more specific restrictions on Elon's greasy fingers. After April 30, 2019, Elon would need Tesla's securities lawyer to pre-approve any public, written communication containing information about Tesla's financial condition, statements, or results, including earnings or guidance, potential or proposed transactions, actual or estimated production numbers, and a bunch of other shit, including any topic that Tesla believed needs pre-approval. All was gravy, and Elon went back to his choccy milk and tendies...for a while. \n\n*2020 Tweet: Here Come the Feds?*\n\nToday, May 1, 2020, Elon fired off another tweet that has drawn the ire of Tesla option holders, shareholders, and, no doubt, board members: \"Tesla stock price is too high imo.\" Do you see the difference between this tweet and the tweets discussed above? This tweet does not contain information, or at least that's what Elon and his lawyers will say if the SEC comes knocking. In particular, they will argue that this statement does not defraud investors and is not \"an untrue statement of material fact.\" Rather, this is a statement of opinion. In fact, this might be the first (but surely not the last) instance where the caveat \"imo\" saves the writer from federal prosecution. This defense may or may not work, and if it doesn't, the $TSLAQ trolls will sob that the plutocracy has impunity and corporate America is a house of cards glued together with the blood of Labor.\n\nIn light of Elon's history flouting the SEC's authority, the SEC may well pursue action for Elon's tweet, but their case would be  thinner than it was in 2018 and 2019. Not to fear, $TSLAQ: the dump is not over.\n\n**Here Come the Stockholders**. Tesla is a Delaware corporation subject to Delaware law, and Elon is its Chief Executive Officer. As you know, until 2009, it was unclear whether corporate officers of Delaware corporations had the same fiduciary duties as corporate directors. In 2009, however, the Delaware Supreme Court held that officers' fiduciary duties to a corporation and its stockholders are identical to directors' fiduciary duties. In fact, corporate officers may have more duties and be less protected from breach of those duties than directors. \n\nAt a minimum, corporate officers owe their corporation and its stockholders duties of loyalty and good care. For example, directors and officers have an \"affirmative duty to protect the interests of the corporation, but also an obligation to refrain from conduct which would injure the corporation and its stockholders or deprive them of profit or advantage.\" Under common law agency principles, a corporate officer may also be considered an agent of its corporation (acting through the board), and thus have a duty of obedience. Do you think Elon's tweet today showed loyalty to Tesla and its stockholders? \n\nUnder Tesla's bylaws, last amended on February 1, 2017, Tesla's CEO serves \"at the discretion of the board of directors.\" The CEO has, \"subject to the supervision, direction and control of the board of directors, ultimate authority for decisions relating to the supervision, direction and management of the affairs and the business of the corporation customarily and usually associated with the position of CEO....\" However, any officer, including the CEO, can be removed, either with or without cause, by vote of the  majority of the board. It's unclear what the board might consider to be \"cause\" for removal, but Tesla's indemnification obligations to its officers provide some insight. Under its bylaws, Tesla will indemnify its officers, to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law, for third party actions and actions by or in the right of Tesla, as long as the officer \"acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of \\[Tesla\\].\" When Elon fired off his tweet today, do you think he reasonably believed it was in the best interests or not opposed to the best interests of Tesla? \n\nEven if the board wants to give Elon a pass, they will be under fire from actual investors (not you) whose interests were harmed by his tweet, opinion or not. Investors who lost big today (think pensions and hedge funds) are angry and have counsel. They will want Elon or Tesla to make them whole, and they will want to make sure this doesn't happen again. Because of his history flouting the SEC and federal court orders, Elon (and Tesla, if they stand behind him) will find courts unsympathetic to his cause. \n\n**TL;DR**: for his tweet today, Elon and Tesla will face lawsuits from stockholders and maybe the SEC. The board of Tesla will be under fire for not acting in the wake of his previous conduct. Heads will roll, and Elon's role at Tesla will change. \n\n**MY POSITION**: 5/8 TSLA $610p", "created_utc": 1588375158.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gbsrhz/fallout_610p_elons_tweet/", "is_self": true}
