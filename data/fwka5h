{"id": "fwka5h", "title": "Shorting Short Squeezes and Relief Rallies", "selftext": "I\u2019ve had solid returns shorting APRN and TLRY on their last big pops. Now adding Wayfair (W) to the list. Avoiding puts for now and shorting outright due to IV (put spread if you want more juice, but I\u2019m just going with underlying). \n\nW claims their revenues jumped 20% in February and March as online shopping ramped up as folks began to work from home. Take a quick look at their site, they ran promotions and sales through this entire period so each sale is margin negative. The company managed to secure a new debt facility priced at 2.5% and convertible at $72.5. Products and furniture of any size purchased can be easily returned. Coupled with the abysmal economic outlook, consumer discretionary spend is tilted south. \n\nTheir model is not sustainable and I expect the gap from $50 to $69 to close. I didn\u2019t even mention Amazon. But I\u2019ll let your imagination run on that one.\n\nEdit: just thought about another way to view this, W sales benefited from covid-19. The entire globe is battling this virus, so inherently the world efforts are a net negative against Wayfair\u2019s temporary strength.", "created_utc": 1586265178.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fwka5h/shorting_short_squeezes_and_relief_rallies/", "is_self": true}
