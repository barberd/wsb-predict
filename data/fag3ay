So I decided to do some research and check what ETF's are included in $EWY.\n\n[https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/products/239681/?referrer=tickerSearch#/](https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/products/239681/?referrer=tickerSearch#/)  \n\n\nTheir top 10 stocks have taken huge hits since Monday including Samsung ,Hynix ,Hyundai and many more.   \n\n\nDESPITE all this EWY is still going up. \n\nConclusion : $EWY should tank either Monday or Tuesday once they report more cases over the weekend. I am holding my 3/6 53p's. Diamond hand boys.", "created_utc": 1582826683, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fag3ay/weird_shit_going_on_with_ewy/", "is_self": true}
