{"id": "e6u8p3", "title": "Verdict on Terracycle public offering?", "selftext": "Here is their public offering of priority stock:\nhttps://terracycle.capital2market.com/terracycle/\n\nI've read there is quiet some upside in the trash/waste mgmt and recycling industry. Seeing as China isn't taking our trash it seems like a good idea to invest in this type of R&amp;D domestically. \n\nThat said I am a little skeptical. Partly because the CEO seems a little too young, and I don't really hear about any of their recycled products in the marketplace even though they have been in business for 15 years. Part of me thinks it's always going to remain a niche greenwashing style company. \n\nI'm a noob so someone else read this offering and tell me what they think of this offering as a long-term investment over 3-4 years.", "created_utc": 1575609899, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e6u8p3/verdict_on_terracycle_public_offering/", "is_self": true}
