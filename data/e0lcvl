Typically if you see someone extremely bearish on a stock 10 times out of 10 unless if they're autistic fools, they have legitimate DD reasons of why a company should be going underwater, but because of reasons unknown they typically get s***-faced when good news about something random happens. Mainly known for shorting stocks and putting hella Put options or credit spreads, these guys look for any opportunity to s*** in the face of Bulls.\n\nBulls - These degenerates are more of the whimsical bunch, running around shooting Call options everywhere and bringing a sense of fatal optimism within the stock market. 8 times out of 10 if you see somebody throwing hella call options in a stock that normally means either something is about to go horribly, horribly wrong, or they're about to make hella good tendies. Like in the Bears, Bulls look for every opportunity to brag about how Bears have no idea what they're talking about, how that \"Stonks only go up.\"\n\nTheta Gang - Finally, &amp; possibly the most intellectual bunch of the degenerates, we have Theta gang. Theta gang are group of individuals who love selling stock options to optimistic Bulls and or Bears who love to buy options that are OTM. Typically you can picture them laughing maniacally when an option eventually reaches expiration and they get their sweet premium tendies from the crying Bull/Bear gang. Theta gang rarely loses money, but if they do, it doesn't really affect them much because another autistic degenerate is going to fall for their trap anyways. If you're actually about who runs the stock market, the answer is \u03b8-Gang.", "created_utc": 1574531717, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e0lcvl/gang_lyfe_\u03b8/", "is_self": true}
