Calls on MRK $85 5/1. \n\n  \n[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\\_id=3580524&fbclid=IwAR0xkqm6gByCKtYC4tXoTxgmzORatg5JllN1zygTmkCzqksJswkcOGg\\_4RE](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3580524&fbclid=IwAR0xkqm6gByCKtYC4tXoTxgmzORatg5JllN1zygTmkCzqksJswkcOGg_4RE)\n\n\"Results: The cohort (including 704 ivermectin treated and 704 controls) was derived from 169 hospitals across 3 continents with COVID-19 illness. The patients were matched for age, sex, race or ethnicity, comorbidities and an illness severity score (qSOFA). Of those requiring mechanical ventilation fewer patients died in the ivermectin group (7.3% versus 21.3%) and overall death rates were lower with ivermectin (1.4% versus 8.5%; HR 0.20 CI 95% 0.11-0.37, p<0.0001).\"\n\n\\----------------------------\n\nI'd say that a 1400-patient, controlled study is wayyyy more legit than that anecdotal shit that pumped GILD.  The paper was published three days ago and I cant find shit about it on the news or google searches.\n\nIvermectin is an FDA-approved antiviral and antiparasitic, that was made years ago by Merck. Merck still sells the name brand in Canada. It's used around the devloping world for worms and other parasitic diseases. However in the US, Ivermectin is primarily used as a lice treatment for kids and as heartworm prophylaxis in dogs (Heartgard). I may have some biases here, but I believe that this isn't being pumped by the media and Big Pharma as a treatment, **since it is a cheap, generic drug.** Disclaimer, the FDA has come out and said that people should not take Heartgard meat-flavored dog pills for COVID. (PLEASE DONT TAKE HEARTGARD, FAM.) But, I do think if people knew about this study it would have to be seriously considered. \n\nThis drug has done work in humans for years in the developing world, check out the wikipedia on it if you want a quick summary. I'd say it's worth a shot. I'm only a medical student for what that's worth.", "created_utc": 1587671312.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6thtl/a_drug_study_with_actual_evidence_of_treatment/", "is_self": true}
