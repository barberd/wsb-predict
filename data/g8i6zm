{"id": "g8i6zm", "title": "Weekly Theta Gang Thread", "selftext": "Another perfect week to be theta gang. The market seems to have come to a stand still in anticipation to next weeks earnings reports. I am anticipating and praying for a large move in one direction depending on how the big guys report. It would be great if the market would gap down so volatility can stay high. \n\nThis week I am like a kid in a candy shop, unsure what to spend my money on. I\u2019ll probably do a lot of day trading so I can minimize risk. Let me know what options you\u2019re writing for one of the biggest weeks of the year. \n\nProof from last week, every one of these expired worthless making the profit around $6500 (went a little wild with the margin): https://i.imgur.com/H7uHSlR.png https://i.imgur.com/kIS9Jf5.png \n\nP.S. Go ahead and ban the dumbass that thought volatility would hit record highs by the end of the April. In no way, shape or form are we going to see levels that high again unless the virus mutates or WW3 starts.", "created_utc": 1587921364.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g8i6zm/weekly_theta_gang_thread/", "is_self": true}
