{"id": "hjwods", "title": "thank you WSB, one last request post", "selftext": " \n\nFrom MS:\n\nthis great community of autists has once again helped me in my time of need. the last thing i need to restore my old youtube channel (with all the finance videos) is the former CHANNEL ID or CHANNEL NAME. perhaps the old URL would help. any of you web ninjas who can help find these items will receive a million shkrelibucks (not actually worth anything).\n\nin exchange i will mention that i am still attracted to REGN, which if you recall was one of my favorite ideas before 'hillaryhairgate' (IT. WAS. JUST. A. JOKE.) The concept then was Dupixent is likely to be one of the biggest drugs of all time and Eylea will be safe from competition (mostly long-acting VEGF competition). 3 years later, this has proven accurate. Dupixent is doing great and Eylea has only grown larger. The competitive threat now for Eylea is gene therapy, which won't be here for a long time and may be constrained in some ways. Meanwhile, I don't expect REGN to stay out of GT forever. But the realistic threats to Eylea are more or less dead or not significant (NVS, KOD, ROG). The share price has advanced meaningfully in response to the above, so what am I thinking that is nonconsensus? I actually think REGN has a great early stage pipeline that will begin to be revealed later this year with first-in-human oncology assets, specifically. I think you get those as a freeish call option, where if they are able to tame CD28, they have a variety of neat abs that have a shot (admittedly not a great one) at opening up a new field for oncology. There was a recent paper on this. I think $1,000 is the price target here, with a sort of blended scenario of some chance of that happening and decent upside without it. Say $900 without it and $1200 with it.\n\nIf we can get my channel reactivated, I will post a stock idea a little sexier than the large-cap REGN! And what the hell, I'll give you an idea every month. Need my old vids. All my precious likes are there. Inactive channel = inactive self-esteem.\n\nPS:. Also please do not refer to me as a convicted felon. I am a justice-experienced individual.", "created_utc": 1593695247.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hjwods/thank_you_wsb_one_last_request_post/", "is_self": true}
