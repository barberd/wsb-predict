She feels similarly confident going into earnings this week. Reasons why I agree:\n\n1) She sent me this pic, unprompted, a couple weeks ago: https://imgur.com/gallery/azaaGJJ\n\n2) Her friends, all firmly middle-class nurses, were over our house Saturday and my wife remarked on a sweater one friend was wearing, and said friend said she got it at TJ Maxx. Becky is a maxxanista. \n\n3) TJ Maxx doesn\u2019t care about beer virus. Their stock is from 2 seasons ago.\n\n4) No one wears expensive clothes anymore. If you\u2019re wearing a suit with a pocket square, French cuffed dress shirt, Italian loafers, and a tie bar, you look like a douche. \n\nTL;DR Long TJX, don\u2019t short them, for their great deals on short skirts and long jackets. \n\nP.S. my ex wife is still a mod", "created_utc": 1582547953, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f8qmsy/followup_to_heavy_dd_on_tj_maxx_tjx/", "is_self": true}
