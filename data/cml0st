{"id": "cml0st", "title": "I'm going bear on AIG", "selftext": "Basic background - the company has been unprofitable eight out of the last nine quarters. Right after announcing earnings Q1 (profitable by .04%, if you exclude CATs), the stock shot up and hasn't went down much since.\n\nThe people I know who works there are miserable - there's a good reason thelayoff website is buzzing for this company. They seem to be \"profitable\" by laying off people month after month and playing the book so they don't have to report numbers (headcount reduction) to the press. Interestingly, every week they hire another \"Head of ____\" (insert newly made senior position here).\n\nCutting expenses just isn't a long term strategy. Nor have I heard anything that actually suggests they're proving their insurance operations. All I'm hearing is that everyone is absolutely terrified for their jobs, and there's zero direction.\n\nHere's how it works - for insurance companies, you're most profitable in Q1 because of a clean slate, less in Q2, miserable in Q3 because of the catastrophes, and Q4 you're trying to hold your breath for as long as possible, but are fucked as AIG because you consistently under-reserve the book - every year for the past eternity - and regulatory forces it to adjust by year end. Their schedule P says as much (Workers Compension et al)\n\nI'm probably an idiot, but I'm seeing this as the Tesla effect - create prices out of nothing. They are unprofitable, period. It's hilarious that all analysts ratings went from hard sell to hard buy on May 6 - for what? A company that can't showcase a fraction of a percent profit unless they exclude their biggest losses (natural disasters) from their balance sheet as if they don't exist? And who the fuck hires three chief IT officers and two chief actuaries within 9 months? They've been replacing executives every week for the past year, but not all of them make the news.\n\nWhile people want Tesla to succeed, I don't see much of the same here. They're just a player with lots of volume, and no idea what to do with it. Let's see what earnings call has in store.", "created_utc": 1565060210, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cml0st/im_going_bear_on_aig/", "is_self": true}
