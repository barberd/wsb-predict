These guys gotta be ground to a halt. \n\n\n$SIRI Sirius XM \n\nPosition: 4/17 $5 Put at $0.65/$65 per contract \n\nRationale: Advertising is one of the first things cut in a recession and good luck getting people to sign up now that everyone will be watching their spending. Plus, SIRI hasn\u2019t seen nearly the drop other advertisers have so far (SIRI at -30% over the last 30 days while other media companies are -60%+)\n\n\n$OUT Outfront Media \n\nPosition: 4/17 $7.50 Put for $1.15/$115 per contract \n\nRationale: Already down -70%, but when marketers have to cut budget, they\u2019re likely to cut out of home ads first before digital alternatives. \n\n\n$WHR Whirlpool \n\nPosition: 4/17 $75 Put at $4.05/$405 per contact\n \nRationale: No ones going to be willingly upgrading their appliances anytime soon. They\u2019re going to get pinched hard with declining sales. While Home Depot is open, many of their other retail partners are closing. Stocks down -38% over last 3 months, but there\u2019s more room to drop. \n\n\n$TXRH Texas Roadhouse \n\nPosition: 4/17 $25 Put for $3.30/$330 per contract \n\nRationale: Faired much better than most other food service thanks to great financials (no debt, lots of real estate) but they\u2019ve moved to takeout only. Who wants takeout steak? \n\n\nAll that said... SPY $238 4/1", "created_utc": 1584595856.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fl4nn4/cheap_puts_still_available/", "is_self": true}
