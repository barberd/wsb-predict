Made a lot of money on stupid positions that I didn\u2019t even fully understand. Lost some money. Lost a lot of money repeating the same stupid mistake. But most of all I have paid a stupid amount of money in taxes. In my opinion this is the biggest flaw in investing. If you win you pay. That being said I have decided to start my own church. This is the loop hole no one is talking about. Not going to you get free money from your members but you then don\u2019t have to pay taxes when you make money with their money! It\u2019s the perfect strategy. If you lose? It\u2019s their money! As far they are concerned it is already gone. If you win? You keep ALL the money.
