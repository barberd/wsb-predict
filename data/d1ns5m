Seriously though, been investing in biotech as a Shkrelli wannabe.  I work in the industry, name of company will not be disclosed.  Ticket to look at is below.\n\nAIMT\n\nThis Friday there will be a meeting held by the FDA, it\u2019s called an FDA advisory committee meeting.  Pretty much the FDA doesn\u2019t know what to do with an application and asks random retards to vote. Treatment is for peanut allergy.  Chances are, you know someone who has a peanut allergy.\n\nEasy bro.  Be an autist like me, \n\nBuy 25 strike calls that expire sep 20th.  Can\u2019t go tits up.\n\nEasy money.  Volatility should also go up in anticipation.\n\nDid my DD.  Efficacy is good but safety can be an issue.  Overall risk benefit (learn this autists for biotech) is favorable.  IMO.\n\nThey got money in the bank, about 200m.  Will have to raise money after approval expected in Jan.\n\nThis Wednesday, briefing documents are expected to come out (all the info FDA wants to let the panelists know how shitty the drug is).  But before this as I don\u2019t think there is anything already out, (ICER report already highlighted shitty parts).\n\nawood310 Your Btech prince while the king is out (Shkrelli)", "created_utc": 1568015098, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d1ns5m/aimt_litterally_cant_go_tits_up/", "is_self": true}
