Their media lies and only speculate that they are recovering. Leading indicators like PMI tell a different story.\n2. They went absolutely ballistic in their response due to SARS fears.\n3. No other country (except Singapore) is taking the crackdown response China has. Other countries are gonna take a harder hit than China.\n4. The US in particular was inflated.

Foreign countries were injecting money to prop their economies up... and this money got quickly invested into the US as a safe haven.
