Shit if they want to do it, then I'm fucking dooooown.\n\nSo I fired up my old robinhood account and great there was about $95 left from buying Snap options when that shit was like $5 and went to $11. \n\nThat wasn't enough to buy anything good and I needed some $$$ to contribute to valentine's day for the throuple I'm currently in, so I thought why not just risk everything on some sports bets. \n\n**It only works 100% of the time.** \n\nHere is what happened. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x7kthwl4rpj41.png?width=1122&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ff0f3e2046391bb8cccd620bfaf0adaf7bd39f4\n\nYou'll notice that the Bucks over is in the parlay. It wasn't supposed to hit, but if you look at the 4Q it did hit. So like I said this strategy works 100% of the time when you need money. \n\nI went downstairs and told my bookie (my mom) to pay me immediately so that I could use the funds to buy some put options via advice from cat lady on reddit.  She was pretty pissed and couldn't believe it but she paid out. \n\nI then hooked up to my neighbor's wifi Parasite style and bought a few puts on Royal Carribbean. Not sure why I picked them because this shit was only going on in China but it has paid off so far. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8kt5iv92spj41.jpg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e47d4e5a636d968f7f63045e064d2df8fdbe2bb\n\nThis made me confident and I've been buying more puts on all kinds of weird shit in foreign countries where there have been no signs of the corona virus. \n\nBut you know the fun is ending now and the week is over and I have no clue what to do. My throuple says we should all go to Disney in Japan after it re-opens in a few months. \n\n**What say you WSB?**", "created_utc": 1582917381, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fazxsh/twitter_tips_sports_picks_rcl_put_gains_but_need/", "is_self": true}
