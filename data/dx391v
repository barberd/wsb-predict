The way I see it I'm collecting premium and a swing trade if called away...worst case I hold what I got and sell another call option 1SD off and collect dividends in the aristocrats. \n\nTom is either supporting straight up gunslinging lately or I've been learning more and it's seeming more and more like he's a shill for TD. I understand the problems in the past and have called more than a few times for him to talk in circles to have Tony agree...but both are of the thought covered calls and cash secured puts are horrible investment ideas. \n\nWhat say you idiot savants? Thanks to Millionaire Mikey Mike for the videos and me being here. I don't know what I'm doing, but I sure want to gamble with some of you. I'm still a poor, teach me to invest?", "created_utc": 1573885195, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dx391v/tom_sosnoff_tdameritrade_tos_tastywhatevershill/", "is_self": true}
