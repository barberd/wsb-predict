Their clothing is either branded (Nike, Adidas, etc.) or their own. Delayed clothing tariffs won't affect their production yet and they continued selling their own merchandise as normal. Their biggest clothing brands beat ERs too. Adidas and Hanes beat earnings, Nike didn't but this shouldn't affect Urban too much as nike did report growth in their last quarter.\n\nGoogle trends have been increasing for urban outfitters too. This shows that zoomers are searching it up more and ordering clothes from their website \nhttps://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=urban%20outfitters&amp;geo=US\n\nOne of their competitors, Asos, grew 14% in their last quarter. Asos is basically the same as urban outfitters so this just means that the market is expanding. \n\nUrbn has consistently beaten expectations and I think that it will beat this earnings report as well. I'm going to buy calls unless someone can convince me otherwise\n\nTLDR buy $URBN calls", "created_utc": 1566311823, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cszvx6/urbn_dd_er_play_buy_calls/", "is_self": true}
