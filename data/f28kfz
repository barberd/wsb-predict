{"id": "f28kfz", "title": "MSFT, ETF Algorithms, and Weaponized Autism for Finding the Next Meme Stock", "selftext": "As some people have pointed out previously, a Bloomberg article suggesting that when there is an influx of options activity, algorithms progressively buy the underlying shares in order to delta hedge short term price changes. This in effect contributes towards the overall volume, which then is either picked up by other algorithms or retail investors in a positive feedback loop. \n\nWhich institutions have the most capital firepower in order to be able to execute this hedging? ETFs. ETFs comprise almost more than 50% of all capital inflows (looking at you Blackrock and Vanguard). To track their benchmark or themes, ETFs have a tracking error and attempt to minimize this. This is speculation, but most likely through a mix of options trading and purchasing/selling the underlying securities. \n\nNow, why does this not work for all meme stocks and only worked so far for Microsoft? ETFs have strict inclusion criteria when adding stocks to their indices. This includes liquidity, capital, and other requirements. If you take a look at Vanguard's total market ETF, VTI, their top holding is... Microsoft. \n\nDue to the collective hivemind nature of WSB, if we combine our autism and select the next meme stock in a top holding of major ETFs, I wonder if focused purchasing of options in a single stock that we meme would be sufficient to generate enough volume from ETFs to increase the price. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr is MSFT just on a tear lately or do ETF algorithms contribute to overinflation of asset prices?", "created_utc": 1581428974, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f28kfz/msft_etf_algorithms_and_weaponized_autism_for/", "is_self": true}
