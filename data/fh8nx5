Obama's stimulus during the 2008 crisis was around 2% of GDP (clarification: spread through 2009-2010, so it is the same magnitude within half the timeframe).\n\nHow can things simultaneously be O.K. while also needing twice as much stimulus as the biggest financial crisis since the great depression? Wouldn't this be completely unprecedented in scale, aside from the 1930s New Deal measures and major war mobilizations?\n\nThe stock market is going to the center of the earth.\n\nEDIT: Source for just the elimination of payroll taxes till the end of the year costing 900 billion dollars:  [https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/10/trump-economy-coronavirus-stcok-market-limited/](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/10/trump-economy-coronavirus-stcok-market-limited/) \n\nHe also wants to bailout plenty of other shit.", "created_utc": 1583977805.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fh8nx5/trump_is_requesting_a_stimulus_that_would_be/", "is_self": true}
