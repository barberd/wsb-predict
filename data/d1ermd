{"id": "d1ermd", "title": "FSLY Short Squeeze potential", "selftext": "A few people have asked me to look into FSLY's prospects as a short squeeze so here is what I have found. I go off of S3's data since it seems to be the most accurate. As recently as August 23rd, FSLY short interest was 4.7m shares, or approximately 54% of the float. The borrow fee was negligible, however, at just 1.61%. \n\nSince then, however, things have gotten more interesting. S3 put it on their list of top borrow fees. The short interest is now 61.7% of the float and the borrow fee has gone up to 57.9% as of this past Friday. \n\nI don't know a TON about Fastly's business other than they describe it as an edge cloud platform but it looks to be mostly a CDN. As in, they host sites and data for other businesses around the world in order to give their customers' faster loading times. They also upsell services and security. Big competitor in the space is AKAM. I don't know enough to say one is better than the other. But to me it looks to be a space that requires a decent amount of capital investment and has some well funded competitors. That likely explains the short interest. As with my prior short squeeze plays, I like that. Because it means the shorts will be stubborn and want to short more on valuation concerns until the borrow rate rises enough to squeeze them out of their position. \n\nI bought calls. My contracts are: 10/18/19 Calls with $40 strike and 300 of the 12/20/19 Calls $50 strike.", "created_utc": 1567967328, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d1ermd/fsly_short_squeeze_potential/", "is_self": true}
