{"id": "fl2pdo", "title": "Options is NOT Gambling", "selftext": "Good evening to literally everyone on planet Earth except the new logo,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have been seeing an influx of *autists* on here saying crazy things like \"options is gambling!\" & \"we're all gamblers here\"... No... NO. Let me fucking tell you something... You're WRONG. \n\nOptions is NOT gambling. It is AGGRESSIVE INVESTING. \n\nI have gambled at the casino, I have gambled on scratch off tickets, I have gambled on my guy Tom Brady to whoop the rest of the NFL's ass, and I have also gambled on my Sacramento Kings to actually win basketball games (of course, I have lost literally every single one of those)\n\nBut I have never, EVER, had a win ratio with those \"bets\"  like I have had with options. You're not able to fucking **take profits** if your football team is up during halftime. That is the glory in options. Options is not gambling, it is aggressive investing. God damnit. Get it straight. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TooLong;ICantReadWords** Tesla 370P 4/9", "created_utc": 1584586761.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fl2pdo/options_is_not_gambling/", "is_self": true}
