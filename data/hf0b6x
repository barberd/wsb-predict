{"id": "hf0b6x", "title": "$RKUNY - Earnings Play", "selftext": "Rakuten is a Japanese corporation, it is pretty big and rivals the likes of Amazon in Japan (25% market share in online commerce). They have expanded into many things since their foundation, and very recently (April 2020) became a telecom provider in Japan. They have earnings scheduled on the 26th of June, and with Japan being in lockdown for the previous month or so I can see them beating projections very easily. ([https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/05/14/japan-coronavirus-pandemic-lockdown-testing/](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/05/14/japan-coronavirus-pandemic-lockdown-testing/))\n\nIt is very stable in price, but the telecom aspect is new. They might gain a huge market share down the line. They own travel agencies, golf resorts, and handle bookings, with tourism opening up. Viber also belongs to them, and that makes some good money too, as a Whatsapp alternative.\n\nTheir balance sheet is strong, and they are sitting on a huge pile of cash (13B dollars). Diverse services and a huge name presence in Japan, as well as exposure due to soccer (a major sponsor of FC Barcelona). PE ratio of 9.25 is below average, but I think lockdown did them justice due to increased online sales.", "created_utc": 1593002428.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hf0b6x/rkuny_earnings_play/", "is_self": true}
