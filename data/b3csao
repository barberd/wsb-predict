As you'd expect, there's a lot of b/s lines titles something along the lines of \"cash from securities sold but not yet repurchased\" among others, referring to cash from their short positions et al. \n\nMy question is, when calculating EV, should I still just be including regular cash or cash from short positions too? And on the flip side, should I be including any of the short position liabilities in my calculation of net cash? Or solely LT debt?\n\nAs of right now I'm not including any of those lines, solely regular cash and LT debt, but also including customer deposits etc in LT debt.
