{"id": "gqxvz3", "title": "Our Country is Sick and it is Due", "selftext": "Looking the S&P futures, I am upset that I keep losing ground, but I am also nervous about what it all means.  The United States, is sick, and it is like the market does not care.  The higher it goes, the worse the sickness is; as if hope-ium is a drug that will pull us through all of this if we ignore reality long enough. I wanted to point out highlights of why this market cannot continue even as it seems to reach new highs.\n\n1. **Corona-virus is still here -** After watching videos with people going to the beach, you can see people are unconcerned about an invisible disease that just does not seem to impact that all.  However, the videos are only display a fraction of the total population.  If 10% of the population is being careless that still leaves 90% acting responsibly.  The people staying home cutting their spending which ends up hurting business. Individuals going in public without precautions will continue to drive infections and therefor deaths ensuring the cycle will be extended.\n2. **PPP is ending -** This program will be coming to an end pretty soon, without an increase in revenues, companies are going to let more staff go at the end of it.  It is also unlikely that this program will be renewed in our current political climate. This will drive up unemployment.\n3. **Unemployment is 25% and rising -** Rising unemployment will continue and shows no signs of stopping.  Businesses opening up, but without a restoration to previous spending, will have to declare bankruptcy. This will increase in unemployment without and reduce the number of potential employers in the future.\n4. **Unemployment benefits are ending -** The program offering supplemental unemployment from the federal government will come to an end soon. The republicans, in a desire to force an economic recovery, having been complaining about people earning too much money and want to kill it.  Some states just don't have a budget to pay this many people for so long, are also trying to push people off.\n5. **Banks are not lending -** As much as the Fed wants to lend out money and purchase bonds, they cannot force banks to lend money, especially to businesses that, at best appear to be just trying to survive and are more likely to go go bankrupt..\n6. **No one is hiring -** Without any increase in business, no one will be hiring, at least enough to make a dent in the unemployment numbers.\n7. **GDP is down -**  High unemployment and conservative spending will drive down GDP.  It has been estimated that 38 to 48% drop in GDP for the second quarter.  There is no reason to believe, with increasing unemployment and lack of government support, that spending will not continue to be low throughout the year. There will be no bounce back.\n8. **It is an election year -** This is important because the one entity that could do something drastic would be the federal government, in particular Congress.  The Feds cannot give money to directly to people, only indirectly through banks, and by purchasing bonds.  Congress on the other-hand has two parties with major disagreements on policies.  The one thing they can agree on is supply side economics, supporting businesses, but both of them are unwilling to support workers which would be the demand side.  I find it unlikely that they will pass anything, and if they do, it will not go to people to actually need it.\n9. **Cash is King -** With all the hope-ium out there now, I think investors are clinging onto the fantasy that we can recover quickly and pretend this was nothing. If things continue to look bad through the summer and go down hill, they will need cash. At some point they are going to have to pull it out. I don't believe they will do so until they feel like they have no choice.  \n\nI don't have any predictions here, I am just concerned about the total disconnect between the stock market and the rest of the country and I am concerned about the future as the country seems to be unwilling to confront reality, more or less fix anything.", "created_utc": 1590502722.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gqxvz3/our_country_is_sick_and_it_is_due/", "is_self": true}
