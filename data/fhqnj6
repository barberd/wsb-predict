It was there after close. Around 7pm tonight I saw it was no longer in my options list. 809pm I get notification my spy put is cancelled. None of the other puts I bought today got cancelled, just this one (my most profitable). \n\nWHAT IS HAPPENING\n\nEDIT: seems like I'm not the only one and it happened on E-Trade too. Orders placed right at circuit breaker were filled on the app, but not the NYSE. Well fuck me!! I'm looking for advice now on what to buy tomorrow, this put was $775 today and now it's priced at $1144. And I'm out of cash and not eligible for instant deposit.
