{"id": "fvj571", "title": "Zoom Communications and the Chinese Government", "selftext": "I heard this from my wife's boyfriend's daughter's father's boyfriend so you know it's good. He's also Chinese and works closely within the tech space.\n\nZoom's operations in the US is limited to mainly advertising, sales and customer support. There's a light group of software engineers, but those are mostly front end.\n\nThe back end - the real tech - is all developed in China. Why? Because it's cheap and Chinese engineers are actually very good and able to work the schedule. Thus, essentially ZM is like WeBull, but on a way more scary scale because they collect all kinds of data - biometric, business, communications and more.\n\nIn order to get to this size, and being located/closely linked to China, of course the Chinese government is involved. The Chinese government sees this as a golden goose that just dropped into their laps - and conforms with what the Chinese government wants: foreign data (again, biometric, business and communications). The fact that ZM has had so many issues with privacy in recent days is showing cracks in the dyke: Chinese engineers don't care about privacy and thus don't work it into the software, and all this leaked data of course finds its way to the Chinese government.\n\nTLDR: ZM will have its own LK moment or worse as they are implicated with the Chinese government. We just don't know when. ZM $50p Mar 2021. Might as well MSFT $200c Mar 2021 to hedge.", "created_utc": 1586113177.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fvj571/zoom_communications_and_the_chinese_government/", "is_self": true}
