I myself have already have assets to lose but if your young with nothing you got to aim higher. I\u2019m talking hostile corporate takeover. This is Robinhood. You can be the young gunnin corporate raiders of the 21st century. Buy controlling interest in a company. Some people already mentioned Hooters which is a great idea. You just need about $4-8m in leverage to buy controlling stake. If your gonna risk it all you should think big. Buy Hooters, throw a dope Hooters party for the new owners and invite me. I\u2019ll be there to pay you on the back and buy you a beer, and BOOM profit because I\u2019m buying your beer... you champion", "created_utc": 1573587311, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dvf0en/to_all_you_autists_with_nothing_to_lose_using/", "is_self": true}
