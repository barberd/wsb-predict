{"id": "by4h96", "title": "Congressional activity: week of 6/10 to 6/14", "selftext": "Good Friday, and welcome to this installment of Congressional activity and financial markets. The general idea is that the statements and actions of federal legislators can have an effect on broader markets. I try to provide interesting happenings as well as participants. I don't suggest any specific positions: I'd like those to come from consensus in the discussion.\n\nA few things to keep in mind:\n\n- All of this is subject to change at any time (i.e. votes can be delayed, hearings can be canceled, witnesses can be struck). The House and Senate operate under their own rules, and those rules are entirely enforced by the chambers themselves.\n- The House is controlled by Democrats, and the Senate is controlled by Republicans. So if a hearing is happening in the House, it is somewhat safe to assume that it reflect a relatively liberal position. However, the committees have representation by both parties, so the discussion won't be entirely one-sided.\n- In general, recorded votes on the ``floor'' of either chamber are taken the most seriously, followed by votes (or hearings) taken by the full committee, followed by votes (or hearings) by a subcommittee.\n- The Senate is generally taken more seriously than the House, since it moves slower and is less likely to produce legislation. Thus, the legislation it does produce is exceptionally important. A corollary, though, is that the Senate has much less activity in any given week (only 100 members, but the same workload [plus appointments] as the 435-member House).\n- The floor schedule of either chamber is notoriously hard to predict more than a day or two in advance, as it is structured almost entirely by party leadership and can change on the whims of that leadership. Hearings, however, are relatively more stable and scheduled. (In other words, the hearings are much more certain to happen, while the votes can be added or subtracted with much less certainty.)\n- This is not all activity, just activity most likely to be relevant to financial markets. There is also no guarantee this activity has an effect on any individual stock or market. I'm not an expert, and this is not advice. It is the beginning of a discussion.\n\n***\n\nResults from last week:\n\n- All of the VA record stocks were boosted on 6/4\n- GILD dropped a full dollar through the morning of 6/5 during subcommittee hearings on medical patents\n\n***\n\nShared activity (across both chambers):\n\nMore slamming of healthcare companies. One of the most important committees in the House (Ways and Means) will hold hearings on 6/12 on pathways to universal healthcare coverage (https://waysandmeans.house.gov/legislation/hearings/pathways-universal-health-coverage). The House will also hold subcommittee hearings on 6/12 on surprise medical bills (https://energycommerce.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/hearing-on-no-more-surprises-protecting-patients-from-surprise-medical), which often incldues language about fair pricing and transparent procedures. This is paired with Senate subcommittee hearings on 6/12 on vertical consolidation and competition in the healthcare industry (https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/your-doctor/pharmacist/insurer-will-see-you-now-competitive-implications-of-vertical-consolidation-in-the-healthcare-industry). \n\nThe House (https://agriculture.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=821) and Senate (https://www.agriculture.senate.gov/hearings/certainty-in-global-markets-for-the-us-agriculture-sector) will both hold hearings on 6/11 and 6/13 (respectively) on ``certainty in global markets for US Agriculture.'' This reads to me as a thinly veiled description of the effect of agricultural tariffs on American products in China. Each of the witnesses listed in the Senate hearing (no witness list yet for the House) has a track record of pumping the likelihood of a deal (Robert Johanson, Ted McKinney, and Gregg Doud [https://www.hayspost.com/2019/05/17/u-s-trade-reps-expect-deal-will-be-reached-with-china-eventually/]). Gregg Doud also happens to be the Chief US Agricultural Negotiator, and has been on record as stating that ``these conversations have been historic, in my opinion.'' \n\n***\n\nIt's potentially a busy week in the House!\n\nThe House is likely to take a vote on HR 3151, a bill to modernize the Internal Revenue Service (https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20190610/BILLS-116hr3151-SUS.pdf). The important thing is that the bill does not codify an agreement between the IRS and private tax filers (like Intuit) to offer free online tax filing (https://www.law360.com/articles/1166628/in-win-for-critics-revised-irs-bill-excludes-free-file). This is likely a boon to those companies. \n\nThe House is likely to take a vote on a giant package for Labor; Health and Human Services; Education; Legislative Branch; Defense; State; Foreign Operations; and Energy and Water Development Appropriations (https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20190610/BILLS-116HR2740-RCP116-17.pdf). The bill is massive. The appropriations bill includes some combative language with student loan providers, specifically ``the Department to award student loan servicer contracts on the basis of their past performance and compliance with Federal and state law. It also requires the Department to prioritize services to help borrowers avoid delinquency or default in contract solicitations and for the Department to include account- ability measures that account for the performance of the portfolio and contractor compliance with FSA guidelines'' (https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CRPT-116hrpt62/pdf/CRPT-116hrpt62.pdf, [12]). The bill also derides for-profit colleges (``Oversight of For-Profit Colleges: Protecting Students and Taxpayer Dollars from Predatory Practices''). \n\nThis pairs with additional House hearings on 6/11 on student loan servicing (https://financialservices.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=403828), which includes Consumer Financial Protection advocates on the witness list. \n\nThe House is likely to take a vote on HR 1158, a bill to develop cyber incident response teams through the Department of Homeland Security (https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/116/hr1158/text). It makes specific provision for private cybersecurity specialists to help on these teams, which might open the door for private contracts to security firms. \n\nThe House will markup bills on 6/11 related to reauthorization of the Flood Insurance Program (https://financialservices.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=403829). Flood insurance and its availability are starting to become a more salient national issue (https://www.npr.org/2019/06/07/730758882/many-people-living-in-flood-prone-areas-cant-afford-expensive-flood-insurance). There isn't a private provider because the claims are so expensive, and underwriting them would be exceptionally expensive. \n\nThe House is likely to take a vote on H. Res. 430, a resolution to compel witnesses generally, but AG Barr and Donald McGahn specifically, to comply with House subpoenas (https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/BILLS-116hres430ih/pdf/BILLS-116hres430ih.pdf). This will escalate tensions between House Democrats and White House witnesses, and it could also set of a classic Twitter battle. This is paired with additional (double) hearings on the Mueller Report (https://judiciary.house.gov/legislation/hearings/lessons-mueller-report-presidential-obstruction-and-other-crimes and https://intelligence.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=654). \n\n***\n\nThe Senate will hold oversight hearings on 6/12 on the FCC (https://www.commerce.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/hearings?ID=AE64FD09-95B1-407D-8A87-8CBEE10665A4). Ajit Pai is listed as a witness, so there's the off chance that they might be pressed on popular policy initiatives like net neutrality. \n\nThe Senate will hold subcommittee hearings on 6/11 on intellectual property and patents (https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/the-state-of-patent-eligibility-in-america-part-iii). There's an interesting list of witnesses, including an SVP from Qualcomm (through the patent dispute with Apple, no doubt), an executive from Nokia, and a variety of healthcare companies, including JNJ. Generally, appearing before Congress isn't good.\n\nThe Senate will hold full committee hearings on 6/11 on data brokers and financial privacy (https://www.banking.senate.gov/hearings/data-brokers-and-the-impact-on-financial-data-privacy-credit-insurance-employment-and-housing). Any company that deals in data (Equifax, etc.), especially financial data, is likely to get a mention.", "created_utc": 1559971188, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/by4h96/congressional_activity_week_of_610_to_614/", "is_self": true}
