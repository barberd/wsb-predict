Be that as it may, I think I've found the golden pass into infinite tendies, and I'd like to share my play with you, so you can call me retarded (but don't, since comparing me to actually mentally-handicapped people is extremely offensive to them).   \n\n\nNow there's this company called JOYY INC ($YY), of which I got acquainted with by searching for the [Top of all time post on /r/wsb](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/top/?t=all). Now this company showcases absurd revenue growth, it's actually making money, and has huge operational margins. Balance sheet looks solid af. Like, please, someone tell me what the fuck is wrong here. Like, even if you value it at like half of what $SNAP is worth, you are walking away with 100% gains. Company is only worth 4.2B. And everything on this one looks better, from growth to... everything. I mean, I understand it's a chinese company but come on. It is right now near it's 6-month support and yada yada a bunch of voodoo TA shit that don't work. \n\nHell, even the morons that call themselves \"analysts\" hold the stock on high regard. Deutsche Bank has a price target on it of 83, JPMorgan 90, Goldman Sachs 84.. And these are grey-haired boomers how actually know what they are talking about (altho imo most \"\"\"analysts\"\"\" are a bunch of scammers and dumbasses). \n\nAnyway, I'll tell you my play right now \n\nBought YY calls strike 85 exp january 15th 2021.\n\nYeah right now it just closed at 52.79\n\nThat's more than a year from now. If the JPMorgan boomer is right I'm looking at 175% gains. If they and me turn out to be wrong, well, I'll have a whole year to make that up I guess. \n\nAnyway, you heard it here first.
