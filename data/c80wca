{"id": "c80wca", "title": "How to play July", "selftext": "Disclaimer: this DD is not very autistic in the sense that it\u2019s not much of an FD/gamble. But I\u2019m seeing a lot of people that want to make smart plays and/or join theta gang, and I think we have here a fantastic opportunity to make an easy 10% in three weeks. So if you\u2019re looking for that, here we go with a good starting point. Again, not autistic, but a good play. \n\nIF you believe the following three premises, then I think you can easily make 10% in just three weeks. \n\n1. Trump and Xi will not come to a trade agreement this month. \n\n2. Earnings will generally be muted at best, and most likely straight up disappointing. \n\n3. The Fed will not cut interest rates this month unless the economy tanks. \n\nThe play: Sell solidly OTM call spreads on SPY. My personal favorite: 7/26 $302/$305 spreads.  I sold a bunch before close for $53/spread. The plan is to close for $23/spread for 10% gains ($30 on each $300 of collateral). \n\nDiscussion:\n\n1. Trump and Xi will not come to an agreement this month. We have yet to see anything from China that indicates they are willing to give ground on the fundamental issues. Meanwhile Trump keeps emphasizing that any deal must favor the US. China has made moves to become less reliant on the US in anticipation of extended tariffs. This recent truce involved no actual progress on key disagreements. Perhaps a deal is made eventually, but not soon. \n\n2. Earnings start ramping up this month. Most companies are toning down guidance and reporting that performance will decline year over year due to the effects of tariffs and slowed production. With no end in sight of the substantial tariffs, guidance will be low and expectations will be tempered. We aren\u2019t going to see the types of earnings beats that cause stocks to push past ATHs. In addition, more and more articles will come out highlighting these facts over the next few weeks. \n\n3.  The Fed will not cut rates this month. The economy is still healthy. It\u2019s not booming in the same way that it has been, but the primary goals of the fed are under control. Despite more dovish language at their last meeting, the Fed is still in a \u201cwait and see\u201d attitude about rate cuts and does not want to pull the trigger prematurely. If really bad economic data comes out, they could lower rates. But their dot plot actually shows very minor rate cuts before more rate hikes in the coming years. It would take a harsh economic downturn to force their hand (which would likely be fine for this play as well). If the economy tanks, selling calls is a good play. \n\nTherefore, I see no catalysts that can push us higher than the $297 area we could not push through on this weekend\u2019s news. The market might not go down, because Trump is a master at propping it up, but there is no real reason to push through and blast through ATH without one of the three fundamental issues above changing. \n\nSo enter the spreads and relax for a month of slow burn gains- if you want to join theta gang or bear gang, this is your invitation.", "created_utc": 1562018938, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c80wca/how_to_play_july/", "is_self": true}
