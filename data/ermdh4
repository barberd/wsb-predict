{"id": "ermdh4", "title": "Charles Schwab Option Assignment Procedure", "selftext": "Hello WallStreet Bets,\n\nIn a defined risk strategy, say a credit spread. If my short gets assigned and I do not have the required capital for assignment. What is Schwab's procedure in this situation? I know my options when dealing w/ assignment 1) Exercise long option, 2) sell or buyback the stock received or sold during assignment 3) Hold onto the stock (not an option due to insufficient capital). \n\nLet's say I do not have the required capital in my account to deal with the assignment.  I know I can perform steps 1 and 2 to get myself out of the assignment, but will Schwab slap a flag on my account? Let's say this happens multiple times over the course of a year, due to the nature of options trading. And my final question, how much time does Schwab give you to deal with this margin call?\n\nLet me state: I only care about how the broker Charles Schwab deals with this issue. Please do not post responses that deal with other brokers (i.e. Robinhood, TDAmeritrade, etc.). \n\nThank You Kind Internet Dwellers,\n\nred2green", "created_utc": 1579565732, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ermdh4/charles_schwab_option_assignment_procedure/", "is_self": true}
