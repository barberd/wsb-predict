Both companies with strong sales, great revenue, and they have the subscriber counts to back those numbers. They will not be delisted any time soon, but retards with their stim checks are out there pretending like they know anything about stonks adding to the fuel of bs that is CNBC. Hell I think these writers don\u2019t even really realize what this is all about. \n\nOn the BABA earnings. A 0.43 EPS beat (1.30 v 0.87) and a $1B revenue beat (16.14B v 15.2B) and the stock plunges 5%. What a damn shame. Company even projected closed to 91B in revenue by 2021 with 990B annual active users.\n\nJD on the other hand with some of the best logistics of an e-commerce and brick and mortar in the world is getting dumped on the same news. This company wasn\u2019t a shit storm like Amazon when COVID-19 news broke because their logistics network is just that good. They also plan to list in HK on June 11th, which adds more operating cash when they plan to sell 5% of their company stake for ~$5B. \n\nAnyhow, you guys will be seeing some more retards posting news articles on \u201cChinese stocks delisting\u201d when they are oblivious to the fact that this does not affect companies like BABA and JD, among others.", "created_utc": 1590160341.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gol4p0/the_amount_of_misinformation_in_these_cnbc/", "is_self": true}
