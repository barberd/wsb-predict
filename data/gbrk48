If you look at the charts of SPY and Nasdaq over the weeks of the Fed's purchases then you will see that there is a near 1:1 correlation.  Less Fed interference means less bull juice.   It's a sad state of affairs when we have to look at the central bank's activities as an active market participant as a fundamental indicator.  But at least they posted the schedule ahead of time.  Keep in mind this is only a TENTATIVE schedule and is subject to revision.  But so far this is the lowest amount of money they have committed (post - Coronavirus shutdown).  \n\nEDIT: Meant to write that the Fed purchased less before the Coronavirus shutdown in the USA but that was also during all time equity highs.  \n\n[https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/markets/treasury-securities-schedule-past/HTPC\\_0504\\_0508\\_2020.pdf](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/markets/treasury-securities-schedule-past/HTPC_0504_0508_2020.pdf)\n\nTLDR:  Less fed purchases mean a better chance of put value accelerating.
