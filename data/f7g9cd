It is currently being used in 30 countries I believe it is in the preliminary stage for FDA approval.\n\n**Tell me more.**\n\nThey are currently making a study if they can use  Cannabidivarin(CBDV) to cure all of us for our Autism this is big if true. There's gonna cure for us. Hold on to your tendies.\n\n**Hows the financial though BRUH?**\n\nCurrently, they are slated to lose 52c per share, but in 2018 they are reported to have lost 2.35 per share during the same quarter. That is a 79% share improvement from the previous year by the way they are reporting Q4 and Q1 on Tuesday (2/25)\n\n \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible launch year for any medication \\[that\\] I think proves that this kind of medicine is really making a difference to patients,\u201d GW Pharma CEO Justin Gover said after selling $296 million worth of Epidiolex in 2019. \n\nWhat's **the target price for this BRUH?**\n\nThe consensus target price for this company is $204 we are currently at $125 we are still 39% away from it we still have plenty of runways.\n\n**But what's the big jump from 2018 to 2019?**\n\nThe reason for the big jump is that the approval of FDA for Epidiolex and they are finally able to commercialize and sell their product in the US.\n\n**My position:** 150c 3/20\n\nTLDR: GW Pharmaceuticals is currently on sale with this dip they are expected to beat ER by a mile. ER report is on Tuesday (2/25). May the tendies be plentiful and merry for next week.
