So people won\u2019t wanna go out and buy shit. And there is a small scrappy Canadian company that delivers damn near anything. I am talking of course about the company you don\u2019t know and don\u2019t love..... Parcelpal Technology (active in a large Canadian city near you). Soon everyone will want their pre lubed dildos and weed (they deliver weed) brought to them. I did a lil DD and they have a high cash burn rate and some debt. But when corona hits hard I think they might take off.\nBut seeing ad I\u2019m not the sharpest tool in the shed and I don\u2019t trust myself I was wondering what all yall think about it.", "created_utc": 1584530238.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fknx3v/pickup_parcelpal_people/", "is_self": true}
