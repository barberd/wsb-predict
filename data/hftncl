Now it's looking like... hell no.\n\ntl;dr: read the fucking diligence to ingrate\n\n# S&P GLOBAL: \u201cNearly half (47%) of organizations with office space say they expect to reduce their physical office footprint as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. More than 20% expect to reduce it by more than 25%.\u201d\n\n[https://pages.marketintelligence.spglobal.com/MI-PC-MS-TMT-GL-200617-451COVIDFlashSurveyP2\\_1-DownloadRequest.html](https://pages.marketintelligence.spglobal.com/MI-PC-MS-TMT-GL-200617-451COVIDFlashSurveyP2_1-DownloadRequest.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCommercial real estate is going to get completely fucked up the ass in Q3. It's been uncertain until even this week, now biggest office using companies are saying they don't need anywhere near as much. $NRZ has upped their dividend so people don't think they are completely uninvestable, while they are hiding that they are a fucking leper. The companies with enough office space to break it down into increments have A LOT and dropping 25% is a shit ton. When they stop paying rent... the building is still there building debt for the real estate investment trusts that own it. How many new companies are there that will fit into all this unused space? Probably none, why would anyone want to\n\n2/3 of companies surveyed will do even more work from home than they are now or just setup universal WFH. That's straight cash money that will be coming out of the pocket of the building owners over the next 3 months as everyone announces their plans to stay the fuck at home. Building owner expenses stay the same or go up.\n\nLook back at 2010, commercial real estate got hammered but then slowly came back. Not happening this time, and the amount they still have to sink is huge [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704847104575532431543205138](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704847104575532431543205138)\n\n30% of all commercial real estate is office space. they are going to get destroyed the most\n\nSo what do we do?\n\nLet's look at the largest REITs, and then narrow that down to ones focused on commercial space, then narrow down to ones with primarily office space, then even further to narrow down to luxury white collar office space that is most easily to be able to be with WFH. That leaves us with: BXP, SLG, HPP, HIW, and CLI.\n\nBoston Properties (BXP) is the largest with the most expensive properties, highest overhead costs, lowest number of employees relatively. Their market cap is currently $14B, which is 15.8X their income per share. A ridiculous multiple that is dependent on them owning a lot of super stable long term money making assets, which they suddenly do not. They are less likely to get huge gov help since they don't employ that many people but hold a lot of assets, relative to their value. BXP net hired 0 (ZERO) people between 2018-2019, and have less than 800 employees total, so there is basically no reason to help them with money printer cash, who gives a shit if they lay off 6 people who arent related to anyone on the board. Their income falls 25% over the next 5 months, they will sell property just to stay afloat and the stock value could easily tank another 50% from where it is by the end of the year.\n\nNext item is BXP annual report from March 6th: [http://www.annualreports.com/HostedData/AnnualReports/PDF/NYSE\\_BXP\\_2019.pdfTheir](http://www.annualreports.com/HostedData/AnnualReports/PDF/NYSE_BXP_2019.pdfTheir)\n\n\"Strategy\" is all about \"maintaining\" great office spaces (that no one wants). Look at their greatest income generating properties, HQs for leidos and akamai and other big software companies which will all be the first to go full remote and totally be allowed to break their lease because of force majeure and BXP being unable to provide the services required in their leases. The companies in their top earning properties are all posting remote/anywhere location jobs right now, my guess is they will be shutting down huge sections of their buildings and stopping paying rent on space they arent using soon.\n\nMoral of the story:\n\n**$BXP $70 puts for October 16th.**\n\nAlso buying stock in remote tools, zoom might be over hyped I dont know, so not touching it", "created_utc": 1593117389.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hftncl/commercial_office_space_reits_will_completely/", "is_self": true}
