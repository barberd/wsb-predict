{"id": "cdx5yw", "title": "Goodbye friends, it's been a long ride", "selftext": "In the past two maybe three years I got hooked on options trading (aka gambling). I ran up on AMD options back when it was $13-14 from $300 to $15K. Thought I was a god at trading and could just run it up to the millions. Clearly that's not what happened. I quickly lost all of it all and put more money in. To this date I probably lost around $25k maybe a little more (don't want to actually check and get depressed and kill myself :')). But finally I'm going to call it quits, I wasted the whole year's pay which for a 24 year old student is not much ($19k maybe), stuck in credit card debt and finally with some bad car troubles definitely need to stop gambling. It's been really fun reading posts on here and constantly checking stocks but I've deleted it all and just need to get fresh air. It's been fun guys, thanks for the ride. Others who are in the same boat, honestly, we have a gambling problem and just need to stop. We might hit it big but in the end if we keep going all the money disappears. Thankfully my debt is only about 3-4k which is a lot but manageable in probably a couple months of working and living frugally.
