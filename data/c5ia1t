I just finished losing $8,000 over the course of a year or so (guess I'm an autist too?) from buying calls/puts and decided it's time to switch up my strategy. I'm going to start selling covered calls and puts and was wondering if there is a historically ideal time to sell covered calls and puts. What I mean by that is if there is an ideal time to be targetting from the point of selling a call/put to expiration?\n\nIe. Should I sell a BYND call with 2 weeks until expiration or 4 weeks? Or weeks? Etc.\n\nObviously the conditions for what is truly \"ideal\" varies greatly from ticker to ticker, but I am curious if anyone has heard or know of a 'generally' good time span to begin targeting when looking to sell calls/puts...?\n\nOr maybe I'm just retarded.
