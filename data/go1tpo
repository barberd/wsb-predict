{"id": "go1tpo", "title": "EURN (Tanker) should be priced higher, and has some very good options plays", "selftext": "(Plays at end)\n\nThe tanker stock EURN currently is priced at a 2b market cap, and $9.69 (nice) per share. This company has a p/e earnings ratio of 6.4 which is the lowest of any tanker, and is over 3X lower then the s@p 500. In addition to this, they have an extremely high dividend, and will increase share buybacks when the next few quarters are insanely profitable.\n\nCurrently many places are opening up and just letting the coronavirus spread through their country, this will be bad for the tanker as oil will become in higher demand\n\nThe thing is, oil demand will not be at the same level as before, atleast for a year. No one is flying anywhere, no one is going on cruise ships, no new buildings are being built, (ect). And in the spanish flu there were 3 waves of the flu, which will most likely happen here too. We may have to go under another lockdown, and oil companies need places to store oil.\n\nOil tanker rates are still about 3X what they normally are at this time, and it will stay that way for awhile until oil demand picks back up fully.\n\nEURN is almost trading at the same value as the prevoius year, despite making more profits in 1 quarter then the whole last year. Q2 will nail it out of the park too, and I think that is when the market might price in how well it is doing\n\nTdlr: EURN is undervalued and has cheap calls, buy long dated calls\n\nPositions: 8/13 10c   the premium is only 70$, meaning that to make profit, eurn only has to go up about 10%. This is almost guaranteed to happen during a 5 month period", "created_utc": 1590084201.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/go1tpo/eurn_tanker_should_be_priced_higher_and_has_some/", "is_self": true}
