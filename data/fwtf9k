{"id": "fwtf9k", "title": "Boomer DD", "selftext": "So I called up my boomer grandpa to see how things were cracking up in his hood. He lives in NJ. Basically he told me a story abt how his friends son died from corona (RIP) and how much social distancing sucks for people his age. I could feel the fear radiating from him. The boomer panic has not been suppressed. I asked him about the stock market and trump ( he voted for him), and he said he couldn\u2019t stand to hear his voice as he fucked this whole thing up, and that his priority is staying alive, not his portfolio. He also told me a bunch of other boomer shit that he couldn\u2019t do, like walk on the boardwalk. Either way, he sounded nervous as fuck. I wished him well and went on my way.\n\nTl:dr: I called my grandpa, he sounded scared and therefore other old people are scared too and therefore puts will print because the panic has not subsided. \n\nSPY 220 7/17", "created_utc": 1586295971.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fwtf9k/boomer_dd/", "is_self": true}
