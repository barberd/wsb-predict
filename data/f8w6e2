I own KGC in my portfolio and I follow their management very closely. Really good turnaround stock that is producing gold at all time highs. Their mines are looking juicy and every time gold price goes up it is straight TENDIES for this company.\n\nI made a post a few weeks back about Barrick Gold calls that made me a killing. Barrick is usually quick to respond when gold price is going up, but following KGC for some time now, I realized they are sometimes on a lag. One day, Gold miners will be up and KGC will skyrocket the next day! Just a trend I've noticed. \n\nKGC is a great company and as we see the virus spreading in globally now at a rapid pace, the pain isn't over. Kinross has room to run and I am expecting a 7+% day when gold breaks out above $1,700 (where are all my TA boys)\n\nI sold my Barrick Gold calls as the run up has occurred and I am all in on 2/28 calls for $6.50. Get on board to RECOVER Monday losses and show Mr. Market who is boss!", "created_utc": 1582570969, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f8w6e2/kgc_is_the_move_to_groove/", "is_self": true}
