So with the autism disclosure out of the way, let\u2019s dive in.\n\nThe tender offer is contingent on financing, and payment of the stock (while above current prices) may not happen immediately.\n\nIn addition, while I think Altria would almost always reject these mini-tender offers, it\u2019s starting to show the value that Altria has at its current share price.\n\nJuul is still operating very well. Yes there\u2019s the vaping headlines. Yes they just got banned in India. Yes \u201cChina\u201d pulled them from Alibaba and JD.com (although baba and jd did not confirm the party instructed them to do so: per Forbes)\n\nCronos is the long term tailwind that doesn\u2019t get brought up. The Investment Banks that cover Altria don\u2019t even analyze the Cronos investment, because there is so much to unpack with the core PM USA, US Smokeless, the BUD stake, and of course Juul.\n\nI\u2019m fucking bullish as fuck and I\u2019m losing money every god damn day on this stock.", "created_utc": 1568846111, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d64ryd/altria_rejects_trc_minitender_4425/", "is_self": true}
