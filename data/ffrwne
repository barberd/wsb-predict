Increased regulatory scrutiny towards Boeing, especially with the FAA getting massive backlash for certifying it in the first place, will ensure no stone is un-turned before the Max is re-certified.\n\n\\-House Investigation absolutely trashes Boeing and how their company operates (a couple days ago)\n\n[https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/lawmakers-fault-faa-boeing-deadly-737-max-crashes-n1152086](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/lawmakers-fault-faa-boeing-deadly-737-max-crashes-n1152086)\n\n[https://www.bostonherald.com/2020/03/06/congressional-panel-says-boeing-has-culture-of-concealment/](https://www.bostonherald.com/2020/03/06/congressional-panel-says-boeing-has-culture-of-concealment/)\n\n\\- NASA finds potentially catastrophic issues in Boeing's Starliner program (2 days ago)\n\n[https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/03/nasa-declares-starliner-mishap-a-high-visibility-close-call/](https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/03/nasa-declares-starliner-mishap-a-high-visibility-close-call/)\n\n\\-USAF Publicly questions KC-46's ($BA's largest mil contract) viability, after continued issues, delays costing Boeing millions ( a few days ago)\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boeings-biggest-military-contract-hits-152004064.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boeings-biggest-military-contract-hits-152004064.html)\n\n\\- Boeing fined $20 Million by FAA for another discovered fuckup, nearly 800 planes with defective sensors (yesterday)\n\n[https://www.kiro7.com/news/local/faa-seeks-197-million-penalty-against-boeing-over-sensors/FGFCB7KUMFGAFC4FOYLPDBDWFE/](https://www.kiro7.com/news/local/faa-seeks-197-million-penalty-against-boeing-over-sensors/FGFCB7KUMFGAFC4FOYLPDBDWFE/)\n\n\\- 777X deliveries pushed back to 2021\n\n\\- Boeing didn't have a single order in\u00a0January 2020 and had negative orders for commercial jets in 2019, losing a net 87 orders . This is all before the slump the Aerospace industry is facing from Coronavirus, and as airlines are dumping Boeing for Airbus at an increasing rate.\n\n\\- Mooney's recently downgraded Boeing's unsecured\u00a0debt to Baa1, still investment grade but just three notches above junk status\n\nIn sum, the general consensus is that this shit is overvalued. Boeing is still riding out the power its name holds among the Boomers and hedge fund managers. I wouldn't be surprised if many big money investors look to dump $BA holdings as the company's near and mid-term future looks bleaker. The global market slump brought on by Coronoavirus, and the implications on the aerospace industry in particular could be the perfect trigger to drill the shares to Jan. 2017 prices of $160 or lower.\n\nMorningstar (ew) and some others seem to think Boeing is undervalued, as their \"stable\" backlog of orders is a glimpse into their future. I, and a majority of others disagree. Boeing is pissing off regulators and airline companies faster than new ones will ever be created.\n\nRevenue drops translate into cuts to research and development. Boeing is in this position in the first place because they chose the shoehorn new engines onto a barely reworked 737 fuselage. Why? Because they are cheap and were pressured by Airbus A32neo's large fuel efficiency gain. Boeing's board rejected this initially, and stalled until American Airlines made a contract with Airbus, then the abortion that is the 737 Max was created.\n\n**TL;DR: Boeing's future gets bleaker, and the companies loss of revenue gains for years to come not priced in. They continually push back goals, more fuckups are being uncovered, and the company is losing the war with Airbus. $BA is a sinking ship, and this market slump is going to be the trigger to tank Boeing's share price to a more realistic valuation.
