JPOW FTW. Stonks only go up.\n\nStock in space-tourism firm [Virgin Galactic Holdings](https://www.barrons.com/quote/SPCE) has fallen back to earth because of the [Covid-19 coronavirus](https://www.barrons.com/articles/covid-19-coronavirus-who-hopkins-data-statistics-update-51585050197?mod=article_inline)\n\noutbreak. Shares were down more than 70% from their February 2020 peak. on Wall Street. [Morgan Stanley](https://www.barrons.com/quote/MS)\u2019s Adam Jonas upgraded shares Tuesday to the equivalent of Buy. Even so, he cut his target price for shares [to $24 from $30 ](https://www.barrons.com/articles/virgin-galactic-stock-expensive-space-tourism-nasa-defense-51582816116?mod=article_inline).\n\n**\u201cThe world has changed in the past month,\u201d wrote Jonas in a Tuesday research report. \u201cHowever, the story and the balance sheet remain intact.\u201d Even with the market turmoil, he saw 90% upside in shares, catalyzing his ratings action.**\n\n**Some of that upside has already been eaten up. Virgin Galactic shares (ticker: SPCE) are up 22.2% Tuesday to $15.85. ($19.52 as I'm writing this)** The [S&P 500](https://www.barrons.com/quote/index/SPX) Is up 6.8%.\n\nIt\u2019s been an incredible ride for Galactic stock. At one point in February, shares were up more than 220% for the year. They fell 72% from their high to a low of $10.49. The stock was almost $13 before Jonas upgraded it. He referred to the stock as the \u201cgreat space coaster\u201d in his report. Given the volatility, that seems apt.\n\nThrough it all, shares were up about 12% year to date before Tuesday\u2019s upgrade-fueled jump. That\u2019s far better than comparable drops in the S&P 500 and the [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://www.barrons.com/quote/index/DJIA).\n\n**One reason Galactic has held up better is\u2014ironically\u2014because it doesn\u2019t have sales yet.** The company expects to start flying tourists to the edge of space in 2020. The lack of sales appears to be insulating the company from some of the worst of the Covid-19 fallout.\n\nIt\u2019s a strange situation, but bullish investors still believe in the promise of space tourism as well as other opportunities the company is pursuing. In the future, Galactic wants to expand from space flight into [hypersonic travel](https://www.barrons.com/articles/virgin-galactic-stock-is-a-bet-on-the-future-of-space-travel-how-much-is-that-worth-51582733503?mod=article_inline)\n\n\u2014that is, travel at about five times the speed of sound. In theory, a cross-country flight might take only an hour.\n\nJonas values the space tourism business at $14 a share and the hypersonic flight opportunity at $10 a share to arrive at his current target price.\n\nThe $10 hypersonic value is built on a belief that the market for ultrafast flight could hit $800 billion by 2040. Air travel globally, for context, generates about [$865 billion in sales](https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/pr/2019-06-02-01/?mod=article_inline).", "created_utc": 1586889403.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1b49x/virgin_galactic_stock_soars_because_covid19_cant/", "is_self": true}
