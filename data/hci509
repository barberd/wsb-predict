I just have no idea how we are going to be able to break the fourth wall and explain what is going on/will happen to everyone.\n\nMargot Robbie: \"Stock prices went down, so JPow copy and pasted $10,000,000,000,000 into SPY\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nANyways, just want to compile some scenes, actors, important events that should be included. There is a lot to cover\n\n&#x200B;\n\nScenes\n\n* Intro is Pre corona where everybody is happy and making money. Montages of Trump, industry, strippers, coke. \n* Some Chinese man eats a bat. Montages of virus spread: planes flying, old people on cruises, close ups of people sneezing and coughing while showing the spittle flying around.\n* Some professional trader who is also somehow a good, normal dude looks at the stock market while watching the news and buys puts. \n* Everybody locking down, fights at the store over toilet paper, empty streets\n* Average Joe professional trader makes a shit ton of money. Contrast with shots of baristas out of work.\n* Definitely going to have some Coronavirus task force pressers \n* Nice flyover shots of New York and the hospital ships\n* Our hero trader sees everything going on, doubles down on puts. Gets wrecked\n* People with variouus degrees of autism shown staring at phone while on couch. Camera pans around to show robinhood account day trading with $1200.\n* Montage of JPowell printing gun, congress hearings,.. etc.\n* Need a scene of hero trader yelling its all a fraud, crying in phone to mom. \n* ????????????\n* Who knows whats going to happen next\n* End on a hopeful note of hero trader moving some boxes into mom's basement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't fucking know. This shit is harder than it seemed at first.
