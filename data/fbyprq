I usually just buy and sell stocks because that's pretty easy to understand the basics of it. \n\nBut I went from 9k to about 5k in a single week. I was in a very dark place and desperate mood on Friday. Then I saw this \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b meme telling to \n1. Buy Puts\n2. Profit. \n\nWithout doing ANY research, I said fuck it and bought [this](http://imgur.com/gallery/I4DefKS)\n\nIt's very obvious to me that I'm not going to hit my strike price by expiration date now and that *I'm going to lose all my money. I understand that and i am fine with that now.*\n\nBut now I'm wondering if it's possible to go into debt with it. The more research I do the more confused I am. \n\nI thought a Put Option was just a bet that a stock would hit a strike price within the expiration date and that if it didnt, you would lose all the money you put in. \n\nBut then \nI started seeing A LOT of post about people going negative with put options. \n\nSo I need some help/clarification. \n\n1. First, can someone just verify if I'm going to go in debt because of my stupidity? I don't believe I used any margin to buy the Puts. I had 5K lf My own money and the Puts were around 3.5K\n\n2. Second, If $SPY falls about 5% on Monday due to the news, virus,  fear and stuff. Would selling the Puts (if I can find a buyer) be a good idea? When I bought the Put, $SPY started going down a bit and I saw my account go up to 6K at one point. Could I have sold there and kept the extra 1K? So if my account miraculously goes back to over 5K tomorrow, should I sell OR should I just let it expire?\n\n3. While researching, I remember someone comparing Options to an Insurance Company that bills you every month. So with this in mind, when expiration day passes, will it get renew and ask for another 3.5K?", "created_utc": 1583089226, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fbyprq/in_a_bit_of_a_desperation_move_i_bought_some/", "is_self": true}
