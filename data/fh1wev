{"id": "fh1wev", "title": "Unusual Options - T/BAC/DIS/", "selftext": "Today I included the aggressive orders, T seems really aggressive since the orders have come in the last 2 days heavy on puts.\n\nThese options orders are on or above the ask. Many have the same expiry and strike. Also lots  of the orders were sweeps so these ppl were  breaking  down their order to get filled faster.\n\nHere - [https://imgur.com/a/uW2JNFH](https://imgur.com/a/uW2JNFH)\n\nAlso all these orders volume of the contracts exceeded the open  interest in multiple trades so it's most likely not closing positions. Either buy to open orders or sell to open orders and based on the    aggressiveness of the orders one can infer its buy to  open.  Some of these may be hedges and some most likely not.\n\nThe T orders are very aggressive, normally T does not have so many sweeping orders especially all puts. Unsure if their is a dividend date or any news pending but that should be watched.  The NCLH was aggressive but those orders are already right and it's too late to chase. Ppl believe Bac will keep dropping.\n\nThese orders are from morning to now (2:24pm)\n\nDon't just enter YOLO's in positions based on this data alone in most cases. Use  technicals/fundamentals/options data/market feelings all combined instead of just 1 of these.   Use protection like spreads if you worry about losing what u put in and be  smart,  understand the  risks of putting $ into weekly expiry's, consider a longer expiry.\n\nAlso with the market going lower use technicals/fundamentals/options data-flow all combined. Someone said ibb has ads so use an adblocker we are in 2020\n\nWanted to add, People thought the SBUX puts couldn't happen back at this post, now they are raining in tendies. Anything is possible. I checked the prices today and those were 150-300% gainz - [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fdjwgq/unusual\\_options\\_sbuxfeyenflx/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fdjwgq/unusual_options_sbuxfeyenflx/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT - Wanted to add, I make these posts a lot with different tickers, when I am most confident I make a whole thread for one ticker. Like I did in the past with MSFT/AAPL/TSLA/DIS, I am saying this because I have different levels of confidence the orders will work out. These orders today are aggressive but not super super aggressive. So the confidence level is lower than something extremely aggressive and unusual like SBUX order flow.", "created_utc": 1583951655.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fh1wev/unusual_options_tbacdis/", "is_self": true}
