They are about to crush earnings go long 79.5c 5/29\n\n# Summary\n\nDollar Tree (DLTR) is about to have a fantastic earnings report 5/28 and this will break down why. If you are interested in the fine details, keep reading. Otherwise refer to the TL;DR above.\n\n# Demand\n\nDollar Tree, just like Dollar General, is a chain discount store with most of their products selling for somewhere near $1.00. Basically, they are like a Target for broke people; a group that has spiked since jobs were furloughed. Demand for these products has skyrocketed since COVID hit, simply read for yourselves: *\"demand has been 'unprecedented' for things  like cleaning supplies, paper goods, sanitizers, food, and  over-the-counter medicine. This spike pushed sales higher by 7% in its  Dollar Tree locations and by 14% at Family Dollar as shoppers stocked up  on essentials through most of March.\"* Not to mention this was writtien at the end of March before things even got really bad. Remember, Dollar Tree also owns Family Dollar, so they have seen a dramatic increase in both fronts during this pandemic. The slight slump in easter related merchandise mentioned by the article is irrelevant as the insane demand for essentials over the months since will more than counteract the decline as Easter has an extremely short buying season, no more than a week or two.\n\n# Balance Sheet\n\nDollar Tree currently has $1.9 billion in cash on hand, giving the company large flexibility to weather this pandemic. This will largely not be needed however as through the recent demand spike they will profit greatly from the lockdown. Dollar Tree's [Short-Term Debt & Capital Lease Obligation](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/Short-Term+Debt/DLTR/Short-Term-Debt--Capital-Lease-Obligation/Dollar-Tree) for the **quarter** that ended in **Jan. 2020** was **$1,529 Mil**. Dollar Tree's [Long-Term Debt & Capital Lease Obligation](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/Long-Term+Debt/DLTR/Long-Term-Debt--Capital-Lease-Obligation/Dollar-Tree) for the **quarter** that ended in **Jan. 2020** was **$8,807 Mil**. Their debt to equity ratio is relatively high at 1.65 meaning that they have been agressive in financing growth with debt. Their aggressive expansion right before a demand surge will greatly increase profits and allow them to pay off a lot of the debt they used to expand prior to the pandemic. Historically, they have been debt-laden so this ability to pay most of it off will be recieved very positively by investors.\n\n# Technicals\n\nDLTR is currently trading at $75.07 as of Friday's close, down from 52wk ATH of 119.71 giving this plenty of room to grow. Since April the stock has been locked in a channel between 70-83 and poised for a breakout, especially considering DLTR earnings are historically very volitile. The stock recently retested lows at 72, forming a green bull hammer on the daily chart and is trading above the 200 period Hull MA which is currently at 72.26. Additionally the RSI is neutral at 48.15 and the Schaff Trend Cycle shows a new bull trend forming.\n\n# Positions\n\n78c 5/29\n\n79c 5/29\n\n79.5c 5/29\n\n80c 5/29", "created_utc": 1589662242.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gl24fo/the_case_for_dollar_tree_dollar_generals/", "is_self": true}
