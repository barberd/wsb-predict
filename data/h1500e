It's me, another fucking retard, here to tell you how you can also BRRRRRRR money like the FED.\n\nToday was redder than my ex wife 3 months into menopause, which means it's a great day to buy calls. Since we're all fucking retarded, I thought to myself \"what's the most retarded think we can do of all\" \n\nSince that's all we ever do anyway, let's look at $SPY. I looked at the GAINZ from SPY 3 months before the dirty rona and 3 months after the dirty rona. Average GAINZ on that is +$20 per month (+30 strictly after rona) \n\nIf you track that out to 1/1/2021, SPYkids 3D will have a low price of $441 and a high price of $501. 12/31 $415 spy calls are currently worth $0.23. So if you want elite monies then buy those today or tomodrows power hour sell off\n\nHere's some DD:\n\n1: Today still falls in line with a V shape recovery, and the 6 month DJI chart shows DJI @25,000 is a hard support line\n\n2: Orange man has tied his entire value to the STONK market. He needs it to he more up than my schlonger before my ex wife went into menopause if he has any hope of beating the Bi Guy\n\n3: Money go BRRRRRRRR and STONKS only go up \n\n4: I wrote a lot of words so you know I know what the fuck I'm talking about \n\n5: this idea is FUCKING RETARDED but it's the exact kind of retarded that actually makes sense \n\n6: if we're in a W recovery you'll lose all your money like a retard anyway and at least you'll have a great bar story\n\n7: GAINZ for those calls would legitimately be 7 or 8 figures depending on how many you buy and I know you degenerate shitbags want to post ur gainz porn\n\n8: volume on them is already decent for long calls which gives you a pretty easy exit strategy in case it goes tits up like the mistress I left my ex wife for\n\n------------\n\nTLDR: buy $415 SPY calls for 12/31", "created_utc": 1591900271.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h1500e/a_how_to_guide_on_brrrrrring_ur_own_money_spy/", "is_self": true}
