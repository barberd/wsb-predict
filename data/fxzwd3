{"id": "fxzwd3", "title": "J-Powell's Matrix and the Final Barometer for Credit Risk: LIBOR, the Hero We Need (Discussion, DD, and a Rant Inside)", "selftext": "Greetings my disgruntled hooligans. Today we are going to go across the pond to analyze LIBOR, one of the most important aspects of the lending market.\n\n**Daddy Powell, Going Where Even Our Princess Janet Yellen Would Never Have Gone:**\n\nThe Fed this morning announced a massive unloading of additional stimulus, and one of the most significant additions they are now including: providing liquidity to parts of the High Yield (junk) Corporate Bond Market. This is big, very big. For one, I never thought this move would occur because traditional QE has focused on agency and government backed securities. The role of liquidity being considered for IG and HY markets misconfigures market pricing of counterparty risk. Just as Janet's pristine grey hair is getting greyer because of Powell, so too am I shitting bricks. We are living in Powell's monetary simulation, his own little Matrix.\n\n**This is today's dissertation: where do we look in this market to understand real(ish) credit risk.**  \n\nLending is the foundation of economic output, and understanding the pricing behind lending, that is, properly calculating counterparty risk, is of paramount importance. For instance, your wife's boyfriend wants to borrow money to buy a Rolie despite being a savant of McDonald burger flipping - you ain't getting that money back. Your wife's boyfriend (the counterparty) carries counterparty risk (if he doesn't pay you back). Note: I am talking monetary compensation not sexual favors. Anyway, at a high level, we have historically been able to look at Investment Grade and/or High Yield option adjusted spreads (OAS) for understanding what the market is pricing in as a default risk. These spreads tell us the spread between a given rating category in relation to the respective spot treasury curve. Put in WSB lingo: It shows us the market priced default risk / credit risk within the corporate bond market relative to a related treasury security. Put even more simply: higher OAS spreads, greater risk. It serves as an adequate way for the market to express distress, concern, and future risk/volatility. Put in the purest of forms: spread go uppie, expected risk go uppie! \n\nWe saw during the March liquidity crunch OAS spreads widen substantially, and they have recently been contracting substantially. In fact, proxies for performance can be found in ETFs, particularly LQD (IG Corporates) and HYG (HY Corporates). Because of the Fed's announcement, HYG is on track for its best performance today in history. This isn't any significant breakthrough. It is the same concept in the MBS market, the Repo market, etc. Fed stimulus \"props up\" these markets by providing liquidity / access to capital that the free market normally would not provide - this suppresses yields below the theoretical free market equilibrium. Some shitfuck on CNBC even said earlier \"I may just buy what the Fed buys.\" This suppresses yields, encourages risk taking, and inflates asset prices. **My perspective: The Fed moving into the IG and HY bond market will cause bond spreads over treasuries to be an inadequate representation of market default risk as OAS are likely to decline.** \n\n**I Present LIBOR, One of the Final Places to Discover Pure(ish) Credit Risk**\n\nLIBOR, in its simplest form, is  the average interest rate select banks on the London money market are prepared to lend to each other, without collateral. It is a rough estimate of what banks would charge other banks for money. This reference rate purely considers the supply and demand balance among member banks, and serves as an adequate representation for credit risk that banks are pricing in among each other. The interesting thing about LIBOR, is that it is consistently priced very closely to the Fed Funds Rate, which the Fed cut last month to the lower bound between 0.00%-0.25%. But, the interesting thing as of late is that while the Fed Funds Rate has dropped to an effective rate of 0.05%, current 3M LIBOR is priced at 1.31%. The Fed controls the Fed Funds Rate through short-term treasury securities, so the 3M Treasury Bill is an important proxy for the Fed Funds Rate in understanding this relationship.\n\nThe historical relationship between the 3M T-bill and LIBOR 3M is displayed below. The key takeaway: LIBOR is consistently priced a few basis points above the 3M T-bill, up until a big recent divergence.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3bu7zn948ur41.png?width=968&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1c927ad4d84d7f4e7a6a237ce19259734ef6698\n\nA better way to display this relationship is the TED Spread. This displays the spread between the 3M T-Bill and 3M LIBOR:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yeeknpwd8ur41.png?width=968&format=png&auto=webp&s=79809efc66a85d3b68ce3f809c3b18e4bf45e1b1\n\nDuring the 08' Financial Crisis, LIBOR surged higher in relation to the 3M T-Bill and effective Fed Funds Rate as the risk of literal bank defaults took hold (think Bear Sterns and Lehman). What we have seen in the past month, is that the spread has widened to its greatest level since the financial crisis. \n\nLIBOR is critical for understanding the market risk considered by banks in lending markets. LIBOR is used as the index pricing base for bank loans (term loans, revolvers, you name it), as well as instrumental in pricing interest rate swaps and other derivative instruments. \n\n**Cool, So Why is this Important?**\n\nLIBOR is one of the last places to identify credit risk that is not directly influenced by the Fed. The Fed liquidity distorts nearly every aspect of fixed income markets, and **monitoring where LIBOR moves in the coming weeks is going to be critical to understanding the underbelly of bank counterparty risk.** Currently, LIBOR has been trading at a significant premium to the equivalent 3M T-Bill. This implies that the bank market is digesting significant fear, and while LIBOR has decreased very slightly over the past two weeks (nothing compared to the IG / HY OAS), the movement has been slim, and higher than normal credit risk is still priced in. \n\n**tl;dr - The Fed is causing typical proxies for credit market distress to be hidden because of added liquidity, and LIBOR is one of the few representations of market lending rates that the Fed cannot directly influence. The divergence between the 3M T-Bill and 3M LIBOR is very indicative of continued distress in the lending markets despite Fed's intervention.** \n\nBelow is additional reading:\n\nLIBOR Forward Curve:\n\n[LIBOR Forward Curve \\(Chatham Financial\\)](https://preview.redd.it/lfvx0oo2eur41.png?width=809&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac42394e0403fa2b31c876156bb1e80b1ae7d10a)\n\nThe LIBOR forward curve is the market's projection of future LIBOR expectations using Eurodollar futures and Swap data. The LIBOR curve is instrumental in pricing of interest rate swaps, but we are not going to go down that rabbit hole today.\n\nThe market's forward curve is currently anticipating a return to the relationship between the 3M T-Bill and 3M LIBOR around Q3/Q4 of 2020. That is, according to Fed Fund Futures, the market does not anticipate any rate hikes for the next year or two, but the market does anticipate that LIBOR will recede back to the traditional basis point spread. This is important because the futures market is saying they anticipate the current lending risks among banks are expected to relinquish later this year. This makes sense: if COVID goes away over the summer, economies reopen, and demand improves. Now, my challenge to you: Do you think that is adequate? Do you think that the market will be much better off and face less credit risk in 3-4 months from now? Reflect on that, and I will be following what LIBOR does closely moving forward, and I will keep you all updated.\n\nMy Rant:\n\nMy $0.02 - The Fed moving into non-agency/government securities represents a critical shift in modern monetary policy. The brrr machine will never stop pumping when shit hits the fan. This is going to kick deficit spending and the issue of inflated asset prices down the road until Fed power becomes obsolete. Pricing in \"credit risk\" is becoming more and more of a joke because what's the point of pricing in default risk if you're guaranteed a bailout or liquidity to access further capital? Let the business failures fail. It has better long-term economic benefits than propping up failing businesses. Sorry, I just needed to rant. \n\nSPY 6/30p\n\nAs always, discuss, challenge, and ask questions !\n\n- \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc36", "created_utc": 1586463748.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxzwd3/jpowells_matrix_and_the_final_barometer_for/", "is_self": true}
