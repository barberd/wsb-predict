Request a due diligence report here!", "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI have been working on adding a new section, \"Due Diligence\", to my site. I have come across some autistic college students looking to make a few extra bucks by providing me an in-depth research report on tickers (I give them guidelines and they do some gritty work). I recently released a full report on ATVI (Activision Blizzard) and will release our 2nd edition on Disney this upcoming Sunday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically, I would to give my college friends (not really friends because I bought them, kind of like when you pay a hooker to hang out with you and tell you you're handsome) the opportunity to continue learning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**If you have any \"Due Diligence\" requests that you would like a report on. Post the ticker here.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**OR**\n\nGo to [this link for SwaggyStocks](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocks/due-diligence) and add your ticker to the \"Request Ticker\" box and it will automatically log it. If you have multiple tickers, feel free to enter as many as you'd like.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you friends.", "created_utc": 1572469894, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpcxoz/offering_full_research_reports_on_any_stock/", "is_self": true}
