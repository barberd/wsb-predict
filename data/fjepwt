{"id": "fjepwt", "title": "Bloody Monday (today) TA", "selftext": "Let Monday Run Blood Red: TA\n\nFollowing Trump's speech, i was for the first time scared. Yesterday had me in shambles. Did we hit rock bottom, and  are us bears absolutely fucked? Am i really gay?\n\nTrump constantly displays this notion to the public of that he is able to save the economy. I mean with a snap of his finger the whole market went up yesterday, and my SPXS calls got shit on. I'm not as aware of my autistity as others in this page are, but I know that everyone likes to make money. And when trump did this, i didnt get money, I actually lost it.\n\nFor the first time since this recession, I thought put holders were about to get their asshole drilled in hard by hughmuculus Donny cock,\n\nBut then I saw this....\n\nhttps://m.imgur.com/a/5cUyyEb\n\nI can practically hear every dumb shit in this subreddit. OH this doesn't make sense I don't get it Im confused\n\nListen, you're beneath me. \n\nAnyways this quick sketch does indicate some principle indicators in the current AND future spy trends. Notice the arrows. There are several indicators hinting towards a deep recession for S&P 500. First of all, there are four red arrows and three green arrows. Each arrow is carefully measured to proportionally represent the slope of the downfall of each spike. \n\nNow listen again, This may mean absolutely nothing to you, but this is a strong Indicator of a bearish market. I repeat, the slopes of each bearish spike are represented here with the red arrows, and the slopes of each bullish spike are represented rightfully with the green arrows. \n\nThe first two red arrows are followed with two green arrows. \n\nThe next two arrows are followed with one green arrow.\n\nThe next projected move at this rate can be calculated with y = 3-x.  X represents each set of two red arrows as Y represents how many green arrows there are with each set of two red arrows. Notice that once there are three sets of red arrows, (which this is the trend) there will be no more green arrows. \n\nY will EQUAL 0. \n\nif you look closely, you'll see above that this graph supports this.\n\nYour spy puts are safe, and so is the amount of sleep you get this weekend. Monday will run Bloody Red, and theres nothing the feds and lord trump can do about it. A recessions a recession.\n\nTLDR: thorough TA says buy spy puts\n\nalso gtfo if you didn't read it, hurt my feelings", "created_utc": 1584331161.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjepwt/bloody_monday_today_ta/", "is_self": true}
