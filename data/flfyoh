I was also on 4chan\ud83c\udf40 when that guy raped the catacombs and the exploding condom happened, similarities between WSB and \ud83c\udf40 definitely exist. Anyways, I would see your positions like 4/20 TSLA $420C & 05/25 SPY 0 and think it was some crazy financial language for rich bastards \ud83d\ude02.\n\nI wanted to learn this said language and make mega [fuck](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckyoumoney/) [you](https://youtu.be/xdfeXqHFmPI) money. So I spent many months on Investopedia, taking pages of notes, rewatching the Big Short \ud83d\udcc9, learning economic theory, stats, programming and TA until all of the knowledge was mine.\n\nFast forward to today, I lost a lot of money that I really needed. I was sad \ud83e\udd22\ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude2d and wanted to throw up at first. Being slightly devastated I had to mentally slap myself in the face. No one said this would be easy, no one promised a land of tendies \ud83c\udf57\ud83d\udcb8 and vaccines \ud83d\udc89 to all who entered and if you don\u2019t risk big then can you really win big? The market is often like a playing a game of wack-a-mole with darts.\n\nI\u2019m going to watch 300, The Wolf of Wall Street and maybe musical in between so I get break out my dance moves then think about what a silly fool I\u2019ve been. I\u2019ll post the gainzzzz...today, in 10 minutes or whenever BUT I WILL BE BACK \ud83e\udd16.\n\nIf I don\u2019t make $12,345 by 01/31/2021, I will get the old WSB logo tattooed on my butt.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nTLDR; I went full retard and lost bill money. I was sad but it\u2019s my fault I lost it and it will also be my fault when I make all the gains in the world.\nLong Live America? 01/21/21 VIX 82P", "created_utc": 1584645778.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flfyoh/i_lost_it_alli_want_to_throw_up_but_i_cant_stop_i/", "is_self": true}
