{"id": "gnz3qf", "title": "CALLS ON NVIDIA???", "selftext": "My very well proven technical analysis puts NVIDIA at another all time high of around $365-$366 per share on Monday after tonight\u2019s earnings. Yes I know, a whole lot of you think it\u2019s too overvalued, but know that we aren\u2019t in normal times. A lot of bears argument is that, NVDAs rally has already been priced in, so it\u2019s earnings no matter how good somehow would expose its overvaluation. This as reasonable as it may sound is wrong according to historical data. There would be enough time to buy puts on NVDA in the long run, but trust me, today isn\u2019t it.", "created_utc": 1590075493.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gnz3qf/calls_on_nvidia/", "is_self": true}
