{"id": "fq4s5v", "title": "[DD] RIFs (Layoffs) Incoming. We've only seen the tip of the iceberg", "selftext": "I work at a large VC/PE fund--one of the largest in the US--on the investing team. This absolutely does not make me a public markets expert AT ALL. That said...\n\nJust talked to our firm's talent partner. Her job is to help all of our portfolio companies with sourcing top exec talent, designing hiring plans, etc. Lately, all of her conversations with portcos have been about RIFs (layoffs). I asked her the following three questions: \n\n1. What % of our companies are talking about layoffs? Answer: 65%\n2. What % of those companies have actually executed on any layoffs? Answer: 10%\n3. Do you expect the other 90% to actually go through with the layoffs and if yes when? Answer: yes, almost all of them. Most next week \n\nCounterintuitively, the stimulus bill that was passed today may actually cause a spike in layoffs next week. This is because in order to get the government loan forgiven (aka free money), you are not allowed to layoff more than 25% of headcount \\*from the time you get the loan\\* (and if you do a layoff after you get the loan but it's <25% of your FTEs, you can only get part of the debt forgiven). So, companies are actually scrambling to get their RIFs done before they file for the loans and get in line for their free $$$. \n\nTL;DR - big layoffs coming next week. 3.3M was only the tip of the iceberg.\n\nEdit: SPY 260P 5/1. Plus a bunch of other single names that I think are screwed.
