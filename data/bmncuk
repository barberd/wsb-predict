{"id": "bmncuk", "title": "Settlement Announcement - DGLY", "selftext": "Digital Ally Inc has reached a settlement with Watchguard Inc in regards to patent infringement around the auto-activation of police body cams.   This came out in court filings on 4/30 (see spike in volume on that day) but has not been in the news.  \n\nOnce the news goes public (which is due May 13th at latest but could be today or tomorrow), I anticipate DGLY will spike hard due to its low float.\n\nThen, over the new few days, many Axon Inc shareholders (AAXN) will start grabbing up DGLY shares to hedge against losing their own lawsuit with DGLY over the same technology.  That lawsuit is probably going to Jury Trial later this year unless AAXN also settles.   That suit is seeking $204 million due to treble damages.  \n\nGrab DGLY shares while you can, I'm loaded up with 30,000.", "created_utc": 1557426633, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bmncuk/settlement_announcement_dgly/", "is_self": true}
