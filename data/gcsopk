{"id": "gcsopk", "title": "Traded Every Bear Market Since 935 AD, Here's What Happens Next", "selftext": "Boy, the parchment bear market during the Mongolian Sack of Baghdad was a doozy. I've seen them all, so let me tell you what will happen next. Before I do, though, I need to scold you a little bit first. I tried engaging with you tards [once before](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjlaby/20002008_trading_veteran_here_this_is_what/), but you were so goddamn mean and ungrateful that I've decided to come back and try again because I'm a glutton for misery just like the rest of you.\n\nNow, what I had tried to do in my previous post was to *entertain* you a little bit, and to also actually warn you about an incoming bear market rally, the likes of which we haven't seen since we, uh, last saw one, um, like it. But *noooooo*, you ungrateful little Beliebers voted up a comment that said there was literally nothing of value in that post, and then I had, tbh, a little satisfaction watching many of you stare in disbelief at The Giant Green Dildo of a 5-week rally rising up out the grave that was March. Ermagerd, someone in that last post even scoffed at the idea of a big rally by quipping: \"Where were you Friday?\" lolololol As if that little into-the-close-short-covering on the 13th was what I had in mind. Nah, son, I meant *a* *rally*. (Here, hold on, lol, Textedit in MacOS isn't marking \"ermagerd\" as a typo, lol it's actually in the dictionary.)\n\nAt any rate, I've come back now, having now just dusted off my useless humanities degree to try to bring you a little more entertainment, if any of you savages are capable of so being entertained by some colorful language. I'll add swear words and some porn this time, deal? (*Haha no I won't, automod thinks my first draft was uncivil*.) I might even get around to telling you [what you can expect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUgwJukcBG4) in the coming weeks. Or I might just be *messing* (*guess what word that was in the first draft lol*) with you and will delight in having gotten you to read like a lot of words and stuff for nothing.\n\nNow I know all the bears are butthurt right now, but that's exactly what a bear market really has to do in order to come to an end. And yah, I think we're basically there. So bears, get unbutthurt. You guys f-- *bruised* yourselves because you were too impatient and thought the market could go to zero in a straight line. It also doesn't help that half of you were carefully nurtured in safe spaces while our generation was raised under the angry, disapproving stares of unforgiving parents who made everything smell like cigarettes. Now, if the bulls brainwashed you into thinking all time highs lol are possible despite what you're reading about the real economy, you need to fix that sh-- *stuff* in a hurry. We actually might be going to zero, but god-- *gollydarnits* not in a straight line.\n\nI'd give you guys some TA and Elliott Wave targets, but [Jesus H. Christ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-Ra1-_iHcA) you guys don't like crayons. What we're entering is a Wave 3, which is the biggest wave in magnitude. It will be composed of five waves itself (down, up, big, big oh-my-god down \\[3rd of 3rd\\], up, then down). It doesn't have to be the fastest, but it will be the longest, greatest in magnitude. Likely targets are as such: first wave down will get us around the March lows, then a rally (people will be saying, \"See! It's a double-bottom!! We retested the lows!\" lol, um no, not really, not at all). It *will be a rally*, yes, but not as big as the one we just had, not some five week crap. How long? I have no idea. Then the big oh-my-god moment, the wave 3 of 3. It, too will be composed of a 5-wave structure, but will land us around the 2007 highs, god knows where exactly, S&P 500 1500-1700? Then we'll stop, people will say, \"There, *that's* the real bottom,\" and we'll have a long rally, I expect. I don't expect it to rise as high as this rally did, but it very well could last *longer* *in time*. That's the typical nature of a 4th wave. That will then peter out and we'll head to new and final lows. But this is a long time away: fall? Next winter? Hard to know from here. If you're not horrible to me, I'll come back later. (Or lol if I'm totally f-- *flipping* wrong I'll not.)\n\nNow, be patient with this market and you will have much fun. It stuns me how impatient some of you can be, but this is a good experience for you. Getting burned will make you patient, and before you know it, you'll be coaching younger, more retarded traders in the next bear market (like maybe 300 years from now after what remains of human life rises from the ashes of a total kinetic nuclear war that threatens over the horizon as the Boomers desperately try to preserve the US dollar's status as the world reserve currency). Too dark? Yeah, probably.\n\nI think my generation is also necessarily more patient because our access to pornography involved trying to obtain grainy photos of Cindy Crawford over dial-up for display on 16-color monitors. Jesus, that took *forever*. You guys can conquer the entire realm of Skyrim in like what, a month? Masters of an entire realm so quickly? You should have been there for AOL, it really was just awful.\n\nTake profits along the way, and Lord Have Mercy, while you're f-- *shaking hands politely* *with* this bull, she will buck those horns. The Boomers *will* try to save this. That will be those two rallies. I do not know what they will do to try to save it, but they will absolutely try to. QE Eternal Divine Quantum something, I don't know.\n\n*Do not be shocked if they shut the markets down*. This is going to f-- *upset* them ~~up~~. Now, if you're g-- *not straight* and selling premium, you'll be fine, but if you have short-dated puts, you're all f-- *tussled* up bad. Not a bad idea to try both (some puts and some bear call spreads). If they do shut it off, I don't expect it will be for more than a week. They will have to let people out, who want out, even at any price, eventually.\n\nI'm retarded too so I could also be wrong about all of this. I'm not a g-- *goldarmied* fortune teller or I wouldn't be here with you, but:\n\nTLDR; If we crash hard, I'll be grateful if the mods would flair me with something funny like \"Ok Doomer\" ", "created_utc": 1588520572.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gcsopk/traded_every_bear_market_since_935_ad_heres_what/", "is_self": true}
