{"id": "bjdopg", "title": "Please do not judge...", "selftext": "So I\u2019ve been studying a little bit about options for the past few months and decided I would get my feet a little wet. I realize these might not work out, but some of them actually have and I\u2019ve made some money on other types of calls. I decided to throw down only like $50 on some VTR calls at 65 strike. I noticed there is a lot of open interest there so I didn\u2019t think I was going to fail. I was like okay, it\u2019s only $50, who cares if I lose it. We all love losing money here, right? I bought sometime last week thinking they would go up because the stock obviously would. Thanks Bernie! Unfortunately while the stock price has come up a lot, the option hasn\u2019t really moved because it\u2019s so \u201cilliquid\u201d I guess... For future reference I was wondering If I should just stay away from these type of plays. I\u2019m just trying to learn the ropes as best as I can on these lesser known type of plays, because I\u2019m poor as fuck. If I\u2019m too autistic, please go easy on me.", "created_utc": 1556689372, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bjdopg/please_do_not_judge/", "is_self": true}
