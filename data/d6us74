I follow this company religiously. I'm a part of the exclusive Nio Shareholders association on Facebook, and get the inside details. \n\n**TLDR: Buy Puts**\n\nHere are my reasons\n\n1) Nio is reporting Q2 earnings just 6 days before their Q3 ends! Normally companies need to report earnings within 45 days of the quarter ending, Nio is long past 45 days. Delaying earnings is never a good sign of confidence. \n\n2) Excerpt from Q1 conference call, high cash burn, possibly higher then Q1. Wallstreet loves to crash a stock with cash burn.  \n\nQuestion:  What is the outlook for the cash burn in future quarters? \n\n**Louis Hsieh** \\-- *Chief Financial Officer*\n\nHey, Dan, it's Louis. We expect Q2 cash burn to be a little bit high, but then Q3 and Q4, once ES6 starts delivery, we expect the cash burn to come down relatively quickly.\n\n3) Low delivers for the Q2 3,553, based off an average sale price of $57,357 per car I'm guessing $204 million in revenue with -7% gross margins. Leaving a 14 million loss on the books.\n\n4) Nio didn't start layoff or cost cutting until Q3.\n\n5) Analysis option chains, the market is expecting up to a $1 shit in price. $2.5 &gt; $3.5 range.\n\n6) If your still reading this there has been a buy order sitting at $2.35 for over 100k shares, so don't buy puts below $2.5. This market maker will pump this stock up, and it will not break $2.35. \n\n7)  2/3rds of the Nio Shareholders association group think that this stock is going to moon, so inverse them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Stock Price|Votes|\n|:-|:-|\n|$3 - $3.5|21 votes|\n|\\&gt; $3.5|16 votes|\n|$2.5-$3|11 votes|\n|&lt; $2.5|2 votes|", "created_utc": 1568985456, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d6us74/nio_q2_earning_dd_924/", "is_self": true}
