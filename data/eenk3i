Stay with me, bois. \n\nIt\u2019s important that we rally the autistic powers of this sub to secure a \u201c.69\u201d position at market close. Then we can all spend Christmas staring at the beauty we've created. It should make enduring our fake disfuncional families a lot more *bear*able, no pun intended. Once we get back from overeating and hiding our true YTD returns on the RH chart from marginally interested family members, we go ALL IN on *696.69 CALLS* expiring June 9th.\n\nIf you\u2019ve got bear fleas itching at your armpits it\u2019s because there's solid DD behind this that you\u2019re not seeing here. **Numbers ending in .69 assume a quantum superposition that is both belly up AND belly down at the same time.** This is physics you damn retards!
