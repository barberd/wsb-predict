{"id": "eg0p2g", "title": "How I ignored the greatest DD I had ever been given", "selftext": "TLDR: I ignored some better-than-insider-trading-level DD and missed out on 10x gains.\n\nSo be me back in high school virgin autist like so many others here. Get GF and finally bus that fatty nut, like the horny teenagers we were we quickly started fucking like rabbits. Always go to her house and watch movies on tv while the deed gets done. What platform are we watching these movies on you ask a Roku.\n\nThis went on for the last 2 years of highschool into college and every time we would watch ROKU. I think from now all I'll call it BROKU since it did help me in the most BRO way ever. BROKU turned this virgin autist into a regular autist. Little did I know BROKU was about to show me an even bigger bro move. \n\nSeptember 2017 ROKU goes public price is around $14 per share. I had been trading since late 2015, stocks only didn't know or care about options since no reddit meant no WSB. I saw the news headline and thought about adding that to my \"portfolio\" but decided against it. I had just gotten Netflix for myself about a year prior after leeching of a friends. \n\nBack then I worked as a C level mechanic and took home around 300 a week. Had I just taken 1 paycheck and bought roughly 20 shares I could have turned that into ~3K. The moral of the story is when you have the best DD in the world don't ignore it, go all in 100% that portfolio, spend money to make money, all those other bullshit saying.
