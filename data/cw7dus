{"id": "cw7dus", "title": "Afternoon Briefing (8/27/2019)", "selftext": "# Midday Summary: Stocks down near session lows as Treasury yields continue to decline\n\nThe stock market trades down near session lows after it began the session in a broad-based advance. The early gains have faltered alongside a noticeable decline in U.S. Treasury yields, leaving the S&amp;P 500 (-0.4%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.5%), and Nasdaq Composite (-0.5%) down around 0.5%. The Russell 2000 is down 1.2%.\u00a0\n\nThere wasn't any specific news driver for today's higher start, but some follow-through buying, or end-of-the-month repositioning, may have contributed to the positive bias. Some pointed to trade-related hope, but there was little to suggest the market would continue to rally on trade while China continued to deny yesterday's presumed news catalyst.\n\nStrikingly, safe-haven assets like gold ($1552.40, +15.20, +1.0%) and U.S. Treasuries held firm leading up to the higher start and have since seen increased demand amid the retreat in equities. The move in the Treasury market has had a noticeable effect on the S&amp;P 500 financials sector (-1.0%) as the yield curve continues to see flattening/inversion activity.\n\nSpecifically, the 2s10s spread inversion has widened to four basis points, largely due to a seven-basis-point drop in the 10-yr yield (1.48%). The 3mo-10yr spread, which\u00a0researchers at the San Francisco Federal Reserve found to be the most reliable of the different term spreads as a recession indicator, is inverted by 51 basis points. That spread has been inverted since May.\n\nAmong the lone bright spots in the market include the defensive-oriented real estate (+0.2%) and utilities (+0.4%) sectors, which also tend to benefit from lower yields.\u00a0\n\nDow component\u00a0**Johnson &amp; Johnson** (**JNJ** 130.52, +2.72, +2.1%) also trades higher, although the reason for its outperformance isn't something to gloat about. JNJ was found liable in an Oklahoma court for its part in the opioid crisis and is being ordered to pay $572 million, which was at the low end of expectations and much less than the $17 billion the state wanted.\n\nIn M&amp;A news, tobacco companies\u00a0**Philip Morris International** (**PM** 72.43, -5.28, -6.7%) and **Altria Group** (**MO** 45.85, -1.27, -2.3%) have been in talks to merge. MO initially jumped about 10% on news that it would be an all-stock merger of equals, but shares have turned negative on reports that a merger might give Altria Group just 41% of the company with no premium.\n\nReviewing today's economic data, which included the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for August, the FHFA Housing Price Index for June, and the S&amp;P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for June:\n\n* The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for August printed at 135.1 (Briefing.com consensus 129.6) versus an upwardly revised 135.8 (from 135.7) in July, which was the third highest reading since October 2000.\n   * The key takeaway from the report is that it reflects a pretty solid state of consumer confidence, which is a supportive foundation for continued discretionary spending. That matters greatly for an economy driven predominantly by consumer spending.\n* The FHFA Housing Price Index for June increased 0.2% following a revised 0.2% increase in May (from 0.1%).\n* The S&amp;P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for June increased 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus of 2.7%) following a 2.4% increase in May.", "created_utc": 1566925795, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cw7dus/afternoon_briefing_8272019/", "is_self": true}
