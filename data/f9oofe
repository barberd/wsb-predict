The [booze fest has spread to Italy](https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/25/europe/italy-coronavirus-backfoot-intl/index.html) and it may bring down the shittiest Jenga tower in the world that is the Italian Banking system. Italian government [debt to GDP is well over 100%](https://tradingeconomics.com/italy/government-debt-to-gdp), [Private debt to GDP is around 160%](https://tradingeconomics.com/italy/private-debt-to-gdp), and growth for this year is expected at [a whopping 0.5%](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2020/01/29/Italy-Staff-Concluding-Statement-of-the-2019-Article-IV-Mission). They Italian government is loving the low interest rates right now because they're all the way down to [a BBB bond rating](https://www.ft.com/content/91224852-bad9-11e9-96bd-8e884d3ea203) with some agencies holding an \"negative\" outlook towards future public bond prospects because of the government's inability to form, nevertheless decide anything (can you say \"credit risk\" backwards three times fast?).\n\nNow, you may say that Italy isn't actually in all that bad of shape because Italy has actually done a great job of [reducing its non-performing loans](https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/italy/non-performing-loans-ratio) over the last few years (they're down to just over 8% now from literally every single loan!
