As a reasonable investor with a well balanced, 30% CRSPR portfolio I am feeling pretty smug right now.

Get in here.\n\nThis is my current shares only portfolio:\n\n30% Tesla\n\n30% Crispr Stocks\n\n30% China meme stocks\n\n10% random stocks\n\nNow if the trade war with china is resolved I hope to see some gains on my heavy IQ and UXIN bags too.", "created_utc": 1574199780, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dyrcvm/where_my_crspr_chads_at/", "is_self": true}
