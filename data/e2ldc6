I realized BABA was gonna be a great buy due to the good news yesterday and tried to buy it when it was down a little... I had to go out for what was supposed to only be a short errand and home by 3pm so still one hour till close, got home 5 minutes till close and saw my order never got filled. Tried so quickly to get a market order in and missed it by milliseconds\n\nWould have been up 1000% if I sold at its peak today :( all the strike prices up to $210 as far as a month out, are up more than 150% right now\n\nThink its dumb to FOMO into it? Been watching this bitch grow for a month\n\nAt least I got some ARWR tendies, but, sold those too earlier like a true fucking autist as well\n\nI think I am gonna be gay and stick my money into SPY and other funds, dollar cost averaging by buying shares each month and only do a YOLO once in awhile. This options shit is stressful. Even when I make money, if I see I could have made more had I just held it for 30 minutes longer I feel so stupid lol\n\nAny advice on taking the emotion out of trading?", "created_utc": 1574883246, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e2ldc6/anyone_get_in_on_the_baba_calls/", "is_self": true}
