Beyond the mechanistic side of negative pricing there\u2019s also market reality: the world\u2019s storage sites are\u00a0filling\u00a0with crude fast -- the precise concern that caused West Texas Intermediate to turn negative.\n\n\u201cIn the North Sea, the ships operate as a pipeline, so are there enough vessels to enable the flow of oil?\u201d said Jorge Montepeque, president of\u00a0General Index\u00a0and the man who helped shape the way oil prices are assessed globally when he was a boss at S&P Global Platts. \u201cIf there isn\u2019t, you will need to pay ever increasing prices for the ships, which results in a lower and lower price of the oil.\u201d\n\nThat pressure on the tanker fleet is building right now. Well over\u00a0100 million barrels of oil is now being held in floating storage -- by another estimate more than\u00a0twice that. According to Belgian vessel owner Euronav NV, one of the world\u2019s largest, the dynamic is driving freight rates ever higher -- a trend the firm\u00a0doesn\u2019t see reversing any time soon.\n\nPlaces to keep supplies are diminishing globally. With on-land sites either completely booked up or filling fast, there\u2019s still pressure on Brent, even if it\u2019s more dispersed than for WTI. Barrels may keep flowing for longer than they should, too, because stopping and starting wells is no easy task.\n\n\u201cIf there is a technical reason why you cannot shut in the well, then the oil production that you have to sell will have to clear in the market, which can be a negative price,\u201d Montepeque said.\n\nThere\u2019s another important difference between the two contracts. While the Brent futures contract is cash settled against the value of the Brent index price, the WTI contract is physically settled, meaning a trader must take delivery of barrels of oil at Cushing in Oklahoma, hundreds of miles from the coast.\n\nWhile this means that WTI can become pressured if there\u2019s perceived strain on storage at the U.S. hub, there\u2019s also a fast-building glut in the rest of the world.\n\nSo Brent can, in theory at least, go negative. The real question is whether production will be scaled back sufficiently before that possibility becomes a probability\"", "created_utc": 1587570511.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g63jiq/bloomberg_brent_can_go_negative_as_well/", "is_self": true}
