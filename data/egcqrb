Without a doubt. \n\n$LULU says \u201cI\u2019m active, and am in a higher social class than you\u201d. $PTON says \u201cI\u2019m so wealthy that not only can I afford the peloton,  I\u2019m so not concerned with money that I bought the merch as well. Positive they\u2019re already taking that cue from Tesla. \n\nFinal thoughts on the stock.
