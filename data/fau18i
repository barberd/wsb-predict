Recently converted gay near cuz, yknow gonna try and make this short without boring you ppl with 3 seconds of attention span.\nI know we usually don't partake in futures options but this is too good not to share.\nCurrently there are few assets considered a safe haven that do well in times like these (bitcoin if you're a bag holding millennial, gold if you're a fucking dinosaur that still consider gold \"safe\" money in a time of unlimited digital stocks and bonds and currencies and etc.) Well there's still something that people out wholehearted faith in and that is government bonds.\nBut only certain governments deserve this special treatment mind you. USA, Japan, and Germany (I'm probably missing a few but who cares). The 10Y German Bunds (cuz they call it bUnds there for whatever Nazi reason) are currently at historical lows and reflecting mass panic. Part of it is also bc ECB just got done with the tenure of super mario dragging (he's called that because wall street loves him for bailing out bankrupt Europe not too long ago, nevermind Mario is just a racist caricature of what Japanese people think about Italians but that's another story entirely) who'd lowered rates to unprecedented neg 40pct. I feel all this could change pretty quickly if we're getting the debt blowup and deleveraging sell off were getting yada yada and bar shit virus in Germany and japan too. Plus unlike Fed, the ECB cannot lower rates still and Christine Legarde seems like a classy woman that would never be as batshit crazy as super Mario to keep lowering rates (Google her reluctance)\nANyway! Long story short:\nECB will lose control without an economy when everybody there died of batshit virus. Puts! Ticker for IB traders is GBL. IV is only like 6% cuz it's bonds. Jun 20s costs only a quarter. I'm going to slowly leg into the trade but this could be a fantastic blowup when the likes of safe haven sovereigns and up just like the triple aaa Mortage backed shit in the 08 blowup.\nYou're welcome.", "created_utc": 1582893233, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fau18i/puts_on_german_10y_bund_futures/", "is_self": true}
