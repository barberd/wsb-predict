This is among the lowest levels of put buying seen during the last two years, indicating extreme greed on the part of investors.\n\nLast changed Apr 8 from a Greed rating\n\nUpdated Apr 9 at 4:00pm\"\n\n[http://www.opricot.com/ticker/spy/optiongraphs](http://www.opricot.com/ticker/spy/optiongraphs)\n\nOption graphs is showing a high put/call ratio for short term expiration though. So tons of peeps bought and are bagholding (or using puts for hedging) from weeks ago but in last 5 days, everyone rushed to buy calls.\n\nLooking at future max pain points, assuming MM (flush with Fed brrr) can successfully manipulate markets to minimize MM losses/option payouts and assuming MM hates bulls and bears equally, we're going down first half of next week to wipe max FD calls, then swinging sharply up for monthly 4/17 expiration to wipe out the puts before swinging back down again.\n\nMax pain - Keep in mind volumes are higher on Monthly vs Weeklies vs Daily's so MM will be more motivated to manipulate SPY on the higher volume option expiration days.\n\nApr 13 - 265 (daily expiration)\n\nApr 15 - 261\n\nApr 17 - 275 (monthly expiration)\n\nApr 20 - 258\n\nApr 22 - 254\n\nApr 24 - 260 (weekly expiration)\n\nApr 27 - 260\n\nApr 29 - 258\n\nMay 1 - 262 (weekly expiration)\n\nMay 8 - 261 (weekly expiration)\n\nMay 15 - 276 (monthly expiration)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Based on option max pain and greedy call buyers last 5 trading days, MM will push SPY down early/mid next week, then pump hard for 4/17 max pain before pushing or letting market fall down again after 4/17. \n\nTLDR of TLDR: I'm wishing really hard for a black swan over next 7 days to ruin MM's day and allow Puts to print after a week from hell for putholders!", "created_utc": 1586499795.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fya0f7/options_volume_and_max_pain_to_support_next_red/", "is_self": true}
