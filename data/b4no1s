These are the picks I'm watching this week and plan on making plays into. Trade at your own risk. When I use the term YOLO play, it doesn't necessarily mean FD's, because some tickers are light on option chains. It just means put it in, and hold until you're +500% or more, or take the market in the ass and out of the trades listed, probably has the most upside percentage gain potential.\n\n**First time note to mods:** I don't know to mark this as DD or Discussion, so I picked DD, since it kind of feels like it, but maybe not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFellow WSBers, I've decided to create more discussion across specific picks and hopefully offer a bit of insight into how to pick specific plays/create entries and exits, and help us all make a bit of cash. I give a variety of plays for each stock for you to research on your own further before torching your money. I mostly trade on market sentiment and momentum and the market isn't always logical. This is from my own list each week.\n\n# How The Picks Are Generated\n\nThese stocks are found using my own scanner criteria across a variety of metrics depending on market conditions. Picks are generated from that scan. A few of the criteria:\n\n* Market cap of $5B+\n* Daily volume of 1M+\n* $10 mark and higher\n* Max PE of 25\n* Volume, volume differential, RSI, 52 week low's and high's, ToS sizzle, and a few others decide what comes out of the scan, then selected as a pick based on current market conditions/sentiment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Picks for Week of March 25th, 2019\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Lennar (LEN) - BULLISH*** \\- With the housing data that just came out being so positive for existing homes, in the interim to their earnings on 3/27 before market, there's room for Lennar to run up even though they're a builder. You have a chance to capture IV gains, or hold through earnings if you have the balls. Interest rates having been low means people were likely building and buying all homes, in fact, I have three friends who I didn't even know could afford a house build, and my parents also, in the last six months. They build piles of houses in my area, in fact just started a new development with 100+ houses after finishing one with 125. They're a huge player, off their 52W highs by quite a bit, and with interest rates low, buying should be increasing.\n\n* **Short term: 4/18 $50 calls @ $1.23**\n   * Hold until before earnings, sell for IV gains on the 26th before market close.\n* **Earnings: 4/18 $52.50 calls @ $0.60 or 5/17 $55 calls at $0.54**\n   * Hold through earnings. Even if it goes against you, if you have the May calls, you have plenty of time to recover. If earnings are good, give the trade time to run and scale out slowly if you want.\n* **YOLO: 4/18 $55 calls @ $0.28, hold and pray.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Apple (AAPL) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Apple's recently received an upgrade, and is $42 off it's 52 week high. There is way more upside than downside here. People that are buying in are buying in to hold through the service announcement and hopefully realize new all time highs. I think Apple's being accumulated, we saw a $7 price movement on Thursday, some people bought at the top, and are committed to this for term now. Their event Monday will hopefully bring a pop, followed by a fomo climb. Short term target for me is around $205-208. I currently hold $230 calls with about 90 DTE still, that I bought when Apple was at $170. They're up 600%, and I refuse to scale out. I think there's still a bunch of upside.\n\n* **Short term: 4/18 $215 calls @ $0.39**\n   * Ride through the event, gauge the movement, and take gains or hope for a swing up on more accumulation. We touched $197+ the morning of the selloff, and $196.33 the day before. If the week is green, this is over $200 by end of week.\n* **Streaming Event: 3/29 $192.50 calls @ $2.88**\n   * These were way more expensive before the sell off, and with the fact I see us rebounding from that, it (maybe) literally cannot go tits up. I don't imagine massive downside after the event, there's a reason they released all that hardware without announcements or a proper event for the hardware last week. They've got more going on then people think.\n* **YOLO: 3/29 $200 calls @ $0.96**\n   * The ultimate delight, run up required, and I'd advocate just selling off at 200% max after a pump before or after the event. If you have balls of steel, hold to expiration and hope the bull run for it continues. It only needs about 1.5% gains from last weeks high and I see it being accumulated more in the coming days, so it's definitely possible we see this type jump this week.\n* **Long Swing: 6/21 $235 calls @ $0.50**\n   * Probably not riding this one out until expiration, and I'd liquidate no later than May 5th-10th or so to avoid theta ramp. That being said, there's 1,000% upside here still easily, and you have more room/time to get out with minimal losses if it starts going against you after the event.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Royal Bank of Canada (RY) -** ***BEARISH*** \\- With the (hopefully) short term inversion of the yield curve, people are going to be very bearish on all financials. RBC was one of the smallest losers on Friday, and with more room down to 52W lows than space up to their high, and with the explosion of put volume in the big money market, I'd say that most funds are betting against it for good reason. It will take time for the US curve to affect a Canadian bank, but with the state of the global market, in the short term, this is going to lose ground speculatively. I wouldn't look for a long term play here. Play the market sentiment.\n\n* **Short term: 4/18 $75 puts @ $0.75**\n   * Let it drop, and decide when to take profits. Bounce out if it gaps above 78.50, it's going to likely be a loser no matter what then with the time until expiration.\n* **ITM bearish credit spread: Buy ITM 4/18 $75 calls, Sell ITM 4/18 $70 calls @ $4.48 credit per contract**\n   * Risk to reward is 9:1 here. Max profit is around $69.95 share price on 4/17 for $4,480 on a $520 risk. Basically, you're taking advantage of the extra premium and time value on ITM calls and praying for a big move down in the next month. Profit @ $71 share price is anywhere from 1800-3100 ramping up the closer to expiration you are. You'll be paying $52 a contract in collateral to open this spread. If you go with it - DO NOT LEG INTO IT. Open the position as a spread in whatever platform, and make sure you MAINTAIN YOUR LONG LEG. IF you get assigned early, your loss is capped at $52 a contract, but you can possibly liquidate those long legs and make more if it drops. You should not get assigned early here, simply giving information on how to play these. To reach max profit, you have to hold until expiration. Your breakeven at expiration is $74.49 on this exact trade at the numbers given. Anything below that will net you the exact amount below. Ex: $73.49 x 100 contracts = $1k.***WARNING:*** If your $75 long leg is out of the money near expiration and the short leg is ITM still, IE: share price anywhere between $70 and $75, **BE FUCKING SURE TO LIQUIDATE THURSDAY, OR FRIDAY MORNING BEFORE EXPIRATION.** There is **PIN RISK HERE. If you do not know what PIN RISK IS, DO NOT DO THIS TRADE.** Pin risk is basically getting pinned on a credit spread with no stop loss long leg as it expires, and then having the shares shift against your position once the short leg is assigned to you. This means your max loss has uncapped, and you can get fucked. You've been warned.\n* **YOLO: 4/18 $70 puts @ $0.10**\n   * If it tanks, you make bank. Simple.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Twitter (TWTR) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Not a lot to be said here. Volumes up, people seem to be accumulating. Twitter's site usage is going to increase exponentially ramping to the presidential election and campaign trail. Call volume is up. I'd just make a directional bet based on momentum solely on those factors. 50% share price upside to the 52 high. If you know how, watch the RSI and if it gets above 71-72, look for an exit. If it gets accumulated too fast and your'e short term, people will profit take on this before more accumulating happens.\n\n* **Short term: 4/18 $36 calls @ $0.44**\n   * Look to exit these before expiration unless they spike into the money. I'd estimate at 150-250% gains. Pure momentum play/demand play.\n* **Long term: 6/21 $41 calls @ $0.76**\n   * You get more time here to decide what to do. If it ramps up hard to $38-$40 share price in the next 30 days, you can lock in a nice profit, cash some out and let some ride, or let them all ride longer. I'd be exiting this no later than May 10th if they don't look like they're making it to the strike.\n* **YOLO: 3/29 $33.5 calls @ $0.60**\n   * These are sitting around a .40 delta, .19 gamma, which is pretty good with a .06 theta. You only need about $0.15 of stock price gains per day to offset the theta. If it gaps way up, you've got a choice to make whether to watch it run or profit take. Anywhere from 50% to 1,000% is possible here depending what happens with the wider market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Stocks That Could Be Worth A Look\n\n**Bullish:** Eversource Energy (ES), XCEL Energey (XEL), Kellogg (K), Hershey Company (HSY), Travelers (TRV), McDonalds (MCD), Verizon (VZ), Fidelity (FNF), Best Buy (BBY)\n\n**Bearish:** Smucker (SJM), Philip Morris (PM), Pepsi (PEP), Waste Management (WM), AES Corp (AES), McCormick (MKC), Yum China (YUMC), Sysco (SYY, after dividend), Mondelez (MDLZ)\n\n# State of the Market\n\nEverybody's worried about a big pullback. I'm not, at the current moment. A recession will come with time, but I don't think it's this week and I think last week's action was purely profit taking by institutions and algorithms. They've found exits and gotten back out of positions many were stuck in for months, remember: Some people buy shares and not options. We saw mid day consolidation on a rise, and more profit taking at the end of the day. Timing it isn't possible, so don't try to. As far as the numbers are concerned, this is still a bull market, and although I like Gundlach, he feels so perma bear that I don't know we can take his words for face value. I think he's seriously short -- and bleeding trying to pull a Dr. Burry. We gained too far too fast on Thursday after fed announcements, and people saw a chance to cash out.\n\n# Best Way To Play These Picks\n\nAt any given time if you have more than 3-4 tickers open for options and you're not a professional trader, you're probably not making correlated picks. An example is playing Apple and SPY. If Apple gains, it's more likely SPY gains that week since it's weighted towards Apple. Calls in both double dips, but can see your money evaporate also. Buying AAPL puts and SPY calls makes no sense, for the exact same rationale. Play a few of these positions, or just one, and find complimentary positions. Example: Verizon on top of Apple is good - if their streaming service is good and requires iPhone hardware, you'll see a boost in iPhone sales from Verizon and ATT, etc. Corresponding markets are a good way to double dip on plays. Anyone who supplies Lennar's components for homes, is also probably good (Home Depot, Lowes, etc).\n\n# Want Me To Cover A Ticker?\n\nIf you've got something you are eyeing, I'll occasionally be willing to do a quick analysis of it, if the underlying looks worth it. If it's not, I'll just tell you it's not. If it is, I'll add a section below here that's WSB Picks and pick a few plays on it based on the same criteria the above.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHave fun, good luck, get tendies.", "created_utc": 1553372026, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b4no1s/i_pick_options_so_you_dont_have_to_week_beginning/", "is_self": true}
