I was trolling this subreddit when it was at $6 telling you all to short, and it's not too late. Theaters are a ghost town, and there are no good films on the horizon to save them. They have just enough assets to cover liabilities and shareholders, but assets are taking a big hit in this economy. The income statement for last year looks like all of your bank accounts. This was headed tits up this year with Amazon now producing better films than the theaters, and no real blockbusters coming out. The virus is putting this bad boy to bed, as it should be. AMC theaters are trash, and I personally prefer independent theaters, where the person popping your corn reports directly to ownership. Personal preference aside, I've done my DD, and I'm printing like a boss. If one of those people with brains gets lost and comes here, let me know if you can see any reason this isn't going to zero.\n\nedit: any price 3/20 4/17", "created_utc": 1584001672.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhd4bp/amc_will_keep_printing/", "is_self": true}
