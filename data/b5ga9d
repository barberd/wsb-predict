{"id": "b5ga9d", "title": "Fire Tim Cook that Apple event was terrible", "selftext": "Holy fuck that was the most tepid safe, playing-it-close-to-the-chest Apple announcement I have ever seen. There's so much to break down on how bad this was. The sad thing is it's still going to make Apple money, but it's going to pave the way for competitors and won't make them as much money had they done it right. It's like Disney making a sequel or a reboot: safe, shitty, and still profitable.\n\n**Apple News+**\n\nThey already tried this with The Daily, an app Murdoch and Jobs created in collaboration. And The Daily no longer exists because people don't want to pay for magazine content. Literally the same \"we're collaborating with The Wall Street Journal\". Apple News+ isn't consumer friendly, it's content creator friendly, and just a gimmicky way to try to get people to pay for the news by mimicking the physical value of a magazine with bold images, vivid colors, and pretty scripts, but is not a physical newspaper which is why it will bomb just as The Daily did. But I'm sure there are enough sheeple to keep it going for the near term. Because of course this service is only available for Apple hardware products. $9.99/month is still more expensive than $0/month for all the same content if not better anyone can find online.\n\n**Apple Card**\n\nHaha progressives are going to have a moral dilemma if they want to support Apple with a new credit card if it means also supporting those greedy Goldman Sachs bankers! Seriously Apple, this is pathetic. Apple wants all the rewards and none of the risks, and so instead of getting into banking by creating a financial arm and doing the whole thing in house, they partner with a bank to play it safe because finance actually is quite risky and leads to a slew of new regulations. They probably don't want to be the next GE capital. But this is a huge win for Goldman and MasterCard, I don't see anything of a benefit for Apple. No one is switching to iPhone for this. Sometimes I wonder if Apple just creates products for their own techies in Cupertino, and then just releases it to the public, figuring everyone wants to live like them.\n\n**Apple Arcade**\n\nThe most tepid, boring, lame game announcement I have ever seen, ever. Google made their own handhold gaming console, Apple did nothing! Again, all the benefits, none of the losses of the risk which comes with innovation. Okay, I guess the only difference is that it's playable offline? Again, there's no way gaming makers are going to make a great game if it has to be exclusive to Apple devices and the handheld limits which come with Apple devices. At this point I sometimes wonder if Apple is seeing just how much they can milk users of their stuff and compensate them with warm feelings and a sense of superiority, because this is a joke.\n\n**Apple TV Channels**\n\nSometimes I wonder if I should buy Netflix because they understand video consumption dynamics and other streaming services keep making the same mistakes over and over and over again. People don't want to subscribe to channels to find content, they want to play a flat fee and then have the content delivered directly to them without the hassle. For example, someone will have a more enjoyable experience on Netflix by watching Black Panther because it showed up. Compare this to someone who pays for Apple TV Channels, then pays for Cinemax Channel or whatever, then finally finds Black Panther. Netflix does the work for you by paying the licensing fees, simplifying everything for you. This is why Netflix succeeds where Prime Video goes nowhere as well as all those other services that try to have their cake and eat it too with their own original content as wall as fake expandable libraries if you're willing to pay even more. And again, it's potential is totally limited to Apple users who even want this thing, maybe a handful of smart tv makers they partner with.\n\n**Apple TV+**\n\nIsn't this the service Apple employees were saying Apple NBC because Tim Cook didn't want to offend anyone with the content? Haha what a joke, buy a studio and do it right, this \"storytelling\" sounds dry and boring, something to impress a date but nothing anyone would watch for fun. And again, limited by only people who have Apple devices and want this.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nTim Cook's expertise is in supply chain. Cook is a solid bet, but I'm starting to worry how much of a visionary he is. Because it's one thing to make things that are safe and profitable, it's another thing to push the envelope and develop new, innovative, and incredible content and technologies, and at today's event, Apple didn't do anything new, innovative, or incredible. And quite frankly, it's not a nice feeling to want a service but feel forced to use a product you don't want to use. Like iMessage, I don't want to use an iPhone but I know there are people out there who judge if texts aren't that iMessage blue. But whatever, I cut my losses and stuck with Android, they can deal with the fact my texts come up vomit green. Point is services will make money off of current Apple fans and lovers, but I 100% doubt it will attract new users and help Apple hold onto and even increase iPhone popularity and market share not just domestically, worldwide as well, especially in China.", "created_utc": 1553547395, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b5ga9d/fire_tim_cook_that_apple_event_was_terrible/", "is_self": true}
