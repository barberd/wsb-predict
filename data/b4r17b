But the computers sure think the best thing to do is sell. I'm thinking about how to play the opening on Monday. \n\nI'm in $AAPL puts, having sold all of my calls on Thursday and Friday morning, making some pretty good bank. Now I am holding long positions in Apple, and would like to add shares here. \n\nWith $MSFT, I timed the puts wrong, and got washed out. I had puts for $117 expired Friday, but I was off by a week, I think. Now I am holding some long MSFT shares, and wondering if I hold on to those and add. I may do that. \n\nWould you continue to buy puts in MSFT and AAPL given the noise about the recession? Or would you start buying calls, knowing that the recession fears are overhyped? \n\nAlso, the Trump investigation is going nowhere. But do you think the markets will still want to react to the news event, which is honestly really no news? \n\nOpen to your thoughts, summary below:\n\nI'm leaning towards this: \n\nAdd to spot shares of MSFT and Apple and some other tech growth / used to be growth\n\nsell my puts in Apple on Monday / Tuesday and start buying weak priced calls for summer June / July about $195 - $200 range \n\nbuy some $MSFT calls for summer in the $120 range ", "created_utc": 1553392327, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b4r17b/the_aapl_and_msft_dilemma_how_to_trade_monday/", "is_self": true}
