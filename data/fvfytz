{"id": "fvfytz", "title": "OIL SHORT/LONG & NATGAS LONG - DD - FUTURES", "selftext": "Good morning all! After doing some crazy analysis on /CL and /NG i have noticed some additional opportunities for you autistic individuals... smart people need not apply.\n\nFirst let's take a look at some TA on /CL and some news revolving around the commodity.  For those of you that need a little spoon-feeding, this is Light Crude Oil Futures, contracts trade in 1000x multiple.\n\nNow that we got that fuckery out of the way... Let's get into the deep shit:\n\n/CL has bounced off support around 20 dollars with strong bull balls moving the price up like a stampede of hungry prostitutes. \n\nRecent news that fueled these prostitutes?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jes6fr49r0r41.png?width=748&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e514ea2703b5172fc5c6646dbe7459711d8e95f\n\n [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/us/politics/trump-russia-saudi-arabia-oil.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/us/politics/trump-russia-saudi-arabia-oil.html) \n\nSo, Trump wanted lower prices for oil but now is in panic because prices have spiraled out of control.\n\n [https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Oil-To-Move-Above-41-If-Trumps-Tweet-Is-True.html](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Oil-To-Move-Above-41-If-Trumps-Tweet-Is-True.html) \n\nUnfortunately, he has ran into some serious issues... Meeting with Texas oil prostitutes... they did not accept the idea of cutting output. \n\n [https://www.forbes.com/sites/daneberhart/2020/04/03/pressure-from-president-trump-market-spurs-new-talk-of-oil-cuts--among-producers/#42ffa7776f5c](https://www.forbes.com/sites/daneberhart/2020/04/03/pressure-from-president-trump-market-spurs-new-talk-of-oil-cuts--among-producers/#42ffa7776f5c) \n\nSo, lets go back to TA - Red lines tell you everything....\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dloeiizms0r41.png?width=1628&format=png&auto=webp&s=408ab4e39126889c3e4757f117c5c3129e1da6e2\n\nSo we should see a nice bounce on /CL before we see any major dip below 20's, this is supported by many TA and other indicators. After a slight bounce we should see further decline in price of oil as we go into a storage issue.\n\nThis was posted 6 days ago.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ah6ys8g6t0r41.png?width=890&format=png&auto=webp&s=1183932ac7ca0befaae09254759022fd01a4921f\n\nWhile all of that is happening. /NG also known as NATURAL GAS is benefiting from all this fuckery.\n\nLet me explain: \n\nThere are more people at home now than ever. People are cooling and using their furnaces... they use NAT GAS. Also, as wells begin to close due to oil capacity.. there will be less NAT GAS available.. Increasing prices.\n\n [https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/natural-gas-oil-aeco-wcs-wti-1.5520910](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/natural-gas-oil-aeco-wcs-wti-1.5520910) \n\n [https://www.ft.com/content/e0ae0be9-e2d8-4c35-a3f3-93cef149edc1](https://www.ft.com/content/e0ae0be9-e2d8-4c35-a3f3-93cef149edc1) \n\nNAT GAS has bottomed out and shows major signs of recovery... while looking at the option chain.. we notice this...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t3tnr8ost0r41.png?width=1644&format=png&auto=webp&s=c07ad8be9d38386f63d05b275ccc16860461f3c4\n\nTheres a huge disparity in /NG prices. So we should see a flush to 2's very soon.\n\nPOSITIONS:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r1zpl0w3u0r41.png?width=415&format=png&auto=webp&s=43bb54f092779c4168d79e2015559325fbf3f688\n\nRemember Futures contracts expire 15-25 days ahead of regular expiration.... \n\nFlair me up if you are happy with what you see. I will try to respond to as many questions as i can.\n\nTake a look at my other OIL SHORT posts:\n\n [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffd6cz/oil\\_crash\\_of\\_2020\\_dd/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffd6cz/oil_crash_of_2020_dd/) \n\n [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fnmttb/oil\\_crash\\_of\\_2020\\_round\\_2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fnmttb/oil_crash_of_2020_round_2/)", "created_utc": 1586102205.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fvfytz/oil_shortlong_natgas_long_dd_futures/", "is_self": true}
