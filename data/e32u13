{"id": "e32u13", "title": "Uber DD", "selftext": "Hello america! I am european!\n\nAnyway last week i was in New York on the wallstreet. I wanted to take a pic with the charging bull but it was overwhelmed with asian tourists so I got mad and ordered an Uber. \n\nThe fare was $84, fine for the distance I was doing. Then the day after the \"adjusted my fare\" and pulled another $16 (how is that even legal) without a god damn notification, first warning sign. Then I click on the receipt because I was curious as to the specification to the $16.62 specific amount. The  receipt said ONLY:  \n\nIn addition to other government-mandated taxes and fees, you'll also notice a new Congestion Surcharge on Manhattan trips below 96th St.  \n\nFirst thing, that's unfair as fuck. They knew the initiary before I booked which their algos could calculate into the price they offered even before i booked it. Secondly, where the fuck is the detailing of the specific 16 bucks u just nicked from my man purse??? Just that drives me nuts.\n\nI kept searching for a reasoning for a (to me) huge difference in final price, people were like fees, tolls, traffic but all those were baked in into the first fee i paid with the $84 fare. So I was really curious how they calculated it so I contested the change and demanded a detailing of the fees (IT WASN'T EVEN DETAILED ON THE GOD DAMN RECEIPT HOW ILLEGAL ISN'T THAT).\n\nAnyway, 3 hours later i get an answer. Guess what? A refund for $18, without any form of specification on the error (this to me is the last final warning sign). \n\nAnd you ask me what are the warning signs leading up to? Well, that they do this intentionally. Unsuspecting customers or people that take this at face value: \"In addition to other government-mandated taxes and fees, you'll also notice a new Congestion Surcharge on Manhattan trips below 96th St.\".\n\nSo this leads me to the numbers. They increased my fare by approx 20%. Say they use this technique on 1% of their users. And 30% of the users they pull this on suspect them and get refunded. This leads to the fact that their revenue is exaggerated by a crazy 0.001%. Knowing growth stocks are based on revenue growth that is unacceptable and I'm setting a price target at $0,2 per share.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR SHORT THE FUCK OUT OF UBER", "created_utc": 1574969032, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e32u13/uber_dd/", "is_self": true}
