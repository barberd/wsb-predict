{"id": "ctrm18", "title": "Strategic method to make money during earnings", "selftext": "This strategy requires some DD, but if you do your research, you should be able to pull it off.\n\nHere's how it works. Pick any publicly traded company that is volatile during earnings and has a job in your field. Get an interview that lines up with their earnings date and make sure it's in the same building as where the earnings call takes place.\n\nBefore the interview, load up on some puts. Then around when the earnings call happens, say you need to go to the bathroom. Dial into the earnings call and right before they start talking about projected numbers, pull the fire alarm while making sure no one or any cameras see you.\n\nNo one will ever suspect you since you're just interviewing and the stock should crater since there will be mass panic.\n\nJust make sure you don't get caught, sell your puts and enjoy your fresh tendies.\n\nTl;dr Get interview at a company during earnings, buy puts, pull fire alarm during a bathroom break and profit.", "created_utc": 1566443622, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ctrm18/strategic_method_to_make_money_during_earnings/", "is_self": true}
