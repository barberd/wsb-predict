Purchased 0DTE puts and was about to lose a fuckton of money but was saved by a Trump tweet that caused the market to crash in the last couple hours of trading.\n2. The next day took all of his gains ($580k-ish) and, betting on a rally the next day, he bought deep OTM 0DTE calls.\n3. Sold out after $480k in losses because the market did not rally.\n4. The most autist part?  **If his original put purchase (see bullet #1) had a longer DTE he might have still been in the position during the 100pt crash of the SP500 on 8/5 and could have cashed out for probably millions.**\n\nOn the other hand we have u/1RONYMAN\n\n1. Does bigly research and discovers a trading strategy called \"The Box Spread\", a multi-legged options strat involving both buying/selling deep ITM calls and puts at the same time.\n2. Does bigglier research and discovers that Box Spreads, if sold at the right time, can be sold for a credit with zero risk because his maths told him that when all the option legs expire they will offset each other but he will get paid a small credit due to pricing inefficiencies that only he has noticed.\n3. Sells hundreds of Box Spreads on RH using Margin, gets paid a credit for each box spread, so his account goes from next to nothing to having tens of thousands.\n4. Proceeds to withdraw 10k in cash, because why the fuck not?\n5. Forgets that options come w/ this little thing called assignment risk and that yes, if a Box spread gets held till exp it's risk free... but that's not how option selling works... bc, ya know... assignment risk.\n6. Gets assigned short shares, margin called for a shitton of money that he didn't have in the first place, has account instantly closed out by RH **and RH in a matter of hours officially bans Box Spreads across their entire platform**.\n\nBoth are true paragons of autism but who do you think is the most autistic?  \n\nThe guy who made massive directional bets that made absolutely no sense, not once but TWICE and got fucked?  \n\nOr, the guy who thought he came up with a strategy that couldn't go tits up and bet a shitton of money that he didn't actually have and got fucked because he forgot about the most fundamental way an option functions?", "created_utc": 1565127062, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cmwgsz/who_is_the_true_king_of_the_autists_uanalfarmer/", "is_self": true}
