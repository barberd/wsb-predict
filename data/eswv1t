I picked up 10 contracts of the $340/60 strikes at market open and so far the return is phenomenal, but that's besides the point.\n\nI punched out the numbers and found that Netflex subscriber growth hasn't moved much at all with the integration of competitive platforms via ESPN+, Disney, Apple TV, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, etc. This makes a lot of sense because much of the aforementioned platforms are only going to last several month to a year and expire without resubsciption. This is mainly speculative, but many of these services are actually paired with purchases of new cellphone plans and product purchases (i.e. Free Disney with Apple iPhone 11 purchase, Free Amazon Prime Video for Amazon Prime (making the video segment a non-factor), Hulu with it's year long $1.99 p/m subscription deal offered last Christmas, and ESPN+ which is mainly tailored for sports and no longer offers any viable content since pay-per view is always going to be an added cost). \n\nOn the topic of cashflow, which is huge for Netflix and a primary driver of it's devaluation. In Q1 ER, they burned through $1.7B, and the expected for the rest of the year is going to be around $2.5. They said 2019 was the biggest cash burn year to get the platform on track by increase content value, ease of access, marketing, etc. Seems to me Netflix is making the adjustments to go cash flow positive. \n\nOn fundamentals, a rising wedge is forming very healthily. But who cares about fundamentals lol.\n\nTLDR: I think Netflix might get a bull run this coming week to $375.", "created_utc": 1579802831, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eswv1t/nflx_has_room_to_moonshot/", "is_self": true}
