(https://www.tradingview.com/x/Zs9Zy0Jf/)\n\nFollowing a slight recovery in April, several C-Level executives sold decent amounts of shares from between $43.8 and $45.46. That price hasn't been reached since. 3/31/20 marked a massive institutional sell off of WWE also.\n\nIt has a debt to equity ratio of 210, which massively increased in March.\n\nTV viewers for WWE decreased from February to May by 23%. There have been no live ticketed events and paid subscriber numbers to the WWE network (their streaming service) have essentially been flat, only spiking with notable live events. However their season peak Wrestlemania 36 was made available for free to show that the brand still existed.\n\nThere has been a bevy of articles over the last few days about WWE performers testing positive for Covid, and complaints from performers directly about the unsafe working conditions during the pandemic.\n\nWWE has delayed its annual shareholders meetings 3 times this year, ostensibly due to concerns over hosting a physical meeting during the pandemic - which is clearly at odds with the lack of concern they have for their talent, and a fairly transparent ruse. The latest revised date for the shareholders meeting (now held online) is 7/16.\n\nFinally as a fuzzier point, WWE has many aging performers who have destroyed their bodies. Should a generational superstar die to covid 19, and that death be associated with the companies shitty approach to workplace safety, it would be a huge blow to the company.\n\nAlso wrestling blows dong, who is into that shit nowadays?\n\nTLDR; crayons says wrestling looks shit, financials look shit, product looks shit, covid 19 response looks shit.\n\nWWE going in a figure 4 put lock, 10/16 $30p", "created_utc": 1593296811.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hh2yfo/puts_on_wwe_undertakers_not_getting_back_up_from/", "is_self": true}
