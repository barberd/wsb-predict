I received an email from robinhood saying I have been early assigned 7 contracts on a put credit spread. \n\nOpening Position:\n$299/$298 \n4/26\n7 Put credit Spread \n\nCurrently showing:\n700 Shares SP 500 (RH shows current price 290.03)\n7 Puts SPY $298 4/26\n\nI am aware that to close out of my position I need to exercise the 7 contracts I own, and have emailed robinhood to exercise my 7 contracts. My question is at what price will my 7 contracts be exercised and because I have nowhere near the capital to buy 700 shares of SPY does robinhood automatically exercise corresponding parts your credit spread, so you don\u2019t lose more than your collateral?", "created_utc": 1555391369, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bdq13l/robinhood_early_assignment/", "is_self": true}
