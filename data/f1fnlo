I found out about trading FDs 4 years ago and thought great this looks easy. In my first year I had an account worth $10k. Next few years I gained $250k. Last year I tried trading US options and options and gained about $3M.\n\nI then discovered the holy grail, ACB puts and MSFT calls. I used these too to autistically grow the money I already had and made $10M profit. I got excited and bought a yacht along with 3 hookers and 10 eight balls of blow.\n\nThen I found out that as long as these retards on Robinhood keep buying ACB and selling MSFT calls this literally can't go tits up. So i made $45K in 3 seconds.\n\nIve maxed out my bank account, JPM won't stop fucking calling me and saying I can't keep this much money in a regular checkings account and I need to open a private client account. Oh btw I also scammed  my shitty lawyer out of $10k in 2014. I never went to College, so I call everyone and everything fake and gay. I just had the best 4 years of my life, my girlfriend gangbangs MMA fighters everyday, and I have too many yachts to fit inside this fucking lake I own. Im 26 years old with sever autism.\n\nMy father bathed in tendies, his father bathed in tendies, i too will bathe in tendies.", "created_utc": 1581284546, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f1fnlo/quit_my_job_to_trade_for_a_living_ended_up/", "is_self": true}
