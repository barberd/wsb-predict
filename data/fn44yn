All the fat Americans will be watching Netflix at home due to the quarantine. One more interesting thing to note here, is that cinemas are cancelled which means that [all these new theatrical releases will most likely be pushed to streaming platforms instead](https://www.engadget.com/2020/03/22/paramount-the-lovebirds-direct-to-netflix/), namely Netflix and Disney. The last nail in the coffin is that earnings report will be speculatively released on the [21st of April.](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/nflx/earnings) What happens before an earnings report release, you ask me? Well, uncertainty goes up and IV goes up as well! Which means that the low IV contracts on late April will also go up in values.\n\nTL:DR; TENDIES!\n\nEdit: one more thing to note, is that you want to sell your contracts to FDers before the earnings report, so that you don't get double-penetrated by two BULLS.\n\nEdit 2: POSITION = 24 April 382.5 CALL", "created_utc": 1584900745.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fn44yn/long_nflix_calls_free_tendies_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
