{"id": "f1zjae", "title": "Bull case for chegg post earnings DD", "selftext": "I\u2019m still bullish on chegg. I bought April 50 strikes and I\u2019m certain I will make a profit, my break even is 50.50 at expiration.\n\nHere\u2019s why : \n\nchegg has a large amount of short shares, a whopping 16.9 percent of shares are in a short position,  the stock is getting shorted ah because chegg soared 5 percent today and is near a 52 week high, chegg also has a relatively low float, 116 million, \n\nNow With more solid earnings posted today and a possibly a new reasonable dip to buy after a period of massive growth, The share price will settle and consolidate hopefully around these resistance levels 42- 44, and the dip will start getting bought, as does any dip in this market right now, \n\nAs solid as cheggs report was today, I think it\u2019s safe to predict a massive short squeeze might be coming. With the low float and large shares short percentage, with the stock down after solid earnings, fundamentally I could see a rally that spurs a massive short squeeze taking the stock to new highs in the near future.", "created_utc": 1581379196, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f1zjae/bull_case_for_chegg_post_earnings_dd/", "is_self": true}
