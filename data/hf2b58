It auto-hedges. \n\nAnd the best part is, when the stock reaches its bottom, you can simply buy back the call you\u2019re selling \n\nSo now during the uptrend, you will capture all the profits the (now unhedged) call. \n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nIn my opinion, call debit spreads aren\u2019t enough if you\u2019re balls deep in calls. So in addition to that, you simply buy **put debit spreads** on QQQ and SPY to additionally manage downside. \n\nThe best part about put debit spreads are that when the market inevitably gaps up after you buy the spread, you can simply buy back the put you\u2019re selling. So now you have an unhedged put to provide your entire account protection. \n\n**HERE ARE MY TOTAL RETURNS TODAY FROM BEING BALLS DEEP IN AMZN, SE, DOCU, FSLY, NVDA, AND AMD USING $1000 IN MARGIN**\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/928Y7kn.jpg", "created_utc": 1593010099.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hf2b58/how_to_properly_manage_downside_risk_to_make_as/", "is_self": true}
