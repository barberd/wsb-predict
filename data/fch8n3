Please don\u2019t say futures trading- that was a disaster of epic proportions. Every time I start to get close to 25k I get cucked by a virus or a tweet on Monday morning. I\u2019m trying to set up a rotation of brokers and wire connections so I can trade continuously without flagging. I have 3  accounts now including RH (which is getting closed if it ever comes back up) I\u2019m thinking I need to open 3 more that allow wire transfers for minimized down time. If you have something that works for you while you\u2019re growing your account (s) please feel free to share.", "created_utc": 1583176559, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fch8n3/pdt_gymnastics/", "is_self": true}
