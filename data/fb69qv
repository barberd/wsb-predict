{"id": "fb69qv", "title": "A quick thank you", "selftext": "So I'm not exactly sure what brought me to WSB, probably some r/all post - needless to say I found it.\n\nAbout a four months ago my mothers went through Cancer recurrence of something we thought had been gone for years now. \n\nNeedless to say, I've been working a second job to help save up money and support her with some things back home - (I'm 34, no I don't still live with my mother).  Needless to say after finding this community last week, I pulled some money from my personal savings that I was using to put towards fixing up my basement a bit to try to invest and get some extra capital to help out back home. Worst case if I lost it all, it was for my basement, no big deal.\n\nI watched probably 30 hours of video around options, read nearly every discussion on here, and observed the discord for a while. I started trading around the Ally / AMD spam, was up 2k on my way to work and down 1700 by the time i got there. Lesson learned. \n\nI reached out to some of you for advice in the discord, was called a retard (thanks, I know it's a term of endearment) , and was given some really great advice and guidance. I asked probably 100 stupid questions, but was always given some really strong answers (and sarcastic abuse)\n\nEnd of today I sold my last group of SPY puts (right before the stupid 2.5% upswing) . I ended up around +2000 total . Far from the likes of a lot of you, but 2000 more that will immensely help back home. \n\nI just wanted to take a minute to say thank you to everyone here, even the psychopaths that sometimes blow my mind. \n\nNot sure if I'll dive back in next week - I think Im just going to take the money and run and do what I can to continue helping out - but again, thank you, retards.", "created_utc": 1582945429, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fb69qv/a_quick_thank_you/", "is_self": true}
