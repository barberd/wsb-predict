I just watched an episode of PBS Space Time about consciousness influencing Quantum Mechanics so I'm officially smarter than 99% of this sub.\n\nKey points to take away are that Quantum Physics is strange as fuck and particles do whatever the fuck they want until you look at them. And right there is the golden ticket! Once you observe one of those motherfuckers, you collapse its wave function. It's a wave of probabilities so more observers, more probability in one direction or another.\n\nNow extrapolate that to the stock market, combine it with 870k ~~degenerates~~ observers and we become literal Gods of our reality. All we need to do is keep YOLO'ing and it literally cannot go tits up!\n\nWE. ARE. THE. MARKET.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: \n\nSo basically we as the observers of the stock market, by combining our collective autism, have the power to influence reality so that our meme stonks fly to the Moon, Mars and out past that weird hula hoop shit Saturn has going on.  Buy calls, stonks only go up, ${insert meme stock here} to the moon!", "created_utc": 1582107930, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f68znj/collective_autism_is_real/", "is_self": true}
