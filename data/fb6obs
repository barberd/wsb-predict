However, one particular product, the licensed Baby Yoda Doll(half of you tards probably own one) is basically steroids for their Q4 holiday report. If you give a shit about fundamentals, analysts predict a PT high of 12, and a PT low of 8 and we are currently sitting at the low due to the recent decline in EVERYTHING. Obviously Q4 earnings will not be affected by the beerflu, only guidance could be weakened HOWEVER their supply/production chain is not affected by the global economy(excluding raw material imports probably).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI currently do not have any positions on it as the market is closed but I just wanted to post this since the earnings discussion thread isn't up yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Long FKNO 3/20 10C, Buy shares", "created_utc": 1582947417, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fb6obs/alright_gather_round_childrenfnko/", "is_self": true}
