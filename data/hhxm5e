{"id": "hhxm5e", "title": "SPX Hot Options Trade", "selftext": "I know most of you Robinhood autist wont even understand this trade but I will attempt to dumb it down for you....\n\nUnlike most of you I am typically not an option buyer I like to collect theta in the vast majority of my trades. I am curious what all you degenerates think of  this trade I put on Friday.  FWIW I legged the spreads so I had a fortuitous fill price. You could probably sell the package around 44-46 now\n\n* **Sold 5 - SPX December (Z) 3000/2750/2500 put tree @ 26 for the '2 leg'**\n* **Sold 5 - SPX December (Z) 3200/3250 call spread at @ 25**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you are unaware of what a put tree is.... the trade above indicates I purchased the Z 3000 Put (1x) and sold the 2750 p (1x) and sold the 2500 put (1x) collecting 26  for putting each 1 lot of the tree on.\n\nThen I sold the Z 3200/3250 call spread. In total I collected a total of 51 \"ticks\" which is $5100 per 1 lot of the package.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI love this trade for a number of reasons.\n\n1. You are short vol and get to collect a decent amount of theta.\n\n* Ie. The trade decays in your favor. and frankly IV is still very high in the S&P.\n* Even if we go up towards my short call spread vol will come in which will be a net positive for my position in most cases regardless of the short deltas from my short call spread\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) I view it as a incredibly high expected value to be a winner. really hard to loose when you look at break even points.... Assuming I hold it to expiration which I probably wont but it makes it easier for you amateurs to understand. But my plan is to take it off as it decays and possibly hold a 1 or 2 lot till expiration depending on where the index is trading.\n\n* At expiration to the upside there is no way I can loose money. I collected 51 points for the package and the most my short call spread can be worth at expiration is 50. Thus even if we blow through my short call spread I still make a whopping 1 S&P point ($100 per package I trade).\n* Now to the downside my downside break even at expiration is around 2199. This math is rather simple and that Is at 2199 my long put is worth +801 my short 2750 is worth -551 my short 2500 is worth -301 and I collected +51 in premium.... SO in total that nets out to -1 thus basically my downside break even.\n* Frankly I am not even worried about the downside because I do not mind buying a boatload of the S&P at that price for a long term investor and honestly if we do get down there I could always put on another tree because vol would be lunar expanding my break even dramatically. But this is more of a portfolio trade I put on knowing I would happy to get long at those levels. that is the major caveat to this trade\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3) It wins big where I think fair value is. around 2750-2650.\n\n* This trade makes the maximum at expiration if we expire anywhere between 2750/2500. I would make  the maximum of 301 S&P points per package I put on which is $30,100. So with my 5 contracts $150,500\n* Again I would be hard pressed to make that much because I will probably take it off as it decays.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4) The only way I would net loose is S&P under 2200 and at that point BTFD. The fed will come in and save the day (which is a sad concept)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust to make it easier for the robinhooders I will post a PnL graph of the trade.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Capitalizing on S&P skew to put on a high risk reward trade as a part of a portfolio collecting a significant amount of premium and getting me some tendies on a small retrace into end of the year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHappy Trading!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rwxneu21xt751.jpg?width=478&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8bd4b70e4d66791b4fd599c723cae40cfd15b37", "created_utc": 1593427396.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hhxm5e/spx_hot_options_trade/", "is_self": true}
