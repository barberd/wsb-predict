{"id": "bbs6di", "title": "IV and IV Crush Explained", "selftext": "The amount of people in the daily thread not understanding what IV is is kind of sad. I don't know how you guys are playing earnings without an understanding of it. \n\n\nJk I lost 20k before someone even said the word to me to google on here. \n\n\nOkay here's what IV is:\n\nStands for Implied Volatility \n\nStocks are generally not volatile. They move up sometimes, they move down sometimes. Like a seesaw. But sometimes they don't move at all. That means they are flat. Like a piece of paper. \n\nBut sometimes what happens is you get news coming out. Maybe a press conference. Maybe the FED is making an announcement. Maybe the company is releasing an Earnings Report (ER). When news like this is scheduled to come out, options expiring that week or afterwards have more IV. This means they cost more.\n\nImagine you're going to ask out your crush after school. All day during all your classes you're looking forward to it. You're building up anticipation. This anticipation is IV. \n\nNow comes the moment of truth. You ask her out. 1 of 2 things happens:\n\nShe says yes! Omg you're so happy! You feel like you could jump over the \"moon\". This is what it's like when a company beats expected earnings in their ER. The stock price goes to the \"moon\". \n(Unless they have bad guidance, think of this like your crush saying she won't have sex with you til marriage, yeah you're dating now but you don't get anything out of it)\n\n**OR**\n\n\nShe says no :( You contemplate suicide. You attempted suicide. You fail. You're a failure. This is what it's like when a company misses earnings. The stock goes down. Your calls are worthless. Just like you. \n\n\nBut hey! Wait a second you say! You actually bought puts! This is good news isn't it? \n\nMaybe.\n\nMaybe not. \n\nMaybe go fuck yourself. \n\nNow remember how I said you were looking forward to asking out your crush all day. Now it happened and you have your answer. This is where IV Crush comes in. You no longer have anything to look forward to. Maybe the results were in your favour (probably not). But you now have nothing for tomorrow. The IV is down now. The announcement of earnings, or the press conference, or whatever has passed. There's no longer any news to significantly affect the stock price. It's going to go back to trading slowly. There is no longer a premium on your options. \n\n\nSo long story short. Options are sold based on a premium. When there is an announcement expected the IV is higher so the premium is higher, after the announcement the IV is CRUSHED so the premium is lower. \n\nIf a stock is trading at $100 and you buy calls for $105 at a premium of $3 that means your break even is $108. Even with good news, if the stock goes to $107 (A decent 7% increase) you will still lose money.\n\n\nGet it now?", "created_utc": 1554934424, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bbs6di/iv_and_iv_crush_explained/", "is_self": true}
