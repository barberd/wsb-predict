The previous CEO also had terms in the deal where he would become CEO of the combined company after the merger, and they allegedly did not agree on his salary as part of the negotiations.  ISS / Glass Lewis reviewed the terms of the deal and recommended RAD shareholder's vote against.  There was other questionable behavior like warning about an inability to compete / re-imbursement pressures right before the merger vote to scare shareholders (imo) and writing down the good will value of the PBM that was bought for $2B, spending millions to integrate rite aid software with albertson's before the merger was approved (and ultimately cancelled the night before the vote)\n\n\\- I believe the price is being held down in part by analyst price targets, RAD was finally about to cross $10 / share when DB decided to initiate coverage with a price target of $5 / share.  After RAD destroyed earnings estimates, DB's target was updated to $12 which was again below the current price\n\n\\- the previous CEO was rated the 4th worst CEO in America by one observer  \n\n\\- the stock shot up to $22+/share after chrismas because of their earnings, but then was shorted back down to the current price of $13.22\n\n\\- Last night the WSJ reported updated short interest of almost 36% of the float as of 1/31\n\n\\- CVS had earnings this AM with same store sales up 3.2% with pharmacy sales up 4.1%\n\n\\- Priced in (imo): massive short position, a belief that the previous CEO was doing his best, \"fake\" price targets like $1/share, etc", "created_utc": 1581526460, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f2u61h/buy_rad_stockscalls_ftw/", "is_self": true}
