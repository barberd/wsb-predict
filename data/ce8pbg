If it's between 90-91 its time to make money because it recovers well. I have seen returns every time within a short time. Right now the gaming company, as are others, are in the midst of legal issues regarding loot boxes and EA also fell short on Apex for Season 2 from what we know. But holding the star wars license and seeing a release coming up, it will sell because its star wars. The stock dipped under 90 for the first time in a long time. Time for some tendies as this stock is going to recover as it has been.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. $CGC should never be this low and with cannabis only moving more toward legalization this company will follow as it is one of the bigger cannabis companies that has been buying out smaller companies and aggressively expanding. $IIRP is a company that sells property to cannabis companies and it isn\u2019t slowing down keep an eye out on companies like these. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. $ASNT If you got in last march before they shut down their stock trading you\u2019re in the money but you will have your chance if you get in once it opens up. The company was in shambles and a small group started buying majority stock, overthrew the board and created their own with a solid group. They were able to keep their operating license in one state and are still cleaning up legal and financial issues after the last board basically put the company on life support but they\u2019re pushing through the shit and giving weekly/biweekly reports of what they\u2019re doing. One to watch for sure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast bit is anyone know of any advertising companies for cannabis in the states? Those are gonna be a commodity as navigating state and federal laws surrounding advertising is a bitch and if there\u2019s a solid company that can tie toe and jump through hoops, they\u2019re gonna be in the money until federal and state laws get on the same level, any companies in mind?", "created_utc": 1563342230, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ce8pbg/night_time_dds_to_snack_on/", "is_self": true}
