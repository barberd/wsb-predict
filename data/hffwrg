Opinions?", "selftext": "I opened a WeBull account like two weeks ago just to check it out because it seemed pretty legit and $0 per contract is very nice. Love the UI of their app. Went through and checked out their desktop app as well and am pretty impressed. I\u2019m using thinkorswim currently and have enjoyed my experience with it but I\u2019m going to keep a small account in WeBull and use it over the next few weeks and may end up switching. Anyone else made the switch and have opinions?
