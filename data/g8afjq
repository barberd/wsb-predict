Retards decide.", "selftext": "Hello autists and most-likely retards,\n\nThis retard has been dating an art-schooled, and recently autistic, woman. She makes shit on the side, sells vintage clothes scrounged thrifting (pretty awesome returns if you can stomach the scrounging. I cannot.), and has a few clients she sews garments and leather products for as a contractor. She now sews masks and sells them on ETSY. ETSY has been encouraging sellers to produce masks to meet demand.\n\nAnyway, her vintage ETSY store has seen a solid uptick in sales. ETSY's call for masks has produced a solid bump on stores sales. Clothes are moving after stimulus checks hit.\n\nOther shit of value is sold on EBAY, where sales of random shit has been solidly steady. \n\nProbably anecdotal bullshit, but potentially infornation to lose money on.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSlammer", "created_utc": 1587887198.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g8afjq/etsy_dd_or_anecdotal_shitpost_retards_decide/", "is_self": true}
