{"id": "gm37gk", "title": "Short the literal FUCK out of IQ", "selftext": "**Disclaimer and Risks:** This is not financial advice, and you must always be cautious when betting against Winnie the Pooh. One major risk factor is the fact that BIDU owns 50% of IQ, and even more worrisome is that [30% of BIDU\u2019s revenue stems from IQ.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/01/29/what-are-baidus-key-sources-of-revenues/#470fe0004642) Whether or not China will intervene to prevent the plunge in value of its own version of Google is unknown, but is certainly a risk that should be hedged against. I\u2019m very confident on this trade and have verified some of the more important arguments lined in the paper, but as always do your own DD and hedge appropriately. \n\nHello you beautiful bastards, it\u2019s been a while. I\u2019m back with another DD, but this time it\u2019ll be a little different than my usual options-exclusive DD. As we all know, volatility was crazy during most of last week, making the Unusual Options Strategy extremely difficult to use due to the amount of noise that was in the options market. In addition, me and the gang are hard at work perfecting our analysis and filtration strategies, so it was a good week to diverge from my usual spiel on Unusual Options. \n\nNow I\u2019ve already seen a couple posts on iQIYI, or $IQ and its potentially fraudulent financial statements. However, me and my team did a deep dive into IQ and the Wolfpack Research report on the subject, and I wanted to offer my own voice in this discussion. \n\n**What is IQ?**\n\nAbout a month ago, Wolfpack Research released [this](https://wolfpackresearch.com/iq-netflix-of-china-good-luckin/) report on its findings of evidence of IQ inflating its numbers. While Wolfpack doesn\u2019t exactly have the best track record, the report was corroborated by Muddy Waters, who have a much cleaner track record for spotting these potential frauds. \n\nIQ is known as the \"Netflix of China\", and is valued at around 12 billion dollars currently. It allows users to stream videos. The company is based in Beijing and is partly owned by Baidu, the \"Google of China\". It had its IPO in 2018 and is currently sitting at $17.95 per share.\n\nSome of you have pointed out that it\u2019s not the same situation as LK, as LK was cut and dry fraud and the IQ is simply inflating the numbers. I am here to tell you not only is IQ inflating the numbers, it\u2019s actively taking steps to disguise its completely fabricated revenue, user count, and investments. Here is a detailed outline of what exactly the Wolfpack Report has found and see for yourselves if you think IQ should be valued at 12 billion right now. \n\n**How is IQ inflating its share prices?**\n\n* Inflation of user numbers\n   * Wolfpack has talked to several independent advertising firms, who both have concluded that IQ's user numbers are 60.3% lower than the 175 million claimed by IQ.\n   * There is evidence of click-farming. Tibet and Hainan, both with small populations, have more user activity than a majority of Tier 1 Chinese cities, activity that could not be feasibly supported by the population in these regions.\n   * Quest Mobile report showed IQ users were overstated by at least 62%.\n* Revenue Inflation\n   * By inflating users, it can heavily inflate revenue numbers.\n   * Barter revenues on average draw in 1-5k RMB per episode. In 2018, IQ reported 1 billion RMB in licensed barter revenue. The total number of TV episodes produced in China for 2018 was 13,726, implying a barter price of nearly 80,000 RMB per episode.\n   * Large scale barter transactions are already a red flag for the SEC due to their easily manipulatable nature. IQ almost entirely deals with barter transactions.\n* Deferred Revenue Inflation\n   * IQ users prepay, so there is always a significant amount of deferred revenues on their financial statements.\n   * However, the reported deferred revenue to Chinese creditors vastly differs from the SEC, with some numbers inflated almost 70% and more to the SEC through their Form F-1\n   * Deferred revenue is also increasing significantly faster than its user growth, suggesting that at least one of these numbers is fraudulent.\n* Dual Membership and Partnerships.\n   * 31.9% of users are VIP users. These VIP members come from affiliate services, such as buy 2 services for one, with one of the services being a subscription to IQ. These revenues are recorded in gross basis, with revenues fully recognized and partner share of revenue is expensed immediately, a practice not generally accepted by GAAP.\n   * IQ has also failed to disclose partnerships, very opaque reporting on revenues and expenses.\n* Xin'ai Sports\n   * IQ claims to have a 32% stake in Beijing's Xin'ai Sports Media Technology from a $115.77 million investment, but Xin'ai's documents show only a $5.6 million investment by IQ in 2018.\n   * IQ claims the majority of its investment as \"content to be delivered\". It has deferred revenue of $100 million, which is most likely completely fraudulent as no content has been delivered to Xin'ai as of 2020.\n   * IQ's share of Xin'ai has actually been diluted due to lack of additional contributions and increased investments by other parties.\n   * The 796 million RMB investment shows up nowhere on Xin'ai's balance sheet as of 2019.\n* Inflated Advertising Revenue\n   * Cumulative overstatement of 5.1 billion RMB in advertising revenues from 2015-2018.\n   * Info collected from IQ's primary and secondary advertising companies indicate an overstatement of 74% in advertising revenues reported to the SEC.\n* Skymoon Acquisition\n   * IQ acquired Skymoon for an astronomical $300 million in 2018, shortly before a Chinese court found that the company's only mildly successful game was stolen IP.\n   * Go to [Skymoons.com](https://skymoons.com/) and please tell me that it's worth 300 million dollars.\n   * They've also created a website called crimoon.net . Same question as above.\n   * IQ was suspected to have acquired the company to siphon off inflated cash balances as well as dump expenses from their income statements.\n   * IQ has also completely failed to consolidate Skymoon's financial statements into their own, claiming \"undue cost\" to convert Skymoon's financials into GAAP. However, the purchase agreement provided to the SEC directly contradicts this, which documents that skymoon had already provided IQ with GAAP adjusted financial statements.\n   * This fact basically either proves the fraudulent nature of IQ's financials or the complete incompetency of IQ's management, both of which play into the bear thesis.\n* How Items are Displayed on Financial Statements\n   * Business-wise, IQ is structured very similarly to Netflix. However, the way to two list their content acquisition differs greatly. While Netflix lists content acquisition in Cash Flows from Operating, AKA the cash flows from the core business, IQ lists them in Cash Flows from Investing, a place that is usually reserved for Capex and investments in infrastructure.\n   * IQ further inflates their cash flows by reconciling the amortization of these assets, assets that never showed up in operations in the first place.\n\nThere's more and more evidence piling up against IQ. [Here is Wolfpack's full report.](https://wolfpackresearch.com/iq-netflix-of-china-good-luckin/) There are numerous red flags on IQ's financial statements, and the fact that the stock is still trading at such a premium is absolute insanity. Any single one of the factors above could mean a HUGE drop in share price, and yet we have almost a dozen of these factors congruent to each other. It\u2019s safe to assume investigations of IQ are already well underway, and any negative news will send this stock drilling to the fucking core.\n\n**Options Activity**\n\nIn terms of Options Activity, IQ had a fairly large put buy ahead of their earnings. However, that is not the real focus. If you were to look at the option chain on the LEAPS for IQ, you'll notice huge open interest in the January 2021 put contracts. This indicates that either funds are hedging against a downturn in IQ or are betting for a downturn in IQ's price similar to LK's earlier this year. Either situation plays very much into the bear thesis. There is also significant put option open interest on BIDU.\n\n**What the move?**\n\nWhat to play? IQ is a fraudulent company, so their earnings report on Monday is not necessarily going to reflect reality, and therefore the stock price will most likely not drill. However, the prices on the May 22 expiry options imply that you would only need a 1-2 dollar movement in price to be profitable with a strangle, regardless of IV, thus allowing you to profit from both sides in the short term.\n\nIn terms of the long term play, IQ will go down just like LK did, it's just a matter of when. LK tanked around 3 months after the Wolfpack report was released. This current report was released April 7th, and already numerous [agencies and organizations](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/iq-stock-berger-montague-continues-191500899.html) are investigating IQ and its business partners, as well as several independent law firms. \n\n**My Personal Position and TL,DR**\n\nI\u2019m personally going with the IQ Sept 18th 15p in order to balance out my cost basis and risk. They\u2019re fairly cheap and will give me plenty of time to roll out to December puts if price action hasn\u2019t moved by July. I\u2019m hedging with 5/22 18C to play earnings and make sure I don\u2019t get burnt if there happens to be a run-up and short term volatility.", "created_utc": 1589814623.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gm37gk/short_the_literal_fuck_out_of_iq/", "is_self": true}
