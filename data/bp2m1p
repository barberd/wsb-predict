Apology thread and update", "selftext": "OK so if you bought BYND on my DD you're up 20% or something so that's nice, but  I think there are some extremely dangerous potential factors pushing up this valuation. The float % is not tiny but it's small enough that given it is the only major vegan/sustainable company it is being picked up by people who are ideologically interested in that sort of thing(actually that includes myself), or who run funds that automatically allocate to those sorts of companies-- this can cause the valuation to go much higher than it deserves, easily and the best thing to do in these scenarios is ALWAYS just stay out. If there is a chance it is a bubble it will come down to earth, if it's not a bubble there will be buying opportunities in the future, so don't worry about it, go smoke a blunt, walk your dog, read some autism on wsb.\n\nThere is another very dangerous consideration which is that Burger King is soon rolling out the Impossible Whopper to the entire US market, and Impossible's product is widely considered to be better based on their blood imitation technology. The Beyond Burger is 70% of BYND's revenue-- BYND is cleverly getting ahead of the realization that their product is inferior in order to sell their stock. Or, at least, this situation looks surprisingly plausible and is a reason in and of itself to just wait on the sidelines for a little while, even if you like the company on the whole.\n\nThere is also an interesting TAM mismatch. Let's look at their comments on the TAM:\n\n&gt;the meat industry is the largest category in food and in 2017 generated estimated sales across retail and foodservice channels of approximately $270 billion in the United States\n\nThis figure includes many meat-tangential activities-- retail, transportation, food service. BYND does not operate in these categories-- there are no BYND restaurants or BYND grocery stores. Hence this comparison is misleading, bordering on fraudulent. The real TAM is 10-100x smaller than their claimed figures, and this is likely leading many to think that the potential opportunity is far larger than it is. I actually like this company a lot in terms of what they have historically achieved, but it is fully valued.\n\nConclusion: Costco will strike deals with one or both of BYND and Impossible Foods, then eventually create a private label brand and undercut the fuck out of them.
