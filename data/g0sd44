{"id": "g0sd44", "title": "What Is the Bottom?", "selftext": " TL;DR -\n\nTime and price symmetry are analysis of general market structure. Coupled with TA, it indicates that we will bottom out for this year on or around November 14th. The price of SPY when we bottom out for this year should be 220.09 or less.\n\nSPY 220p 11/20\n\nPrevious Post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fzhs4d/when\\_will\\_we\\_bottom\\_out/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fzhs4d/when_will_we_bottom_out/)\n\n\\- - -\n\nUnfortunately, my last post seemed to be a bit too drawn out to capture the attention of the autists. As such, this one will be more succinct. The  last post was on Time Symmetry. This post will describe price symmetry, which is a quantitative measurement of a deterministic value for price. Basically, we want to determine at what price the market will reach an inflection point based on reactive \u201cprice clusters\u201d, derived from laws of supply and demand. \n\nThe basis of our discussion will rest on the following premise: if an instrument fails to achieve a new high in a range, it must achieve a new low in said range. If an instrument fails to achieve a new low in a range, it must achieve a new high in said range.\n\no *Price Theory* \u2013 market seeks to yield to one of two price objectives, therefore it is not random. Efficiency occurs at some price level, however price theory does not tell us the exact efficient price, simply the direction of the probable efficient price. When coupled with time structure, gives near certainty to call market inflection points.\n\n\u00b7 The price that an instrument or market reaches efficiency is unknown, but the price objective is certainty which indicates that a future price is the present price objective. \n\n\u00a7 Price Patterns \u2013 price structure components is based on the market\u2019s movements which conform to price objectives.\n\n\u00b7 Price Pattern Objectives \u2013 a possible area of mathematical support or resistance that may serve as a market inflection point. opposed to price theory objectives which are certain. \n\n\u00a7 Inflection point \u2013 a level at which the market finds support or resistance and reverses from a value, commonly misconstrued with pivot points.\n\n\u00a7 Projection Range \u2013 Predefined by mathematical calculations to determine possible terminal points for continued price action.\n\n\u00a7 Mathematical Cluster \u2013 average of multiple mathematical support or resistance numbers occurring around the same approximate value. \n\n\u00a7 Retracement levels \u2013 each level has own nuances and tendencies. Not every retracement bounce leads to successful trades which replace discretes. Must be used with tight stop-losses in order to validate large risk-to-reward ratios.\n\n\u00b7 Retracement memory \u2013 markets tendency to continue having retracements of future ranges equal to retracements of prior ranges which have been expanded\n\nSPY has currently retraced 38.2% of the ABC swing which began this bear market. The 38.2%R is the second most magnetizing retracement, markets will often find price action occurring at this level regardless of whether or not it holds. Most instruments have a reaction at this level.\n\n\u00b7 Projections \u2013 quantifiable mathematical support or resistance calculation, different projection levels exist for different price patterns. Allow us to anticipate when to take profits or anticipate mathematical support/resistance.\n\no Projection Levels \u2013 PPN(A, B, C) = (PB \u2013 PA) \\* PN + PC \n\no PN \u2013 projection Percentages (61.8%, 100%, 127.2%, 161.8%, 200%, and 261.8)\n\no A, B, C being the swing points\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f7sllsernns41.png?width=1299&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9d4d75dfc69d84c4b63d2f6d017ac0dd1c52b4c\n\nWhen you plug the numbers into the formula, you will get a variety of projections for SPY. Anyways, SPY right now sits at 275.63. The closest projection is the 61.8%, also the most well known projection. This projection is only really useful to determine a shallow projection point indicating a later deeper retracement point.\n\nInterestingly enough, this sits at the same value as another swing point on 11/1/2018.\n\nHowever, we could have more confidence in a 100%P - the most important of all the projection percentages, instrument will typically encounter some type of support or resistance when reaching it. It could yield either a temporary pullback or a true market inflection point, so price action must be focused on at this level. It is a price pattern objective for all swings. It is a potential target once any swing activates, but only time will reveal if it is a true terminal point.\n\nThis level may be the conclusion of a corrective swing. If 50% holds an instrument, leading to swing activation, then there is a higher probability that 100% will be a true market inflection point. This projection allows us a clue as to whether we are witnessing a true trend change or if a correction inside the previous trend is simply being completed.\n\nTherefore, SPY will either try to reach 100%P, which is 286.25, when break downwards, or, it is possible that the previous swing point coupled with the 61.8%P we have already reached, being in the 38.2%R, could cause us to turn downwards. If the latter is the case, we should see a large downturn tomorrow. Otherwise, I expect we will eventually reach 286.25 over the course of a month or so, then downturn.\n\nSo, where will SPY reach mid-November?\n\nPrice theory tells us that the goal is for the market to take out either its high or its low within a range. The negative 100%P for SPY is 220.09. Therefore, considering that this is less than half of the possible projections (261.8%P being the max, uncharted territory for the range), it is extremely likely that SPY will not only reach this value but also go significantly lower. Once it reaches 220.09, the trader should take partial profits and begin monitoring it intensely for further action.\n\nTherefore, a wise trader could take puts from the current value on down to 220 with an 11/4 expiry date, selling along the way and capitalizing.\n\nIt should be noted that I am no expert by any means, I'm actually quite  new to this, it is just an elementary analysis of patterns in price and  time. I am not a financial advisor, and this is not advice for a person  to enter trades upon.", "created_utc": 1586814305.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0sd44/what_is_the_bottom/", "is_self": true}
