{"id": "eowa3u", "title": "Bull Rally since October", "selftext": "Hi friends,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust wanted your autistic points of view as to why the market has rallied so fkn much since October? Where is this money coming from? Who is buying all these stocks?\n\nIn October, everyone was saying that the market was at all time high and then it goes full retard? When does it stop? Look at AMD, 5 years of future earnings priced in? Holy f.......!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI can't even look at graphs without getting drowsy anymore... They're like at a 60 degree angle going up and I just wonder, when does it stop? Is it true that stonks only go up? Just know that I have been bearish for you autists cuz I know the moment I buy a call, that's when everything will fkn crash... You're welcome.\n\nStay strong bears \u270c\ufe0f\u262e\ufe0f", "created_utc": 1579057022, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eowa3u/bull_rally_since_october/", "is_self": true}
