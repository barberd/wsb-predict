{"id": "f7g8th", "title": "$SAFE ONLY GOES UPPY", "selftext": "This thing's a choo choo tendy train of tax-haven greatness.  $SAFE specializes in ground-leases in the top-25 markets nationwide generating rental income (void of gains tax on sale, since they retain ownership... and aren't selling the property) without the burden of development costs as that falls into the lap of the tenants.  You stupid dollar-menu-loving fucks have probably eaten at a MiccyD's in an metropolitan area that's likely operated under a ground-lease.  It's popular for franchisees and profitable for landowners who have all sorts of smart lawyer bullshit baked into their contracts with tiny font and lots of big words that allows them to raise rents when tenants do buttseks stuff like use their student loans to add gloryholes in the bathroom.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome of the smarter autists here may say 'hey, isn't rental income taxable?' while thats true that doesn't mean it isn't as profitable as selling.  If capital gains tax exceeds rental income tax, and if you can stick your dumbass tenants with all kinds of gey stuff, you can make much monies.  SAFE is good at making monies, and if they have MiccyD's as a tenant, they make TENDIES too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntldr; Just look at the stonk, it's dripping in tendies and is SAFE, like condom-wearing-gey-safe!", "created_utc": 1582313420, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7g8th/safe_only_goes_uppy/", "is_self": true}
