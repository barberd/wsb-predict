For the few non-smooth-brained readers lurking in the subreddit, I've got some delicious DD, fresh off the press at my school\u2019s investment club (disclaimer: I\u2019m too autistic to come up with any of this shit. This is some senior\u2019s stock pitch from a few days ago, but I figured it was too good not to paraphrase and share with you fags).\n\nTLDR for the retards: $SPY 4/20 $69P\n# What\u2019s an \u201cEvercore\u201d???\nEvercore is a boutique investment bank, AKA a House of Chads that your wife visits while you're at work. In 2019, they were number 1 in advisory revenues and M&A volume among independent firms. **Their advisory market share among ALL FIRMS (including MS, GS, Citi, Merrill, etc.) has grown from 2% in 2010 to 8% in 2019.** Basically, these Schlomos have gone from being that one weird kid on the playground that none of the clients wanted to play with, to **stealing Goldman Jewberg's fucking latkas** from under his nose. But more on that later.\n# Key Points\n##### Their restructuring (RX) division is gonna kick ass in this downturn\nIn case you've been living in your mom's basement this entire time (wouldn't be surprised tbh), we are about to enter one shitstorm of a recession. Not only that, but companies are levered to the tits. ***Investment banking divisions at the Big Boy Shops (MS, GS, Citi, JPM, etc.) are gonna get fucked.*** You see, these big boys can't offset their declines in M&A revenues with RX like the boutiques can due to conflicts of interest. That's where EVR comes in. **In the last recession, their investment banking revenues were $300M in 2009 and $190M in 2008, even though M&A activity fell 25% and 40% in those years respectively because of their RX group.** If you look at their revenues vs. their public comps at the time (Lazard, GS, Greenhill), Evercore's revenues fell a lot less and grew way faster after the recession.\n##### They are growing way faster and (this is important) *way more efficiently* than their peers\nEvercore's revenue has exploded compared to their peers (Lazard, PJT, Moelis, Houlihan, Greenhill) since the recession. **What's crazy about Evercore is that they've done it while also expanding their operating margin.** In simpler terms - if you want the hotshots at an i-bank to bring in more dough (revenue growth), you usually have to buy them more hookers and blow (operating expenses). I don't know what kind of operating model (Epstein didn't kill himself) they\u2019re using at Evercore, but it seems to be working. Revenue CAGR over the last 5 years is 20%, and EPS has grown at a CAGR of 25% since the recession. Crazy stuff.\n##### They like to reward shareholders (hint: that means you!)\nThis one is geared slightly more towards the boomer doomers in r/investing, but could still support the stock if you\u2019re autistic and want to buy somewhat longer-dated options on it. Over the last 5 years, **they've spent an average of $300M per year on buybacks and dividends, with $400M spent in 2019.** Why the fuck are these greedy i-banker Jews spending so much on buybacks??? Don't they want to dole out fat bonuses so that they can support their wives' swinger habits??? Great question - it's **because employees own a whopping 30% of the firm** (on a fully diluted basis). There's also a decent chunk of equity compensation among those Mossad bankers, and **over 98% of the restricted stock units are still unvested**, so these monkeys still have to pound the hamster wheel for a few more years. Good news for investors like us (that\u2019s right \u2013 institutions own a shit ton of the company as well, way above average).\n# WhAt aBoUt iT\u2019s pEeRs???\nSome of the savants in the audience might be quick to point out that Evercore's peers also have restructuring divisions. In fact, Houlihan Lokey (HLI) and PJT have a waaaayy bigger focus on RX than Evercore. \n\nGood point, but you are just the type of retard on r/investing that would say \"buy the stock, the company is gonna make mad profits this year cuz of X braindead reason that is already priced in 100x\". No shit, the market already knows this. These firms (HLI and PJT) are priced at 12-month P/Es of 21x and 55x, respectively, and Price-to-book ratios of 4x and 52x respectively. **Evercore is trading at a disgusting discount of 6.9x (LMAOO) P/E and 2.1x P/B.** Sure, you are getting *less of that juicy RX revenue,* but you are getting it *insanely cheaply*. And besides, when this is all over, they will continue to bully the shit out of those cucks at Goldman and the rest of J-Pow's harem.\n# PoSiTiOnS???\nBecause most of you autists don\u2019t do much besides jerk off to your wife getting plowed by her boyfriend and lose your money on FDs, you wouldn\u2019t have the brainpower to come up with a way to capitalize on this DD. Well, I figure that if I\u2019ve gotten this far in writing this fucking erotic novel of investment research for you cucks, then I might as well finish with the cumshot.\n&nbsp;\n**This DD leads me to conclude that this thing could hit at least $65 in the next few months.** It is currently at $53. The way to play this, from most to least autistic, is as follows:\n\n1.\tBuy $60 calls expiring this/next week. Don't do this. If you do this, fuck you, you deserve to lose your money.\n2.\tWait for the \u201cDiP\u201d that every piece of TA around here has been saying is right around the corner for the past two weeks. EVR will probably tank with the rest of the market. When it hits, say ~$40 (or be a greedy bitch and wait for it to break the recent bottom of $33), buy $50-55 strike calls with 1M to expiry. Once the market finishes the ride down and J-Pow turns off the faucet, EVR will moon. \n3.\t**Buy 6/19/20 $65 calls.** Don\u2019t go way OTM, there\u2019s basically no volume on the options, so you\u2019re gonna need it to be ATM or ITM near expiry.\n4.\t**Buy 9/18/20 $65 calls.** Give yourself 3M more runway, retard.\n5.\tJust buy the fucking stock. This is a great opportunity to get into EVR (yes you, not just your wife on the weekend) at a cheap(er) valuation. Given their history of buybacks and dividends, as well as their growth and cheap valuation, you will (probably) make money.\n\n## Actual TLDR: Long $EVR 6/19 $65C", "created_utc": 1586355163.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fx75y3/evercore_evr_will_moon_over_the_next_6_months/", "is_self": true}
