I made 80k the first time someone mentioned PG&E when it shot to $18 a few months back.\n\nSince then, thanks to https://redd.it/gk9fea and other posts I've been keeping track of it with Sept 18 $20c from a couple weeks back with the big hedge fund buy.\n\nLoaded up on more calls today from the dip, there is strong support at $11.30-11.50. Analysts and stocktwits are bullish, and IV should spike tmrw from the confirmation hearing and vote, also for the next couple weeks from each milestone.\n\nThere are those that think MM's are artificially pushing prices down for the May 29 expiry as the put calls ratio tells the story of a lot more ppl buying calls.\n\nEdit w/ answer about my position: I went w/ the smart money and bought Sept 18 $20 calls.\n\nEdit 2: Thank you kind stranger, this is the first reward I've ever gotten. I hope you're able to make some money off this post.", "created_utc": 1590513001.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gr1311/pcg_confirmation_vote_tomorrow/", "is_self": true}
