There is also no science BS in this post. I am going to provide succinct evidence and really want you to put aside anything you have read in media because its distorted and has an agenda.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am only linking FDA and Fauci stuff here, sorry Fake News Folks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am in healthcare, and I do not work for any drug/pharmaceutical company. I have no disclosures/conflicts of interest to be made. I am not being paid for any of my statements.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(1) [https://www.fda.gov/media/136537/download](https://www.fda.gov/media/136537/download) FDA grants Emergency use Authorization for Hydroxychloroquine. I encourage you to read. It has been LONG known that the drug has interactions with Heart Medications and those with arrhythmia. It says it in the Emergency use authorization. This was not something \"discovered\" out of thin air a few weeks ago.\n\n\\- Point (1) - FDA \" Although limited scientific information is available, it is reasonable to believe that hydroxychloroquine sulfate may be effective for treatment of adults and adolescents who weigh 50 kg or more and are hospitalized with COVID-19 for whom a clinical trial is not available, or participation is not feasible, as specified in this Fact Sheet.  You may be contacted and asked to provide information to help with the assessment of the use of the product during this emergency. Serious adverse events related to the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate must be reported to FDA through FDA\u2019s MEDWATCH Voluntary Online reporting www.fda.gov/medwatch/report.htm. Please include in the field name, \u201cDescribe Event, Problem, or Product Use/Medication Error\u201d the following statement: Hydroxychloroquine Sulfate Treatment under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).This EUA for hydroxychloroquine sulfate will end when the Secretary determines that the circumstances justifying the EUA no longer exist or when there is a change in the approval status of the product such that an EUA is no longer needed.  \"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(2) [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=COVID-19&phase=2&map\\_cntry=US](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=COVID-19&phase=2&map_cntry=US) Dr. FAUCI recommended you all to go to [clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov)  . Dr. Fauci mentioned you need randomized clinical controlled trials to approve a drug for an intended use. Dr. Fauci said there is neither enough data to support nor deny the drug at this point in time. He has to say that because it is his job and Fauci cannot tell you the FDA will approve a drug before it has finished a phase 3 trial.\n\nIf you look at the link 17 out of 30. SEVENTEEN OUT OF THIRTY  phase 3 trials in the USA involve some combo of HC/Zpack. Guess how many Remdesivir had? (less than 5). Interesting enough if you look at the design of those Remdesivir trials  - [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04292730?cond=COVID-19&map\\_cntry=US&phase=2&draw=3&rank=21](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04292730?cond=COVID-19&map_cntry=US&phase=2&draw=3&rank=21) You will find that it is being compared to the \"Standard of Care\" Drug. WTF does that mean? What is the Standard of Care drug its being compared to? Well my guess would be HC lol.\n\n\\- Point (2) Fauci Said look up clinicaltrials.gov , if you actually did what he said you would see that 17 trials and over 10,000 people are being treated with HC right now.. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n(3) [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04308668?cond=COVID-19&map\\_cntry=US&phase=2&draw=2&rank=30](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04308668?cond=COVID-19&map_cntry=US&phase=2&draw=2&rank=30) I have read through all 30 current phase III trials and this is the closest one to finishing. If you see, Primary Completion date was April 21. 2020. Study completion date is May 12, 2020. \n\n\\- Point (3) Dr. Fauci said recently that we will soon have promising therapeutics. There is no other phase III trial even close to finishing before HC does. How can Fauci say that if none of the other 13/30 trials are even close to finishing? Well it's because HC is going to finally have clinical backing in randomized controlled trials in May.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: There was a EUA for HC, There are 17 clinical trials with HC as treatment in the USA involving over 10,000 patients, The first trial will be done May 12th. It will probably \"work\" all of a sudden.", "created_utc": 1587700841.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g71ivi/99_science_1_using_my_healthcare_trained_brain/", "is_self": true}
