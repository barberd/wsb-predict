{"id": "crklpe", "title": "How to Make Money in This DildoFest", "selftext": " \n\nAlright, so we all know that autism and taking green/red dildos right up the ass like a gay are directly correlated. We also know that a lot of you are losing stupid money in all this volatility when you should be making stupid money. YOU\u2019RE IN LUCK!!! I\u2019m here to show you just how you should have navigated through this parade of mangoes, chop sticks, and upside down airplanes. YAHHH, so if you had a high iq like President Trump, you would have seen some shit brewing heavy in the market mid july. Rate cut was already priced in, so you figure without a doubt July 31 would be a sell the news event heavy. Load up on like 10 otm spy puts a couple days prior, make some tendies, but then double down for the continuation. August 1, FUCK, big rally and you\u2019re now down back to where you were, but you hold because you\u2019re smarter than that and now Daddy Trump always comes in clutch with tariffs to save the day. Cash out those tendies heavy on Aug 2.\n\nFrom then on, OBVIOUSLY this market will be digesting the China issue for weeks to come, so the first week of August scale out and into puts in the mornings and then back in before close. This works pretty well, except for a few days when we rallied pretty hard, but thats to be expected, dont get all mad. You can\u2019t finesse everything 100% perfectly. Weekend before August 5th, hold puts heavy; fr, the likelihood of bad news dropping over the weekend and dropping the market vastly outweighs the chances of any good news. Aug 5 WELL DONE, mad tendies hooray, its LITTT, but your BIG dick energy is still throbbing so load back into puts before tuesday, UHOHHH now theres a flaming hot rally for the week, 6 points on the SPY thursday??? Fuccccckkk, your gains are a little fucked, but youve still doubled your portfolio since July. Now your autism fully understands that this great gaycession isnt going straight down, and you need to play a little better.\n\nAfter all that buffoonery, OBVIOUSLY there was something was up with bond yields. You\u2019d been watching that shit on the daily since mid may and noticed little by little that we were coming closer to inversion. Aug 13 tuesday, just 4 basis points away from inversion, this is it. Wednesday would be the day. Load up heavy on spy puts again and add some TLT calls. Great success. 100% return on investment. YOU\u2019RE A GENIUS LIKE LIL TUNECHI!! Naturally, after seeing such a rally after Aug 5 and learning from your big mistake, the same would happen the next day, but you never know. Roll over your puts expiration to end of August and significantly cut your delta in case of any great gayness. Then flatline thursday and rally friday, you lose a little, but its k, youve still made mad gains and got your hand in the cookie jars for next weeks wallstreet pride event.\n\nSo there you go!!!! If you learn from this guide and apply it into the next coming weeks, you might just maintain a flat P/L before you finally realize options are shit and get out before spending your student loans or your wife divorcing you..
