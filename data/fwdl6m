{"id": "fwdl6m", "title": "$DUST - tell me how this thing is not rigged, how is this thing alive???", "selftext": "TL;DR: the whole thing is the TL;DR version. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, have been following $DUST for a bit. Things are not great. It has been in the hole to the tune of -$30-$100MM (NOT A FRICKIN TYPO!!) for 10+ days now. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAside from being that deep in the hole, other tremendous things happening to it:\n\n\\- it has not been able to achieve exposure objectives on 3 of last, maybe, 15 trading days. thats coz it did not have the coin to buy the swaps it needed to do this. Deets at the end\n\n\\- fund management decided to change objective from 3\\* to 2\\* effective May 19th 2020. Then corona showed up and they decided to accelerate that to EOD March 31st 2020. But they remain in the red. Again, deets at the end.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDecided to track daily holdings on this thing to figure out when it would die starting about 2 weeks ago. Here is a summary of what they look like over that period with the 5 day Yahoo chart right under it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/QsAostk.png](https://i.imgur.com/QsAostk.png)   \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSee that red row at the bottom, thats holdings as of today. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1THOSE NUMBERS MAKE NO SENSE!!!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n$DUST WENT DOWN 10% TODAY SWAP HOLDINGS GO U \\~ $30MM. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTHAT IS SOME CRAZY $&@%  !!!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are probably thinking, yeah, whatevs! You have no idea what you are talking about here. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOK, lets drill into this a little bit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are holdings for the ETF categorized by type - Swaps, Treasuries and Cash for the same period\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/D2unhqD.png](https://i.imgur.com/D2unhqD.png)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat green column with the \"VANECK VECTORS GOLD MINERS ETF SWAP\" is where the funky stuff is happening.  Look at that last cell in darker green - $DUST goes down 10% and the swap gains 10%!!!! HOW?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis swap, which is designed SOLELY AND ONLY for the purposes of paying out when $DUST goes down, GAINED ALMOST $30MM IN VALUE TODAY WHEN $DUST WENT DOWN 10% \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust compare any daily chart since March 19th 2020 with the swap; when $DUST drops, the swap loses value the same ratio. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is simply not possible for the swap to go up when the ticker goes down. ITS' EXPRESS AND ONLY PURPOSE IS TO GO DOWN WHEN THE TICKER GOES DOWN! HOW DOES IT GAIN $30MM on 10% down day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd its not a payout (buyout??) of the swap with cash - there is a drop of \\~ $15MM in cash which simply moved from BoNY to Dreyfus. Its not the treasuries either, only about \\~$6MM of flows there, not enough to cover the $30MM\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpiuAqKDU\\_8&t=1m26s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpiuAqKDU_8&t=1m26s)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe ETF isn't shutting down! It won't die!!! ITS SWAPS MOVE UP ON DOWN DAYS!!! HOW!!!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHelp me believe that this game is not rigged.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLinks\n\n1.
