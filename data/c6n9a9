But here's my totally not retarded reason:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust talked to a senior sysadmin of a fairly large cluster. I asked if he was excited about using a Macs and asked if he ordered any. The answer:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"No you retard\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was a little surprised. In fact, they had actually just put in order for more PCs. Why? Because they use WINDOWS. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry guys, but APPL has NO chance. It's all smoke and mirrors which will come burins down in a few quarters when APPL, once again, will show no sustained revenue growth. Look at the quarterly revenue for the last 10 years. It's BALLS TO THE WALLS!! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAyyMD and Apple to the MOON! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c6lfwt/why\\_amd\\_will\\_fail/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c6lfwt/why_amd_will_fail/) )", "created_utc": 1561744116, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c6n9a9/why_aapl_will_fail/", "is_self": true}
