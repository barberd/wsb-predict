So beautiful I bought twice as much as I was thinking about.\n\nThen I looked at AOBC, liked the pattern and bought. \n\nThen I looked at VSTO and maybe lost my mind. The stock recently has a daily pattern of doing well in the morning (the \u201cdumb\u201d money?) and then tanking in the afternoon which is typically the smarter money. This is also the general direction of the stock. \n\nFor some reason I just went ahead and bought planning to sell soon, and maybe even short sell to hedge my industry exposure. Im familiar with these ideas I\u2019m blurting out, but never do this sort of thing. Just hoping someone would talk some sense into me. Probably selling momentarily.\n\nEdit has a nice support level, I\u2019m gonna set a stop loss and hold maybe", "created_utc": 1559064653, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bu2vhs/gun_company_charts/", "is_self": true}
