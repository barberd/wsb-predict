I was considering suicide if TSLA continues to run. I had almost heart attack when it reached 498, drank some Xanax and got chilled. Fortunately it was going down last two days. Although I lost some money it is not as substancial in comparison of margin call.  I will sell Naked calls on TSLA next week. I hate it so much, I dont care if Im gonna die by shorting it. I need to prove to myself that I can predict TSLA stock price and overbought shit is going down. \n\nActually I brokeeven on TSLA. I lost $20k on Amazon bull put spreads today. I literally forgot how falling stocks looks like and dip getting deeper. \n\nI cant post pictures because I have 0 care if you believe me.
