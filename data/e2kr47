{"id": "e2kr47", "title": "PTON short interest update", "selftext": "Nasdaq updated their mid month short data from PTON and it was wildly different than what many firms, including S3 (one of my favorites) estimated. short interest is just 27.6m on Nasdaq for PTON, for a 61% percentage of float short. They said short interest data from Nasdaq gets updated every two weeks and that is the official amount. \nBorrow rate is still just 5-7%. Almost nothing.\n\nThat being said, I like this name going into the holidays as it makes sense for a holiday present for rich people. Reminds me a bit of GPRO in holiday season of 2014- the stock went gang busters.\n\nFurthermore- they are doing well on google trends- I posted the chart a few days ago but it was taken down by the mods. I don\u2019t know why the post was taken down, considering it would have made people who read it money. Unless they kept the data for themselves? \ud83e\udd14 \n\nAnyway- I own a crap ton of Jan 2020 $35 calls and hope to retire to my own private island when this squeeze is done \ud83c\udf34  \ud83e\udd42 \ud83d\udc83", "created_utc": 1574880965, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e2kr47/pton_short_interest_update/", "is_self": true}
