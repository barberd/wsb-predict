{"id": "ezhk1i", "title": "WSB Hall Of Fame", "selftext": "Listen up autists! its a time for celebration\n\nif theres one thing that i respect more than anything it's a true wsb autist. i envy how a true autist can just casually hold 4.3m dollars in some hella volatile gainz bc hey, 4.3m is poor ppl money.. Only to get cucked, or doubted, or whatever by some vibe or something... I am wildly fascinated and vastly inferior to the autismo that racks up 200k in 100% illegal buying power just to get bent over by steve jobs stunt double.\n\ni want to be *that* autistic...i honestly do.......but my woman sized balls continue to hold me back...i can only strive to reach such great heights and get put on such a pedestal  (truly awful, i know)\n\nNOW TO THE FUCKING POINT and why i have gathered you all here today...we (more like I) HAVE to document the glory of our kings, WSBgod, 1r0nyman, ControlTheNarrative, and others in some sort of WSB Hall Of Fame... publicly displayed for your worshiping pleasure.\n\nI have taken it upon myself to purchase the domain [wsbhalloffame.com](https://wsbhalloffame.com) and will spin up a website as the medium in which our brothers can be celebrated. \n\nthis is where **YOU** come in. who should be included in this hall of fame? how does someone make it into this hall of fame? community vote? or should i take my new found domain and go fuck myself? which is coincidentally the nickname i gave to ur mom, \"myself\".\n\nanyway lmk bby k thx", "created_utc": 1580940849, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ezhk1i/wsb_hall_of_fame/", "is_self": true}
