{"id": "f5ipa4", "title": "SPCE Bears go away", "selftext": "There\u2019s a reason they only make spacesuits for humans and not bears. Humans are capable of logical thought, science, some of the finest poems and songs ever made, our entire society has been built by humans. Bears? Bears shit in the woods and don\u2019t even know how to read. As such there are NO bears in space, and never will be - so why would you listen to a bear talk about SPCE?\n\nWill SPCE see a dip this week after earnings? Probably. Will SPCE skyrocket when they announce a first flight date with Branson? Definitely. Will it go higher on pure hype in the run up to that launch? Yup. It jumped like 50 fucking percent because they moved the ship to the hangar - that was a small jump folks.\n\nIf SPCE drops 30% tomorrow it\u2019ll still be at it\u2019s all time high from before last week. But if you\u2019re gonna let some bear that can\u2019t even read talk you out of investing in the only publicly traded fucking spaceship company in the world that is months away from commercial launch then catch me waving from the moon.\n\nForget fundamentals, and logic, and careful guarded analysis \u2014 trust in the force and Darth Whitesides and Emperor Branson. We\u2019re in early on a stock that\u2019s literally going to send random rich people into space, ride the hype.", "created_utc": 1581985506, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f5ipa4/spce_bears_go_away/", "is_self": true}
