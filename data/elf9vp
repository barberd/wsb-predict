{"id": "elf9vp", "title": "Car fire in Norway Shut Down Airport - Parking Structure Collapse - Likely Caused by Electric Car - TSLA", "selftext": "This one is a lot of speculation, do with it what you will.\n\nSo there's a place in Norway called Stavanger that has some of the highest number of Teslas, and electric cars in general, on the road.  There's currently a fire in the airport parking lot that's burning out of control.  Unknown how the fire started, first tip said an electric car but unconfirmed, I'd speculate it could easily have been a Tesla.  This started at 3:30 Europe time, so it's been going over 3 hours and not expected to be in control anytime soon. \n\nThe person that reported the fire was 25 ft away when it started, says it started in a parked electric car.  5-10 minutes later it spread to other cars. \n\nThe fire is so bad that part of the 5-story parking structure has collapsed and the entire airport is shut down since all first responders are focused on the fire.  The Prime Minister of Norway was in Stavanger today and is forced to drive back to Oslo (\\~8 hours) because of it.  \n\nI don't see any English news on it yet.  It's still a bit of speculation, but could easily be heavy fall-out for old Musky and TSLA.  Doubt it would be a long-term hit, but could make some tendies on downies when word gets around.  Seems the algos don't read Norwegian.  \n\n [https://www.nrk.no/rogaland/biler-i-full-fyr-i-parkeringshuset-pa-stavanger-lufthavn-1.14850087](https://www.nrk.no/rogaland/biler-i-full-fyr-i-parkeringshuset-pa-stavanger-lufthavn-1.14850087)", "created_utc": 1578420878, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/elf9vp/car_fire_in_norway_shut_down_airport_parking/", "is_self": true}
