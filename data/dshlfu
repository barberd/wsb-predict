{"id": "dshlfu", "title": "ROBINHOOD IS FAKE", "selftext": "Given the recent events with margin being handed out at ridiculous ratios, my theory for Robinhood\u2019s real business model is slowly getting confirmed.\n\nTheory: Robinhood doesn\u2019t actually sell us shares of stocks or options or whatever you autist invest in. They just pretend to.\n\nIf you buy $300 of AMD and your position goes to $320, robinhood pays the difference. You don\u2019t actually buy or sell the stock, the price is just monitored.\n\nThis business model is more profitable because of all of you autists. You lose enough money to make ironyman jealous.\n\n\nProve me wrong", "created_utc": 1573053021, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dshlfu/robinhood_is_fake/", "is_self": true}
