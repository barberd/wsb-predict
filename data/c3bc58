{"id": "c3bc58", "title": "BYND Short Borrow Rates", "selftext": "In Calling around rates seem to be at 93% with no shares available to short. So same as yesterday afternoon. I'll update this post when S3 gets around to their daily rate update. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm still holding. It doesn't mean you should. But if you told me a large potential customer would take a pass on having BYND as a supplier (Taco Bell two days ago) and that CNBC would run an interview with someone claiming that BYND has dangerous chemicals in it (it doesn't) and the stock would be down less than 10% in those days, I'd say \"that's not so bad\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a reminder, I have mid August calls. So I have myself a bit of time for things to play out, and a bit of time value if I am wrong.", "created_utc": 1561127767, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c3bc58/bynd_short_borrow_rates/", "is_self": true}
