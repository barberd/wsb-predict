Unfortunately ended up losing money on it. \n\n**Account totals:** \n\nCash - 245 CAD or 184 USD\n\nOpen - 10900 CAD or 8216 USD\n\n**Total Equity:**\n\n11145 CAD or 8400 USD \n\n**Profit/Loss all time**\n\n+3254 USD\n\nGoal - 120k USD\n\n\n\nI'm only going to be updating on days I make plays so if I didn't post means I'm just holding the same positions. (or that I made a small insignificant trade). \n\nI got the 100k loan today in cash. Had to pay 20% up front like last time (so loan is 80k). Then knowing me I went to an underground poker place and lost about 8k right now. Paid my other loan shark back his 14k so now that that's taken care of my only debts are to this guy for 100k (20% interest due end of every month starting in March). \n\nHave around 70k in cash right now. Going to see my brother on Sunday to see if he will write me a cheque for it so I can deposit it in the bank and then fund my trading account by Tuesday-ish. \n\nIf not, just going to deposit the cash and say that I got it from a friend as a loan. Deal with the back lash of that with taxes later.", "created_utc": 1581746720, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f45gbg/day_14_of_100k_loan_from_loan_shark_63_ytd/", "is_self": true}
