Nintendo is also working with Microsoft, and both Sony &amp; Microsoft will use AMD hardware. Basically you will have a surface tablet that has Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo streaming services, each with their own massive library of exclusive titles. Nobody wants to have 3 different tablets.The recent consoles have been a loss for the companies that produce them as companies made their money with services and licenses, so rather than to take risks with individual tablets they will make Microsoft produce their tablets.Perhaps the  cross-platforms games will be sold on the Microsoft store since nobody wants to pay for the game 4 times.", "created_utc": 1559101318, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bu9tak/i_think_that_i_may_have_discovered_the_endgame_of/", "is_self": true}
