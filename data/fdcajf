Last week, three weeks ago, someone said AMD was going up, I got in and made some money. Shortly after, someone mentioned SPCE, (before it's big boom), made money there too. We haven't been getting much of those lately. They're still out there. Yesterday some guy posted gains on $NUGT... yet he never spoke of it. That would have been a great $GutFeeling call.", "created_utc": 1583324943, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fdcajf/calls_on_gutfeeling/", "is_self": true}
