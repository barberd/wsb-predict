Market cap of $175M.  They are probably going to go out of business... but also they might not, and will probably get bought just for their network technology and because they're so cheap.\n\nHere is their latest investor presentation:   [http://ir.gogoair.com/static-files/abf4df77-172a-45e8-8012-8a7faf6fa305](http://ir.gogoair.com/static-files/abf4df77-172a-45e8-8012-8a7faf6fa305) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey have like $200M in cash (more than mkt cap) and they have pushed out 80% of debt maturities to 2024.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways the Jan 2021 $1 (yes, $1) puts are bidding $0.25.  I'm going to write a lot of those.  Hopefully these guys are still a company by then.  You could also just buy equity outright but no one here does that as far as I know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor what it's worth Analyst PTs range from like $1-7.  The most recent ones (last week or two) have come in at $4 and $7.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for listening to my TED Talk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSincerely, \n\nFettywaap\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS - BAN ALL THREADS", "created_utc": 1590692583.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gscf2l/gogo_free_money_play_not_really_but_maybe_jan/", "is_self": true}
