{"id": "fp9s4q", "title": "Summary of Stimulus Relief Bill Benefits", "selftext": "$1,200 Checks \n\n- Individuals (non-dependent) will get between $600 and $1,200; couples get up to $2,400 (total); plus $500 per child (dependent). For example, a couple with two children can get up to $3,400.\n\n- Even those who don\u2019t pay income taxes and those on Social Security will get these checks.\n\n- Those who earn less than $2,500 will not get any check. Those who earn more than $2,500 and don\u2019t owe income tax will get $600. Those who earn more than $2,500 and do owe income tax will get $1,200. (I might not have all the details here.)\n\n- The only exception is those who earn more than $99,000 per year ($198,000 for a couple) who will not get anything. \u201cIncome\u201d is defined as AGI, adjusted gross income.\n\n- There\u2019s a phase-out from $75,000 \u2013 $99,999 where you\u2019ll get a smaller check. (math calculation here)\n\n- The $75,000 threshold = $150,000 for a couple filing jointly ($112,500 for a head-of-household)\n\n- Green card holders/permanent residents are classified will receive the stimulus. (according to reader\u2019s comment)\n\n- Payment is based on your prior tax return (2018 or 2019), but if you make too much in 2020 they money will be clawed back. (It\u2019s not clear whether they\u2019ll use your 2019 tax return only if you didn\u2019t file one in 2018 or if they\u2019ll use it as the most recent return even if you did file in 2018. The wording of the bill implies they\u2019ll only use your 2019 tax return if there is no 2018 tax return on file. That may or may not actually be what happens.)\n\n- (An oddity here is that if you made a lot of money in 2018/2019 you won\u2019t get a check, even if in 2020 you don\u2019t make any money. So they are clawing back for the citizen\u2019s detriment, but I haven\u2019t heard any mention of giving back for the citizen\u2019s benefit in the scenario that you made less money in 2020.)\nAccording to reader\u2019s comments, this check is not taxable, you keep all of it; you won\u2019t have to pay taxes on it like you do on other income.\n\n- Some suggest that the stimulus money will go to wherever your last federal tax refund went; if you got a check you\u2019ll get a check, if you got a direct deposit it\u2019ll be sent to that bank.\n\nUnemployment Benefits\n\n- Provides enhanced unemployment benefits for 4 months. This increases your unemployment check by $600/week, on top of what the state regularly gives, for 4 months. Someone can potentially get their full salary amount after being fired, with no \u2018pay cut\u2019, depending on what your salary was\n\n- Extends unemployment 13 weeks longer than usual rules. Most states offer 26 weeks, and that will now be 39 weeks. (This kicks in back from January 27.)\n\n- Extends unemployment to self-employed workers as well. That would include gig workers like Uber drivers. (I assume these workers will file for unemployment through the regular state unemployment website/office, but I\u2019m not certain of this.)\n\n- Extends unemployment to furloughed employees as well. The added goal here is that businesses should not fire employees, instead leave them on as furloughed.\n\nSmall Business Loans\n\n- This fund is for loans of up to $10M to companies of 500 employees or fewer. Businesses who pledge to keep their workers can take a loan from the government, with the eventual forgiveness of the loan if they continue to pay their employees. I\u2019m sketchy on the details here, but it sounds like you can get forgiveness on the loan for 8 weeks worth of payroll, mortgage interest, and rent costs.\n\n$2T List\n- $250B for direct payments/checks to individuals and families. (see above)\n\n- $367B for small business loans. (see above)\n\n- $250B to boost unemployment insurance benefits. (see above)\n\n- $500B in loans for distressed companies. $75B of this is earmarked for airlines and travel.\n\n- $130B in funding for hospitals and medical equipment.\n\n- $150B in funding for state and local governments.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\n- Payroll taxes for 2020 can be deferred.\n\n- Most federal student loans borrowers will have payments and interest deferred until September 30. Also, for popular loan forgiveness programs, like PSLF, borrowers will get credit for payments during deferment period.", "created_utc": 1585221340.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fp9s4q/summary_of_stimulus_relief_bill_benefits/", "is_self": true}
