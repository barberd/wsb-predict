We conquer. Get plowed from time to time but we\u2019re entertaining and that\u2019s what life is all about. \n\nI saw this post on personalfinance where this guy had 20k sitting around to invest and the people were telling him to put 10k in a fucking Ally Savings account with 2.1% interest or some shit and 10k in an index fund\n\nHow cucked can you possibly be? At least buy fucking Microsoft or amazon or something. Index funds and savings accounts and IRA\u2019s is all they ever say over there and I\u2019ve had it. \n\nI revel in the warm embrace of WSB\u2019s pursuit of huge gains, at the expense of devastating losses. It keeps life interesting. Couldn\u2019t imagine laying on my deathbed of the most affordable nursing home in Arkansas with my used camry outside knowing I never took one risk or did anything interesting with my money. Just put it in a goddamn savings account and told my wife that there will be major gains in 50 years, while she\u2019s fucking the mailman because at least that guy can be fun and spontaneous. I\u2019d rather die without a penny to my name than live my life like that.", "created_utc": 1562562104, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cagrmb/why_is_rpersonalfinance_so_cucked/", "is_self": true}
