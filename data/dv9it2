{"id": "dv9it2", "title": "How do I make a better and bigger cucumber?", "selftext": "So hear me out guys. My cucumber is about 2.00 inches erect but I need at least 5.00 inches for Friday. Don't ask me why but I need it. Furthermore, my girth is about 3.50 inches in circumference +/- 0.5 inches because depending on when I measure I could be breathing in or out. I need this to go to at least 5.00 inches. Finally, my Robinhood app on my phone is only $500. I need it to show at least $5k by Friday. Don't ask me why again, but it's necessary. \n\nMy question is how can I increase the size of my cucumber as well as &gt;$5k in my RH app?
