{"id": "g1ejue", "title": "Anyone ever notice everyone does what everyone else says they are doing and they are always wrong?", "selftext": "I know I am new, but I have been entertained by the degeneracy levels on WSB for a long time. I am a long time fan and observer until I decided to make an account for my YOLO play of the century. I had to share it and see it I am right, because if I am, this will be the largest decline in wealth and quality of life in human history (partially because we are up so high, is life hard right now?). \n\nI noticed everyone lose their ass in February because Goldman said we are \u201crecession proof.\u201d And everyone was buying Tesla calls at $1000. Even on the run this past couple weeks, $1000 looks stupid. \n\nThen boom, we have the sharpest decline in a hundred years. The mortgage industry is hampered permanently overnight (still not fixed, getting worse) and now no mortgage servicer is getting anywhere near the money expected for months... and that\u2019s just the residential real estate side. \n\nThe mortgage bond market is even more fucked than in 2007 (hence JPM cutting all Fannie and Ginnie loans) because the bond market is the biggest cluster fuck (remember the synthetic CDOs) they are all going to zero 1/3 of all mortgages were at least 30 days late on their mortgage BEFORE lockdown. Hence the emergency don\u2019t report mortgage lates and credit scores in the bill. If those bonds go to 8% foreclosures as AAA rated bonds have very low failure rates the bond becomes worthless. The bets made on these worthless bonds were 50x that of the bond market. \n\nOil, unemployment, bankruptcy, small business... \nI could go on and on and SPY drops like a fucking rock right before the people at the top (see senators under investigation for selling off early) you guys are now letting a false trail bull run take you off the economics and the value of things. \n\nIf Boeing is struggling, Tesla can\u2019t be worth 2 Boeing\u2019s. 1+1=\ud83d\udc1f forever. \n\nMore layoffs or coming, the virus is worse than everyone thought.\n\nIn February everyone was googling recession and now they are buying SPY calls after one of the best runs up ever. \n\nGuys, the S&P can\u2019t be that unstable. It makes no sense to be that volatile. That\u2019s a signal that\u2019s the market is changing, after a 12 year bull run, on a 100 year run up from the Depression bull run, you guys are buying puts. The odds we have a major correction in the next 3-4 months downward vs up is comically scary on the downside. \n\nJPM cuts all mortgage business, reports 70% profit decline, goes down, and you guys are buying ZOOM and SPY calls. \n\nI would start looking at doing the opposite and set your expirations out later. The first market tremor was in 2007 but the market didn\u2019t get to a low until 2008.\n\nWe watch history and look at historical charts until someone on you tube in a hoodie tells us to buy ZOOM up 300% since IPO on margin because how could zoom go down in value up 300%? Lol\n\nHeads on a swivel, remember millions of \u201cday traders\u201d  traders just got their stimulus.... and your surprised the full tard growth hot stocks are on the moon? Banks aren\u2019t lending to companies might make money in this future. \n\nBe smart, look out for a big ole bear on the next correction (whenever it is) we are only able to lower rates to 0.00 so much. May be tomorrow, may be in a month or two, but the decline from up at the top of a 100 year bull run isn\u2019t good for anyone. \n\nBe safe. \n\nMike Hancho", "created_utc": 1586900578.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1ejue/anyone_ever_notice_everyone_does_what_everyone/", "is_self": true}
