What they're trying to do is save fallen angels. Specifically, the policy is to \"expand its bond-buying program to include debt that was investment-grade rated as of March 22 but was later downgraded to no lower than BB-, or three levels into high yield.\"\n\nSource:https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-09/fed-unleashes-fresh-steps-for-as-much-as-2-3-trillion-in-aid\n\nA good example of this would be a company like Ford.
