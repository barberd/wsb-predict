Details inside.", "selftext": "I didnt want to Ask /r/personalfinance because, well do I even need to explain that?\n\nMy friend has a shit line of credit. (Probably because he is black and has a very african name if were going to be honest) but he has a great job in IT making somewhere around $90-$105K based on what Ive gathered from him. and he has a degree in a (not to be too specific) certain field of Engineering. He is not a dumbass and I trust him. \n\nIf youre wondering why he doesnt have the line of credit to start this if he has such a good job, Im not sure, but I assume its because of his college loans and because he doesnt have much money saved up because he has a gambling problem. (so do I and so do all of you so that isnt really an issue Im just explaining why he doesnt have $25K+ saved up on his own)\n\nI wont have to worry about the gambling problem because he will not have access to this line of credit at the casino. \n\nHe needs $25,000 line of credit to start an automated drop shipping business through someone he has known for a few years now and Ive looked into enough that Im willing to take the gamble on this automation shit and I trust my friend to do what is neccessary to be successful once he is started.\n\nI made the proposition of him Giving me $10K cash up front and I give him the $25K line of credit.\n\n My Questions for WSB are...\n\n1. Should I ask for a percentage ownership of his store and profits? If so, what percentage do you think would be a good deal since I am taking a lot of risk on him and essentially acting as a hard money lender.\n\n2. What is the best way to set up this line of credit while legally protecting myself from as much liability as possible? \n\n2. Can I just pay a banker to set this deal up for me?\n\n4. Sorry for my ignorance but my business college didnt actually teach me how to make money. \n", "created_utc": 1552959722, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b2r821/my_friend_has_shit_credit_but_needs_a_25000_line/", "is_self": true}
