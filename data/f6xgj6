{"id": "f6xgj6", "title": "For those asking, since I called some good moves this morning... my current positions for options now are: RAD, ODP, LL, and still in ACM and CARG. Lottos: TGT earnings", "selftext": "  \nDouble or nothing post, right?\n  \nRAD.  Earnings are coming.  Premium coming into the calls.  Look at March 20's and April 30's.\n  \nODP.  Turnaround story here, just like RAD.  Premium coming into them now, but check out the March 3 calls.  They're still cheap.  (I probably won't hold these through earnings.  Been burned before.  But I'll sell half day before earnings and hold the other half, or maybe 1/4)\n  \nACM.  Haven't sold a single piece.  Not selling.  Will sit on this for weeks if I have to.  Plenty of time on those March 50's and 55 strikes.\n  \nCARG.  Also haven't sold.  Think it's going to gap fill to $30-$35 next week.\n\nLL.  Good shit.  Just continues printing tendies.  Huge volume.  $12 is coming.\n  \nALLY.  March 30 strike calls paying the bills.  Nice sweep on those today, too.\n  \n\n  \nFun lotto I took today that may work if premium shows up:\n  \nTGT 140 strike for March (monthly contract).  They're like .18 cents, guys.\n  \nPENN 39 strike call for TOMORROW.  Does it work?  Probably not.  Flip a coin.  Large volume there though, and news out.\n    \nSEC DISCLOSURE:  THIS IS A FUN MEME POST IT'S NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE I JUST LIKE POINTING OUT THINGS I SEE IN THE MARKET.\n  \n**NO REASON TO RISK YOUR ENTIRE PORTFOLIO ON STUFF LIKE THIS.  5% OF YOUR PORTFOLIO IS ENOUGH FOR 5x GAINS**", "created_utc": 1582223832, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/", "is_self": true}
