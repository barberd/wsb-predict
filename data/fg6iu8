{"id": "fg6iu8", "title": "ATVI DD - Non-Retarded Edition", "selftext": "Yesterday, some bumblefuck posted DD for ATVI calls. I won't even insult you by linking it, because despite being 10 paragraphs long, the life-shitter failed to mention the single solitary thing that will give ATVI massive lift this week: their new free-to-play battle royale game (Warzone).\n\nNow you're probably thinking: \"so what tard? developers announce games all the time. it's priced into their pipeline\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\nThe best way to explain this is to look back at EA last year when they did exactly what ATVI is doing now in stealth-dropping a F2P BR game: [https://i.imgur.com/VpoStWU.png](https://i.imgur.com/VpoStWU.png)\n\nThe fact that EA had a bad earnings report the day after launching the BR mode is unfortunate, but it further illustrates how impactful F2P BR games can be on valuation. The new game, Apex, represented an entire stream of cash flows that had not yet been baked into anyone's models. Not only that, but the game was heavily thought to be the \"Fortnite-killer\" in its first week, and as we all know, Fortnite literally prints tendies. +22% from game launch in the first 10 days speaks for itself.\n\nThis leads us to today. ATVI just announced Warzone, a F2P BR game that *also* leverages the popular-with-kids-in-their-30s brand Call of Duty. There's not a single analyst whose model incorporates the profitability of Warzone into their valuation. Not one. The game will officially launch tomorrow, dominate on Twitch, and reignite talks of there being another Fortnite-killer. The analysts will then wake up, run the numbers, and realize: \"Holy Powell, there's another 20-30% upside in this whore!\"\n\nSo why am I sharing this? Very simple: I entered and I want to make money. I'm up 50k this year, thanks to you autismos, so I don't mind sharing this, and again, it helps me by getting me to higher profits faster (I'd get there anyway, but now this way you beat the smarmy fucks on the street).\n\nTL;DR: ATVI Calls, strike: $59-60, exp: 3/13. Follow my lead for high tendies and to avoid terrible spreads in further OTM calls.\n\nPS: Additional rough DD, using worst through best case scenario revenue and income based on currently estimated competitor rev/income: [https://i.imgur.com/o4t8002.png](https://i.imgur.com/o4t8002.png)\n\nEdit: About to post positions from mobile, please hold.\n\nEdit 2: Positions: [https://i.imgur.com/VHwVeKX.png](https://i.imgur.com/VHwVeKX.png)", "created_utc": 1583806452.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fg6iu8/atvi_dd_nonretarded_edition/", "is_self": true}
