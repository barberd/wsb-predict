{"id": "ei584f", "title": "How do we feel about Tencent?", "selftext": "There are a lot of draws for me with Tencent, especially the fact that they have diversified their offerings so much, but the real interest I have is in WeChat. Literally everyone in China has it and needs it not only to message their friends and family, but also to pay for just about anything. China is virtually cashless and WeChat pay is the only method to pay for goods and services which means they have a stranglehold on the population. I like the idea of the company having guaranteed winning product offerings like WeChat in their portfolio which gives them the ability to expand and take risks with other offerings like cloud, AI, etc but I am curious to get your guys\u2019 opinion on the company and hear from people who have considered buying the stock or who currently own it and why.", "created_utc": 1577810489, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ei584f/how_do_we_feel_about_tencent/", "is_self": true}
