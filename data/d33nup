I honestly didn't know this (or forgot) until this round of earnings, but the start date is Oct. 17 for drinks and edibles. Hexo has been sitting on the Molson Coors deal for some time. No matter what happens with earnings tomorrow I think they can bounce on this news alone. \n* Hexo financials look good for the size of the company. Cost of revenue/operating losses are shrinking, they have cash flow, they aren't overextended like the big boys. \n* Big believer in trading one step ahead of \"stoner psychology\". Hexo has been on a steady decline with the rest of the industry despite the amount of pumping they attempted last spring, so I'm convinced it'll have some pissed-off stoner fuel behind it\n* Snapchat\n\n [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HEXO/balance-sheet?p=HEXO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HEXO/balance-sheet?p=HEXO)  [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HEXO/balance-sheet?p=HEXO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HEXO/balance-sheet?p=HEXO)", "created_utc": 1568268427, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d33nup/hexo_earnings_dd_wsbinfused/", "is_self": true}
