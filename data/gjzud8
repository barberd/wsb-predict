Position - 6/05 $134 Calls\n\nTL;DR/RECAP - Similar to others in the space (ATVI) who had tremendous gains prior to and through earnings, I see TTWO both with strong short and long term potential. \n\n[Take 2 Games](https://www.take2games.com/) \\- TTWO (Take- Two Interactive Software) develops/publishes some of the most recognized games for consumers worldwide. This list includes GTA, 2K (Sports) and many other successful game lines.\n\nMarket - TTWO is in the center of the global gaming market, leading it as it keeps growing from year to year. Previous companies who lead the market have shown strong resilience during these times and have had tremendous gains throughout earnings.\n\nFinancials - TTWO short term assets are more than enough to cover long term debt signaling a strong financial position. TTWO have also payed a huge chunk of their debt during 2017 and have held a very low debt model.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?", "created_utc": 1589506388.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gjzud8/ttwo_earnings_coming_up_discussion/", "is_self": true}
