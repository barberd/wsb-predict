{"id": "g79nb2", "title": "Crude oil investment possibilities", "selftext": "Hi guys.I'm quite a newbie and am trying to learn about investing for long term gains.However, if I'm honest the current oil situation does create a strong FOMO in me and I think I need to do something about it with a part of my cash, but I'm confused about what exactly.\n\nI don't care about volatility and can hold whatever I'm buying for a few years, so my only concern is I don't want the investment to go bust.\n\nI stay away from futures and I saw that some oil etfs were already taken off the market (I guess you lose all your money if this happens?).So what would be an aggressive way to try to take advantage of this that is relatively safe?  I saw these two tickers but I'm not sure if other than volatility they can go to 0: WisdomTree WTI Crude Oil (CRUD) and Bloomberg WTI Crude Oil TR (BCOMCLTR).What do you think?I know what I'm planning is aggressive and normally not advised for newbies. But I have a good amount of cash that I can play with right now. Worst case if the investment goes bad I can make it back quite quickly.\n\nMy risk tolerance is high but don't want to invest into something that has a very high chance of going to 0. I have no issue if it loses 90% of the value temporarily though.\n\nThank you so much in advance.\n\nPS: I know ideally I should first be more prepared on the subject before making such bold moves, however, this situation is historical and I don't think it will happen again quickly, that's why I'm ready to take more risks than I normally would.", "created_utc": 1587739617.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g79nb2/crude_oil_investment_possibilities/", "is_self": true}
