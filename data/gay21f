Now I'm back with a even juicier one.\n\nOil will recover when the economy opens up no matter what. The price of oil plunged due to the lack of demand. Once the economy opens back up, even if you don't have the money to spend on a new car, you would still pay for gas to get groceries.\n\nOil is essential in the year of 2020, regardless how soon TSLA is going to replace gasoline cars.\n\nNatural gas mooned because it is used to generate electricity. Oil is next when people have to go back to their jobs. With all fundamentals pointing back to oil, like even airlines run on oil, shipping vessels run on oil, there's no need to chase after travel industry when you can capitalize on the foundation of all industries. \n\nThere are calls on MRO, XOM... But I want to bring your attention to a really undervalued one. What's the fun of an increase from 6 dollar back to 13 in MRO, 8 dollar back to 12 on ET when you can have 4 dollar back to 13 in the near future.\n\nRegardless of any looming mortagage defaults, car loan defaults, you can rest assure oil is going back to  Feb level while REIT might lead the plunge later. \n\nSSL is brought to my attention on my PBR post. They are currently trading at a P/E ratio of 4. They normally trade at a P/E of 15 without Coronavirus.\n\n7.5C 6/19", "created_utc": 1588261362.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gay21f/round_1_et_round_2_pbr_round_3_ssl/", "is_self": true}
