In case you didn\u2019t know, they extended their cruise reopening from July to September ([https://www.marketwatch.com/story/norwegian-stock-plunges-after-cruises-put-on-hold-through-september-2020-06-16](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/norwegian-stock-plunges-after-cruises-put-on-hold-through-september-2020-06-16)).\n\nBefore Covid, NCLH was becoming a best unto its own, reporting in its most recent pre-Covid filing that not only did it jack up prices, but it booked at a 7% higher rate. People were in love with this shit. So it is resilient.\n\n***What happened:***\n\nNCLH dropped this bomb in AH. NCLH Stock dropped correspondingly in AH, down 12%, and dragging travel down with it (UAL down 2%ish after hours, CCL down almost 8%, other airlines dipping as well). This is an opportunity to get in on some weeklies, 6/26 for shooooo and 6/19 if SPY cooperates.\n\n***Let\u2019s look at some comparable instances of notable dips to see how NCLH responds:***\n\nSimilar events since COVID have shown that even after a steep decline, on the MOST bearish of news, NCLH always stops the skid within two days (one, really) and has a climb of at LEAST 7% within a 3 day span afterwards. Also, when it tanks, it doesn\u2019t continue on and on\u2014day 1 is always the biggest drop, and the subsequent days are not very consequential drops as the public buys back in.\n\n*Comparative instance 1, May 5th-7th*\n\nMay 5th\u2014 A Monday AFTER the weekend Buffett says he\u2019s pulling out of airlines (for those who don\u2019t really follow this shit, airline and cruise generally move together as a \u201ctravel\u201d package). On May 5th they ALSO announce THAT THEY MAY GO BANKRUPT. That\u2019s literally as bad as it can get for them, right? They drop 22.5%\n\nMay 6th\u2014 They raise capital like superstars, step up they liquidity game, and only end up down like .5% on the second day of aftermath.\n\n(Comparatively, during this two day span, airlines had gone down between 5 and 8% because of Buffett and the NCLH news. CCL, its cruise counterpart, dropped 8% on the NCLH bankruptcy news.)\n\nTheir resilience was incredible, On May 7th, they ended up 7.3% from the previous day, and on May 8th went up another 3.4%. That\u2019s a 50% recovery from the Tuesday drop by the end of the week.\n\n*Comparative instance 2, May 28th- June 1st*\n\nOn May 28th, NCLH dropped 10% (it was a bad market day, 100k deaths and Brazil news), and the following day, a Friday, it dropped another 2.5%. That Monday, June 1, it jumped another 9.4%.\n\nBy direct comparison CCL went up 6.3% that weekend. By market comparison SPY gapped up a weak .36% that weekend (it has less volatile swings than NCLH, obviously, but I still consider that thoroughly outperforming. Demonstrates NCLH can moon over SPY in its recoveries.\n\n*Comparative instance 3, last week\u2019s Mini crash*\n\nSince June 12th, the day after the Thursday rash, NCLH is up 18% as of close today, before the news release. Pretty good bounce back, I'd say. Fits the M.O.\n\n(To be 100% fair, it had been on a two day dip leading into Thursday, it was more sensitive to Wednesday\u2019s hearing from the jump than others.\n\n*What is clearly demonstrated through looking at their previous moment after big dips*\n\n1. NCLH is capable of outperforming SPY immediately after a dip. There are even more instances of this, just not as pronounced as my examples\n2. NCLH always makes up serious ground, swiftly, from a sharp decline\n3. The WORST news the business could have, impending bankruptcy (before bankruptcy was bullish) was priced in at 22.5%. They gained 50% back within two days. We know their channel bottom, and we know how they recover from it.\n\n*How to price the bottom tomorrow*\n\nAlways tricky. If it opened at 10% or more down, I\u2019d probably just pick up my calls then and not gamble with retard strength rally. BUT, we have the fed hearing tomorrow, so I will stick around to see if any more damage can be done and stomach the morning pump, which will probably include NCLH, that will come before Powell speaks.\n\n*Conclusion*\n\nNCLH 6/26 21c\n\nRetail loves em, MM loves em, they got room to run.", "created_utc": 1592364594.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/haj5fx/playing_nclh_postponement_for_max_tendies_this/", "is_self": true}
