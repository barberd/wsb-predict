{"id": "bmg0ul", "title": "Stupid question on Index Futures (UVXY and VIX)", "selftext": "I was reading up on the  [u/1R0NYMAN](https://www.reddit.com/u/1R0NYMAN) situation and learning about UVXY and how it works.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand that things like the SPVIXSTR and VIX are indexes and are theoretical portfolios that can't be traded directly (too hard to keep the same portfolio mix that updates all the time? idk). So if you can't trade it, how does it have futures? that confuses me.\n\nAlso, UVXY tracks the SPVIXSTR at 1.5x leverage which represents VIX futures in a rolling one month position. Why track SPVIXSTR at 1.5x and not just have UVXY track VIX itself at 1.5x, seems to just be adding to the confusion by throwing in another index.\n\nAlso, while looking everything up I read about the Contango theory, from the few articles/videos ive read they are mentioning how people are willing to pay higher than what the expected spot price for a future so they don't have to deal with the material goods. But when the Futures are based off of indexes and theres no material goods what is the decay from? Theta? EFT inventory fees?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Now that I'm thinking about it why does Futures on the VIX have less volatility than the VIX itself? Makes no sense\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReally all this shit is confusing as hell IDK how anyone fully comprehends all this. So if I'm understanding everything right then   [u/1R0NYMAN](https://www.reddit.com/u/1R0NYMAN) was buying a derivative of a derivative of an index of a derivative of an index of a derivative of an index composed of stock? some inception level shit.  Please dont tell me theres an index that tracks UVXY futures and a subsequent EFT that tracks that LOL.", "created_utc": 1557381585, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bmg0ul/stupid_question_on_index_futures_uvxy_and_vix/", "is_self": true}
