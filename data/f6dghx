I bought some March 20 $75 calls for an earnings YOLO which slowly depreciated as the stock tanked 3-4% in the following days after purchase.\n\nI was just about to sell those calls at a 20% loss yesterday when some Unusual Options Activity happened in SHAK calls. The stock has pumped 4% since and my calls are now ITM and +20%.\n\nI really like hamburgers so I might add to my calls for a run-up into earnings.\n\n*Not financial advice.", "created_utc": 1582131037, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6dghx/shak_earnings_yolo_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
