I was in GameStop today browsing through all the t-shirts and other garbage wondering how they planned to avoid going bankrupt. That's when I saw a woman burst through the door and proclaim that her son had to have the Super Mario mushroom stuffy.

People like this will save the company!", "created_utc": 1576436303, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eb2xn4/gamestop_bankruptcy_is_cancelled/", "is_self": true}
