{"id": "g34swx", "title": "Clarifying data on gilead/remdesivir", "selftext": "I\u2019ve seen so many retarded posts about this from so many people who don\u2019t understand how medical research works so I just wanted to clarify the data we have and what it does and doesn\u2019t mean. \n\nAs a disclaimer I made a shit ton of money from calls today but I sold them all this morning so I have no vested interest right now but will probably jump back in after it dips because I\u2019m optimistic about the drug. Having said that, the retardedness is coming from both the bull and bear side. Y\u2019all motherfuckers need to learn how to read and interpret a medical study. \n\nTo begin there\u2019s a couple different types of data each with different levels of reliability. \n\nThe most well-known and the kind that produces the best and most useable data is randomized controlled trial (RCT). This is the gold standard. There are multiple RCTs ongoing to study remdesivir right now. The multiple RCTs will measure the effectiveness in different groups of patients. They have a trial looking at \u201cseverely ill\u201d patients and trials looking at milder illnesses. If this drug works it may work only for mildly ill patients or it may only work for severely ill patients or it may work to different degrees in both groups. We won\u2019t know with confidence until after the RCTs are completed.\n\nA second type of data we can get is a case series, which is a lesser quality of data, but it is quicker to publish and is still data nonetheless. It is basically \u201cwe did x intervention. This is what happened\u201d. Nothing more and nothing less. It is dangerous to make sweeping generalizations or draw strong conclusions from this data, but it is still data nonetheless. This is the NEJM article that was published recently that you heard about which talks about the outcomes of severely ill patients after being given remdesivir as a compassionate use. \n\nLastly we have anecdotal, unverified data. This is what came out last night. It was presented as if it was a case series, but really it was a recording of some people talking...take this as you would any other recording of people talking. Maybe it\u2019s true maybe it\u2019s not; either way it doesn\u2019t give us the whole picture and is missing large amounts of data. \n\nThere\u2019s many different types of data and trial design in addition to these, but those aren\u2019t necessarily relevant right now. \n\nSo, having introduced these concepts let\u2019s look at some common retarded talking points about all this data:\n\n1) \u201cGilead published shit data. It\u2019s useless. There\u2019s not even a control group and it\u2019s a small number of patients. It\u2019s just a pump\u201d\n\nThis was a case series. It was not designed to be an RCT and never should be interpreted as such. It\u2019s like saying \u201cthis dog sucks. It doesn\u2019t fetch balls. It just shits in a litter box, climbs trees, and meows\u201d. So, yes, no shit there\u2019s no control arm and it wasn\u2019t randomized or blinded; that wasn\u2019t the intent retards. This was literally just a paper saying \u201cthese are our initial patient outcomes\u201d. So why publish this at all? If this were any other time I\u2019d say it would be irresponsible for a company to publish this data since we can\u2019t draw statistical conclusions; but these are unprecedented times and this was published a month before any RCT data will begin to come out. One could make the argument that, in times like these, any data is better than no data. Maybe that\u2019s an incorrect viewpoint, but many people don\u2019t see it that way. Keep in mind this was published in the most prestigious medical journal in the world, so at least some people who know things about medicine and statistics thought it was worth publishing, but I\u2019m sorry that it doesn\u2019t meet the caliber expected by the Walmart greeters on Reddit. Taken at face value, the outcomes of the patients who got the drug were quite good, but we don\u2019t know if those statistics will hold up over different groups and additional studies. \n\n2) \u201cthe NEJM study reported 25% rate of adverse events including hypotension, multi-system failure, renal failure, and liver failure. This drug is unsafe!\u201d\n\nThese are all known complications of covid and, in general, critically ill people from any cause. This study was specifically done on patients who were classified as critically ill, so they were extremely susceptible to these known complications anyway.  It turns out that, when you\u2019re dying, your organs begin to fail... Really ground breaking concept here. There are multiple case series reporting rates of complications in covid patients that can be found with a simple google search. Reported rates in patients not treated with remdesivir are broadly similar, but the reported ranges vary wildly (https://bestpractice.bmj.com/topics/en-us/3000168/complications). \n\nIt is impossible to know from this data whether the drug causes increased or decreased rates of these complications. Determining that would require an RCT, which will be forthcoming soon. \n\n3) \u201cthe mortality rate in the NEJM study was significantly lower than the reported fatality rate in critically ill patients not treated with the drug\u201d \n\nThis is the biggest takeaway that I see people get wrong. You can\u2019t compare the statistics of two different studies for multiple reasons including 1) inclusion criteria of what a critically ill patient is will vary between studies; this means you would be comparing apples and oranges 2) even if inclusion criteria were the same, patients do better in some hospitals than others; maybe the standard of care is slightly better, maybe the nurses at hospital A are more attentive than at hospital B, etc. 3) there is no blinding so there is ample opportunity for implicit and explicit bias. These factors are all negated by randomization, which is why we need an RCT to determine if it is actually effective. \n\n4) \u201cChina stopped their studies which means they weren\u2019t working. This drug is going to fail\u201d\n\nThey were reportedly stopped due to low enrollment. This may mean that the patients were meeting exclusion criteria ( these are used to reduce variables the data. For example if you are taking other experimental or herbal treatments you may be excluded from being able to participate in the study). But nobody in the general public know for sure why they had low enrollment.  Ultimately, only China and possibly gilead actually know why they stopped the trials. You could make up both bull and bear arguments, but at this point either way you look at it is just conjecture. The cancelling of these trials is pretty neutral to me for those reasons. \n\n5) \u201cgilead released a statement saying that the leaked audio from STAT does not constitute reliable data\u201d\n\nThis is true and was a good statement to make. This is all unverified data and is both unreliable and essentially useless. Doesn\u2019t add to the bull or bear thesis for me, but you can take from it what you want. The politics and optics of releasing a statement like this are beyond my scope of my expertise and I think you can spin it any way you want.  \n\nOverall, I\u2019m optimistic about this drug but obviously no statistical conclusions can be drawn and nobody knows for sure if it will be successful given the data that we do have. I can elaborate why if people are interested but that wasn\u2019t the purpose of this post. The purpose of this post was to point out how retarded everyone is about medical literature and statistics so that maybe you can wade through the bullshit and make a more informed decision for yourself. \n\nTL;DR buy TSLA 1,000 calls.", "created_utc": 1587139358.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g34swx/clarifying_data_on_gileadremdesivir/", "is_self": true}
