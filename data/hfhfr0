UPDATE #2", "selftext": "For those of you looking for an update on FLIR.\n\nSee original post here: [FLIR: The only COVID-19 play that hasn't been played out.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/heln3e/flir_dd_the_only_covid19_play_that_hasnt_been/)\n\n\nI bought more calls. \n\nAt market open, FLIR skyrocketed and was actually up 2% at one point before selling off in the mass market crash the rest of the day. Very unfortunate that the momentum was killed, or I think it would have had a massive spike otherwise. It went vertical in the morning, literally like a meme stock. Unfortunate that the momentum was killed by broader market condition, but I'm still holding because the core ideas of my post are still valid. Resistance is still intact, and FLIR outperformed the market significantly throughout the day. Calls are actually up 40% today even in this mass market selloff. That means more people are willing to take a risk on it than SPY. \n\nI took this as an opportunity to add to my call position. I bought some higher strike July 45cs in addition to my 40c. Options are a teeny bit more expensive than yesterday, but that happens when market makers start to see potential in a stock. The same thing happened to Tesla, MRNA, and INO before they skyrocketed. Frankly, I think this might be the next big trend because there's no other solution to COVID in America anymore. We can't have another shutdown, and the people refuse to wear masks. Just to even make people feel safe, every business is going to want a thermal camera to show that they're \"Safe\". \n\nThere was some great discussion in the previous thread.
