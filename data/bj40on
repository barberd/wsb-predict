Negatives for Intel include: CPU IPC has been largely stagnant for the past FOUR years. For those not familiar, IPC is Instructions Per Clock. It has nothing to do with the number of CPU cores, or the speed of a chip, and is entirely about how many instructions are executed per clock cycle. So a 2.0GHz chip with ah higher IPC will perform better than a 2.0GHz chip with a lower IPC. If the clock speeds increase, performance will go up, but newer chips with the same IPC won't be any faster when running at that 2.0GHz speed.\n\nWith Inte, 10nm being delayed itself would just mean that clock speeds won't go up, but a lack of any IPC improvements show that Intel is not improving the design of its chips well enough. So, what has Intel been doing over the past FOUR years where IPC hasn't improved? Intel finally improved the thermal interface material for better cooling of the chip itself(under the cover), so you see some speed increases, but there were already enthusiasts who were removing the lid from the chip to do this improvement themselves;, and the results has shown that the chips themselves have not really been improved, the news chips have better assembly.\n\nSo, AMD....When AMD first launched Ryzen in 2017, many people were surprised, if not shocked. Not only did AMD release 8 core chips(while Intel had stayed with 4 core chips) in the consumer space, but the new Zen core design was fairly competitive on an IPC basis as well. This allowed AMD to be every competitive with their new chips, and the only advantage that Intel had was a slight advantage in IPC, as well as high clock speeds. AMD offering double the number of cores did make Ryzen a very competitive product in most areas. Since that time, AMD boosted the IPC from first to second generation, as well as providing a bit better clock speed. Looking forward, the third generation Ryzen chips are expected in the next months (announcement and specs due on May 27th), with a 13-15% IPC improvement over second generation, and potentially a jump of 20% in clock speeds. Yes, this is a 20% boost on top of the 13-15% performance boost even at the previous speeds, so you can see how big of a jump this is expected to be, depending on clock speeds.\n\nAMD isn't stagnant in IPC, isn't stagnant in clock speeds, and may even double the core counts to 16 cores in consumer grade chips. This is why things look very promising for AMD in the second half of 2019. Intel isn't expected to have 10nm desktop chips ready before 2021 at this point, so that is why those who understand the technology see so much potential for AMD right now. AMD has at the very least, a year where it will be well ahead of Intel. Q1 and Q2 are the periods before the new chips are released, and many are waiting to buy the new chips, so a slowdown in sales SHOULD be expected.\n\n***TLDR - SU BAE WILL GIVE US THE GOODS IN THE SECOND HALF***\n\n**SHORT TERM** 5/3 $29/28.5P  \n**LONG TERM** 11/15 $28C", "created_utc": 1556634869, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bj40on/amd_q1_2019_predictions_plays/", "is_self": true}
