{"id": "gtx30a", "title": "Uber is up over 21% ytd and here is why, other businesses should really take note on how to prosper in an evolving world:", "selftext": "Times have changed and Uber is now at the forefront of human ingenuity. People no longer leave their toilet paper castles for fear that the drive thru worker will make fun of them for not having a designer n95 chin strap. As a result of this voluntary sheltering, people have began ordering their food to their house and ~~Doordash~~, ~~grubhub~~, ~~postmates~~, (oh shit sorry, i had to scroll to the bottom of the search results) UBER, is the place to turn when you want your food brought to you. Uber dominates the food delivery market, one of the most profitable sectors in the world, and this has translated into some major profitability! Their q1 earnings beat the expected negative one billion dollars by over three times that with an astonishing three billion in losses. Uber's massive profits of negative one billion dollars a month so far this year haven't gone to waste either; they have gone right back into the company's infrastructure to even further increase their value. Uber has expanded their geographical footprint to no longer include several countries, the corporate staff has been increased by negative 25%, and they've even been un-opening several branches all across the US. While these areas of negative growth are impressive, the most valuable expansion has been in their legal department. Uber is not only a food delivery service now, it is also a law firm hiring agency. Uber is taking on multiple state governments and thousands of their own ~~employees~~ non-employees as part of an outreach program to help educate their non-employees about joblessness and the judicial system. This ex-ride sharing service has really shown how businesses should evolve over time. Uber has avoided the mistakes of other businesses like the taxi companies that never figured out how to bypass paying workers and the need for special licenses, or Lyft, that only focused on cutting losses and maintaining their core business amidst a global pandemic. Uber has truly gone above and beyond these companies of the past to become one of the best investment opportunities in the world.", "created_utc": 1590922534.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gtx30a/uber_is_up_over_21_ytd_and_here_is_why_other/", "is_self": true}
