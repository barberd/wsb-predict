{"id": "d041mn", "title": "[Serious, mostly] How can one be a trader and maintain their compassion, empathy, and kindness their fellow human beings?", "selftext": "Today I was irritated that my call credit spreads (a bearish strategy, for the uninitiated) on BMA, an Argentinian bank were in a loss. I was irritated that the Argentian economy hadn't collapsed further because if it did, I'd stand to pocket some extra dough. However, since I have a decently long expiry I am sitting comfortable on this trade: I am feeling content that the Argentinian economy will not recover, and BMAs rally is superficial.\n\nEssentially, the further collapse of a country's economy will trigger cash flow and a dopamine rush, which is making me doubt my character. But don't get me wrong: as long as I have money, I will trade, and if I stand to make money when economies crumble, I'll do it. I'll just feel shame when the dopamine wears off.\n\nTo counter this coldness I've adopted, I've tried to be a good son to my parents by helping them with everything, and I work as a dog walker/sitter where I help typically older people that co no longer walk their dogs like they used to, which makes feel kinda good for a short time.\n\nBut still, it doesn't shake this apathetic coldness I've adopted. Will more altruistic deeds lift me out of the darkness or will I need to bear more responsibility so I can create more meaning in my life beyond betting on human suffering to occur?\n\nI don't think buying my girlfriend's husband a Nintendo Switch would make me feel like a wholly good person: gotta do more than that.\n\nAll jokes aside, what is r/wallstreetbets 's thoughts on the matter? What do you do to retain your humanity in such a cold-blooded world?", "created_utc": 1567705130, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d041mn/serious_mostly_how_can_one_be_a_trader_and/", "is_self": true}
