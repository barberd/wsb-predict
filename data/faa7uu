Market cap of around $100 Billion. Apple could acquire them at let's say a 50% premium in an all cash deal (maybe some shares but shares = bad right now). If Apple was to own the corona virus cure, they could charge a huge premium and make all their money back. They could charge the price of a $1,000 a vaccine comparable to their iPhone prices, and make all their money back in 5 minutes from the acquisition. They could also do yearly revisions of the vaccine like maybe packing a flu shot deal in with it and charging an extra $200 Year over year.\n\nBasically, AAPL $420 if cure acquired", "created_utc": 1582799782, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/faa7uu/should_apple_acquire_a_pharmaceutical_company/", "is_self": true}
