It was $72 in 2018 doesn't mean you should go and buy it. Hertz was $20 six months ago, you're not buying that right? Bankruptcy is diluting the stock and it could be worse than we expected. Buy stock, don't buy calls until it shows any signs of life. Better yet, buy something else. Every week there are 3-4 posts on PCG and after losing my 6/19 calls on this, I have little hope for my 9/18 calls. If the stock was really a shoe-in for $30, why aren't hedge funds and tutes buying? Tutes are buying at $10.50 from the bankruptcy, now its $9.97", "created_utc": 1592856631.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hdzsog/for_the_love_of_all_that_is_good_no_more_pcg_dd/", "is_self": true}
