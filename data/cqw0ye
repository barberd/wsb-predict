I have been learning about investing / trading for about 15 years, but never really put any of my knowledge to use until a year or so ago. One of the biggest and best tips I've learned in my journey is to keep a trading journal. That way you can go back and see what you were thinking on previous trades to get better on your next ones. \n\nI found this subreddit a few weeks ago and think it's a great resource to get trade ideas, so I have created a new Reddit account that I will use primarily as my trading journal. As you can see from my RH account, I'm not a pro by any means, but I'm committed to getting better and making trading an additional source of business outside what I do for a living. \n\nEarly this year I made some pretty bad trades going negative on the market when it started to rise and didn't stick to my trading rules that I will put below, which resulted in huge losses. The last 3 months I've been on a nice little run as I've been more methodical in my trading (close to 11k up over 3 months). I've also cashed out more than 50% of my account after my run so now I'm playing with half my money and half my money (looking to cash out the remaining funds I put in and play fully on the house on my next run). \n\nHere are some additional trading rules I've learned over the years that when followed allows you to make money and limit losses:\n\n1. The name of the game is the preservation of capital. You'll be good as long as you can limit large losses. Sell out as soon as you show losses on options of 30% - 50%. After that, you're trading on hope, and hope isn't a trading strategy.\n2. The trend is your friend (buy calls when stocks are on the uptrend, buy puts when stocks are on the downtrend)\n3. If you buy out of the money, you're destined to be out of money.\n4. Always have target prices for where you will exit your position BEFORE you get into the position (a target price to sell for profit, a stop loss to sell for a loss). Your trading journal will help you keep up with this.\n5. Make sure you keep into consideration the industry group your stock is in as well as the market overall. I follow DIA, QQQ and SPY for market direction and XLP, XLY, XLB, XLC, XLE, XLF, XLI, XLU, XLV, XLK for industry direction.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease comment your experience with trading journals and add any rules I may have missed. I'll also add additional trading rules as they come to me and if I see any really good ones in the comments, I'll add them as well.\n\nI'm hoping my Reddit trading journal will keep me accountable to myself and the group to make sure I stick to my trading rules. I think it would be great if others followed my lead and start trading journals themselves (off or on Reddit).
