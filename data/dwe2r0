{"id": "dwe2r0", "title": "ZS / IRBT / UBER - \"EXPERTS\" Please read this", "selftext": "Ight so i started this strategy where i use the weekly chart to find pivot points in a chart , i find my entry with a 180 4 hr , 30 d i hr and ultimately i add on sells off on the 15 min chart following trendlines \n\nfor example : ZS a couple weeks a go when i bounced off $40 . i started buying calls expiring over 60+ days away.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nit's been working out so far the only downside is you obviously going to see you account go red for several days but overall on the month you come out green\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy stop is below the previous low so if it goes against me i know when to get out for a pretty small loss \n\nI seem to be to inpatient about taking profits tho..\n\nBought TSLA before it took off using the same strategy- sold when i saw my profit at 1000 lol that was my first 1k day so yea i took that 1k .. Left probably another 5? idk -my calls would still be active with 30 + days \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBought UNH as well , same fucking story. bought on that beautiful pinbar on 10/03 Sold a couple days later for a beautiful profit that made my account grow dramatically ... now it running around fucking all time highs hhahahahaha FUCK \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso my issue is patience. Does anyone (WITH EXPERIENCE) have any tips on what to do so i don't close out my positions so early in the move ? my calls so far have been pretty fucking spot on, Deff long term traders 2-3 months \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was thinking maybe to actively trading futures, i seem to be more relaxed when i do so and honestly been doing it at night and been profitable but since i trade minis (Due to account size) the moves aren't big enough to make it worth my sleep  i. my goal is to have enough to get a full contract , a small correction on a selloff is definitely something i'm excited to experience .\n\nI know i need to get a lot more disciplined and it's a process but does anyone see anything wrong with this strategy ? anything i can adjust to make it more profitable ?", "created_utc": 1573758071, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dwe2r0/zs_irbt_uber_experts_please_read_this/", "is_self": true}
