Over the last 3 months though, my hands showed their weakness, I lost about 5k and just closed my position.  Coming into this week I was actually sitting on a few grand in spite puts.  This Tuesday, my gf (knows absolutely nothing about stocks except through conversations with me) asked me what I was going to do with all my fat gains and I just kinda blankly stared at her and said WAT?  She procedes to explain that she saw that Elon Musk had gone off twitter which clearly meant he was trolling and trying to bait shorts (this no doubt was her logical conclusion after hearing me banter about Tesla for the last 2 years).  I looked at her and said... you are completely right... \\*and then I sold my puts, flipped to FD calls and made some cash\\* lmfao, I am so done trading for the year.", "created_utc": 1571926199, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dmgxwe/tesla_last_minute_flip_flop_for_the_win/", "is_self": true}
