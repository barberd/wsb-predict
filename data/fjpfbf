{"id": "fjpfbf", "title": "PSA to any sad fucks who sold JNUG this morning", "selftext": "Listen up folks, we all know that the action in gold miners has been total bullshit the past 10 days. There's no way a mere 7% gold drop should cause a 50% drop in (non leveraged in case you autistic brothers don't recognize the ticker) GDX/GDXJ. Let me tell you why the dip and rip today isn't just some temporary spike like the morning dildos in SPY, and that large cap gold companies like GOLD/NEM/RGLD are now HUGE buys. \n\n1) **SELLOFF IS IRRATIONAL LIQUIDATION:** As far as I can tell the drops are Just liquidation, margin calls, people and 'tutes selling what they can to plug their bleeding assholes from autistic \"stonks only go up\" insanity of the Trump pump presidency. This has nothing to do with the profitability of gold mining companies, all these big players are literally making 50% profit margin on gold right now with all in sustaining costs of $800-1000 and realized costs on the world market of 1500 or higher. These guys are selling stocks with P/E and EV/EBITA ratios 2-3 times below that of the S&P \\[1\\] (yes, this is AFTER the S&P's PE has dropped to a \"mere\" 18.79 from the mid upper 20s.) Now selling fundamentally inexpensive assets to cover your retarded bets on fundamentally expensive assets must be the highlight of any fund manager's ignominious career in the trump era. DON'T DO IT. \n\n2) **CRASHING ENERGY COSTS:** the ongoing CRASH in oil is going to make costs even lower for these miners. Mining is a capital cost intensive business, and fuel makes up 10-25% of the cash costs of mining gold per ounce. Imagine what happens to profitability when up to a fourth of their cash costs goes down by half this year. IT WILL GO UP. That's more than can be said for almost any other sector in 2020. \\[2\\]\n\n3) **BEER VIRUS PROTECTION:** Virus FUD is not going to significantly effect mining operations.  Their administrative offices ensconced in safe chad offices in Vancouver, BC may be shut down, but they will keep mining gold and making BIG BOY gains. These large cap miners are diversified geographically (GOLD for instance has 8 operations, with 10+ exploration projects across 5 continents) and have had experience battling outbreaks already in god-forsaken places like rural Latin America, Africa and have already dealt with outbreaks of deadlier viruses such as Ebola and Zika. \\[3\\]\n\n4) **FINANCIAL HEALTH:** in the past, healthy finances and gold companies were like a bad joke. Companies were notorious for issuing huge amounts of debt, which depressed equity prices even as gold bottomed in 2015. Now, due to a complete abandonment of the mining/energy sectors by financiers, these miners have had trials by fire to reduce debt through RESPONSIBLE management. To use GOLD as an example again, it is a 28 billion dollar company that has only 2.4 billion in current liabilities, with 3.3 billion in cash, and earnings of 8.8 billion last year. Furthermore, its EV/EBITA is hovering around 4.5 \\[4\\], (compare to FCX, one of the biggest base metal miners at 11, or SPY sitting at \\~12+), which is beyond historically low. Any way you slice it the numbers indicate this is a great situation to be in for a company in a capital intensive industry. \n\n5) **GOLD PRICE:** I am sure even the most retarded in here don't think gold is going to go down with all of the world's central banks on the cusp of negative nominal rates, let alone real rates, entire industries literally going out of business and unemployment poised to rise in every 1st world economy thanks to all this responsible \"social distancing\" policy. All indications are that physical gold supplies are only going to dwindle going forward, with gold reserves already scarce before 2020 \\[5\\], and unprecedented demand only forecasted to rise even more \\[6,7\\]. yes check the source. your friendly deep state government IS MASSIVE LONGING gold, alongside your average timmy \"investor\" buying silver coins. \n\nI challenge anyone here to come up with a sector that is actually going to GROW earnings this year. I am counting on it personally. \n\n**TLDR: Do what Buffet swore never to do \\[8\\] (buy gold or gold equities), AND BUY THIS DIP IN  PARTICULAR, FAGGOT.** \n\nP.S. I am not as retarded as most of you folks so I am long 50 1/21 GOLD 22.00 calls among other shit, proof here:  [https://imgur.com/a/NeAYmxO](https://imgur.com/a/NeAYmxO) \n\nSources:\n\n\\[1\\] [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ETGrp2IWAAAyn8\\_?format=jpg&name=medium](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ETGrp2IWAAAyn8_?format=jpg&name=medium)\n\n\\[2\\] [https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/7/12/saupload\\_Screen\\_Shot\\_2018-07-10\\_at\\_12.23.24\\_PM.png](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/7/12/saupload_Screen_Shot_2018-07-10_at_12.23.24_PM.png)\n\n\\[3\\]  [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-barrick-gold/barrick-stockpiling-supplies-as-mining-industry-braces-for-coronavirus-idUSKBN20T1GJ](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-barrick-gold/barrick-stockpiling-supplies-as-mining-industry-braces-for-coronavirus-idUSKBN20T1GJ) \n\n\\[4\\]  [https://www.gurufocus.com/term/ev2ebitda/GOLD/EV-to-EBITDA/Randgold-Resources-Ltd](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/ev2ebitda/GOLD/EV-to-EBITDA/Randgold-Resources-Ltd) \n\n\\[5\\]  [https://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/news/warren-buffett-bashes-gold-2019-2-1027977003](https://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/news/warren-buffett-bashes-gold-2019-2-1027977003) \n\n\\[5\\] [https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/dc10f4b92a777d246f3c2c66098cd1c1?width=650](https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/dc10f4b92a777d246f3c2c66098cd1c1?width=650)\n\n\\[6\\] [https://www.kitco.com/news/2019-01-31/images/chart.png](https://www.kitco.com/news/2019-01-31/images/chart.png)\n\n\\[7\\]  [https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/coronavirus/card/u4qjZDrkGuuPLxl29J38](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/coronavirus/card/u4qjZDrkGuuPLxl29J38) \n\n\\[8\\]  [https://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/news/warren-buffett-bashes-gold-2019-2-1027977003](https://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/news/warren-buffett-bashes-gold-2019-2-1027977003)", "created_utc": 1584382168.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjpfbf/psa_to_any_sad_fucks_who_sold_jnug_this_morning/", "is_self": true}
