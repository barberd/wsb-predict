Saw beervirus supply chain impact on businesses coming back in early Feb, right around when I found WSB, so I was early to the \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b party and made some tendies on $SWKS puts. Why didn't you fucks tell me SPY/TQQQ were a thing from the get-go? Could have been soooo much richer. Fuck y'all.\n\nAnyway, I come here today not to admonish you for me not knowing basic shit, but to deliver some excellent news for humanity, and sad DD for us gay bears: \n\n# Beervirus may be about to slow down. Hard.\n\nMy sources are two-fold: 1) Nobel laureate Michael Levitt, and 2) the last couple days worth of report coronavirus data.\n\n# The prognostications of a biophysicist:\n\nSo Michael Levitt is a some smart fuck with like four different passports (probably for tax evasion, idk) who knows some stuff about biology and applied statistics, so much in fact that some other smart fucks from Sweden gave him a million $ and a plaque telling him how smart he is. Anyway, Prof. Levitt has been running the media circuit talking how he predicted a major slowdown in coronavirus case figures by looking at data coming out of China back in February, accurately calling the final case count and fatality number in Wuhan. The guy has no background in epidemiology. He just looking at rates of immunity and historical growth data and did a purely technical analysis (more on why this may be insufficient later).\n\n[https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3800632,00.html](https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3800632,00.html) \n\n[https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/prevention-cures/489415-nobel-laureate-predicts-us-will-experience](https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/prevention-cures/489415-nobel-laureate-predicts-us-will-experience)\n\n[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/coronavirus-michael-levitt-china-italy-a9422986.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/coronavirus-michael-levitt-china-italy-a9422986.html) \n\nSo reading through the articles, the guy is basically saying he thinks the response to the virus is overblown, and it will burn itself out much faster than most other models predict.\n\n# $RONA chart TA:\n\nSo with this in mind, let's check out Worldometer's case numbers/trends for the 'Murica.\n\n  \n\n\n[ERMAHGERD. ERXPERNERNCHURL GRURTH](https://preview.redd.it/44f306dagtp41.png?width=903&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5ebbe2c066e76c6ec2b4acb698afe2e5f50c7f9)\n\n Scary, right? But let's look at the log scale growth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Damn y u so curvy tho?](https://preview.redd.it/ydya64mmgtp41.png?width=927&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a741e73e161cca390830f7b678a46b56a92e440)\n\nSee that curve down starting to form over the last week? This suggest the virus is actually decelerating, and at the current pace, could flatten out in as little as two weeks. TWO WEEKS.\n\nStill don't believe me? ANOTHER FUCKING GRAPH FOR YOU.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Batman, is that you?](https://preview.redd.it/9p2c4tmmhtp41.png?width=893&format=png&auto=webp&s=3dbe0ae61593d30e553928c77e3a65fb3ce75cbd)\n\nLook at the envelope on daily new cases in the US. It's practically a head an shoulders. Puts on $RONA.\n\n# Limitations of the Levitt analysis:\n\nSo Levitt is looking purely at raw dater and pure maffema'ics when he was making his analysis, and is admittedly not an expert in epidemiology. In other words, he's not doing fundamental analysis. Let's look at some dates, shall we? February 7th was the date that Levitt observed the downward impulse start to manifest in Wuhan's infection numbers. What happened ten days before? The fucking lockdown. In other words, there were fewer new cases within the gestation period of the virus when the virus had access to fewer fresh hosts. Now we see the same trend occurring in the US, whose numbers are being driven mostly by New York. What happened in New York ten days ago? Yep! It's another lockdown. Or lockdown lite as the case may be, but people have been largely compliant with shelter in place as New Yorkers hate each other for the most part and are perfectly happy to avoid public life completely if they can justify not going to the office.\n\nNow New York is still in the early days of this thing and much of Levitt's prognosis is predicated on the fact that China's dataset is a month or two ahead of ours and they are reporting almost no (no?) new cases. There are a couple risks here applying the China data to US $RONA futures. First is that, by all accounts, China has been controlling new growth in Wuhan/Hubei by strict quarantine enforcement and mass surveillance which includes facial scans and temperature checks through a number of modalities. There is currently no such enforcement infrastructure in place in the US. Also, we still don't know if the CCP is just fucking lying to everyone to restore confidence in their market and workforce.\n\n# Interpretations:\n\nSo how should we interpret this one guy's opinion and a week's worth of bullish case data? How the fuck should I know? Stop asking so many questions. Jesus. Go read Investopedia or something.\n\nBut, in all seriousness, there are fundamentally two ways of interpreting this.\n\n\ud83d\udc02:  \"Oh shit, this Levitt dude says RONA bubble gonna pop! Load up on faggy D calls boys, SPY gonna bounce to the \ud83c\udf19! I-shaped recovery!\"\n\n\ud83d\udc3b: \"Levitt is full of shit, China is full of shit, my wife's boyfriend is full of shit, everyone is full of shit. Puts on everything. Either a million people die because Donny sends everyone back to work early, or quarantine until the virus is dead and we plunge into the next depression or JPow turns our currency into Monopoly: Zimbabwe Edition play money.\"\n\n# \"Fuck your wall of text. Do you even have a point here? POSITIONS OR BAN!\"\n\nJesus man, I was just getting to that. Calm your tits.\n\nI'm currently holding SPY 220p/210p 5/15, EWJ 45p 5/15, and DIS 95p 5/15. I may dump everything though ('cept maybe DIS) as I'm starting to think we'll see continued infection declines in the current hot zones and, barring any new locales popping off in a big way, a concomitant slow rally in index stocks as shelter in place orders are held through April. We may however end up seeing another swell in infections later in the year, maybe late May to June timeframe as people return to community life and the handful of latent asymptomatic cases starts to seed the uninfected population anew.\n\nTL;DR: Rally may very well continue through May. But we might be in for a nasty spike in infections later in the year. Maybe buy some calls in the meantime, idk.", "created_utc": 1585581177.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frskgo/bearish_trend_in_rona_charts_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
