Considering that there are approximately 4,000 people per square mile in Wuhan  (density) we can assume that the infected rate will rise dramatically. \n\n\u2022  **Protestors in Hong Kong burned down a quarantine facility.**\n\n\u2022 (Unconfirmed) Reports that there are more than 90k are infected in Wuhan. This wouldn't be surprising considering the central governments response to the SARS outbreak in 2003 where they intentionally tried to hide the initial outbreak from the World Health Organizations. \n\u2022 56 confirmed dead in China. Mainly the elderly/ people with a weakened immune system. \n\u2022  Confirmed cases in Canada, US, France, Australia, Japan, Malaysia, Nepal, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, and South Korea. \n\n\n\nSo probably not the end of the world, but a possible hiccup in the roaring 20's.", "created_utc": 1580078713, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eueed0/the_novel_coronavirus_is_probably_a_bigger_issue/", "is_self": true}
