{"id": "gadfxs", "title": "$USNA Executives' Selling Stock", "selftext": "*\\*Had to remove links so it doesn't get auto-blocked\\**\n\nYo! \n\nFor those that haven't read out stuff before, we wrote a tool that analyzes every single Form 4 filed each day to find \"unusual\" insider buying and selling activity (and sometimes we post the findings on here).\n\nToday, we find a company with a substantial amount of \u201cunusual\u201d selling activity by executives. Surprisingly, there aren\u2019t any obvious negative indicators that would give us hints as to why the executives sold. In fact, they recently beat earnings and returned to their previous high before the coronavirus.\n\nWith all of this seemingly good news, why would the executives be selling?\n\n# USANA Health Sciences ($USNA) - Insider Selling\n\nFrom Yahoo Finance:\n\n>USANA Health Sciences, Inc. develops, manufactures, and sells science-based nutritional and personal care products.\n\nUSANA has actually weathered the Coronavirus storm quite well and already made a full recovery.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1femrgxnisv41.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e445ed96cf1cb2d427ff4cb068098c4cfe2ade3\n\nUSANA\u2019s recent Form 4 activity shows that a number of executives and directors sold a substantial amount of stock. We even see the Chief Legal Officer, Chief Scientific Officer, and a Director sell 100% of their stock (at least in the accounts tracked on these Form 4s). However, it is worth noting that neither the CEO, CFO, nor COO have done any selling so far.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s0zlb57pisv41.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=c62bb4c766f09018ed19c0865b3c25306b0e656f\n\nTaking a look at the President\u2019s individual [Form 4](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/896264/000117911020005143/xslF345X03/edgar.xml), it shows no explanation for the sale of the stock (same with the others). This is very unusual as Executive\u2019s selling stock is almost always part of a 10b5-1 plan or for tax purposes.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r6lagl9qisv41.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=cfd283b3db7284f5d743e8b877b82c10d0905bde\n\nThings get even more interesting if we dive into some of these executives\u2019 previous stock selling history. Looking at the President\u2019s previous sales of stock, you will see that all of his previous sales (code \u2018S\u2019 on the form) are accompanied by a code \u2018M\u2019 for the same amount. The code \u2018M\u2019 is the \u201cexercise or conversion of derivative security exempted pursuant to Rule 16b-3.\u201d This essentially means that he is exercising some derivative security (\u2018M\u2019) and then turning around and selling it (\u2018S\u2019).\n\n*Below: on February 7th and 10th, the President exercised/converted his derivative securities and then sold them. However, he still held on to 8,095 shares.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wp4r76irisv41.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=a47dcdb8405144b54c5c5bd0702d48d391788fac\n\n*Below: On September 7th and 10th of 2018, he exercised/converted his derivative securities and then sold them all for \\~$125. The stock then fell to under $60 over the next 9 months.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3has8hksisv41.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e1b56b5bf6920927c4ddaba4fb0feb4abf5fa98\n\n*Below: On August 21st, 22nd, and 23rd of 2017, he exercised/converted his derivative securities and then sold them all for \\~$59. The stock then fell to under $57 over the next 30 days before shooting up to all-time highs of $125 over the next 13 months.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/byqfc0mtisv41.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=57a5a7b7cc13892a82a031c785f297d4aa2e3063\n\nHis April 24th sale is the first time we see him sell stock without also exercising/converting derivates at the same time. It appears that the stock he is selling on the 24th is stock he received by exercising some derivatives in February of 2019 that he never sold.\n\nIf you look at any of the previous Form 4s for the other executives that sold stock, you will notice that they follow a similar pattern. They generally exercise their derivatives and then sell them all. For some reason, in February 2019 they exercised derivatives but didn\u2019t sell any of the stock. Then in February of this year, they exercised their derivatives and sold the shares they exercised but never sold the stock from February 2019. They then rode out the coronavirus crash and sold their remaining shares when the stock recovered back to a local high.\n\n**There are three things that are unusual here:**\n\n1. Why didn\u2019t they sell the stock that they exercised in 2019 when the stock was over $100 and on the downswing (it eventually fell to below $60)? These executives always sell their stock after exercising it and this was near the highest the stock had ever been. It makes a lot of sense to sell at this point especially since they did sell *all* of their stock at the end of 2018 when the stock price was in the $120s. Were they hoping that the stock would turn around and go back into the $120s? Were they not selling on the downswing so that there wouldn\u2019t be any negative public sentiment about \u201cUSANA executives selling shares while their stock price tumbles\u201d?\n2. When they exercised stock in February of this year, why did they sell the stock they exercised in 2020, but not any of the stock they exercised in 2019 even though the stock was again at a local high (>$80 when it had fallen below $60 about 8 months earlier)? Were they still waiting for the price to get back into the $100s?\n3. Why are they now selling their shares when the stock is on the upswing and back to the highest it has been (\\~$84) since the end of 2018? Are they worried about the economy over the next few months? Do they believe the stock is going to tumble again? Or are they just done riding the rollercoaster that their 2019 shares have been on?\n\nOne last note, they also have their annual shareholder meeting coming up on May 1st to discuss the items in their Proxy Statement. There is a possibility that there is some negative news that will come out during that meeting, but the Proxy Statement doesn\u2019t mention anything particularly concerning.", "created_utc": 1588180721.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gadfxs/usna_executives_selling_stock/", "is_self": true}
