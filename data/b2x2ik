{"id": "b2x2ik", "title": "What\u2019s your move with FDX?", "selftext": "FedEx (FDX) delivers packages and freight a a global network of customers. The company\u2019s main business segments include FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx freight, and FedEx services. FedEx Express makes up 57.4% of revenue, but only 45.2% of operating income. This segment credits itself as the largest express transportation company in the world, reaching over 220 countries and territories. FedEx Ground is responsible for 29.2% of top line, which converts to 45.7% of operating income. This segment delivers to US and Canadian businesses, and can reach 100% of continental US residents. FedEx freight earns 10.8% of revenue, and includes freight services of any length. FedEx services controls 2.6% of revenue, and includes various business services to support the company\u2019s transportation services. The business currently trades at a price to earnings ratio of 10.4x, representing a 29.12% discount to the company\u2019s 1 year average multiple of 14.8x. The main reasons for the selloff is slower integration with the TNT Express acquisition, slowdowns in global economies, and competition from Amazon, which as explained below, is completely overblown. \n\nFDX acquired TNT Express, an air and delivery services company, providing FDX with exposure to a deep European and Asian network. In FY\u201917, FDX announced a profit improvement goal of TNT of $1.2B to $1.5B between 2017 and 2020. In the company\u2019s 2Q\u201919 earnings release, management noted this goal would not be reached, but still provided positive news regarding the integration process. At the time of the 2Q\u201919 call, 70% of the global sales force had been integrated, and the freight products and specialty services segments are growing rapidly. One reason for failing to miss the profit improvement target is a cyber attack the company faced in 2017. The Petya attack cost FDX $300mm in earnings, but since this attack was a one-time event that was not a result of weak business, I don\u2019t think it deserves to damage the market value of FDX. Another reason for investor worries around this integration are high integration program expenses of $1.5B through 2020, which will include $450mm in FY\u201919. FDX is utilizing productivity-enhancing tools (bots, analytics, AI, etc.) to reduce the number of staff positions needed between the FDX and TNT. These high integration costs will likely be the last FDX has to pay, and they might decrease depending on the amount of positions cut. Finally, the global growth slowdown is a likely reason for the lower confidence in the business, which is explained more below. \n\n    Another reason for the extremely discounted P/E multiple is from concerns around the recent global economic slowdown. There is no denying the economic uncertainty economies around the world have been facing. Brexit has created economic uncertainty in the UK, Eurozone growth slowed from 2.5% in 2017 to under 2% in 1H\u201918, emerging Asian growth has slowed from 6% in 2017 to 5.6% in 2Q\u201918, world trade grew 3.5% in 2Q\u201918, compared with 5.3% growth in the same period a year earlier. Italy and Germany are dealing with slowing GDP, and the entire global economy has dealt with the trade tensions between the US and China. International revenue makes up ~33.4% of revenue, so does FXD deserve to trade at a lower multiple? Sure. But does this justify a nearly 30% discount? I don\u2019t think so. The segment most exposed to international revenue is the FedEx Express segment, which is made up of 56.4% international revenue. Even with the global political slowdown, this segment\u2019s revenue grew 5.8% in 2Q\u201918 compared to the same period a year earlier. This segment has also grown at a 1.4% compounded quarterly growth rate, showing there is still financial strength amid slowing demand. Investors also overlooked the other three segments, which have seen tremendous strength from a strong US economy, and make up over half of the company\u2019s revenue. This growth was fueled from a 4.9% increase in General Rate Increases (GRI) for the Ground and Express segments, and a 5.9% GRI increase in the company's Freight segment. Overall I think the global economic slowdown justifies a declining P/E multiple, but not a decline as large as what FDX experienced. \n\n    Another reason for the discounted multiple is competition from Amazon, who has expressed interest to enter the logistics business. AMZN announced a 50 plane expansion to its Amazon Air fleet, and a $1.5B operating hub scheduled to open in Kentucky in 2021 with capacity for 100 planes. The company already handles 26% of its shipment centers and 185 fulfillment centers, and some analysts think its recent growth plans will cut into FDX\u2019s market share. I think it is a ridiculous claim to compare AMZN as a legitimate competitor to FDX, and does not warrant a declined multiple. FDX recently stated AMZN accounted for less than 1.3% of calendar 2018 revenue, and is not a significant threat. Additionally, FDX\u2019s history is made up of a series of purchases and acquisitions to build one of the most intricate global networks. If anyone thinks AMZN becomes a serious competitor when why buy a few planes and open 1 operating hub, they\u2019re simply crazy. AMZN will not be a significant competitor in the short run, and any uncertainty around this news is completely overblown. \n\n    FDX is also implementing multiple initiatives to insure its multiple trades back to fair value. FDX announced FedEx Extra Hours, a service that delivers products after regular operating hours for next day delivery and local two day deliveries. Customers already include  AutoZone and Best Buy, with plans to expand to more retailers. The company is growing FedEx OnSite, a service that allows customers and FDX associates to pick up and drop off packages through a retail outlet. This service is available at over 12,000 retail locations, including 8,900 Walgreens stores, helping the company utilize the growing e-commerce market to attract customers. I am also confident FDX\u2019s large market share, increasing efficiency measures, expanding operations, and strong financial history will help it retain its customer base and growing sales. \n\n    For 3Q\u201918, analysts are expecting adjusted EPS of $3.14, representing a (15.6%) YoY decline. This value has been revised downward by (1.64%) in the last four weeks. Revenue is expected to come in a $17.7B, accounting for a 6.9% (nice) YoY increase. My overall consensus is that FDX\u2019s multiple was unfairly sold off in 2018, and I would buy calls long term. For earnings after the bell on Tuesday (3/16), this is a literal bet. I think investors will focus on management guidance for the integration with TNT Express, and see how financials have been impacted from the global slowdown. Since the stock is trading at such a discount, I don\u2019t think investors are looking for much, but weak guidance could still have severe impacts. I\u2019m probably going with calls, or I might wait until after earnings to buy calls. Let me know what you guys are thinking. \n\nTDLR: I probably won\u2019t play earnings, but will consider calls depending on the management call. \n\nSorry there aren\u2019t any links or sources.
