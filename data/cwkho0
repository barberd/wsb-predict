{"id": "cwkho0", "title": "Morning Briefing (8/28/2019)", "selftext": "# Futures market fades away with interest rates\n\nU.S. futures and global stocks have struggled for direction today, as investors remain cautious about declining sovereign bond yields and uncertainty in U.S.-China trade relations. The S&amp;P 500 futures trade seven points, or 0.2%, below fair value.\u00a0\n\nThe U.S. Treasury market\u00a0remains a focal point after yesterday saw more flattening and/or inversions within the curve. Low yields are usually a positive consideration for risk assets, but there comes a point when investors begin to fear they are a harbinger for weaker economic and corporate earnings growth.\u00a0\n\nCurrently, the 2-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.51%, and the 10-yr yield is down three basis points to 1.46%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.1% to 98.13. WTI crude is up 1.5% to $55.73/bbl following some bullish inventory data. Official government data will be released at 10:30 a.m. ET.\u00a0\n\nElsewhere, UK Prime Minister Johnson has stirred some attention after he said he would request a suspension of Parliament until mid-October. This move would likely make it harder to block a no-deal Brexit by Oct. 31. The British pound has fallen against the dollar, while UK's FTSE (unch) sees relative strength against its peers.\u00a0\n\nSeparately, the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index declined 6.2% following a 0.9% decline in the prior week.\u00a0\n\nIn U.S. Corporate news:\n\n* **Autodesk** (ADSK 132.25, -17.96): -12.0% after the software company issued downside guidance for next quarter and lowered its FY20 guidance. Top and bottom lines came in better than expected.\n* **Tiffany &amp; Co.** (TIF 84.90, +2.23): +2.7% after beating earnings estimates and reaffirming its outlook.\u00a0\n\nReviewing overnight developments:\n\n* Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region ended the midweek session on a mixed note.\u00a0Japan's Nikkei +0.1%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng -0.2%, China's Shanghai Composite -0.3%, India's Sensex -0.5%, South Korea's Kospi +0.9%, Australia's ASX All Ordinaries +0.5%.\n   * In economic data:\n      * Australia's Q2 Construction Work Done -3.8% qtr/qtr (expected -1.0%; last -2.2%)\n   * In news:\n      * The People's Bank of China fixed the yuan at a fresh 11-year low against the dollar, though the fix was not as low as the market feared.\n      * Reuters reported that the U.S. Department of Defense has approached Australian officials about constructing a rare earth processing plant in order to reduce reliance on China.\n      * Nomura expects the Bank of Japan to announce a reduction in JGB purchases on Friday.\n* Major European indices trade on a mostly lower note.\u00a0STOXX Europe 600: -0.7%, Germany's DAX: -1.0%, U.K.'s FTSE 100: UNCH, France's CAC 40: -0.9%, Italy's FTSE MIB: -0.4%, Spain's IBEX 35: -0.4%.\n   * In economic data:\n      * Eurozone July Private Sector Loans +3.4% yr/yr (expected 3.5%; last 3.3%) and M3 Money Supply +5.2% yr/yr (expected 4.7%; last 4.5%)\n      * Germany's July Import Price Index -0.2% m/m (expected -0.1%; last -1.4%); -2.1% yr/yr (expected -1.7%; last -2.0%).
