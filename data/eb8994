{"id": "eb8994", "title": "Section 1256 tax advantage", "selftext": "I\u2019ve been seeing a lot of people posting about tax season, particularly how to minimize taxes on gains.. first and foremost, if you have gains, then congratulations... \n\nA big issue for retail traders is write offs and deductions that the big guys get. You need to understand capital gains and capital losses are treated entirely different than ordinary gains and ordinary losses. Without incorporating as a business you are kinda stuck without write offs and deductions that a business gets..\n\nThe one loophole for small people is section 1256.. section 1256 applies to any/most futures and indexes like SPX.. section 1256 states that gains are to be taxed at 60/40 ratio.. that means if you have 100k gain in securities that fall into section 1256 category, 60% of the 100k is taxed as LONG TERM CAPITAL GAINS and 40% will be taxed as SHORT TERM CAPITAL GAINS... that\u2019s one big advantage.. another is the elimination of capital losses and wash sale rule BECAUSE section 1256 securities are traded as a Mark-to-Market which essentially converts gains into ordinary gains and ordinary losses.. \n\nWith that said, I must warn all the autists on this forum that futures and indexes are not for everyone. You can incur severe losses, especially with future contracts. But with proper execution, risk can be minimized and reward can be great. Happy trading and good luck everyone.", "created_utc": 1576460720, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eb8994/section_1256_tax_advantage/", "is_self": true}
