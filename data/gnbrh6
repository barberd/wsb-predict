Like all of you retards, I immediately jumped into buying puts and lost 30k (not shown in the video cause that was on Schwab, I decided I liked RH\u2019s UI more \ud83d\ude02, Schwab was too serious). I\u2019m pretty comfortable with the amount I\u2019m putting into these bets cause I\u2019m a degenerate poker/blackjack gambler who frequent the casinos and am used to huge losses.\n\nIn May, I got tired of taking it from JP, and. after seeing the TWLO and FSLY rocket ship, I spent a whole night looking for the lotto ticket, found DDOG that clearly had wining customers like Peloton, Shopify, Activision all on its platform. So I went ALL IN, sold half before their earnings and ran with the rest:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yrm0o544dxz41.png?width=216&format=png&auto=webp&s=548635a4e7a7e3a8570cfc6785f6b0d556865e6d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/efpj87d5dxz41.png?width=216&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ff8c70fd3946bc6efff240b586540610f1e268c\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn to my current plays, I have about 120k all in calls on these. Since these are all just profits, I\u2019m feeling pretty chill and will hold them through ERs. I\u2019m like 70% confident on HUYA, 80% on SPLK, 50% on HPQ, 50% on PLAN.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k83njq1hdxz41.png?width=216&format=png&auto=webp&s=84b013ebb977c12eeeabf418e5c0440476058e99\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4uldx1yhdxz41.png?width=216&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd44094026fbdb302faf4bb9319f8f5c338e58c9\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8w57bb4jdxz41.png?width=216&format=png&auto=webp&s=180a47aeaf9998df86e0cb3ad00f8ce4185a69af\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/30hz3sbldxz41.png?width=216&format=png&auto=webp&s=75fcb1c899295b888e771b743973da061d1af9a2\n\nWhy am I sharing all this?? \n\n1. To stroke my ego\n2. I learned everything from this subreddit, and got all my trade ideas from the daily threads here, so I just want to give back and contribute.\n\nLove you guys and lets go make some tendies!!", "created_utc": 1589982934.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gnbrh6/i_am_a_gay_bear_converted_to_bull_240k_since_may/", "is_self": true}
