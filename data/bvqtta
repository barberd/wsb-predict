But I only sold out of some positions on Friday. And have a cash deposit I already bought and sold stock with still pending. My account shows 0% withdrawals and half unsettled. My question is would I be able to buy puts and close them the same day with those funds. Or will have to be stuck holding. I ask because this happened before on SPY calls I was up 200% then went negative when I couldn't sell them.", "created_utc": 1559430356, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bvqtta/alright_degenerates_i_need_your_insight/", "is_self": true}
