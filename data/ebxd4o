{"id": "ebxd4o", "title": "Short $REAL into Dec 25th lockup expiry", "selftext": "Since the RealFake has been getting a bit more attention recently I thought it would be interesting to post my DD on the stock. I've been short this piece of shit since right before last quarter earnings. \n\nJust to give some background for those who don't know, Real is an online marketplace for used luxury goods that recently went public. The company's business model requires a large amount of operational support and an inherently inefficient supply chain, yet mgmt calls itself a \"fashion and tech\" company. \n\nThe CEO Julie Wainright, ran Pets.com during its brief public life, she then went on the lead 2 other bust companies. The company has been a cash consuming machine with multiple VC rounds, the most recent at $5 (so insiders are sitting on 3x gains).\n\n**Competition**\n\nCompetitive landscape is quite crowded and recently heating up. Farfetch and ebay have launched similar products/platforms. Real take rate is very high, with all in costs to the seller close to 40-45%, part of the bull thesis is that REAL can raise take rates, even though rates have been flat for last 5 quarters. There is risk that competitors will force Real to lower their take rate (or at least put a ceiling on it)  as other platforms have sup 30% take rate.\n\n**Valuation**\n\nReal is trading 4x consensus forward sales for a chronic loss making machine. Sell side is anchoring valaution to that of FTCH, ETSY, and RVLV. The economics of Real's business is very different from these other marketplaces. Real has high incremental costs for each sale and is struggling to scale, as opposed to the asset light model of Etsy. I believe SFIX is the most comparable in terms of profile and it trades at 1x sales. Real's equity would be worth close to $8 a share in this scenario. \n\n**lockup catalyst**\n\nOriginal Pre-IPO investors are locked up until 25th of Dec. The free float today is 17.7m shares. after lockup all 85.8m shares will be available for trading. So 68.1m shares will be unleashed into the market, 4x the number of available shares today. Insiders are sitting on huge gains and are most likely to get out asap. \n\nMy Position: https://imgur.com/a/d1mRZOF", "created_utc": 1576597205, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ebxd4o/short_real_into_dec_25th_lockup_expiry/", "is_self": true}
