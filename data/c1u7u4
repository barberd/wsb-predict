{"id": "c1u7u4", "title": "So you want to be rich?", "selftext": "Watching this subreddit for a while now, I see a lot of wannabe smartypants who act like stock prophets but really don't know how the game works.  I also see a lot of insane yolo2bust moves.  Sometimes you get lucky but sometimes not.  Seems like a lot of you really want to be rich. I get it. Money is great but it also has its problems too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think it is time one of the silent drillers like me step in and give you younglings a chance to experience the other side of money, the side where you have a good amount of it.  Instead of trolling you for your faggyD trades, I am going to do you a solid.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am a multimillionaire many times over and one of those 40+ dudes you jellyjerk to while watching Wall Street and Wolf of Wall Street.  Yes, some of us did shit like that and even more that will never end up in movies. Nothing beat the 80s and early 90s for the shit you could pull and get away with to make money and pussy.  Regulations, stocks, and girls are now really weird.  But it didn't used to be and maybe someday it will be great again.  Men were men back then, even the ones who liked dick.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, if you really want to be rich and you have at least $10k then I will help you get your first million and set you on the path to getting there.  No gimmicks, no bullshit, no trick, just real power trades.  But what happens after you get it? That's the lesson I will teach you.  You will remember me for the rest of your life and some of you will regret you followed my plan while others of you will go on to greatness.  Money will only amplify your inner shitty or your inner greatness.  Some of you will OD on drugs and some of you will become titans of industry.  I won't write your fate but I will give you one foot into the big leagues.  The rest is up to you.  For July and August, I am your Fairy TradeFather.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking ahead, starting July 8 to early August, I will update this thread with roughly 30-40 trades throughout our trading adventure.  It will range between zero and a few trades per day. You will need to follow me so you can get into them within 30 minutes of me posting them unless I specify just do it by end of day or under a certain entry point. Most of these trades will be swing trades that you hold for a day or two but we may do a handful of round trips based on how my information is lining up. If you're under the PDT rule, make sure you do no other trades other than the ones I tell you to do during this period. This way you can follow the trades. You'll also need a 2:1 margin account and the ability to do both stocks and options, the ability to short, and can trade pinksheets.  If you deviate and fuck up that is on you.  I also expect that you have actually done a trade before and know how to submit both limit and market trades with stop and trailing stop orders and trades in extended hours before/after market.  I'm also not going to explain a straddle or vertical spread to you. Figure it out with youtube or the library. It's not hard. Grandmas do it. If you're some foot in the grave boomer who is bitching because your Roth or 401k won't let you make some of these trades like OTC shit, go get a real account and come back.  You should already be setup by now so fuck off. This is for the young guys who need a little bump in the right direction like so many of us got back in the day.  Time to pay it forward.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe stop when we exceed 1 mil liquid. If you follow these trades exactly as I lay them out, you will have an account balance in excess of one million usd by the end of july +/- $250k for taxes.  I will be doing the exact same trades along with you to show my faggot nephew and his Ivy league MBA friends that I am still their superior and that their education doesn't mean dick when it comes to trading.  Common sense is the asset that keeps on giving. Rick, if you out me on this forum I will tell your gf about your trip to New Orleans last year and destroy your chance at inheritance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay I'm heading to St. Lucia for a few weeks but when I get back I will do this for all of you. Start watching this thread at 7am eastern time Monday July 8th.  I'm tired of y'all bitching about not having money.  Once you have this cash, don't blame me if you end up worse.  To those who use it the right way, don't forget this lesson. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso I will not be responding to private chats so don't try.   Yes I am putting my rep on the line but since you all seem to like to gamble in the market, what do you have to lose.  See all you fuckers after the 4th.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Follow my trades starting July 8th and I will make you a millionaire (pre taxes).", "created_utc": 1560810934, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c1u7u4/so_you_want_to_be_rich/", "is_self": true}
