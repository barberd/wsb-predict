If you didn't and just harassed me in the comments/DMs - just waiting for the hate you're going to give me on this one :)\n\n**tldr; $AAPL will touch $165 by August 1st.** In the spirit of u/scarvesandsuspenders , I'll be doing the same ban bet. \"If AAPL doesn't touch 165 by August 1st, I will take a one day ban from posting for every person who comments saying \"BAN\u201d. However fair is fair, if AAPL does touch 165 you get banned for an entire month. (Over one million of you and only one of me so i gotta even out the odds.)\"\n\nHere's his post if you need a reference: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fsnp4i/spy\\_below\\_205\\_by\\_417\\_and\\_vix\\_to\\_atleast\\_95\\_by\\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fsnp4i/spy_below_205_by_417_and_vix_to_atleast_95_by_the/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xs0gv5tah5q41.png?width=2138&format=png&auto=webp&s=b833fcaf61841eeaf2673284fa4f96d690d091e2\n\n**DD:**\n\nUS tech should not be touched even on dips. Many investors will be tempted to touch names like MSFT & APPL as they continue to drop, don't fucking listen to the Cramers and permabulls on CNBC. The drop in US Tech has just begun and I think it will see multiple years of vexation before hanging around an eventual bottom for at-least **2 years** after it has formed.\n\nThis is not just going to happen with Apple, most of the big names that went parabolic in 2019 like Microsoft will go through the same thing. Tech stocks have formed massive 5-6+ year shooting stars and the wealth transfer has begun. The glory days are long gone, The only real 'true' longs will be in energy when crude rises with inflation for those that outlast this historic bear market in oil.\n\nInflation -> Hyperinflation -> Stagnation, this will cause an additional recession after this current recession.\n\nIf you measure the reflex angle of the declines in Apple over its history, they range between 75-80 degrees. This time will be no different and the stock will fall as stated by the timeline I stated or even earlier. Ooooo magic lines and angles!!!!\n\nOn the next leg down, the Nasdaq will lead. This means that all your tech or \"growth\" stocks that have been born, raised in the days of debt are about to meet Bear Jesus. Apple wasn't raised in the last 20 years and lord knows they have more cash than JPOW but it's gotten out of hand and is going to come back down to reality & will be dragged down with the rest of the sector.\n\nPrice still below Ichimoku Cloud, 200ish and 180ish will offer temp support but they won't hold and will ultimately fail. I wouldn't be surprised if we see $130's by end of summer.\n\nSince I know how much of you like magical lines on charts, here's another one for you:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Fucking Textbook](https://preview.redd.it/7x730o5ch5q41.png?width=2702&format=png&auto=webp&s=3acb32e226c3da6362f3fe5b6f44510910878312)\n\nAAPL 1st falls to 618% fib level. Didn't reach new highs so it can be reasonably considered this recent move up was the 4th wave. 5th wave incoming and I can see anything from 166 down to 156 but for the sake of the bet, let's just call it 165.\n\n**Current Positions:**\n\n$AAPL $220 4/17p's ---> going to cash these out in the next week and roll them to 9/18 $150's  \n$SPY $220 5/15p's  \n$VIX $70 5/20c's\n\n[VIX analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frg95j/where_is_the_vix_going_only_time_im_helping_you/)\n\nRegardless of the hate this post will probably get, one thing is certain... **Fuck Jartek.**\n\nLook for FANG+ index to fall to 2300 as well. 2020 was the supposed year of a continuing bull market, multiple expansion and more gains. Clearly, that is halted indefinitely. With negative earnings, massive disruption of supply chains and simply the fact that consumers have no savings nor the money to buy lucrative items, the fact is, US tech will eventually be a buy, but not yet.\n\nLet's have some fun :)", "created_utc": 1585717721.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fst76j/us_tech_the_upcoming_massacre_aapl_heading_to/", "is_self": true}
