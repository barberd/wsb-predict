Some of you fucks weren't even born yet, so before you go around talking shit about how it's a Chinese company and this and that... have some respect for this dinosaur. \n\n* Price-to-cash is .21 - Meaning for every dollar in stock price, the company has nearly 5 dollars in cash in the bank. \n* \\#7 Ranked Website -  [https://www.alexa.com/topsites](https://www.alexa.com/topsites) (compare the other top 10 and their market caps... SOHU is just under 350 million in market cap, while the others are multi-billion)\n* Undervalued, even compared to other Chinese Internet Stocks. It has about 2 billion in sales. So does SINA and WB. But SINA is 2 billion market cap and WB is 7.5 billion market cap.\n\nBottom line is this looks like it bottomed out in May and it's a possible 5 bagger.
