But the market is so divorced from the economy that fuck it, here is how I make plays:\n\n# 1) Strategy -- The \"Common Sense\" Observation Approach\n\nI picked up a stock book years ago but it bored me so I never read it; the only Greek I know is how to yell \"Opa!\" and light cheese on fire. So how do I choose my investments? I observe the world around me and bet on trends. Here's my decision-making process on stocks that have made me money:\n\n* I buy shit online, everyone I know buys shit online. I see a lot of Amazon credit cards at work **---> Invest in Amazon**\n* I resell on eBay and notice tons of sales during lockdown. What company also sells shit online that people have forgotten about? **---> Calls on eBay**\n* Corona is cockblocking dating. Girls were afraid to catch AIDs from strangers, now they're afraid to die just from talking to a dude. **--> Calls on MTCH (Desperate Man Money)**\n* Retail is getting assblasted, people aren't shopping IRL. What's a company that relies on foot traffic that will one day die like JC Penny? **----> Puts on** **URBN**\n* Man's greatest achievement is space. It's the final fucking frontier. Who be doing space right now? **---> Invest in TESLA**\n* Car dealerships closed due to corona, people poors. What people gonna do with the vehicles they own and all the free time they've got? Fix 'em. **---> Calls on AAP (Advanced Auto Parts)**\n* Men bored at home looking at they naggy wives and leaky porches. How they gonna spend their time and feel productive? Fix shit. **---> Calls on LOWES**\n* WSB creaming themselves over Draft King. Who has FOMO of the newest hot stock? Every greedy fucker here. **---> Calls on DKINGS**\n* When lockdown first hit, no one could eat at restaurants anymore. Who gonna want to cook? No one. **----> Invest in Blue Apron (Didn't know Options yet)**\n* What's a shitty company with earnings posting soon that only got hyped up due to hysteria?              **----> Puts on Blue Apron**\n* People bored at home, wasting monies on video games. Who benefits the most from microtransactions? **---> Calls on Take-Two Interactive**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 2) Committing to an idea -- Hiking in the woods on acid\n\nEvery other week I drop about 150\u00b5g of acid and go hiking somewhere on the Appalachian Trail with my ukulele. This is where the magic happens. This is where stock decisions get made.\n\nSomewhere out on a mountain, as my ego dissolves, I ponder the world, my place in it, people's behavior, and come to some startling fucking truths. On the comedown I get on Robinhood and shift around my portfolio. The moves are thought out rationally, then the decision is made irrationally. This is how I make the tendies.\n\n# 3) Lessons Learned\n\nSuccess breeds confidence. I've made good decisions but I've never invested very much into any one thing (Fear). Now with options I'm understanding things better, I'm trusting myself more completely. Gonna make bigger bets, take bigger hits.\n\n*Options lesson*: Abort your failures early before you start paying alimony on a bastard child with Down's. Let the winners run. Set a limit for success (20% for me) and pull out when you hit it. Best to accrue gains slowly than to gamble longterm on ridiculous wins for numbers and dates you pull out your ass. Sell contracts early; time is a bitch and fuck that.\n\nI'll post again in a couple months so y'all can see just how fucking stupid these fundamentals are and where they take me. Peace bitches.\n\n    tl;dr I don't know what the fuck I'm doing but it's working out. \n    Buy a ukulele, take acid and trade stocks on acid, \n    eat buttery KFC breaded tendies.", "created_utc": 1590721636.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gskstf/wbs_taught_me_options_last_week_you_too_can_copy/", "is_self": true}
