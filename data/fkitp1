{"id": "fkitp1", "title": "WSB will cause the next depression", "selftext": "We're all fucked and WSB is  responsible. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBanks wanna make money right?  We've been in a low volatility environment where as many of us autists have stated in the past year: \"stonks only go up\". Now - banks running investment firms based on leverage will sell a certain number of shorts outrageously out of the money to maximize profit. Think about it -  if you owned 500 shares of a company and expected the overall market to generally go up you might be willing to sell puts against the stock at say, 60% valuation - but that would require us to have a stock market crash we haven't seen in 30+ years - so outrageously rare and my fat bonus check depends on squeaking out every dollar. Given the relative ease of writing outrageously OTM options with the thinking that it's always going up by X amount for the last year has caused us to be fucked.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSay the stock is $100 and you, wanting that fat bonus decide that the algorithm selling options against the stock is free money. You might say \"well, there's no way that the call will be exercised if I put the value between $160 and $40.\" and sell the options for $0.05. As you're taking fat lines of that gogo powder thinking to yourself: \"Ha - Suckers. I got $0.05 of literally free money\". You're guaranteed to  make money since the stock will stay around $100.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nExcept now it's not - Those 5c are actually in danger of cashing out - you sold that option and put such astrononomically little weight on that ever cashing out - the probability of that option actually requiring the shares it promises are higher. Rather than being  0.01% probability of not expiring, they're now at 1% (or 10%) probability of not expiring. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh shit. I need to fix this situation so I can keep my liquidity going and the fat rails on the hookers ass - I have to get rid of my position with these options. I can do one of two things:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1) Buy a call option at the current price (or rather, at a loss since I am now paying for the IV that said this stock could go higher)\n\n2) Sell my call options to the market. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, I want to do #2 - but shit I can't find someone with enough volume to do so; other banks are in the same boat as me. They just want to offload the position without caring about the IV crush you're paying a premium on top of the option. Normally, we'd be forced to do #1 - except that has changed with the rise of the retail investor and WSB - we are the dumb fucks with enough volume to buy these dumb ass options. We don't know what we're doing and we're playing with \"fuck around\" levels of money compared to banks. I'm going to go with the more profitable option and choose to sell my call option to the market. Now I, the bank, sold my call option and I don't need to worry about it - but someone does actually have to execute these stupid ass options that shouldn't have existed. No-one ever expected to actually have to exercise these dumb ass options. Now SOMEONE has to excercise this - and it's a shit ton of money I have to move and a shit ton of low probability that it would have happened - I'm not prepared.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSay I'm the writer of a short - I now have to pay some fucktard $100 for his stupid ass stock. It never should have happened but fine jackass - here is your money. I gotta pay for this somehow - well, I have a bunch of other stock that I'm buying from other people - let's rebalance our portfolio by selling our stocks. It's not like I have a choice here - I'm forced to sell this at whatever rate I can get in order to not go insolvent. I can't hold on to them as I might normally when it's volatile since I won't have enough cash at any given point (I own a fuckton of stocks you see - they're the majority of my net worth)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow I'm selling stocks and I'm going to keep selling stocks when I'm having to buy all these stupid ass options we autists keep buying. This increases stock volume and forces swings in the market that normally wouldn't have happened. So say i'm the third largest investment bank in the world. I got a lot of stocks right? Say I'm the contract writer for two stocks: A and B. Someone is trying to cash in stock B's options. I don't have that many of stock B, but I have a lot of stock A. I gotta get rid of Stock A and i have to go buy jackass B's stock B.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut remember - this volatility and the contract being excercised was a SUPER rare thing that was going to have to happen - I definitely wrote too many contracts against the stock - but now I don't have the stock on hand and I have to have a shit ton of cash on hand to actually execute this. I'm in credit crunch mode.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow the scary part: we're massively leveraged right now even after the financial crisis, and what happens when you keep having people sell stocks and demand is weak from retail investors or everyone else? Stocks crater. The fed is trying to stop this freeze up from forcing everyone to sell assets to cover this shitshow , but everyone is still freaking out and we haven't even gotten to the scary part of financial downturn. Usually I'd say buy the dip - but we are fucked as an economic system.  Goodbye banks. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/the-big-banks-may-get-to-keep-their-risky-investments-after-all/2017/06/09/df9d134e-49f8-11e7-a186-60c031eab644\\_story.html](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/the-big-banks-may-get-to-keep-their-risky-investments-after-all/2017/06/09/df9d134e-49f8-11e7-a186-60c031eab644_story.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe didn't learn shit and all the banks are about to go bankrupt. I'm shorting banks HARD. Jay Powell knows what's up - he's no dummy. Why do you think we just shot our collective load of financial tools in a single weekend? The COVID-19 virus isn't the thing that is going to end the economy - its the banks again. we're fucked and going to have bailout 2020 - just like we had bailout 2008. These banks are far too massive fail now - and we have jackass trump in the white house who has openly declared he will bail out everyone - except you need an act of congress to do so.  The banks are bigger than they were (shitty graph - but makes the point):\n\n[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DDOI06USA156NWDB](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DDOI06USA156NWDB)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWSB will be who started the recession - Banks are overleveraged because you guys are fucking retarded with your calls. \n\nLong term shorts on banks are money printers.
