{"id": "f7sdkj", "title": "The ALLY deal isn\u2019t bad at all", "selftext": "Ally\u2019s purchase of Cardworks of $2.65 billion has been questioned by everybody and has caused a slight dip for it, but let\u2019s look at the long term for it shall we?\n\nAlly has stated that this acquisition is gonna generate them an increase in IRR of more than 20%. Literally the most important aspect of this all. ALLY will now offer and expand one of the most key components of any banking industry today and that\u2019s credit cards. With a large customer base already (which continues to grow) they are now adding credit cards to their arsenal and so the company will expect some sweet revenue from those of course that are ready to pile dat credit card debt. \n\nWith this acquisition, ALLY will target Cardworks existing customer base with their mortgage, investment, etc. marketing tools and target already existing ALLY customers with credit cards. Besides, they\u2019re expected to also buy back $1 billion in their stocks to stir away from the big Cardworks purchase.\n\nALLY in reality is a long term sky rocketing company if you\u2019re willing to stick it out. With current prices at $28.50, expect at least a $30 break in the coming week or perhaps the week after.", "created_utc": 1582377224, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7sdkj/the_ally_deal_isnt_bad_at_all/", "is_self": true}
