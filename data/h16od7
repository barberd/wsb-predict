Do not hold options overnight. I have won some and lost a ton holding overnight and over the weekend. Sometimes I would win big but most times I would lose. In the last couple days I have made back most of my loses just from buying in the morning and selling by EOD.\n2. Always buy with the trend. Several times I have bought calls when the markets was falling or puts when it was rising, thinking that I knew something no one else did and that it was going to reverse. \n3. Technicals and charts do help when working with what is happening during the day. I usually just pay attention to 200 MA. An example is today. The market was selling off, all indices were below the 200 MA. I bought 10 puts of DIA and finally made back most of what I lost holding QQQ overnight after thinking it could only go up from here.\n4. Take a break once in a while. I tried trading everyday and found myself on my phone almost all day, watching futures and worrying about pre/post market movement. If you find yourself watching and trading everyday, then you are probably experiencing FOMO and should back off for a bit.\n\nLastly, I want to thank everyone at WSB for proving endless entertainment with your posts, it really helps me on those days where I'm bummed about my losses and even when I'm happy with my gains. I hope that even one person finds this post helpful. I myself have learned that YOLO doesn't make sense if you do it everyday!", "created_utc": 1591905306.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h16od7/what_i_have_learned_hope_it_can_help_others/", "is_self": true}
