{"id": "gpavxv", "title": "(DD) LULU - Lululemon and why you should not buy puts", "selftext": "I have seen way too many comments and posts asking why Lululemon, a company which focuses on fitness apparel for women is skyrocketing and is reaching ATHs. I'm here to explain to you that LULU is actually one of the strongest apparel companies/retailers on the market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Company summary:**\n\nLululemon is a company that focuses primarily on selling fitness attire for women. They also make some stuff for children and men, but their primary demographic are women who are willing to spend $50+ per item. If you aren't a virgin, then you've probably heard of them or Gymshark, their main (private owned) competitor. If you aren't aware that it's popular, just know there's a subreddit for their products where a bunch of women show off their new overpriced leggings, sports bras, and over sized \"boyfriend t shirts\" (yes that is the name of a product)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Financials:**\n\nI know most autists here don't believe in financials or fundamentals, but let me tell you why LULU is blowing your mind why it keeps going up --- and most likely will keep going up leading to earnings. The big boys do still target a price point for these stocks so it's important to at least acknowledge them while riding the wave up or down. Their last earnings call was Q4 2019 which ended Jan 2020 where they had record sales.\n\n**Income:**\n\n\\-Revenue increased from 916.1M in Q3 2019 to 1.4B in Q4 2019.\n\n\\-Revenue from online sales increased by 38% from 2018-2019.\n\n\\-Revenue from online sales accounted for 28.6% of sales in FY 2019\n\n\\-Q4 2019 - $462.2m EBITDA - 33.07% margin on sales.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSummary: LULU already had a reliable online sales portal. Based on the earnings reports of other retailers and apparel companies, there was a correlation between online sales viability and having a minimal impact from the stay at home lifestyle. They don't need megastores or giant mall space to earn their money and in fact have the highest sales per squarefoot of any company. Thanks to the extremely high markup on their goods they also have impressive margins.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Balance Sheet:**\n\n**-Cash & cash equivalents ending Q4 (End of Feb) was 1,093.5 million aka over $1B in cash/liquid treasury bonds**\n\n**-NO LONG TERM DEBT**\n\n\\-Lease expenses are estimated to be $152M for all of 2020.\n\n\\-They have a revolving credit account for $392M, but given current cash stores it is unlikely to be needed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Other notes:**\n\n\\-LULU's main factories are based in China and SE Asia. Let's be honest, China is going to shove their people back into the factories faster than Trump will and they will be working over time ---- On a realistic note, it's unlikely that logistics will be an issue. Company already had 540M worth of finished goods in inventory going into Q1 2020 so unless we face a second lockdown it is unlikely their supply lines will face long term disruptions.\n\n\\-Their target demographic is likely not very price sensitive. If your girl wasn't dropping over a hundred for a Tuesday morning workout outfit, before COVID, she wasn't a target.  Since they market to women they can charge a premium. Would a man pay $80 for some gym shorts? No, but you can be sure a chick wearing leggings sure will.\n\n\\-Most clothing companies have a problem of seasonality. Fitness / leisurewear normally is an all year round item as people wear it both at home or when working out. There is a possibility it might see an overall increase if the work at home becomes a more permanent fixture in life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EPS projections:**\n\nCurrently the consensus on EPS is sitting at .25-.29 EPS.\n\nThis is terribly off as it assumes that Q1 spanning from February to April would only have a NI $32M\\~ w/ 130.3M shares outstanding. Even if they only managed to sale half of their worst quarter in 2019 (96.6M in Q2 2019) they would still exceed that. Given that physical stores stayed open through February and half of March and that online sales shot up for everyone throughout March/April I think it's fair to assume they will far exceed expectations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs of now, the stock sits at $277. Since I am usually a bear I think it would be wrong to over estimate things, however I won't fight the trend and reality that they're in a better spot than 90% of other retailers. I think it will fluctuate between 285-290 but if people here think it's going to moon to $300++ I think that might be too optimistic. However, I have come to believe in the power of the Fed so I wouldn't be surprised. I would be very cautious about holding past earnings or thinking it will explode much more but I think there's still room for it to cap out at.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPosition (Bought 2 weeks ago): 6/12c 265", "created_utc": 1590261820.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gpavxv/dd_lulu_lululemon_and_why_you_should_not_buy_puts/", "is_self": true}
