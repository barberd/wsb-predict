IV is at 120%, the premium is $13.00 a contract ($1300), and no one knows green or red the next day. Not only do you have to hope you get the direction right, but you also have to hope that your contract doesn't get obliterated.\n\nWhat on earth is the reward to that play? The IV goes up to %200? 90% of the times you get completely crushed and your contract is OH LOOK AT THAT, $6.00 now. Small companies, ok, I get it. But most of these Ers suck. Please someone help me. Walk me through what the hell I am missing here. \n\nIf anyone out there successfully wins on earnings, knock on my door and I will give you my entire net worth. It's only $2000 but still.", "created_utc": 1587503558.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5ntrp/when_will_you_people_learn_that_er_plays_are/", "is_self": true}
