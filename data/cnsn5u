At the moment, money is staying in US Equities, seemingly, because there is nowhere else for it to go. Companies are still buying back their own shares, although investments/innovation are at historic lows. Bond and CD yields are crap. Maybe Gold is an alternative. \n\nWe got a good luck at what a bad day looks like when Trump dropped the10% tariff and China stopped buying US agriculture. But it is certainly true that the 11-year bull market is hard to let go of.\n\nI have been burned several times lately buying puts on QQQ/SPY, only to have the Market bounce back. How can we safely get into short mode? What should we buy? When will the bear market start in earnest?
