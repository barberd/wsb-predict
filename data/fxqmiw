The more people out of work  will result in higher S&P and DJIA numbers. Here's why -\n\nMore people not working, means more people collecting unemployment and taking some of the infinite money that the FED prints. These workers are just waiting and waiting to get back into the economy. When the economy re-opens (sooner than all the bears think), they will work TWICE or THREE TIMES as hard for their paycheck. And they will spend TWO OR THREE TIMES as much money after work at bars and restaurants and hair salons. Why will they do this? Because they've been sitting at home drinking Budweiser for months on end.\n\nThe market knows this and so higher numbers = more people ready to spend when things re-open.\n\nNow, let's do some TA on SPY results after new jobless claims come out today -\n\n5 million new jobless = SPY +5%\n\n10 million new jobless = SPY +20%\n\n20 million new jobless = SPY +50%! <--- personally this is what I'm betting on\n\n&#x200B;\n\n200 SPY 380c 5/15", "created_utc": 1586430888.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxqmiw/the_higher_the_unemployment_the_higher_the_market/", "is_self": true}
