I mean, the company has had a great record on good cash flow, and their idea is great. BYND will be huge in a few years. Who gives a fk if it goes up or down in these months. I'm in it for the long haul (bought normal shares alongside my smaller bull buy).", "created_utc": 1564090803, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/chtyhq/why_i_went_in_on_bynd_yesterday/", "is_self": true}
