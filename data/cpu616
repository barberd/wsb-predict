I have another friend who is an MP assistant and he\u2019s saying Labour + Co are putting it at 60/40 no deal will happen. Basically due to the fact Boris is so unpredictable. \n\nNow it\u2019s all city gossip but ones things for sure...September may be one of the madness months we\u2019ve seen in British politics in a long time.\n\nA vote of no confidence is planned early September and we are actually facing the possibility of a PM refusing to resign if the vote passes.\n\nNow, my autism may hit new highs but share your thoughts. \n\nIf the UK leaves no deal, the \u00a3 will crash. I think most traders aim for \u00a31-$1.10 with some thinking we could pair 1 for 1 within 6 months.\n\nIronically the \u00a3 and \u20ac will be pegged, so in a sick fucked up way the Uk finally will use the euro. \n\nNow I\u2019m thinking my trades for the next 6 months are buying FTSE call options. The \u00a3 fell massively post Brexit and essentially every time the FTSE has neared 7,900-8000(ATH)  it\u2019s been due to weakened sterling inflating UK earnings.\n\n70% of earnings collected from FTSE firms are non-sterling, hence the devalued currency effect. \n\n*china leaves chat* \n\nThe world is burning and I\u2019m loving it.", "created_utc": 1565707771, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cpu616/long_ftse_options_no_deal_brexit/", "is_self": true}
