(this is posted on 8/14 so expire on 8/30)\n\nAfter hours price is currently $29.90\n\n* 1 call for say 33$ (After hours price @ $0.56)\n* 1 put for say 28$ (After hours price @ $0.64)\n\n\nThe likelihood of both being in the money in that time window are relatively high are you would only have to up front \"invest\" $120. \n\nJust a though from a newly wanna be autist duo.
