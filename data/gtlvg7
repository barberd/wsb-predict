{"id": "gtlvg7", "title": "How to lock in gains and avoid the PDT rule", "selftext": "Scenario:\n\nYou purchased 6/3 300 Calls on Fridays dip anticipating a rebound by end of day, and you were correct! You're up +150%.\n\nHowever, you're a sub 25k peasant and have already used your 3 day trades losing money on daily chat pump and dumps and buying at the top out of FOMO. You don't want to risk holding your calls over the weekend seeing that you've already made +150%.\n\nSolution:\n\nSell 6/3 301 Calls to lock in your tendies. Selling calls one strike above creates a spread. At open the next day, buy the calls you sold and sell the calls you bought to lock in the tendies from the previous day.\n\nThe Risk:\n\nBecause you've created a spread, the calls that you sold were not sold \"naked,\" seeing that you own calls one strike below as collateral, so you don't have to worry about unlimited downside.\n\nHowever, if the calls you sell to lock in your tendies are in the money, the person who bought them from you are able to exercise them, which could result in a margin call. You can avoid this situation by day trading with OTM strikes that aren't likely to end up ITM the next day. Even if you end up in this situation, the calls you still own are ITM as well and you can exercise them to cover your ass.\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nI've been trading options for less than 1 year and am slightly retarded.\n\nGood luck fellow retards!", "created_utc": 1590872840.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gtlvg7/how_to_lock_in_gains_and_avoid_the_pdt_rule/", "is_self": true}
