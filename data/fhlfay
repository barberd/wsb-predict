There is something called implied volatility and it will destroy you. You missed out on today, live with it. There will be opportunities to jump in when the market is not moving in 5-7% intervals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: For those arguing IV will not go down at some point. You should volunteer for the beer flu vaccine trials because you obviously can't get more autistic. Fine -- at least buy your PUTS on an up day. Look at 2008 - plenty of rallies during the fall. Those are the days when you buy into short positions. ", "created_utc": 1584039257.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhlfay/psa_dont_fomo_yolo_into_options_today/", "is_self": true}
