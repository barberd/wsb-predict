I don't think it will have effect but that doesn't affect 2/21 gang.  The Barclay Conference Thursday will.  Anyone have any idea what could go on there?  Think we will see significant swing one way or the other.  Announcement? Test/fly/launch Dates?? \n\nI think we'd be dumb to do anything with our positions today or tomorrow.  It all blows up Thursday. For better or for worse.", "created_utc": 1582044804, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f5uqna/alright_spce_221_gang_whats_the_move_any_good_dd/", "is_self": true}
