Looking at the charts looks like its possibly forming a Bullish Bat. Anyone who cares to look at my charts here\u2019s a link but I know you guys might just see a bunch of lines. \n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/chart/HAE/TVJkk1i8-Haemonetics-Corporation-HAE-reversal-zone-Bullish-Bat/\n\nHere is also a bunch of news stuff I\u2019ve found which might peak the interest with links as well. \n\nThe renowned provider of blood management solutions has a market capitalization of $4.99 billion. The company projects 12% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain strong segmental performance. The company surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed estimates in the other one, the average positive surprise being 16.9%.\n\nHaemonetics\u2019 fourth quarter fiscal 2020 results reflected benefits from complexity reduction initiatives, operational excellence program product mix and pricing structure. Further, sustained underlying demand for plasma-based medicines and continued momentum in new business generation and geographical expansion contributed to results despite the challenges posed by the outbreak. Hospital segment saw new product launches and strong sales execution.\n\nHaemonetics\u2019 Plasma segment has been witnessing strong growth for quite some time. In the fiscal fourth quarter, the segment grew 11.7% on an organic basis on 12.5% growth in North America, including 11.8% growth in disposables. The upside primarily resulted from favorable volume and price. Notably, impact of the coronavirus pandemic was limited to disposable sales in the final two weeks of the quarter in North America and Europe.\n\nJapan continued to experience strong sales of plasma products as the company increased and maintained share due to technological issues with a competitor device.\n\nThey have also entered into a definitive agreement to sell certain blood donor management software solution assets within its Blood Center business unit to the Global Products International Group. Global Products International Group is a\u00a0leading\u00a0company\u00a0in providing IT Solutions supporting Healthcare and Social Services.\n\nAnd recently inked a definitive agreement to sell its manufacturing operations in Fajardo, Puerto Rico, to GVS, S.p.A (a provider of advanced filtration solutions for critical applications). Per the agreement, all intellectual property rights to Haemonetics\u2019 proprietary blood filters, currently manufactured at the Fajardo facility, will be retained by the company. In turn, GVS will be given access to certain operating assets, including manufacturing equipment and inventory and a sublease to the facility.\n\nApart from this, the companies have agreed to enter a long-term supply and development agreement. Per the terms of the deal, Haemonetics will provide exclusive rights to GVS to utilize the Fajardo facility to manufacture and supply the blood filters currently produced for Haemonetics.\n\nWith the recent developments, Haemonetics aims to strengthen its blood filtration market on a global scale. Notably, the blood filtration business is a subsegment of the company\u2019s broader Blood Center business.\n\nPer Haemonetics\u2019 management, the collaboration with GVS will enable Haemonetics to upgrade its efficiency and help it deliver reliable and cost-effective products. The alliance is also expected to boost the R&D wing of the companies, paving the way for the introduction of products, ideas and solutions for the blood filtration market.\n\nFor investors\u2019 note, the agreement is expected to close in the second quarter of calendar 2020, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\n\nAlso they were in 34 hedge funds\u2019 portfolios at the end of March for who cares. \n\nAny suggestions are always appreciated. \n\nThinking $90c 9/18 \n\n[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-why-you-should-hold-on-to-haemonetics-stock-for-now-2020-06-08](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-why-you-should-hold-on-to-haemonetics-stock-for-now-2020-06-08)\n\n[https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/haemonetics-announces-sale-of-us-blood-donor-management-software-solution-assets-to-the-gpi-group-301067345.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/haemonetics-announces-sale-of-us-blood-donor-management-software-solution-assets-to-the-gpi-group-301067345.html)\n\n[https://uk.news.yahoo.com/haemonetics-hae-inks-deal-gvs-134701718.html](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/haemonetics-hae-inks-deal-gvs-134701718.html)", "created_utc": 1592711964.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hd0bdp/haemonetics_corp_dd/", "is_self": true}
