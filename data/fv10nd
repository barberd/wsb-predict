{"id": "fv10nd", "title": "The return of the Mormons \u2013 why Utah is probably the next epicenter", "selftext": "Being an aviation nerd, I noticed something strange on my flight tracker app. Fiji Airways is operating a nonstop flight from Nadi to Salt Lake City, a route they don't normally operate. Strange. Further investigation showed another odd flight, this time a LATAM 767 coming in from South America into SLC. My initial thought was that these planes were being shipped to America for long term storage because there was NO possible way that sudden demand between Nadi and Salt Lake City warranted a nonstop flight.\n\nBut then I found this article: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/03/31/mormon-church-is-chartering-jets-bring-thousands-missionaries-home/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/03/31/mormon-church-is-chartering-jets-bring-thousands-missionaries-home/) (press the X in your browser as soon as loading is complete to avoid ad block popup)\n\nThe Mormon church waited until the very last minute to bring home missionaries from the Philippines. Even travel restrictions by the US government didn't phase them. It took the president of the Philippines fucking threatening to kill people who violated quarantined for the Mormon church to take this seriously. Now that most international flight schedules have been canceled, their only option is to charter jets, hence the Fiji Airways and LATAM flights.\n\nFrom their own website, it appears that these are VERY recent developments. By recent, I mean APRIL-recent. And as for the Fiji Airways flight, it is still in the air as I am writing this. [The Mormon website](https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/coronavirus-update#missionary-work) states that only two missionaries have tested positive for the virus so far, and all are being ordered to self-isolate in their homes before returning to missionary activities in the USA. If you're reading this and thinking \"what the actual fuck, I've been quarantined for almost 3 weeks and they're just brining back missionaries now?\", you're not alone.\n\nSo what businesses will be affected by this? **EVERY BUSINESS THAT USES CALL CENTERS BASED IN AMERICA.** American call centers frequently favor Utah because of its large population of well-educated young adults: [https://www.standard.net/news/business/low-cost-young-workforce-makes-utah-a-magnet-for-call/article\\_186c92d0-e2c2-552e-add6-59127ddd8468.html](https://www.standard.net/news/business/low-cost-young-workforce-makes-utah-a-magnet-for-call/article_186c92d0-e2c2-552e-add6-59127ddd8468.html). Additionally, Skywest is based in Utah. If you're wondering where the connection between Mormons and Utah is, then you simply haven't been to Utah. In fact, it is safe to assume that Utah is the **only** state still experiencing an influx of international travel.\n\nMormons are good people, just like the rest of us. It is a shame those in charge of their organization failed to recognize this potential risk and is now endangering an entire state. I do not currently hold any positions related to this, as I have just made the discovery today. With that said, I am a full on bear.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR \u2013** The Mormons forgot to bring their kids home from the third world and they're chartering big jets to do it now.
