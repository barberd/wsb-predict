Leaked slides from a hospital presentation show how dire the situation will be, best case. (More on this point below)  \n\n   1.

From the above point, you can see that there will be approximately 4.8M hospitalizations and 1.8M ICU admissions. The U.S. has nowhere **near** the capacity to be able to handle that. Hospitals have been overwhelmed in the past with the seasonal flu, to the extent that patients would be in tents outside in the parking lot. Covid-19, which is drastically more dangerous and much more contagious, will cause many more problems than that. I believe systemic healthcare failure will cause many more issues than the deaths of covid-19 itself. Here's an interesting thread:  \n\n   1.

Specifically, the U.S. and China trading has increased immensely. This virus will have much more of an impact than what it's currently at. We're hitting correction levels now, we still have to hit falling levels. Supply and demand shock on both ends is going to create mayhem.  \n\n   1. [https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c5700.html](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c5700.html)\n4. The P/E ratio of the S&amp;P 500 is extremely close to 2008 levels.  \n\n   1. [https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-pe-ratio/table/by-year](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-pe-ratio/table/by-year)\n5. The Fed have wasted all the useful ammo. Sure, they can keep trying to inject billions into the banks, but it'll simply delay, or possibly even accelerate, the impending doom. The demand shock coupled with the growing household debt, is going to cause major economic problems. Many consumers live paycheck-to-paycheck, and if they are forced to go home due to their workplace closing, many of them could become homeless.  \n\n   1.

Wuhan just upped it's quarantine period to fucking 28 days, double the previous 14-day period, due to people still testing positive. Can you imagine how fast hospitals and ICU units will fill, and then be unable to bring in more people for a fucking **month?** People will be in hospital hallways, parking lots, everywhere.  \n\n   1.

People say this is nothing similar to the 2008 recession because subprime mortgages were different and had their roots in everything. Sure, but the current corporate debt bubble is our new housing bubble. Bullshit appointment-traded bonds are being lumped together into ETF's with the idea that magical liquidity will appear. There's about $10 trillion USD worth of this bullshit.  \n\n   1. The U.S. has leveraged loans totaling $1.2 trillion: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/mayrarodriguezvalladares/2019/09/22/leveraged-loans-and-collateralized-loan-obligations-are-riskier-than-many-want-to-admit/#5e69cf7f6602](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mayrarodriguezvalladares/2019/09/22/leveraged-loans-and-collateralized-loan-obligations-are-riskier-than-many-want-to-admit/#5e69cf7f6602)\n   2.

This is the shit currently going on in Wuhan. This is how bad it can fucking get even with a government that can literally do shit like this. Do you think the U.S. government has even the remote ability to enact upon things like this? Do you think U.S. citizens would even allow this shit to happen out of stubbornness and ignorance? No.  \n\n   1. [https://twitter.com/jenniferatntd/status/1236175007421587457](https://twitter.com/jenniferatntd/status/1236175007421587457)\n10. The U.S. is putting an absolute abysmal amount of effort towards this, and running it like a third-world country.\n   1.
