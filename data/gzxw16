Kudos to all of you that took the DD to heart. \n\nNow what \u2014 Tomorrow, June 10th, Congress debates the contents of the \u201cJustice in Policing Act\u201d bill that has the nationwide body camera requirements (150,000 nationally uniformed officers + additional 650,000 statewide potential requirements). \n\nWhat can we expect \u2014 good news for us, the body camera stipulation is not a partisan issue. The conflict in tomorrow\u2019s bill is about judicial oversight and doesn\u2019t relate to this play. I\u2019m sure this\u2019ll be tomorrow\u2019s headline. \n\nWhen will the Bill pass \u2014 pending tomorrow\u2019s action, which we can all read about in the headlines, we can expect it before the end of June. Several congress members have discussed fast tracking it earlier than that. \n\nHow high will DGLY and AAXN go \u2014 Hard to say, but I am betting on AAXN being valued at over 110 and DGLY at 10 by the end of this week. \n\nShould I sell \u2014 if you want profits tomorrow, eod would probably work. If you want to go big, as I am, I am holding until the Bill passes through June. \n\nTo those asking why my post was taken down at r/stocks (1.6k upvotes + 200 upvotes) \u2014 it was because I told them they were wrong about this being a pump and dump, and they didn\u2019t like that. \n\nThanks y\u2019all.", "created_utc": 1591741726.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gzxw16/shoutout_to_the_dgly_aaxn_crowd_whats_next/", "is_self": true}
