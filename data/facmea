{"id": "facmea", "title": "Gay Conversion Therapy", "selftext": "So for much of 2019 I was a gay and lost a decent chunk of money.  Bought a bunch of Boeing calls in the summer, after everything expired worthless, switched to being a gay bear for quite a while, buying GLD calls, SPY puts.  I made a post about how I was about to be fucked in the ass, then proceeded to get fucked in the ass while thousands of you laughed at me - it got really bad, I was like that famous Australian party dude who used to hide behind men's urinals in the 80s and 90s so he could get peed on.  It was like this for all of Q4 and in January I kind of just stepped away for a while after being wrong for so long.\n\nFinally after onslaughts of berating on this sub by Bulls, I straightened up, cut my hair, discarded my bead necklaces, glitter cream, started to take on an aspect and effect that's more in line with Mike Pence - stoic, clean cut, while underneath just seething with repressed homosexual rage.  I, \"manned up,\" and became a straight bull yesterday morning, placing orders in the $10k range in a bull direction after the market drop the day prior.\n\nAnd then what do I see on this sub later in the night?  Do I see a video from haupt91 cheering us all on, leading us to glory?  No, all of the main bulls have basically forsaken the thread and the entire planet is gay, like in some sci fi novel about a space war veteran returning to earth after centuries of battle.  Basically, everyone is in here is now gay, and I am now straight and bullish.  What the fuck you guys?\n\nOn top of that, here's a video from Trump, who has fucked me many times before, now fucking me again...he's wheezing, sweating, contradicting himself...\"We have fifteen patients and they are all getting better,\" about five minutes later leads into, \"Ahem, well one of the patients is kind of back and fourth between the hospital and home\" and then another minute later turns into \"One of them is...well, he's really, really sick,\" (with a sort of grimace face indicating that this person is going to die).  He's switching between reading a script and free associating and just listing off names of countries for minutes on end because he fucking knows something and he wants to keep himself from letting it out.  Then to cap it all off he ends his fucking speech by saying, \"Mike Pence is President now, I don't really do non-exponential improvement stuff, goodbye.\"  It was honestly the worst bullshitting that Trump has ever done in his entire Presidency if not his life...to the point where I think even Mike Pence might finally come out as gay just to be straight with the nation and I'm thinking of doing the same.\n\nTD;LR - haupt91 has forsaken us, Trump has forsaken us, we are fucking fucked.", "created_utc": 1582812668, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/facmea/gay_conversion_therapy/", "is_self": true}
