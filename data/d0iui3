{"id": "d0iui3", "title": "Congressional activity: week of 9/9 to 9/13", "selftext": "Good Friday, and welcome to this installment of Congressional activity and financial markets. The general idea is that the statements and actions of federal legislators can have an effect on broader markets. I try to provide interesting happenings as well as participants. I don't suggest any specific positions: I'd like those to come from consensus in the discussion.\n\nA few things to keep in mind:\n\n- All of this is subject to change at any time (i.e. votes can be delayed, hearings can be canceled, witnesses can be struck). The House and Senate operate under their own rules, and those rules are entirely enforced by the chambers themselves.\n- The House is controlled by Democrats, and the Senate is controlled by Republicans. So if a hearing is happening in the House, it is somewhat safe to assume that it reflect a relatively liberal position. However, the committees have representation by both parties, so the discussion won't be entirely one-sided.\n- In general, recorded votes on the ``floor'' of either chamber are taken the most seriously, followed by votes (or hearings) taken by the full committee, followed by votes (or hearings) by a subcommittee.\n- The Senate is generally taken more seriously than the House, since it moves slower and is less likely to produce legislation. Thus, the legislation it does produce is exceptionally important. A corollary, though, is that the Senate has much less activity in any given week (only 100 members, but the same workload [plus appointments] as the 435-member House).\n- The floor schedule of either chamber is notoriously hard to predict more than a day or two in advance, as it is structured almost entirely by party leadership and can change on the whims of that leadership. Hearings, however, are relatively more stable and scheduled. (In other words, the hearings are much more certain to happen, while the votes can be added or subtracted with much less certainty.)\n- This is not all activity, just activity most likely to be relevant to financial markets. There is also no guarantee this activity has an effect on any individual stock or market. I'm not an expert, and this is not advice. It is the beginning of a discussion.\n\n***\n\nResults from last week:\n\n- Congress has been on recess for over a month.\n\n***\n\nShared activity (across both chambers):\n\nNone, really. Congress is easing back into the schedule of holding hearings and working on legislation. It's also important to note that we're approaching the back half of the back nine of the Congressional session. This term started calendar 2019, and it will end September 2020, to allow members a wide schedule to go home and campaign in their districts for 2020. So as Congress picks up work, expect [a] the topics of hearings to more closely reflect legislative priorities, [b] the pace of hearings to slow as [c] the pace of legislation (including debate on the floor) picks up.\n\n***\n\nHouse activity:\n\nThe House is likely to consider three pieces of legislation, all related. [HR 205](https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20190909/BILLS-116HR205-RCP116-29.pdf), [HR 1146](https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20190909/BILLS-116HR1146-RCP116-30.pdf), and [HR 1941](https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20190909/BILLS-116HR1941-RCP116-31.pdf) protect the coastlines and environments of Florida, the Arctic, and generally, respectively. Specifically, each piece of legislation imposes annual fees for ``facilities above the waterline'' as well as for drilling rigs (treated separately). The fees are more expensive than the ones I could currently find: for instance [$30,500 for drilling rigs in the Gulf of Mexico](https://www.bsee.gov/sites/bsee.gov/files/notices-to-lessees-ntl//ntl-2018-no3-inspection-fees-for-fiscal-year-fy-2018.pdf) versus $33,500 under the proposed legislation. Maybe more importantly, the legislation makes permanent a [prohibition on drilling activity in certain areas](https://cleanenergy.org/blog/united-coast/).\n\nThe House will hold subcommittee hearings on 9/10 on [growing the clean energy economy](https://smallbusiness.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=2801). Interestingly, the witness list doesn't include any ``green'' energy (solar, wind) companies, but instead has interest group representatives from Western Dubuque Biodiesel and the Marcellus Shale Coalition. There's also a labor union representative, specific to environmental labor. This is somewhat paralleled with select committee hearings on 9/10 on [manufacturing jobs in the climate crisis](https://climatecrisis.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/manufacturing-jobs). Information on this hearing is sparse, but it would be interesting if the message was to produce clean energy solutions (like solar panels) domestically, given the president's Made in the USA rhetoric.\n\nThe House will hold full committee hearings on 9/10 on [protecting student borrowers](https://financialservices.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=404230). There is a ton of legislation associated with this topic: from limiting lenders to those who cooperate more with the CFPB, to legislation aimed at [leveraging student loan debt into home equity](https://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/bills-1163511ih.pdf), which would be a huge leap. The legislation isn't specific yet, but nothing is likely to emerge that is good for loan companies.\n\nThe House will hold subcommittee hearings on 9/10 on [PFAS contaminants for the third time this session](https://oversight.house.gov/legislation/hearings/the-devil-they-knew-pfas-contamination-and-the-need-for-corporate-0). We've [covered this before](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bpr6xw/congressional_activity_week_of_520_to_524/), but this is the third time. It's getting safer to assume that both chambers are gearing towards either some regulation or penalty. Some companies might be [more at risk than others](https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2019/05/09/3-m-lawsuit-pfas-water-contamination-michigan/3291156002/).\n\nThe House will hold full committee hearings on 9/11 on [barriers to small medical practice](https://smallbusiness.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=2794). These are aimed directly at insurers. This time, instead of complaining about rising costs or drug costs or inflexibility, we're investigating the effects of bureaucratic red tape, like step therapy ([forcing patients to try multiple cheaper medicines before ``stepping up'' to a more expensive one](http://prescriptionprocess.com/barriers-to-access/step-therapy/)) and prior authorization. On its own, it's not like to move healthcare stocks (like some of the prescription drug hearings have), but it's another stone in the landscape.\n\nThe House will hold full committee hearings on 9/12 on online platforms and market power: the [importance of data and privacy](https://docs.house.gov/Committee/Calendar/ByEvent.aspx?EventID=109910). No witnesses have been announced yet, and my prior is that this will actually be moved to the subsequent week to pair with [the Senate's own hearing](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/competition-in-digital-technology-markets-examining-acquisitions-of-nascent-or-potential-competitors-by-digital-platforms, more on that below).\n\n\n***\n\nSenate activity: \n\nThe Senate will hold full committee hearings on 9/10 on [housing finance reform](https://www.banking.senate.gov/hearings/housing-finance-reform-next-steps). The witnesses are high level: Steve Mnuchin (Secretary of the Treasury), Ben Carson (Secretary of HUD), and the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. This could play into the long-rumored plans to privatize the two mortgage-finance giants that are [Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (paywall)](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-administration-aims-to-privatize-fannie-mae-and-freddie-mac-11567717213). \n\nThe Senate will hold joint committee hearings on [making it more affordable to raise a family](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/hearings-calendar?ID=5CA925C6-7E7B-4791-A193-9D40CCD5C19E). Not much will probably emerge, but it's interesting that it's starting in the Republican-controlled Senate. Obviously, signalling any sort of requirements for family leave, etc. would be bad across the board, but increasing the child-tax credit or other tax mechanisms could be good in the macroeconomic sense.\n\nOne I haven't seen before: the [Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe](https://www.csce.gov) is going to hold hearings on examining the autocratic abuse of INTERPOL. This reads to me as a not-so-veiled barb at China, where a Communist Party politician allegedly [took bribes as head of INTERPOL](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-47718827). Given the frazzled trade environment, and the furor that resulted from the [Canadian/Huawei extradition row](https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/21/business/huawei-meng-wanzhou-extradition/index.html), this might be a spillover event.\n\n***\n\nFinally, a word of warning to big tech longs. State attorneys general have begun their own [antitrust investigations into big tech (paywall)](https://www.wsj.com/articles/states-to-launch-google-facebook-antitrust-probes-11567762204), along with the upcoming hearings mentioned in the House and Senate, the big one of which will happen in the [Senate on 9/24](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/competition-in-digital-technology-markets-examining-acquisitions-of-nascent-or-potential-competitors-by-digital-platforms). More importantly, the recent trend has seemed to be that &lt;Executive&gt; action is announced around the dates of the hearings. Obviously, the macroeconomic environment with the rate cut is more important in the short-run, but I'd seriously pause before establishing new long positions before the end of the month.", "created_utc": 1567786822, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d0iui3/congressional_activity_week_of_99_to_913/", "is_self": true}
