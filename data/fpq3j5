The entire market cap of my country's stock market is around $2 trillion, yes legit Microsoft and Alphabet alone can fuck us.\nWe fell 35% ever since someone in China ate a dead bat's dick and all 1.3 billion of us shmuks have been put on complete lockdown for 21 days. \nPeople are losing jobs, banks are gonna have a shit ton of defaults, and our population might now just explode 9months from now. \nBut our stocks have been rising for the past 3 trading sessions and I have no idea why!\nOur FIIs and DIIs are selling shit everyday but still we rise just like DOW. So retards here love the Dow and stalk it as if its their wife's boyfriend. But with Covid cases going up in the USA and unemployment rising like crazy why is the Dow so fucking happy?\nCan you retards teach me something about why the markets in my country have suddenly started rising?\nIs this a trap or are we just gonna get back to normal in 20 days?", "created_utc": 1585280950.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpq3j5/teach_me_some_stonks_dads/", "is_self": true}
