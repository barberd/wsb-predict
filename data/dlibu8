Here's the play.", "selftext": "I just bought some shares in this company, but that's irrelevant. \n\nCompany is not profitable, strong cash position, thrives on poor people and people needed a small secondary income. They convert the plasma from blood and give it to sick people and at HUGE cost to medical providers and insurance companies. \n\nI have donated plasma before when I was poor and still do it because its so easy while helping people.\n\nThe play\n\nYou buy HAE, you go to their clinics, you get paid from their clinics to donate plasma, you average up or down on stock and calls = profit.\n\nIt's real life dividend. \n\nNo joke though its like $70 a week and sometimes they provide incentives. It's roughly an extra 3,000 a year for poor families and the donation lines are out the door.", "created_utc": 1571752776, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dlibu8/hae_haemonetics_a_blood_plasma_company_heres_the/", "is_self": true}
