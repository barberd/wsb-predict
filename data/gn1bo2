I will admit that I was kind of hoping to put that to rest and be able to double my income, but the unfortunate reality is that I cannot.\n\nToday was by far the worst day of me day trading so far, and a myriad of issues came up that really prevented me from not only getting out of bad decisions, but making bad ones worse. At this point I have completely lost all of the gains that I made in my first 3 days, which while is disappointing, there's also strangely freeing? I definitely feel bad about it but I feel less bad about this than I did yesterday when I lost \\~$100.\n\nToday I got off to a bad start, not going in on my trading plan with DDOG and TWLO at the entry point that I wanted, completely ignored DDOG to my misfortune and focused on TWLO, which is where I made my biggest error day trading so far. I was trying to set up a limit order that would go into effect if TWLO went up to a certain price point. Unfortunately I set it up incorrectly, and ended up purchasing a contract well above its current mark price. I ended up taking a $100 loss on that one, because TWLO proceeded to go in the opposite direction. I then tried a little later on TWLO, but ended up losing that as well. And that was really the day, everything else was that mistake compounded again and again and again.\n\nTomorrow I am going to do my best to execute my morning trading plan - which is to look at DDOG, TWLO, AMZN, FB, and MAYBE Netflix, all of which I think have upside potential within the first 30 minutes or so. We shall see which I end up entering\n\nI think coming out of today I have learned two lessons.\n\n1. I need to stick to my strategy, it actively inhibits my worst instincts, and keeps me out of trouble. Today I was really tired of watching my stops hit and then seeing something go up afterwards, so I tried to let things run instead of stopping out. This ended up costing me big time in several plays.\n2. My recent losses have made me gun-shy to hop onto things that I think are going to go well, and it's actively making me avoid hopping on trends when I see them. The reason this is an issue is because I keep watching the stock, wait for it to come to a plateau, buy in then - and watch my profits get eaten away as the IV goes down and it reverses direction I'm basically putting myself in the worst position of catching the falling knife - literally catching it after its gone through my hands and into my toe.\n3. I need to get more sleep and wake up earlier. I spent this morning making mistakes that cost me because I was tired and not able to focus. I need to get to sleep sooner and wake up better in the morning. \n\nDay 7: 5/19 -19.40% ($2364.82 - $1904.13)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mf32an52htz41.png?width=1258&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a2927492a316018818b97fa94faf4039c80f5fa\n\nDay 6: 5/18 -4.98% ($2489.82 - $2364.82)\n\n|Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|BA 5/22 140c|\\+ $7|2|$183|$188|\n|DDOG 6/19 75c|$0|2|$285|$285|\n|DIS 5/22 122c|\\-$14|1|$66|$52|\n|JD 5/22 55c|\\-$3|1|$129|$126|\n|LRCX 5/22 280c|\\+$12|2|$100|$106|\n|LUV 5/29 27c|\\+$2|1|$98|$100|\n|NVDA 5/22 400c|\\-$26|1|$266|$240|\n|PDD 5/22 75c|\\+$15|1|$140|$155|\n|VTIQ 6/19 25c|\\-$44|1|$309|$265|\n|W 5/22 125p|\\-$27|1|$135|$108|\n|ZS 5/22 77.5c|\\-$30|1|$165|$135|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDay 5: 5/15 -6.57% ($2665.08 - $2489.82)\n\n|Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|BYND 5/22 120P|\\-$18|1|$186|$168|\n|JD 5/22 50C|\\-$14|1|$134|$120|\n|JD 5/22 51C|\\+$1|1|$120|$121|\n|NEM 5/22 68.5C|\\-$23|1|$179|$159|\n|TWLO 5/22 205C|\\-$49|1|$400|$351|\n|TWTR 5/22 30C|\\+$30|3|$73|$78|\n|UBER 5/22 33C|\\-$12|2|$109|$103|\n|VTIQ 6/19 30C|\\-$4|1|$285|$281|\n|WIX 6/19 240C|\\-$55|1|$419|$364|\n|WORK 5/22 32C|\\-$13|1|$129|$116|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDay 4: 5/14 +9.96% ($1968.86 - $2165.08)\n\n|Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|TWLO 5/22 200c|\\-$26|1|$425|$399|\n|BAC 5/15 21C|\\+$63|3|$41|$62|\n|GS 5/15 172.5C|\\+$46|2|$183|$206|\n|JPM 5/15 87C|\\+$135|5|$68|$95|\n|LCRX 5/15 270C|\\-$77|1|$342|$265|\n|MS 5/15 37.5C|\\+$10|5|$44|$46|\n|WFC 5/15 24C|\\+$67|3|$41|$63.5|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDay 3: 5/13 +8.35% - $1356.57 - $1469.84\n\n|Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|CODX 6/19 20C|\\-$22|1|$277|$255|\n|TWLO 5/22 200C|\\+$174|1|$469|$643|\n|DDOG 5/15 70C|\\+$45|1|$200|$245|\n|NVDA 5/15 335C|\\-$39|1|$213|$174|\n|ZM 5/15 180C|\\-$39|1|$180|$141|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDay 2: 5/12 +29.53% - $1046.34 - $1356.57\n\n|Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|CRM 6/19 200C|\\+2|1|$263|$265|\n|EGHT 6/19 20C|\\+59|1|$191|$250|\n|TWLO 5/29 205C|\\+30|1|$370|$400|\n|VTIQ 5/15 30C|\\+224|2|$103|$215|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDay 1: 5/11 +5% - $1000.89 - $1046.34\n\n|Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|DDOG 5/15 55c|\\+54|1|$380|$434|\n|CSCO 5/15 44.5c|\\-16|2|$214|$198|\n|CHWY 5/15 39.5c|\\+12|1|$134|$146|", "created_utc": 1589935867.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gn1bo2/day_7_516_from_down_to_up_the_road_to_1838537/", "is_self": true}
