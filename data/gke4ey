{"id": "gke4ey", "title": "Synthetic Options 101", "selftext": "What is a Synthetic Call?\n\nA synthetic call is an options strategy that uses stock shares and put option to simulate the performance of a call option. This gives the investor a theoretically unlimited growth potential with a specific limit to the amount risked.\n\nHow a Synthetic Call Works\n\nA synthetic call, also referred to as a synthetic long call, begins with an investor buying an holding shares. The investor also purchases an\u00a0at-the-money\u00a0put option on the same stock to protect against depreciation in the stock's price. Most investors think this strategy can be considered similar to an insurance policy against the stock dropping precipitously during the duration that they hold the shares.\n\nA synthetic call is also known as a married put or protective put. The synthetic call is a bullish strategy used when the investor is concerned about potential near-term uncertainties in the stock. By owning the stock with a protective\u00a0put option, the investor still receives the benefits of stock ownership, such as receiving dividends and holding the right to vote.\u00a0In contrast, just owning a\u00a0call option, while equally as bullish as owning the stock, does not bestow the same benefits of stock ownership.\u00a0\n\nBoth a synthetic call and a long call have the same unlimited profit potential since there is no ceiling on the price appreciation of the\u00a0underlying\u00a0stock. However, profit is always lower than it would be by just owning the stock. An investor's profit decreases by the cost or\u00a0premium\u00a0of the put option purchased. Therefore, one reaches breakeven for the strategy when the underlying stock rises by the amount of the options premium paid. Anything above that amount is profit.\n\nThe benefit is from a floor which is now under the stock. The floor\u00a0limits any\u00a0downside risk\u00a0to the difference between the price of the underlying stock at the time of the purchase of the synthetic call and the\u00a0strike price. Put another way, at the time of the purchase of the option, if the underlying stock traded precisely at the strike price, the loss for the strategy is capped at exactly the price paid for the option.\n\nWhen to Use a Synthetic Call\n\nRather than a profit-making strategy, a synthetic call is a capital-preserving strategy. Indeed, the cost of the put portion of the approach becomes a built-in cost. The option's cost reduces the profitability of the approach, assuming the underlying stock moves higher, the desired direction. Therefore, investors should use a synthetic call as an insurance policy against near-term uncertainty in an otherwise\u00a0bullish\u00a0stock, or as protection against an unforeseen price\u00a0breakdown.\u00a0\n\nNewer investors may benefit from knowing that their losses in the stock market are limited. This\u00a0safety net can give them confidence as they learn more about different investing strategies. Of course, any protection comes at a cost, which includes the price of the\u00a0option,\u00a0commissions, and possibly other fees.\n\nWhat Is a Synthetic Put?\n\nA synthetic put is an options strategy that combines a\u00a0short\u00a0stock position with a\u00a0long call option\u00a0on that same stock to mimic a\u00a0long put option. It is also called a synthetic long put. Essentially, an investor who has a short position in a stock purchases an\u00a0at-the-money\u00a0call option on that same stock. This action is taken to protect against appreciation in the stock's price.\u00a0A synthetic put is also known as a married call or protective call.\u00a0\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\nA synthetic put is an options strategy that combines a short stock position with a long call option on that same stock to mimic a long put option.\n\nSynthetic put is a strategy that investors can utilize when they have a bearish bet on a stock and are concerned about potential\u00a0near-term strength in that stock.\n\nA synthetic put's goal is to profit from the anticipated decline in the underlying stock's price, which is why it is often called a synthetic long put.\n\nUnderstanding Synthetic Puts\n\nThe synthetic put is a strategy that investors can utilize when they have a\u00a0bearish\u00a0bet on a stock and are concerned about potential\u00a0near-term strength in that stock.\u00a0It is similar to an insurance policy except that the investor wants the price of the underlying stock to fall, not rise. The strategy combines the\u00a0short sale\u00a0of a security with a long-call position on the same security.\n\nA synthetic put mitigates the risk that the underlying price will increase. It does not, however, deal with other dangers, which may leave\u00a0the investor exposed.\u00a0Because it involves a short position in the underlying stock, it carries with it all the associated risks of an adverse, or up-market, move. Risks include fees, margin interest, and the possibility of having to pay\u00a0dividends\u00a0to the investor from whom the shares were borrowed to sell short.\u00a0\n\nInstitutional investors can use synthetic puts to disguise their trading bias, be it bullish or bearish, on specific securities. However, for most investors, synthetic puts are best suited for use as an insurance policy. An increase in\u00a0volatility\u00a0would be beneficial to this strategy while\u00a0time decay\u00a0would impact it negatively.\n\nBoth a simple short position and a synthetic put have their maximum profit if the stock's value falls to zero. However, any benefit from the synthetic put must be\u00a0reduced by the price, or\u00a0premium,\u00a0which the investor paid for the\u00a0call option\n\nThe synthetic put strategy can place a practical ceiling, or cap, on the price of the stock for a 'fee', the options premium. The cap limits any\u00a0upside\u00a0risk for the investor. The risk is limited to the difference between the price at which the underlying stock was shorted and the option's\u00a0strike price\u00a0and any commissions. Put another way, at the time of the purchase of the option, if the price at which the investor shorted the stock was equal to the strike price, the loss for the strategy would be the premiums paid for the option.\n\nMaximum Gain = Short sale price - Lowest stock price (ZERO) - Premiums\n\nMaximum Loss = Short sale price - Long Call Strike price - Premiums\n\nBreakeven Point = Short sale price - Premiums\n\nWhen to Use a Synthetic Put\n\nRather than a profit-making strategy, a synthetic put is a capital-preserving strategy. Indeed, the cost of the call portion of the approach becomes a built-in cost. The\u00a0option's\u00a0price reduces the profitability of the method, assuming the underlying stock moves in the desired direction lower lower. Therefore, investors should use a synthetic put as an insurance policy against near-term strength in an otherwise bearish stock, or as a protection against an unforeseen price explosion higher.\u00a0\n\nNewer investors may benefit from knowing that their losses in the stock market are limited.

Of course, any protection will come\u00a0at a cost, which includes the price of the option,\u00a0commissions, and possibly other fees.", "created_utc": 1589565752.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gke4ey/synthetic_options_101/", "is_self": true}
