Pence announced that he is lifting restrictions which were preventing patients being tested even with doctors orders. Over the next few days fully expect upwards of a 50% increase in the amount of people being tested as 15,000 new test kits sent out and production ramped up significantly creating a much higher rate at which cases will be confirmed.  \n\n\nI think that over the next two weeks we will see the USA move towards one of the highest infected areas in the world based purely on how poor testing has been done previously - resulting in many unconfirmed cases. Expect more volatile times ahead.   \n\n\nTLDR: More testing kits + Less restrictions = More confirmations = more work shutdowns = tendies on puts.   \n\n\nTLDR the TLDR: More cough = More puts", "created_utc": 1583285789.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fd5ebn/restrictions_removed_allowing_patients_to_be/", "is_self": true}
