{"id": "gusy54", "title": "$ZM will get crushed tomorrow", "selftext": "Love seeing the bullish posts and comments on ZM after a record day. New ATH, off of 13.75% rise in a single day. For those of you brave enough to buy calls on a company with P/E > 2k, well done. \n\nThat said, the fact that a majority of WSB is bullish on ZM, reinforces my stance on ZM crashing hard tomorrow and even harder after a lack luster earnings.\n\nFor all you new folk, let\u2019s remember one thing... the people who ACTUALLY have money, know every bit of PUBLIC information you know. (Users increasing, cost for a sub, expenses, etc) Today was pure hype, and tomorrow will be the dump. \n\nZM has competition stacking almost on a weekly basis. They have not monetized the free user. \n\nThere\u2019s no situation where ZM comes out on top of earnings and the stock somehow soars to another new ATH. UNLESS, Donny announces $ZM will be the new standard for the US govt, my crayons all point to a downward trend starting around 9am PST tomorrow. \n\n20x 175/170p debit spread.", "created_utc": 1591045279.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gusy54/zm_will_get_crushed_tomorrow/", "is_self": true}
