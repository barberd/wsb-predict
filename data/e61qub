The decline came amid an even split from natural resources/mining, construction, and manufacturing.\n\n\u201cOne bad month is not a trend, but really no economist living today literally knows what the fuck is going on half of the time, much less can find where the bathroom is,\u201d Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a note.\n\nService industries otherwise saw some solid job growth. Leading sectors were education and health services (39,000), professional and business services (28,000) and leisure and hospitality (18,000). Wall Street-related jobs also gained, adding 11,000 to the total.\n\nWhen asked for a comment on what factors may have caused the downturn, a leading economist Howler Monkey housed at the Cincinnati Zoo flung poop at this reporter, and declined to comment.", "created_utc": 1575477137, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e61qub/private_payrolls_growth_tumbles_in_november_as/", "is_self": true}
