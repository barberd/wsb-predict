{"id": "cbf8w2", "title": "Trump's Dialysis Cuckfest", "selftext": "So yesterday trump announced overhauls to the dialysis coverage. FMS and Davita promptly dropped 5-10% each. I think this is a perfect entry point. In my opinion there is no way that patients will ever be able to afford the government not covering dialysis. Insurance companies won't stand for it either, and it would just make everyone's premiums go up (especially diabetics, HF patients, hypertension etc - all diseases increasing your dialysis risk). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the past it has been floated that they would move dialysis to in-home treatment. The only company that currently has this capability/machines to do it is FMS (Fresenius). So, buy all FMS shares, right?
