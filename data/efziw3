{"id": "efziw3", "title": "Leveraged gold etf, NUGT is the way to go on the metal breakouts", "selftext": "Simple as the title. Calls on the NUGT are up 1000%+ this week. The $33 calls were at .01 per contract on Friday and hit over 1.8 per contract today. That\u2019s an over 180x return on investment. Not too in depth DD here but look at chart breakout levels. NUGT has predictable support and resistance levels intraday that you can trade off of.
