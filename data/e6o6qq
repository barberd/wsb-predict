Here\u2019s the idea:\n\nWe all combine our money into a joint investment account. I\u2019ll do some A level investment magic using a never before seen infinite leverage glitch, and then turn our money into trillions! Once we do that, we just buy all the companies in the world. \n\nBut why should you guys trust me in that this will work? Well, for starters, I\u2019m not an autistic mf like you guys. I\u2019m also a CS and econ student at UIUC which means I\u2019m automatically a genius even though my gpa is 1.8.
