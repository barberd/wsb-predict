Favorite company", "selftext": "Tesla bullish thesis. \n\nExxon mobile and chevron are both huge energy companies that are oil they sell gas to fill up your ice (internal combustion engine) they make money on this process of refining and delivering it the Exxon gas tank and then u pay like 2$ a gallon but it cost them like 1.40$ maybe idk. Tesla has super charges which are \u201cgas stations\u201d for electric cars. Tesla has spent a lot of time and money to install these all of the USA and now their are over 10,000 or something, Tesla charges money for this service after the 6 month period of buying your new car this will become a profit engine soon similar to Exxon gas stations. \n\nTesla and solar energy and power, Tesla will make solar roof tills which they are focusing more time on now they have got the model 3 production working well and are a profitable company, solar city to be exact is the company Tesla owns, in my neighborhood about a year or two ago solar city started installing solar panels for free with the constraint that they would use the energy and money saved on the electric bill and pay it back to solar city, so now this is gonna become a profitable thing sense the solar panels are already installed, but the thing is Tesla wants to make solar roof tiles which are gonna be new and improve and very innovative/expensive. Think about it though Tesla could become the company to power your house, charge your Tesla car, and maybe air conditioning.(Elon wants to do this)\n\nTesla the car business. Tesla has a huge advantage over a lot of the regular car companies they have established the manufacturing process, profitable, and reliable cool cars. Competition will soon creep in similar to Walmart, target, Macy, and other retailers with amazon and fighting for online retail. Amazon took over the online retail got far ahead and then it was to late for other to stop them, mean while amazon ran at very lot profitability and actually makes most of their money from aws. Tesla is profitable, and Tesla is doing cars what amazon did to retail. \n\nTesla the brand. Tesla is selling merchandise such as shirts and jackets and surfboards this is a straight profit engine and makes very loyal customers. Tesla merchandise is close/could be a hype brand like supreme that actually makes sense. Supreme is skate shop and people buy this stuff without even owning a skateboard \ud83d\udef9. Tesla merchandise could become this but people probably would still try and buy a car. \n\nTesla is the most innovative large cap company right now. They are now profitable, they have growing revenue, and are now going global with making a hogs factor in China. Which is huge eliminating tariffs by making the cars in China and selling them there. Tesla is also selling their cars into Europe which is gonna be a huge market to break threw considering Europe love BMW and Mercedes. If they can sell a lot of cars into Europe (seems to be going well so far) then this proves they can beat or at least remain dominate in the ev car market. \n\nThis is the main points for Tesla. \n\nMain fears about Tesla \n\nElon Musk getting into legal trouble/ leaving Tesla in any way\n\nRecession happens and they struggle to sell cars and go bankrupt \n\nIf people don\u2019t buy Tesla\u2019s or don\u2019t care about cars that much to buy a ev\n\n\nImagine \nElon musk/Tesla/spacex taking over the world and then colonizing mars and making humans multi planet \ud83c\udf0d \n\nExcuse spelling or any facts slightly off", "created_utc": 1553396145, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b4rn6n/rant_on_tesla_favorite_company/", "is_self": true}
