{"id": "esit41", "title": "SPY Puts", "selftext": "Ok, I know what you\u2019re thinking: It\u2019s a scummy bear, one of those people who wants me to lose money and for the world to end.\n\nThis is not the case. I\u2019m actually bullish on the market and my year end price target for $SPY is 340.\n\nHowever, we have come up too far, too fast. Since October 8th, $SPY is up 15% despite earnings growth this quarter being negative. \n\nPEG and PE ratios, despite being a stereotype statistic for bears, does have powerful predictive powers over the market and these ratios are reaching highs not seen in years.\n\nThe average RSI reading for the past three months is 68, whereas 70 represents extremely overbought levels. Usually 70 is a level only achieved for short periods of time at a rallies peak, but we have held this metric for months. \n\nCompany earnings are up 1% since the start of 2019 while the market, even if measured at the most favorable point of the 2018 peak is still up 12%.\n\nWhile I believe this year will be a positive one, we have come into this year with far too much momentum and I think today\u2019s intraday trading pattern exemplifies that we are starting to slow down and turn the other way. We were at a 0.5% gain and trading strongly before investors started to sell throughout the day and into the close. This strongly contrasts with what has become the recent norm, trading up through the day and at least up into the close.\n\nThis leads me to how I\u2019m trading this.\n\nI believe the market will decline at least 5% within the next month, so I modeled my options positions to be nicely profitable in those conditions.\n\nFirstly, I took positions in the VXX Feb 21 16 Call, which is currently trading for $40. If the market drops 5%, VXX (which currently trades at 13.55) would hit 19.10, representing a 775% return for the option which would effectively trade at $310. I modeled this price for the VXX based off the decline in August of last year.\n\nSecondly, I took positions in the SPY Feb 21 325 Put. This option currently trades for $230. SPY currently trades at 331.31. If the market dropped 5%, the option would be worth $1,025, representing a 445% return.\n\nEssentially, the combined profit (after subtracting your initial investment) would be $1,065 with a risk of $270, or a nearly 400% profit off of a completely reasonable drop of 5%. No one made a big deal about this when it happened in August, as these things are normal.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t want to inspire greed, but that\u2019s if the market drops just 5%. If the market were to drop like it did in February 2018, your profit would ballon to nearly 1,100% of your initial investment.\n\nI have about 7.5% of my portfolio invested in these options, and almost want to YOLO my entire account and see what happens. I\u2019m sixteen years old, so I could probably make the money back, yeah?", "created_utc": 1579729658, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/esit41/spy_puts/", "is_self": true}
