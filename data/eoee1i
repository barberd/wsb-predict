My theory back then was that tradedeal.exe would not go well hence my bets. AAPL was at 225, QCOM was at 72 and so on. All my calls were in the ATM. So as the wall street bets story goes, my options expired worthless. \n\nIt was around the same time banks were reporting earnings, bad call on my part. It's very reminiscent to earnings for banks set to release all week, starting tomorrow.\n\nI have a two part theory and it can go either way. \n\nA) Trump has insider info that bank earnings will either be bad or good, but in any case the guidance will suck nuts. hence the euphoria with calls will come to a sudden end, and the market makers will have a great reason to dump on us retail folks.  \n\nTrump, knowing this information has tradedealsigned.exe ready for deployment day after bad guidance. \n\nB) Bank earnings  and guidance will be great but tradedeal.exe will suck nuts and market makers will use this as an excuse to take profit and dump on retail investors. \n\nEither way I see some dumping going on within the next few days. \n\nHere's a 20 pound grain of salt, enjoy.", "created_utc": 1578967181, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eoee1i/donald_trump_conspiracy/", "is_self": true}
