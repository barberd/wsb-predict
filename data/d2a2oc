{"id": "d2a2oc", "title": "Apple announcing the acquisition of Snapchat today?", "selftext": "For those who don't follow unusual options activity, large swaths of call option contracts were purchased last week, yesterday, and today for Snapchat -- thousands of OTM contracts that expire this Friday and next Friday. Snap was flying high last week, but yesterday Snap fell roughly 8% and today it's down another 4% -- yet more large blocks of calls are being purchased well out of the money, expiring within days. They're not part of a straddle.\n\nSomeone has conviction and/or a gambling issue (maybe both?).\n\nAnyway, who's buying these calls? More important, what catalyst could be coming for Snapchat, if any? Well, I think Apple will announce that the \"one more thing today\" is the acquisition of Snapchat. Here's why:\n\n\\- Apple sent out a press invitation announcing today's event with a 3Dish Apple logo with 5 colors. People always look for clues in these invites -- the 3Dish appearance and the colors are clues. The 3D is probably alluding to the push into AR -- Apple thinks AR is the future, as does Snap.\n\n[https://9to5mac.com/2019/08/29/apple-event-invite-speculation/](https://9to5mac.com/2019/08/29/apple-event-invite-speculation/)\n\nThere are 5 colors -- these 5 colors are the same exact colors Snapchat uses in their branding guidelines. You can see it right here: [https://kit.snapchat.com/docs/design-guidelines](https://kit.snapchat.com/docs/design-guidelines)\n\nLook at the comparison: [https://imgur.com/a/c9gWHyQ](https://imgur.com/a/c9gWHyQ)\n\nYellow is Snap's primary color, obviously -- which is centered in the Apple icon in the invitation -- and the other 4 colors are the other 4 colors that Snap uses in design elements. No more, no less.\n\n\\- Evan, $SNAP founder, has fought off being acquired up to this point, but it's no secret Snapchat has had an uphill battle for monetization and the stock has gone no where. The company value/stock isn't even in the \"floundering like Uber/Lyft\" range, it's hanging out in the \"LOL we gunna git you Gamestop\" range.\n\nSnap has put up a good fight. It's okay to sell now.\n\n\\- Most analysts think $SNAP will be purchased within the next 1-2 years by Apple or Amazon. Whoever ends up purchasing Snap, they'll need to be able to market their own services/products directly to Snap's users to be able to justify the purchase and extract the most value out of the acquisition. Third-party ads aren't enough, as Snap knows.\n\n\\- Snap is the instant social network that Apple has long wanted. Apple knows they can't create one from scratch without burning a mountain of cash anyway -- even if they do, there's no guarantee a new social network (see Google's 14 attempts). Apple knows they have to buy their way into an existing social network.\n\n\\- Sexting jokes aside, Snapchat has a great fit for Apple's brand. Snapchat has a great demographic for Apple's products and services, a devote following, a relatively scandal-free history, and a very simple UX, which I think is the most important for Apple aside from the users. It's a blank canvas in more ways than one for Apple to do its thing.\n\n\\- Apple is pushing its new and/or improved subscription services -- music, tv, games -- the more social it can make each one and the more integrated they can make it all, the more traction and success each one will have. People want to listen to music \"together,\" watch TV together, and it's especially true that people want to play games together w/ friends.\n\nImagine logging into an Apple-owned Snapchat -- \"Kelly is listening to X on Apple Music\" click here to listen/subscribe, \"Kelly is watching Y\" click here to watch/subscribe, \"Kelly is playing Z on Apple Games\" click here to play/subscribe. Apple could go a step further and detect the music being played in the background video uploaded to Snapchat -- an extremely common thing -- and offer the name/link to that song in Apple Music. That's great monetization.\n\n\\- Apple has +/- $300b in the bank. Snap would probably go for $30-$50b. Okay.\n\n\\- Evan has a picture of Steve Jobs hanging in his office, allegedly. He loves Apple, at least its founder, allegedly.\n\n\\- That last point was really piss-poor DD. It's Wallstreetbets though, so I figured I'd throw it in. While I'm at it, I think I heard Evan ate an apple the other day. Coincidence? I doubt it.\n\n\\- Once two companies announce a merger/acquisition, you can typically go back through public comments/statements made by the companies months leading up to the announcement and see a lot of similarities. Both Snap and Apple have talked a lot about AR \"being the future\" lately. Among other AR-projects, rumors are that Apple has a Tile-like competitor being announced today that will visually show you where your item is in your house. Snap just announced AR glasses.\n\n\\- Speaking of Snap's AR glasses, [https://www.spectacles.com/](https://www.spectacles.com/) \\-- this site/design doesn't fit with the styling or feel of Snapchat's other web properties (like [Snapchat.com](https://snapchat.com/)) -- it feels more like something that was produced with Apple. You could add an Apple logo to every page and Apple wouldn't change much else after an acquisition. Scroll through [Spectacles.com](https://spectacles.com/) and then scroll through product pages on [Apple.com](https://apple.com/), it feels incredibly similar.\n\n\\- Apple was recently asked why they're hiring engineers in Seattle -- Apple gave no comment. Snap also has a growing office in Seattle, presumably for AR -- they're hiring a lot of engineers for that office right now. There's absolutely no way two tech companies are hiring engineers in Seattle at the same time... /s\n\nTLDR: Buy puts today, Apple ain't buying Snapchat cause some colors match up. If it does though, and it's Apple's \"one last thing,\" then you heard it here first.", "created_utc": 1568132908, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d2a2oc/apple_announcing_the_acquisition_of_snapchat_today/", "is_self": true}
