Update from the gay bear throwing the towel last week", "selftext": "[I posted this last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gx54sz/gay_bear_throwing_the_towel/)\n\nThat I sold most of my short positions because ANY bad or good news makes the stonks only go up. I loaded up on sp500 ETF and World ETFs. I'm already down 7% from last week.\n\nIf we start hitting the Circuit breakers on Monday I will just freak out. How is it possible that I waited 3 F* months with my shorts and sold them a week before the (possible) biggest bull trap end? \n\nI can't be a Bull for the next months and then miss another V recovery. It doesn't compute\n\nFML.
