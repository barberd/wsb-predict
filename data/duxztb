{"id": "duxztb", "title": "NVFY DD", "selftext": "A few weeks ago I spoke to the investor relations manager for Nova Lifestyle (which is a net-net at a steep discount to NCAV) and after some back and forth he said that management had decided as of their last report that cash is better used to grow sales rather than return it to shareholders. Buybacks have been authorized, and about $100k worth was repurchased as of the last report. \n\nI've done some scouting on their Wayfair page, which has about 80 reviews for this fiscal period. Assuming 5-10% of customers leave a review, which is extremely high, this represents between 800-1600 sales on Wayfair at an average price in the mid-100s (I calculated ~$520). \n\nThis places Wayfair total sales for the quarter in the half-million dollar range, or $2mm on an annualized basis. Wayfair, to my knowledge, is a secondary sales channel. These figures set us up for an earnings beat, and hopefully the stock will pop.", "created_utc": 1573502544, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/duxztb/nvfy_dd/", "is_self": true}
