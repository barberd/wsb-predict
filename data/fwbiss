TOGETHER\n\nLet me start by a quick disclamer, yeah i\u2019m \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b but more over i\u2019m about the tendies on either side of the fences... that\u2019s why I loaded my shit from now up until\nJanuary... \n\nYou guys can read... I believe and hope so... the fucking news... are things good right now? Are you planning to hit the beach or disney next week? Next month?? 3 months?? Fuck I have a cruise from NY to the Bahamas in September with a fucking brand new RC ship and shit I\u2019m not even sure i\u2019ll be able to go... \n\nSo without getting into the boring stuff about NY death case still fucking UP, case still sky rocketing but hey we\u2019ve peaked in NY... yeah one day slow down and we peaked... very scientific assessment...\n\nThat bring me to talk about band-aid....\n\nThere are a whole lot of fucking band-aid in the US economy right now... this whole talks about peaking... is a huge fucking bandaid on a knee where the rest of the leg have been chug off... and at some point in a not so distant futures... what happen when we say mmmmm not sure why .... it\u2019s still bleeding... bandaid didn\u2019t work out.. mmm\n\nWe can talk about the mortage bandaid...\n\nThe fed NOT stimulus but SURVIVAL package bandaid...\n\nThe\u00a0 \u00ab\u00a0we are making tremedous progress on a cure... i got a good feeling about chloroquine\u00a0\u00bb more fucking bandaid... \n\nThey trow so much stuff like let\u2019s trow money there... huge amount... let\u2019s huge specific words to not create panic... let\u2019s spread false hope that we are gonna reopen for buisness for easter...\n\nWhat happens when you rip off 1 or 2 bandaids and realize ohh shootsss ... having the whole economy at stop for this long kinda fucks us...\n\nOnly way out of this is a vaccine\n\nForget about mass imunity... not happening... they\u2019re trying it in sweden and japan and look how it\u2019s turning for them... they gonna get fucked 100x harder..\n\nSo anyway [here\u2019s a nice chat from MiDAS letter about this](https://midasletter.com/2020/04/will-this-stock-market-rally-continue/) canadian stock market not reporter but let\u2019s say they bring up some stuff discuss about it and heck... been following thoses guys for a while and more often than otherwise they get it right!\n\nSo what you think?? \n\nTL DR: I\u2019m happy for any bull making tendies... PLZ \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb take profit and don\u2019t get burn... when truth start showing and the worst one is the mortage one (they told it\u2019s on the brink of mass chaos) we\u2019re going down in the abyss (i\u2019m not rejoicing about this... yes I\u2019ll print massively but I don\u2019t want to be right on this one) \n\nPositions: You guys know em ... SPY 250-200-150-25...yes 25 spare change wild bet playing the Vix... from april 24 to january ... and some other DIS BAC TSLA\n\nEdit 1; forgot the best part... what do you think Trump and Pence are actually saying to each other behind closed doors (other than the \ud83c\udf08 stuff) ... I don\u2019t think they are saying... ah the people... we\u2019ll save them... everything is gonna be okay for the boomers... it\u2019s more like damn we\u2019re so fucked... why this had to happen before the re \u00e9lection... how do we damage\nControl this? \n\nThat\u2019s it\n\nEdit 2: i\u2019m not seeing how and i\u2019m really meaning this ... how can someone be bullish right now... and not bullish about making quick cash but going out there and say yep we\u2019re back in bull market for another 10 years....
