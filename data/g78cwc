{"id": "g78cwc", "title": "A Less Retarded Way to Be a Bear", "selftext": "Tired of getting ass blasted by Powell on your puts? Stop bearing a retarded bear and smarten up.\n\nLarge funds have \"risk on\" positions (stocks, credit) and \"risk off\" positions (treasuries, gold). When a large money manager gets bearish they usually don't just go short because that's usually a dumb idea, instead they go long Treasuries and if rates are artificially low because of the Fed they will buy gold. Look at a portfolio of 50% Gold and 50% 30 year treasuries and you can see how it generally does well during market turmoil, but doesn't get crushed during market recoveries. GLD and TLT are fine ETFs for this.\n\nInstead of just buying puts on SPY and getting crushed by Theta, express part of your bearishness by writing put spreads on TLT and GLD, and or going long vertical call spreads. Doing this is going bearish in a way endorsed by J-Powell because the more money he prints it will be driving down interest rates and pumping up gold.\n\nFor me personally, I am doing this by writing May 15 put spreads on both TLT and GLD to benefit from theta.", "created_utc": 1587734851.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g78cwc/a_less_retarded_way_to_be_a_bear/", "is_self": true}
