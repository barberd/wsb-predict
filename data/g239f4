{"id": "g239f4", "title": "Natural Gas (NGK20) Play for Tomorrow - 4/16", "selftext": "I've seen this play posted already, but I want to elaborate and [take a side](https://imgur.com/a/v6gKigm) (sell-side) on this play for tomorrow. The Natural Gas storage report comes out tomorrow morning at 7:30 PST, and the expectation is that there will be more injection (increase) into the storage base for the commodity. Last week's report saw a 38 billion cubic feet (Bcf) increase in inventory of NG:\n\n[http://ir.eia.gov/ngs/ngs.html](http://ir.eia.gov/ngs/ngs.html)\n\nIf the expectation of injection is exceeded tomorrow, we should get a deeper runoff of NG futures, testing the recent lows for the commodity. And even if it meets the expectation, the data would supplement/confirm bearish sentiment for NG in the next month or two, which should contribute to further declines in the coming days. Bloomberg consensus estimates for Bcf injection is 42 to 78 Bcf. EWB analytics said they believe the front-month NG contract could establish a new low by the end of the week.\n\n[https://www.naturalgasintel.com/articles/121668-natural-gas-futures-down-early-as-demand-likely-to-plummet](https://www.naturalgasintel.com/articles/121668-natural-gas-futures-down-early-as-demand-likely-to-plummet)\n\nTLDR; If you are trying to use equities/options to play Natural Gas this week, Puts on UNG or short-sell UNG tomorrow morning in the first hour (if it doesn't open up low because of the expectation). Otherwise, sell-side futures contracts [like me](https://imgur.com/a/v6gKigm).\n\nProof of position:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/v6gKigm](https://imgur.com/a/v6gKigm)", "created_utc": 1586992900.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g239f4/natural_gas_ngk20_play_for_tomorrow_416/", "is_self": true}
