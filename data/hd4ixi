You are terribly wrong.\n\nIn fact, the TEDPIX (Tehran Stock Exchange Index) has gone from 549185 in March to 1270627 today. The TEDPIX increased 886528 or 230.81% since the beginning of 2020, according to trading on a contract for difference (CFD) that tracks this benchmark index from Iran [https://tradingeconomics.com/iran/stock-market](https://tradingeconomics.com/iran/stock-market)\n\nIt must be weird right? Seeing the Iran index going to the moon when the GDP is down 15% and inflation pass 40%, but this could be contributed to the more crazy brrr by the Iran central bank.\n\nThe latest liquidity figures released June 15 by the Central Bank of Iran show the volume of money in circulation in the country grew by 31 percent from March 2019 to March 2020.

Stonks go up.\n\n[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2)\n\nSo, Iran has been printing more money than ever and we haven\u2019t been able to see how much Iran is brrrr since March when the virus is beginning spreading like wildfire and closing down many businesses, while inflation is high the stock market goes higher.\n\nThis is why being a gay bear in the US could see blood on your bank account but being a gay bear in Iran could actually be murdered by the Iran central bank by literally throwing money at you in real life(coin forms of course) and your stock account going to negative\n\n[https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/06/14/countries-where-being-gay-is-legally-punishable-by-death/39574685/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/06/14/countries-where-being-gay-is-legally-punishable-by-death/39574685/)\n\nSo stop being a gay bear and prepare for the new highs as the Fed (owned by Donny now) would never ever allow it to go down at least before the elections, he could in fact send the stock market to new highs just to pump up the elections, remember Iran stock market just doubled since march.\n\nEDIT: Venezuela stock market up 1900% in 1 year.\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/IBVC:IND](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/IBVC:IND)\n\n**Caracas Stock Exchange Stock Market Index**\n\n1 Year Return 1,902.99%\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1592734144.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hd4ixi/case_study_from_iran_shows_that_stonks_only_go_up/", "is_self": true}
