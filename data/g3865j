This is just a little update on what I predicted was happening and how I see it playing out for the next few weeks. If you want to read my initial DD [here it is](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1rjwg/the_running_of_the_bulls_is_over_soon/).\n\nMost of you called me a retard as I would expect and made fun of technical analysis which is to be expected here, but update my points. \n\n1. **RETRACEMENT:** I expect to see no more than a 60-65% retracement from the lows before we continue our next leg down. That will happen when SPY is around **290-295.** \n2. **VOLUME:** It gets lower and lower every day. It's pretty insane if we compare it to our late February early March levels. [Here's a pretty picture.](https://imgur.com/a/2zFoiUb) Obviously this is very rough but you can see what I'm trying to get at. \n3. [ASCENDING WEDGE:](https://imgur.com/a/8vew4Rz) The ascending wedge which I've said is forming on $SPY is still going strong. \n\nIn summary, I think SPY is going to end its massive bull run soon. It will peak around 290-295 but don't be surprised if it goes as high as 300. This is where you should ask mom and dad for a loan and jack yourself to the fucking titties with SPY puts. This market is being held up on stilts (5% gain after a leaked video of a cure?? come on now)  I expect the next dip to be fairly large.\n\n**tl;dr: when we hit 295 $SPY 6/19 240Ps also fuck GILEAD lying fucks $GILD 5/1 75Ps**", "created_utc": 1587149946.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g3865j/the_running_of_the_bulls_is_over_pt_2/", "is_self": true}
