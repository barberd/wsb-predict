I thought I'd be safe, walking around bulltown again as a convert.\u00a0 It was nice for a while. I didn't lose much and most bulls were friendly to me.\u00a0 Accepting even. Sometimes I would regress back into my Bearish past but the support group was strong and pulled me back to my feet every time\n\nBut then the bears came back in force. I watched them ransack bulltown and take my friends, my wife, and even my wife's husband. A few survivors and I managed to hole up in a Microsoft store and radioed out for help. The nearby town of Zoom was the only town to respond but the residents were too high to realize the gravity of our situation.\u00a0 After a day, the bears still broke through our little barricade.\u00a0 They dragged us out onto the streets and made us watch them burn down our tiny bull convert village.\u00a0 First the airport, then the STNG store.\u00a0 I tried everything I could to escape.\u00a0 Even to tell them I was still a bear, but they didn't accept traitors.\u00a0 After humiliating my checking account in front of my own eyes and my captured bull compatriots, they started stomping on my knees screaming \"lmao bull r fuk\" and \"futures red\" before put me into a catapult and launched me.\u00a0\n\nWhen I woke, I was surrounded by all the bear and bull friends I had made along the way.\u00a0 No...these were the grandparents of all my bear/bull compatriots.\u00a0 They all\u00a0 smiled and in unison said,\u00a0 \"Welcome.\u00a0 I hope you're ready to work and invest long.\" I stared at them, digesting their words, as a tear rolled down my cheek.\u00a0\n\nA day later, I rolled out of the medical ward in a wheelchair. The doctor told me that I'd never be able to walk again and handed me a bill longer than a CVS receipt. No way I could afford this. My checking account had been stretched and emptied, looking more like a black hole than a wallet. Luckily, they called someone higher up and offered me a 0% interest rate for the next year on this bill. They even said there was potential for a negative interest rate.\n\nNow, I am in my wheelchair, pushing myself down the road while towing a stock heavy portfolio. It's slow progress, and sometimes I roll back down hills, but it's honest work. Though sometimes I swear I hear JPow's voice, whispering to me when the wind blows. \"Stonks only go up\"\n\nGodspeed to both bears and bulls. Clench those cheeks tight and your checking account tighter. I'm out the game, and over my tax deduction limit.", "created_utc": 1589471072.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gjotq3/jpow_took_my_cheeks_an_ode_to_bears_and_bulls/", "is_self": true}
