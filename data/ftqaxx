The small-business printer go brrrrrr thing? Yeah, not happening.**\n\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-stimulus-banks-exc/thousands-of-u-s-banks-may-sit-out-small-business-rescue-plan-on-liability-worries-sources-idUSKBN21K075\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Thousands of U.S. banks, including some of the country\u2019s largest lenders, have said they may not participate in the federal government\u2019s small-business rescue program due to concerns about taking on too much legal and financial risk, five people with direct knowledge of industry discussions told Reuters. \n\nSeeking to help millions of small businesses that have dramatically curtailed operations or shut down altogether during the coronavirus pandemic, Congress included $349 billion for small firms in its $2 trillion stimulus package passed last week. Small businesses, which will rely on banks to get the funds, employ about half of U.S. private sector employees, according to the Small Business Administration website.\n\nBorrowers can apply for the loans through participating banks starting from Friday and until June 30. Trump administration officials have said they want the loans disbursed within days.\n\nBut representatives of some major lenders, as well as thousands of community lenders, have expressed serious reservations about participating in the scheme in its current form and called that deadline totally unrealistic.\n\nTheir main concern is that the Treasury Department said on Tuesday that lenders will be responsible for preventing fraudulent claims by verifying borrower eligibility, which is determined by a few measures including the borrower\u2019s number of employees and its average monthly payroll costs.\n\nBanks also must take steps to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing, a process that would normally take weeks, the sources said.\n\nBanks are concerned they could face regulatory penalties or legal costs down the line if things go awry in the haste to get money out the door. But at the same time they are worried they will be blamed for not moving funds fast enough if they perform due diligence the way they would under normal circumstances, the sources said.\n\nCommunity banks said the Treasury\u2019s guideline interest rate of 0.5% will be unprofitable, and that many small banks will not have sufficient liquidity to front up the loans.\n\n\u201cTaking all of the above concerns into consideration, many banks have already indicated that they will not be able to use the Program under the current terms,\u201d the Independent Community Bankers of America wrote to the U.S. Treasury and Small Business Administration, which are jointly administering the loans program, on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe strongly recommend that you make changes to the guidelines before the Program goes live so that it will work as intended by Congress,\u201d the group, which represents thousands of small banks across the country, wrote.\n\nThe Treasury and the Small Business Administration did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nAfter hearing the concerns, Treasury officials are considering withdrawing Tuesday\u2019s guidance and are working to fix the issues, according to two sources.\n\nReuters could not learn which specific big banks are thinking about shunning the program. The Bank Policy Institute (BPI), a Washington trade group, hosted a call on Wednesday during which executives from its members discussed their concerns, three of the sources said.\n\n\u201cOur banks are committed to ensuring this program works and that all of the operational complexities and process challenges are worked through so we can achieve Congress\u2019s goal of helping America\u2019s small businesses,\u201d Greg Baer, President and CEO of the BPI, said on Thursday.\n\nMembers of the group include JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) Citigroup Inc (C.N), Truist BankBBTVA.UL and PNC Bank PNCBNK.UL.\n\nBanks want a document customers can sign attesting to their eligibility and other requirements, thereby relieving the industry of responsibility for potential misconduct.\n\nOne source said banks are also seeking a written assurance from the government regarding their legal liabilities and obligations before they agree to participate in the program.", "created_utc": 1585847842.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ftqaxx/thousands_of_us_banks_may_sit_out_smallbusiness/", "is_self": true}
