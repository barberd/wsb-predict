Its stock has been basically ignoring all this beer virus bullshit because entirely American utility companies dont give a shit what other countries are fucking doing. Or, even better, the entire country is staying inside using fucktons of air conditioning all summer because they're too scared to go outside because of Corona. They service one of the spots is gonna hit hardest (Florida) and are basically un-fucking-stoppable. They've gone up 7% in the past week, and 12% in the past 3 months. As this \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b shit spreads. They'll keep going up. The best part? All the fucking tendies we're making from this can be cooked using an oven powered BY Duke Energy's infrastructure.\n\nTl,Dr: $DUK 7/17 $120, 1/15/21 $130. $DUK to the fucking MOON.", "created_utc": 1583465788.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fe7j20/dd_duk_calls_all_the_way/", "is_self": true}
