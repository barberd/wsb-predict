{"id": "gsd5uf", "title": "New Animal Advisors: The Triumvirate", "selftext": " The Random Pet-o-Tronic stock picker extraordinare removes the needs for pesky things like technicals, DD, reports, new, catalysts or any semblance of knowledge of the market or industry.  No we use things we can\u2019t really control to determine what our nest stock play will be.\n\nThe great thing about this is that I am certain that it will perform better than the average stock trading hobbyist, which means it should perform better than 90% of WSB (and perform better than 100% of me).\n\nAll that is required is a stock screener (any will do), something to generate random numbers (search google for \u2018random number\u2019), and the Animal Advisory Staff below (known as the triumvirate).\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/WzOujEN](https://imgur.com/a/WzOujEN)\n\n First thing is to load up the stock screener and select all stocks which meet this criteria:\n\n* Average Volume > 100k\n* Market Cap > $300M\n* EPS > $0.00\n\nUsing the random number generator from google, we pick a stock and then decide out play based on the first animal that makes noise.  I made two trades today, so I need to make two pet-o-tronic plays to see how they do.\n\nThe first stock on the random is $TU.  Phini is the first animal to make noise and she's the bear....but stocks always go up, so we toss this stock.\n\nSecond try stock is $MRO.  Elphie quickly barks at something so that means we need to buy about $100 worth of MRO.\n\nNext one (to replace the first dismissed stock) is: $RDWR.  Elphie has barked again at a leaf, or an orange, or the wall...who knows.  Guess I'm buying some of that.\n\nThe Triumvirate has spoken, I'll let you know how it goes.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/JSSqPuI](https://imgur.com/a/JSSqPuI)", "created_utc": 1590694790.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gsd5uf/new_animal_advisors_the_triumvirate/", "is_self": true}
