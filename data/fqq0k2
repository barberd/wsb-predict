As we are all expecting a very high death toll it is very important to recognize that their stock is severely under priced currently. I have worked in the funeral business in the past and I can assure you profit margins are high.   \nAnyone here who has lost a loved one knows what it's like to be price gouged during such an emotional time. That practice will continue and more importantly, the capability to hold full services will be greatly reduced.  \nWhy are cemeteries surrounded by fences? Because everyone is dying to get in.   \n\n\nNow the part of solid DD.  \nA cheap basic urn will cost you \\~$150 not including the additional mark-ups $2k - $4k total per death.  \nTheir cost to produce is \\~$15.  \n\n\nCremation is the service package most suggested for poor families.  \nWith the massive unemployment it's a gaurantee families can't summon Tens of thousands of dollars in 10 days to have a, \"proper funeral.\"  \nWe will be burning poors in groups of thousands before the summer heats up.   \nFamilies will be BBQing grandma and grandpa instead of sending $10k+ for a full funeral.  \nThus urn sales are going to moon.    \n\n\nRemember : Don't fucking Thriller.", "created_utc": 1585421465.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqq0k2/bury_me_with_my_stonks/", "is_self": true}
