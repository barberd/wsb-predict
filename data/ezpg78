Do not EVER pay a third-party collection agency. They are all scams trying to trick you into paying them. These agencies are the sole reason why so many Americans are in debt and have been in debt for 20+ years. Once you sign with these agencies or give them your personable identifiable information, they've got you. \n\nFor example, let's say you are in debt with Sprint and you haven't been able to pay your phone bill for a few months. You owe Sprint because you have a contract with them, so they are legally allowed to halt your services until you pay. After about 6 months of failing to pay your phone bill, Sprint will likely email you or call you notifying you that your debt will be sent to a collection agency. They will use fear-mongering and intimidating tactics to try to scare you from the \"harm\" that this can do. \n\nNow this is the kicker and 99.9% of Americans do not know this. Once Sprint sells and signs over your debt to a collection agency, you are NO LONGER in debt. You do not owe Sprint anymore because they just sold that money to a third-party agency. You also do not owe the Collection Agency because they have no proof that the debt belonged to you and you did not sign a consent form allowing this agency to charge you. \n\nWhat these agencies do though is they will call you nearly every single day harassing you and trying to scare the living crap out of you to get you to either sign with them or admit that the debt was yours. They will say everything that they possibly can say to scare you, intimidate you, and trap you. These are trained salespeople who are trained to trip you up and make you give them your identifying information. \n\nIf you haven't already given a collection agency your name, address and other personal information, don't do it. If you by chance answer your phone and they ask for your name and address, ask who they are. As soon as they say that they are a collection agency, hang up the phone.  Don't ever give them your information because that's how they have gotten so many people. A Collection Agency cannot take any form of legal action against you if they have no proof that the debt that they bought from the initial lender belonged to you. The lender loaned you at their own risk and the agency bought it at their own risk. \n\nThese agencies are frauds and their job is to trick people into paying them because as soon as you start, they can then legally force you to pay them. You don't ever have to pay debt back. Paying off debt will never improve your credit score dramatically. The only way to do that is to work with a Credit Repair Company. \n\nThe easiest way to avoid these scams is to make a habit of not answering the phone for numbers you don't recognize. These agencies are traps and it will be the worst mistake of your life. In your state, there is usually a statute of limitation of about 5 years. This means that these agencies can legally harass you for a maximum of 5 years. Once that 5 years is up, they cannot try to trick you anymore. Even if you did slip up and tell them who you are, they can't force you to pay because the time limit is up. Collection agencies are the single reason why College Debt, Credit Card Debt, and all other forms of debt are so high in the U.S right now. People are falling for these scam artists and shooting themselves in the foot.\n\nOnce again, don't EVER pay a collection agency. Once they bought your debt from the initial lender, you are no longer in debt!", "created_utc": 1580978040, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ezpg78/fuck_a_collection_agency/", "is_self": true}
