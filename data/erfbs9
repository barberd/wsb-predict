Yes, but the cashflow is only there when there is money, right now money is flowing into Tesla, but investors are going to wake up soon.  Price/Earnings ratio is probably somewhere beyond 100 meaning the current stock price does not reflect the real value of the company (obviously).  People are soon going to realize that papa Musks company is a big troll, since they don't really have anything to offer except a few thousand poor quality e-cars - where other companies are catching up already.  The only thing they can offer is battery tech and the data they collected - but it is not worth as much as ppl think. \n\n**Shorting TSLA a good idea?**\n\nNo, definitely not.  I would even assume; the stock price will still go up based on all the stupid people and papa Musk still supplying capital to the company.  But in the long term it is a strongly overpriced stock (even technicals like the RSI are telling this) and sooner or later it is going to pop.\n\n**Buying TSLA a good idea?**\n\nMaybe, but maybe not.  The recent correction can indicate a trend reversal, or it is just a natural correction and the trend is going to continue.  But not a single technical instrument can tell for sure.   \n My guess would be, that the price is still going to go up, this is also based on a very strong resistance at the 500 line - the sellers have no momentum and were not able to break it when there was one.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nNo one can tell whether the stock is going up, down, sideways or in fu\\*\\*ing circles.  My suggestion is not to trade Tesla in any form and just watch the retards play.", "created_utc": 1579537115, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/erfbs9/tsla_literaly_worst_stock_out_there/", "is_self": true}
