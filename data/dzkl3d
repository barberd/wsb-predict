{"id": "dzkl3d", "title": "ITCI calls January 17th", "selftext": "Yo ITCI might get an approved drug for schizophrenia on December 27th by the latest. Good safety profile and seems to be effective. Lot of OI on 15 dollar calls. The way I see it: this stock will either skyrocket or plummet so your safest bet would be to buy one put at 5 dollar strike and one call at 15. If it gets approved, it\u2019ll go above 20 so you\u2019ll make enough to cover all premiums and then keep some for yourself. If it doesnt get approved, it\u2019ll plummet to 2 dollars and you\u2019ll still make enough to cover the premiums and then take some for yourself.", "created_utc": 1574348899, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dzkl3d/itci_calls_january_17th/", "is_self": true}
