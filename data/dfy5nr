{"id": "dfy5nr", "title": "Most Liquid Options Spreadsheet - Bid Ask Spread", "selftext": "Hey everybody, I'm not sure how much demand there is for something like this, but when I looked online, I could not find a single resource that would measure the bid-ask spread of options for a stock and put the most liquid options in a list for people to use. \n\nI heard about just filtering by the S&amp;P 500 or use stock volume and infer from that, but that left a lot to be desired.\n\nWhat I decided to do instead was create a list myself of all S&amp;P 100 stocks and calculate their bid-ask options spread. Now, this was a tough thing to do without demolishing Google Drive, so I decided to limit my option choice to just ATM Calls for a pre-determined expiration date, and infer based on that single data point how liquid the option contracts are for that specific stock.\n\nBecause Google Drive doesn't allow data whores, I decided to make every stock static EXCEPT AAPL, that way if you wanted, you could copy this sheet into your own personal drive, take the formulas from the AAPL row, and apply them to whatever companies you want.\n\nSheet #2 is just a filter I put together of all stocks that have less than a 10 Cent spread AND stocks that have less than a .10% spread/price ratio.\n\nI know this is a mediocre explanation, and my grammar is trash right now, but it's quite late here (When I wrote this) and I just wanted to knock this out while I was thinking about it. If you have any questions, comment them down below and I'll try to get back to them.\n\nAlso, the  \"Put Mark\" column is irrelevant and from a side project I was doing, feel free to delete that, I just want the formula there in case I ever want to continue working on that project.\n\nLink: [Google Sheet Bid Ask Spread](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v4Vfmndqo4AFQ1ul8jeKzE04CrScJodYcm8E7Hs8Rj8/edit?usp=sharing)", "created_utc": 1570714816, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dfy5nr/most_liquid_options_spreadsheet_bid_ask_spread/", "is_self": true}
