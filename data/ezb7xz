{"id": "ezb7xz", "title": "Tesla Down Today", "selftext": "No shit Tesla is going to go down. Do people really think its more valuable than ford or GM, who know how to make money? I\u2019m going to lay some sad fact on you folks - I own a small business with 60 employees, and last year I made more profit than Tesla. Revenue is worthless if you can\u2019t turn a profit, or at least break even like Amazon used to while growing the business. Tesla has 45,000 employees, its a joke not to break even at their size. I also toured the  CA factory about 5 years back, there was 1 out of every 2 employees asleep on the floor of the factory. No joke, It\u2019s like they got all the other car manufacturers reject workers. If I was Elon I\u2019d cut the workforce in half, its easier for people to do two people\u2019s jobs than cover for known slackers.", "created_utc": 1580916708, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ezb7xz/tesla_down_today/", "is_self": true}
