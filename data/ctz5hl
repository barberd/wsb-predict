{"id": "ctz5hl", "title": "Lululemon Autistic DD for upcoming Earnings", "selftext": "So I guess I\u2019ll do these every so often for my autistic take on lululemon. First of all it is one of the most promoted high end legging brands ever. Huge celebrities promote them and they are slowly becoming a staple. They\u2019ve had recent expansions to Europe and Asia and their popularity is soaring because of Instagram thots and yoga pants porn. Yoga pants porn is up 45% according to pornhub from last years statistics. It\u2019s becoming a very popular porn category. Many fucks wanna buy their girlfriends these yoga pants just so they themselves can experience the same events they have seen in porn. \nBut jokes aside, the company on paper actually looks really good, they not only sell yoga pants but now they have been shifting towards a male market also. With yoga pants costing about $100 USD and with sales numbers this high, it is no wonder this stock has been doing great these last few years. Most retailers have a profit margin of 1.5-6% however lululemon has an incredible 14% profit margin. The reason for this achievement is their cheap cost on manufacturing and shipping. I hope for a 5-10% move upward this earnings hopefully the stock will be around 185 a share just before earnings. Many estimates project a share price of 200+. Its very hard for me to make a bearish case on this stock, perhaps if yoga pants become less popular? But who doesn\u2019t like thick jiggly asses in a tight pair of space grey yoga pants? \nDisclaimer I am NOT LONG $LULU (My gf however is) my dick DOES get long when I see yoga pants. Do your own research before you invest blah blah don\u2019t take my advice blah blah yada yada something something don\u2019t blame me for your loss if I\u2019m wrong blah.", "created_utc": 1566488409, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ctz5hl/lululemon_autistic_dd_for_upcoming_earnings/", "is_self": true}
