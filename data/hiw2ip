Holding your shares for 24-hours and selling them right before market close the next day (Repo Day). This only seems to work with the \"Term\" repos which usually start operating on Tuesday mornings. I put together a chart to show how successful this strategy has been.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ui0xe18914851.png?width=1150&format=png&auto=webp&s=087d6cec2629c82c32fc8a9fd31ee8acab5627ee\n\nTL:DR: On July 7th (the next Term repo day)....
