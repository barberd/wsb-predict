{"id": "gg1be9", "title": "PPP/EIDL stupidity", "selftext": "Long story short. Burner acct as I got non autists who know me on here and I'm a closet retard\n\nOwn 2 businesses, applied and approved for all that covid shit. Had a decent amount saved up for expanding in 2020 but now saying fuck that as the economy would rape me if I expanded into 2 new locations like I was planning. Instead I've decided if I'm going to get fucked I might as well yolo my reserves and use the EIDL/PPP as my new cash reserves. \n\nLets see that retarded advice y'all are gonna give. I need ideas on what to yolo for tendies. Short term only(30 day or less options, futures or stock holds starting from 1june when the loans get disbursed) and none of that safe ITM shit. I need tendie bets.\n\nClarification update:\nUnsure on the amount I'll get. I got the max EIDL advance so it should be a decent amount (at or above my cash reserves)\n\nSINCE ITS CONFUSING SOME: I'M USING MY CURRENT CASH RESERVES THAT WERE SAVED UP FOR EXPANSION NOT THE PPP OR EIDL BOTH OF THOSE WILL BE USED FOR THE BUSINESSES.", "created_utc": 1588970840.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gg1be9/pppeidl_stupidity/", "is_self": true}
