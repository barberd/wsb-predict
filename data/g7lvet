All credit goes to him for discovering this opportunity.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFor those of you who read and followed my DD on Tuesday morning:\n\nI'm sorry for those who bought FLIR calls at the peak of $43 and then paper-handed at a loss later this week. Buy high, sell low. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut to those of you that held this weekend, you will be rewarded bigly for your faith. The MM's bought [one million shares](https://imgur.com/a/QVkWGh6) right at closing today in anticipation of the news that would be breaking over the weekend. \n\n\nhttps://securitytoday.com/Articles/2020/04/24/COVID19-Thermal-Cameras-Start-to-Hit-the-Marketplace.aspx?m=1&Page=3\n\n>Reuters is reporting that FLIR has seen \"exponential increase in demand,\u201d said Frank Pennisi, president of the FLIR industrial business unit. He also said the company is \"having to prioritize hospitals and medical facilities.\u201d FLIR is having difficulty meeting demand, frequently with one to two month backorders for these products.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nhttps://boston.cbslocal.com/2020/04/22/coronavirus-thermal-imaging-cameras-in-demand-fever-detection/\n\n&nbsp;\n\nhttps://abc13.com/coronavirus-texas-covid-19-thermal-technology/6127369/\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nLastly, thermal imaging will be mentioned on 60 minutes, with FLIR's camera being visible in the video. Expect Boomers to be on this stock faster than a Briebart reader is on hydroxychloroquine and a z-pack thinking it's a cure for Corona.  \n\nhttps://twitter.com/60Minutes/status/1253813948803158018?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI know FLIR isn't only player in the game but it is one of the few publicly traded and they also sell a shit-ton sensors to 3rd companies who don't have the resources and patents to build their own.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nCan we also get a big GUH for u/BigBrownBearMarket who entered a [massive short position on FLIR?](https://imgur.com/Aybg04m) Hope the autist sold Friday. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nPositions? On top of u/awildianappears 's mother. https://imgur.com/0huUVmr (Mods pls ban him if you haven't already)\n\n\nBut seriously, don't FOMO into call on Monday as I expect a massive pump and for [the love of GUH](https://imgur.com/Aybg04m) do not buy 5/15 calls unless you think they'll be in the money as IV crush and Theta will kill you after earnings are released. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSpeaking of earnings, Expected EPS had been drastically lowered from last quarter (in Feb not accounting for new demand) and I expect extremely positive guidance moving forward. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n$55c 7/17 calls but don't buy at the pump Monday. For those of you holding calls, look to offload some to cash in on that sweet IV on Monday. I'm pretty bullish on another big pump on earnings unless it has been pumped too much ($46+) before then. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPS: look into $WORK. They have been smashing their previous expected EPS quarter after quarter and I expect this one to be no different. Possibility of record earnings hasn't been priced in but I have seen no big moves by the MM's yet. MSFT Teams is a competitor but I expect a short-term pump for $WORK regardless.", "created_utc": 1587781951.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7lvet/dd_flir_big_news_breaking_this_weekend/", "is_self": true}
