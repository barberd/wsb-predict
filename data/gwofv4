It is an ETF for sports betting which holds fellow meme stocks like DraftKings and Penn. Not to mention this is the first ETF of its kind. It\u2019s also from the same company that started the esports ETF, $NERD, which grew 28% in a year. Keep in mind that is for esports, which literally nobody gives a fuck about. While no options trading is available yet, we can expect that soon. We are all degenerate gamblers so I fuckin suggest you autists get in on BETZ which it\u2019s cheap. Not to mention the fact that the NBA just today announced the season will resume on July 31st. With this happening, I expect all other sports to announce a date in the near future. Once this rona virus passes thru fully all 50 states will legalize sports betting, only adding to the tendies we will make of this shit. I\u2019m fuckin retarded but truly can\u2019t see a way this goes tits up. Okay that\u2019s all I got goodluck", "created_utc": 1591299318.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gwofv4/get_in_on_betz_before_its_too_late/", "is_self": true}
