{"id": "ffz33z", "title": "Lesser Explored Short Ideas", "selftext": "Edit: I am adding good ideas from the comments to this list. So we can have a running list of best ideas.\n\nWWE - Only down 3% today and cancellations are only inevitable. Target is $30.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g1h396liuol41.png?width=1470&format=png&auto=webp&s=d528b7c8967109cb59b1f4b1d7f419286507e5f6\n\nMTCH - Match - Are you going to be dating when you can caronavirus? The chart looks awful. Just broke the double bottom.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hrmrd2zmuol41.png?width=1444&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e75fb6afb366cecf036b127b8fdd1d9c6482ae7\n\nCAKE - Cheesecake Factory - Shitty sit down restaurants like Cheesecake factory get taken out first. Drive through only for me.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lejeqd75vol41.png?width=751&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f7152f0c59837441c8925523cc04351eac8f720\n\nLVS - Las Vegas Sands - Vegas is going to turn into a deadzone soon. Short with options. Plus Sheldon has karma coming to him.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cdonhz0dvol41.png?width=1486&format=png&auto=webp&s=f91a688261ccd36464824a9436904ac808614dc0\n\nCMG - Chipotle - Overpriced burrito maker. Sitdown business will get crushed, deliveries and pickup are a small % of their business.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/02s94dutvol41.png?width=729&format=png&auto=webp&s=9175c053323707c03bce6e352f6cba3a9dcac6c3\n\nMSG - Madison Square Garden - Too much live event exposure. NBA valuations will go down because of lower ticket sales as well. UFC / Fights will get cancelled. Only issue here is they are in the middle of splitting their sports and entertainment businesses. Someone smarter should tell us what this would mean.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wlam27f7xol41.png?width=730&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce2210c3d5084321713072e3ce9330d07e8b9c30\n\nIMAX - Theaters close. Less investment into audio and video equipment. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sou4mmte1pl41.png?width=726&format=png&auto=webp&s=138fda8f722ca60e3c3006f9adccfad44cff3f4f\n\nNDLS - Noodles Company - Recommendation from [**u/fanofpotatoes**](https://www.reddit.com/user/fanofpotatoes/) has not fallen that much. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jnwdzsg62pl41.png?width=718&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d8e113d9facd7b1f9e7100a45c045bcb04d3e3b", "created_utc": 1583777960.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffz33z/lesser_explored_short_ideas/", "is_self": true}
