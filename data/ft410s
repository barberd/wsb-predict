{"id": "ft410s", "title": "September War Rhetoric", "selftext": "Attention on conflicts in news cycles tend to peak around Labor Day. I\u2019m betting on POTUS ramping up rhetoric about conflicts, especially to get away from beerflu headlines. Honestly what POTUS hasn\u2019t used conflicts to command attention?\n\nSo I'm looking at $KTOS XQ-58A Valkyrie, it\u2019s considered \u201clow cost\u201d so it fits with US defense strategy against near-peer threats like China and Russia. US wants low-cost unmanned air craft capable of overwhelming near-peer air defenses by sheer numbers. I can hear it now, the distrust for China over beerflu numbers; but come September the distrust will gravitate around their military.\n\nThere are other options like $LMT and $NOC, congratulations on you\u2019re big dick if that is what you can afford. But I\u2019ve found a position even a cuck like me can enter. Kratos Defense& Security Solutions is winning contracts and producing results in record time. It's my position that this stock will go up as news cycles go into war fever near labor day.\n\nI\u2019ve entered on low volatility, with a tight bid-ask spread, and Greeks in my favor. Now I just have to wait.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kratos-leader-combat-drone-market-190852388.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kratos-leader-combat-drone-market-190852388.html)\n\n[https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/03/1994347/0/en/Kratos-Awarded-4-9-Million-Sole-Source-Contract-Options-for-Drone-Mission-Kits-and-Missile-RF-Subsystems.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/03/1994347/0/en/Kratos-Awarded-4-9-Million-Sole-Source-Contract-Options-for-Drone-Mission-Kits-and-Missile-RF-Subsystems.html)\n\ntl;dr KTOS Nov 20 call $15.00, $17.50\n\nFull disclosure, I am a complete retard.
