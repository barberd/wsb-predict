I fell back asleep cause here in Hawaii RH market opens at 5-5:30am, I had already set an alarm for 7:30am and when i woke up I saw that spy was mooning and for w.e reason noticed there was a halt on trading because it was up to 350$. (No shit this felt real as fuck and i saw the number 350 and was going to sell but it wouldn\u2019t let me so I went back to sleep). Later woke up at 11ish and noticed the actual price. I am not bullshitting when I say I woke up turned off the alarm and saw what I saw and believed it to be true and went back to sleep. So lucid dreaming can be triggered by going to sleep, setting an alarm to wake up 4-5 hrs later then using FILD technique. I have had instances of lucid dreaming before but this was on some next level shit and was not intentional. I clearly saw spy at 350 and saw a news article in my app saying trading was halted. It was real and it happened to me. But I know it was a dream of some sort because obviously it did not moon like that but I truly believed it when I saw it. But you heard it here first , Spy 350", "created_utc": 1583648826, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ff8psr/i_had_a_vision_dd_not_included/", "is_self": true}
