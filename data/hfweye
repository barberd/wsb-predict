After taking my account from 14k to 19k in a week, I am terrified it might just be a fluke. Biggest lessons this week have been the importance of timing and getting in and out of trends quick enough, trying not to get too greedy with a trade and WALKING AWAY (who knew it could be so hard?). I realize that there are a million things I don't know that I don't know. For all you long time traders I would really appreciate advice on what life lessons/trading lessons have helped you improve the most?", "created_utc": 1593126910.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hfweye/holy_grail_advice_for_a_new_trader_what_rules_do/", "is_self": true}
