However,  despite the amount of money I've lost on $TEAM $TSLA $BAC $ROKU $SQ (Hit or miss $BA), $AMZN has never failed. I've been down 50% on calls, and no matter what just iron hands and holding for a couple more days changed to 50% profit. To me 50% profit is a good chunk, even when just buying a couple contracts weekly. So why don't more people buy $AMZN calls. The company for fuck sakes was worth $2000+ at one point and dropped to 1300 from period October. Just think people should be talking about the literal free money $AMZN has been giving to us since December.", "created_utc": 1555987890, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bgb3o9/why_dont_more_people_just_buy_amzn_calls/", "is_self": true}
