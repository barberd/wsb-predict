{"id": "ff6bsc", "title": "Private prisons AKA Beerflu Camp", "selftext": "I got some real shit DD here cus I did it all on my phone watching 28 weeks later and researching the best places to get toilet paper delivered same day since Costco\u2019s out of stock and im retarded autistic blah blah blah whatever fuck you. \n\nAnyway\n\nAccording to some supreme Supreme Court ruling, private prisons have to provide healthcare for their \u201cguests.\u201d The two largest public private prison companies are GEO Group (I hate them) and Core Civic (I hate them too). Now I\u2019m not sure about Geo Group, but according to a wHaRtOn BuSiNeSs ScHoOl study, healthcare related costs are the 2nd largest expenditure for the company (EDIT: Corecivic) behind, you guessed it, staff (not the staph infection).\n\nThere are reports of the beerflu spreading among prisoners in China but there\u2019s not enough data to say definitively what the rates in their prisons are. However, in Korea (there\u2019s only on real Korea) there are reports of nearly ALL patients in a psychiatric (similar in quarters to prisons) ward contracting the virus.\n\nNow it\u2019s seems like Geo Group owns more prisons near the coasts while Core Civic owns more inland and in the Midwest. Would be nice to get some age demographics on populations of each companies \u201cguests\u201d but I haven\u2019t been able to find that really.\n\nBasically once this virus starts to hit prison populations their malnourished guests may legally require a lot of treatment, expensive policies may have to be put in place to reduce spread, and there will inevitably be lawsuits from negligence.\n\nSomeone tell me why I\u2019m a retard and why this is all incorrect before I buy some puts on GEO or CXW 3 or so months out.\n\n\nhttps://publicpolicy.wharton.upenn.edu/live/news/1736-the-current-state-of-public-and-private-prison\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2020-02-22/nearly-all-patients-in-south-korean-psychiatric-ward-have-virus", "created_utc": 1583636178.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ff6bsc/private_prisons_aka_beerflu_camp/", "is_self": true}
