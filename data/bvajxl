Sometimes I discover surfaces I didn't know existed. It takes me a few days and last time, I noticed that my AMD stocks gained 20% (my biggest position then). Felt great. Ended up with a perfectly clean apartment and more cash.\n\nHere we are two years later, and I thought \"hey maybe if I work as hard as the last time, maybe my TSLA position will do well (it's my biggest holding now). I've been at it for three days and I'm pretty satisfied with the result, considering TSLA has been a falling knife lately and the market took a huge shit, TSLA mostly stayed the same and stopped falling the last three days. So, longs, you're welcome.\n\nI'm running out of things to clean though...", "created_utc": 1559324458, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bvajxl/tsla_longs_youre_welcome/", "is_self": true}
