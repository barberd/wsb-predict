{"id": "fq6gst", "title": "The Danger Faced by Uber Drivers Hits Home", "selftext": "This just landed in my email from a tech blog ... and honestly, most of us have known this for weeks at this point (I bought my first UBER / LYFT puts on 2/26), but for any fellow \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b in need of even MORE confirmation bias, you're welcome.\n\n>The risks that many workers\u2014in supermarkets or delivering goods\u2014face from the coronavirus hit home as news broke that a New York City Uber driver died on Wednesday. His family reportedly said he had taken a sick person from Kennedy airport a few weeks ago, before falling ill himself.\n>The death is sure to inflame a bitter argument about whether Uber drivers, like other gig workers, should be treated as employees and therefore qualify for unemployment insurance and maybe health insurance. Washington\u2019s coronavirus aid package temporarily expands unemployment benefits to \u201cgig\u201d workers. But that won\u2019t solve the long-term problem.\n\n**TLDR**\n\nUber dude drove a sick person to the airport, caught the beer virus, and died. Ride sharing is cancelled.\n\n**My dumb positions**\n\n* LYFT $25p 4/17\n* UBER $20p 6/19\n* SPY $210p 6/30\n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c", "created_utc": 1585345242.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fq6gst/the_danger_faced_by_uber_drivers_hits_home/", "is_self": true}
