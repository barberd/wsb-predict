I must say this subreddit has helped with morale and tendies. I wanted to give back for the first time as a result of some of my big gains on GH. \n\nLong time lurker, first time poster. Go easy. TL/DR at the bottom.\n\n**Overview:**\n\nGH uses liquid biopsies. Which means they are able to get a lot of information from DNA in the blood that can give clues about what types of treatment are most likely to work for the patient. Additionally, the procedure is relatively simple and non-invasive compared to traditional biopsies. Their focus in the short-term seems to be around detecting Lung cancer, but will expand. Their stock has seen a large bump due to the positive results from their recent NILE Study ([Source](https://www.biospace.com/article/guardant-s-liquid-biopsy-trial-hits-primary-endpoint-for-lung-cancer/))\n\nThis is huge. The average cost of a lung biopsy was $3,784, with a mean cost of $14,634.  (Average cost of a lung biopsy with complications was $37,745, and adverse events were reported ion 19.3% of patients with biopsies ([Source](https://www.radiologybusiness.com/topics/care-delivery/cost-analysis-reveals-need-reduce-biopsy-use-diagnosis-lung-cancer)). Not only can a biopsy be painful, risky, and time consuming, but there also exspensive! GH tests cost about $6,800 and takes seven days,\n\n**Recent Q4 Performance:**\n\n\\- Sales grew from $20mil to $32.9mil +64%\n\n\\- Net Income from -$15mil to -$25mil\n\n\\- EPS: -$0.07 to -$0.30\n\n([Source](http://investors.guardanthealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/guardant-health-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2018))\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nGH has invested heavily into LUNAR clinical studies. These results, if positive, will help detect early-stage cancer, recurrence of the disease and overcome challenges like biological noise mutations associated with aging and limited sensitivity of genomic-only tests where less tumor DNA to be found ([Source](https://www.biotecnika.org/2019/01/lunar-assay-for-early-cancer-detection-by-guardant-health/)). In addition, if their technology platform works (Guardant360) could capture a large market opportunity ($35bil) for cancer survivors who require periodic monitoring (Lunar-1), and individuals who  at higher risk of developing disease (Lunar-2). These results should be available sometime during the 2nd Half of 2019 and initial pilot data will be available some time next month. \n\nGH is expected to grow revenue over 130mil, 43%, in 2019, but net loss is expected to increase to $130m. Pretty scary, but they have the cash, $500mil. ([Source](http://investors.guardanthealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/guardant-health-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2018))\n\n**Tl/DR:** GH has surged recently do to their favorable results utilizing liquid biopsies. I expect GH to continue to rise when they unveil the final results of the LUNAR assay sometime mid 2019 and their initial findings next month.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, If you liked this. I'm looking for another stock to throw my Combat/Haz pay into. Give me something good and I'll return the favor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "created_utc": 1552694571, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b1m3hl/guardant_health_gh_long/", "is_self": true}
