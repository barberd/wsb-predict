{"id": "gozpmh", "title": "PCOAB Chinese stock compliance", "selftext": "The new bill going to senate says that if the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board can\u2019t review the companies\u2019 audits for three straight years, their securities would be banned from trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq or elsewhere in America. Of course by today, nearly every Chinese stock has faced some level of selloff, some deserving and others simply caught up in it. Having over half of of state controlled ownership is also criteria for delisting.\n\n I want to leave some resources out so you all can check your Chinese holding's compliance. \n \n Tool #1: The [PCOAB](https://pcaobus.org/) index, used to determine if your company has been able to file into the American auditing system in the past.\n\n Tool #2: An old but maybe helpful [list](https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/Chinese%20Companies%20on%20U.S.%20Stock%20Exchanges.pdf?mod=article_inline) that can give you a lead on whether or not your company had 30% state ownership as of February last year. This can give you a lead to some further DD. This list comes with 165 names, but is just a supplement. Along with this, you can google the amount of state ownership a company has, if it is over half the company is now a shorting candidate.\n\n So as a group effort I was trying to get any of you with Chinese holdings to try and run it through, lets see which companies are definitely not compliant and which are. I believe if enough people participate we can find one good shorting candidate and at least one company that has recently become undervalued (shoutout to HUYA) by Monday!", "created_utc": 1590212845.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gozpmh/pcoab_chinese_stock_compliance/", "is_self": true}
