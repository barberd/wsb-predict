{"id": "ctjo8e", "title": "Ugh. Robinhood.", "selftext": "I'll probably get a quicker response here than from customer support but I did send in a ticket already.\n\nI'm a PDT. Have over 25k in my account.... About 30 in cash and equities. Haven't dipped much below that and not under 25 at closing. Last night at 11 PM I got this email:\n\n\nWe wanted to let you know that your Robinhood account has been restricted to position-closing orders only.\u00a0\n\nThis means you can sell any stocks that you own, but you won't be able to make any purchases.\u00a0\n\nThis restriction can occur for a number of reasons, such as:\n\nA negative balance in your Robinhood account\n\nA reversed bank transfer into your Robinhood account\n\nMargin maintenance calls\n\nDay trade violations\n\nSecurity alerts\n\nObviously I don't have a negative balance, the bank transfers I have made in the past went through, and I'm not violating any day trade rules since I'm over 25k.\n\nSo can someone explain how margin may have hurt me? I'm not trading on margin since this isn't a gold account. Also, how long before this ban might be lifted?", "created_utc": 1566406933, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ctjo8e/ugh_robinhood/", "is_self": true}
