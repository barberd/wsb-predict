Then from what I could tell someone from a infected factory flew to the headquarters in the EU and the USA, causing them to shut down and be \"sanitized\". Then today it came out some report says Nike and apple were using Muslim prisoners to make the goods. Last on stupidhood I noticed nike says 70% of it's sales are from outside the usa with a growing portion being from Asia.  I'm no gay bear but I think there is a very high chance the next earning will miss.  They also seem all in on the Olympics that may or may not happen. Can they survive and how low do you think it will go? \n\nTL:DR a auti notices Nike could be the crown turd of the gay bears family jewels ..and just a horible company ethically.
