I've been trading options on RH for a couple years and switched to Fidelity about 6 months ago.  I got approved for options trading referencing my experience on RH.  Aside from buying to open calls and puts I've sold CSP and covered calls.  I'm looking to do more theta gang stuff but it seems like Fidelity doesnt automatically exercise long legs if your shorts are assigned and that I need to have cash available for the short leg.  Could someone please verify this for me?  I've tried to be resourceful and google it but have only found that Fidelity will auto exercise ITM options but nothing about an ITM short and OTM long.  If this is the case, could someone recommend a broker (besides RH), that'll auto exercise the long option for me?  My work keeps me quite busy and while I intend to manage my positions as best as I can, I can be away from my phone or a computer for long periods of time.", "created_utc": 1581306275, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f1kjal/recommend_a_broker_to_auto_close_long_legs/", "is_self": true}
