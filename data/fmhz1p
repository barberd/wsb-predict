The Death of Modern Portfolio Theory, The Loss of Risk Parity, & The Liquidity Crunch**\n\n[SPY 1 Yr\\/1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/vr7nxmwtc1o41.png?width=2032&format=png&auto=webp&s=1238dc8aa8cddc1a801da03beaeb4ff3aa6c0b84)\n\nModern portfolio theory has been based on the foundational idea for the past 3 decades that both equities and bonds are inversely correlated. However, as some people have realized, both stocks and bonds are both increasing in value and decreasing in value at the same time.[\\[1\\]](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/upshot/markets-weird-coronavirus.html) This approach to investing is used pretty much in everyone's 401K, target date retirement plans, or other forms of passive investing. If both bonds and equities are losing value, what will happen to firms implementing these strategies on a more generalized basis known as risk-parity? Firms such as Bridgewater, Bluecrest, and H2O assets have been blowing up. \\[[2](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-14/dalio-s-macro-fund-plunged-about-20-this-year-as-market-tanked),[3](https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2020-03-13/bluecrest-shrinks-from-relative-value-trades-amid-losses-exits)\\]\n\nLiquidity has been drying up in the markets for the past two weeks.[\\[4\\]](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-14/traders-nightmare-liquidity-vanished-when-they-needed-it-most) The liquidity crisis has been in the making since the 2008 financial crisis, after the passage of Dodd-Frank and Basel III. Regulations intended to regulate the financial industry have instead created the one of the largest backstops to Fed intervention as the Fed tried to pump liquidity into the market through repo operations. What is a repo?\n\n>A repo is a secured loan contract that is collateralized by a security. A repo transaction facilitates the sale and future repurchase of the security that serves as collateral between the two parties: (1) the borrower who owns a security and seeks cash and (2) the lender who receives the security as collateral when lending the cash. The cash borrower sells securities to the cash lender with the agreement to repurchase them at the maturity date. Over the course of the transaction, the cash borrower retains the ownership of the security. On the maturity date, the borrower returns the cash with interest to the lender and the collateral is returned from the lender to the borrower.[\\[5\\]](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2018027pap.pdf)\n\nBanks like Bank of New York Mellon and JP Morgan Chase act as a clearing bank to provide this liquidity to other lenders through a triparty agreement.\\[[6](https://www.jpmorgan.com/jpmpdf/1320634324649.pdf)\\] In short, existing regulations make it unfavorable to take on additional repos due to capital reserve requirement ratios, creating a liquidity crunch.\\[[7](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-12/financial-markets-need-temporary-close-like-the-one-after-9-11),[8](https://www.biancoresearch.com/the-moment-in-this-decline-has-arrived-2/),[9](https://www.jpmorgan.com/jpmpdf/1320634324649.pdf)\\] What has the Fed done to address this in light of these facts?\n\n>In light of the shift to an ample reserves regime, the Board has reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero percent effective on March 26, the beginning of the next reserve maintenance period.[\\[10\\]](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200315b.htm)\n\n**II. Signs of Exhaustion & The Upcoming Bounce is a Trap, We Have Far More to Go**\n\nA simple indicator to use is the relative strength index (RSI) that a lot of WSB is familiar with. RSI is not the be all and end all. There's tons of indicators that also are indicating we are at a very oversold point.\n\n[SPY 1 Yr\\/1 Day RSI](https://preview.redd.it/vshsz3wyd1o41.png?width=2086&format=png&auto=webp&s=a122fdedb45c84cc441132aa0d0a7265476c4c22)\n\nGiven selling waves, there are areas of key support and resistance. For reference, I have not changed key lines since my original charts except for the colors. You can check in my previous posts. 247.94 has been critically an area that has been contested many times, as seen in the figure below. For those that bought calls during the witching day, RIP my fellow autists. The rejection of 247.94 and the continued selling below 233.86 signals to me more downside, albeit, it's getting exhausted. Thus, I expect the next area in which we start rallying is 213. \n\n[SPY 10 Day\\/30 min](https://preview.redd.it/rcwrkh7ud1o41.png?width=2032&format=png&auto=webp&s=70952d3b14635c52467515b8ef2f6f6a004a4f4f)\n\nAnother contrarian indicator for buying calls is that notable people in finance have also closed their shorts. These include Jeffery Gundlach, Kevin Muir, and Raoul Pal.\\[[11](https://twitter.com/TruthGundlach/status/1240394134717947905),[12](https://themacrotourist.substack.com/p/governments-are-panicking),[13](https://twitter.com/realvision/status/1240688338912169990)\\] \n\n**III. The Dollar, Gold, and Oil**\n\nAs previously stated, cash is being hoarded by not only primary banks, but central banks around the world. This in turn has created a boom in the dollar's strength, despite limitless injections of cash (if you think 1 trillion of Repo is the ceiling, think again) by the Fed.\n\n[DXY](https://preview.redd.it/477uixirq1o41.png?width=2600&format=png&auto=webp&s=173721c0bd69a6f277493baf0dfc04b59570f7d6)\n\nDespite being in a deflationary environment, the DXY has not achieved such levels since 2003. Given the dollar shortage around the world, it is not inconceivable that we reach levels of around 105-107. For disclosure, I have taken a long position in UUP. However, with all parabolic moves, they end in a large drop. To summarize, the Fed needs to take action on its own currency due to the havoc it's causing globally, and will need to crush the value of the dollar, which will likely coincide with the time that we near 180.\n\nIf we are indeed headed towards 180, then gold will keep selling off. WSB literally screams bloody guhhhhhh when gold sells off. However, gold has been having an amazing run and has broken out of its long term channel. In times of distress and with margin calls, heavy selling of equities selling off of gold in order to raise cash. As previously noted, in this deflationary environment, everything is selling off from stocks, to bonds, to gold. Thus, at this point in time, cash is king. \n\n[\\/GC Futures Contracts 5 Yr\\/1 Wk](https://preview.redd.it/9rp9fgaes1o41.png?width=2054&format=png&auto=webp&s=cbbf359bb80476aca2490bb6f830de17d4f3dfd4)\n\nWhat about oil? Given the fall out of the risk parity structure, I'm no longer using TLT inflows/outflows as an indicator. I've realized that energy **is** the economy. Closely following commodities such as light crude which follow supply and demand more closely have provided a much better leading indicator as to what will happen in equities. Given that, oil will also most likely hit a relief rally. But ultimately, we have seen it reach as low $19/barrel during intraday trading. Oil has far lower to go. \n\n[\\/CL Futures Contracts 1 Yr\\/1 D](https://preview.redd.it/vcafxqons1o41.png?width=2054&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b8f7580afe768b72d41fd3b93d22011d133c220)\n\n**IV. The Next 5 Years**\n\nIn short, the recovery from this deflationary environment will take years to recover from. The trend down will not be without large bumps. We cannot compare this on the scale of the 2008 financial crisis. This is on the order of 1929. Once we hit near 180, the Fed crushes the dollar, we are in a high likelihood of hitting increased inflation, or stagflation. At this point the Fed will be backed into a corner and forced to raise rates. My targets for gold are around 1250-1300. It may possibly go near to 1000. Oil could conceivably go as low as $15-17/barrel, so don't go all in on the recovery bounce. No matter what, the current rise in gold will be a trap. The continued selling in the S&P is a trap, will bounce, forming another trap, before continuing our painful downtrend.\n\nI haven't even mentioned coronavirus and unemployment until now. I've stated previously we are on track to hit around at least 10,000 coronavirus cases by the end of this month. It's looking closer to now 20-30,000. Next month we are looking to at least 100,000 by the end of the April. We might hit 1,000,000 by May or June. \n\n[Comparison of the 2020 Decline to 1929](https://preview.redd.it/12exuhfgs1o41.jpg?width=976&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8d71d68d4834a354bbbd44c937d5e3e8fba9f920)\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**tl;dr We're going to have a major reflexive rally starting around 213, all the way back to at least to 250, and possibly 270. WSB is going to lose their minds holding their puts, and then load up on calls, declaring we've reached a bottom in the stock market. The next move will be put in place for the next leg down to 182, where certain actors will steal all your tendies on the way down. Also Monday might be another circuit breaker.** \n\n**tl;dr of tl;dr Big bounce incoming. Bear trap starting 213. Then bull trap up around 250-270. We're going down to around 182.** \n\n**tl;dr of tl;dr of tl;dr WSB will be screwed both left and right before they can say guh.** \n\nHint: If you want to get a Bloomberg article for free, hit esc repeatedly before the popup appears.
