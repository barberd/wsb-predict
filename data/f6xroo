{"id": "f6xroo", "title": "Dropbox - 2/20/2020 AMC - Pretty Dangerous", "selftext": " \n\nStock: **Dropbox**\n\nDirection: **Neutral**, Monster Bullish\n\n**Price Target:** **18$, 22$**\n\n**Type: Put Credit Spread, Call Debit spread**\n\n**Fundamental:** As one of the old unicorns of silicon valley, Dropbox is in a bad place due to its lack of product moat in an increasingly competitive industry. However, DBX does sport one of the lowest PE ratios within the sector, leading to some value buyers eyeing the stock. DBX is somewhere in the muddy waters between Growth and Fundamental, and this can lead to some outsized price action.\n\n**Technical**: Priced above in 20, 50 day moving averages, below 200 day MA.  MACD shows neutral convergence. RSI shows around 55, slightly above neutral. Options sentiments are bearish in volume and neutral open interest. Implied movement of about 12.3% or 2.27$.\n\n**Sentimental**: Dropbox recently released its new product end of last quarter. This new product aims to smooth over some of Dropbox\u2019s lagging technology and services. While a revenue re-acceleration was started last quarter, the increased cost on marketing, sales, and transition may affect earnings perception. Dropbox has a history of beating earnings; it also has a history of sliding after earnings. **This one is quite risky, and a bullish call is considered contrarian**. \n\n**ROI: 28%, 300%**\n\n**Risk Level: 5 out of 5, 50/50**  \n**I suggest the put credit spread. This overall play is much more risky, but also a very interesting case of growth vs fundamentals.**  \n\n[https://imgur.com/0BHsZem](https://imgur.com/0BHsZem) \\- put credit spread  \n [https://imgur.com/a/jViR0pz](https://imgur.com/a/jViR0pz)  \\- call debit spread\n\nIt's probably better to watch.
