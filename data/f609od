This shit just flies for an hour to the earth's edge, you pop a low gravity boner, and come back down.\n\nThat's it.\n\nThese analysts dont even know what the company does. \n\nThey compare this turd to fucking SpaceX??\n\nLmfao. \"In the business of space travel.\" Dont invest long term into this shit. Especially considering tickets are 250k a pop, and SpaceXs Starlink is gonna severely undercut them.\n\nLiterally the stock is fueld by retail investors that think this shit company actually goes to space.", "created_utc": 1582065549, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f609od/spce_is_not_spacex/", "is_self": true}
