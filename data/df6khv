IMO, News/Media are not even 60% correct as they just follow market producing sensational topic for that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor example, my guess is tomorrow market will be up and news/media will assign Powell Balance sheet as reason.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn short: Market goes UP or DOWN on its own, but media assigns some attractive  reasons to it.", "created_utc": 1570569941, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/df6khv/stock_market_vs_media_news_who_is_first_and_who/", "is_self": true}
