{"id": "hau57q", "title": "Is XOG the new HTZ", "selftext": "So I was looking through Financial Times and an interesting article on XOG came up.\n\nBasically they skip out on an interest payment on bonds and then file for Chapter 11. Overall their business seems like the biggest impact was driven by COVID and ensuing drop in demand, impacted also by the oil price war and just couldn't hang on long enough.\n\nInteresting point to me is that it looks like they're not closing the place and selling off the assets to pay their creditors. It looks like they're just transferring ownership of the company to the creditors and keeping the company trading.\n\nI can't imagine their creditors would be willing to be bought off using stocks in a company that they thought was worthless, so looks to me like there could be a turnaround on the horizon for XOG.", "created_utc": 1592410032.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hau57q/is_xog_the_new_htz/", "is_self": true}
