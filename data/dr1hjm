They have invested huge amounts into the tech platform (BAMTech) to enable this kind of service. They have one of the strongest brand names in media and entertainment as well that they are the leading content provider on the planet. Their studio productions will be able to serve two fold as blockbuster hits and then down the road adding to their streaming service. It only makes sense for them to dominate the growing DTC media/entertainment market.\n\nHowever, the DTC market is becoming saturated with strong competitors including: Amazon Prime Video, Roku, Netflix, and now the entrants of Disney+ and the recently announced AppleTV+. We see this competition as a double-edged sword in the sense that there is the potential to grab revenues and market-share with the willingness of big companies to take some of the pie (powerful companies want to enter this market because it makes sense to), but also that more elite entrants into this already cut-throat industry is no easy task. What will separate one company from the rest will be their ability to provide quality content, which Disney has positioned themselves to do.\n\nWe believe that Disney will be sensitive to outside economic pressures that might affect their cash flow. Revenues from the Media Networks segment (and largest portion of revenues) of their business has been on the decline over recent years, but has been off-set by higher revenues from Parks and Resorts and Studio Entertainment. Should any of their other segments come short of providing support, their cash flow will take a hit.\n\nThe introduction of Disney+ will barely make a dent in their net revenues over the next 4-5 years. Potential growth and valuation will be highly dependent on subscriber count, but with Disney\u0092s current state of the brand and franchises they have put themselves in a great position to compete with their largest competitor, Netflix. With quality content coming from each of their studios (Marvel, Pixar, StarWars, and National Geographic, to name a few) they will have a strong line-up going into this launch.\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\nDisney is entering a highly competitive market, but we believe they have the right tools to succeed.\n\n**1.** They\u0092ve already successfully tested out the tech to launch DTC services (BAMTech - 4.9B in expenditures by FY 2020).  \n**2.** Their already successful content outlets will provide a great value to their service.  \n**3.** Competition, such as Netflix and AppleTV+, will be spending billions on content without a proven track-record. This is a risk for them and not so much for Disney since Disney already has a great pipeline of many quality IP.  \n**4.** In terms of pricing, we see many similarities between all DTC content providers and the key factor that will separate one company from the other will be in content, which we believe Disney will provide and excel at.  \n**5.** Disney\u0092s stock price has already jumped over 30% from the initial announcement of Disney+, but we think this new range will serve as a benchmark and good support.  \n**6.** Disney isn\u0092t expected to report blowout subscriber count on the launch of their service, but we foresee they have the possibility to do so.  \n\n\n**Positive Outlook Model:**  \n\\*Current revenue segments continue to grow at 18% Y.O.Y (quality studio releases, leveraging of brands to park themes, etc).  \n\\*Disney reports fantastic initial subscriber count for Disney+.  \n\\*Disney reports ESPN+ growing in-line with expectations.  \n\n\n**Neutral Outlook Model:**  \n\\*Current revenue segments continue to grow at 18% Y.O.Y.  \n\\*Disney reports mediocre numbers for initial subscriber count to Disney+ (as they are expected and will be viewed as a neutral event).  \n\n\n**Negative Outlook Model:**  \n\\*Market is affected by recession, Disney sensitivity to economic pressures.  \n\\*Growth slowing at media networks.  \n\\*Growth slowing at parks and resorts.  \n\\*Very low numbers for initial subscriber count to Disney+.", "created_utc": 1572793175, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dr1hjm/full_disney_due_diligence_report_inside_what/", "is_self": true}
