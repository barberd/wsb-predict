And we're going to ignore the rising China tensions. It seems like the only risk that bulls will acknowledge is if the virus surges again. So. How are we not looking at the very likely outcome of a surge in coronavirus cases from the nationwide protests? A completely unforeseen risk a couple weeks ago that could drastically change the dynamic of the curve.\n\nAlso, you can say civil unrest doesnt hurt the market but are these protests not showing that trumps time is about up? Ive seen the market rally on hopes of his reelection, but no reaction to him losing the faith of the nation? And I swear if I see another headline saying \"the market eyes reopening\" im going to lose my mind. We've priced in the reopening like a million times at this point. It is not news. The virus risk from the protests, that is news.", "created_utc": 1591158782.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gvn21a/why_is_the_market_ignoring_the_huge_virus_risk/", "is_self": true}
