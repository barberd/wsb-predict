{"id": "eztjql", "title": "PTON Fiscal 2Q20 Earnings Call Summary", "selftext": "Every metric was good (especially churn at only 0.74%!) EXCEPT for revenue guidance for next quarter, which was $470-480m in revenue vs. high end expectations of $507m. Apparently their delivery logistics shaved off a couple days vs. last year, pulling forward 6,000 deliveries, or about 5% of revenue from 3Q20 into this current quarter. If they HADN'T improved their delivery times, revenue guidance would have been in line with expectations. Oh well. I suspect that the stock will go down this week and rebound into next week, as it did after last quarter's earnings release, going from $25 to $22 for a week, followed by the run-up to $37 as people realize the company is raising guidance for subs, revenue, and EBITDA. Just my $0.02. I still own $50 March 20th calls and I'm not selling at the moment. It'll take a few days for the sellers to clear out so expect a few down days. My notes from the call are below. \n\nFiscal 2Q20 Metrics\n\nConnected Fitness Subs came in at 712k, up 96% y/y and beating high end expectations of 703k\n\nRevenue was $466m, up 77% y/y and beat high expectations of $443m\n\nEngagement was strong with 12.6 avg monthly workouts per connected sub, up from 9.7 y/y\n\nAvg churn of 0.74% was way below expectations of 1.00%\n\nEBITDA of ($28.4m) was well ahead of estimates of ($55m)\n\nGross margin flat at 42.3% y/y\n\nHas $1.5b of cash\n\nCash from operations was $33.2m\n\nCapex was $48.8m due to buildout of new studios in NYC and London. Also purchased Tonic, their Taiwanese supplier for $46m\n\nFiscal 3Q20 Guidance\n\n843-848k ending connected fitness subs, in line with estimates of 847k\n\n$470-480m in revenue, up 50% y/y, but below estimates of $507m\n\n($25-35m) EBITDA loss, in line with estimates of ($30m)\n\nChurn below 0.95%, below estimates of 1.10%\n\nGross margin 43-44%\n\nFull year guidance for FY2020-\n\nRaised ending connected subs to 920-930k, essentially in-line with estimates of 921k\n\n$1.53-1.55bn in revenue, up 68% y/y and in line with estimates of $1.54b\n\nGross margin of 43.5-44.5%\n\nAdj EBITDA of ($95-115m), much better than ($140m) expected\n\nChurn below 0.95%, better than 1.04% expected\n\nNotes from the call\n\n\\-Churn was positively impacted by lower return rates and higher retention than expected\n\n\\-30% of classes taken were non cycling classes\n\n\\-Goal is to have more accessible products that can be sold to all demographics (cheaper products coming?)\n\n\\-Digital subscription is lead generation tool for selling more hardware. Makes sense why they dropped the price of the digital subscription. Running digital app at breakeven. \n\n\\-Germany going as well as the UK launch did in 2018.\n\n\\-Return rates still in the low single digits.\n\n\\-Better delivery logistics means time from order to delivery was shortened by a few days, causing a pull forward of revenue from 3Q20 into this quarter. Hence the huge outperformance this qtr and guidance below expectations. The shift was 6,000 deliveries, or about 5% of revenue. \n\n\\-They have new software updates that will help to gamify working out and create more of a social network around the leaderboard. \n\n\\-no pressures yet from cheaper competition. People love the Peloton product, not just an exercise bike\n\n\\-Still early days in US, UK, Germany, and Canada. Focused on those markets before expanding to others.\n\n\\-Heading towards profitability earlier than we thought (2023). We view profitability as a managed outcome. We are prioritizing growth right now because we have low churn and we want as many subscribers as possible. Lots of leverage in G&amp;A and Marketing.", "created_utc": 1581001364, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eztjql/pton_fiscal_2q20_earnings_call_summary/", "is_self": true}
