{"id": "fghbf1", "title": "Why GM is Fucked", "selftext": "GM is absolutely FUCKED, here's why:  \n\n\n**Reason #1: Loss of market share to foreign competition**  \nChina is the world's largest auto market, and GM is one of it's larger auto producers. Sales in China for Ford and GM are already being lost to domestic Chinese companies. Check this article from Jan:  [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/07/gm-warns-of-ongoing-challenges-in-china-as-sales-fall-15percent-in-2019.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/07/gm-warns-of-ongoing-challenges-in-china-as-sales-fall-15percent-in-2019.html)   \n\n\n**Reason #2: Coronavirus in China and the US**  \nCoronavirus has TANKED auto sales in China (over 80%). People aren't going out, people aren't buying cars. Unless you're getting a car from a Carvana machine, you're probably at a dealership shaking hands, which no one wants to do right now. China sales drop, which we can expect to see mirrored in the US as the virus spreads.   \n [https://www.pymnts.com/news/international/2020/vehicle-sales-down-80-pct-in-china-due-to-coronavirus/](https://www.pymnts.com/news/international/2020/vehicle-sales-down-80-pct-in-china-due-to-coronavirus/)   \n\n\nManufacturing facilities are also slowed in China, and likely to be slowed in the US. This is not a job that can be done working from home, and the manufacturing process will suffer if people cannot go out to work in factories.  \n\n\n**Reason #3: Looming Recession**  \nWith the possibility off a recession on the horizon, this is especially important to consider. Auto Manufacturing gets absolutely pummeled in recessions. Cars are simply not a luxury people can afford in troubling financial times. Also, GM has recently invested a TON of money trying to prove that it can compete in the EV market. If a downturn happens now, this could obliterate its chances of competing anytime in the near future.  \n\n\nTake a look at the charts here from McKinsey on how auto manufacturing is susceptible and was hit in 2008:  [https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/resilience-in-transport-and-logistics](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/resilience-in-transport-and-logistics)   \n\n\nPositions:  [https://imgur.com/a/VRGj38e](https://imgur.com/a/VRGj38e) but I'm definitely buying more puts  \n\n\nTL:DR - Puts on GM and probably Ford too", "created_utc": 1583860659.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fghbf1/why_gm_is_fucked/", "is_self": true}
