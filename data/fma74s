As I type this from my fucking igloo, I thought i'd share three Canadian stocks for you everyone to consider adding to their portfolio if you catch the knife in our bear market \n\n1. **BAM.A** - **Brookfield Asset Management**\n\n* Current price: 55.88 CAD/38.65 USD\n* 52 week High: 90.72 CAD/68.41 USD\n\n* Why you fuck?\n\nBrookfield Asset Management and its three subsidiary companies (Brookfield Renewable Partners, Brookfield Infrastructure and Brookfield Business Partners) have assets in all kinds of different sectors around the world from bridges to shopping malls to residential/commercial units and skyscrapers. This is probably one of the most solid Canadian companies I can think of. Management is smart and made some smart plays over the years that paid off as you can tell by its fucking graph. **It also trades on the NYSE**\n\n* Link about their global presence: https://www.brookfield.com/about-us/global-presence\n\n2. **AC - Air Canada**\n\n* Current Price: 12.41 CAD\n* 52 Week High: 52.71 CAD\n\n* Why you fuck?\n\nFirst things first, I hate this company. This company is one of the reasons why we pay so much for flying with an article to support this comment\n\nhttps://www.macleans.ca/economy/business/why-its-getting-more-expensive-for-canadians-to-fly/\n\nBut thats the thing! With the shit service and the strip down bullshit flights like Air Canada Rouge they have a monopoly over Canadian airspace. They only have one domestic airline competitor being WestJet but when it comes to international flights, Air Canada is the airline king if you want places like Europe, Asia and Australia. They have a lot of control over prices and unlike you Americans with Air Alaska, Delta, United Airways and American Airlines.....Air Canada will be here for a very long time and will continue to fuck our ass and pockets for a huge bounce in the near future **Trades on OTCMKTS as ticker ACDVF**\n\n3. **BMO - Bank of Montreal**\n\n* Current Price: 62.00 CAD\n* 52 Week High: 106.5 CAD\n* Dividend: 6.81% quarterly \n\n\n* Why you fuck?\n\nTo be honest, I don't bank with this bank and I can think of better banks like TD and Royal Bank but when compared to the other 5 banks....it got absolutely destroyed in the sell off which I think is a little unfair. They're the best value in terms of P/E and P/B plus with the stock losing almost half of its value... you can potentially get an easy double tendies in a bounce long term wise while you burn your money at SPY calls during these times. They have one of the best dividend payouts out of any Canadian stock and Canadian banks are some of the best financial systems in the world. Old article:\n\nhttp://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GlobalCompetitivenessReport_2010-11.pdf\n\nAs you can see picking any of the bank stocks is honestly not stunned but if you want to see more tendies which is what we all want then buying BMO could potentially serve you the most. **It also trades on NYSE**\n\n**TL;DR** Stunned Canadian suggesting buy and hold stocks from the TSX", "created_utc": 1584769273.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fma74s/shitty_tsx_top_3_canadian_stocks_to_buy_and_hold/", "is_self": true}
