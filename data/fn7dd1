{"id": "fn7dd1", "title": "Zombie companies", "selftext": "Hey autists,\n\nI've been thinking about what happened in Japan in the 90s, and it seems like we're going to follow in their footsteps and possibly end up with a bunch of [zombie companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_company) in the US thanks to all the free money Uncle Sam will be handing out left and right. This will be made worse if the Fed starts buying US stocks through ETFs, which will make the numbers go up and keep these dead companies going forever (which is what the Bank of Japan has been doing).\n\nWhat I'm trying to figure out, however, is how to get tendies from this. Is this just the next level manifestation of modern monetary theory? Do stonks really only go up (except when they go down)? Is my pp small? If everyone knows stonks only go up, won't everything be priced in, thus not leaving any room for profit above inflation? Was the new WSB logo designed by Hitler himself?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: [positions, you fucks](https://i.imgur.com/JN4zRH0.png)", "created_utc": 1584911665.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fn7dd1/zombie_companies/", "is_self": true}
