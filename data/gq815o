Every serious stock market player (LIKE JPOW FOR EXAMPLE) looked at eachother, and when asked the question \"do you want to lose all your money and I'll lose all of mine?\", answered \"you know what NO, how about EVERYONE just KEEPS the money, since MONEY ISNT AN ACTUAL THING BACKED BY GOLD, AND WE CAN DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT IT TANKS\". Like lmao, every weekend there's thousands of doomsday posts and comments here that are proven wrong again and again because OBVIOUSLY, when people are given the choice of everyone going bankrupt or not, they choose not. GET WITH IT, RETARDS. THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN CRACKED.
