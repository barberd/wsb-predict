Revenue has been beat by an average of 1.91% in Quarter 1 earnings in the last 4 years. The years that had the highest next day movements were the years that had the largest revenue beat. I believe the revenue in this upcoming earnings report will surprise everyone. Amazon, in the past month, has hired an additional 175,000 employees to keep up with the demand. In 2019, Amazon had 798,000 employees. Amazon increased their employee count by 21.9% in one month. There is a direct correlation between revenue and number of employees. The revenue per employee for Amazon in 2018 was $359,671 or $89,917.8 per quarter ([https://www.statista.com/statistics/217489/revenue-per-employee-of-selected-tech-companies/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/217489/revenue-per-employee-of-selected-tech-companies/)). Another source lists it as an additional $75,000 in quarterly net online sales per new hire ([https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amazons-175000-worker-hiring-spree-suggests-strong-first-quarter-sales-despite-covid-19-analysts-say-2020-04-27](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amazons-175000-worker-hiring-spree-suggests-strong-first-quarter-sales-despite-covid-19-analysts-say-2020-04-27)). This is suggesting an additional $13.125 billion in the Quarter 1 revenue. This is not even mentioning if AWS surprises. \n\nIf revenue surprises analysts, Amazon will see $2500 this Friday.
