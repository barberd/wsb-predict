{"id": "hac9i7", "title": "The Kang Gang Option Strats Guide", "selftext": "Kangaroo market continues on, and I'm here to explain why you should be strangling (or straddling) this market like a trucker strangles truck stop hookers.\n\nFor those who aren't familiar with the two techniques here it is briefly:\n\nStraddles involve buying ATM Puts and Calls at same expiry. (EX: CAR is at 28$, you buy a 28$ P and 28$ C 6/26)\n\nStrangles involve buying slightly OTM Puts and Calls at same expiry. (EX:  CAR is at 28$, you buy a 29$ C and 27$ P)\n\nBut really here we wanna use something called a ''Gut'' Strangle and buy two ITM Puts and Calls at same expiry. (EX: CAR is at 28$, you buy a 26$ C and a 30$ P)\n\nBoth of these strategies help capture the kangaroo to make some delicious roo' tendies by abusing the completely degenerate swings we get day to day. The premiums are high but they don't really reflect the volatility on some stocks to their full extent because instead of flying in one direction we've been bouncing up and down and it hurts the value of both puts and calls. So you can often either be in the green after just 1 day or basically get a ''free option''\n\nCasino and Cruiseline stocks are perfect candidates for this because of their crazy overnight movements, but you can pretty much use any degenerate stock for this.\n\nEX: RN you can get an MGM straddle at 19.50$ with 6/26 expiry for 2.60$ each leg being roughly 1.30$. Which is pretty crazy since the SMALLEST overnight movement for MGM has been 75C in the last 2 weeks and has at least a dollar of movement every day since which has pretty good odds of covering the cost of your spread just with the variation as the moment it moves 1$  the profits start slowly kicking in. At that moment you can sell your spread for a profit as the option going OTM doesn't lose value as quickly as the option going ITM gains. If you get big movement and one option covers the whole spread even better; you can now decide to either play it safe and keep your gainz or keep the other option hoping it goes BOING\n\nBut Straddles are not the ideal solution. If you got cash and volatility is on your side you wanna get some gut strangles and here's why:\n\nAs I mentioned before going ITM often accelerates faster than going OTM, mostly thanks to faggy D buyers and this is amplified by buying ITM options. The further away you are from TM the bigger your delta gets and the closer you get to TM, your delta gets smaller.\n\nHere's an example with the same MGM stock at 19.50$\n\nSo you buy a 22.50$ P 26/6 and a 16.50$ C 26/6 which would cost you about 6.20$ which means you pay only 20$ in ''volatility''.  As your options move around one will capture pretty much even $ while the other will start to get inflated with the value of the volatility.  The closer you get to one of your strikes the bigger the effect will be.\n\nLet's say it goes down to 16.50$. A put 6$ ITM is worth 6.20, it pretty much just gains 1.00 of Delta.But an ATM Call didn't lose 3$, it's still worth 1.25$ which is basically pure profit. Or you can be a degenerate, cover your spread and hope it boings back the other way for a full 1200$.\n\nNow getting to your strike is IDEAL but just getting movement is always positive for you. Say moving 1.50$ will net you about 1.30/1.40$ one way but only lose you 40/50C on the other, that's still good for 80$.\n\nAnyway that's it for Kang Gang strats. Go out there and get the boing generating $$$.\n\nAlso positions:\n\nCCL 17.50C/23.50P 6/26NCLH 18C/24P 6/26ERI 38C/44P 6/26", "created_utc": 1592340055.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hac9i7/the_kang_gang_option_strats_guide/", "is_self": true}
