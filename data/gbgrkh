They stated temporarily closing this week to 'clean'. Now 15% have tested positive. The plant workers are scared to go back. It is scary since in the surrounding counties, Dakota County (Dakota City and South Sioux) has 700 covid-19 cases and Sioux City has 742. Tyson can be traced to 46% of those cases.\n\nThe Waterloo plant closed from having 43% being traced back to Tyson. The Dakota City plant is more than double its size. I hope it doesn't close indefinitely, but it surely isn't looking good.", "created_utc": 1588334281.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gbgrkh/tsn_669_tested_positive_in_dakota_city_plant/", "is_self": true}
