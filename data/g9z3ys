So my question is am I crazy for investing in DHT and EURN while NAT and others are flying? Lol\n\nThis is the ever changing charter rate right now\n\n[https://compassmar.com/reports/Compass%20Maritime%20Weekly%20Market%20Report.pdf](https://compassmar.com/reports/Compass%20Maritime%20Weekly%20Market%20Report.pdf)\n\nThis is how much it costs to run these boats at break even.\n\n[https://www.euronav.com/media/65056/160325-investor-relations-presentation-march-2016.pdf](https://www.euronav.com/media/65056/160325-investor-relations-presentation-march-2016.pdf)\n\nIf you just look at how much they are charging per day for VLCC which is around $150-300k and VLCC break even price is at $27k.\n\nSuezmax break even price is $25k (Couldn't find per day rate for Suezmax because these terms are sometimes very confusing so it's hard to look for)\n\nSo if you just calculate per day price of a VLCC then subtract the $27k for cost to run they are profiting quite a bit of money per day right now.\n\nIN CONCLUSION FUCKING DHT AND EURN TO THE MOOOOOOOOON!!! or not who the hell knows with this market right now.\n\n**0 Comments** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDHT $15c 07/17/20 \n\nEURN $20c 08/21/20", "created_utc": 1588119625.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9z3ys/why_everyone_got_a_hard_on_for_nat_right_now/", "is_self": true}
