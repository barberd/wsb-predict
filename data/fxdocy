{"id": "fxdocy", "title": "German banks are screwed. Germany is faking financial strength.", "selftext": "\"We have the financial strength to overcome this crisis,\" ~ German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz\n\nI\u2019m sorry Olaf, but you just don\u2019t. It\u2019s all fake. Take a look at the finances of Germany\u2019s top two banks Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank. DB is doing so badly that they almost sold it off to its smaller \u201ccompetitor\u201d Commerzbank. In 2019 before all of these shutdowns they were doing so badly that the deal fell through and both business could not make a profit. BEFORE!\n\nNow with the economy in Europe shutting down, who are the two biggest lenders to these failing small businesses? DB and Commerzbank. They keep giving out money to Germans that they themselves don\u2019t have. It\u2019s all backed by the European Central Bank, by all the other member nations. (Not the UK anymore).\n\nCommerzbank is going to take the brunt of the small business loan defaults since that\u2019s where most of its loans are at. But DB is shady AF. They have been fined countless times. For manipulating the gold market to smuggling out Russian money. They failed the US stress test multiple times and the current conditions are worse than the test ever expected. Who knows what other secret trades they are making that will come to light when they end up worthless?\n\nIs Europe going to bail them out? Of course they will! But it\u2019s not going to happen without a fight from all the other member nations. Where\u2019s the German financial strength going to go when all the free money goes away?\n\nTL/DR: Beer virus is killing small businesses. Big German banks fucked. Germany fucked.\n\nEdit: it\u2019s been pointed out that a German finance minister committed suicide a week ago. Thomas Schaefer was most likely worried about the economic fallout about to hit Germany.
