I can hear consistent thuds from above, it seems my wife and her boyfriend are still going at it. I carefully try to sit up, while preventing the bottles from falling off my tiny twin bed, but it\u2019s no use, I\u2019m too hung over. I guh my 4/17 puts all over the floor while the bottles shatter, 99% loss. It\u2019s ok, still within my personal vomit tolerance... uh oh, the after shock hits. I guh my 5/1 puts on the floor as well, 80% loss. I check robinhood and wsb, my main source of news. Record unemployment and horrible earnings, stonks going up. Sigh, I need to buy more puts, I climb upstairs towards the master bedroom, the walls creak and shake as voices echo down the hallway. But something\u2019s different... he sounds different, older. I open the door and it\u2019s not my wife\u2019s boyfriend, not at all. My eyes widen in horror as I see JPow plowing my wife. She\u2019s wearing a sign that reads \u201cyour bank account.\u201d All the while JPow keeps screaming BRRR BRRR louder and louder. I run downstairs screaming and crouch in a corner. I cover my ears and rock back and forth crying in fetal position. Please make it stop, I can still hear that horrible sound BRRRR BRRRRR BRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!", "created_utc": 1586878086.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g17l8e/i_woke_up_this_morning_to_a_strange_sound/", "is_self": true}
