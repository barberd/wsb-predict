I keep on thinking that somehow if I keep reading I will learn how to make some money. But the more I read, the more stupid I feel. Generally, when shit makes me feel stupid I gradually migrate away from it, kind of like my paint huffing days in 8th grade... But I just keep reading this dumb shit. With the time I have wasted on WSB I could have easily read 2-3 500 page books on financial analysis. I'm just gonna say fuck it, and by it I really mean my cross eyed cousin, if she gets preg ill go long on EROS, if not ill find a penny stock going for 4 cents and short it with all i have.", "created_utc": 1570644504, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dfkwin/what_the_fuck_is_wrong_with_wsb/", "is_self": true}
