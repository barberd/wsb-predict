{"id": "gnl6tm", "title": "$CRWD your next tech earnings play", "selftext": "Alright listen up pecker heads I got some glorious DD for all you retards out there. So pull out your tic-tac dicks and start stroking gently as you'll be fully erect by the time you finish reading this, hell it may get you to cum like its a Lisa Ann POV.\n\nCrowdStrike ($CRWD) is a cybersecurity company that sells its software to large corporations, government clients, major banks, healthcare and energy companies. Some of its customers include Goldman Sachs, Amazon Web Servers, MIT, and a shitload of other institutions and corporations. They also have an international presence selling their software in Germany, Australia, UK, India, and Romania. In short, their software protects files saved in the cloud, so all of Jeff Bezos dick pics are safe thanks to them.\n\nWith the expansion of companies adapting to a WFH format, the need for security of all this information going through the cloud is in high demand. The demand for CRWD's software must be skyrocketing just like every other tech company. There is no supply chain issue with this product either so need to fret like other tech companies having supply chain issues as they rely on 10 year olds working in sweat shops in Chi-na. \n\nEarnings come out in 13 day (June 2 for you special ones) and its expected that they will have benefitted greatly from corona. Their price finished the day at $80.97 and have steadily increased from their March lows of $31.95 without missing a beat like most tech companies seemingly to be unaffected by how the SPY has done since the initial gaping dip. It has an ATH of $101.88 so these aren't uncharted waters for this stock. IV isn't gushingly high, around 75%, especially compared to other tech companies approaching earnings so the time to act is ASAP bc I believe it will be well over %100 by next week. \n\nTried to keep this short and sweet bc I know most of you only have a 3rd grade reading level and probably just scrolled to the bottom to see just how retarded I am.\n\n**$CRWD 85c 6/5**\n\nIf its deep (I like it deep) ITM a day before earnings plan on selling EOD, if not then I'll fucking gamble like the degenerate I am on their earnings pumping their price like I do with my penis before bed every night. Hope at least one of you jabronies got off to this so I can feel accomplished for once, good luck and may the pump be with you.", "created_utc": 1590015929.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gnl6tm/crwd_your_next_tech_earnings_play/", "is_self": true}
