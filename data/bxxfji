The only options are stable funds, bonds, large caps, Medium/small caps and international. \n\nI\u2019m pissed that I can\u2019t invest in specific things like healthcare and oil; I think those are better longterm plays than the portfolios that have the usual Apple, Microsoft, etc\n\nIn April I put almost everything in bonds and stable funds. I missed the 5% drop and bought back in last week. Therefore I\u2019m up around 18% YTD. \n\nOne of the funds in small market cap, TASVX, is down 25% since last September. I have no idea what\u2019s in the portfolio, but ETrade gives it a 3 star rating. Good enough for me. I just YOLO\u2019d 70% of my 401K into it.
