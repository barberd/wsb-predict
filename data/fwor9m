{"id": "fwor9m", "title": "We are two,three weeks behind Italy", "selftext": "Just go take a look at the Corona virus chart on worldmeter or whatever it\u2019s called. Italy\u2019s case numbers peaked after a month and we\u2019re just two weeks in. The largest daily case number at Italy was around 6-7k and the highest death toll was about 900. We\u2019re hitting 30k cases a day and case numbers haven\u2019t even peaked yet. There will be 3\u201310k deaths a day in the upcoming weeks here in the US, and we we still don\u2019t even have a complete lockdown. Just to make it clear, we are no where near the peak. I was just driving by and there were still retards hosting a small farmers market. People are hanging out like it\u2019s gonna go away. Jesus, Boris Johnson is in the fucking ICU and could possibly pass away. THE PRIME fucking MINISTER of UK!! 401k inflows are stopped at many companies now and that means even less liquidity to the market. Don\u2019t forget that emerging markets will be devastated. How the fuck are people in third world countries gonna eradicate this virus. If this isn\u2019t bio-warfare idk what is.\n\nTl:dr It\u2019s going to be an absolute hell on Earth in a few weeks. If you already bought puts, hold onto that shit. If you\u2019re entering a position now, short the market on leverage so you don\u2019t have to fight theta or get 2021 puts.", "created_utc": 1586280894.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fwor9m/we_are_twothree_weeks_behind_italy/", "is_self": true}
