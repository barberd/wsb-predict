{"id": "gftfp3", "title": "CYBR Cyberark - Remote cybersecurity company with earnings 5/13", "selftext": "CYBR\n\nCyberark is one of the companies announcing earnings next week. They are a priveleged access management security software company, and their stock is way off their all time highs because they had predicted a big drop in profits before COVID hit. But since COVID hit they've put out new software that allows for secure remote work access without needing high performance hardware VPNs. If you look at other companies offering secure remote working solutions they've easily creamed their original earnings projections. Fortinet is a VPN hardware provider and their stock went up 30% after earnings because companies have been buying remote VPN hardware like crazy. If you look at CYBR stock it's been skyrocketing into earnings the last week.\n\nOnly real downside to this play is that there isn't a ton of options volume, the only calls with any real volume are all gambles on the 5/15 earnings. But CYBR previously guided very low and original expectations were for decreased income, so it's one of the stocks where I could easily see a big beat on earnings. Might also just be worth holding until earnings since almost all the cybersecurity firms have been pumping hard into earnings after the big beats.\n\nPositions: CYBER 5/15 $120C", "created_utc": 1588945259.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gftfp3/cybr_cyberark_remote_cybersecurity_company_with/", "is_self": true}
