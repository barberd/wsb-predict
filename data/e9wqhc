Was late to the train on AAPL for oversleeping and took calls expiring tomorrow near the peak. Was in the green but didn\u2019t sell even when 272.5 wasn\u2019t breaking. Held it  all the way down to tanking my account. But I wasn\u2019t going to let that hold me back. I actually played smart and took AAPL puts less than 30 minutes after that disaster also expiring tomorrow. Awesome choice. Within 20 minutes I was out of the trade locking in my tendies for bringing my account all the way back and to be up 5% on the day. From there it was straight to sleep because finals suck.", "created_utc": 1576199262, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e9wqhc/when_you_lose_25_of_your_account_then_gain_it_all/", "is_self": true}
