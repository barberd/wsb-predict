So I am exercising the game plan that I came in with when this journey started. Find a good entry point and buy Leaps.\n\nI don't have a crystal ball so I don't know how further down this market is going to go but all signs are pointing to Monday being a bloodbath. Assuming the red dildos are coming, I am planning on pulling the trigger on Sept/Oct on the following.... ARKK, BA, SBUX, SPY, ULTA....maybe SQ (overvalued?)\n\nAnyone else considering Leaps? What entry point are you eyeballing and which stocks?", "created_utc": 1592720975.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hd244w/assuming_monday_is_a_bloodbath_it_is_time_for/", "is_self": true}
