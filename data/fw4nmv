I\u2019m your host and resident autist u/expander2. You have to be able to read to gain anything from this so that rules out about half of you. As always, this is organized from most important at the top to least important at the bottom. A TLDR, plays, and previous DD summaries will be at the bottom. My last posts still stand and hold some good info so check it out for more plays if this isn't enough for you greedy fucks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDISCLAIMER; I am not personally advocating for any play that I add to this list. I merely go through a couple of days of posts and find what I think is competent DD. PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry I missed last week it was a wild one and I was pissed about the market in general. I have been watching this shit for a while. Here is what I think. No one here has any idea what the market is gonna do. No one anywhere has any idea! Remember when the market was gonna be red for the next 4 months? Bullshit. Just don't take everything you see on here as the fucking Bible because even the Bible is full of completely made up shit. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCongrats to Mr. Fuzzy Blankeet who is becoming a household name here on WSB. He has inspired multiple people to investigate companies in hopes of exposing their possible demise to the benefit of the rest of us. Honor and tendies await us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn to the DD I suppose. Today we are gonna start with oil. I have been seeing [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fux17s/buy_tanker_stocks_if_you_like_tendies/) after [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/furwfh/oil_to_crash_again/) describing opinions on where oil is gonna go an why. Short term; who the fuck knows. Long term; IT IS GONNA GO UP. Get this into your heads. The market is going to go up at some point. Options are for swings. They are for gambling. Buy some straight shares so you don't ruin yourself, please. DHT Holdings (DHT), Scorpio Tankers (STNG), Tsakos Energy (TNP), Frontline Ltd. (FRO) will probably all go up long term. However, because the Soviets and the Arabs are having a custody battle you need to watch for the entire industry going under. Shale in the US has trouble making any money when the price goes under $70 a barrel. Its a lot fucking lower than that. Shale and fracking companies in the US are going to go under. Chevron (CVX), Pioneer Resources (PXD), and Cimarex Energy (XEC) are all companies to watch. A fall is likely especially because the product is expensive. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext, we have Lakeland Industries (LAKE). Another medical PPE company that is set to make money from the pandemic. They made good money during Ebola and will make good money during this. Earnings for the quarter ended January 31 are out April 15th. They are upping production, opening more factories, and already had ties with the US and the UK before this happened. Read [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fulufx/potential_ppe_play_lakeland_industries_lake/) for a little more info about why its gonna go up. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe medical industry, in general, is going to go up from all the government spending.  Someone put together a list of a lot of medical companies that we can invest in or do options on. The [list is here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fu9nc2/medical_companies_in_the_sp_500/) and can be a lot of help for people that are looking for plays. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe fed hates China, I hate China, I hope everyone hates China. I won't get into why but know that we do not like them. The fed wants to stop Huawei from using our tech in their shit. Huawei is already like a damn tech/spy branch of the Chinese government. This means that the US does not want our tech in their products because we do not want their shit to be effective. To combat this the government is deciding whether or not they should make it so that anything with US origin can not be sold to Huawei. Companies affiliated with Huawei will take a major hit from this, most notably NeoPhotonics (NPTN) who derives more than 45% of their total profits from Huawei themselves. American companies affiliated with Huawei will see a drop in profits if the decision goes through. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally, I have out knowledge of the day which is [how to do taxes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fgfr97/taxes_how_to_treat_those_sweet_tendie_gains/) so the IRS doesn't bust down your door, shoot your dog, and have their way with your ass and wallet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck fuckers and tune in on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for more WSB DD Summaries!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Do a little of your own research, oil goes up long term but down short term, watch for the collapse of the US shale industry, medical companies will show a profit, the feds hate China and Huawei.\n\nPlays; Shares of DHT, STNG, TNP, FRO. Puts in CVX, PXD, XEC. Calls in LAKE and other medical production companies. Puts in companies associated with Huawei like NPTN.\n\nPrevious WSB DD Summaries;[ 3/24-3/25](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fp0s8l/wsb_dd_summary_324325_plays_and_tldr_included/),[ 3/26-3/27](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fq231l/wsb_dd_summary_326327_plays_and_tldr_included/),[ 3/28-3/30](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fruu30/i_compiled_dd_from_the_last_few_days_for_you/)", "created_utc": 1586199602.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fw4nmv/wsb_dd_summary_4346_i_hope_you_fucks_can_read/", "is_self": true}
