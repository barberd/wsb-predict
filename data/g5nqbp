{"id": "g5nqbp", "title": "10 Year Treasury Yield Breaks", "selftext": "10 year yield plunged to .571% today.  For those who don't already know - yields move inverse to price.  Lower yields mean higher bond prices.  There is also an inverse correlation most of the time with equities.  When bond prices go up then stock indices go down.\n\nI will start with the ACTUAL BOND CHARTS (for the autists here who will inevitably ask for the ticker symbol NO you cannot buy this on an equities platform).  Then below I will include the BOND ETF CHART (which the autists here CAN buy on a stock exchange).\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i025zdtch8u41.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4dd8fc18a436f708fd490e0970ff0c896abe906\n\n[Technical signal triggerd on point and figure indicating a downward trend in yield.  This is BULLISH for bonds. and BEARISH for equities \\(except Nasdaq for some reason but go figure\\).  If you don't understand this then go back to my introduction comments. ](https://preview.redd.it/227jwn98h8u41.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=63f6136d9774397d850b6a18e89c3ebd146c8796)\n\n[IEF is VERY close to its mid March highs --just a point or 2 away from hitting it.  Now bonds are generally seen as the SMART MONEY b\\/c their volume overshadows equities by multiples.  ALSO bond traders are seeing the trouble before it hits equities.  I  won't do TA for this ETF and am only using it to illustrate a point.  It is a derivative of the actual CBOE traded bond which I already covered above. ](https://preview.redd.it/nj8mr5z5i8u41.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=29b32e3bd16b4f09e8bbeefea3ef52113150d262)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  Couple of ways to play this:  \n\nA) Buy TNX futures - I don't advocate doing this b/c probably 1% of this board will know how to do so and now is a bad time to get started.\n\nB) Buy TNX options on futures - see above\n\nC) Buy IEF calls - Just no.  theta will screw you.  the price movements are miniscule compared to the adrenaline rush of watching TSLA or something equally nauseau inducing.\n\nD) Buy TLT calls - It has promise but has options movements ALMOST as slow as IEF. So no.\n\nE)  Buy DIA/SPY puts - now we are talking or hold them if you are already long.  \\*If you want to get extra spicy buy QQQ puts for reasons described below.  \n\nTLDR: Use bond charts in conjunction with the ES, SPY, and DIA to look for potential turning points and market color.  Fibs on SPY and DIA for entry and exit points.  Right now bonds are saying equities will get a pounding sometime soon (again Nasdaq seems divorced from reality right now b/c it is tech earning season but if the volatility gets high enough you WILL see forced liquidation of tech stocks - already inching slowly in ETSY and EBAY which have seen big runups weeks before earnings).  When ppl get a margin call they usually sell the most fat positions to raise cash fast and that means tech.  \n\nOh as for my own positions: UDOW May 40p, June 29p.", "created_utc": 1587503244.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5nqbp/10_year_treasury_yield_breaks/", "is_self": true}
