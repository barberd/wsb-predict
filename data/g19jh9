{"id": "g19jh9", "title": "SPY All-Time-High: The Triple Inverse Batman", "selftext": "I'll get right to the point. Last Thursday, in my feverish research, I came across unmistakable evidence of SPY smashing through the previous all-time-high.\n\nWe're all familiar with the Batman pattern, of course. Seen [here](https://i.imgur.com/BaNwQxm.jpg) in mid-March. SPY bounced, and then dropped, exactly as the Batman pattern predicts.\n\nNow, in early April, we experienced the rare [Double Batman](https://i.imgur.com/X5wA8C5.jpg). The Double Batman would accelerate the drop to $180. Like the rest of you, as soon as I saw this, I loaded up on puts. Positions were mostly SPY $230P 6/30.\n\nHere's where we make history. Last week, thanks to the grace and majesty of JPOW himself, we saw the hitherto unheard of [Triple Inverse Batman](https://i.imgur.com/cG5b3e4.jpg)!\n\nI've closed all my SPY puts. When we see a slight bounce, I'll be entering a position long in SPY calls and VXX puts.\n\nMy brain tells me infections and deaths are skyrocketing worldwide, the economy is shut down, unemployment is at all-time-highs, and we're going to be experiencing intermittent lockdowns for the next 6-12 months until a vaccine is developed and approved. My heart tells me to buy puts. None of it matters. The rules have changed. This DD means as much as anything else. I love Big Brother JPOW.\n\nTL;DR Triple Inverse Batman = SPY $420 4/20", "created_utc": 1586884332.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g19jh9/spy_alltimehigh_the_triple_inverse_batman/", "is_self": true}
