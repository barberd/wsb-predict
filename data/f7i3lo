{"id": "f7i3lo", "title": "Thoughts on Ally Financial $ALLY", "selftext": "Keeping in mind the obvious:\n\n1) the market was down today\n\n2) there are mixed thoughts on their recent acquisition of a subprime consumers credit card company\n\n3) Ally is down 12% this week on no bad news\n\nKeeping in mind the autistic:\n\n1) ALLY is an online bank and has lower costs than traditional consumer banks which allows them to offer higher interest rates on checking accounts... Who wouldn\u2019t put a couple bucks in?\n\n2) ALLY\u2019s management seems to believe that the acquisition is a more efficient and less costly way to expand into credit cards, leveraging its attractive deposit and customer base.\n\n3) ALLY can now offer a vital banking product (credit cards) to its already large and growing customer base. Poor people, rich people, college people, autistic people, and even you degenerates use credit cards.\n\n4) ALLY is short for Allison or Alice. Alice in Wonderland is a movie about some chick who basically takes a bunch of psychedelics. Psychedelics expand the mind. If you want to expand the mind you gotta go down the rabbit hole. Going down the rabbit hole takes risk. This past week was a Phat ass rabbit hole for ALLY. How far will she expand next week?\n\nDisclosure: I hold 9x $33 3/20 calls, 1 $30 3/20 call, and 1 $35 3/20 call", "created_utc": 1582320832, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7i3lo/thoughts_on_ally_financial_ally/", "is_self": true}
