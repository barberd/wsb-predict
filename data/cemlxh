Help me", "selftext": "Okay so I spent a week going through regulations, incorporating an LLC, a Limited Partner, writing an operating agreement, PPM, buying a website domain, etc.\n\nEverything is ready to go except a business bank account and brokerage account. I spent hours trying to get through Interactive Broker\u2019s UI to get this message:\n\n\u201cTo be approved to trade, your Total Net Assets must exceed USD 100,000.00\u201d\n\nMind you, my net assets are around $4k, maybe less. I\u2019ve gone to multiple banks who have all turned me down as well. I can\u2019t buy options or open a margin account until I\u2019m 21 because brokers have rules (which are understandable). \n\nIs it just me, or does the entire financial system feel paternalistic? Like pattern day trading and investing in startups are too risky for poor people, yet we\u2019re allowed to buy lottery tickets, because that isn\u2019t risky at all.\n\nAnyways, does anyone know a service that I could use as my broker that lets my buy, short sell, and buy and sell calls and puts? Robinhood isn\u2019t the best because their system is pretty restrictive and you have to pay for Robinhood Gold.\n\nSorry for the rant.", "created_utc": 1563417263, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cemlxh/im_a_poor_18_year_old_who_legally_set_up_a_hedge/", "is_self": true}
