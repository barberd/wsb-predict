There is risk, however, that the lock-up period extending, though I believe this is small due to the diverse investor base.\nI expect the price to be in the $9 to $11 range by Q1 2020\n\nInstitutional investors more optimistic on PTON:\nBaird\u2019s  price target of $28 reps +20% upside potential for shares and stands a $1 below the consensus sell-side PT\n\nDA Davidson initiating coverage at neutral \n\n\n\nComps: \nTown Sports Int\u2019l: 1.8x EV/Rev\nEscalade inc: 0.9x EV/Rev\nNautilus trades 0.2x EV/Rev\nThe Gym Group plc 4.6x EV/Rev\nPlanet Fitness 9.7x(!) EV/Rev\n\nPeloton: 7.9x EV/REV\nassuming 40% expansion of current revenue base (generous imo) \u2013 5.6x\n\nQualitative points:\n\n\t-Hardware married to subscription sales \u2013 -$719.2 revenue came from equipment sales \u2013 only $181.1 from subscriptions. Peloton\u2019s implied argument that their value is more in line with tech/subscription based businesses clashes with the fact that a) most of their revenue is derived from equipment sales (higher COGS), the subscription growth is intuitively and generally speaking inseparable from their hardware b) they have relatively higher cost of sales and customer acquisition than media and tech cos and c) people are cognizant of \"lol wework\" \n\t-Low barriers to entry \u2013 Peloton is already suing a competitor, Echelon fitness, and NordicTrack offers a similar product; will Peloton\u2019s offering be worth the price tag and far and away better than competitors\u2019 to the point that consumers will be willing to allocate a steep portion of their growingly fat and competitive subscription budget towards it?\n\t-Churn implied with growth \u2013 Do you still own the iPhone 3? What about your car from ten years ago? Hardware replacement is largely driven by increased productivity, or consumer driven desire to \u201ckeep up with the jones\u2019s\u201d. Given that fitness equipment offers diminishing marginal returns for the former (excluding conjecture of PTON\u2019s expansion into other products; the difficulties of cross-selling into which will remain unstated), is the latter enough to drive further growth in the future? Peloton generally targets upper to middle class markets. This market slice is shrinking and competitive (Equinox). When that first Peloton bike becomes outdated, Peloton is in direct competition with thousands of alternatives \u2013 this lack of \u201crenewal\u201d churn is something I personally believe will be devastating to Peloton in the next five years, but this is out of the scope of this current thesis\n\t-Low retention mechanisms \u2013 Related to the previous point, is the regret of dropping $2000 on a bike enough incentive to keep you riding it, and committing disposable income to a subscription? There are thousands of way to gain entertainment/remain fit. \n\nPeloton is generously valued on (surprise) optimistic revenue forecasts, which I have doubts towards due to a) low retention mechanisms b) low barriers to entry, c) lack of obvious avenues to transfer and expand their existing subscription base into other products d) fervent competition in the subscription based market\n\nHeavy dilution and sell action is also anticipated at the end of the 180 day overhang, which will be compounded by volatility post earnings news March 2020.\n\nPeloton\u2019s debt load is good and so is their operating profile once they reduce their S&amp;M efforts, but they are currently overvalued based on revenue growth trajectory in my humble opinion. If their revenue growth slows, not are they going to scale back their S&amp;M? Unlikely. \n\nAdditionally, due to Peloton\u2019s dual share system and asymmetry of voting rights/control, Class A holders are in jeopardy of value diminishment through unmanageable amounts of debt / bad management and decisions harmful to equity holders.\n\nHope yall enjoy. Would welcome any ball breaking/points of critique. I realize many people have already written about this stock. \n\nThanks", "created_utc": 1570740920, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dg4egd/dd_on_pton/", "is_self": true}
