I have one and frequently use it by swiping my wife's credit cards including my own credit cards into my bank account to avoid overdraft fees.  Their fees are \"okay\". With legalization of marijuana (or your local drug dealers), avoiding cash advances fees on your shitty credit cards (you know those stupid ass checks they send you with your statement letting you borrow money then charge you like 10%+, yeah fuck that shit), cryptocurrency debit/credit cards *BAM!* right to your bank, avoid those silly exchanges you have to pay taxes on.  Then if and when you get a tax document from square (I never did) just supply your CC numbers explain you actually lost money.. shit maybe you can even write the fees off on your taxes as a loss with your capped $3k losses in stock.  During a recession. Fuckin gold mine.\n\nSO MANY USES FOR SO MANY LOOPHOLES", "created_utc": 1569975643, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dc2i5w/long_sq_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
