Large scale indicators and the debt cycle.", "selftext": "Previous post: \n\n [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6dw3s/something\\_something\\_tea\\_leaves\\_did\\_you\\_see\\_that/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6dw3s/something_something_tea_leaves_did_you_see_that/) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, today was fun. Predictable, but fun! Lets start with what we got wrong, so that cynics feel vindicated: \n\nThe stonks did not go down. (but they did go red, -.01 or -100, a win is a win!)\n\nNow, while we didn't say that they were guaranteed to go down (because we don't make guarantees) , we were feeling like it was more likely than up. Luckily for us, our general conservative outlook put us in a great place to be slightly off today. This is EXACTLY why you hedge for a bit of caution by the way, so you can afford to be (safely) wrong. That said, we did specifically caution against false 'start' signals, which yesterday felt like to me. Today, that proved to be invaluable. Look at all those posts from people saying \"I lost money either way\", \"it was all over the place\", \"this market makes no sense\". Well, it did to us, if you were following along so far. I likened it to the kid that was about to jump off the cliff into the water, but has 2nd thoughts at the end and teeter-tottered. A shove certainly sends us downward, but I'm not sure what that shove might be. Instead, I think our most likely case will be a bit of fidgeting, before jumping anyways. \n\nWe should continue to be READY for the jump, straddles continue to be a great play and you should have cashed on some good straddle today. I did not, because I was lazy and didn't get up early enough before work to get some in today. Oh well. \n\nWe should not, however, bank on the fall being tomorrow. Truth be told, I expect the post market to to maybe recover a token amount  of our losses from today, not counting any strange gaps.\n\nLets take a moment and talk about why indicators often work, so we can agree on what we want to get out of them. \n\nThe universe is a giant ball of millions of patterns forming tons of bullshit. This is such an abstract statement, that it almost seems useless. But it gives us a foundation. We know that water is H2O, right? A simple pattern that repeats itself constantly in the universe. One thing that Fundamentalists in the market like to decry is that Technical patterns aren't guarantees, and you'll be the one to lose big. That's true, and that's exactly where risk management comes in, our 'this is not the droid you're looking for' mechanic.  \n\nBut diicembr! You said Tea leaves were garbage! You're a flip-flopping piece-of-shit karma-farmer! What I specifically said is that the farther away from smaller time frames you get, the less likely a  indicator is to work for any small move. Easy example? Try using the 5 year moving average to trade the 1-minute chart. Now try making 1 trade per year using 15-second chart. You have to give the indicators proper space to work. \n\nNow for a shitty language trick: Fundamentals ARE technical analysis. There is no such thing as trading purely \"fundamentals\". TA's are just math formulas, right? Well Fundamentals is just plugging numbers into those formulas. A + B = C gets a lot easier when you know what A and B equal, which is really just the research that \"fundamentalists\" use to differentiate themselves. They're basically TA'ing the TA. Well, the same concept can be fundamentally applied to using multiple indicators. Today we're going to use a large scale chart (months, circa 2008) to look at the 2008 recession and define what those candles actually mean. You'll notice a lot of similar steps happen in the fall there. Are those fundamentals? Or are there a few patterns forming in there? Or both?\n\n [https://i.imgur.com/kRftdgv.png](https://i.imgur.com/kRftdgv.png) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, I'm going to overlay some indicators on there. I like the Cycle Channel Oscillator, Bollinger Bands, and ATR (2.5atr) trailing stoploss. Why do I like these? \n\n[https://i.imgur.com/Dwzps96.png](https://i.imgur.com/Dwzps96.png)\n\nCycle Channel Oscillator\n\nThis oscillator will tell you when you've strayed too far out of a cycle, and tells you when you owe debts. By creating 4 zones you can see this illustrated: \n\n1. Excessive spending, ballooning debt. Entirely unsustainable, recession of spending incoming. You'll owe time in zone 3 at a 2-1 ratio typically. \n2. High spending, fast moving economy, debt-incurring. If debt isn't payed down, you'll go to zone 1.   \n3. Low spending, smaller creation of debt. If spending is reduced too far, go to zone 4. If spending increases, creating more debt, but increasing the speed of the economy, go to zone 2. \n4. Debt servicing is too high and creates excess capital, pulling you into zone 2. Going from zone 4 to zone 3 historically creates things like the industrial revolution, the renaissance(s), etc. \n\nOne way to look at it, is that zones 1 and 3, 2 and 4, and 2 and 3 are linked in pairs. Too much time in any zone will cause a shift to the appropriate zone after a travel period. Using the zone oscillator, we can see that prior to the burst, the housing market was clearly building more debt, and ended up deep in zone 1. After the unsustainable level fell away, we proceeded pretty cleanly down to Zone 2, had too much debt to sustain and fell to zone 3. A couple attempts to satisfy that debt level were unsuccessful, and we fell to zone 4. We spent about a year recovering to neutral (between zones 2/3). We also note we were in zone 4 for about 1/2 the time we were in zone 1. This 2/1 pattern repeats itself frequently. Ever been told you should get about 8 hours of sleep? 16 awake/8 asleep. Capital..Debt... Hrm. Does this sound like bullshit? Sure. Should we ignore it? No, we should be skeptical and use more indicators to check for correlation. \n\nBollinger Bands\n\nBollinger bands are very similar to the cycle channel, but they also show volatility with the widening channels. Something to keep in mind, is that just because the market is volatile, doesn't mean it will actually move out of alignment at end of the day/cycle. Today was a great example, all that movement and we went -.01c. Bollinger bands are great for realizing when you're in a climbing 'high' cycle, versus a climbing 'low' cycle. Why is that useful? A climbling 'low' cycle is called a mean-reversion, or a 'dead cat bounce'. It doesn't leave the 'dead cat' moniker until it crosses that center line. Is it possible that your dead-cat will convert to be a straight vertical \"v shaped recovery\" climb? Absolutely, but it is as likely? Nope. \n\nThe ATR Trailing stoploss. \n\nIgnore the Buy/Sell names for a moment, and imagine they say \"Bull/Bear Market\". You will frequently be off with this chart by 2.5 times the ATR, but by using this value, it helps lessen the number of \"false starts\" the new markets have. This in general tells you when you need to stop holding a long or short and reverse your position. If you look at our picture, it tells us that there was a flip-flopping of the markets in 2008 as the fed kept throwing spaghetti at the wall to see what stuck. Ultimately, it didn't keep the market from falling, but we did see that we were told to switch to the bear market stance about 3 months after we started climbing. Why 3 months? That is our \"2.5 ATR\" value. We know it won't nail the bottoms or tops perfectly, but we're a lot more concerned with jumping into the wrong market. A smaller value (from 2.5) will work better in choppy environments, but will also require more direct intervention from you to manage, and you'll need thick skin for the increase in flip flops. After all, was today a Bull market? Or a Bear? This indicator will tell you bear, since it ended negative. Without context, this one can drop you out early or late. Combined with bands and cycles, it gives you a great idea of when the trend you're in is ending. \n\nNow lets look at a bigger timeline. \n\n[https://i.imgur.com/obURwzi.png](https://i.imgur.com/obURwzi.png)\n\nWe can see that pretty much from 2010.5-Feb 2020 we're operating in a zone 2 phase with 2 zone 1 jumps. We know (per our thesis) this whole time we've been building debt. We also know that no one ever payed the debt for those two Zone 1 jumps in 2013/5 and 2017/18. We also know that some other investors noted that some investors (like Buffet) have been saying that the market was over inflated and nothing was 'a good buy'. We've been building our economy on aggressive debt for 10 years, and thus the rapid expansion and 'wealth vehicle' creation has boomed. Your Grant Cardones and the like have used aggressively low interest rates to over-leverage their empires on the promises that they'll pay the debt down later. Well, look at that timeline. Look at those red bars in 2020. They're huge. They dwarf the 2008 numbers. If I were using just this indicator, I'd think we were about to enter a big ass debt paydown period. If we don't, if we somehow skip the zone 4 timeout like we did the last 2 times, I can only imagine the next time will be even more catastrophic. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nUsing  ATR stoploss, you night notice that little blip in 2018.5. \n\n [https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/21/investing/oil-prices-trump-saudi-arabia/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/21/investing/oil-prices-trump-saudi-arabia/index.html) \n\nWe see that Oil prices crashing all by themselves can bring about a recession. Now, given it was a single point of failure, the recovery was reasonably quick, even if the effect was deep. We've got failures in the economy, oil, food is starting to be worthless to farmers and scarce to consumers.\n\nHere is the 1929 crash, with the same chart indicators: \n\n [https://i.imgur.com/tqW5eNR.png](https://i.imgur.com/tqW5eNR.png) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNotice how long they spend in zone 3/4 on the backside of the crash, after that giant zone 1/2 climb. Bollinger bands show the same. I find that by comparing indicators to known values in the crash of 08, and looking at current events, and comparing the indicators of the 3 charts, you can get some pretty similar chart/expectations. There is a definite lifecycle of the debt model, and I think we're just starting the down leg to ours. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat does that mean going foward? Straddles for safety, and stoploss puts when I'm feeling strongly we might have started. Also, leaning into positions if things seem good. What does this mean? Doubling down on shares mid-way through a bar. Start the pattern at 1 contract, breaks your target, double to 2, keeps moving, double to 4, 8, etc, till you're at your max comfort. What I don't do, is unload the same way. Take every cut when the ATR stoploss says the market has shifted. If i'm wrong, I'm still richer, even if money is on the table. If I'm right, I'm still richer. Notice both paths lead to being richer. And If I'm wrong early? I'm safe on minimal invested risk. Live to ride another day, and remember, this is a 2 way ride. You want to have money at the bottom to invest in the climb. It'll be slower, but you could be set for life, if you can manage your way down without breaking your (bank) neck.
