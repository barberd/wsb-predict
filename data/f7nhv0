I currently have a 2M dollar position in their warrants (Company issued Calls).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](g2aw3ab5jei41 \"My Positions spread over 4 accounts\")\n\nHere is some DD:\n\nThe company anticipates 2019 revenue to come in \\~425M, an approximate 50% increase as compared to last year.\n\n2018 and 2019 were excellent operational improvement years from an operational standpoint. Gross margins increased to 45% in Q3 and revenue broke 117M in Q3.\n\nJoe Megibow has hinted at a few key items this year. Machine 6,7,8,9 are anticipated to come online this year. Manufacturing capacity will essentially double by year end. Each machine is capable of delivering 90-110M of Net revenue.\n\nCurrently purple is in 1600 wholesale brick and mortar locations. Purple anticipates to continue rolling out to stores heavily. Currently purple is in \\~800 Mattress firms with further expected roll outs and further roll out to regional players. Mattress firm has about 2500 stores as of 2020. There are about 30,000 furniture stores nation wide. Purple is also in Macy's, Denver Mattress, bloomingdales, HOM furniture, Mathison Brothers and Steinhafels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](979yweg8iei41 \"Stores as of November 2019 from PRPL S-3 filed in Nov 2019\")\n\nThe average selling price of mattress has increased dramatically over the last year and their average selling price per mattress is more than 2x Casper's.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](dn1ga50hiei41 \"Purple's S-3 Selling price information\")\n\nPurple's CEO recently commented on their expansion and indicated the only thing preventing them from growing was their manufacturing capacity.\n\n [https://www.nasdaq.com/videos/silicon-slopes%3A-joe-megibow-ceo-purple](https://www.nasdaq.com/videos/silicon-slopes%3A-joe-megibow-ceo-purple) \n\nWatch the above video from about 4:30M and you will see the machine capacity comments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPurple is expected to post their full year revenue and 2020 guidance no later than mid March. I expect that the warrants will likely increase to somewhere around 4.00 from their current price of 2.61.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI expect full year guidance to be somewhere in the 650-700M dollar range and I expect that their adjusted EBITDA will be somewhere around 70-100M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI expect that the stock will jump by 20-30% within a week or two of releasing guidance.\n\nTL:DR: PRPL and PRPLW are a solid play. The stock has mostly fallen under the radar due to a reverse merger through a special acquisition company. Buy PRPL if you want safe Tendies, Buy PRPLW if you're an autist. Warrants don't expire till 2023 and the strike is 11.50. The warrants are dilutive. Comments about manufacturing capacity lead me to believe guidance will be excellent and stock should go up 20-30% if they announce what I expect.\n\nThis is not a pump and Dump, PRPL is a legit manufacturer with excellent growth potential and awesome marketing.", "created_utc": 1582345430, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7nhv0/2m_dollar_yolo_and_some_dd_for_your_convenience/", "is_self": true}
