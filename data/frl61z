That said, cV is starting to infect rural America now.\n\nSo, I think a lot of the Trump bulls will start to realize how serious the situation really is. And, any progress on the vaccine front will be welcome news.\n\nEither way, vaccine or not, I don\u2019t believe the world will ever be the same. cV has changed the world forever.\n\nVirologists have said a vaccine is at least 12-18 months away, but world governments are fast tracking any trials. So, I think they can shave 3-6 months off of initial estimates. So, we\u2019re looking at 6-12 months for a vaccine.\n\nApparently, there are eight strains of the virus. So, would that vaccine cover all 8 strains? And, would it be 100% effective?\n\nThen, what about production of the vaccine? Do we have enough resources to make it quickly enough? I recall that in recent years there were shortages of flu shot.\n\nBy that time, I think world economies will be permanently damaged.\n\nCase in point, can Disney survive without any theme park, cruise, and theater revenue for 6-12 months? Same with airlines, hotel chains, restaurants, professional sports, and tourism-based businesses.\n\nI suspect world governments will have to heavily subsidize their domestic industries. And, the companies that thrive are the ones that can succeed in this new reality. So, any companies that aren\u2019t reliant on in-person interactions will outperform. I like ZM, WORK, MSFT, CRM, NFLX for these reasons especially if a vaccine isn\u2019t developed in a timely fashion or isn\u2019t particularly effective.", "created_utc": 1585547060.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frl61z/thoughts_on_when_the_pandemic_will_end_and_what/", "is_self": true}
