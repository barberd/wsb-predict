Being the weed connoisseur I am, I am currently balls deep in Cresco Labs. I know what you are thinking. You high piece of shit. GO smoke some more dope and I promise you, I will after I give you this. Cresco is currently hiring a FUCK TON of employees and ramping up for Illinois legalization in 2 months and 10 days. I'd screen shot but there's so many positions - I fucking cant fit it all - go check their linkdin and shit. Bordering in oversold territory from a shitty weed stock friday (thanks CTST and ACB you cucks), this company has no debt unlike all the other tarded companies and great financial numbers all around and shaping up to be a great play with all of its licenses for cultivation and dispensaries. Could be a great position to start longing. As always, $TSLA 420C and hail HAUPT!", "created_utc": 1569126533, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d7lq2q/cresco_labs_dd/", "is_self": true}
