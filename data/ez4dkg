{"id": "ez4dkg", "title": "TA pros, please explain this order book thing for ZRX - USD on Coinbase", "selftext": "**ZRX** \\- Large sell order doing weird things on the order book\n\nLooking at ZRX on Coinbase today. See large sell order on the book sitting there waiting to trigger but it never triggers.\n\nWatching the spread, it will start counting down from about 0.000230 or whatever, down to 0.000001. When that happens, the large order will eventually jump to the second spot in a split second, and some other order will flash really quick below it (also in a split second), at the bottom of the sell book. Then the new order that appears will disappear in fraction of a second, and the large order moves back down to bottom of sell order book.\n\nRepeats over and over. Occasionally the large order gets added too probably by other sellers, but somehow, those other orders seem to trigger first, so bot is cancelling the large order and then instantly replacing it at the same position (?), so it's last in the trigger que (?), forcing other orders to get filled first?\n\nBeen happening for hours now and very few orders are getting triggered on either side, as evident by the transaction history.\n\nSame thing happened yesterday at around .23545 and order was exact same size. It never filled and sat there for many hours. Soon as it was removed late last night, the price popped pretty good, which you can see in chart below.\n\n**What is the purpose?** Try to drive down price so they can accumulate more? Or something different. It's still there now, all day long, not filled at all.\n\nOrder book screenshot\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vz5p2ikhi1f41.jpg?width=1353&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d32d7e921533ee8ef43ebc677069174a45c77d4", "created_utc": 1580880098, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ez4dkg/ta_pros_please_explain_this_order_book_thing_for/", "is_self": true}
