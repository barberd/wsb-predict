I'm going to keep you guys updated on the conference call and what else is released about the program and any pipeline updates or data releases. I will also continue to update this thread with the best exit strategy to maximize everyone's gains!\n\nLink to Conference Call:  [http://ir.arrowheadpharma.com/events-and-presentations](http://ir.arrowheadpharma.com/events-and-presentations)\n\nCEO Chris Anzalone announced\n\nentry into the COVID-19 fight & \u201ccoincidentally\u201d followed that up by restating their \u201cUnmatched speed in getting to the clinic.\u201d\n\nThis is an amazing call for ARWR they announced that they're now working on all 3 JNJ targets.\n\nThe Q&A at the end of the call is going to be the most important part\n\n&#x200B;\n\nExit Strategy\n\nThis is not fully what I was expecting but was still an amazing conference call! Don't worry this is typical for ARWR after conference calls not gapping up. It normally takes 2-3 days for the big moves to start I just thought it would be different if they made the announcement which they are keeping disclosed for now.\n\nIm holding my 5/15's into next week as there is a presentation at BofA Securities 2020 Health Care Conference on 5/14. ARWR has stated they are expecting to release data at some of these presentations so this is actually going to be a bigger catalyst.\n\nHere is a list of the future events and catalysts:  [http://ir.arrowheadpharma.com/events-and-presentations](http://ir.arrowheadpharma.com/events-and-presentations)\n\nThis is one of the most undervalued biotechs and I recommend holding your June and further options for a while. The move up is going to start here and it will look similar to before from 40-73 but much faster and higher!\n\nVery specific, time bound trial questions showing analysts are refining model inputs to update price targets. Expect some upgrades next week and possibly even tomorrow morning!", "created_utc": 1588883200.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gfegtn/arwr_earnings_thread_covid19_program_announced/", "is_self": true}
