He said the \u201cturning point\u201d came when the United States learned about the spreading coronavirus only after a Chinese delegation had left Washington following the signing of the Phase 1 deal on Jan. 15.\n\n\u201cIt was at a time when they had already sent hundreds of thousands of people to this country to spread that virus, and it was just minutes after wheels up when that plane took off that we began to hear about this pandemic,\u201d Navarro said.\n\nEdit: DOW futures already down 400pts.
