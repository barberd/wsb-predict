{"id": "fjpoxg", "title": "$TCOM a Chinese travel tourism agency will be dead by June", "selftext": ">*Trip.com Group Limited is a Chinese provider of travel services  including accommodation reservation, transportation ticketing, packaged  tours and corporate travel management. Founded in 1999, the company owns  and operates Trip.com, Skyscanner, and Ctrip.com, all of which are  online travel agencies.*\n\nTCOM is currently in dire straights much like a dog roaming the streets of Yulin, or much like a bat flying around Wuhan. During the bull run, TCOM was already the lesser known travel agency when compared to other sites like Google Flights/Expedia, however now with China being restricted not only on it's own end, but nearly every other part of the world as well, they are completely ass blasted.\n\nTCOM's past earnings for the past 2 years have underperformed each time ranging from -2% forecasted earnings to -24%, this resulted in an average 8% drops the following day after EACH earnings reports (11/13/19, 09/09/19, 05/22/19, 03/04/19)\n\n**The next scheduled earnings report for TCOM is on March 18 after hours.**\n\nSo I know you're all autistic and retarded but do you think it is even remotely possible for them to be profitable when their main source of income, is travel tourism?\n\nSince we are getting IV fucked and all sweating like whores in a Church, I suggest buying longer dated Put options since the premium is much lower, and as well it acts as a safety net in case the talks of temporary market halting go through. June puts currently have the lowest premiums for the price guarantee that I could find, but feel free to take whichever you are most comfortable with.\n\nBest of luck dear autists, I wish you and your families to all stay healthy during these rough times, thoughts and prayers to those afflicted.\n\n***tl;dr*** TCOM 21p 06/19 for cheap premiums. A Chinese travel agency, they have huge drops each earning report, next report is Wednesday, they will fail without a doubt and plummet. Today is an especially good day to buy puts with the micropenis rally", "created_utc": 1584383120.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjpoxg/tcom_a_chinese_travel_tourism_agency_will_be_dead/", "is_self": true}
