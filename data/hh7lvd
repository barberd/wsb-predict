DD down the rabbit hole", "selftext": "Ok, no boring numbers or 10k reports to sift through on this one, just a very plausible theory. \n\nObviously we all know (unless you\u2019re a boomer) Joe Rogan and Kim kardashian are going to podcast exclusively for Spotify. Links provided cos I know you\u2019re all to lazy to google.\n\n[Rogan deal](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/entertainment-arts-52736364)\n\n[kim k deal](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.wsj.com/amp/articles/kim-kardashian-west-lands-podcast-deal-with-spotify-11592427337)\n\nWell here\u2019s why that really matters. A lot of people like me, like to watch the rogan podcast, not listen to it, so spotify clearly wants to directly challenge YT, twitch and FB as a video streaming service. \n\nSo here\u2019s the juicy part, Probably the biggest streamer on twitch has just been banned Dr disrespect after mentioning David Icke on stream. Except the whole thing kind of looks like a pr setup... \n[final moments of his stream](https://youtu.be/pI4amp0Ly2I)\n\nRogan also said one of the main reasons he left was because of YouTube censorship of particular topics, ie mentioning Icke gets you banned. so is Dr disrespect leaving twitch to go somewhere else? \ud83d\udc40 is this him hinting that? \n\nWell here\u2019s the realllll cookie, are ninja, shroud and DR D all going to announce Spotify partnerships soon? They\u2019ve all just turned down a multi-million offer to go to Facebook and there aren\u2019t any other big platforms so whereeeeeee are they going? \ud83d\ude09\n\n[Facebook gaming offer $](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/metro.co.uk/2020/06/23/mixer-shutting-ninja-offered-60-million-join-facebook-gaming-shroud-20-million-12889759/amp/)\n\nPosition?
