{"id": "h9eoav", "title": "June Unemployment Preview got Autists", "selftext": "Deputy Commisar for Autists Larry Kudlow has been moaning about the $600 extra unemployment benefit on TV this weekend.\n\nThis is a four week propaganda prep for the June unemployment numbers.  The story is going to be how small business owners, still bulemic from their massive PPP bailouts, are unable to hire workers because employees don\u2019t want to come back from their paid vacations.  Nevermind we gave 100 million employed Autists $1200 a person so they could give their remote schooled children graduation gifts of Robinhood accounts with 100 shares of Hertz.  \n\nThe actual problem could be solved very simply by paying workers $20 and hour instead of $15 an hour - because that\u2019s how normal market economies work.  But with record unemployment this is the chance to get those fuckers on the payroll for $10 an hour.\n\nBut the other part of the play is having a built in excuse on why June unemployment is 16-17 percent.  The voodoo they played with the May numbers was a one time trick they know they can\u2019t replicate.  \n\nMarkets might be going up even if the June report says unemployment is at 20 percent - but do what you wish with this time travelers prediction.", "created_utc": 1592221325.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h9eoav/june_unemployment_preview_got_autists/", "is_self": true}
