{"id": "gt7l2m", "title": "Short the shorts", "selftext": "\u201cShort seller\u201d J Capital (j cap is their hip, self appointed nickname) published an intentionally provocative report saying to short NovaGold Resources (ticker NG). It included a bunch of provocative sections (entitled things like Original Sin and Fool\u2019s Gold), very clever...\n\nHowever, a rudamentary background check on Tim Murray and Anne Stevenson-Yang (principals at J Cap) shows that these 2 have virtually 0 finance experience or pedigree, let alone expertise in Alaskan Gold mining. In fact, they were previously Cook Book publishers. Tim Murray has gone on record saying:\n\n\u201cEquity research is not that different to publishing\u201d and \u201cI\u2019d never really worked in [finance] but I had run companies, I knew how companies operated and I had been screwed in business in China every single way possible.\u201d\n\nTheir website cites 0 in terms of track record/past performance, in addition to looking like a 3rd grader constructed it. Yet, nonetheless, the stock dipped over 10% based on their \u201cresearch\u201d.\n\nNG will be setting the record straight next week and responding to their claims. Billionaire Dr. Thomas Kaplan is going to author the response and bitch slap J Cap with it by the time he is done. Billionaire hedge fund manager John Paulsen bought NG in Q1\u201920, as he knows the deal. Over 55% of float is owned by institutional investors.\n\nConclusion: buy NG at market open on monday for what should be a cakewalk in terms of rebound.", "created_utc": 1590810818.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gt7l2m/short_the_shorts/", "is_self": true}
