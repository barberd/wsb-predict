Final $1500 dollars. 10K -> 1.5K -> Who the fuck knows ?", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/50vrfqp9xky41.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=a66388cebc176328c802a38f623572ccc8ce35ed\n\nSo first of all, **loss porn**. This one hits hard. My position was 22 contracts of SPY $290P Exp 5/15. I had about 6K worth of those and as you can see my diamond hands didn't last long enough. I would have made BANK on those if I held. Anyways, I'm in the process of trying to rebuild my portfolio, the 10K that I put in is something I promised myself I wouldn't touch until I had a damn good play to justify it but in the end my lack of patience fucked me. \n\nIn an effort to rebuild my fucking savings, this is the position I've taken with what I have left, I understand the market is bleeding, I understand CSCO follows SPY and tanks after earnings, but desperate goddamn times call risky measures. CSCO $44C 5/22. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5kx9yv6xxky41.png?width=1341&format=png&auto=webp&s=5306c9b394881d67280ae6a473f23e1fd955f3e9\n\n**TLDR:** Diamond hands works if you have infinite patience, I clearly did not. Current Position, CSCO $44C 5/22. If any of you queers can help me rebuild my portfolio I will tickle your bootyhole.", "created_utc": 1589396536.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gj5bh2/loss_porn_final_1500_dollars_10k_15k_who_the_fuck/", "is_self": true}
