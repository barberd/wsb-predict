{"id": "bem3as", "title": "$CUBI - potential multibagger", "selftext": "CUBI is a small cap bank which on the surface looks like any other shitty bank ([https://www.customersbank.com/](https://www.customersbank.com/)).\n\nIt's run by a CEO who firmly believes bank branches are dead, so they have largely adopted an asset light approach. The stock trades at less than tangible book value and 10x EPS. \n\nThe most interesting part of this business is Bank Mobile, their whitelabel banking solution ([https://www.bankmobile.com/white-label](https://www.bankmobile.com/white-label)) - look at this site. Tmobile is their first partner and they just launched today. Here is John Legere's tweet [https://twitter.com/JohnLegere/status/1118851025157312517](https://twitter.com/JohnLegere/status/1118851025157312517)  . Basically, you can signup and get a tmobile bank account with higher interest rates than brick and mortar bank similar to other online bank accounts. Internally it is powered by CUBI. \n\nAll this while bank mobile unit has been loss making but it will likely be profitable and will also be fast growth unit given the reception. More importantly, many other companies would likely want to do this as its another revenue stream and creates sticky customers. It wouldn't be surprising if within a year or two this unit alone is worth more than the parent bank.", "created_utc": 1555597106, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bem3as/cubi_potential_multibagger/", "is_self": true}
