I just made mine so here goes: \n\nI bought an SPX 12/31 call when it was on sale late in the day. I wasn\u2019t sure if we\u2019d have a small sell off before a closing rally so I was planning to let the call rise up a bit, lock my gain, then buy a January call around power hour anticipating a closing rally. I just got flagged PDT in the morning and it hadn\u2019t cleared so I figured no big deal the 12/31 call is a few strikes ITM so I\u2019ll just sell the next deeper ITM call and use the proceeds to buy the January call an hour before close. \n\nI waited and watched the chart as SPX slowly rose, pulled back, and rose some more. I figured it was time so I sold the next NTM call (yep!) and locked in a nice little loss. A loss that I had just waited patiently to build up. \n\nAnd after that I didn\u2019t even go back and get the January call. Maybe I\u2019d have clicked sell instead of buy or something. \n\nWhat was your most impressive feat of stupidity this year?", "created_utc": 1577865083, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eiftuc/dumbest_trades_of_2019/", "is_self": true}
