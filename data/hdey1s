That being said, I do think that some long exposure to an inflationary hedge is not without its merits.......enter GLD Jan 22 LEAPS. Unfortunately, this long exposure is quite expensive with ATM ($165) calls selling for \\~$20. \n\nTo combat the expense of this exposure, we take advantage of theta and the volatility smile by selling OTM near term expiration calls. I like to have my short strike be equal to the strike price of the long option + the debit required for the long option \u2014 this way if time value premium somehow gets crushed out with some wild move to the upside and the spread is only worth the width of the strikes, you at least make back the initial debit paid. Ideally, one could sell 5-6 90 DTE OTM calls against this long position, slowly chipping away at your cost basis. \n\nThe net delta for this position, currently, is \\~.4 \u2014\u00a0you can increase it by raising strike of OTM short call or lowering strike of long leap ATM/ITM call.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**GLD: Jan 21 2022/Sep 18 2020 160/180 C Debit Diagonal**", "created_utc": 1592774920.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hdey1s/diagonal_gld_debit_spreads/", "is_self": true}
