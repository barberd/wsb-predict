Basically, I've taken out two Payday loans worth $500 each to \"make money\" trading options on Robinhood. I thought the 2.45% daily interest on the loans wasn't too bad only $2.45 a day! Well, in my previous thread I learned from y'all that it's compounded. I'm fucked.\n\nAt first I went from $1000 to $3000 by buying close to expiration calls and puts on AMD. It was extremely risky, but what the fuck did I know? It was easy money! So, last Friday with the market being down, I decided to spend my entire $2300 on spy calls expiring Monday and Wednesday (mostly Monday). \n\nChecking the premarkets last night I was extremely confident in my positions. Up 0.5%? Hell YEAH, I'm going to make them GAINZ. Wake up. WHAT THE FUCK? Markets don't give a fuck about Trump being quiet. Mango man didn't tweet the entire weekend. Somehow, old Huawei news turned the markets blood red.\n\nThe markets seem like a vagina to me. I'm gay and I have 0 clue how a vagina works. One day is blood the next day it's fine. Who the fuck knows. \n\nSo, I lost Half of my portfolio today but I still have half left because I sold close to the high today. Because I'm an autist, I went balls deep in out of the money AMD calls expiring next Friday. Lisa Su is going to make all the investors \ud83d\udca6 at Computex. It's confirmed trust me. \n\nSee you boys next week after them GAINZ. \ud83d\ude18\n\nHere's my portfolio\n\nhttps://m.imgur.com/a/SxjACC9", "created_utc": 1558385588, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/br16fw/i_got_it_wrong_and_might_default_on_my_payday/", "is_self": true}
