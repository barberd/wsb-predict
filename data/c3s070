I looked to see any stocks that deal with it and found ASPN, currently at around $6 a share and steadily rising.\n\nDo you think it's a nice buy? I'm very new to this so if I'm saying things I shouldn't be saying please PM me and I'll delete this thread. \n\nAny advice appreciated with this specific stock.\nThanks", "created_utc": 1561222470, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c3s070/aspn_aerogel_stock/", "is_self": true}
