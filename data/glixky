They help consumers, small businesses and self employed with finances and compliance through Quickboooks, Turbotax and mint, etc. \n\nSales and Revenue patterns are heavily concentrated November - April \n\n\\- They did take on debt in 2019 which they are continuing to pay down into 2021 and made good progress on in 2020. Short term debt and long term debt decreased yoy. \n\n\\- Purchases CreditKarma in Feb 2020 for $7.1B which has not yet gone through\n\n\\- Historically, they perform well in downturns but this is unlike anything we've ever seen\n\n\\- Tax extensions got pushed back to July this year which will affect their Q1 numbers\n\n\\- [Small Business Impact on Intuit from COVID](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/turbotax-maker-intuit-hit-by-coronavirus-impact-on-small-businesses-tax-extension-2020-05-07)\n\n[Cut Q3 outlook and removed 2020 Guidance already](https://www.zdnet.com/article/intuit-cuts-q3-outlook-withdraws-2020-guidance-on-covid-19-impact/) \n\n**Things to keep in mind (right from their 10k)**\n\n\" Decreased consumer spending levels could also reduce credit and debit card transaction processing volumes causing reductions in our payments revenue. Poor economic conditions and high unemployment have caused, and could in the future cause, a significant decrease in the number of tax returns filed, which may have a significant effect on the number of tax returns we prepare and file. In addition, weakness in the end-user consumer and small business markets could negatively affect the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could, in turn, delay paying their obligations to us, which could increase our credit risk exposure and cause delays in our recognition of revenue or future sales to these customers. Any of these events could harm our business and our future financial results.\"\n\nGiven all of this terrible news.. they still rallied into EOD Friday. \n\nThey report Thursday After Close and i'm buying some fucking PUTS cuz their forward guidance is going to be an absolute dumpster fire. \n\nThey dipped down to 273 last week i think it's possible they could dump back somewhere around $250 after earnings. Volume is kind of low right now, but i'm not worried about that as i'll hold through earnings anyway.\n\nPositions: $270 Put exp 5/22\n\nThoughts?", "created_utc": 1589734887.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/glixky/intuit_earnings_play_521_after_close/", "is_self": true}
