I\u2019m not here to ask which company I should invest I\u2019m well aware of the rules of this sub. I wanted to get started a while ago and found your sub which I found quite amusing and interesting. I\u2019ve seen that most of you are using Robinhood as a trade app however being in France this app ain\u2019t available (seems to be only us) if there is some french people in this sub, what app are you using by any chance or if anybody know an app working internationally it would be great. And then another question is I\u2019m a bit lost on some of the vocabulary use in this sub and wonder if someone have a sub to some kind of lexicon of this sub as I tried to look for it. (I understand that most abbreviation stand for the name in the market of company like Tesla-&gt; TSLA Microsoft -&gt; MSFT etc.. but get stuck on things like Tendies (even though I have a guess it would help to understand your sub better) \n\nMany thanks to everyone who will be keen to help.", "created_utc": 1581773637, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f49gdt/rookie_better/", "is_self": true}
