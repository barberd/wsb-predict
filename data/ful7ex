{"id": "ful7ex", "title": "Oil Round Two: Cool title I know", "selftext": "If you need or want to know more about the oil and gas industry in general, the price war and falling demand you can read my previous thread (long af, also some really insightful comments from others) here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fs722a/primer\\_on\\_the\\_oil\\_and\\_gas\\_industry\\_demand/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fs722a/primer_on_the_oil_and_gas_industry_demand/)\n\n**TL;DR V2.0: Fuck, some of you have the attention span of a gnat. When and if the OPEC+ meeting takes place and cuts happen (including the US and other major producers), oil will jump and stabilize (I'm guessing) around high $30s to mid $40s/bbl. But cuts will not be enough to offset the upcoming storage crisis, so it will drop again over the next few months. If the US doesn't participate, there will be no cuts and its a race to the bottom.**\n\n**Positions:** Cash gang gang. Exited everything this morning because I was bleeding tendies and wanted a break. I am restricted by my job (cover news for oil and gas at an industry-specific data and analytics firm) from participating directly in energy markets, so I have and will have no stakes in anything that touches oil and gas.\n\nOk, round two. My last thread was a primer on the industry, and since there is a massively important OPEC+ meeting next week\u2014however it shakes out\u2014I figured I would write another thread about what\u2019s going on and what could happen. Some of this will unavoidably be speculation because it deals with things that haven\u2019t happened yet, but I promise I won\u2019t pull anything out of my ass other than all those big green dildo-candles from the past two weeks. Again, I\u2019m not giving you specific trades because 1) do your own DD and 2) I suck at trading and you really don\u2019t want my advice.\n\n**You get cuts, You get cuts, Everyone Gets Cuts!**\n\nOil got a kick in the pants yesterday when Trump tweeted that Saudi Arabia and Russia were going to agree to cut 10-15 MMbo/d of production. A lot of people immediately called bullshit, including Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov. However, later in the day Saudi Arabia called for an emergency meeting of OPEC+, which has been scheduled for Monday (may have been moved to the 8th or 9th now). Both Saudi Arabia and Russia have since said that they would be willing to make cuts of at least 10 MMbo, while also blaming each other for the price war (that Russia instigated and Saudi Arabia started).\n\nThe likelihood of OPEC+ alone agreeing to cut 10+ MMbo/d is pretty fucking low\u2014I would say near zero. The cuts can happen, but it will have to involve the US and other major non-OPEC+ producers (Canada, Brazil, etc.), and Russia has said as much. Russia did not agree to the previous attempt to cut production in early March because every OPEC+ cut for the past three years has been back-filled by increases in US shale production (also sanctions on Rosneft and Nord Steam 2 probably). Agreeing to cuts that don\u2019t involve the US will put them back at square one, and really even further back than that, as the other elephant in the room (15-20 MMbo/d drop in demand) will still be around and there hasn\u2019t been enough time to do truly lasting damage to US producers.\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled by the bankruptcy of Whiting Petroleum; something like 50 US O&G companies filed for bankruptcy last year if I remember correctly, which was not unusual. If oil prices magically went back to \u201cnormal\u201d next week and stayed that way, the number of bankruptcies likely wouldn\u2019t be significantly higher\u2014I can\u2019t find the note from my firm, but if I remember correctly, analysts were anticipating a 10% increase in Chapter 11 filings (so \\~55) before the price war began.\n\nNow, you may be thinking something along the lines of, \u201cThis is fucking \u2018Merica, we would never hobble the free market and limit production\u201d. Well, think again: it\u2019s not certain, but it is definitely a possibility. First off, there is historic precedent. Before OPEC came on the scene and started setting global prices in the 1970s, that job fell to the Texas Railroad Commission, which is still the regulatory agency for O&G in the state. The TRC began putting a quota on Texas oil production in the late 1930s after an oil boom in East Texas pushed prices down to $0.25/bbl. That agency effectively set world oil prices for the next three decades.\n\nIf you want a more recent example that is still comparable to the US (as far as having a free market economy and no NOC), look at Canada and Alberta. AB has been stuck between a rock and a hard place since 2016, with significant capital flight occurring in the oil patch due to lack of takeaway capacity and regulatory uncertainty. In 2018, because of that lack of takeaway capacity (mostly pipelines), oil storage filled nearly to the brim and differentials between the Canadian benchmark WCS and WTI collapsed. In order to protect the industry, the provincial government introduced production curtailments near the end of the year. Some companies complained about it, but many realized it was the only option they had.\n\nThey initially planned to end curtailment last year, but around August or September decided it would have to extend into 2020. As storage volumes have fallen and more takeaway capacity has come online\u2014either through crude-by-rail or pipeline throughput optimizations\u2014the provincial government has eased curtailment limits. They also began applying new exemptions, such as new conventional oil wells would be exempt from curtailment and producers could produce beyond their limits as long as the extra output was transported by rail. When the policy was first introduced, the first 10,000 bo/d was exempted from curtailment (protecting small producers), and that was expanded to the first 20,000 bo/d last fall. For anyone that produced over that\u2014only 16 in Alberta with the 20k limit\u2014the province applied a formula, which I won\u2019t bother detailing here, to determine how much a company could produce so that overall production in the province stayed below the limit.\n\nSo, I\u2019m not sure that the US federal government has the political will or ability to impose nationwide production quotas, but some states could. In fact, producers in Texas have already called for the TRC to pick up its old mantle and begin placing limits on production. One of the regulator\u2019s commissioners has also called for a 10% production cut in the state, and the TRC plans on considering a cut at its next meeting. Of course, this is not a universally popular proposal (just as Alberta\u2019s wasn\u2019t) and some producers like Chevron are already complaining, but that won\u2019t necessarily stop the TRC from imposing cuts.\n\nState-level action, particularly from Texas, may be enough to convince OPEC+ to agree to cuts. Ohh, and Alberta Premier Jason Kenney and Trudeau have both said they would be willing to work with OPEC on cuts. And what state or provincial regulators don\u2019t do, low oil prices will do for them. US E&P companies have already been shutting in uneconomic production, and that will continue or accelerate as long as oil prices remain depressed.\n\n**You see the elephant over there next to the bus crash?**\n\nI\u2019ve already mentioned it twice, but do you remember what the other problem is besides the price war? An estimated drop\u2014by Goldman Sachs, Vitol and others\u2014in global oil demand of 15-20 MMbo/d at beer flu\u2019s peak. Even with a 10 MMbo cut, it won\u2019t be enough to keep storage levels from continuing to rise in the near-term. According to a recent Financial Times article, Kayrros satellite measurements indicated global crude stocks surged by over 100 MMbbl in March to 63% of nameplate storage capacity. We have never tested the maximum operating capacity of storage on a global level, so no one really knows what it is, how soon we reach it, or what exactly happens if we do. One thing we do know, and again we can look to Alberta circa 2018 for this, is that prices plummet as storage nears capacity.\n\nIt could get to the point that oil prices go negative and producers have to pay someone to take oil away. Now if that happens, producers would only be paying as long as it takes them to safely shut in all of their wells. And global storage capacity is a bit of a misnomer, because storage is regional and not global. If all the tanks that are tied to the Permian are full, it doesn\u2019t matter if there is an empty tank in Nigeria, because you can\u2019t get the oil there. Some pipeline operators in the Permian have already asked their clients to reduce production rates because storage is filling up.\n\nFatih Birol, the International Energy Agency\u2019s executive director, spoke on the demand problem recently. He told Reuters that even if everyone agrees to global cuts of 10 MMbo/d, oil inventories would still rise by 15 MMbo/d in Q2. That will put significant downward pressure on oil prices.\n\n**So what the fuck is going to happen? Here comes the speculation.**\n\nI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen on Monday, but here are how I see various scenarios playing out in my crystal ball.\n\n1. OPEC+ cuts production by 10 MMbo/d, US is free and clear to do what it wants. I really don\u2019t see this happening. I guess it\u2019s a non-zero chance, but it has to be a small one. They\u2019ve never cut production by more than 2.1 MMbo/d, and in March were only looking for 3.6 MMbo/d. You think they are desperate enough to triple that, totally fuck themselves, and let us go without a scratch? Maybe Saudi Arabia would, but Putin would give his balls a tug, grit his teeth and soldier on. Or, I could be totally fucking wrong. If anyone can give a convincing argument for why this is a likely outcome, I am genuinely interested in hearing it (so I can steal it for work).\n2. Talks fall apart and nothing happens, price war continues, pretty simple outcome. Oil will fucking tank, O&G company stocks will tank, blood in the streets. Sub-$10/bbl WTI here we come (maybe not right away, but sooner rather than later). Production effectively stops region by region as storage fills to capacity until we reach a balancing point, if one exists in this nightmare scenario.\n3. This is complex shit and they agree to do something, but they need time to hash out the details. This one is fucking boring, which means it\u2019s what will probably happen because fuck us. I\u2019m guessing prices will get a decent boost, but remaining uncertainty will pare gains somewhat. Or it might be as good as agreeing to 10+ MMbo/d cuts (or lead to the cuts), in which case look at the next one.\n4. OPEC+ and non-OPEC+ producers agree to cuts on the order of at least 10 MMbo/d. In the near term, oil prices will see an immediate positive impact. I think they\u2019ll stabilize in the $40-50/bbl range, which is where they were before the price war started. Maybe high $30s/low $40s as beer flu has spread more since then. This will make Putin particularly happy, because he will get to reign in US shale, balance his budget (needs average $42/bbl) and keep sticking it to Saudi Arabia a bit (they need $82/bbl to balance their budget).\n\nUS Producers I have to imagine would get a boost to their stock prices too, but they might have some downward pressure from mandated cuts at whatever level they occur (not enough to outweigh the good news though, probably). It would be a good idea for you to look at Canadian producers\u2019 stock prices on the TSX, particularly larger producers who primarily operate in Alberta (such as oil sands) and how their stocks moved around the time curtailment was announced there (late 2018) and since. However, if you do that, remember Canadian companies were facing significant downward pressure from other sources such as regulatory uncertainty.\n\nThe upswing would likely be relatively short lived though. Over the next quarter or two\u2014depending on how long beer flu bends global demand over the table\u2014prices would start dropping again as storage fills up. Pure-plays (companies who only operate in one area/basin) would be particularly vulnerable to storage filling up in their region to the point that they have to entirely shut in all production. Diversified companies, particularly the supermajors, would hold out longer.\n\nThis scenario could lead to more cuts, but I sort of doubt it. Any cuts are going to be a hard sell, particularly on the scale we need them to be. Round two would be even worse. I also don\u2019t think the pandemic will last long enough. However, recovery is going to take a lot longer. First the world has to get back to whatever the fuck it was doing before beer flu, and then demand has to pick back up to something like last year\u2019s levels. Then, we have to slowly whittle down storage levels (Alberta has been at it for over a year, but Canada is a dumpster fire, so YMMV) and hope nothing else gets fucked up. As storage approaches normal levels, prices improve. If I was a betting man, I would wager a return to normal, or close to it, during the first half of next year, maybe Q1 if I was optimistic.\n\n**BUT WHAT TRADES DO I MAKE ASSHOLE?!**\n\nI told you, you don\u2019t want my shit advice. If you made it this far, do some more of your own research and flip a coin on what will happen Monday, then make the appropriate bets. If you go for calls, unless they are LEAPs, be prepared to switch to puts later in the quarter regardless of what happens.\n\nEdits: News came out about the meeting being moved since I wrote this, noted the update in the text.\n\nSome sources (again, not all, not even sure y\u2019all can access all of these)\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/global-oil-texas-opec/oil-pipeline-producer-standoff-prompts-new-call-for-texas-shale-curbs-idUSL1N2BH2GM](https://www.reuters.com/article/global-oil-texas-opec/oil-pipeline-producer-standoff-prompts-new-call-for-texas-shale-curbs-idUSL1N2BH2GM)\n\n[https://www.dailyoilbulletin.com/article/2020/4/3/deep-oil-output-cuts-wont-offset-unprecedented-dem/](https://www.dailyoilbulletin.com/article/2020/4/3/deep-oil-output-cuts-wont-offset-unprecedented-dem/)\n\n[https://www.dailyoilbulletin.com/article/2020/4/3/trudeau-says-canada-talking-to-opec-us-about-oil-p/](https://www.dailyoilbulletin.com/article/2020/4/3/trudeau-says-canada-talking-to-opec-us-about-oil-p/)\n\n[https://www.alberta.ca/oil-production-limit.aspx](https://www.alberta.ca/oil-production-limit.aspx)\n\n[https://boereport.com/2020/04/02/saudi-wants-cooperation-to-bolster-oil-blames-russia-for-turmoil/](https://boereport.com/2020/04/02/saudi-wants-cooperation-to-bolster-oil-blames-russia-for-turmoil/)\n\n[https://boereport.com/2020/04/03/putin-says-russia-agrees-on-oil-output-cuts-blames-saudis-for-low-prices/](https://boereport.com/2020/04/03/putin-says-russia-agrees-on-oil-output-cuts-blames-saudis-for-low-prices/)\n\n[https://www.dailyoilbulletin.com/article/2020/4/2/trump-does-not-plan-to-ask-us-oil-producers-for-co/](https://www.dailyoilbulletin.com/article/2020/4/2/trump-does-not-plan-to-ask-us-oil-producers-for-co/)\n\n[https://www.ft.com/content/79b7dc43-da6b-4027-b68f-a177524972b6](https://www.ft.com/content/79b7dc43-da6b-4027-b68f-a177524972b6)\n\n[https://www.ft.com/content/1da60fa2-3d63-439e-abd4-1391a2047972?ftcamp=traffic/partner/feed\\_headline/us\\_yahoo/auddev&yptr=yahoo](https://www.ft.com/content/1da60fa2-3d63-439e-abd4-1391a2047972?ftcamp=traffic/partner/feed_headline/us_yahoo/auddev&yptr=yahoo)\n\n[https://boereport.com/2020/04/01/oil-prices-mixed-u-s-inventory-build-up-heightens-oversupply-concerns/](https://boereport.com/2020/04/01/oil-prices-mixed-u-s-inventory-build-up-heightens-oversupply-concerns/)\n\n[https://www.upstreamonline.com/production/oil-extends-upward-trend-as-opec-set-for-emergency-meeting/2-1-787977](https://www.upstreamonline.com/production/oil-extends-upward-trend-as-opec-set-for-emergency-meeting/2-1-787977)", "created_utc": 1585965124.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ful7ex/oil_round_two_cool_title_i_know/", "is_self": true}
