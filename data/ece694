I'm guilty of this too, and I know now that what I did was wrong. So in order to not do that again, I've come up with a new strategy to go about shitty companies.\n\nDuring the WeWork \"IPO Roadshow\" or whatever they called it, we definitely should've downvoted any negative news about it and talked about how awesome WeWork is, called Goldman Sachs asking when shares would be available, etc.\n\nIt's like a \"pump and dump\" on a large-scale because you can't be sued for talking positively about a company that's not even trading yet.\n\nThen, as soon as the shitty company goes public, we start shorting the stock and buying put options, and get way more money than we would have if the stock never had a chance to IPO. Adam Neuman also would've been fucked, and he never would've walked away with $1 BILLION. \n\nNOW a \"new\" co-working space is gaining traction, and we HAVE TO get it to IPO! The new company, which has already raised like $100,000,000 in venture funding (INCLUDING investments from WeWork, no shit) is [\"The Wing\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wing_(workspace)), which is a sexist coworking space that only caters to women, or at least it did until several lawsuits were filed, so now they lost their only \"competitive advantage\", which was to cater to women. Which of course is against the law, for the same reason that women have ruined \"Men's Only Clubs\" throughout the country.\n\nBut TheWing is still basically only accepting women as members, which means that you should definitely apply anyways, and also show up to events because it's sexist/against the law if they don't admit you.\n\nAnd ANYTIME you hear news about this bogus company, DOWNVOTE it and talk about \"women empowerment\", how important a company like that is, blah blah blah, whatever it takes to get it to IPO.\n\nDon't make the same mistake twice!!", "created_utc": 1576683452, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ece694/the_long_short_lessons_learned_from_weworks/", "is_self": true}
