Writing naked SPY calls have been consistent in this week market regime, which in my view is likely to continue for at least several months.\n\n\ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2640\ufe0f usually trends down 88% of the time and today opex was consistent with that statistic.\n\nIt's nice seeing greens everyday and I view it as less risky then starting a small business with my capital, what business would earn me 1-3% ROI over a few days ? Pretty much same risk, opening up a small convenience store nowadays is likely to get looted and/or windows smashed. Buying a subway franchise in COVID19 time ? that's even more retarded. Both those venture stand a good chance of loosing it all within the first year anyway.\n\nWith my premium's tendies I've ordered the purple mattress king size hybrid, For the sheets I went with /u/Th_rgoodJenkins suggestion, Parachute. It feels very good on the skin, Egyptian cotton is NICE.\n\nWhen my other short 8 x 320C 6/22 expire next week, besides SPY 300P 6/26 I'm buying this \n\n[https://www.amazon.com/VIVO-Electric-Motorized-Pitched-Ceiling/dp/B01GGR6I24](https://www.amazon.com/VIVO-Electric-Motorized-Pitched-Ceiling/dp/B01GGR6I24)\n\nand \n\n[https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-43-inch-Crystal-TU-7000-Built/dp/B084Q2BTKN/ref=sr\\_1\\_3?dchild=1&keywords=40-inch+4K+TV&qid=1592537999&refinements=p\\_89%3ASamsung&rnid=2528832011&sr=8-3](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-43-inch-Crystal-TU-7000-Built/dp/B084Q2BTKN/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=40-inch+4K+TV&qid=1592537999&refinements=p_89%3ASamsung&rnid=2528832011&sr=8-3)\n\nFor my bedroom so I can smirk smugly at  DCT's  stream of bulls getting theta crushed as I doze off on my new mattress and sheet.\n\n**writing strike strategy** : Don't do too much math with black-scholes/stoch calc, gamma and vega shit, It'll only make you lose money. Just stare at the **320** resistance in the chart, and sing this to the retard bulls\n\n**En Vogue - My Lovin' (Never Gonna Get It)**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIuYQ\\_4TcXg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIuYQ_4TcXg)\n\n>No, you're never gonna get it  \n>  \n>Never ever gonna get it (no, not this FY)  \n>  \n>No, you're never gonna get it (my strike)  \n>  \n>Never ever gonna get it", "created_utc": 1592610596.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hcbome/vampire_bear_been_winning_all_week/", "is_self": true}
