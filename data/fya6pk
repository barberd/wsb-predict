{"id": "fya6pk", "title": "Why you should be a Bear and a Bull in this Market", "selftext": "Real talk. I was one of those guys buying into the whole \"diamond hands\" when it comes to puts. Yes, at the time it may have seemed like a great idea and all, but we know that all of our investments turned to absolute shit. The game-plan now is to not bet against the fed; I don't need any advanced charts to predict what I'm saying or have any evidence backing up what comes to pass. But, I will tell you this. In the short term, calls are going to be the way to go. Forget anything you ever thought about markets or how they move on mathematical lines and shit, this case is absolutely different. The FED is propping up the economy for the time being. Buying into short term puts now is suicide, literally. We have never seen the FED print so much damn money that even the idea that the economy can suddenly re-implode is nothing but a pipe dream now, at least for the time being. A huge downturn is just not going to happen. All earnings reports, unemployment figures, mean nothing. \n\nWhy? Because ***companies can blame it on the beer virus.*** As long as this virus remains a huge public concern, which it will at least in the month of April, possibly May, stonks will go up. Forget your bullshit TAs saying this shit will go down anytime soon, because they're only partially right. Yes, the stonk market will go down, but only when Q3 happens. Q3 is going to be the defining moment where we see companies live or die (If the world economy, specifically the US economy, reopens). \n\nWhy? When the US economy opens back up in May or June, earnings reports are going to either go up or go down, if they are near or above projections, stonks go up. If earnings are lower or near lower than expected, stonks go down. I don't expect you retards to know this, but I am telling you now. ***The market will return back to normal once the dust has cleared.*** Powell clearly stated in his Q&A yesterday that the FED will relax policies once they see the US economy recovering. If we open the economy, that is where the real figures start to pour in. We are currently in a fake pumped up economy and the lower the earnings reports are in Q3, the more stonks will go down. The more the FED does not have to intervene, the lower stonks will go up and will eventually go down; that's only if companies are earning more than expected. If they are doing poorly than expected, stonks will go down. You will expect a huge crash in some companies when their earnings reports don't match projections.  ***The FED is responsible for crushing your puts. Watch their actions and watch them closely. Put yourself in the FED's position and ask yourself \"Wow yeah this seems like a great idea to continue what we have never done before, or should we turn back the dial?\"***\n\nTake this day by day. Only keep your calls/puts if you were to buy into them again today. Don't hold at -95% because you think the next big drop is going to happen. Play it smart, win, lose, and learn. That's the name of the game; people get burned; and so will you; just learn from your mistakes and don't get burned as hard as all of those other guys bag holding their puts. \n\nTLDR: Stonks will go up as long as the FED pumps money into the economy like we have never seen. When they start to relax, that means it is time to buy some puts, some calls. If you want to buy puts, remember some of the companies who benefited from this quarantine. If you want to buy calls, remember the companies that were severely (and negatively) affected by it. \n\nPositions: \n\nShort term: SPY 289 C 4/17\n\nLong term: DAL 30 C 1/15 add any severely down travel and hotel stonk you can find and you're solid. These businesses will continue to exist and always will.\n\nP.S. All of you are gay and I love you.", "created_utc": 1586500534.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fya6pk/why_you_should_be_a_bear_and_a_bull_in_this_market/", "is_self": true}
