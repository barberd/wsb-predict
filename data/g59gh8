Now their war on the price to hurt piggy #3 has left them much deeper into a hole then they projected.\n\nThe third piggy is now on a ventilator because he is so sick and in even worse economic shape than the other two piggy\u2019s cause he's the bitch of the trio and has no control over anything, so technically piggy #1 and #2\u2019s plan low key worked.\n\nAnd now, the pigs are still sick, the wolf is still on the prowl. And the product is so oversupplied it is nearing being worth zero.\n\nCredits:\n\nPiggy #1 -Saudi Arabia (MBS)\n\nPiggy #2 -Russia (Putin)\n\nPiggy #3 \u2013 USA\n\n**P.S: Bill Ackman is a squid.**", "created_utc": 1587447312.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g59gh8/economic_events_explained_using_childrens_stories/", "is_self": true}
