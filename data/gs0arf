It will be like MrBabyMan leaving Digg for Reddit (kuz that probably happened). All because Twitter wanted to give us these stupid things called facts. Who needs those when we only have a 144 characters to type a world changing message anyway?\n\nDon't bet against the mouse and don't bet against the POTUS.\n\nMark Zuckerberg, said censoring a platform would not be the \u201cright reflex\" so hes signlaling that Facebook may layoff their mods anyway. Since mods are gay the LGBT community may be up in arms about losing their jannies. That said, layoffs are great for profit margins and stocks go up when that happens. \n\nFB to 260 tomorrow for sure. Twitter probably drops below 30 but dont be a sucker and buy the dip, its a dead cat bounce for sure.", "created_utc": 1590644177.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gs0arf/hope_youre_holding_some_twitter_puts_fb_calls/", "is_self": true}
