{"id": "d28wic", "title": "KeVita &amp; $PEP - DD Brought to you by Daddy Bezos", "selftext": "Went to Daddy Bezo's grocery store over the weekend. Got me some tendies from the hotbar as I searched for the next opportunity. They were trying to give away samples of KeVita - when I asked why, they said that kaka don't fly off the shelves. Now, I am no Kombucha sensei, but that shit is putrid. $PEP fully acquired KeVita in late 2016 as they try to sling some bevos Becky's way - sure enough, no Becky reaching for free KeVita tendies. Feel an earnings miss &amp; forecast slash coming for $PEP.", "created_utc": 1568128317, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d28wic/kevita_pep_dd_brought_to_you_by_daddy_bezos/", "is_self": true}
