{"id": "e74fiv", "title": "Let's talk about $DG", "selftext": "Firstly, I don't know why this stock isn't more popular here. Seems like most you 'tards ought to be shopping here to begin with.\n\nBut let's see what's actually happening. $DLTR made all the headlines because they suck and $DG has unfairly been compared to it. $DG operates in less competitive markets and has much more flexibility with margin. They continue to innovate like putting Western Unions/Telemundo cards in and DG Fresh. It's like a mini Walmart with high margins. And most importantly, they absolutely blew out earnings on every metric. Beat top and bottom line, same store sale growth over 4%, and they announced expanding to open another 2,600 stores. On top of all this, they raised guidance. Yet the stock price hasn't done anything.\n\nOn the macro picture, things are great. We saw job numbers blow out expectations. Most importantly, the *types* of jobs are what matters. Data shows that while unemployment is low, the quality of jobs is also low. This is the perfect scenario for a company like $DG. Tons of employed people making low incomes. WTF you think they are going to do?\n\nI have almost 50 contracts riding on this stock and it has never failed me before. Therefore, I'm going to need to rest of you autists to line up and YOLO everything you have into it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gxgg98l1u2341.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe09159f159e25476e77c863b3c9139245f232c2", "created_utc": 1575665814, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e74fiv/lets_talk_about_dg/", "is_self": true}
