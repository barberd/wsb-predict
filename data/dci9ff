Hence posting here.\n\nSo these EVs gonna need charging. I want to buy companies that help with charging. 10-15 year time I have. Can afford to lose it all. Best companies?\n\nAll I know are PLUG and BLNK. Maybe PLUG does something else I'm not sure. Plus there are other companies like Tesla that are going to take a good share probably. Who knows papa Bezos gonna get involved too.\n\nPlease don't criticize my post I have a weak heart though strong enough to have lost 40% of my portfolio in a year. Can take losses but can't take criticism.", "created_utc": 1570057760, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dci9ff/what_are_the_best_bets_on_ev_charging_companies/", "is_self": true}
