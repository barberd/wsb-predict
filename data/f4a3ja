I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 17th, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks expected to rise even as virus creates volatility: \u2018The market thinks the worst is over\u2019  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/14/stocks-expected-to-rise-even-as-virus-creates-volatility-the-market-thinks-the-worst-is-over.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks are likely to remain hostage to developments involving the coronavirus in the week ahead, and even so, the market could continue to hit new highs.\n*****\n&gt; Economists have been reducing China\u2019s growth outlook for the quarter, with some seeing little or no growth and then a bounce back in the high single digits next quarter. The U.S. economy is not expected to take a big hit, but the question for the stock market is how will corporate earnings be impacted.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt does feel as though the market thinks the worst is over,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cThe pace of change is slowing. None of us really know, and there\u2019s a lot of skepticism, including in Washington that they can\u2019t believe what\u2019s coming out of China.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Keon believes the market looks poised to head higher and it is trading as if the virus will not make a big dent in the economy or profits. \u201cThe market didn\u2019t really get much of a drawback, compared to SARS or other episodes. There\u2019s no doubt he world will suffer a hit over the first and second quarter and maybe longer,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Companies reporting earnings in the coming week include Walmart Tuesday; ViacomCBS Thursday, and Deere on Friday. Hyatt Hotels reports Wednesday, and Norwegian Cruise Lines reports Thursday. Economic releases include Tuesday\u2019s Empire State and Thursday\u2019s Philadelphia Fed manufacturing surveys, as well as Markit PMI on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; There are also a parade of Fed speakers, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, Fed Governor Lael Brainard and Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan.\n*****\n&gt; # Profit warnings\n&gt; Some companies are already raising warnings, like Cisco which said orders were down and that the forward-looking numbers were not factoring in potential supply chain disruptions. Nvidia said it would take a $100 million hit from the virus, but its revenue forecast was still above expectations.\n*****\n&gt; Under Armour said its sales will be impacted by the virus, when it projected disappointing revenue growth this week. Estee Lauder said its sales will be hit by a decline in travel-related luxury sales.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis is going to start to show up because it will affect supply chains\u201d and exporters, said Keon. \u201cIt will have a negative impact. But at the moment, at least, it doesn\u2019t look like it will be a huge deal to companies in the U.S...It will be a factor. The question is, is it a lasting factor that will hurt them through the year, or is it a quarter or two and then gets back to normal. None of us know.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; About 64,000 people, mostly in China, have been infected and about 1,400 have died from the virus.\n*****\n&gt; Barry Knapp, Ironsides Macroeconomics director of research, said he sees only a minor impact on U.S. corporate earnings.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere will be some hits in some of the consumer companies that have reasonably big businesses in China. I see this as being a fairly small effect on the U.S.,\u201d Knapp said. He said the disruption to the supply chain should not be nearly as bad as it was when Japan was hit by a tsunami and earthquake in 2011.\n*****\n&gt; He expects stocks to continue to move higher, ending the year higher, but he says the market could run into turbulence in the spring when the Fed discusses cutting back its purchases of Treasury bills.\n*****\n&gt; For now, the Fed asset purchases, a strong U.S. consumer and the positive benefit to business spending from the trade deal should help drive stocks higher. But by April or May, the Fed could become a negative. \u201cCould we go up another 3 or 4% between now and then? Sure, we could,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Knapp said since World War II, market corrections fanned by Fed policy changes have resulted in brief pullbacks, averaging about 8%. He said the market should then rebound. \u201cIt trades in a range for a quarter or two and then resumes its uptrend,\u201d he said, noting the uptrend could coincide with the presidential election this year.\n*****\n&gt; # Resilient market\n&gt; Even with the negative news and doubts about the virus, analysts say the market has the momentum to move higher. But Robert Sluymer, technical analyst with Fundstrat, said the market may stay range bound for awhile until there\u2019s more clarity on the virus.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI had a 3,340 to 3,360 [on the S&amp;P 500] as the point where the market starts to consolidate, and we\u2019re there,\u201d said Sluymer. \u201cI don\u2019t have a year-end target but I think it\u2019s higher. I think we\u2019re in a sloppy range. I think it\u2019s range bound.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; But Sluymer also said he thinks the market is just pausing. \u201cStocks are consolidating above support. The market is acting incredibly resilient and it still looks like an intermediate term pause, a consolidation,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Keon said he\u2019s looking for more gains though the market will continue to be swung by virus-related headlines. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to work its way higher, not at the pace you saw last year. But that\u2019s the way we have our portfolios positioned \u2014 the market will work its way higher this year,\u201d he said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zGXae0P.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ZsVPAZO.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DE2dIMR.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/iGBF28x.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/rMe9946.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ps9FL8g.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/C48fTcF.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lJgq8up.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/j9w4IR8.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CKn6MfJ.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/A3rPbpC.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/QLBnp9J.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/SfzBNHl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# February Expiration Week: S&amp;P 500 Up 12 of Last 14\n\n&gt; February\u2019s option expiration day has been down more often than not over the past 26 years with an average loss of 0.20% for S&amp;P 500. Despite a bumpy finish, expiration week as a whole has fared better, but nets an average gain of just 0.47% on the S&amp;P 500 since 1994 with 17 of 26 winning weeks. More recently, S&amp;P 500 has advanced in twelve of the last fourteen options expiration weeks. The week after, has been down 13 of the last 26 years.

But the two days after still display a lot of red. Since 1990 Tuesday after Presidents\u2019 Day has been strongest for the S&amp;P 500 with 18 gains and 12 losses for median gain of 0.14% and an average loss of \u20130.22%. DJIA also has more gains than losses on the Tuesday after, but NASDAQ is net loser down 18 of 30 years with and average loss of \u20130.50% and a median loss of \u20130.21%.\n\n&gt; Wednesday is all red for all three major averages. NASDAQ and S&amp;P 500 have more losses, but DJIA has greater magnitude of decline. On the Wednesday after the Presidents\u2019 Day holiday DJIA is down 16 of 30 with an average loss of \u20130.08% and a median decline of \u20130.16%. S&amp;P 500 is down 18 of 30, average \u20130.04%, median \u20130.11% and NASDAQ is down 17 of 30, average \u20130.04%, median \u20130.14%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7361619e7cab4e66e7b763004f9ece08/171366798232cbac-89/s500x750/150244b6c1313f56a10c2f665ae84006aa531790.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Closer Look At February\n\n&gt; A late month selloff in January saw the S&amp;P 500 Index close marginally lower for the month. But stocks have taken off in February, with the S&amp;P 500 up nearly 4% this month, as US economic data remains strong and fears over the worst-case scenarios for the coronavirus appear overblown.\n\n&gt; Historically, February has been a month when stocks tend to take a bit of a break. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 has been flat, on average, during the second month of an election year. What is most interesting, though, is how weak October has been historically leading up to presidential elections, yet how strong stocks have been in November and December as political uncertainty clears following elections.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SP-500-index-average-monthly-returns-during-an-election-year.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Maybe the big gains so far this month shouldn\u2019t be a total surprise? \u201cYes, February historically has been a troublesome month for stocks,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cYet over the past decade, no month has seen better returns.\u201d In fact, the S&amp;P 500 has gained 2.34% on average in February over the past decade, compared with the second best month of October\u2019s gain of 2.29%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/february-is-usually-weak-but-has-been-the-best-month-the-past-10-years.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Record Pace of Records\n\n&gt; Let's preface this with the fact that it's still early in the year and the rest of the year is unlikely to closely follow the path we have seen so far, but the S&amp;P 500 is currently on pace for its 11th record closing high this year. While we're just 29 trading days into the year, in the post-WWII period, 2020 already ranks as the 33rd highest number of record closing highs for the S&amp;P 500 in a given year (out of 76). What's even more notable, though, is that at the current pace the S&amp;P 500 would have 96 record closes this year, which would dwarf the total from every other year. For reference, the highest number of record closing highs in a given year was 77 in 1995, and there are only four other years (1961, 1964, 2014, and 2017) where there were more than 50 record closes.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021220-New-Highs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# US Continues to Gain Share of World Market Cap\n\n&gt; The United States dominates the rest of the world in terms of its share of total equity market capitalization. Currently, US stocks make up over 40% of global equities' total market cap. No other country comes even close to this size with the next largest country being China with just 8.47% and then Japan with 7.09%. Hong Kong is the only other individual county with a share larger than 5%. While France is the largest European Union country stock market in terms of the percentage of world market cap at only 3%, the total share of all EU countries shown sits at over 10%. Former EU member, the United Kingdon, is also one of the larger countries but has consistently lost share over the past decade. So far this year it has lost another 0.2%.\n\n&gt; One interesting change that we noted at the end of last year has been the massive increase in Saudi Arabia's share thanks to one of the world's largest companies, Saudi Aramco, hitting public markets. Although it has led to a massive jump over the long run, since the start of the year Saudi Arabia's share of market cap has fallen 14 bps likely due to Saudi Aramco being a one-way trade lower off of its highs that were put in place only a few days after its IPO. Meanwhile, the US has taken another 1.17% of the world's market cap in 2020 alone.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/World-Market-Cap2.png))**\n\n&gt; While there are several individual countries that are actually outperforming the US so far in 2020, generally speaking, the US has outperformed the rest of the world which is why the US has taken more market cap this year. Whereas the S&amp;P 500 was up 3.93% YTD as of yesterday's close, MSCI's World Index excluding the US is just about flat. That trend of US outperformance has been in place for much of the past year well before the coronavirus hit Asia in December.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/RS-ROW.png))**\n\n&gt; Another interesting country to note is China. 2020 has been off to a rocky start thanks to the coronavirus. This had sent the country's share of global market cap plummeting down to ~8% on February 3rd. That was its lowest level since February of last year. But as this month has progressed and the situation surrounding the virus has improved, China has regained some of those losses and is now sitting with a larger share of world market cap than it ended 2019 with.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/China-Percent.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Things Are Looking Up\n\n&gt; Stocks had their best week in 8 months last week, as the worst of the coronavirus fears subsided and the US economy showed some impressive resolve. Last, the LPL Strategists discuss why international stocks could finally be close to having their time in the sun after lagging the US for much of the past decade.\n\n&gt; # DEVELOPED MARKETS ARE LOOKING BETTER\n&gt; Developed markets have lagged the US for more than 10 years now. Although we aren\u2019t ready to fully invest in these areas, we are starting to see signs to warm up to international equites. As the LPL Strategists discuss, values are historically cheap relative to the US, global growth is stabilizing, growth leadership my start to weaken, and the US dollar should be pressured lower. Should any of those four reasons begin to take place, it could create a nice tailwind for international stocks.\n\n&gt; # THE LATEST ON THE CORONAVIRUS\n&gt; Equity markets bounced nicely last week, as fears over the coronavirus appear to be calming. The loss of lives is devastating, but markets are focusing on this fast spreading, yet low death rate of this virus versus other dangerous outbreaks. The LPL Strategists noted that China could very well see flat GDP growth in Q1, a big pick up later in 2020 could be likely. Additionally, don\u2019t forget that the US economy actually got stronger during the SARS outbreak in 2003.\n\n&gt; # SOME MORE GOOD NEWS\n&gt; Further supporting stocks last week was a trio of solid economic data in the US. The jobs report in January showed a very solid 225,000 jobs created, well above expectations. Additionally, much better than expected manufacturing data and solid services data show an economy that continues to defy the naysayers. Last, productivity in Q4 bounced and for the year it was the highest nonfarm productivity since 2010.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.lpl.com/content/dam/lpl-www/images/Article_Page/WMC_02102020_1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Another \"Delay\" in the Value Trade\n\n&gt; How many times over the last few years have you heard something to the tune of \"The time for value stocks to outperform is now.\" Well, we're still waiting. The chart below shows the relative strength of the S&amp;P 500 Value Index versus the S&amp;P 500 Growth Index going back to 1995. A quick warning: if you have a sensitive stomach you may want to skip the chart altogether.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021220-Value-vs-Growth.png))**\n\n&gt; From 1995 right up to the bull market peak in 2000, value stocks couldn't catch a break as they steadily underperformed growth stocks. Those were the days when Energy as a sector was 'dead' and investors couldn't get enough of tech IPOs with trendy sounding names. The low for value stocks on a relative basis came on 3/27/00, and from there the reversal was swift. By April of 2001, value stocks had regained nearly all of the ground they lost relative to growth during the late 1990s. Unfortunately for investors in both types of strategies, the outperformance in value wasn't the result of a monster rally, but instead a massive decline in growth stocks.\n\n&gt; From April 2001 through late 2002, value stocks underperformed again as the Worldcom and Enron accounting scandals cast a pall over sectors like Telecom Services and Utilities - two sectors traditionally comprised predominantly by value stocks. As the dust settled on those two scandals, though, and the economy stabilized, value stocks rallied again as Energy, Financials, and Materials stocks boomed.\n\n&gt; As the Financial sector began to unravel in 2007 and oil prices peaked in 2008, value stocks once again cratered relative to growth. Growth has maintained its lead over value ever since. Outside of some periods where value stocks briefly popped and strategist after strategist came out and said this time the rally is for real, growth stocks have left value stocks in the dust. Just last year, the underperformance of value stocks marked a major milestone as they took out their lows in relative strength versus growth stocks. While the S&amp;P 500 Value Index saw a modest bounce towards the end of last year, any momentum it had has quickly been erased in 2020 as the ratio between it and the S&amp;P 500 Growth index is now at fresh lows.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending February 14th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 2.16.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP2aL-EGRQg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$WMT** \n&gt; * **$MDT** \n&gt; * **$AAP** \n&gt; * **$DPZ** \n&gt; * **$ENPH** \n&gt; * **$INMD** \n&gt; * **$TRU** \n&gt; * **$WAB** \n&gt; * **$AEIS** \n&gt; * **$WING** \n&gt; * **$BHC** \n&gt; * **$VMC** \n&gt; * **$GRMN** \n&gt; * **$LDOS** \n&gt; * **$TSEM** \n&gt; * **$ECL** \n&gt; * **$ALLE** \n&gt; * **$GRPN** \n&gt; * **$CEVA** \n&gt; * **$OLED** \n&gt; * **$DBX** \n&gt; * **$NXRT** \n&gt; * **$BLMN** \n&gt; * **$ATH** \n&gt; * **$WIX** \n&gt; * **$FANG** \n&gt; * **$CEQP** \n&gt; * **$ADI** \n&gt; * **$FLR** \n&gt; * **$ZS** \n&gt; * **$VG** \n&gt; * **$SIX** \n&gt; * **$A** \n&gt; * **$CHH** \n&gt; * **$SEDG** \n&gt; * **$NVTA** \n&gt; * **$IMAX** \n&gt; * **$AG** \n&gt; * **$EXPD** \n&gt; * **$FSLR** \n&gt; * **$STNG** \n&gt; * **$AKS**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/j9w4IR8.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/siAY14P.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY 2020!](https://i.imgur.com/kpCRctt.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.17.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.
