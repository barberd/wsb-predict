{"id": "g0hw81", "title": "Personal Loans - the next bubble?", "selftext": "With the market 100% to go red this week and hit circuit breakers down the whole way, I decided to get a $50,000 personal loan to YOLO on DIS puts.\n\nWith nothing but some made up numbers and a credit score showing I pay my mountain of credit card bills on time, I was approved instantly. I got a lower rate by promising to pay at least half of it towards a credit card, but since I gave them a fake number they couldn\u2019t pay directly, so I get all the cash AND a lower rate. Not that it matters cause I\u2019ll pay it back when my puts print. \n\nHow could anything possibly go wrong by extending huge lines of credit to obviously over-leveraged individuals with absolutely no verification of underwriting information?  Like my puts, clearly these companies realize these loans literally can\u2019t go tits up. \n\n$90p 4/24 all of it.", "created_utc": 1586780397.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0hw81/personal_loans_the_next_bubble/", "is_self": true}
