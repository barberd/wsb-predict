{"id": "flbnig", "title": "3/20 Will Be Green", "selftext": "Yesterday, Trump was supposed to announce something big from the FDA. Many speculated that it related to increased test kits or initiating vaccine trials both of which are old news. And he did talk about them, but he never really gave the big FDA update that was initially touted. Even after speaking about the increased testing, the vaccine trials, and the hospital boat, Trump still alluded to something big with the FDA that will be released today. So what else could there be? According to the WSJ, it may have been that Trump wanted the FDA to approve demonstrated-safe treatments for COVID-19. \n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/trump-sought-to-expand-virus-drug-tests-over-fda-objections-11584545251\n\nOf course, the article says that the FDA pushed back on this, and maybe that\u2019s why we didn\u2019t get the FDA update yesterday. But we were still told that there would be a significant FDA development. Perhaps Trump just needed the extra time to clarify how his executive order defines the word \u201csafe\u201d. After all, he doesn\u2019t actually need the FDA\u2019s approval to issue an executive order. But he does care about patient safety, so he may have wanted to clarify on this point which the WSJ notes was contentious for the FDA.\n\nFurthermore, when asked about the FDA and potential treatments yesterday, Trump specifically said, \u201cWe are making a lot of progress therapeutically, and that\u2019s all I\u2019ll say.\u201d And then there\u2019s the following WH correspondent Tweet from yesterday related to his briefing today:\n\nhttps://mobile.twitter.com/weijia/status/1240456119270678530\n\nThere have been anecdotal reports of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine being effective in China and now in France. And the evidence from *in* *vitro* testing seems to support the anecdotes:\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41421-020-0156-0\n\nhttps://nypost.com/2020/03/19/old-malaria-drug-hydroxychloroquine-may-help-cure-coronavirus-study/\n\nChloroquine is too toxic, potentially, but hydroxychloroquine is not. The evidence even shows that it might be effective as a prophylactic. If much of our concern centers on lack of healthcare workers due to them catching the virus, maybe, just maybe, this solves that problem entirely. The lack of PPE supplies is still an issue, but the Defense Production Act will address that. Hydroxychloroquine is not in short supply due to its regular use for other conditions.\n\nI\u2019ve got evidence that TEVA supplies much of the HCQ in the US. And despite its relatively inexpensive production, a single course is over $100 even without a discount (that\u2019s without insurance). They\u2019re making big money on a generic. The reality is that any generic manufacturer (Mylan, Novartis, etc...) could be a good long call here and even non-generic manufactures that have their own treatments incoming (Pfizer, Regeneron, Gilead) (though safety might be an issue). TEVA announces their Q1 earnings at the end of April, and right now their options are dirt cheap. Furthermore, they are currently extremely undervalued.\n\nAll of this feeds investor sentiment, and I believe it gives us enough hope and vision to drive up markets overall. It is possible that this leads to a turning point. We still have the fallout of social isolation to cope with, so we\u2019ll still have red days and bears are safe, but this might give us a solid vision for recovery. China announced zero deaths yesterday. South Korea\u2019s mortality rate is very low. China said that the US should follow Korea\u2019s example. We\u2019re already socially isolating. Perhaps therapeutics (along with Defense Production) is the next step. \n\nTEVA 5/1 10-20c.", "created_utc": 1584630920.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flbnig/320_will_be_green/", "is_self": true}
