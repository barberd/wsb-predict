{"id": "eiund5", "title": "Vegas Math: How Does a Lady Gaga Residency Make Money for MGM?", "selftext": "I was recently looking up Lady Gaga tickets, and I was surprised to see how expensive they were. However, I was even more surprised to see how much she alone is getting paid for the residency. Apparently, she is signed a two-year $100 MM deal for 74 shows:\n\nhttps://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/lady-gaga-plots-las-vegas-residency-199241/\n\nTicket sales have been pulling in $1.41 MM - $1.48 MM per show. Even if we use the top end of that number and multiply it by the total number of shows, you get a number barely above $100 MM\n\n74 x $1.48 MM = $109.52 MM\n\nSo, that\u2019s less than $10 MM to cover all the other costs of 74 shows (including the marketing for it and what not). Even considering that most guests who go to the show will stay in a hotel (which may not may not even be an MGM property) and spend other money here, I don\u2019t see how this could possibly be making much money on a net basis. And unless Lady Gaga has enough clout to pull in people who would not otherwise come to Vegas (and I\u2019m too unaware of her current fan base to know if she does), people who go to this show and pay hundreds of dollars for tickets will likely just cut back on spending elsewhere on a Vegas trip. \n\nThis just seems like an interesting business problem. I\u2019m not sure how something like this could make money for MGM, but perhaps I\u2019m missing a key element or two and I can be enlightened by some of you people here. I\u2019m sure MGM would not spend this kind of cash if they didn\u2019t think it would make a good return, but I just don\u2019t see how these numbers could work in any meaningful way. \n\nCheers!", "created_utc": 1577946909, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eiund5/vegas_math_how_does_a_lady_gaga_residency_make/", "is_self": true}
