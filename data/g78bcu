People are buying webcams, mouses and keyboards more than ever... And PC gamers are buying the same cheap mouses and keyboards, albeit with twinkling green LED lights and extra useless buttons.\n\nLogitech has twice as much Google interest as they see in Christmas season, and they benefit from both Zoom meetings and teenagers playing Blizzard games. LOGI announces earnings on 5/11 and options are CHEAP right now, with 5/15 implied volatility at 46%. That would be a nightmare at any other time in history but it's a fucking steal in technologies during COVID. Compare that to HEAR (pump and dump) whose IV is 3x as high with a less impressive suite of relevant products and a narrower scope of applications.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bkxzjwv9nru41.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=93a8e051858a5d4495a467597783176f0dad8f54\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cc1vi3ysnru41.png?width=1149&format=png&auto=webp&s=053fa4530692f50049647865746c5a4775151e80\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hxjne0qunru41.png?width=1149&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1bbc82c9160ddbd5c465e78b4713f265988af13\n\nI'm all in on LOGI 5/15 60 calls.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: These are 5 YEAR charts by the way... The highest interest in 5 years.\n\nEDIT 2: If you think it's priced in, compare with EA, ATVI and ZM... Those are priced in.
