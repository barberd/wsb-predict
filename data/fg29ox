The owe nearly 30M in debt and a significant amount of cash flow comes from investments (about 3M).  They have barely churned profits the past few years compared to their market cap (their profit is a mere 2M compared to &gt;10B market cap).\n\nThey are based in Miami and if Coronavirus spreads there, they will receive virtually no revenue.  Their cruises are in international waters and with quarantines and the government advising against cruise adventures, it is only downhill from here.  With just a 20% drop in revenue, their balance sheet will be borderline bankrupt. \n\nTheir P/E ratio is 5.3, this will drop as other people on the street see this opportunity.  Most hedge funds are shorting CCL, and once CCL has reached its bottom, they will short RCL.  I'm saying jump on the train before it's too late.\n\nIf you don't believe me, today's volume is about 6x the average volume, which is NOTHING compared to other stocks right now.  So Im saying it's not too late.  \n\nI'm planning to buy a shitload of 48p expiring 3/20 at open tomorrow, these are priced hella cheap for what's about to come.", "created_utc": 1583789438, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fg29ox/shortbuy_puts_on_rcl_dd/", "is_self": true}
