On Saturday they exercised it, charging my account -$56k for the 1000 shares of TQQQ, massively overdrawing the account.\n\nMonday morning, I closed the position immediately after my 7:00am pre-market opened, at $40.25, realizing a loss of $15,750.\n\nToday they liquidated my positions (mostly TQQQ puts) at 11:24am and called me to inform me of my fucking. After liquidation and liquidation fees, I am left with a $6k debt saved up for retirement. That's not a bad start, right?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j6pdjvawh9n41.png?width=719&format=png&auto=webp&s=5baf36fb5a1c534857672dd5c3a8930dfaacf73f\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the Fs. To clarify why I didn't close the ITM options:\n\nI was feverishly trying to close the position, but it was all laggy and shit and not loading in the last few minutes (big surprise), so I had trouble closing the position. I had several other calls, TQQQ $52, $53, $54, $55 that I closed, but I wasn't able to get the last one in time. Didn't think they would turbo fuck me like this for leaving money on the table.\n\nKicker is I only paid $8 per contract, so they ended up putting me on $56k exposure of a triple leveraged instrument over an $80 long call option. The realized losses I incurred were -18400%\n\nEdit2: To prevent this from happening to you, if you ever find yourself with some options that have expired in the money, CALL YOUR BROKER. Tell them \"Do Not Exercise\" this options contract. If you do not place a DNE on the option, it will be auto-exercised by the Chicago people. Usually, brokers have enough people on staff to make sure the ITM options expiring have sufficient capital to back them up, but they were too busy to deal with my account on Saturday.
