Meanwhile Kathy, the clerk at the Denny's in Little Rock, Arkansas, is going to just find workouts on Youtube now that Planet Fitness is closed. \n\n* Even the people who have the bikes can't use them.

Problem is: NO ONE WILL WANT TO RIDE A BIKE IN THEIR HOUSE AFTER THIS! THEY WILL GO FUCKING OUTSIDE.\n\n**$PTON 24p 5/15**", "created_utc": 1586802063.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0oipx/this_pton_shit_has_got_to_stop/", "is_self": true}
