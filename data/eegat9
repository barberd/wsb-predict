{"id": "eegat9", "title": "Why in the hell Would people buy options?", "selftext": "Im still a beginner about this stuff so correct me if in wrong\n\nOptions is kinda like stocks but you lose ALL your money if expiration date hits and your predictions was wrong right? \n\nWhy would anyone add such risk of losing all your money? If you buy stocks, there is no expiration date and you cant lose all of your money? Can anyone explain ? There must be some benefit to options?\n\nSay i have $100 and i do a call option on google that expires next year, i am confident that google will rise at least 10% before my expiration date, \n\nSooo... if google is up 10% , ill sel my options and get a 10% profit? Is that how it works?\n\nAnd can someone explain to me why that one guy that did a $50,000 put on apple stock that expire the next day,? Does that like multiply his earnings if he's right? \n\nLets say i have $1000 and google is releasing its earnings tomorrow, and im confident it will beat its earnings, so i do a call option of 1000 that expire the next day, lets say google went up 5% the next day, how much would i get?\n\n\nTLDR : \n1. What is the benefit of buying an option? Its just like a stock with an expiration date , so why add the risk of losing all your money? Can you multiply your gain/loss or something?\n\n2 why would anyone buy an option that expires the next day, what is the benefit? Why bot just buy option that expires in a year to be safe? But then again, why buy options in the first place? Its like stocks but with more risk but same reward.... right?", "created_utc": 1577079593, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eegat9/why_in_the_hell_would_people_buy_options/", "is_self": true}
