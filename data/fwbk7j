Forget TA, let's just look at this shit like autists.\n\nClearly there's an attack on Bears as the Trump administration & other parties go down the list below to create a Bull case to restore confidence (*manipulate markets*), even if it's illusory. Anyone entering a short position in the near-term will have to fully understand that for their Put options/shorts to pay out, this collective 'news' attack (by the Fed, Trump administration, & any other party with aligned interest) on Bears will ultimately fail. \n\nOn Thursday last week, unemployment numbers were met with an oil tweet by Trump. Today, oil price plummeting was met with Cuomo on live television saying this 'could' be visualization of the top of the curve. This is the type of shit that's going to continue happening until these people have either 1) secured a net position that is aligned w/ reality or 2) the bad news swamps the media they control in which they're still ok cus they've bought themselves time to minimize their losses.  \n\nSo, the question to ask isn't whether do we, the bear gang, see through this bs, the most important question is **does the market & will the market** (before option expiry)? What *can't* the market ignore?\n\nBear:\n\n\\- Ongoing COVID news that detracts from trends\n\n\\- Unemployment\n\n\\- Global COVID news\n\n\\- CARES Act stumbles (looks like they're having issues with the SBA getting loans processed, could be [healthcare.gov](https://healthcare.gov) v2)\n\n\\- Oil Price War\n\n\\- Ongoing liquidity issues in Fixed Income\n\n\\- Recent addition: Fed doing some type of funding to resolve market 'plumbing' issues (lol)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBull:\n\n\\- COVID Testing improvements\n\n\\- COVID Vaccine timing\n\n\\- Oil Price War\n\n\\- CARES Act milestones\n\n\\- Additional Fiscal stimulus\n\n\\- COVID cases/deaths bucking the trend \n\n\\- Unemployment as temporary\n\n\\- China/Korea going back to normal (even though the US is on an entirely different trajectory)\n\n\\-------------\n\nAnything I'm missing? \n\nI have 5/15 Puts on several single names (look at post history)", "created_utc": 1586223631.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fwbk7j/discussion_on_news_how_do_bears_win/", "is_self": true}
