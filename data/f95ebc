{"id": "f95ebc", "title": "Weather the Coronavirus with $DFS", "selftext": "$DFS, Discover Financial Services, is a great buy right now. No China exposure because their business is based in the USA babyyyy (it\u2019s like Wendy\u2019s but without the shitty breakfast offerings) and it\u2019s trading closeish to a 52 week low and the CEO and other insiders recently bought a fuckton of stock in it.\n\n1) Super cheap when compared to its competitors - it has a 8.3 P/E vs 16.5 P/E competitor American Express, higher ROIC, higher margins, better underlying business but is still cheaper? That\u2019s better than a boiling bowl of bat soup \ud83e\udd87\ud83e\udd63 \n2) The stock dipped over 10% last month because they announced that 2020 revenue would be down because of higher operating expenses BUT they are investing in technology which they need to be successful in the long term, so I don\u2019t see this as a negative and will pay off in the next few years \n3) Weathered the 2008 financial crisis very well - while the S&amp;P was down 30%, $DFS only dipped 2.8%. Will weather any shortterm downturn easy peasy. You literally can\u2019t go tits up. \n4) $DFS makes 60% of revenue off of interest payments, this will continue as Americans (especially brokeass millennials living in their parents basement with $43 in RH) just keep borrowing and borrowing more and get swamped in debt \n\nThis is not a short term play or a meme stock, I\u2019m buying 10/16 $82.50 calls, don\u2019t be autistic and load up on 2/28 or anything, but over the long term, $DFS is a tendies printing machine and you can get it at a discount!\n\nSay no to the \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b and say yes to DFS \ud83c\udf4a", "created_utc": 1582608775, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f95ebc/weather_the_coronavirus_with_dfs/", "is_self": true}
