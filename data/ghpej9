{"id": "ghpej9", "title": "Ultimate retard play DD ($TME)", "selftext": "Okay tards, this is almost a completely retarded YOLO but it is dirt cheap so I\u2019m playing it.\n\nMeet Tencent Music ($TME) \u2013 the Chinese twin of Sportify. It now has 644 million users and the number of paying users has increased by 47.8% YoY as of end of 2019. The company has been on a contract making spree with major music labels all over the world and has done very well. These guys have contracts with Sony Music, Warner Music and other major industry players.\n\n* Across the course of calendar 2019, according to MBW\u2019s calculations, TME generated $514m from paying online music subscribers, and $1.03bn in terms of total online music revenues \u2013 including streaming plus downloads;\n\n* TME\u2019s paying music users figure in Q4 2019 (39.9m) was up 47.8% year-on-year, and up by 4.5m on the prior quarter (Q3 2019, see chart below). For comparison, Spotify\u2019s subscriber number at the end of the same period (Q4 2019) was 124m, up by 11m on the prior quarter;\n\n* TME\u2019s revenues from online music subscribers ($160m) in Q4 2019 was up 60.1% year-on-year;\n\n* TME\u2019s monthly ARPPU (Average Revenue Per Paying User) in terms of online music stood at 9.3 RMB (approximately $1.33) in Q4 2019 \u2013 an 8.1% improvement on the equivalent figure from Q4 2018.\n\nWith the lockdown, they have been gaining more paying users so there is a chance it blows the lid off this quarter. Again, this is a retarded play but it is so cheap with the big upside potential that I\u2019d regret not taking the chance. TO VALHALLA! Not drawing any correlations but Spotify is traded at 150 and this baby is only 11.  \n\n**there is volume on 5/15 11 and 12; 6/19 11 and 13.", "created_utc": 1589210021.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghpej9/ultimate_retard_play_dd_tme/", "is_self": true}
