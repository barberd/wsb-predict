My wife has been noticing my constant agitations and has refused to let me watch her getting it on with the bf, she claimed my demeanor dampen their moods.  I ain't got time for her nonsense right now, only Sue BAE and the WSB's autists can save me.  I must find a way to mobilize the un-vaccinated and harness their power against the institution.  My losses have caused my sugar-babies to cut back on their spending and cut my benefits off.  I have resorted to seeking Dirty Mike and the Boys for reach-arounds.  \n\nI had hoped this beer virus would caused a sale on Corona, but sadly it didn't so I resorted to chugging sweet tea after street racings in my Civic Del-Slow.  No fat chicks allow or gay bears, bulls only.\n\nAMD to $69 and TSLA to $1,000.
