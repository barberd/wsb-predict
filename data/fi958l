As we all know, orang man did us all a solid and assured us that the stonks are good. Since the trumpalump himself gave us all a tip-top analysis of the situation, we can rest assured that everything is okay. I will be washing my hands using the tears of the bears because this boi is going to the moon. \n\nAs you can see in the chart below, which I did very detailed technical analysis, there is going to be a massive spike. Nearly every single point on the screen is pointing at a near 45-degree angle upwards, tis should be proof enough that we are looking for SPY at the following:\n\n\\- SPY $300c 3/20\n\n\\- SPY $400c 3/22\n\n\\- DIS $275c 3/15\n\nTLDR: Stong good, go up. Tendie for many friend. SPYDER go boom\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Science Shit.
