I'm a lonely beta cuck. 6'4 handsome beard of a god, active as fuck- gym, rock climbing, tea parties. and still single if there's any ladies here. but nightly, i'll buy a boost because fuck it its only the cost of a chipotle burrito and i'm thirsty for a date. i can proudly admit i've never succumbed to the super boost for $40 because that's a scam. and since i pay for the gold standard on top of the nightly 6.99 renewal, i get to see how many stomach rolls unfurl for me. 50% of them will be fake bots that disappear within 30min. 25% will be cute seemingly real profiles that say \"i like apples and bananas\" and those last throughout the night but disappear in the morning, unless you message them first-- then they stay as a match but just ignore you. the other 25% let their toddlers swipe for them.\n\nNow, I used to think... I was just pathetic and ugly as fuck and actually wanted to off myself over all this(still do). But then it dawned on me after a lot of the girls at work starting flirting with me after going to the gym for 3 months... MTCH was cherry picking inactive accounts for photos and copying them(and/or creating their own) in a different location. i don't know about you but, not too many women i know consent to their their photos being used without their instagram likes getting the recognition it deserves. so i'd imagine its a hellstorm at their corporate offices right now, burning the midnight oil, while shredding any incriminating evidence.\n\ntwo things will come from this: they will be found guilty and i might get a free boost out of it. or they will be found guilty and i'll die alone", "created_utc": 1570038511, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dcdp3r/mtch_is_going_to_be_so_fucked_from_their_doj/", "is_self": true}
