{"id": "f5i1vd", "title": "SDC Short Squeeze..? Earnings 2/25 AH, details inside.", "selftext": "I watch SDC and a few other volatile stocks that often receive bad press. These companies usually have a ton of short interest. They get a lot of bad press going into earnings. Sometimes, the right conditions make for a decent bet, which is why I watch them in the first place. \n\nTake SDC. Here's the setup. Earnings are on Tuesday 2/25. \n\n1) The stock rallied last week, and found $15 on Thursday for the first time since IPO.\n\n1a) (Call the hounds)\n\n2) NBC runs a BIG, nasty piece on SDC on Thursday night. Shares plummet 16% or so through Friday, tracing back to original support at/around $13 bucks. \n\n1b) Looking back... It elevated off of that $13 support on 4 November, for what reason I cannot tell other than tracking SPY and earnings buzz (and lack of bad press).\n\n2b) Now it's down 16% on NBC news a week and a day before earnings. All 16% of that selloff was based on sentiment changing. Before that, SDC had generated enough interest from both longs (to drive it to 15+) and shorts (now at ~50% float) to make this spicy. The news selloff 1 week before earnings makes this a nail biter. \n\nXYZ) IF it beats on earnings, or they give great guidance (announcing a bunch of new stores), well you know the rest of the story. FYSA, the odds of that are lower than the odds of this selling sideways and down. This is something I will personally watching early this week. This is NOT advice to do anything but pay attention and learn how bad-behavior stocks work.
