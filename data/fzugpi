{"id": "fzugpi", "title": "QQQ open interest following market close on 4/9", "selftext": "For anyone curious, here's a map of options on QQQ with color intensity indicating open interest relative to other contracts. Green/top-left is for calls, red/bottom-right is for puts. White just means that open interest is too insignificant for color to be visible. By far, the most popular open contract is 6/19 P @ $133 with 105K open interest, exceeding the second most popular by over 25%; I have no idea why. 6/19 seems pretty popular for puts, and across the board, strikes at $5 increments are very common ($190, $195, $200, $205, $210, etc). Calls are pretty spread out in intensity, as if people are just fucking guessing, but I guess that has been working for the past couple weeks. A lot of them have matching put intensity as well ($210-$230 4/17-6/19, that whole area). Totals are:\n\nputs: 4,209,537 open interest, 5,340,904,792 delta, 80,983,072 gamma, theta 851,437,791  \ncalls: 2,610,477 open interest, 3,955,146,755 delta, 47,944,020 gamma, theta 269,106,242\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yakx5ay2zcs41.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ac7bb45385702f45449d83848002fa335a42e62", "created_utc": 1586687483.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fzugpi/qqq_open_interest_following_market_close_on_49/", "is_self": true}
