Their debt/equity ratio is 0/4.49B. They consistently beat earnings with an ROE of 30% and a PE ratio of  6.13. They have insane financials, small overhead and an average of 20% increase in revenue and gross profit every year. Fundamentals don't matter until they do but I don't know shit... So I'm going to play earnings  6/9. Only con I see is volume. I am not an expert, in no way is this advice more so just what I saw as a good investment.\n\n 58.com Inc. operates online marketplace serving local merchants and consumers in China.
