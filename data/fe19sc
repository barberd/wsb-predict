Grandmas are going to die at a greater pace on the coming weeks/months, decimating $BIG\u2019s consumer base.\n\nI recommend buying April/May dated puts and watching the tendies (and grannies) fall. I\u2019m buying more tomorrow when inevitably they fall again because the market is fucking wild.", "created_utc": 1583439284, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fe19sc/big_puts_revisited/", "is_self": true}
