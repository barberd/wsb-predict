From Jan 2016 to Feb 2020, DJ made +75%. DAX only made 36%. Since the crisis started, they went pretty parallel.\n\nb) Coronavirus is gonna hit the US economy way harder than any other country in the western world. No social security. Corrupt healthcare system. Housing crisis upcoming. Trump may be willing to sacrifice a quarter of elderly people thinking they are a burden; totally ignoring that people are not willing to do that and also ignoring the collaps that comes with it. Think of all the consumers vanishing.\n\nc) When shit is over, German economy will return at maximum capacity.\n\nI made dripping tendies on corona but now volatility is so high it would be jackshit to go on after my current putsand the 3rd degree circuit breaker on monday. I'm looking for the next product to make real tendies on. I need a product that is at low volatility and will fucking explode when terrible tuesday hits later this year.\n\nIs there a financial product that I can buy or better call that represents inflation-adjusted ratio of DAX and Dow Jones?\n\nIs there a financial product that I can buy or better call that compares German economic growth/decline to US economic decline?\n\nFuck currencies. Fuck precious metals. Fuck bonds. I want products that directly compare and are not distracted by shit.", "created_utc": 1585449124.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqy52o/can_i_call_on_daxdow_jones_ratio/", "is_self": true}
