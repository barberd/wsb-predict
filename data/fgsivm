They've also cited that the coronavirus will not affect their work. \nhttps://www.tsmc.com/tsmcdotcom/PRListingNewsAction.do?action=detail&newsid=THGOPGPGTH\n \nXiaomi one of TSMC's largest customers has cancelled orders from them because they don't have the demand for their smartphones.\nhttps://www.digitimes.com/news/a20200226VL200.html\n\nHauwei, Apple, AMD, and Nvidia  (from what we know) haven't cancelled any orders or their revunue for February would have been terrible. Most of the Chinese firms were offline during the time so they likely cut orders when they were unable to work which is likely why it wasn't higher. \n\nLogically speaking, from this we can understand why Apple didn't ship as many phones to China even though they have been stockpiling chips from TSMC, they've been unable to get parts from Foxconn which will be online again in late March. \n\nhttps://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-03-10/chinas-smartphone-shipments-nosedive-more-than-50-in-february-101526430.html\n\nThen from what we can also gather is that TSMC will finally be able to mass produce 5nm chips for Apple's and Hauwei's 5g plans by the end of quarter 1 to early quarter 2. Apple is also planning on unveiling a cheap iPhone 9 which will likely a huge success like the 5c. \n\nAMD forsees 20% revunue growth this year. It is likely due to their new work with government which will be also run on TSMC chips. Nvidia will blow further higher with it's data center especially after such strong growth from last year, it's obvious to see why. \n\nIntel has given up even making their own chips to compete with TSMC.\n\nhttps://appuals.com/intel-xe-gpu-flagship-tsmcs-6nm/\n\nWhat does this have to do with anything? Well, strong consumer growth. And you're like even with the coronavirus running around stopping people from going outside? \n\nYes, this is because it seems to be a seasonal thing:\n\nhttps://www.techtimes.com/articles/247916/20200310/new-study-finds-warm-temperatures-could-kill-coronavirus-is-trump-right-in-saying-covid-19-will-subside-in-spring.htm\n\nHotter temperatures is a reality especially because of global warming, the Earth is hotter than it has ever been in recorded history. Because of that we will see a return to successful sales. As Apple begins to be able to stockpile and carry the economy forward. \n\nGDP will take a huge, and I mean huge hit this quarter. This is just from rational deduction. Boeing didn't get a single plane order in January. Boeing makes up a huge part of America's GDP. Supply shock likely hit hard in February. Simply from news going around, about how China had terrible output. \n\nFurthermore, oil clashes between Russia and the Saudis hurt the Saudis far more. Saudi economy is like 80% oil or something crazy like that. They cant afford to sell cheap for too long as Russia is like 30% oil. Meaning that Saudis will likely come back to negotiation table much sooner than we'd suspect. And because they'd rather not take the blame for the affect on the economy, they will likely move to a deal.\n\nAfter this news people go into a selling frenzy and the stock market will be ripe for the picking. Then we'll be able to snatch up nice and cheap tech stocks that will ultimately cause 2nd quarter GDP to rise. Increasing our tendy count. With this news of 1st quarter GDP lose, we will be seeing people flee not realizing that the panic scare is over as likely by then the 737 max will be up and running again and things will be looking to better times.\n\nSo what I'm saying is to hedge against the economy until the terrible GDP report than to sell and buy calls for Boeing, TSM, Apple, AMD, NVDA(essentially any tech stock). Because we'll be heading back into better days.", "created_utc": 1583906455.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fgsivm/signs_that_apple_and_amd_may_be_stockpiling_right/", "is_self": true}
