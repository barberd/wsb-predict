{"id": "ftpk2x", "title": "$PLAY with me ;)", "selftext": "This DD will focus on the company known as $PLAY or Dave & (going) BUSTers\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEarnings are AH April 2nd (that is today).\n\nThis stock traded as low as $4 two weeks ago before they poison pilled so those $6p that you can pick up for like $40/contract had an intrinsic value of $200. Obviously since we are all retards here I should remind you that that past performance future performance blah blah blah.\n\nFirst: Poison Pill [(Form 8-K)](http://ir.daveandbusters.com/sec-filings/sec-filing/8-k/0001104659-20-035620) All you really need to know about this is that it effectively prevents takeovers/acquisitions. Why is this important? Because, even though most M&A activity is suspended currently, acquisitions usually mean an immediate 25% - 40% premium to whatever the current trading price is. No risk of acquisitions means this company may be long term (like 3+ months out) screwed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow on to the [10-Q](http://ir.daveandbusters.com/sec-filings/sec-filing/10-q/0001193125-19-310318) (for the stoolies out there: This is like a 10-K, but filed Quarterly)\n\nThe 10-Q is from last December and presents the company as they were on November 2nd.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Lets look quickly over some fun facts:**\n\nPLAY had \\~20mm cash on hand last November.\n\nThey had 32mm in inventories.\n\nThey also had drawn down on their revolver to 82% utilized. (656mm out of 800mm)\n\nThey have a few location openings this year (expected first half 2020) that they will have to take possession and have lease obligations on (which are noted that some of these upcoming obligations were left out of this 10-Q as they had not yet, last December, taken possession of the properties).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Leases and other Liabilities:**\n\nWhat we know about their leases of which they had accrued liabilities of 44.6mm in November, is found in page 13:\n\n>We currently lease the building or site for our stores, corporate office and warehouse space under facility operating leases. **These leases typically have initial terms ranging from ten to twenty years** and include one or more options to renew. When determining the lease term, we include option periods for which renewal is reasonably certain. **Most of the leases require us to pay property taxes, insurance and maintenance of the leased assets.**\n\nWhat does this mean? It means that PLAY had as at last November **twice as much accrued lease liabilities** (rent it had incurred, but still needs to pay) as it had cash on hand.\n\nWhat else can we learn about PLAY's leases?\n\nEnding November 3rd PLAY had lease expenses of 31.5mm for the quarter and 91.7mm for the 39 weeks ending November 3rd.\n\nThis means PLAY has lease expenses of roughly 10mm per month.\n\nNow all this is great, but why are you telling us Johnny?\n\nWell because you may have heard that you should be staying the F\\*K INSIDE! Which means....Dave & Busters isn't getting any of that sweet sweet cash you have saved up!\n\nWhat else do we know about PLAY?\n\nWell, they have been trying to grow themselves out of decreased revenues. How does this work?\n\nNew locations have honeymoon cash flows. Old locations generally have 2.5% to 4% decrease in revenues for every year they are open. So PLAY was opening a bunch of new locations first half 2020 which they had taken possession of along with other locations they had not yet taken possession of.\n\nSo they open new locations in an effort to show \"growth\" and cover the declining revenues from older locations. Unfortunately, this means that PLAY also incurs pre-opening costs of roughly 4mm/qtr as they open all these new locations.\n\nTo do this they, like many other companies as (and please critique me on my retarded reading skills of financial statements) the blanketbois  [u/fuzzyblankeet](https://new.reddit.com/u/fuzzyblankeet/)  and  [u/KrusteeBlanket](https://new.reddit.com/user/KrusteeBlanket/) have pointed out, used debt to finance these expansions.\n\nIt also means PLAY now has to pay a\n\n>\"weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings\" of \"4.03% \".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso of note in this section is this statement:\n\n>\" Our credit facility contains restrictive covenants that, among other things, place certain limitations on our ability to: incur additional indebtedness, make loans or advances to subsidiaries and other entities, pay dividends, acquire other businesses or sell assets. In addition, our credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratio covenants \"\n\nwhich, as u/fuzzyblankeet has pointed out previously, means these guys are kinda stuck when it comes to responding to market changes. And **they wrote this note about restrictions an incurring additional debt back in December when their market cap was $1,200mm, 4x higher than the 300mm it is today.**\n\nPLAY was paying interest per qtr of 6mm on these credit facilities.\n\nWe also find that PLAY, outside of operating expenses and payroll (the expenses incurred paying employees and running their customer facing locations) has G&A expenses (page 4) of 16mm per quarter. While when store close down we can cut operating expenses, G&A expenses cannot be cut as easily.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy have I mentioned all these items relating to payments?\n\nwell, because\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# CA$H I$ KING!!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSummary:\n\nPLAY has a bunch of cash outflows that they are obligated to meet coming up.\n\nTheir revenue is essentially dropping to near $0 for the time being. They are sitting on a bunch of inventory which is mainly alcohol and food fro which they can't really convert to cash because they are usually not licensed to serve alcohol/food for off-premises consumption so that 30mm in inventories is probably more like 15mm when cash comes to crunch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven if PLAY cut all their operating expenses to $0 they still have have a bunch of obligatory cash outflows that are ongoing, limited revolver left to draw on, very low cash reserves, and inventory that will be exceedingly difficult to convert to cash.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn top of this: they made it so they can't really get bought out buy some other firm willing to snap up a company with a market cap of 317mm and debts of (this is pre-China Virus remember) 656mm.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow for the qualitative side:\n\nPLAY notes\n\n>The Company is currently a defendant in several **lawsuits filed in courts in California** alleging violations of California Business and Professions Code, industry wage orders, wage-and-hour laws and rules and regulations pertaining primarily to the failure to pay proper regular and overtime wages, failure to pay for missed meals and rest periods, pay stub violations, failure to pay all wages due at the time of termination and other employment related claims (the \u201cCalifornia Cases\u201d). Some of the California Cases purport or may be determined to be class actions or Private Attorneys General Act representative actions and seek substantial damages and penalties. With respect to these California Cases, where the Company has determined that a loss is reasonably possible but not probable, **the Company is unable to estimate the amount or range of the reasonably possible loss** due to the inherent difficulties of predicting the outcome of uncertainties regarding legal proceedings\n\nNow I had a friend who worked for a competitor to PLAY back when I was in college (a few years ago now) and I know a few people who have worked in and currently work in the \"hospitality\" industry (unfortunately, no strippers). If PLAY is anything like their competition and similar to any other restaurant: they will be settling or paying out on these lawsuits in California. I can almost guarantee that 80% of the paystubs they issued were incorrect, they almost 100% never paid out correctly on termination, and they 100% have violated overtime and mandated rest period rules.\n\nIcing on the cake: Everyone who is anyone knows that companies that report EBITDA are more shady than the dark side of the moon. Why? because you can fiddle and diddle EBITDA more than Epstein can underage girls on an island to make it say whatever you want it to say. And PLAY provides EBITDA for us indicating they are a bit shady. But not only do they provide it in an effort to make themselves look good, but **compared to the year before their EBITDA for the quarter declined by 13.5% from the previous year (46mm to 39.8mm)!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, what you do with your money is up to you. A company this autistic in a market like this could default tomorrow and the stock would climb 300%, who knows. Nothing in this post should indicate I am suggesting any trade one way or another.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will disclose positions (~~having trouble uploading images currently~~ [Positions](https://imgur.com/oaAChfI)):\n\nall for PLAY:\n\n04/09 14p x 2\n\n&#x200B;\n\n04/17 5p x 8\n\n&#x200B;\n\n04/17 6p x 10\n\n&#x200B;\n\n04/17 15c x 2\n\n&#x200B;\n\n05/15 10p x 2\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet me know what you think in the comments below.

This may indicate looking for options that are monthlies/quarterlies, rather than FDs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the other hand, FDs are cheaper and have more upside (and downside) so YOLO to your personal risk tolerance.", "created_utc": 1585845485.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ftpk2x/play_with_me/", "is_self": true}
