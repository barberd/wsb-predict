{"id": "g51gdq", "title": "PLEASE stop betting against THETA", "selftext": "If your positions allow you to double your portfolio or more in a day, you're probably also asking for Miss Theta to peg you while she raids your wallet.\n\nIf you are a new investor, DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT buy naked options. You may double, hell, triple your money, but you WILL lose eventually. You will not cash out before this happens because you are addicted to short term gains. Just fucking stop. You won't be making massive daily gains anymore but your 1 month or 3 month chart might actually be green for once.\n\nYou don't have to do covered calls and puts and go full theta gang. Do use spreads and other multiple option orders. Vertical spreads, diagonal spreads, strangles, calendar straddles, broken butterflies, godzillas, whatever. Each one of these has its own purpose but if you use them right it can be very profitable. Currently I'm having tremendous success trading calendar straddles and basically making free money.\n\nI know what you're thinking. \"B-b-but that would mean doing some boring research! It's so much easier to buy random options with no DD and pray that IV stays high enough to keep the theta toilet from flushing my tendies into the sewer\".\n\nListen, how much fucking money do you make at your job? If you can spend an hour making $15, you can spend an hour learning how to save $1500. Be a responsible gambler, not a degenerate gambler.", "created_utc": 1587417280.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g51gdq/please_stop_betting_against_theta/", "is_self": true}
