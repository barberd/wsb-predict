So I've been watching MDT for a while now, and have noticed a pattern that I am now going to attempt to profit off of.  Its share price has been hovering between about $92-$102 since recovering from the COVID crash, but it always seems to meet resistance around $100.  It's had multiple instances of getting over that hump, but then immediately drops below it within the next day or two.  Reversely, when it has been in the mid to low $90 range, it always manages to sneak its way back up to get close to or surpass the $100 mark.  I don't know squat about fundamentals, trends, or the market, and I'm not going to pretend like I know the reasoning behind this suspected pattern, but I do know this:\n\n* I'm typing this garbage from the hospital that I work at where our patient volume has doubled over the past two weeks because our state is reopening.  This means that elective surgeries are back on the menu and people who were discouraged to come into hospitals during quarantine are starting to seek treatment. Meaning that the need for medical equipment should start to rise as patient volumes increase across hospital systems.\n*  Medtronic is the world's largest medical device company.  They make seemingly everything potentially needed for patient care.  Surgical equipment, pacemakers, gauze, bandages, insulin pumps, implants (not those kind you degen), stents, ventilators, catheters, imaging systems, etc.  If you've seen it in a hospital or on Scrubs, they probably make it.\n* Although there has been a large increase in the need for ventilators world wide due to COVID-19, most of Medtronic's revenue doesn't even come from vent sales.  In 2019, only about $2.7 billion of their $30+ billion of revenue came from the division (Respiratory, Gastrointestinal, & Renal) that's responsible for ventilators.  This means that regardless of ventilator sales, Medtronic should see plenty of money flowing their way for the plethora of other medical devices and equipment they produce.\n* Because MDT was down literally every day this week after starting at $99.45 on Monday (again with that $100 resistance), calls are hella cheap.  At one point yesterday, a 6/5 100c option was trading at $0.28. They started the day at $0.43 and ended the day worth $0.53, so still super cheap. I got in Friday morning, but don't think it's too late come next week to make some tendies as the share price inevitably teases the $100 point as it always does.\n\nMost importantly, my friend has an entry level position at Medtronic and is mediocre at his job at best.  Get bent Brandon.\n\n[Positions](https://imgur.com/YFVvzft)", "created_utc": 1590247010.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gp6mf1/buy_the_medtronic_mdt_dip/", "is_self": true}
