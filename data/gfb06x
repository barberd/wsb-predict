{"id": "gfb06x", "title": "$SDC Tendies May Put A Smile On Your Face!", "selftext": "TLDR and position at bottom\n\n**The Company:**\n\nSDC is a telehealth company primarily offering dental products like aligners (think invisalign).  There are two ways of using SDC: 1) go to a Smile Shop (several locations internationally) and see a doctor for an initial check-up and get pics of your mouth taken for a 3D model or 2) DIY traditional impression kit from home (that pink algae stuff).\n\nRecently, Smile Shops have been closed until May 3rd due to COVID and SDC has moved to an all DIY impression kit model. (I'd actually like to see this be the primary model for the company moving forward as it reduces costs and is more aligned with the DIY trends). \n\n**Financial Position:** \n\nCurrently have $350m cash on hand, only $200m in total debt outstanding. The company also has a credit facility for up to $500m from JPM.  For a growing business with international exposure, the risks that this thing is going to disappear seem unlikely and the company is healthy enough to weather this storm. \n\n**Traction:**\n\nMain revenues are from financing (they offer 17% APR thru a program for paying for their product over a length of time, with the manufacturing costs due up front as deposit, so they never lose money here even with delinquency and this is damn near loan sharking, but only a minor part of total revenues) and from their aligners (which cost about 50% as much as traditional invisalign); together, gross margins are a nice \\~70%. I believe SDC already had a good business model. \n\nLast year's net loss was about $500m. Mainly due to increasing marketing and SGA costs to achieve growth and IPO. However, these things come at the expense of gaining new customers - and most important KPI for a growth company is their increase in product shipments and revenue growth, which grew 80% last year (plus SDC already has good margins and balance sheet). Why do I think these metrics are going to look even better? \n\nNow, in a time where health is becoming increasingly important, people are staying at home, consumer discretionary spending is limited due to recession, I believe the DIY at home product offering, available financing programming, and cheap alternative to traditional orthopedics is very attractive. Also, EOY 2019 SDC picked up Aetna and United Health to help provide coverage, plus another recent deal which shot up the stock 10% yesterday (insurance for dental health is difficult and these partnerships will expand consumer reach further).\n\nAdditionally, Teladoc has mooned to ATH while SDC has been left behind, trading at $7.50 vs $15 pre-COVID. Yet, rigorous DD on Google Trends shows they've been about equally popular in the past 90 days ( probably not directly comparable because Teladoc likely converts more customers from searches) : [Link](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%203-m&geo=US&q=Teladoc,Smile%20Direct%20Club) \n\n**The Bad:**\n\nThere exists significant media covering problems with the SDC products, but I dont think this is specific to just SDC, as there exists articles for aligners like invisalign in general. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:** Financial health looks like SDC will survive, has already good business model with nice margins and is growing revenue significantly, trading 50% off pre-covid high while Teladoc has mooned and I think covid issues will actually help the company's growth (DIY, cheap alternative, financing options).\n\n**Position:** $8c 5/22 (ER is 5/13)", "created_utc": 1588872532.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gfb06x/sdc_tendies_may_put_a_smile_on_your_face/", "is_self": true}
