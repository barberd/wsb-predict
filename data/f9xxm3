However, travel stocks should be taking a massive hit, which RCL currently is, because who the fuck wants to sit on some smelly-ass boat for a month? Aside from that, just get one person sick with corona on one of these things, and not only does it become a floating Petri dish, but it also gets docked for a long time to be deep cleaned, to (hopefully) eradicate the disease from the boat. This has already happened. Multiple times. They also had to cancel 30 cruises through Southeast Asia.\n\nLong story short, things look bad for $RCL, they\u2019re down 25% this week, it looks like it\u2019ll only get worse, and boats suck more dick than your mother and I combined.
