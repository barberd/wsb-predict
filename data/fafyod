I had one day trade left so I planned on just trying to ride 1 call from the dip.\n\nIt\u2019s since raised a bit and I sold the 780 to cover my initial, and the 765 is now at about 400%\n\nSo is it worth the risk of selling a 4th day trade at 400% profit that expires tomorrow? Or do I suck it up, be happy I didn\u2019t lose money to said glitch, and pray Tesla moons overnight?", "created_utc": 1582826170, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fafyod/rh_glitch_fucked_me_can_i_get_away_with_a_4th_day/", "is_self": true}
