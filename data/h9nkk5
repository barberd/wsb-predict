{"id": "h9nkk5", "title": "A few names I am buying", "selftext": "I believe that CAKE, LUV, RTX, and STZ are all undervalued. \n\nCAKE \n\nThis company makes more money per square foot than any company in their industry. People love them. They have excellent name recognition, and a hedge fund threw 200M in them back in April. PT $40-$45\n\nLUV\n\nProbably the best run airline. One of my favorite management teams, and flying will come back, because what do millennials value? Experiences, and how do you have experiences? Flying. This is the riskiest pick of the four and plenty of you are betting on airlines, but that\u2019s my two cents. PT $50-$55\n\nRTX\n\nWe are headed toward a very unstable period in history. War is an inevitability, and with the Utc merger this became a pure play on aerospace/defense. They have plenty of government contracts and diversified revenue streams. PT $85-$90\n\nSTZ \n\nPeople drink when they\u2019re happy. People drink when they\u2019re sad. If you want to know what to expect, look at Q4 of 2018 and the ensuing recovery for these guys.
