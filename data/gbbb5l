( I completely understand there are other factors affecting the stock values)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2009-2019 Tankers Dip**\n\nThrough the good times tankers began to be heavily produced due to the damn gains, which obviously lead to there being too many tankers which slumped tanker prices, since then banks have not being financing new tankers due to them bleeding cash etc and in the final quarter of 2019 we saw and increase in tanker fees. (in my head meaning the market had balanced for tankers to be profitable again but I agree this could just be an anomaly).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2020 Gain Train**\n\nThe stock was at $**4 in October 2019 from 10 million USD quarterly Revenue.** Share price is now at 6 USD and people call it overinflated etc? \n\nSO time for some quick maths:\n\nNAT are charging and average daily tanker rate of $72,000, they have 23 tankers at their disposal and there's a fucking oil glut going on.\n\nFrom those numbers they are set to make $99,360,000\u202c Every 60 days, **$600,000,000 Per Year NET PROFIT,** Divided by the 143 million shares in circulation that's an EPS of $4.2 for the year...\n\nThat is assuming the prices don't increase as the news is talking about average price being $100,000+ per day. \n\nFrom these numbers NAT is expected to have the best year they have ever had since the company opened by shittin $500,000,000\n\nREMEMBER: Corona-virus is going nowhere regardless of states coming out of lock-down (probably going to make things worse), there is no cure in the foreseeable 6 months, tanker prices will not change!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, where have I gone wrong here? this seems way too good to be true, or is it truly a once in a decade opportunity?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShare price will hit $50 in the next 8 months or I drink my own piss\n\nEdit: Net profit to avoid confusion with gross", "created_utc": 1588306273.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gbbb5l/hopefully_the_last_nat_post/", "is_self": true}
