To all the people who previously argued that MM are not looking at WSB options activity, let's look at the underlying truths.\n\n1. WSB is an incredible real time sentiment analysis that is composed of weaponized autism. e.g. careful examination of the daily thread, pre-boomer and before the r/all retard influx, enabled people to find consistent winning plays daily. \n2. As previously stated by others and myself, MM and large ETFs require delta/gamma hedging with increasing call options activity to mitigate short-term price movements. \n3. Taking 1 + 2 is a data scientist's wet dream. Imagine performing statistical analysis to map ticker/call strike + expiration, posting time, post frequency, to call option open interest. If you don't think quant shops like DE Shaw, Citadel, and RenTech aren't using different models/tools to measure WSB especially with all the new publicity in Bloomberg (the 400 post Microsoft was probably to obfuscate their scraping algorithm and hide their true collection numbers or they are just even more autistic than the people here), then I don't know what to say. \n\nAs previously stated by /u/theycallmeryan, FOIA requests have been sent to SEC to see if we are under investigation. Large players have been burned by this sub and don't want to see autistic monkeys outperform their best managers. All this publicity is not necessarily good. Times are changing for WSB. Stay frosty, protect your tendies. And fuck the MM.", "created_utc": 1582378613, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7sm10/ah_shit_here_we_go_again/", "is_self": true}
