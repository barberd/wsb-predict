{"id": "e49an2", "title": "Sell $BYND", "selftext": "Just got out of Burger King for some due diligence on $BYND.  I got the impossible whopper, the wife got the normal whopper. \n\nWhat I can say is that the normal whopper has more of a sleight sirloin/beef taste. (Go figure) Eating the impossible burger patty directly taste exactly like getting a Boca burger from the Walmart freezer. Both sandwiches were served near cold but what can you expect from the Fight for $15 crowd in central Washington. \n\nAt double the price and no better taste $BYND is over hyped and I value the company at sub $15 a share. They provide no added value and at a 5 billion plus valuation you have to be hitting the market order button on this stock because you either have $85 left in margin or your Stafford loan proceeds just hit your RH account. \n\nThe company will reach my target price I believe in the next year and a half or sooner. Feel free to set a reminder to confirm the prediction.  That way you can confirm your belief and join my cult following. #Crash2020", "created_utc": 1575170330, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e49an2/sell_bynd/", "is_self": true}
