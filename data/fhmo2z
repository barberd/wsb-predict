{"id": "fhmo2z", "title": "$WWE DD FOR YOU JABRONIES", "selftext": "Listen here window lickers. I know you saw me spamming $WWE since open and posting DD throughout the day and shit. But here is why you should hold or try to get in.\n\nWWE is currently trading at \\~32.30 I told people to buy when it was sitting at 38. 30 Strike 3/20 puts were a mere 25 cents a piece. Currently worth over 3 bucks.\n\nNow its not to late for these reasons:\n\n[Wrestlemania is the only large sporting event](https://twitter.com/WFLADaisy/status/1238163228921864192) that has yet to be cancelled.\n\n* 70,000 people are expected to pack the arena on April 5th in Tampa, Florida\n* A large amount of these people are Europeans who Trump literally just banned yesterday\n\nTampa executives [met today to discuss bans on \"large events\"](https://wrestlingnews.co/wwe-news/tampa-officials-to-hold-a-press-conference-today-to-determine-the-fate-of-large-events-in-the-city-like-wwe-wrestlemania/)\n\n* They gave WWE 1 week to decide what to do. It appeared they did not want to be the ones that pull the plug they want WWE to do it.\n* Should WWE fail to pull the plug, executives will meet again on 3/19 at 1:30EST to discuss what to do from there\n* Tampa already cancelled St Patrick Day parade and large conventions.\n* Tampa governor calls for [mass gatherings being held in the next 30 days to be postponed](https://www.pwtorch.com/site/2020/03/12/governor-of-florida-host-state-for-wrestlemania-says-mass-gatherings-scheduled-for-next-30-days-should-be-postponed-to-mitigate-coronavirus-spread/)\n\nWWE and the XFL is owned by McMahon \n\n* [XFL hosted Seattle games without fans](https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2020/03/11/xfl-announces-seattle-dragons-will-host-game-without-fans/). No fans no money. Other cities will follow. There might even be an outright cancellation of games\n\nFinally; WWE is literally 200 pound half naked men pretending to kill each other on a dirty mat.\n\n**TL;DR I'm currently holding 3/20 30P OR 4/17 25P if you got tendies.**\n\n*update: THE PRESSURE IS ON.
