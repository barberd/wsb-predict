{"id": "ew7tn6", "title": "Jay Z for BA and BB", "selftext": "I'm new to stocks, but I think I am on to something. I just heard a song from Jay Z and Linkin Park.  I think it is called Numb/Encore. At one point, Jay Z says the following:\n\n\"I'm in, Boeing jets, Global Express  \nOut the country but the Blueberry still connect\"\n\nIs it safe to say that Boeing and Blueberry will go up because of this? I'm thinking of taking a cash advance on my First Premier Bank credit card to afford one share of each. I keep reading about things being \"priced in\", but since this is a new song, it can't be, right?", "created_utc": 1580401079, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ew7tn6/jay_z_for_ba_and_bb/", "is_self": true}
