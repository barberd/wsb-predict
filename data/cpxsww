The company lowered guidance as adjusted EBITDA is expected to be \u201cat least $200M\u201d (vs. prior expectations of $235-250M) and said it expects organic net sales growth to come in the \u201clow single digits\u201d (vs. a prior forecast of +3-5%). Shares of CVET are trading at all-time lows this morning.

(X + $0.59 to $12.20)**\n\n**Notable Put Activity**\n\nSome unusual put activity (\\~39:1 over calls) is being seen in the **SPDR S&amp;P Regional Bank ETF (KRE + $0.79 to $50.94)** as all of the top 10 most actively traded contracts are puts. However, not all of the activity appears to be bearish in nature. The most actively traded contract is the January 2020 41.00 put (volume is 5,164 vs. open interest of 345) which mostly consisted of various sized blocks that were being sold at the bid price of $0.70. The activity suggests that the put sellers either believe that KRE will close at or above $41.00 (in which the premium received will be kept) or are comfortable taking a long position in the ETF at an effective purchase price of $40.30 in the even that KRE closes below $41.00 at expiration.\n\n**Volume Signals** \n\n**Mondelez International Inc.

The activity suggests that the put sellers either believe that NEM will close at or above $37.00 (in which the premium received will be kept) or are comfortable taking a long position in the stock in the event that NEM closes below $37.00 at expiration.\n\n**Gauging Volatility**\n\nThe **CBOE Volatility Index (VIX - 3.41 to 17.68)** has been on both sides of the unchanged line today (intraday range is 17.68-21.64) as equity markets are firmly higher across the board around the mid-day mark today (DJI + 440, SPX + 50, COMPX + 161).
