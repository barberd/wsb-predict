You're like that creepy fucking guy that wont leave the girl you dated for a week alone because you loved her and she broke your heart. I told you fuckers 1 month ago that the bull market was back, we were literally at the bottom of the crash and you idiots couldnt believe what I was saying. (Check my post history). I also piped in on discord before the oil crash and told you idiots you were fucking stupid and guess what happened? Oil went negative the next day.\n\nWhat dont you fucking retards get about what drop we saw was deleveraging and that it's not going to fucking go down again because people realize there isn't a need to sell off in an economic downturn anymore since seeing 2008 and all the others because stonks only go up. People know that it wont drop, it's like how you get numb to repetitive school shootings and nobody cares anymore. What has happened is a rotation of stocks and the shitty ones fail or will fail in time, this doesn't drop entire indices.\n\n Its 2020, we have technology intertwining markets now like never before as well as all of us being more connected than ever. The market isnt small business, its publicly traded companies that cant and shouldn't fail. In 1940 I would expect a complete crash because of the uncertainty due to no internet. Everything is certain now. Quit wasting your fucking money and buy calls.\n\nTldr: stonks only go up. Calls on everything.", "created_utc": 1587859751.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g84clm/dd_on_why_the_market_isnt_going_to_go_down_like/", "is_self": true}
