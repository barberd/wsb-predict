I live in Denver but 4.5 East, we have a property in farm/ranch country in north central KS. Great bird hunting.  Been out here since March riding out the virus.      \n\nWe\u2019re surrounded by 500k acres of private ranch and farmland and we are very close to the community.\n\nFriend just came by, told us about one of the hog farms here:\n\n- selling 300lb LIVE hogs for $120 (this is WAY below market value)\n- is slaughtering the piglets \n- has sold 100 so far\n- has 400~ more to sell\n- there are dozens more just like this farm\n\nThis is happening to all the ranchers out here and this area supplies a healthy percentage of the corn, beef and pork that you fucktards eat. \n\nSo...what to do with this info?", "created_utc": 1589744779.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/glly6n/ranchers_selling_off_stock_pennies_on_the_dollar/", "is_self": true}
