A wut? It's the bad thing that happens to your body after you get Corona Virus.\n\nBasically your immune system sucks, so it goes into a full-blown attack which causes your lungs to fill with liquid and you die (ARDS). Google ARDS. \n\nWhy nicotine?\n\nBecause nicotine stops your immune system from working properly by inhibiting LPS-induced cytokine production. Scientists think that this is why smokers don't have Asthma, even though they should.  \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26992678\n\nYou're fucking dumb. Yes, I am. But, I am an internet sleuth and I've found some crazy shit that backs this idea up like this 1996 study:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8930570\n\"Eleven healthy male non-smokers were included in this study. The volunteers applied nicotine patches with a regulated release of 5 mg (day 1 and 2), 10 mg (day 3 and 4) and 15 mg (day 5, 6 and 7) nicotine per day.\"  \n\"RESULTS:\nTreatment with nicotine caused a significant inhibition of IL-10 production by NAC. In contrast, nicotine patch treatment had no effect on the production of IL-2 and TNF alpha.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nNicotine in vivo has an inhibitory effect on TH2 cell function as measured by inhibition of IL-10 production, but does not appear to have any effect on TH1 cell function.\"  \nIL-10 = cytokine\n\nNicotine fucks the cyotkine production up and the nicotine patch is the perfect delivery system.\n\nSeems like people smarter than me looked into this before for H1N1 Flu Virus:\n\u202ahttps://www.sott.net/article/237552-Nicotine-is-an-Anti-inflammatory-Cure-for-H1N1-Flu-Virus\u202c\n\n\"Nicotine, although one of the most addictive chemicals, can have beneficial effects on inflammatory diseases, such as arthritis, asthma, cancer, inflammatory bowel diseases and perhaps, H1N1.\"\nwhich found...\n\"Ricin-treated mice can be protected by nicotine prior or after the cytokine storm begins.\"\n\n\n\u202aEbola Zmapp treatment that was credited with saving 5/7 patients made with \u201ctobacco species\u201d\u202c\n\n\u202ahttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26946569/\u202c\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/Nicotine_It_may_have_a_good_side\n\nHarvard:\n\"Nicotine binds to the nerve cell receptors known as nicotinic or nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Depending on the receptor and other factors, that binding may speed up the signaling between nerve cells or slow it down. There are at least a dozen nicotinic receptors; their functions are varied and overlap but often involve the processing of thoughts.\"\n\n\nhttps://jneuroinflammation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12974-016-0725-1\n\n\"\nResults\nNicotine treatment dose dependently limits the production of critical proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 (60.5\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3, %inhibition), IL-1\u03b2 (42.4\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7, %inhibition), and TNF-\u03b1 (68.9\u2009\u00b1\u20097.7, %inhibition) by activated human astrocytes. Interestingly, it also inhibits IL-8 chemokine (31.4\u2009\u00b1\u20098.5, %inhibition), IL-13 (34.243\u2009\u00b1\u20094.9, %inhibition), and butyrylcholinesterase (20.8\u2009\u00b1\u20092.8, %inhibition) production at 100 \u03bcM. \"\nNow, I'm not a doctor, not a researcher, not a scientist. I don't even know what the fuck the above means. Just putting it out there on the odd fucking weird chance that nicotine patches somehow stop the beer flu. \n\nDISCLAIMER: Not a medical professional. This is NOT medical advice. Smoking will kill you, we're talking about nicotine patches here. Just trying to think outside the box to inspire peeps that there are different ways of solving a fucking problem than just watching it on the news. If you're dying anyways, and the nicotine patch is your last hope, doesn't seem like it would do much harm to give it a shot. $GSK makes the patches", "created_utc": 1583885148.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fgnwns/cure_for_a_virus_is_a_virus_gsk/", "is_self": true}
