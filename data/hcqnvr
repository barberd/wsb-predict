I said we would go to 3090 b4 a violent reversal & that is what happened. also said we would kiss 3080 on monday but I'm sure many of u didnt listen & lost more $ but dont u worry cuz my retarded ass has decided to let u kno what the fuck is up again\n\nFirst and foremost. Not financial advice so if you go all in on this shit and lose your fucking money. dont blame me. we'll lose money together <3\n\nthere is 1 chart & 1 chart only u need to look at & it reveals everything- here it is zoomed out\n\n[\\/es daily](https://preview.redd.it/9qly1nj3t3651.png?width=1580&format=png&auto=webp&s=caf2ff71a8784d2874c73654078378e3870dd1a6)\n\n[zoomed in](https://preview.redd.it/3du6ux67t3651.png?width=1579&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d266f50feb7364d9ee5f419c7ad26b9d36e9e3c)\n\ndont u worry- here to explain what this shows us. if u look back, /es has respected that trendline datin back to fuckin 2017 - whether it acted as support or resistance it always is respected. so lets fuckin look at friday session - what happend?\n\nwell in my part 1 post i said look for bull trap goin into close and that is exactly wtf happend. i dont find it to b a coincidence that we got a massiv fuckin rejection at the intersection of all 3 trendlines. that was a fuckin flush afterhours, well coordinated bulltrap goin into what will b a bloody week.\n\nwhat else happened yesterday? /ES lost the 5 EMA which has acted as support last few sessions. we have masive negative divergence buildin in rsi, slo stoch curling, all settin up for a bloody week.\n\nso in my 1st post called 4 target of 2800-2850 in next few weeks, knew last week would b borin as fuck but was great opportunity to load up with vix crush so im well positioned for a flush this week.\n\ni think we kiss 2800 this week then as i stated b4, market gonna make a decision and many of u are gonna b on the wrong side and get absolutely fucked. \n\n[GEX again massive plummet](https://preview.redd.it/pr6oqkahr3651.png?width=1914&format=png&auto=webp&s=86f6538f02310e391ae831744fa996c07ad10578)\n\nDIX is high as fuck while GEX plummet lower fri - what does this tell us? same fuckin thing as last week so im literally gonna copy pasta what i wrote last post re: GEX/DIX -\n\n*GEX and DIX is far above most of you retards to understand so i'll say this - Remember GEX is hedging OBLIGATIONS and acts as a brake on the DIX price. Why would MM\u2019s have drastically lower hedging obligations while DIX is still high?* ***Because the only volume left on the Dark Pools is retail by proxy of Market makers. Don't buy fucking calls***\n\n[spx daily](https://preview.redd.it/oe2wxq0xs3651.png?width=1584&format=png&auto=webp&s=d656b379fdd335160d1556ad6896f89cef6315e5)\n\n1st test next week gonna b 3021 which also lines up right around the 200/150 MAs, break thru that & we see 2922, break thru that we get my target 2800 - then market gonna pick do we drop down to 2600ish or see big reversal back above 3000? i think it would set up reversal play higher (yea im not a fuckin permabear believe it or not, i do go long u fucks) but that remains 2 b seen\n\npositions since u retards gonna spam it in the comments - \n\njuly monthly exp - SPX 2800/2850 puts, vix 50/55/60/80 calls, xlf puts (banks r fuked)\n\naug monthly exp - vix 50/80/100 calls", "created_utc": 1592675816.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hcqnvr/you_ready_for_this_shit_part_2/", "is_self": true}
