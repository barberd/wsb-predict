Here's an updated pick list that I will play into on Monday for anyone interested", "selftext": "**All Calls:**\n\nNFLX - $340/$350 for 1/31\n\nAAPL - $320/330 1/31 + Adding (if previous position does well) into $340/350  6/19.\n\nAMD - $45/50 small play 1/31 (Not very confident about it's ER, albeit probably superb guidance) \n\n \\+ adding $50 3/20 and $55 6/19 post ER.\n\nSBUX - You already know this gonna be the big boy play. $90/92.5/95 2/14 + $92.5/95 6/19\n\nEPZM Shares - Option pricing too large of range. FDA approved good drug but small market. They are testing to expand into larger market. Hoping to enter $22-22.50 and exit $40-50 in the long term. Will do only 50-60 shares.", "created_utc": 1579901342, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/etgxep/happy_friday_heres_an_updated_pick_list_that_i/", "is_self": true}
