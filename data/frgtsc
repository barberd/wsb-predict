{"id": "frgtsc", "title": "SPY TA Price Action Possibilities", "selftext": "TA: https://imgur.com/a/6YM3kri\n\nBased off what I\u2019m seeing SPY broke out of its upward channel and hit $245 during futures. With current price action it\u2019s forming a Elliot Wave pattern sequence. Currently we are in wave four based off the wave pattern. If price holds there it can bounce upward towards 255+ given wave 5 is usually the shortest compared to 1 & 3. Also wave 3 can never be the smallest for the pattern to be valid. After all five waves are complete, it is followed by a ABC retracement. If the Elliot wave pattern fails we can see a drop towards 230 or less. \n\nTL;DR wait for an entries and don\u2019t be retarded. \n\n[EDIT]\nPositions: https://m.imgur.com/a/kZ3Mu7T", "created_utc": 1585528544.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frgtsc/spy_ta_price_action_possibilities/", "is_self": true}
