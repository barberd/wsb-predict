Every opex for the last year has resulted in GEX falling off a cliff and ending in or damn near a temporary trough. In most cases this happens over the course of a day or two, and it routinely closes opex day out with a lower GEX print. What does this mean for markets? A potential slingshot and snowball effect. Sharp drops in GEX often leads to a short term pullback in equities usually shown within a few days. It\u2019s hard to make substantial moves in either direction with a high GEX. \n\nBear case: GEX falls off a cliff tomorrow slingshotting equities lower which is then compounded by negative dealer gamma causing a March like crash. \n\nVXX 7/17 50c, SPY 7/17 300p, TQQQ 7/17 80p\n\nBull case: GEX falls off a cliff tomorrow temporarily bringing equity\u2019s down in the next few days to set up the next leg higher to SPY 330. Gives GEX a chance to reset and play into the snowball effect that allows for big moves up.\n\nSPY 7/17 330c, QQQ 7/17 250c\n\nLet\u2019s see how they want to play it.", "created_utc": 1592531454.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hbrrcb/big_move_coming/", "is_self": true}
