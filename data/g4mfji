Here\u2019s my reasoning. \n\nThis morning, I dropped someone off at the airport. As expected, there were 0 people in the line by the curb. Only one cop posted up outside. This person texted me in the airport, telling me there was no one in line for check-in, no one at the line for security, and then 30 people at the gate. 30 people. \n\nNext stop, Minneapolis. No one in the airport. Next flight, 7 people. 7 people on a Boeing 737. He sent me photos of him in his first class seat that he got for dirt cheap in comparison to pre-covid. \n\nNow here\u2019s what Im thinking. No ones traveling right now and people are buying into overpriced bullshit because they think they can try and make money off this spike. Fuck it, guy is home right now, he just learned about trading and he\u2019s going to drop some money that he has into the market because every goddam person is telling him it\u2019s going to rebound as the economy opens up again. But no ones traveling, people are out of fucking jobs, there\u2019s people moving out of state. I don\u2019t think this market rebound is sustainable. I don\u2019t trust the Fed, I don\u2019t trust JPow, I don\u2019t trust anyone.", "created_utc": 1587358108.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g4mfji/im_doing_something_retarded_but_i_have_this/", "is_self": true}
