{"id": "gdh2bv", "title": "AAWW Earnings Play - Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc.", "selftext": "Intro:\n\nAtlas Air, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings, is a cargo airline, passenger charter airline, and aircraft lessor. AAWW is the parent company of Atlas Air and Polar Air Cargo, which together operate the world's largest fleet of Boeing freighter aircraft.\u00a0\n\nThoughts:\n\nMajor passenger airline services are going down bigly recently, more panic selling coming in today as big boy Buffet said he's sold all airline positions. However, the KEYWORD here is \"Cargo airline\". Ever since the beer virus started the cargo airlines were running non stop 34/7 to unsure the flow of the supply chain. AAWW should directly benefit from this.\n\nAlong with the big oil drop recently, cargo airline should benefit bigly as well. I can't seem to find the info on whether AAWW signed oil price hedge contracts tho. Yall are welcome to add.\n\nTA:\n\nPrice dropped from $32.22 to $16.42 during the crash and now it's back to $32 again. Broke through an uptrend tunnel a little ago and went back down for price correction.\n\nThe stock is trading with a P/E ratio of 5.37, which compares to its industry's average of 14.06. Over the last 12 months, AAWW's Forward P/E has been as high as 7.75 and as low as 2.83, with a median of 5.35.\n\nEarnings:\n\nHistorically reported very strong numbers during Q1 and Q4. Beat 4/4 earnings in 2018, 2/4 earnings in 2019.\n\nThe estimate for this Q1 is a complete joke, $0.02. AAWW would have a really nice surprise. Although there's a lot uncertainty ahead, with the unique positioning in the market, AAWW would either offer no guidance or positive guidance.\n\nConclusion:\n\nAAWW is well positioned during this pandemic, with everything showing positive indicators for the recent future of this company.\n\n$AAWW 35c 05/15, 30c 40c 08/21(covers next earnings as well)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit1: Earnings date is 5/7 pre market\n\nEdit2: Donny hyping up AAWW [https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1245092603311411207](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1245092603311411207)\n\nEdit3: Not the best volume tbh, however, solid performance = good gains.", "created_utc": 1588616761.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gdh2bv/aaww_earnings_play_atlas_air_worldwide_holdings/", "is_self": true}
