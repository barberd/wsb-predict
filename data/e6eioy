Peloton might be a cool new gimmick for the season but none of that will have becky's telling their husbands to invest in the stock..... what exactly would be the point of anyone investing in this stock? **Its not like Beyond Meat meme or TSLA where they are actually trying to change a huge industry with cutting edge bullshit.**\n\nPeloton is just a bullshit recycled overpriced product using viral psychological marketing to make everyone talk about (THE PRODUCT)... and wall street will see this and just expect a nice blowjob from Karen when she gets off her overpriced bike with a stupid screen that will end up pissing her off on her period. theres nothing special about this stock. \n\nthe hype is in the product... not the stock.  think like someone on wallstreet...  who the fuck thinks this is a good INVESTMENT...  its not.  its a maybe possibly cool new gimmick workout machine...  **there is NOTHING revolutionary about it, and there is no growth potential...  prove me wrong there if you can.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# TLDR: peloton is viral &amp; seasonal PRODUCT HYPE... with a limited future because its a gimmick. the stock isnt gonna sore like REAL meme stocks. this isnt EVEN a meme stock, its just a garbage IPO and ultimately a garbage product that will end up in the garage after a year.\n\nsorry but this isnt a becky stock the way Starbucks or LULU. its being marketed as a becky product in hopes of achieving becky status... it wont.", "created_utc": 1575535602, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e6eioy/peloton_is_garbage_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
