Shame he made them puts on an ER...that was definitely retarded. \n\nOn the flip-side, AAPL is now at an ATH ($255.xx) with a solid run up in the last month. Given that ER is out of the way, and the news on Apple being effected in the Chinese market with fallout that could, in the near future, have a solid pullback. \n\nI know only a retard would bet against Apple (in the long term) but in the short term, very near term aka a faggots delight, maybe a $250 put isn\u2019t auch a bad play? Break even right now would be around 248.50ish...I don\u2019t see that as impossible given the strong run up in recent weeks.\n\n\nI quote:\n\n\u201cWhat goes up, must come down.\u201d -Some asshole.\n\nSerious thoughts though, looking for some feedback in this discussion on your guys thoughts.", "created_utc": 1572706553, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dql99e/so_about_them_aapl_puts/", "is_self": true}
