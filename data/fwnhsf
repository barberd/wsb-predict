{"id": "fwnhsf", "title": "Only post about calls for the next week.", "selftext": "Ok listen to me, guys. We should have seen this coming. The market was heading down this week, I should have been deep ITM on my puts. However, a poster named u/variation-separate or u/separate-variation or u/separate-me-from-my-bank-account whatever his name is decided to make a big DD post with lots of fancy words and many of you probably told your mothers about it. Point is, he got everyone in solidarity to go short and buy tons of PUTS. Obviously MMS saw this happening after browsing this subreddit, and decided to make money off all us schmucks. We are NEVER supposed to be that confident in one direction of the market, easiest inverse in history (hindsight 2020). So please, STOP making posts about waiting for your puts to print, PLEASE continue only making posts about your calls, and your gains from calls. Let\u2019s all work together to create a subreddit narrative that we are ALL LONG on the stock market and STOP TALKING ABOUT YOUR SHORTS/PUTS. \n\nThank you.", "created_utc": 1586276820.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fwnhsf/only_post_about_calls_for_the_next_week/", "is_self": true}
