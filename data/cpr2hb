{"id": "cpr2hb", "title": "Reminder: Tomorrow Germany will publicize its GDP numbers for Q2.", "selftext": "It will likely be negative. This is somewhat priced in with falling bunds, but the [bundesbank still projects a positive Gdp growth of 0.6% for the year](https://www.bundesbank.de/en/press/press-releases/new-bundesbank-projection-moderate-growth-for-the-german-economy-798474). The [forecast is -0.1%](https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/german-gdp-131) for Q2, so just slightly negative. But with drasticly falling exports (see post 2 ) it could be a lot lower (e.g. -0.3%)  which almost completly dminishes Q1. So prepare for further falling yields on the bunds and therefore falling yields on US treasuries tomorrow.\n\nOld posts from me in the last \\~2 weeks about the current situation in Germany:      [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cnzabd/german_exports_shrank_8_yoy_and_imports_44/)[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/chmlm7/german_businesses_are_the_least_confident_about/)", "created_utc": 1565690941, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cpr2hb/reminder_tomorrow_germany_will_publicize_its_gdp/", "is_self": true}
