I am not the best writer, so I will bring my points as short statements for ease of digestion. I encourage you to think it through:\n\nBy now you know the market is manipulated\n\nEconomy is in a recession, but the market doesn\u2019t have to reflect it. Think about it. \n\nBy pumping the market Feds provide bailout to everyone\u2019s 401Ks. This is helpful when everyone is unemployed. \n\nBy pumping the market Feds save companies \u2013 they can sell their buybacks back to the market to raise cash.\n\nFeds are buying shares, therefore they nationalize the most important companies for the U.S. economy (they are all too big to fail now).\n\nOnly a fraction of printed cash injected into the markets will result in inflation, as institutional investors are not going to be cashing out.\n\nIf the market crashes and everyone loses their assets \u2013 there are no winners. Your brokerage will most likely go bankrupt too. It is a matter on national security not to let this happen.\n\nFeds can\u2019t manipulate the economy \u2013 which will be shit for a long time, but they can save the markets.\n\nIf you bet against economy, in feds eyes you deserve to lose all your tendies.\n\nIf you were in charge, you would do the same thing in order to keep the country from falling apart. \n\nJPOW told us in clear language that he will be aggressive with his printer.\n\nStonks only go up\n\nPosition: SPY 300C 5/1\n\nMy journey: I went from 700 ->6400 -> 2300.", "created_utc": 1586493665.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fy8iyc/a_case_for_becoming_a_bull/", "is_self": true}
