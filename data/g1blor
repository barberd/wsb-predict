{"id": "g1blor", "title": "This $HAS to work", "selftext": "Alright, here we go:\n\nHasbro is one of the largest toy makers in the world. Everyone is sitting at home just trying to get their kids to leave them alone for five minutes. Go to Target and look at the toy aisle. Hasbro. Go look at board games. If they're not sold out, almost all the big boys are Hasbro (Monopoly, MTG, Clue, Sorry, etc). Too lazy to leave the house? Go on Amazon. Not only does Hasbro own the majority of the first few pages of results for toys and board games, they barely have any inventory left. This is despite their [CEO stating that their supply chain in China was back up and running three weeks ago](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/23/coronavirus-hasbro-shares-soar-as-ceo-cites-great-demand-for-toys.html) and that they would be fully caught up by April. You'll see similar patterns on Target's website, especially if you try for in-store pickup.\n\nWe saw a [Christmas level spike](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=board%20games) in searches for board games, which are surprisingly a [larger portion of Hasbro's revenue than you'd think](https://hasbro.gcs-web.com/static-files/2e4dbabd-a54f-4253-a80e-f0a60a83bdaf). People are so bored at home they're buying board games they're never even going to play. \n\nObviously, the majority of Hasbro's revenue is from toys, and demand for these is largely driven by the success of their partnerships with movie studios (read: Disney). How many Frozen toys do you think [50 millions Disney+ subscribers](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/business/disney-plus-50-million-subscribers.html) works out to? Hell they may even make a little bit off that [shitty Trolls movie](https://deadline.com/2020/04/trolls-world-tour-record-digital-weekend-opening-day-1202906947/). Regardless, the #1 driver of demand right now is kids sitting at home with absolutely nothing to do but watch movies and demand the respective toys. Through its partnerships, Hasbro owns that market (although somehow they didn't have [Baby Yoda](https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/2/21/21146913/baby-yoda-animatronic-toy-hasbro-release-date-price-mandalorian-star-wars-disney) ready to go the day Mandalorian dropped).\n\nNow let's look at the stock itself. Hasbro had a strong 2019 and appeared to be rebounding from losing Toys R Us before missing Q3 earnings. However, they rebounded from this in Q4 and were back to comfortably trading in the $100-105 area (down from around $120 in Q3) even with concerns about their supply chain due to that weird virus in China. Then the virus came here, and they dropped like everyone else, bottoming out at $41. They've bounced back to some degree, trading at $75 now, but fundamentally, there's no reason they shouldn't be trading at pre-virus numbers. Their supply chain is back up, toys actually [perform relatively well](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/08/industries-thrive-on-recession.asp) during a recession, and the whole world has more leisure time than at any point in the past century. Also, one could argue that losing Toys R Us was the best thing for Hasbro long term because it [pushed them to actually embrace e-commerce](https://nypost.com/2019/02/20/hasbro-lego-launch-online-services-in-toys-r-us-absence/). They're arguably set up better than just about anyone for this exact scenario, yet they're trading at 21% below their 200 day MA. While similar at-home leisure goods (video games, fucking Peloton, etc) are at or near ATHs, their cheaper and more inelastic peer, Hasbro, is being treated like any other consumer product. \n\nHasbro will report earnings on 4/29, but Mattel, their closest competitor, will report on 4/23. If everything I've laid out here bears any weight, I believe $MAT will crush Q1 expectations and the market will quickly realize that $HAS will benefit from this virus even more (more diversified product line, stronger studio partnerships).\n\nThe biggest concern here is option volume. If you buy all this, you'll have to pay a premium to get in on it. Obviously volume will increase as we get closer to earnings, but I believe getting in before Mattel releases their numbers on 4/23 will be key. Secondary concern is supply chain, but honestly, even if there were a second outbreak in China, do we really believe they're going to let that shut down manufacturing again, and even if so, in the next two weeks? Hard to believe, but if that does happen, none of us will care because all our puts will finally print. \n\nI'm not putting a strike because you're better off finding the right price given low volume. Basically any call after 4/29. Right now I'm thinking $95 by mid-May.", "created_utc": 1586890954.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1blor/this_has_to_work/", "is_self": true}
