Making up 0.8% of the US pollution.\n\n2.) The numbers for the flu listed below are annual numbers.\n\n3.) Beer AIDS has only been here for ~6 weeks.\n\n**Flu**\n\nRougly 160 people die per day from the seasonal flu.\n\nThis means over a 4 day period, roughly 4.8 people will die from the flu in King county. \n\n**Beer AIDS**\n\nDeath rate per day pending, as the virus has only just arrived here.\n\nAlready it has killed 6 people in King county in a 4 day period. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nUnless beer AIDS has gone under the radar and infected hundreds of thousands of people in King county in a ~6 week period, it's likely a lot more fatal than the seasonal flu. Therefore it is not, \"JuSt A fLu BrO\" \n\nI predict once beer AIDS has run its course, it's deaths per capital will dwarf the seasonal flu by a large margin.\n\nTL;DR Buy calls on funeral homes", "created_utc": 1583196297, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fcma6t/why_beer_aids_will_infect_economy/", "is_self": true}
