In fact, its not a story at all. This is a biography. The biography of a man so unbelievably autistic he would make Forrest Gump look like Stephen Hawking without the spaghetti legs.\n\nSome things you should know about Randall the Brave before reading his journey through the stock market. He is a 48-year-old personal trainer that I have been working with for the past few years. He has a beautiful wife and 3 young kids between 12 and 15 years of age. Like mentioned below, Randall does not have a pension fund offered by his employer nor does he have a private one. Until now that is...\n\nThe journey of this brave soul begins at the dawn of the year 2018. \n\n\u201cNew Year, New Me!\u201d Randall says, looking as proud as ever. \n\n\u201cYou have a new year resolution in mind?\u201d I ask.\n\n\u201cYup. I started investing my money in the stock market today.\u201d He says back, with a sparkle in his eye. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s good! Its never too late to start investing. So, what did you put your money in? Some index funds? A bundle of safe and reliable dividend stocks?\u201d I say back. \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s all that about?\u201d He tells me, more confused than a black kid waiting on his father who went out for \u201cmilk\u201d 5 hours ago. \n\nAt this point I knew Randall did not know a single fucking thing about the stock market. How was he even able to open a brokerage account I thought to myself? How did he figure out how to send an order? Did he even know what a stock was?! \n\n\u201cSooo\u2026 What did you invest in then?\u201d I ask him. \n\n\u201cA weed company called ACB!\u201d Randall answers. \n\n\u201cAll of your money?\u201d I ask him back, starting to get a little worried.\n\n\u201cWell duh? Why wouldn\u2019t I put all of my money in??\u201d He tells me, while looking at me like I\u2019m the biggest retard on earth.\n\nI later learned that Randall had been looking at the yahoo finance chats about the ACB stock. And of course, like most of you degenerates, decided to take a leap of faith off the comments of a random user who thought the weed market was the biggest opportunity since the launch of the iPhone.   \n\n\u201cAnd how much is that\u2026?\u201d I finally ask.\n\n\u201c$350,000! Basically, my entire savings\u201d He answers, with that same sparkle in his eyes which I quickly realized was simply light reflecting off the back of his empty skull. \n\n\"But... Why\u2026\u201d I say back, trying to resist the urge to roundhouse kick Randall in the jaw. \n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t have a pension fund, so I figured I\u2019d create my own! This stock is going to like $50, and I bought it at 9$, I\u2019m going to be a millionaire!\u201d He answers, standing tall, proud, and most importantly, unbelievably autistic.", "created_utc": 1577971419, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eiy6pv/the_biography_of_randall_the_brave_part_1/", "is_self": true}
