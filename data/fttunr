Just set it and forget it. It's like a Christmas stocking stuffer from me to you.\n\nNot convinced? Do you need a fancy line chart to feel happy? Well check this shit out:\n\nhttps://images.app.goo.gl/dvxCCfpKdyajcfJ6A\n\nEdit - Nerd speak: The image above suggests that the downtrend may have broken signified by a double bottom reversal pattern based on 2011 support points. Take caution to review the entry points, \n\nDZ1, If price raises above 29 (SMA8)\n0.5 retracement, DZ2, If price drops below 27.1, and back to above 27.2\n\nG2: Gap UP above (SMA50) 29.3, market buy at open.\n\nIt already gapped up to 30.15 so entry point is clear on open.\n\nBest of all, IV is lower than your bank account on a Friday. So jump in on this price action while the getting is good!\n\nIt literally can't go tits up! *Except, it may fluctuate a tad over the next few months but I still expect some decent profits by December. \n\nSo, come on down to $XLE for some nice tendies and don't forget to collect your profits early because this market is bat shit crazy. \n\nThis is not financial advice and you shouldn't do anything without doing your own DD, you silly people.\n\n\n\n...\n...\n\nEdit: I've gotten some valuable feedback that forced me to clarify a little more of why I chose this trade. \n\nComment is below but the meat of my logic is here:\n\nMy belief is that this was an opportune time for oil negotiations between the Saudis and Russians to \"break down\" during a temporary \"demand shortage\" and the damage is not permanent. Both Nations and the US have no intention of letting this extend beyond June. What would the fun in that be if they got nothing out of the US in the process?\n\nI think this oil war is an opportunity for Trump to appear as a show piece before they magically announcing they've come to an agreement. The Saudis will probably get some shiney new missiles and the Russians will get sanctions eased. Meanwhile, oil prices will rise when demand will start picking up come the time when every shut in family decides to go on a road trip to the Grand canyon to celebrate their newly found freedom. \n\nThat's my DD.. If I wanted to hear my own ideas I'd just talk to myself. So please, rip it to shreads because I enjoy the discussion.", "created_utc": 1585859241.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fttunr/xle_cant_go_tits_up_anymore/", "is_self": true}
