{"id": "emu22x", "title": "NLOK advice?", "selftext": "Long time lurker, first time post, first option trade.\nThis is a small time bet so all you big time autists don't waste you're time here.\nSo I recently was gifted 54 shares of NLOK(formerly SYM). They are paying out a special dividend of $12.00 per share at the end of the month. So I guess my question to the more seasoned investors here is do you think that dividend is priced in? The stock is at about 26.15 right now. Should I bet that the stock will drop about 10 to 12 bucks a share after the payout? I would assume some holders are only holding because of this payout and will ditch it afterwards. \nThis would be my first options trade as I haven't developed full blown autism yet... Not sure if I want to either... So be gentle.", "created_utc": 1578676870, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/emu22x/nlok_advice/", "is_self": true}
