In January I was buying Webcams and computer accessories Logitech was the **bestselling** manufacturer in **every category**. I checked the same stuff that I bought in January in March and most of them are **sold out** and on back order. Third party sellers were asking $90 for a webcam I paid $30 for. My mouse was $15 but now going for $25. They also own **Blue Microphones** (Blue Yeti and Blue Snowball) **Jaybird** and **Astro Gaming.** Is Logitech expensive? Today it's at the same price as January. A lot of companies are **reimbursing staff for buying telecommunication equipment** such as webcams for zoom, teams, google hangout, .... Logitech had the top 3 bestselling webcams. Even some of their computer speakers are on backorder. \n\nWith schools closing early a lot of guys bought their peripherals for **gaming**. Their gaming products even have their own supreddit r/LogitechG. As we know gaming stocks have been on fire. Even one of the posts making to r/all was a LifeProTip to buy a good webcam to look good for work. \n\nPeople are starting to pick up on this trend. I was listening to a podcase in which an old grandma called and asked about investing in Logi just because she had noticed the pattern. I also noticed three of our members independently picked up on that pattern too: u/TorpCat an European dude, u/NicklasL1dstrom a gamer and sports fan from usa, and lastly u/MattMDL a gamer who understand computer peripherals. \n\n**Risk vs reward** looks attractive. Earnings is early next week. I picked up the stock and some calls for next week.", "created_utc": 1588949220.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gfuid0/logitech_logi_earnings_report_next_week/", "is_self": true}
