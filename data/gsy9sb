The Najarian Bro\u2019s called out some unusual call activity and I looked into it and sure enough BIG bets on ZNGA to keep on ripping. Option chain hasn\u2019t gone crazy yet, but I\u2019m expecting an IV spike come next week so now is the time to jump in on this play before the tendie train leaves the station. I don\u2019t think I need to explain what Zynga does, we have all played their games on our smartphones and you can just imagine the traffic spike that they saw during this pandemic. The Open Interest on $9 6/19 this morning was 11k and if you go look at it now it\u2019s well over 57k now. HUGE buys, why? Well that\u2019s what makes it \u201cunusual activity\u201d. Someone knows something that we don\u2019t and are betting big on it. They could be announcing how many new users they have; my best guess. And if you look at my Trading View chart on the 15sec, you only bullish volume throughout the day. Ride with me to tendie land you sums of guns.\n\nZNGA\n\n 7/17 10C\n\n7/17 9C\n\n[DD charts and OI](https://imgur.com/gallery/Z6dhUZY)", "created_utc": 1590776562.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gsy9sb/znga_zynga_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
