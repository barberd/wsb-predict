Disprove and downvote as much as you guys want. I dont give 2 fucks or share your thoughts on the matter. Guh****\n\nThe theory: \n\nSo we know that this shitshow started in China, then South Korea, then Japan....its like moving west so fast...then boom fucking California, Oregon, and now fucking Washington state...and yes I know a lot of flights are flying back and forth and what not BUT what if this shit is airborne....it seems like the wind is carrying it over the ocean..is that a possibility? Idk. I dont have any background in any of that science shit..I did however look up the wind maps (I'll attach the link below) and it seems like the flow of it is hitting the same states that are being effected. Maybe I'm crazy..good possibly I am) \n\nI dont know the wind directions from Asia but it makes sense if it moves west hitting all those spots \n\nAlso I dont know the wind directions from Asia yo Europe...maybe someone does. \n\nAlso the latest artical about the first US death said it was not travel or contact related\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\n\nAlways love to hear back some thoughts on this...disprove it or whatever. \n\n\nFor those who did not even read the story the short version of the theory: i think Its airborne. \n\n\nUSA: Wind Map:   http://hint.fm/wind/\n\nMap of effected areas: \nhttps://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6", "created_utc": 1583003676, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fbhg5o/a_theory_about_the_virus_its_airborne/", "is_self": true}
