{"id": "d0nb82", "title": "Playing earnings on less popular companies - am I missing something?", "selftext": "There's lots of chatter about earnings on recently IPO'ed companies or other companies in the Robinhood top 100 like this week's ZM, CRWD, and WORK.\n\nLooking at options pricing for these stocks ahead of earnings, there is usually at least a 5% move baked in and often times it's more.  But there are also companies where there is very little movement built into the options prices.  \n\nFor example if we look at the [earnings for next week](https://i.imgur.com/4IAwsDo.png) and review two couple companies:\n\n**ZScaler is announcing Tuesday after close (next option expiration is 9/13)**\n\n* Today's closing price: $64.05\n* $64 call expiring 9/13 is $4.15 ($4.00 bid / $4.30 ask) so you'll need +6.7% to break even\n* $64 put expiring 9/13 is $4.35 ($4.10 bid / $4.60 ask) so you'll need -7% next week to break even\n\n**HD Supply is announcing Tuesday before open (next option expiration is 9/20)**\n\n* Today's closing price: $40.29 \n* $40 call expiring 9/20 is $1.63 ($1.55 bid / $1.7 ask) so you'll need +3.3% to break even\n* $40 put expiring 9/20 is $1.33 ($1.25 bid / $1.40 ask) so you'll need -4% to break even\n\nIs HD Supply just that boring that it's not going to move at all following earnings? I realize it's a low volatility stock.  Last ER in June 2019 it closed prior to ER at 42.53, opened in the morning at 39.37 which is a drop of 7.43%, and closed at 40.06 down 5.81%. Not exactly a barn burner but still it moved after earnings and the options here have an extra week until expiration vs. the ones for ZScaler.  \n\nIf I were going to do a YOLO on some options next it seems like HD Supply is a way better play than ZScaler or any other tech earnings play because those options are too expensive.  Or possibly a straddle would be a more responsible move.  \n\nIs this a reasonable analysis or am I missing something?", "created_utc": 1567807229, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d0nb82/playing_earnings_on_less_popular_companies_am_i/", "is_self": true}
