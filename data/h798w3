This idiom is the underlying theory to a worryingly large amount of economics and investing. If everyone who sees a trend, signal, or yahoo finance bulletin, is going to react in the same autistic way (i.e. punching your mother/placing a bet and then staring at a bunch of lines for hours on end, while screaming gibberish with your shirt off) the outcome can be - roughly - estimated.\n\nBut what happens when autism is no longer at the bottom of the bell curve?\n\n\"But how could the curve skew to the right anymore?!\" I hear you ask.\n\nI'll answer that with a quote from my little brother \"Why did HTZ go from $4 to $5 to $2?\"\n\nBearing in mind he's using a VPN to access RH from Hong-Kong. I used to think 'Hey, that's one smart autistic fucking kid.\" (I know what I said).\n\nBut now I'm worried that rationality no longer applies. Imagine a community for kids with severe ASD. Now imagine someone with psychosis, bi-polar, or some kind of psychopathy let lose in there.\n\nMayhem.\n\nAutism makes ~~us~~ (*ahem*) 'them' slow learners. These new nutters have a higher volume of 'executive functions' (read: trades), but have no grasp on reality (i.e. they don't get Cramer's buy recommendations broadcast to the inside of their eyelids and have no idea who to short).\n\nTL;DR: Buy gold - your bachelors in stats or module in econometrics is fucking worthless.", "created_utc": 1591918240.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h798w3/is_hedging_against_autism_no_longer_sufficient/", "is_self": true}
