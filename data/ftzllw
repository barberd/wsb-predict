{"id": "ftzllw", "title": "You don\u2019t need to play OTM puts to double your money: Bear Put Spreads and how you\u2019re currently getting fucked by other bears.", "selftext": "Obligatory I\u2019m a bear.\n\nA lot of you guys are buying SPY 200p and 170p about 2 weeks out, some of you even sooner, but when you look at what profit potential there is out there, you\u2019ll hopefully realize how greedy those plays are.  There is a very high chance they expire worthless given the current IV.\n\nNow I know most of you guys don\u2019t know what a spread is and how to create one, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m here to show you; we know the SPY is trading around 250 right now.  Take a SPY 260 Put for 4/15 trading at 12.76 for example.  Now look at a 250 SPY Put also for 4/15 trading at 8.22.\n\nSomething Robinhood will let you do (by pressing that fancy little select button in the top right corner of the screen when buying options) is go long on the 260 put and go short on the 250 put in a single transaction.  So why the fuck would you do this, you ask?... why the fuck are you selling puts if you think the market is going down?\n\nWell thats where you\u2019re retarded.  If you take the 12.76 cost of the long minus the 8.22 cost of the short, you have a trade that is worth 4.54 dollars.  Robinhood will let you buy both at once for 4.54 in a SINGLE TRADE and treat it as a SINGLE ASSET.\n\nSo how is that helpful?  Well lets say the doomsday preppers are right, and SPY goes to 200 dollars.  Are you fucked? No; you have a 260 put and you sold a 250 put, so you have turned about 4 dollars into exactly 10.  That isn\u2019t ideal, because you couldve made a lot more with just the put, though you did make over 100%... But now consider a scenario that all of us (except me) fucking dread.  The market doesnt move.  With this play, EVEN IF YOU ARE BETTING AGAINST THE MARKET AND IT DOESN\u2019T EVEN MOVE FOR THE ENTIRE 2 WEEKS, YOU MAKE OVER 100%.  (If Spy closes at 250, the 260 put is worth 10 dollars and the 250 put is worth 0, you turned 454 into 1000). And guess who is paying for your tendies? Whichever poor fucker bought your lower-strike put because 100% gain wasn\u2019t enough for their greedy ass.\n\nAnd another thing that\u2019s nice, YOUR BREAKEVEN PRICE IS ABOVE WHAT YOU BUY AT.  The markets can go in the wrong fucking direction and you can still make money.  For that trade, if you open it when SPY is trading near 250, SPY can close at over 255 2 weeks later and you\u2019ll still break even.  Theta who?\n\nWe all keep getting pissed off that the market isn\u2019t reacting to the world exploding, so why not make an easy bet that it just won\u2019t fucking rally as the states get into deeper shit?  We are all pretty confident that things at least wont get better as more and more people lose their jobs.  So lets start making some less retarded plays so days like today don\u2019t melt our gains.  100% in 2 weeks is fucking great and should take years, stop being so greedy and just win instead.\n\n[260\\/250 Spread as Mentioned.  If SPY closes at or below 250 I have 20 grand, nice.  The 230\\/225 locks me in an extra 7500 bucks if SPY closes at or below 225.  I purchased those spreads at around 80 dollars a piece and each can earn a maximum of 500 dollars.  525&amp;amp;#37; potential gain.](https://preview.redd.it/5kym3wjpkiq41.jpg?width=750&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1d538467578e60b2fffec509cd2c1b0054576991)\n\n*TL;DR You can double your money in under 2 weeks in any scenario that the market doesn\u2019t move up.  That\u2019s some good shit.*\n\nEdit: Holy fucking christ it\u2019s so hard to get posts approved.  I don\u2019t want to post in investing.\n\nEdit 2: Lol yes you can lose money.  You lose everything if it closes ABOVE 260, which most of us would cry bloody murder to in 2 weeks anyway.  Also just make sure the guy on the short leg doesn\u2019t sell you 100 shares by exercising, in that case, just sell everything and you\u2019ll be fine.  Re-open another position if you want.  RH may actually just exercise your long leg for you, which would make more sense.\n\nEdit 3: No, you do not need cash collateral to open the trade.  The short leg\u2019s potential losses are completely covered by the long leg.", "created_utc": 1585879690.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ftzllw/you_dont_need_to_play_otm_puts_to_double_your/", "is_self": true}
