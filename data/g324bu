{"id": "g324bu", "title": "Question about NVDA and Mellanox approval", "selftext": "Hello.  I've had this question for months now:  Why does a company like NVIDIA (an American company) need to get 'approval' from China to buy Mellanox (also an American (and Israeli) company).  It seems like it has been China that has held up this deal for months now...  It seems to me that some American company should be able to buy some other American company REGARDLESS of what China thinks, no?\nThanks in advance,\n-Person who doesnt understand wtf China has to do with this", "created_utc": 1587130540.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g324bu/question_about_nvda_and_mellanox_approval/", "is_self": true}
