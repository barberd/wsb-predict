{"id": "gkf0gx", "title": "Square (SQ) Put Holders Obituary", "selftext": "Context : Played SQ 75p 05/15 with 18.5k and sold it at a loss of 7k. Made three day trades on FB yesterday and recouped my losses. My retarded eyes went towards SQ again and i said fuck it lets buy SQ 75P 06/19.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n* Transactions were Square's biggest revenue generator in 2019, but Bitcoin sales were its fastest-growing area.\n* Square revised its net revenue and gross profit expectations because so much of Square's revenue is generated from merchant transactions, and because many businesses across the country have effectively been shut down during the crisis, Square anticipates substantial negative impact to its revenue for the near future.\n\nSQ Revenue Breakdown for FY 2019 :\n\n|Transaction-Based Revenue|65%|\n|:-|:-|\n|Subscription and Service-Based Revenue|22%|\n|Hardware Revenue|2%|\n|Bitcoin Revenue|11%|\n\nJack Shit Part Time CEO and Square Capital offered exclusive access to business loans for small business which are not able to pay it back.\n\nAll the DD, TA, Analyst rating pointed towards fair value at mid 60's. I was hard af after looking at 'Retail sales plunge a record 16.4% in April, far worse than predicted' today morning as the restaurants  and other service business were lagged in revenues which use Square. Meanwhile square is on its way to 52 week high fucking me over with its big dick energy.\n\nCan some one explain me why is this going higher and higher everyday ? I understand PYPL to gain momentum as more people are buying online and shit, but SQ payment API isn't even integrated in any of the sites normal people shop at. All they have working right now is a Venmo like looking app where you can send money for free (no transaction fee unless for higher limits), Buy Bitcoin for a high fee (while robinhood has no fee but with out withdrawals) and buy fractional shares. Nothing makes sense anymore. Stocktwits is cancer. Peace out.\n\nTLDR: SPY 420p 06/19\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9agvdde26zy41.jpg?width=686&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d33148491cb3f3a7adea0f730cb5932bb83760f3", "created_utc": 1589568585.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gkf0gx/square_sq_put_holders_obituary/", "is_self": true}
