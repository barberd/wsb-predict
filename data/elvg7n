{"id": "elvg7n", "title": "$TSLA Tendies", "selftext": "So I've been buying and selling TSLA the last couple weeks.  10 contracts here, 10 contracts there for small gains.  But let's be real.  This company still has many tendies to bring home for us all.  Instead of doing something weekly I was thinking about buying past their next earnings report or maybe even further, but I'm not sure where to jump in at.  Obviously I wouldn't want ITM or NTM options for long distance expiry dates.  So let's say for instance I wanted the week after earnings.  \n\nDo I want to go to the closest to the current limit price for NTM contracts?  Or maybe a respectable $500 call option?    \nI'm learning more and more how option trading works, but this one eludes me.  How does one make a lot of profit if the limit price is so high when buying a few weeks out and picking close to the current stock price?", "created_utc": 1578502986, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/elvg7n/tsla_tendies/", "is_self": true}
