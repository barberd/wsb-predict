The moon (assuming we've been there) as we know it is just a big gray lump of coal that we can't get to fuck off out of our gravitational pull or whatever. Don't even get me started on the tides cause nobody gives a fuck, we aren't surfers. Anyways, everyone always talks about stocks going to the moon but think about it the moon sucks and isn't that far away. Tesla, on the other hand, is *actually* going to mars. Mars is badass. Elon is taking us loyal shareholders into fucking outer space. Also, mars is several galaxies further into space compared to the moon, so think about the relative tendies. Don't settle for the moon, go to mars!! Not convinced? Still a moon-er? (ew) At least mars is dignified enough to hang from my ceiling and have water. Don't care about space? Think people are satisfied with air travel? just look at BA, we're all shorting those shitty 7qwerty7s back down to earth. LONG Elon cause once we get out of this shitty atmosphere there's no gravity to bring our accounts back down.", "created_utc": 1576537679, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ebmuto/tesla_to_the_mars_confirmed_dd/", "is_self": true}
