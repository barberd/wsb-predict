I think this will eventually go the way of ARRY- they announce their main, long awaited, biggest, trial stops early due to efficacy, they release data at a conference a few weeks later, and then get bought out a few weeks after that. No way a drug company like ACAD with a single drug and multiple uses stays independent. It makes too much sense for a large drug company with no organic growth and a large sales force to buy them and to fire all the sales force and layer in the drug with their existing sales people... just a matter of when. I have Jan 2020 $45 calls so I hope the full data gets released earlier rather than later... but make no mistake, the trial was stopped early due to exceptional p-value. \n\nOriginal write-up and thesis\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/co7f7s/acad\\_acadia\\_pharmaceuticals\\_thesis/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/co7f7s/acad_acadia_pharmaceuticals_thesis/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)", "created_utc": 1568658800, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d547cx/acad_update_on_where_i_think_it_goes_from_here/", "is_self": true}
