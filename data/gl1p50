Some of this is priced in but there is still room for growth especially after Cisco's earnings call statements regarding MFA services (see section 5.1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. OKTA provides platform agnostic cloud-based multi-factor authentication for end-users with a focus on secure remote resource access.\n2. The world has been moving towards MFA/2FA for a few years now and Covid-19 is going to this product segment into the stratosphere.\n3.

DUO being the OKTA competitor and Umbrella being a DNS-based cloud security offering. \n\n* From the Cisco earnings call \"Our cloud security portfolio performed well with strong double-digit growth and continued momentum with our Duo and Umbrella offerings.\"\n* What does Cisco have the OKTA doesn't? A metric-ton of hardware liabilities potentially dragging them down. OKTA is cloud infrastructure with an SLA that can't be impacted by physical production roadblocks.\n* OKTA is also more competitively priced than DUO for organizations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFull disclosure, I'm an engineer in the field of cybersecurity and have been for the last 7 years.", "created_utc": 1589660707.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gl1p50/okta_earnings_528/", "is_self": true}
