{"id": "g0ykbw", "title": "Printing Press The Longs", "selftext": "TL;DR - tactical short on the printer and the combined \\~810K net long contracts of /ZB and /UD held by asset managers, or $81 billion. This short is a *long game.*\n\nA record $1.6 trillion is market value over par value was recorded in March 2020 for marketable treasury debt. In super simplified terms, if you bought every treasury at auction, you'd have mucho tendies in capital gains.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Treasury Tendies, Source: SIFMA, Dallas Fed](https://preview.redd.it/b9lr61lhdps41.png?width=1763&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ad66c5e2d090bf66d7da31844fb3193c311b3e6)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTruth is, there is so much of this shit out there that as a percentage gain, you'd be up roughly 9%. This has historically been a ceiling. Chart below compares this to the 10-year yield (proxy).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Source: FRED, Dallas Fed](https://preview.redd.it/tb1jm65zdps41.png?width=1115&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9693a573cefc574f4d688deb707e5c49d2a7209)\n\nThis ain't a technical top like you think of with TA on charts. Issuance could fix this, and likely will, no problem, rendering the trade useless. Charts below reflect 10Y yield performance after so-called ceiling has been hit. Lots of moving parts, lots of patience- lost 69% of you right there. For the 13.37% of you still reading, there are still plenty of ways to make money, e.g. sell calls in certain ETPs. Ideally, premium collected used to finance bearish bets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Source: FRED, Dallas Fed](https://preview.redd.it/oyk9q0qoeps41.png?width=838&format=png&auto=webp&s=2feb10297f272a6a057d53b7174e1611cafd9376)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Source: FRED, Dallas Fed](https://preview.redd.it/q7pnfynpeps41.png?width=852&format=png&auto=webp&s=af38641a9e932d12f47d0feac85b58475173e107)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Source: FRED, Dallas Fed](https://preview.redd.it/269wrioqeps41.png?width=839&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4a5cef636ddc7eadfc6ba0b7b701e34caf9cd28)\n\n2001-2004 time period was the only period which a tactical short on the 10Y would likely have failed. As mentioned before, if wrong, likely due to supply brought onto market which seems quite reasonable given present day events.
