{"id": "ew0ybe", "title": "Free Money Opportunity", "selftext": "$AIMT is about to get FDA approved for a peanut allergy drug by 1/31 that will send the shares soaring.  Nestle already owns 19% of the shares and there's a huge chance that they'll buy them out.  Estimates would be at about $60 a share for the buyout, and at prices currently $32.38, there's a ton of money to be made.  The FDA advisory board voted 7-2 in favor of the drug, and while that doesn't mean it's guarenteed to be approved, drugs with the advisory board's support pass 90% of the time!  So there's a 9 out of 10 chance we will be making tons of money!!  In addition, AIMT has a lot of new recent job openings, and if they weren't getting this drug approved, why would they be looking for so many new employees?  I'm all on board this train and if this isn't approved pre-market tomorrow, we only have a couple of more days before the end of the month so get those 2/21 calls while you have the chance!", "created_utc": 1580364979, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ew0ybe/free_money_opportunity/", "is_self": true}
