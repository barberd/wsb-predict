{"id": "ewa9w0", "title": "Obvious watertight proof that TSLA can literally only keep going up", "selftext": "So I asked this question to a friend a while back that proves I'm a genius and also proves that it's impossible for TSLA to go down. We were talking about what the cafeteria was going to have for lunch today because I was in my first year of college (I went to business school so you can trust me on this. I did Toastmasters). So I go to Google and type in the school cafeteria website and in that moment I had a thought and asked him:\n\n\n**\"What would Google have to do, or what would actually have to happen for Google to go bankrupt?\"**\n \n \n \n \nIt would have to be something so catastrophic that every business in the world would simultaneously stop functioning. I'm 150% sure that Tesla is in the same exact situation.\n\n\n\nLiterally what is Tesla? Tesla doesn't even exist. It's ingrained into our minds as a car company but he's memeing the shit out of everybody on social media. It's all a huge fucking meme and people are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to support it. He put a shitty iPad on a car chassis and sold it to people with iPads and laptops and iPhones. You can't even remove it from the car. It doesn't even have 4k (need a citation for this). \n\n\nAt this point it makes no sense to say Tesla will do anything but go up because it would literally take a world ending scenario for anything else to happen. In fact, there's a Tesla **IN FUCKING SPACE.** So the fact is that it would require the legitimate end of the universe for Tesla to go down. Musk said \"a cybertruck might exist in 2 years\" and people threw him millions of dollars. He's using the Call of Duty pre-order model except without refunds and these retards are still finding ways to believe this isn't watertight You can't put a valuation on this. Nobody can. Not even me and I went to business school.\n\n\nYou're welcome. I have to go my boss just walked in.", "created_utc": 1580410442, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ewa9w0/obvious_watertight_proof_that_tsla_can_literally/", "is_self": true}
