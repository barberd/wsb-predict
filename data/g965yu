{"id": "g965yu", "title": "Are the anecdotal reports of huge traffic at Home Depot and Lowe's stores reflected in the stock price? A quick DD on a possible earnings play", "selftext": "Tl;dr A lot of people have noticed the massive crowds at Home Depot and Lowe's of late.  This past weekend I did some Google Trends DD to see if that's really showing up numerically somewhere.  I found that HD and Lowe's are both at **all time highs** for search interest, with trends since February comparable to Corona plays like Netflix and Amazon, except more linear.  It's worth noting that unlike those stocks, HD and Lowe's haven't yet recovered or exceeded their pre-virus prices, although they have had a bit of a run-up today and Friday.\n\n\n[Home Depot and Lowe's have seen a steady, sharp increase in search activity since March](https://i.imgur.com/1YAZ8zK.png).  In fact it appears to be an all-time high, even more than the holiday season.  And HD/Lowe's are pretty insulated from the Amazonification of shopping- a lot of their stuff is convenience based, or bulky items, or stuff you want to check out in person.\n\n[Compare to the CV19 All-Star stocks Amazon and Netflix, along with Wal-Mart to compare to Amazon as a retailer](https://i.imgur.com/H1F4Kn7.png), there is a similar but more linear uptick for the home improvement stores.  And AMZN/NFLX/WMT stocks are at all-time highs.\n\n[Etsy, Ebay, and Wayfair have seen upticks in search activity similar to the hardware/home improvement stores](https://i.imgur.com/lO7oop7.png).  (Side note, in contrast to these, Poshmark took a severe hit during the onset of the outbreak- used clothing not so hot during a virus outbreak I guess- although a recovery seems to be underway). However, their stocks have mostly already recovered their pre-corona prices.  Still some room to run possibly, if you think the landscape has permanently changed in their favor.  eBay especially has potential to challenge Amazon in online retail if they can get on the right track.\n\nJust for comparison to Wayfair, HD, and Lowe's- [nobody much cares about Bed Bath and Beyond right now](https://i.imgur.com/wBXgwgt.png), which is just as well since their stores are closed. \n\nBottom line, the hardware/home improvement stores are tracking the hot internet stocks in terms of search interest and anecdotal feet through the doors, yet their valuations have lagged.  I wonder if the markets are overweighting the loss of construction business.  This could present an opportunity for HD/Lowe's to surprise at earnings, which is really what an earnings play is all about.\n\nPositions: \n\nHD 6/19 220c, 245c\n\nLOW 6/19 110c", "created_utc": 1588011511.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g965yu/are_the_anecdotal_reports_of_huge_traffic_at_home/", "is_self": true}
