The CHPA would investigate a corporation for the negative externalities it produces, then return a verdict. The corporation and the CHPA would have one year to work out an agreement for how to amend the problem\u2014for example, Walmart could reduce food stamp usage by its employees by 50 percent in a way approved by the CHPA. If the corporation fails to amend the negative externality, the CHPA would have the power to suspend all stock buybacks and dividends\n\n&gt;Institute a carbon tax and dividend scheme, as proposed by Matthew Bruenig, with an initial price of $230 per ton of CO\u2082 (The amount would be indexed to inflation and might be raised in the future). All funds from this tax would be redistributed to households, with poorer households receiving a larger proportion of the tax.\nCooperate internationally to establishment of a single, harmonized international carbon trading market to replace the current regime of approximately 50 regional and national platforms that cover just 20 percent of man-made greenhouse gas emissions.\nPromote decentralised, mobile technology options to bring climate action to a mass market. Distributed ledger technologies including blockchain can \u2018democratise climate action\u2019 by empowering individual citizens, consumers, utilities, businesses (for instance, airlines) and public bodies to participate in carbon sequestration, offsetting and trading through digital tokens that are officially backed by recognized and audited carbon credits.\nEstablish a Green Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), as proposed by Matthew Bruenig. The Tennessee Valley Authority Act would be amended to expand the TVA beyond its current operating area, with the aim of decarbonizing all energy production by a certain date. In addition to congressional funding, the TVA could finance its decarbonization efforts with green power bonds guaranteed by the federal government.\nEnsure a \u201cjust transition\u201d economic guarantee for all communities negatively impacted by the pivot from fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy. \nInstitute a national Renewable Portfolio Standard, requiring all utility companies to receive a certain percentage of their energy from renewable sources each year. In the first year, this amount could be set at 15 or 20 percent; within twenty years, it would reach 100 percent.\nEnd subsidies and special tax breaks to fossil fuel companies while enacting just as aggressive or even more aggressive subsidies for renewable energy production: we cannot give special treatment to pollutants that threaten our planet.\nIntroduce a 50% levy on all bank loans to the fossil fuel industry.\nEliminate all single-use plastics to keep our oceans and landfills from choking with non-biodegradable matter, and our fossil fuels in the ground. Combine this with a push to eliminate all single-use packaging altogether by ensuring that it is 100 percent re-usable, recyclable or compostable.\nInstitute new local, state, and national transportation projects, focusing on electric vehicles and ease of transport. High-speed electric rail, electric buses, subways, and other projects can not only help the country reach net carbon-neutrality, but can also help address inequality: our entire country relies on expensive, polluting cars that many people cannot afford, and having cheap and reliable public transit can aid transportation to jobs and communities at low to no cost to our citizens. \nLower or altogether remove parking minimums for buildings, ensuring that we have more space for people rather than more space for cars. \nHelp rebuild our cities: use green and socially-conscious planning new zoning laws while abolishing old ones to ensure that cities are not class or race-segregated, have cheap and affordable public transit, have sustainable and green buildings, and feature public housing areas that ensure low-cost housing for all.\nModernise levees and related physical infrastructure to be climate- and disaster-resilient.\nLower or eliminate industrial animal agriculture subsidies while using these funds to subsidize independent, local meat and animal product replacements, whether in the form of simple vegetables, synthesized meat replacements like Beyond Beef, imitation meat, etc. \nCreate a national challenge account to promote citizen-based science, technology and innovation. incl. but not limited to clean renewables. Combine this with an enabling environment for science, technology and innovation, such as in the application of distributed ledger technologies to promote social, economic, cultural, civil and political inclusion.\nWork with the United Nations to create a tribunal for climate crimes. \n\n\n&gt;Re-establish banking services within post offices as Senator Kirsten Gillibrand has put forth, using our pre-existing nationwide infrastructure to benefit people in even more ways. Include no-cost checking and savings accounts.\nEstablish small-dollar loans through these public banks with small dollar amounts and tiny interest rates, allowing people to \nEnsure that municipal taxes flow through these public banks rather than coercive behemoths like Wells Fargo, making it so that interest and loans go towards the public good rather than the profit motive. \nUsing Germany\u2019s nation-building municipal banks as a model, along with North Dakota\u2019s profitable, beneficial state bank, fund major and minor infrastructure projects through loans made by public banks that consistently offer lower interest rates and more capital for these public-good projects. \n\n\n&gt;The United States should:\nRepatriate all wealth currently residing in off-shore tax havens and that are therefore avoiding taxation, with a one-time tax rate of 24 per cent.\nInstitute a tax on all financial transactions - a Tobin spot tax - on all speculative financial transactions, including but not limited to foreign exchange trading.\nMarginal tax of all income over $1 million at 60 percent, incomes over $5 million at 70 percent, incomes over $10 million at 80 percent, and incomes over $20 million at 95 percent.\nRaise the capital gains tax.\nEliminate all tax expenditures designed to benefit oil, gas, and coal companies. \nExplore a progressive tax on initial public offerings, to increase as the size of the IPO increases.\n\n\nAnd much much more!", "created_utc": 1563046482, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cctf8s/gravel_2020_platform_aka_rip_stock_market/", "is_self": true}
