{"id": "gh8jhf", "title": "AyyPce Charts - CAKE, LOGI, HD, more charts to come for 5-15 Week", "selftext": "Hey all, gonna start charting some in addition to the earnings dds i've been looking at. \n\n$LOGI\n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/x/lYyDVU8H\n\nAs you can see the multi year trendline going up to this top. We have crazy sold out products across the board, this thing can moon to heaven. Looking at the closer timeframes though, picture is supported, but cautious.\n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/x/6RKKwcuI\n\nHuge ascending triangle with a break. Wait for earnings and we can see it go up crazy or down harder. I personally see it more to the upside. Volume spiking into earnings . I see this as bullish , take it as you will. If it dies though, it has many levels to go down.\n\nEdit on LOGI: There can be a selloff tomorrow. If you want to be cheeky with a pre earnings play, buy at 9:30 ish, sell at 12 or after. I bet you make money :D \n\nZM also a great play off LOGI going up\n\n$CAKE \n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/x/7eDMVGNZ\n\nVery interesting levels with VERY high volume to focus on DURING these lows. Volume is heavy, and it is finally breaking upwards. Looks like it will pass this next test and go big. That is my focus for this upcoming move, will be looking to accumulate.\n\nI will update this as we go forward, but with news of reopening and you bet ya 99999% customer growth will moon this shit to the top.\n\nLong at any point.\n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/x/oyD7xfav/ \n\nThere is a broader ascending channel we might bounce off of, but we broke into that descending channel which I expect us to at LEAST hit the midpoint of.\n\n$HD\n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/i/Zk951opc/\n\nEarnings coming up, will likely run up into earnings but I can see a pullback this week. \nAt top of range but can breakthrough, keys to look at. It is at Top of BB band and has usually respected that. Healthy pullback very likely. Thing is though, post pullback, I believe we approach that 239 range and beat it. If we break, which is often what is occurring with HD , we likely go further and test ATH . Will follow up on this when the time comes. Check out the strength in this stock! Wait till pullback or set a buying area, I say between that buy zone I placed to begin accumulation.\n\nNEW!\n\n$CSCO\n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/x/iiU2Iap7/\n\nCSCO - Not really that bullish but I can see a strong earnings week. CSCO had a bullish engulfing last week, but has a lower high and a lower low. Very interesting, I say buy into earnings and then possibly just will bomb earnings regardless of expected gains.\n\n$SBUX\n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/x/eX8TvHaC/\n\nSBUX looks great here, fibs on two timeframes showing a big break up looking to occur. Big problem that you notice is many lower highs and lower lows (BA, SBUX, etc.). I believe SBUX looks to move upward, has had solid volume and project Make America Open Again will bring in some newspiece to have ears perk up. Be careful though, lower highs and lower lows makes it look not so great. \n\n$DIS\n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/i/XGDUr5WT/\n\nHas a lot of room to climb but next level is 116~. Can set an alert for the 113 break as 116 should have little trouble being broken. Volume growing here and sentiment is higher. They also survived a pretty horrible earnings so their value must be a bit higher. It broke into a strong fib level on Friday and closed above. Let's see what happens tomorrow but I'd be placing a bet on DIS soon myself.\n\n$WDAY in depth\n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/x/3xFkSolA/\n\nWDAY has earnings coming up and can see a large run up. May 28, 2020 is earnings, quite some time till then. Might cool down after the run up last week from Twilio but here are the key levels.\n\nIt just bounced off .618 Fib, and can pull back to 160 and 155. If 155 holds on strong volume, that signals accumulation to me. I'd say that if so, you can see a large move upwards back to 166 if not higher. After 166 comes 172 also near that 200 day MA. If it breaks above that, the bullish trend will resume and you can see 181, 201 breakouts into higher as we move into earnings. Take it a step at a time.\n\nLayers downward, if 155 breaks you can look for a potential short up to 144. It would be a drastic move as we have see each dip below 150 get bought, but it is not out of the realm of possibility. When it hits and breaks 144 though, that would look at a major trend continuation with rejection of all MAs, and it can be a short to 130, 120.56 and then even 108.54 if visiting the March lows. RSI moving quite high on the daily but it is not oversold per say. V Interesting.\n\nOn the weekly, higher highs and higher lows consistently. \n\n$TAK - Requested\n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/chart/qnKC8Gi9/\n\nnot gonna go too in depth but it respected mid BB, volume picked up last two days and is dwarfing the sellers. Weekly looks quite shit though, lower lows and lower highs by a large margin since last week, but it did respect .618. On Daily I'd say next move is 18.02 with the test of MAs. If it beats? I'd say next is 18.75. If it breaks this .618 though... could freefall to 16.42.\n\nMonthly actually looks more bullish though, could see this rise heavily. Broke multi year downward trend. This is one I'd focus on levels with and maybe get some leaps vs weekly trades.\n\n\n$LOW nother quickie\n\n\nLOW looks nuts\n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/x/PA0dthl9/\n\nbroke all MA's and mid BB. Might retest 108 though, but i'd look into buying on that mid bb support hold as this shit can moon to 126. calls. Earnings next week, premiums large but can run up large into those levels. Lets see what happens.\n\n\nMight post more just please request any!", "created_utc": 1589141394.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gh8jhf/ayypce_charts_cake_logi_hd_more_charts_to_come/", "is_self": true}
