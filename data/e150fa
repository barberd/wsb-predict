The concept of an options contract makes sense to me, but what I can't seem to under stand is how people lose so much money on them?\n\nCTN, who clearly borrowed money he didn't have (and died a hero) - his losing money makes sense. \n\nBut what about the rest of you? how does buying an option and it ending OTM put you at a negative balance? I understand that you lose the premium on every contract that goes tits up, but if you're buying without any leverage you should only be limited to losing the premium, right?\n\nCongrats on converting another to your ranks, in the meantime I would appreciate some advice. GE just hit its 52 week high and payday's this week, I'm tryna buy some puts and I'm wondering how much one stands to lose without leverage.", "created_utc": 1574630857, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e150fa/how_do_you_lose_so_much_money_on_options/", "is_self": true}
