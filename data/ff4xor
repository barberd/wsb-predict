{"id": "ff4xor", "title": "$SCI - Service Corporation International - Merchants of Death", "selftext": "$SCI is one of the largest companies in the death industry. They are a one-stop shop for the death industry, caskets, cremations, burials, you name it. \n\nThere are around 3 million deaths in the US normally every year.\n\nIf half of the population is infected with coronavirus, and just %1 of them die, then you can add a full 50% on to that number. If we go into recession, you can add more. It is estimated that the 2008 financial crisis may have caused an additional 500k cancer deaths from 2008-2010. We're positioned for even worse than that, since hospitals will be overtaxed in terms of ICU beds and workforce in general. \n\nSCI revenue grew just 3.65% y/y last quarter. This bump in revenue could be substantial in terms of EPS. \n\nIts a steady stock with relatively low volatility. Calls here could print big. \n\n\nThe options market for them kinda sucks, so ITM calls are probably the play here. $50 calls for september are trading at 5.55 right now. Pretty fucking cheap if it makes it to 60. Thing is, even without this virus it might have made it to 60 by then. \n\nBy the end of q2 they will be killing it, buying it, and putting a wreath on it. \n\nI will likely buy into September $50c next week.", "created_utc": 1583629794, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ff4xor/sci_service_corporation_international_merchants/", "is_self": true}
