{"id": "dc5ix3", "title": "Getting Technical: SPY DD(10/2/19)", "selftext": "Drill Spy the Buy Puts Guy here with some technical analysis on $SPY in preparation for Wedneaday, October 2nd. \n\n*Safety glasses on*\n.\nOn October 1st, $SPY(-1.19%) saw it's biggest one day drop in over a month off of weak manufacturing news.  President Tariff Man's outlook on trade talks has changed to a much more negative tone the past few tweets, and it seems the impeachmeant news has him thrown off his stonks game. \n\n    If he can regain his focus and use his tweets to pump efficiently, we may see SPY rebound by the EOW, but as of now, he seems more focused on attempted pumps on auto stocks nobody gives a fuck about. Unless Trump regains his true bull self, expect SPY to continue it's downtrend for the week considering there has been literally zero positive political or economic news this week. In other words, the stock market is ON FUCKING FIRE. \n\nAs for October 2nd, look for $SPY  to rally at open. If it breaks 294.25 early, expect a flat-to-mildly green day, before a big drop the rest of the week. On the opposite side, if we break through 293.00 on the downside, expect all hell to break loose and $SPY to close around 290. \n\nIn conclusion, barring Tariff man going full Bull Gang, expect another red day tomorrow because there is absolutely no fucking reason for a green day at all. Buy puts motherfuckers cause SPY is gonna DRILL! DRILL! DRILL!\n\n*Safety Glasses off*\n\nTLDR: $SPY is gonna DRILL! DRILL! DRILL! tomorrow. Buy puts it is free fucking money.", "created_utc": 1569991556, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dc5ix3/getting_technical_spy_dd10219/", "is_self": true}
