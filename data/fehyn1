{"id": "fehyn1", "title": "Emotion-Driven Trading: Making Plays Based on What the Masses Believe vs. What is the Most Likely Outcome. Banking Sector.", "selftext": "As the title implies, I'm looking to make moderately short term plays (2-4 weeks) based on what the general consensus believe as opposed to what fundamentals tell us. I'm hoping to start a discussion we can all benefit from. That brings us to banks.\n\nBanks are not nearly as leveraged during this crash as they were in 2008. Although it's understandable to think that the worst is yet to come, the banking sector is typically the first to fall during a sell-off and rebounds rather quickly. I'm looking at some banking ETFs, specifically KBWB &amp; IXG. \n\nWe hit highs in the S&amp;P 500 on 2/19, and lows on 2/28 (7 trading days later). Now 5 trading day later we've been mostly sideways with wild swings in either direction. WE KNOW THIS ISN'T ENOUGH TIME TO DECLARE A BOTTOM!. But that is not what mainstream America wants to believe. Most retail investors are looking for the following:\n\n1 - Coronavirus is treatable and we're well underway to mitigating disaster (which we are but it just hasn't been widely reported)\n\n2 - Daddy Donald and the USA has our back! America is stronger than ever\n\n3 - The residents of Cramerica start to dip their feet back in the market\n\nThere's no way the \"fake news\" media is going to continue to let this spiral and panic people. We just need the next biggest news story. Maybe it's the beginning of baseball or March Madness. As soon as something takes the place of Coronavirus, people will forget to wash their hands all together.\n\n**TL;DR: 3/20 or 4/17 calls on KBWB &amp; IXG.**", "created_utc": 1583520032, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fehyn1/emotiondriven_trading_making_plays_based_on_what/", "is_self": true}
