{"id": "bycppv", "title": "My top tier investing strategies: how to lose money the RIGHT way", "selftext": "Hello all,\n\nMany of you bang your heads against the wall trying to beat the market, trying to make profit.  Most of you lose money by making half-assed guesses on what's going to be the next big thing.  Undoubtedly, some of you are alcoholics that, in moments of drunken stupor, buy more TSLA stock thinking that the company won't go bankrupt.    \nYou're not doing it right.  Here are some helpful tips on deciding what stocks to by that will be more reliable than advice from strangers.  \n1.  TICKER SYMBOLS\n\nYour primary decision on whether to invest in a stock should be on whether or not you find the combination of letters that make up the stock ticker symbol aesthetically pleasing.  If you are going to gaze down at your phone or computer screen to watch numbers go up and down throughout the day, while a string of drool hangs from your gaping mouth, it's best you do so while looking at something that at least has aesthetic value.  It's no good to look at a stock all day and be disgusted by the letters of the symbol.\n\n2. PITY POINTS\n\nWhat if you feel really bad for a company, they're the little train that couldn't, they try and try and they just keep eating shit?  It's time to invest in GME, they work so hard and you feel so bad about that big red chart.  It brings a tear to your eye, thinking of how unwanted you were in childhood and how now this stock is as unwanted as you were and are.  You'll never find love, and you have so much love to give.  You should pour your love into the company stock that nobody else loves.\n\n3. SEEK FORTUNA'S FAVOR\n\nMany of you are screwing around with puts and calls without even giving the goddess her due.  That's bad form, and you are surely angering the already fickle goddess.  The original pantheon isn't gone--they're sleeping, but lady Fortuna offers her boon to the smart investor that seeks her guidance when dumping their entire life savings into a single penny cannabis stock.  A little known secret is that most successful day traders and financial gurus are in fact the remaining acolytes of the goddess Fortuna, worshipping her and keeping secrets in the dark all throughout history in order to tip the scales in their favor.  Before flirting with the dark art of options and losing the shirt off your back, proclaim loudly and proudly that you do this in the name of the glorious lady of chance and fate, that you put your trust in her hands and this is your offering to her.  \nWhether she listens to you and blesses you is simply up to chance.\n\n4. ALPHABET SOUP\n\nIf you've read the above tips and feel you need to \"diversify\" your \"portfolio\" further, simply go to the supermarket and buy the cheapest can of alphabet soup.  Pour it into a bowl, and mix thoroughly.  Separate the letters into as many groups as you can, between 2 and 4 letters preferably, and every one that corresponds to a stock ticker symbol are your next buys. Eat the soup, and no, you can't heat it up and eat it warm because you don't deserve it.", "created_utc": 1560028785, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bycppv/my_top_tier_investing_strategies_how_to_lose/", "is_self": true}
