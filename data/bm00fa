{"id": "bm00fa", "title": "LYFT", "selftext": "Lyft Inc. exceeded analysts\u2019 sales expectations and assured investors that its hefty losses will decrease next year. They projected second-quarter revenue of $800 million to $810 million. Analysts were expecting $782 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales grew 95 percent to $776 million in the first quarter, beating estimates by $38 million.\n\nLyft also reported an eye-popping net loss of $1.14 billion in the quarter, which was larger than the company\u2019s loss for the entire year of 2018. Most of the costs were attributed to stock-based compensation and expenses tied to the initial public offering, but the numbers still unnerved some investors.\n\nShares are down 18 percent from the March IPO price. On a conference call after the report, Chief Financial Officer Brian Roberts said 2019 would be the peak year for losses, reiterating what executives said during the IPO roadshow. The report suggests intense competition with Uber Technologies Inc. in the ride-hailing market will continue, at least through the end of the year. Lyft projected a loss before interest, taxes and other expenses of as much as $1.18 billion for 2019. It anticipates sales of $3.28 billion to $3.3 billion for the year, which is above estimates.\n\nFor reference, Uber had estimated about $3 billion in revenue in the first quarter, up 19 percent from a year before. Today, Uber had enough demand to price its IPO shares at the top of its current range. Uber is expected to price Thursday and begin trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, in what\u2019s expected to be the biggest U.S. IPO in years. \n\nIn its financial statement, Lyft said active riders climbed 46 percent to 20.5 million. Meanwhile, revenue per active rider increased 34 percent to $37.86. Lyft didn\u2019t disclose gross bookings this quarter, eliminating one measure investors have used to compare the business to Uber\u2019s. Lyft had shared an annual number in its IPO filing. Lyft used the occasion to tout a new agreement with Waymo. The Alphabet Inc. unit will deploy 10 autonomous vehicles near Phoenix in the next few months for customers to book through the Lyft app.", "created_utc": 1557283869, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bm00fa/lyft/", "is_self": true}
