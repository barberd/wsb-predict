I already bought 6 MSFT calls , (3) $170 strike and (3) $175 strike. I want to know what you guys think on holding these calls vs 1 TSLA call for $720 strike. The both cost around the same and I'm bullish on both. I just fell that the TSLA call is a bit more risky but also there's a chance of making much more money. Let me know what you guys think\n\n[Positions](https://i.imgur.com/BoGWH6l.jpg)", "created_utc": 1580570470, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ex7kcy/msft_or_tsla/", "is_self": true}
