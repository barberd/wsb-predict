{"id": "fj6lg1", "title": "Corona US estimates compared to Italy/the world", "selftext": "As of 3/15 2:48 PM the website worldometersinfo has shown that the US has a 10 out of every 1million (or 10/1M ppl) infection rate while Italy reports 409.3/1Mil. I entertained the idea that we could currently have or if not soon have half the infection rate of Italy and our testing simply hasn't been happening in the numbers to show it. This would correlate to roughly 20x the US's actual reported cases which would bring our current 3,324 reported cases to approx 67k. Also I entertained the idea that the world currently has a population of approx 7.53 billion and total cases reported to date are 167,676 this equals .00002227% total infection rate which sounds sooooo low but then you convert that to # people infected globally per million and you reach 22.26/1M which is 2.26 x the # that the US   \n has currently reported. One can then summarize that if Italy has a 409.3/1M, China has 56.2/1M, also worth noting Spain and Iran currently sit above 165/1M that not only are global #'s either likely to rise tremendously due to spread and further testing but also that China may have drastically under-reported their casualties, and once again the the US's #'s are going to potentially be much higher in a short time frame as drive-thru ensues. Sorry for the cadence of all of this I'm an hour before going off to work  so I can catch Corona while serving these dumb MF's in South Florida bc Corona's just some media hoax NBD. Stay safe all and lemme know what you think this is my first post to WSB and I love this place.   \n\n\nSource:  [https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)    \nand my calculator", "created_utc": 1584299309.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fj6lg1/corona_us_estimates_compared_to_italythe_world/", "is_self": true}
