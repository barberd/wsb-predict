{"id": "dtl5oa", "title": "Robinhood Engineering: Interview 1 Update", "selftext": "As some of you may know before I took the post down, I was contacted by the Robinhood Engineering team, most likely because a recent post of mine was in yesterday\u2019s Bloomberg article and they said they liked my API/CLI tool which was linked to that post. I currently work as a dev for a metals trading company, previously worked for Yahoo, but am considering the job and moving forward. Today\u2019s interview went well, sounds like a good place to work and what not and they actually have a lot of ex Facebook and Google devs which is impressive. I still have another phone interview and then would have to do a technical interview in Cali. My goal is to make the team and represent r/WSB so that we can all ascend together to the land of milk and tendies.
