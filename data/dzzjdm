I don\u2019t have any extra space in my garage to buy one- but I think it\u2019s awesome. I remember going to car shows when I was younger and always seeing the beautiful \u201cprototype\u201d cars that the big car companies would put out just to tease us, but would never actually mass produce. FINALLY a car company is willing to put out something different than the usual boring shit we get from Ford, Honda, etc. if My PTON calls work out and I make enough money to become a gentleman farmer, you best believe I will be driving a Cybrtrk to Tractor Supply to pick up goat feed and flannel shirts on the weekends. \n\n\ud83c\udfa4 dropped", "created_utc": 1574420839, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dzzjdm/teslas_cybertrk_i_love_it_even_the_broken_windows/", "is_self": true}
