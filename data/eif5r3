Naturally, I\u2019m just thinking stocks and the losses I experienced recently. But I\u2019m here on their outside couch by their outside fireplace listening to deadmau5 on their outdoor surround sound system and it\u2019s so fucking silicon valley. They\u2019re talking about what we gotta do in an apocalypse and how they can mount speakers on the roof of their teslas to blast house music. Little do they know that when we get hyperinflation and the dollar collapses in the 2020s, they\u2019re gonna think back to this night and what they will need in the monetary apocalypse. While their portfolios made up of SPOT, AAPL, SNAP, PTON, SBUX, and LULU tank, I\u2019ll be sitting pretty with GLD, USLV, UVXY, and yea, some losses in NIO cause i\u2019m still a gambling man. \u201chindsight 2020\u201d they\u2019ll say with a sigh as they lay down on their waterbed in 2026. And the autists of wsb will reign supreme over what remains of financial assets.\n\nor SPX will moon to 10000 by 2030 and i\u2019ll be shooting up on the streets of SF, whatever alright my mom says i gotta socialize so happy new year! 2020 here we comeeee!", "created_utc": 1577860327, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eif5r3/theyre_gonna_call_it_the_hindsight_2020s/", "is_self": true}
