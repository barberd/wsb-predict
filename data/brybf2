Did some digging, and found that Oppenheimer has absolutely no shame.\n\n4/10/2019 - Outlook Therapeutics (OTLK) prices an offering of stock and warrants at $2.75 a share, with warrants that can automatically be exercised at $2.90 per share as soon as the stock price exceeds $2.90. Oppenheimer is the underwriter for this offering.\n\n4/11/2019 - 5/15/2019 - Stock immediately drops down to less than $2 a share, then slips down to $0.91 over the next month.\n\n5/16/2019 - Immediately after their fairly uneventful earnings press release, Oppenheimer realizes that they need to throw their buddies a bone, and puts a fucking $12 price target on this $0.91 cent penny stock ($14m market cap).\n\n5/16/2019 - 5/21/2019 - OTLK TRIPLES in market value, to just above $3.12 a share. Note that this is conveniently just above the $2.90 warrant price.\n\n5/22/2019 - Like clockwork, this shit-tier biotech loses 15% today.\n\n**Oppenheimer has no shame.** Also, don't buy OTLK, wet-AMD trials fail all the fucking time.", "created_utc": 1558582225, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/brybf2/a_casual_case_of_market_manipulation_by/", "is_self": true}
