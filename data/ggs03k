You know what that means? No one knows what this company is going to do after earnings considering the minuscule amount of earnings data that exists. \n\nThey got smashed by the Rona like everyone else combined with some bad news about people suing them and legality issues but who cares right, not like we are long term investors. \n\nAlso, did I mention 53% of the float are shorted so Squeeze potential (Ahem Wayfair), is highly likely if earnings beat,\n\nSo will their earnings beat? I have no idea tbh but I do know they have deals with insurance companies now and will be giving good guidance meaning more sales and more $$$. \n\nWhat happened over the last few weeks? SDC rallied up to $8 resistance and couldn\u2019t break it, finally broke yesterday verifying a cup and handle formation. \n\nWhen it pops its gonna pop damn big, risk 1x to make 10x, I\u2019m in. \n\n\nTLDR: If you want to play the run-up and sell before earnings for a quick 200% 5/22 10.5c\n10 bagger potential\n5/22 12c\n5/22 12.5c", "created_utc": 1589073401.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ggs03k/smile_direct_club_sdc_and_why_this_is_the_next_10/", "is_self": true}
