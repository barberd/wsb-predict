Want to see if there is a consenting group to play games with this", "selftext": "Netflix\u2019s current subscriber count is ~139 million active paid subscribers. Last they reported, they had a healthy buffer of about 7 million subs signed to the 30-day trial. They\u2019ll retain some percent of this. Honestly, I haven\u2019t found a a number for how much they retain each quarter but 7 million sounds like a cushy cushion to me. \n\nNetflix reports Q1 earnings mid-April. Revised estimates expect to Netflix to come in at ~148 million PAID subscribers. I myself thought this was a stretch, but Netflix and the street feels fairly comfortable that they\u2019ll do it. \n\nI looked deeper into at what Netflix was doing in India. Turns out only 500,000 of NFLXs mammoth subscriber count comes from India. They\u2019ve been in India for 2 years now. And it\u2019s not because streaming didn\u2019t take off. The leading streamer, Hotstar (DIS owned) has &gt;50 million subscribers. \n\nThe reasons for why this is and how Netflix is addressing it are not important now. \n\nOver the last ~4 months they started to run a pan-India promo which closes around this Q1 earning cycle. \u2018Airtel\u2019, India\u2019s largest telecom provider by subs (330 million active subs) partnered with Netflix to give 3 months of free Netflix for having (not new sign-ups, HAVING) a post-paid connection with Airtel. Gave all of them instructions on how to sign up and picked up the check. My dad said, \u2018just remembered I need to sign up cos the promo is ending\u2019 \n\nMy theory is that Netflix comes out with blockbuster sub numbers. Not trying to say they signed 50 million people, but I think they are going to effing unexpectedly blow past the proverbial 150 million number and that\u2019s going to looks sexy af. \n\nAnd Reed is smart. He likes money. He sees the opportunity and I think they timed this on purpose. Take care of himself and the shareholders. \n\nAbout me: Netflix shareholder. Blind faith in its long term success which directly correlates to mine. \n\n\n", "created_utc": 1554228572, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b8mqvd/enough_dd_for_yolo_expecting_a_massive_subscriber/", "is_self": true}
