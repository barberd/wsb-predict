{"id": "gg3e52", "title": "Natural Gas Market Outlook going into May/June", "selftext": "So the Natural Gas futures market closed around its support for the front month contract today going into the weekend. This presents a unique opportunity going into May. As many may know from my other [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gczz67/intermediate_outlook_on_the_natural_gas_ng_market/)([s](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g239f4/natural_gas_ngk20_play_for_tomorrow_416/)) about Natural Gas futures, the market for the commodity has been experiencing severe demand destruction for the last month and a half, similar to the market for crude oil (WTI). The EIA released its usual [Natural Gas Storage report](http://ir.eia.gov/ngs/ngs.html) this last Thursday morning, indicating a three-digit build for the week ended measured in billion cubic feet. This was in alignment with expectations regarding the build, and it has been noted by multiple analysts that the Natural Gas market's downward finish this week was mostly due to the rerouting of gas production after an explosion at the Texas Eastern Transmission (Tetco) system (prices initially surged because traders figured gas production would be hindered; albeit not as much as they thought).\n\nSo, since the market demand is down, what are the producers going to do about it that hasn't been baked into the trading entirely? Mass production shut-ins are anticipated by many analysts which could see a price for Natural Gas higher than $2.10/mmbtu by the end of the month, according to [Natural Gas Intel](https://www.naturalgasintel.com/articles/121931-natural-gas-forward-prices-find-footing-despite-continued-volatility-uncertainty) (NGI). Various analytics groups including EBW have pointed to \"steep declines\" in Natural Gas output for the coming weeks as producers continue to cut back to combat the demand destruction. These declines have been in alignment with various models thus far. In addition, 'net short' positions for Natural Gas futures became 'net long' recently, according to the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rising-natural-gas-prices-are-a-hot-bet-11588339279) mentioning that speculative bets that were \"very bearish\" in the last month or so, have been completely unwound now.\n\nBroader market implications in the energy industry could have bearing on the price of Natural Gas in the next couple months as well, according to [NGI](https://www.naturalgasintel.com/articles/121934-global-oil-supply-cuts-now-seen-reaching-17-million-bd-in-2q). Analysts are predicting the largest liquid oil shut-in in the energy industry's history during Q2, mostly driven by OPEC, Russia, and North America. A broad reduction in crude oil production will severely limit Natural Gas production, as much of it is a byproduct of WTI. As the energy producers continue to react to the COVID-19 environment and reduced demand, energy prices should continue to see overall growth in the next month despite the volatility of the markets. This has already been evidenced by the front month crude oil (CL) and Natural Gas (NG) contracts rising significantly since crude oil was negative momentarily last month.\n\n*Position Disclaimer: Currently long* [two NYMEX Natural Gas June contracts](https://imgur.com/a/NkMLmlc) *(NGM20) going into Sunday.*\n\nTL;DR $UNG Calls or Put Credit Spread (or naked Puts for those risk loving autists) for the options players.
