How's he going to stay swole and become the God of Gains during lock down?  Bowflex. That's right, the all in one machine from the 90's is back, and you never have to go to the gym again. Just look at the search comparing the search Peloton and Bowflex over the last 90 days:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i77738wfc1v41.png?width=1443&format=png&auto=webp&s=933ab8e42b9dc0b0dba38cf2d94e81c9dea77f7a\n\nSo searches for Bowflex are now at the same level as Peloton was before the lock down.  \n\nBut that's not all folks. The Peloton Bike is fucking expensive, so people turn to the digital subscription and a solid stand alone bike.  So people turn to many companies, but many are going for the Schwinn IC4 which is sold specifically as a way to connect to the Peloton App while spending less on the bike.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xu3s1e2re1v41.png?width=1461&format=png&auto=webp&s=d138626036ecf18122d44d004e29eaba4864d54c\n\nWhile not as pronounced Schwinn searches have been steadily going up for the last few months and is now at the same level as Peloton was pre-covid lock down. \n\nSo lets just look at the relative market cap - Peloton is pushing a $9B market cap, while the owner of both Bowflex and Schwinn, Nautilus $nls, is sitting under $200M.   \n\nAre they comparative companies?  No, Peloton is Subscription Driven, Nautilus is equipment driven. However, Nautilus is getting windfall for the same reasons that Pelton is. Q4 2019 had an estimated EPS of -.18, and it had a surprise EPS of .12. \n\nIts been a depressed stock for ages as it was a failing company.   It just got to its 52 week high, but there's a lot of room to grow.  \n\nI am a moron, probably don't listen to me.  Q1 Earnings Call is on 5-5, it will cautiously rise until then, and I expect a pretty large surprise to the expected EPS of -.14. \n\n$7.50 5/15C - They're still cheap.", "created_utc": 1587853014.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g82jn7/a_shitty_dd_for_nautilus/", "is_self": true}
