Debit $939.\n2) sell 6/19 20p. Credit $1085\n\nOutcomes:\n1) If the stock stays below $20, you made $146 with no cost out of pocket. \n\n2) If option buyer exercises, you sell your shares for $20.\n\n3) If the stock goes up, you make money by buying back the put at a lower price and/or selling the stock at a higher price.\n\nDoes that cover all the bases or am I missing something?\n\nAlso, what requirements would your brokerage have for the duration of the position?", "created_utc": 1586143754.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fvrcpn/buy_the_stock_sell_the_itm_put/", "is_self": true}
