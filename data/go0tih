If Anaplan shows a beat on revenue and earnings this quarter they could perform similarly to DataDog (although they are in different lines of business both are technical solutions in high growth \"moat\" type markets).\n\nTrack Record:\n\nPosted about NLY $6.5 calls which went up 3x prior to earnings then fell on miss.

I think that exiting half of my position if that can cover my basis then riding with the remainder allows for a good risk/reward.", "created_utc": 1590081017.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/go0tih/plan_calls/", "is_self": true}
