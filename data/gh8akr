BYND is a stock that's been bullish lately and is something that has been included in a lot of peoples' plays on here. Now, it's obvious the primary appeal of BYND's products lies with vegan eggheads of people who want to jump on some kind of fad diet. But wait, there's more! These products also have an intrinsic value as replacements for meat products because they use a fraction of the water it takes to produce actual beef. One study found that the Beyond Burger requires 99 percent less water to produce than a real beef burger.\n\nIf you don't think that this provides value to their products, take it from the grand autismo himself, Dr. Michael Burry who told New York Magazine in 2015 that \"What became clear to me is that food is the way to invest in water,\" Though this quote is referring specifically to investing in farmlands that produce different crops that require a lot of water to grow, creating food products that use up less water will eventually become more of an asset as global water shortages spread. \n\nI'm not sure about the prospects of the stock's immediate short term performance, as it's probably due for an adjustment. I do think this is a stock that should proceed to gain value. Leaps should be a good play.
