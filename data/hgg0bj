{"id": "hgg0bj", "title": "Question on Options", "selftext": "I sold a couple of Iron condors. Both expired in the money today. However one of the puts in the NVAX iron condor was 40 c in the money but after hours NVAX has dropped another dollar so that its now 1.5 in the money. Can the buyer exercise the option without exercising the corresponding covering spread put and force me to buy the stock on Monday? I know that options are exercizable till 530 PM on Friday by calling the broker but this is a spread. Any idea how that works out?\n\nScreenshot of the position\n\nhttps://imgur.com/8lRo2kQ", "created_utc": 1593205416.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hgg0bj/question_on_options/", "is_self": true}
