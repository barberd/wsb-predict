Netflix has over 150 times more subscribers. While the monthly fee is lower, PTON's isn't that much higher and they have recently cut it. I could go on and on about their growth assumptions and how they're not even remotely realistic, but I can't get over how ridiculous the price looks.\n\nSo, can someone please explain to me how their stock price is even remotely justified? How is their price NOT going to crater eventually? They don't even have to fail as a company, the problem is with the stock price. There is absolutely no way they will continue growing to justify the price.\n\nLooking at the open interest on the Jan 2022 puts, I'd say maybe I'm not as retarded as I think.", "created_utc": 1575658248, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e72rni/explain_ptons_price_to_me_like_im_a_5_year_old/", "is_self": true}
