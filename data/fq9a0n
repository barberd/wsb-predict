It has been a wild ride with some serious dips and I certainly never expected to see >150,000% (Is this a record of some sort?) returns since I bought my first MSFT call back in the first week of February. I made the majority of my money on SPY puts over the past few weeks including 40k worth that I purchased yesterday and sold this morning at open. Best of luck to you all and I'll continue to lurk here. No current positions so don't come at me with that.\n\nPortfolio Pic:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/maQv6an\n\nEDIT 1:\n\nGenuinely curious if this is a percentage record of some sort, wouldn't mind a flair if so ;)\n\nEDIT 2:\nI will post past positions tomorrow, there are hundreds.\n\nEDIT 3:\nThanks for the gold! Still waiting on my flair tho, I know y'all are hard at work on it, great things take time.", "created_utc": 1585354324.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fq9a0n/cashed_out_from_61_to_95k_in_15_months/", "is_self": true}
