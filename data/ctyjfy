{"id": "ctyjfy", "title": "GPS(Gap) ER Calls", "selftext": "Summary: GPS expected EPS is 0.52 a full 30% less than last year's quarter. Although I think that they will go down from last year's quarter, 30% is extremely harsh and I expect an EPS of about 0.60-0.65.  \n\n\n1.Their online stores are up. Old Navy and Athleta both experience an increase in search results over this last quarter compared to last years quarter. Only Gap itself is down(-8% in search trends), but Old Navy(+1.2%), which constitutes a majority of their sales, and Athleta(+2.6%) are up.   \n\n\n2. Discount retailers like WMT and TGT have beat their earnings significantly. If other companies in the industry are any indicator of how companies do, then GPS will also beat earnings. Discount retailers are doing great right now and I would expect GPS to not do terribly.  \n\n\n3. Their aversion to China. In their Q1 guidance they stated that they will be moving their supply chain out of China. I think that they will most likely continue doing that(why wouldn't they) and will have strong guidance for this quarter as they won't be affected by tariffs(something that would seriously harm their already slim profit margins).  \n\n\n4. Gap would do well in a recession because they are a discount retailer. They were hit pretty bad during the last one, but if an upcoming recession were to happen, they would do better in it because they have significantly shifted further to discount clothing and consumer confidence is higher than last time. People still need clothes when they're poor and when they're poor they buy cheap clothes like perhaps from old navy.  \n\n\nBasically, their physical retail sector would have needed to crash like 40% for the surprise to be near 0. This is pretty unlikely and I think that they'll beat the expectations by like 0.10-0.15.  \n\n\nTLDR: GAP calls expiring tomorrow", "created_utc": 1566485648, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ctyjfy/gpsgap_er_calls/", "is_self": true}
