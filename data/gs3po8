I have been a bear since February 20th, and since about mid April I have been sitting on my hands on my gains from the big initial short. Yes, I\u2019m stupid, but like many others, this was my first time navigating a 30% decline in the stock market so I didn\u2019t have the macro view to see the upside recovery.\n\nLet me lay out some facts.\n\nI. The Economy is Fucked\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how you look at it. I\u2019m going to bring in an excerpt I wrote in response to someone the other day. \n\nMy two cents says the fed can\u2019t help us this time around. Unless they act now. Savings rate doubled in April from 7 to 13%, even if it comes back down to 10-11%, the economic impact is devastating. America runs on consumer spending (70% of gdp), so a 40% increase in savings rate would be murderous. On top of that, people and businesses are over levered because of the belief that our economy would continue to pump out strong numbers pre covid, so there will have to be some deleveraging that happens. Stanford released a study a few days ago predicting 42% of job losses are permanent, but let\u2019s be conservative and say it\u2019s 20%. That would put us at 8-10% unemployment, again affecting consumer spending. Credit card is through the roof, student debt is through the roof, mortgages aren\u2019t being paid on time, and jobs are probably not coming back. The Fed can buy up all the assets they want, the economy will be in tatters either way.\n\nNow, what can we do about it?\n\nIn my opinion, you go bottom up instead of the typical top down approach. The Fed prints money and increases the stimulus checks even more than they currently are. Make people feel fucking rich. Then, even if consumer savings rates stay the same at 10-11%, they will spend the rest of it and stimulate the economy. \n\nNext would be to bring jobs back home from abroad. Ironically, this is what Trump wanted all along and he might get the golden opportunity. 78% of americans recently surveyed said they would buy more expensive products if they were made in america, so bring manufacturing home.\n\nThe final step would be a massive infrastructure overhaul. I\u2019m talking the shit politicians have been talking about for years. Airports, roads, bridges, tunnels. All of it. Huge federal jobs program. This should help bring unemployment back down during the deleveraging while companies find their footing and new companies emerge. \n\nRemember, these are conservative estimates and a path I believe is the only way forward. If we don\u2019t take steps close to these or drastic steps in general, the devastation could be worse. I don\u2019t see a better case, but maybe there is one. \n\nFeel free to debunk anything I wrote.\n\nSo given all of that above (assuming someone in the comments doesn\u2019t completely make what I\u2019ve said above irrelevant), we still aren\u2019t anywhere in the short term. For all we know, the market could reach ATH in the next 2 weeks. \n\nThat\u2019s where part 2 comes in, and where things get interesting.\n\nII. The Social Unrest\n\nThe social unrest is here.\n\nYes, I am absolutely fucking insane. I have gone mad by all measures of the word. But if you care to hear why I believe this is the tipping point bear with me.\n\nGeorge Floyd.\n\nMinneapolis was an absolute disaster tonight, I watched a lot of it on live stream and parsed through hours of Twitter comments. These protests are not over. They are lined up to continue through the weekend. Here is why that matters (again, in my opinion): \n\n- 30 million unemployed (with little certainty of whether their jobs are coming back)\n\n- high debt levels across the board for american consumers\n\n- low income households are bearing the brunt of the pain (53% can\u2019t pay bills up from 44%, only 23% can survive 3 months on their savings)\n\nThese protests are going to become something more than BLM or Anti Cops, they have a lot of potential because of the amount of uncertainty in people\u2019s lives right now. People will go out and fight if they believe it is their only option, and when they see things like \u201cAMZN hits ATH\u201d or \u201cBezos cuts relief pay while he gains $30B\u201d, they get fucking pissed. Even though most of us here know Bezos isn\u2019t really gaining $30B, a lot of people don\u2019t understand that concept. These protests have to potential to be a massive, massive movement that will catch the attention of wall street and turn into an eat the rich movement. People are getting desperate.\n\nIII. Social Unrest + Economic Instability\n\nNow if you were to look back at any riots in recent history (last 30 years), you would find most of them have had little impact on the stock market. I would argue that most or all of those riots happened in times of relative economic stability. This time it\u2019s different, and if we use Hong Kong as a case study, the impacts are not negligible. \n\nProjected GDP Growth in HK 2020:\n-5.8%\n\nGDP Growth in HK 2010-2019 (average):\nBetween 2-5%\n\nPretty fucking bad, considering coronavirus wasn\u2019t even a thing when these projections came out.\n\nIf we have prolonged social unrest, we will be double fucked and it will really tank the markets, but I\u2019m not here to go off on that hypothetical. Let\u2019s get back to the focus.\n\nIV. Conclusion\n\nThese riots have the potential to instill the uncertainty that markets have needed to reverse course. Social instability is the one thing that can trump economic instability, and wall street can\u2019t ignore the two together. \n\nThese protests are going to bring back a level of instability and uncertainty to the markets, which I think will lead to a realization of the real lives of people across the country. This is just the spark that lights the fire, not the reason for the crash. The reason is still the fundamentals of the economy. The spark is the uncertainty that these protests will bring.\n\nAlso, Lil Yachty releases album tomorrow, so a crash is basically guaranteed.\n\nTLDR;\nProtests are going to bring back the uncertainty in the markets, gay bears will reign victorious again.", "created_utc": 1590661472.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gs3po8/if_youre_a_permabull_keep_scrolling_the_next_leg/", "is_self": true}
