There is still a ton of potential in this play, and room to climb, so don't worry, but had to get that out for the Retards that will come in and say great DD after it mooned, blah blah, fuck you. \n\nWhat is CHEWY?\nChewy operates in pet food, supplies, medications, health products and other pet services (whatever the fuck those are).\n\nChewy is one of the few stocks that didnt tank with Covid. \nOn Jan 1st 2020, their stock was at 29.62.\nOn March 12th they closed at 22.77, their lowest point this year. As we know the Market bottomed on the 23rd...\nAs of March 23rd, their stock was up to 32.14, higher than the beginning of the year....\n\nChewy has actually seen tremendous growth because of Covid and that has helped their stock to surge as more and more people turn to online ordering for their pet food. Also, as we all know, most white people care for their dogs more than other people, we even let them sleep in the bed. So naturally, they were well taken care of and that included medications and food, from Chewy.\n\"According to Packaged Facts, approximately 90% of dog owners and 86% of cat owners in 2018 considered their pets to be a part of their family.\" - Probs all white people surveyed cause we are GAY - Fuck cats tho\n\nNow some growth for Chewy:\nFrom Forbes: https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanverdon/2020/04/02/pet-retailer-chewy-well-positioned-to-benefit-from-surge-in-online-demand/#4f5fb04c5d7f\n\n\"Online pet retailer Chewy didn\u2019t wow Wall Street with the fourth quarter results it released today, but the surge in demand it is seeing right now makes it well positioned to weather the coronavirus crisis.\n\nChewy is hiring between 6,000 and 10,000 employees at its fulfillment centers to handle a spike in orders, both from existing customers who are stockpiling pet food and supplies, and new customers, CEO Sumit Singh told investors in a conference call following the results release today after the market closed.\"\n\n\"For the fourth quarter of 2019, the results reported today were largely in line with expectations, with sales for the quarter up 34.7% over the prior year, at $1.35 billion and a net loss of $60.9 million, which included share-based compensation of $45.9 million.\n\nThose results include sales through Feb. 2, the last day of the fourth quarter, and don\u2019t reflect the surge Chewy has been experiencing since the coronavirus crisis hit.\"\n\nNone of the Covid surge has been reflected in previous earnings, so hold on tight boys. \n\nThey are hiring like crazy, meaning sales are through the roof. They have an expected EPS of (.01), thats negative .01 for the retards. \n\nNow naturally, and as the Forbes article explains, with hiring comes costs, such as labor costs, and of course there are more sanitation costs for COVID. But, outlook is supreme right now, and the view of them surging and revenue will be insane. \n\nTheir Sales have climbed from 2 Billion to 3.5 to 4.8 Billion from 17 - 19. They have of course been operating at a net loss, since inception, but that is shrinking every year, down to -252 Million for the end of 19. \t\n\nThey also have great customer retention and are increasing $ per customer every year, and I have to imagine that climbs for the last quarter. \nTheir customer base has gone from 6.7 Million to 13.5 million from 17 - 19. \nTheir net sales per customer is up from $310 to $360 in that same time frame, and their autoship keeps climbing, going from 61% of sales to 69% of sales.\n\nThese are all really good signs, and last quarter should be even higher. \n\nThis stock has a lot of potential long term. Brick and Mortar stores are already in trouble. Covid has accelerated this concern, and Chewy is benefiting BIGLY. My price target for earnings is 45 strike price, but long term, for the few of you idiots who can look long term or buy farther out strike prices, this has upwards of $50 potential end of year (IMO).\n\nTL:DR:\nChewy goes up BIGLY. \nPositions:\nCHWY 6/19 45C\n170 Shares of EVRI\nEVRI 6/19 10C (I moved up from the 7.5C I posted yesterday, but may move back down depending on volume, as I'm not liking the 10 as much). I'd Recommend 7.5 C still\n\nGood Luck and may the Tendies print in your favor", "created_utc": 1590163013.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/golxhp/chwy_earnings_play_for_69/", "is_self": true}
