This is often due to certain members of the community posting legit DD once in a while and the rest of us autismos following blindly (usually with some measure of success).\n\nThe key is to identify who these quality posters are. Obviously without backing it up with actual positions, DD is useless but there must be some ways to identify/ flair quality members so that we\u2019re able to move more cohesively as a herd/sleuth (names for groups of bulls/bears respectively). \n\nExamples of DD backed up by positions is that bank DD on the repo market the other day that was quality stuff.\n\n\nOpen to ideas.", "created_utc": 1583782152, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fg090t/wsb_the_individual_vs_the_collective/", "is_self": true}
