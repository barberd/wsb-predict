{"id": "bay6z3", "title": "Argument for DIS", "selftext": "less versed in company fundamentals, but here is argument for DIS calls.\n\nWould love to hear some opposition to this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStreaming Platform:\n\nInvestor day is Thursday, April 11th. This should increase volatility regardless of what they are showing, but it happens to be all but confirmed that they will be showcasing Disney+ streaming platform.\n\nNow, this is not entirely revolutionary platform as they already have established ESPN+, but it provides strategic advantage to DIS as it will hold existing as well as potential content that competitors such as Apple, Netflix, CBS, etc cannot. And yes they have already announced plans to remove their existing content from Netflix. Personally, I have no idea why they are not presenting unified platform with all content or even piping all these services through Hulu (which they own majority stake in), but I suspect this is a future play for them.\n\nBased on AAPL announcement, stock rose 8% (month of March alone) and is continuing to go up (\\~12%). Apples compelling argument is bundling service packages. No content specific buzz that I am aware of as of now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEndGame (movie):\n\nRight off the bat, Avengers Endgame is already crushing records on presales and managed to cause outages on Fandango and AMC sites. I wasn't versed in how stock reacts to movie releases so I just looked at stock reaction after their major blockbusters released just to see if their is any correlation. I am choosing highest grossing blockbusters as my assumption is EndGame will easily fit in that category. I'd like to normalize numbers in a way that includes hype up to move as I believe a lot of the times stock price reacts well before movie is release, but this is what I'm going with for now.\n\n**Movie/Gross Earnings/Release Date/$DIS Stock Movement 2 Weeks After Release**\n\n* Star Wars Force Awakens / $247,966,675 / 12.18.15 / (-1%)\n* Black Panther / $202,003,951 / 2.16.18 / (+1%)\n* Avengers: Infinity War / $257,698,183 / 4.27.18 / (+3%)\n* Marvel's The Avengers / $207,438,708 / 5.4.12 / (+3%)\n* Star Wars The Last Jedi / $220,009,584 / 12.15.17 / (+3%)\n* Incredibles 2 / $182,687,905 / 6.15.18 / (+1%)\n\nBased on numbers, there is a slight lift. Not completely significant, but again my expectation is that End Game blows these records out of water. That and the combined news of streaming should move stock up significantly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCouple things to call out that I have not researched as much:\n\n* Park revenue: have not even looked into this in anyway\n* Q1 Guidance from DIS: they have already said Q1 earnings (May 8(?)) will be lower as they plan to invest in streaming platform\n* Movie net revenue: though I expect the new EndGame movie to crush gross income record, I also know they are floating around a $500M cost of making this one and the last one. Will probably look into net profit as an indicator next.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me know thoughts on this and anything else you think I should look into for analysis.\n\nEither way, I have no idea why stock is staying flat. Would love insight there.", "created_utc": 1554752714, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bay6z3/argument_for_dis/", "is_self": true}
