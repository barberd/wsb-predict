{"id": "cild61", "title": "i analyze IWM so you don't have to", "selftext": "IWM is a the RUSSELL 2000 ETF made up of small caps. It's super liquid like SPY (but SPY is made up of big caps). \n\nAnyway, if the FED cuts rates by 50bps, IWM is going to fly past 160. If the FED cuts rates by 25bps, I think IWM will still hike, at least to 160. Small caps will fly because they arguably stand to benefit the most from rate cuts because small businesses often are very dependent on debt for growth. \n\nWeekly chart: 160 is the holy belogna of resistances: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/abDYS09F/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/abDYS09F/)IWM has broken 160 only once, in May 2018. The ATH is 173. IWM is lagging SPY big time; if it were trading like SPY, it would be above 173 by now. The theory is that if the FED cuts 50bps, IWM will FLY to 173 FAST and FURIOUS. It has been consolidating since jan 30. \n\nDaily: just broke out of a *textbook* bull flag, then retested the top of the flag, and bounced. Ready to break out and FLY to 160. [https://www.tradingview.com/x/7f6T5F0y/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/7f6T5F0y/)MACD golden cross and 5ma/10ma daily golden cross. this thing is set to fly. My guess is that IWM will go ahead and climb to 158 (next resistance) on monday.\n\n**The play:** anything long. But let me tell you where the BIG BOY MONEY interest lies: **8/16 165c.** This option has 51000--51k!!!-- open interest. On Friday alone 20264--20k!--of these calls were purchased. They're on sale for just 0.15 right now.  lol. \n\nI plan to buy 100 of these at 0.15 (if that's possible) monday morning. All in $1500. My limit/stop loss is 0.12 (meaning, i'll sell out if it drops to 0.12 and lose $300). To speculate, suppose it is announced FED cuts rates of 50pbs on Tuesday, I think IWM will blast through 160 on Tuesday. The next resistance level is 162.30ish. So let's suppose IWM gets to 162.30 (to be more conservative) by Friday with FED rate cut, those 8/16 165c's should be around 0.9, for a profit of about 7.5k. More conservatively, if IWM gets to 161 by Friday, the 8/2 165c's should be at least 0.75, so 6k profit. \n\nI also plan to buy 1 Jan 2020 160c for 5.30ish on Monday morning.", "created_utc": 1564253638, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cild61/i_analyze_iwm_so_you_dont_have_to/", "is_self": true}
