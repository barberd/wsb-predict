This shit is about to moon.\n\n1. Virtu is a market maker. They thrive in periods of market volatility. They reached their all-time high in 04/2018 @ 37. They broke out from $12 in 01/2018 to $28 in 02/2018 and then $37 in 04/18. Almost 3x their price in a 2-3 month stretch.\n\nWhat was SPY doing from 01-04/2018? It was fucking tanking. It was a period of incredibly volatile. Comparing the SPY 500 to $VIRT reveals that periods of volatility, and especially downward direction of the SPY, resulted in $VIRT breaking out.\n\n$VIRT appears to inverse SPY when it comes to dramatic movements. When SPY goes down, VIRT goes up.\n\n2) This is confirmed almost to the dot when we compare $VIRT to the VIX. **Guess when the last time the VIX spiked at the levels we are seeing now? 02/2018.\u00a0The current market looks like a fucking cake walk in comparison to 2018. $VIRT Is going to moon.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[VIX chart, look at the beginning of 2018](https://preview.redd.it/vnvizdfs9pl41.png?width=1189&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2cfb5615bd317ab538b889f336c4ce9030b2062)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[VIRT chart, spike is from early 2018](https://preview.redd.it/hu6qb5gu9pl41.png?width=1189&format=png&auto=webp&s=e90b2de76f10827d4ea0c072b8ad91b372b4af7c)\n\n3) $VIRT has a tendency to revise guidance early. ***They have already upped their guidance for the first two months of 2020 on 03/05/2020 and I full expect them to revise it up again in the beginning of April.***\n\n**$VIRT thrives in period of volatility, this is the time to buy before it goes ape-shit when they revise their earnings.  Buy calls on $VIRT 04/17 @ 30 and @ 35.**\n\nLet's get them tendies.\n\nEDIT: Positions are 10 contracts at @30 for 04/17 and then 15 @ 35.
