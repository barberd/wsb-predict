Space is a neat stock that is capturing a good amount of market share against 2 other competitors (Blue origins and SpaceX). \n\nWhile I think there is money to be made, and as I am speaking, my April and Jan 2020 leaps are pulling in so much profit (\\~400% and 250% respectively), I don't think the jump is justified. I will be exiting the position to see what this stock is really valued at come Feb 20th. \n\nFor a company that is working towards this industry, with no definitive statistics or projected numbers, I can't see how it can be a $4B company. That's about as ridiculous as opening up pop up store with no customers and saying it's worth about tree fiddy thousand. \n\nPoint is, and I hate to say it, people out here on WSB can only tell you speculative opportunities with this company and will only give you info on what they are doing to set footing. There are no definitive ways to measure this company and that's why it's such an easy stock to pump. From $7-28 in 3 months with no media coverage, no talks by the CEO, and an upcoming presentation on the 20th is hard to digest. \n\nTLDR: I'm a bull, but it hasn't proved anything and just a fair warning. Be patient with this one.
