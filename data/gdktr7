{"id": "gdktr7", "title": "[Serious] Understanding WHY tanker companies like STNG and DHT are attractive buys (and NAT is not)", "selftext": "There was a post yesterday with loads of 'DD' discussing tanker companies and why they're attractive targets going in to earnings, etc.  Unfortunately this post (  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gd01t7/serious\\_on\\_the\\_oil\\_demand\\_crisis\\_and\\_why\\_you/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gd01t7/serious_on_the_oil_demand_crisis_and_why_you/)  ) is laden with misinformation and demonstrates a clear lack of understanding about what has been driving the freight markets and why certain tanker companies are positioned to do well going forward.\n\nSome key things we'll go over that you need to understand are:  floating storage economics,  contango in the forward curve (for crude and gasoil aka. distillate),  scrubber saturation across a tanker fleet and the price differential between IMO 2020 compliant marine fuel and pre-2020 compliant fuel oil.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDefinitions:\n\nContango:  where the nearby price of a future is less than that of the next one. I.E.  July brent settled at 27.20 today where August was 28.68, so the Jul/Aug spread settled at -1.48/bbl.\n\nForward freight curve:  these are the prices that you can trade for forward freight prices.  \n\nFloating storage:  where the company/trader booking the vessel has no intent of actually shipping anything on it, they are booking the vessel to store crude/product on it because the contango market structure allows them to collect more money rolling their physical length down the curve than the ship costs.  \n\nExample of floating storage economics:   Using the -1.48 Jul/Aug brent spread as an example; if you could book a 1,000kb (1 million bbls) ship that costs you $33,000/day, you book it, load it with spot crude, and buy the jul/aug spread at -1.48.  Then you can turn around and sell that crude in August.   So 33k/day \\* 30 days = $990k for the boat,  you're collecting $1.48/bbl in contango, on 1mil bbls, = $1.48m.  So before TVM and operational costs, you're looking at tidy $490k profit for putting your oil on a boat on month and taking it off the boat next month.\n\nIMO 2020:    As of January 1st, all vessels at sea had to start burning a lower sulphur fuel oil (sulphur = S going forward) .  Prior to this, you could burn fuel that had up to 3.5%S,  now (Jan 1) you can only burn fuel that has 0.5%S.  Guess what, 0.5%S costs way more to blend than 3.5%S.  Let's call the spread between 0.5%S and 3.5%S the 'scrubber advantage', the wider this spread, the bigger advantage a scrubber fleet has over non-scrubber fleets.\n\nScrubbers:  Scrubbers are devices that are installed on the exhaust stacks of tankers.  These nifty devices allow a ship to burn non-compliant fuel oil.  I.E. you can still buy the 3.5%S fuel because the scrubber cleans the exhaust so the emission looks like you're burning 0.5%S.  \n\nScrubber saturation:  what % of a tanker company's fleet has scrubbers installed, allowing them to use cheaper fuel than a company that has no scrubbers.\n\nOne more definition for you,  is the TD3 freight future.  This is a good benchmark to look at for large tanker dirty freight around the globe.  It is the rate that the Baltic Exchange publishes every day for the freight route from Middle East Gulf to China for 270,000 metric ton cargoes.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow that we have those definitions out of the way, let's try to understand why STNG has moved the way it has since the beginning of the year until now.  Please pull up the following charts:\n\nRolling front TD3 contract:   [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=NYMEX:TL1!](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=NYMEX:TL1!) \n\nRolling front month Brent vs Dec '20 spread:   [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=ICEEUR:BRN1!-ICEEUR:BRNZ2020](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=ICEEUR:BRN1!-ICEEUR:BRNZ2020) \n\nRolling front month 0.5% vs 3.5% fuel oil differential (i.e. scrubber spread):  [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=NYMEX:R531!](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=NYMEX:R531!) \n\nNAT:   [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=NYSE:NAT](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=NYSE:NAT) \n\nSTNG:  [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=NYSE:STNG](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=NYSE:STNG) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's talk about January through to the first week of March.  COVID is fucking things up across the globe, refineries are producing 0.5%S fuel oil to meet anticipated demand for the new IMO 2020 compliant fuel (that no one really needs now because shipping demand sucks) and freight rates are falling because there is greatly reduced shipping demand.  \n\nSo for Jan 1 through to the first week of March:\n\n\u2022TD3 / freight rates are falling\n\n\u2022scrubber spread is dropping \n\n\u2022crude spreads aren't yet at floating storage levels.  \n\nThis means tanker companies are going to suffer, and they sure do reflect that.  Why does STNG drop off more than NAT?  Because of the scrubber spread.  Their price advantage of having a huge amount of scrubbers installed across their fleet has gone from over $200/mt to $120/mt.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEnter the Saudi/Russia price war.   On March 5th Opec had a meeting in Vienna where they decided to cut production, so long as Russia and other non-OPEC members of 'OPEC+' agreed to do so.  On March 6th, Russia rejected this demand, and on March 8th, SA announced they would INCREASE their production.  This price war resulted in crude oil prices, and more importantly for the tanker market, crude spreads got demolished.   Take a look at the rolling front month vs. Dec '20 brent chart you have open and look at what happened after March 6th.  We went from around -1/bbl contango to -8.60/bbl contango over the course of just a few trading sessions.  Now look at your TD3 / freight chart and you'll see freight rates ripped in that same time period.  This is because traders around the world were locking in floating storage plays, not because of any actual shipping demand.  These floating storage plays continued for quite some time.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs you'd expect, tanker companies start to appreciate and resist the macro sell-off that was happening from March 1st to the 23rd.  While they were jumping as much as freight rates, look at SPX in that time period and they were doing quite well against the indices.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCrude spreads saw a huge recovery in early April, and as you'd expect, freight rates dropped as no one was booking ships for floating storage and actual shipping demand was hard to find at such inflated freight levels.  No fear, brent spreads were to shit the bed again through to April 22nd which was our recent bottom.  And look at your freight chart,  that was the recent high on TD3.  As the crude contango makes floating storage plays un-economical, that means we need to return to a shipping market that is relying on actual shipping demand, not floating storage econs.  \n\nGuess what, the world is still fucked with COVID, and while many think we are on the other side of it, shipping demand still isn't close to what it was pre-COVID.  \n\nAs to why STNG hasn't recovered the same way NAT has, again we look at the scrubber spread.  The scrubbers that were installed were done so at fixed cost.  So that price advantage of $60/mt instead of $200/mt means it will take that much longer for STNG to pay off the scrubber installation in the first place.\n\nLook at the following two pages to see how the freight forward curves are pricing and you'll see that trading any of these tanker companies on the assumption they can CONTINUE to get even remotely close to the levels they were getting is fucking insanity.  Dirty freight (  [https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/energy/freight/tanker-route-td3-middle-eastern-gulf-meg-to-japan-250k-metric-tons-freight-swap-futures\\_quotes\\_settlements\\_futures.html](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/energy/freight/tanker-route-td3-middle-eastern-gulf-meg-to-japan-250k-metric-tons-freight-swap-futures_quotes_settlements_futures.html)  ) and clean freight (  [https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/energy/freight/freight-route-tc14-baltic-futures\\_quotes\\_settlements\\_futures.html](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/energy/freight/freight-route-tc14-baltic-futures_quotes_settlements_futures.html) )   You can see on both of those, the spot/front months are magnitudes higher than June or July freight rates.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI DO believe STNG and DHT are positioned well going in to COVID recovery, but if you are going to go all-in on these things it is important to understand what drove freight rates up (floating storage), why they're falling, how the freight forward curve looks, what price advantage there is for a high-scrubber fleet and how it can be a good or bad thing for a company to have such a high adoption of scrubbers.
