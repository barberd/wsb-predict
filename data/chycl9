Except this was a shitter thought meaning it felt good to get it out of the recess of mind and flush away.\n\nGOOGLE for the win is a fantastically evil stock for you inner troll. It boils down to this...... google profits from exploiting people\u2019s personal information. If you invest in google you are making money off exploitation . Even better then that you are outsourcing your exploitation to other people and you can literally drive your own stock up by randomly clicking on an add every day when your done browsing for no other intention to drive add revenue to google and force companies to stay beholden to google even though you have no interest in purchasing whatever shit there selling as they look at there matrix that more clicks mean more potential buys! It\u2019s fucking awesome. So let your inner troll out buy some google stock and start clicking away on random adds for your own personal gain \ud83d\ude08", "created_utc": 1564115859, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/chycl9/google_for_the_troll_that_lives_inside_you/", "is_self": true}
