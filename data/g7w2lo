You used to make the best croissants in the world before Corona hit the economy. Your restaurants have a burn rate of about $35,000 per week while they sit empty. \n\nMeanwhile, JPow, and Jamie Dimon are having a meeting at the Federal Reserve. Trump phones in. JPow puts him on speaker. Trump is complaining that he can't go bowling or get his face tattooed on his ass. He has planned this tattoo for six months. He needs it now. JPow and Mr. Dimon sigh, and decide to fund a few small businesses so that Trump can go bowling and get a tattoo. \n\nBefore Trump called in, JPow and Mr. Dimon were working on a stimulus plan. They were reviewing Pierre's relief loan application. JPow noted how tasty Pierre's croissants were. Mr. Dimon liked how hot the waitresses are. JPow approved Pierre for a loan of $75 and Mr. Dimon agreed. They were two seconds away from transferring Pierre $75, but the phone call from Trump distracted them. \n\nAfter the call with Trump, JPow and Mr. Dimon quickly fund bowling alleys and tattoo parlours in Georgia. Then they pick up a new application. It is a hedge fund requesting $587 billion. Mr. Dimon gets hard. He sees that this fund YOLO'd a trillion dollars on Croissant Bonds (CBs). CBs were the hottest financial product on the street. Of course that was before Corona. Mr. Dimon likes the investing style of this fund and quickly approves them for the $587 billion. The fund gets the wire transfer right away. THE END. \n\nEPILOGUE: \n\nPierre never receives the loan he applied for. He loses his restaurants and becomes homeless. All of his staff become homeless too. \n\nAfter the hedge fund received their $587 billion they simply bought more CBs. Their initial losses stemmed from CBs, but the hedge fund manager claimed that \"People will always need croissants, so we expect a V shaped recovery\".  \n\nYou can find part I and II in my previous posts.", "created_utc": 1587831144.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7w2lo/going_short_is_now_american_iii/", "is_self": true}
