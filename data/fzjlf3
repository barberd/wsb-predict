We\u2019re gonna let the masses get back to work while billionaires sit it out on their yacht. People will die, but Elon will send one of his goth girlfriends in his cyber truck to Mars and the narrative will shift elsewhere. Hospitals will have a new normal with half their space occupied by COVID and half by elective / non-COVID patients. And it will be a new normal until the vaccine vs herd immunity takes over. I initially thought it would be V shaped recovery, but I think this will affect behavioral habits of average Americans and hurt a select sector of over leveraged businesses. \n\nAnyways, SPY puts 10/16 with a strike of 230", "created_utc": 1586640785.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fzjlf3/choose_your_own_adventure_with_donald_pump/", "is_self": true}
