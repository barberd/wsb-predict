It is clear to me that our current mitigation structure is vastly underwelming. I agree with some leading experts - the second pandemic wave is imminent.\n\nIn every simulation I\u2019ve run/seen, one of the most important factors in spreading the virus is congregation of people in a closed public place for more than a couple minutes (the infection rate goes up dramatically). This is called the \u201cCentral Hub\u201d infection factor.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lnx1okoslpq41.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fa44c06fab5f98e1d99d369d76faf83382cc28c\n\nBelow is the mobility matrix (data from Google) showing the change in people\u2019s behavior over a 6-week period (from Feb 15 to Mar 30th). Some states fared better than others, but because the interstate transportation is wide open, the numbers must improve across the board.\n\n**Mitigation Behavior in US (04/03/2020)** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b7woqp6knpq41.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=13e61206549f775cc950baf327f15c589c1fd5a5\n\nThe current mitigation efforts have produced some positive results (most notably in Transit Stations and Retail/Recreation categories) \u2013 but the drop should be over 90% to be effective. The Grocery/Pharmacy 22% drop is negligible and the Workplaces 38% drop is way too far from the mark. The Residential mobility increase of only 12% is also pitiful. \n\nThe only category that has shown sufficient improvement in mobility is Parks at 19% drop. That number is sufficient due to the outside nature of people congregation (much lower chance of infection).  \n**MBI \u2013 A way to track progress**\n\nI\u2019ve created a simple index called \u201cMitigation Behavior Improvement\u201d (MBI) by assigning an arbitrary score to every category and utilizing the following formula:\n\n**MBI = Sum (Scores) / Number (Scores)**\n\n**MBI (04/03/20) = 10 / 6 = 1.7**\n\nAccording to my calculations, in order to prevent a second wave, the MBI score has to reach 3.75-4.0, which seems far-fetched right now. The only way to get there is an immediate national lockdown with zero personal interstate movement.  \n**The Second Wave**\n\nOnce the restrictions are (even partially) lifted, there\u2019s a high chance of the second infection wave. The second wave will be smaller than the first. Nonetheless, it would create additional frustration and despair. The infection curve will look something like this:\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/4tt22ac9mpq41.png?width=1481&format=png&auto=webp&s=88f05a704c7a166c9e77e9e86f4bbd406ba75f89)\n\nThe government will set up facilities to issue \u201cImmune IDs\u201d on-site to people (with a photo ID) that were previously tested for COVID-19 and recovered. The papers will be issued only to people with specific antibodies (e.g. [https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/bd-to-offer-fingerstick-antibody-blood-test-for-covid-19](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/bd-to-offer-fingerstick-antibody-blood-test-for-covid-19)) in their blood. \n\nPeople with such IDs will be able to travel/work inside and outside freely, as they are no longer infectious. However, by looking at the data I anticipate that only 10-20% will end up being immune by the end of first wave, which is not enough to restart the US economy.\n\nTL;DR\n\nBuy puts on SPY / individual companies at the first signs of initial recovery in Jul/Aug with Nov/Dec expiration, in anticipation of the second wave. The disruption to business/economy will be longer than anticipated (NOT priced in).", "created_utc": 1585967012.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fulo9k/prolonged_us_economic_stagnation_insufficient/", "is_self": true}
