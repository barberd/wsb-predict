{"id": "fnlt76", "title": "Hospitals at Capacity = Home Health Gains", "selftext": "We are at the cusp of an exponential surge in hospitalizations of COVID-19 patients in the United States. Just look to China and Italy of how quick hospitals were besieged. Right now, everything is about \u201cbending the curve\u201d so that our hospitals are not overwhelmed. Today, Governor Cuomo ordered hospitals in New York to increase capacity by 100%, and in L.A. County, ICU beds are already near capacity with non-coronavirus patients. And, despite COVID-19, there will always be a stream of regular patients presenting with run of the mill infections and illnesses that require hospital care. \n\nTypically, these patients have an issue such as a severe infection that needs hospital attention (eg. Diabetic foot ulcers, UTIs, sepsis, ulcers, skin infections) and requires IV antibiotics to successfully be treated. Once the patient is stable, they usually need to continue their IV antibiotic regimen for another 2-4 weeks, so they are then discharged to a skilled nursing facility or sent home, where they can continue to receive care without the high expense of a hospital room.\n\nThese patients are the bread and butter of home infusion pharmacies such as Option Care Health, CVS Coram, and BriovaRx. As hospitals around the country begin to experience a surge in patients, they will soon reach capacity and will be looking to offload more of their patients to skilled nursing facilities and home health agencies to make room for the onslaught of COVID-19 patients. Nursing homes are not particularly desired places to be right now, so home health agencies stand to gain further market share as COVID-19 progresses.\n\nWhile CVS Coram is part of CVS Health (which involves their retail pharmacy operations and insurance PBM operations) and BriovaRx is part of OptumRx and UnitedHealth Group (which are huge insurance players), Option Care Health is the largest stand-alone provider of home infusion services (which recently merged with competitor BioScrip infusion last summer and took over its ticker BIOS at that point).\n\nOPCH stock has taken a beating in this recent market rout, falling about 60% from its highs in February. While such a precipitous drop is certainly warranted for restaurant chains, mall operators, airlines, and cruise lines which have shut down, it seems overdone for OPCH, which as an essential business continues to operate and take on new patients. Last week, OPCH rallied as the broader market finished the week in the red.\n\n**TL;DR: Hospitals will be overloaded and home health companies such as OPCH stand to gain.** \n\nOPCH 10c 4/17\n\nA recent related article:\n\n\u201cA plea from doctors in Italy: To avoid Covid-19 disaster, treat more patients at home\u201d\n\n[https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/21/coronavirus-plea-from-italy-treat-patients-at-home/](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/21/coronavirus-plea-from-italy-treat-patients-at-home/)", "created_utc": 1584977281.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fnlt76/hospitals_at_capacity_home_health_gains/", "is_self": true}
