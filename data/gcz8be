Wall Street is finally realizing that the economy won\u2019t turn on over night after all these botched earnings so I am switching my sentiment to a slow bleed until spx is below 2450. Unfortunately, that means limit down days are the thing of the past for now. \n\nThere has been no good news this weekend so I am hoping for a gap down Monday to provide large premiums on puts. One of the big positions I will start wheeling into is airlines. The Buffett news should cause a sharp sell off but we all know airlines will return to normalcy as people return to work. Hell I am even planning my third vacation with flight prices where they are at. Some of the earnings I am looking at are CHGG, MPC, and PINS. \n\nLet me know what options you\u2019re writing this week. \n\nHere is proof of my non day trades, should\u2019ve held the TWTR puts but I gave a lot back panicking with Friday\u2019s drop. https://i.imgur.com/BUG9zPz.png.
