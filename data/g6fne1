{"id": "g6fne1", "title": "PCG Unusual Options Activity (DD)", "selftext": "Hey all, some of you might remember my [Snapchat DD on Monday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g4wt0t/snapchat_institutional_options_play/). I'm back with another analysis since some posts about PCG had recently caught my eye. This isn't necessarily a trade to play, but to clarify some on the confusion right now. I'm seeing a lot of people say \"buy poots, bearish bet!\" without looking at the level 2 information. So in the interest of saving ya'll tendies, I'm making this post. \n\n**TL,DR:** No positions, but read the whole post, it's better to stay informed and learn a little bit so you don't YOLO your savings into doing the opposite of what institutional investors are doing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Options Activity**\n\nToday was HUGE in terms of PCG options activity. 2 49,501 option blocks were traded at the same time, 49,501 9/18 5p and 49,501 6/19 6p. This sets up a debit spread that represents > 9,000,000 shares , which is almost TWICE of today's total daily volume. This is an astronomical bet by an institution, with a net debit of $3,465,070. \n\nNow the really interesting thing about this trade is that it isn't a straight debit spread. It's actually something called a [\"Diagonal Put Spread,\"](https://www.optionsplaybook.com/option-strategies/put-backspread/#subnav-all-plays-skill) sort of a cross between a long put calendar spread and a short put spread. This is 100% **NOT A BEARISH BET.** Diagonal put spreads are generally a market neutral play, in which you purchase a OTM closer (front month) put and sell a further OTM and longer expiration (back month) put. Once the front month put expires, the institution will usually sell another block of puts at the same expiration and strike as the back month put. This means the institution is playing theta gang until June, by which point it will switch to a short put spread, becoming *bullish.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Fundamentals**\n\nPCG, or Pacific Gas and Electric Company, has been faced with a slew of controversy as of late. Its CEO has just announced that he would be stepping down on June 30th. June 30th also happens to be PCG's reorganization plan deadline before its bankruptcy proceedings. A lot of catalysts happening within a few months and the stock price has been volatile, hovering around the 7-16 range for the past few months. The general consensus is that the stock will fall, but remember, just like in my SNAP play if you follow consensus you will almost always be wrong. When companies file for bankruptcy, the stock price doesn't necessarily go down, rather the price action of PCG will be determined by the circumstances of its restructuring plan, which may actually turn out to be beneficial to shareholders. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What the Institution is Betting on**\n\nThe institution that initiated this trade is betting that the stock will stay neutral until June, by which point once the restructuring details are released will begin to climb again. A possible explanation is that the institution knows exactly what the restructuring details are, and is planning to squeeze out as much profit via theta from dumbass put holders like us, and make out like bandits for the eventual price rise. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why I might be wrong, Conclusion**\n\nThe one major issue I have with forecasting the price of PCG is just the sheer amount of option open interest on all monthly contracts for PCG. There's so much noise that I cannot make a clear determination of what the big boys are playing. However, in my opinion, based on what this particular institution is doing, I do not expect PCG to go lower than $8 anytime soon, and even expect a price rise come June. Don't buy puts, and as always, do your own DD and stay hungry.", "created_utc": 1587613315.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6fne1/pcg_unusual_options_activity_dd/", "is_self": true}
