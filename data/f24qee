Spent 126k on the Truck but here\u2019s the thing..\n\nI walked in and got the Truck for 0 down and 0% interest. The payments worked out to 690 no-weekly on 8 year loan. Only drove the it for 7 months so still have about 115k left.\n\nGet a call from Insurance and their basically covering the MSRP of a cash value 2020 version. Obviously the cash deal makes it cheaper so their fucking me with a 109k cash payout. \n\nI COULD in turn pay off the loan and eat the 6k loss and go buy another one..\n\nOR \n\nI could not pay the loan back and throw down on some major tendie calls.\nI mean it is 0% and their not paying the financier, their paying me lol!!!\n\nOn top of everything now I\u2019ll have a loan without the collateral attached. Seems like a no-brainer but I thought I\u2019d run it through you Autists first.", "created_utc": 1581404296, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f24qee/should_i_throw_down_100k_on_spy_calls/", "is_self": true}
