{"id": "c7xi6n", "title": "New here", "selftext": "Greetings fellow autists. I'm relatively new to investing and need some guidance. I've made some autistic stock decisions in the past so i decided to follow the wise judgements of the investors on this board. Should i just take all of my money, and dump them into YY and MU? Ive been watching both stocks  since yesterday and they've been green every day since, so it has to continue on that path, right? Like if you throw a baseball, it has to go up for a while before coming down. I understand it could come down sooner if they had low volume, but they dont. Ihub says they have high volume so it's like throwing the ball really high. With the given volume , i predict the PPS has to be green for at least 3 more days. Sorry if this sounds stupid, but im just trying not to go full retard. 50-60% retard is okay, but i don't want to lose money. Comments? Concerns? Suggestions?", "created_utc": 1562005490, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c7xi6n/new_here/", "is_self": true}
