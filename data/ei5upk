Therefore, let's talk about the sector as a whole.\n\nBelow are my theories on why the Cannabis market is up today:\n\nEveryone keeps asking why Cannabis is up 10%:\n\n1. Tax loss harvesting season is over so people can re-enter Cannabis\n2. Beverage announcement and further announcements for Cannabis 2.0 will be tomorrow\n3. Short interest is squeezing. As stated before there is a heavy short interest in Canadian Cannabis companies specifically and in the Cannabis sector in general. That is now squeezing as tax loss harvesting season ends and portfolios can re-enter Vannabis and re-balance their risk to include cannabis in 2020\n\n No don't buy dumb calls that expect x2 gains in a week. However, expecting a dead cat bounce coming into early January and playing accordingly may be a good idea.", "created_utc": 1577813162, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ei5upk/were_cgc_bulls_now_why_cannabis_is_up_today/", "is_self": true}
