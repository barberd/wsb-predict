[lmao](https://gyazo.com/eab92e56075f5c85e0ea9bd3d2b739dd)\n\nGetting to the point of my post, **The Trend is Down....**\n\nCompiling data of closing points every two weeks from the start of [2020](https://gyazo.com/101c16d2eb2a5a8e70f764ac34c36c6b), each of the indexes are down-trending for the year & Bitcoin as well. Now the graphs which I've attached here hold little/next to no weight when looking for an indication on what position to take/when, but it's a piece of the puzzle when talking about the outlook for 2020.\n\nAnother piece to the puzzle, since that 'judgement day' post (referencing something I posted 3 weeks ago on r/investing, would link but that got removed along with my post on april 19th warning the clowns in there that they shouldn't be buying into USO/investing in oil lmfao); we have seen 6 green trading days & 9 red trading days on the S&P, signaling to me that investors are favoring selling in the 280-295 range much more so than buying. While the S&P has rallied above 290 on the back of NASDAQ/MAGA movement, it hasn't broken into/through this range with any conviction at all, it's actually forming a head and shoulder top in the trading range - [seen here](https://gyazo.com/f02fd040f5523c644d6fe60306f0721a).\n\nFurther Dissecting the [SPY](https://gyazo.com/0d2716ad2d863bdae7bac638fc901df5) \\- Price action is currently bouncing between the 50 & 200 EMA (EMA is quite significant as it weighs the price around volume traded, while SMA's simply calculate based on closing price day-to-day.) Friday's close placed us right under the 200 EMA (I view it as the ceiling currently.) and would point to downside come open market on monday (tomorrow.) \\*At the time of this post, futures opened with a gap down to 291 and has bounced back up to test this 2940 resistance. Will they push it above for a proper bull break before US markets open? Perhaps, maybe the bulls get their 300 touch; However, I see the indicators hinting to downside more convincing atm.\\*\n\nFurther DD of 'leading indicators' when looking at ST trends (DXY, BTC, XLF) -\n\n[XLF](https://gyazo.com/c4b9708909dc0a43795441d95932229b) \\- (4Hr chart, rather than daily.) The Financial sector has been getting absolutely SLAMMED, like seriously, its almost worse than the beatdowns the small-caps have been receiving. Imo, this questionable performance from the financial sector says A LOT when considering investor uncertainty at the moment. On the four hour, this sector is currently bouncing between the 50 & 200 EMA's as they pinch closer together; which you could say is bullish, however, any and all uptrends on the chart have been broken & it leaves the financials out in no mans land (bearish.) It's currently pressed against it's 'LT' downtrend line (Established in early January after COVID was 'open public info'.) and made a double top rejection off of 23.70.\n\n[BTC](https://gyazo.com/2ddf2dd544a4635c2fa0b3d5de2b3c8a)\\- Touched 10k & crashed over 10% this weekend. As seen in the first screenshot I attached, BTC has been trading almost side by side with the general markets (Most reflective when looking at the S&P or NASDAQ.) I believe this to be a leading indicator of downside ahead similarly to how it was a leading indicator in mid-march when gauging 'how much downside was left in the markets.'\n\n[DXY](https://gyazo.com/fe947858ac8059f62ef92e13efe49c7b) \\- Key when considering short term deflation/inflation of assets. Has broken out above an immense resistance & has been confirming this as new support (people are hoarding cash, much more than they're spending, contrary to popular belief; I wont comment much tho, because tracking the DXY can get complex quick. We're taking it at face value here.) Watch for another major breakout (Would signify people hoarding cash, most likely stocks are getting liquidated at that same time. Comparing the timeline of the last breakout, March 9th- March 20th, this was the same timeline which the S&P took its major leg down from 300-220.)\n\nTLDR - Stonks do go down, they've been maxing out for the last three weeks & deflation is around the corner.
