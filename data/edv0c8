I hope I'm clear.\nWhat would be even better, ideal, for me is to also have graphics and historical information to show the market share growth over time. I'm  hoping this isn't super obvious to find, I've only searched on Google for it so far....\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nAnyhow, could anyone point me in the right direction?", "created_utc": 1576960666, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/edv0c8/looking_to_find_a_source_for_market_share/", "is_self": true}
