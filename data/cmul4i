This may not sound a lot to you but I was shitting bricks.\n\nSo basically yesterday I was thinking - wow this shit is tanking let's buy some weekly SPY calls and some weekly MU calls. Didn't consider IV and was basically panic buying.. thought I was a genius trying to catch a falling knife. To be fair, I've been doing that more often and manage my trades mostly and lucky with picking the bottom.\n\nI was wrong this time. Ended up being down -900$ at the market close yesterday, after-hours at some point -1.6k$.\nWell at that point it was time for some whiskey and get fucked. Stayed up til 5 a.m. (European time). Woke up about 2 hours before market open (2 p.m. European time).\n\nDuring today's trading, I trimmed my position at the open and just closed it -45$ loss.
