Anyways i had sold it for about fi'-fitty so decent $150 profit.  Next day i went to USPS and i did the most half assed thing ever, i took a black garbagebag and wrapped it the PS4 and then put a label on it. When buying the label i was asked, \"do you want insurance for 10% of the value of the contents?\", i was like that's $50, fuck that gay shit. \n\na few days later, i got an email from the purchaser, who complained that the ps4 arrived \\*\\*BROKEN\\*\\*, i was like oh son of a bitch. 15, working at Long John Silvers, what the hell was i suppose to do? i was freaking out. I called USPS and demand that because teh product broke on their watch, i should get a refund, but they said \"no insurance, you fucked boi\". The guy called SONY, and Sony had the PS4 replaced which was a huge relief. Thank you Sony.\n\nFIN", "created_utc": 1568581871, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d4qmby/my_first_experience_doing_a_futures_trade/", "is_self": true}
