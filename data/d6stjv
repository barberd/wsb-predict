{"id": "d6stjv", "title": "Recession Watch 2019 - Reeeeee-pocolopyse", "selftext": "It's the end of September 2019 and you're the typical U.S. consumer. You're feeling confident, raw water in one hand and a greasy iphone in the other. You've just left your job to become an \"entrepreneur\" and signed a 1 week lease at WeWork. Sure, you might not be making money now, but you're confident in you'll be able to pay off your six figure student loans and retire early as soon as a Democrat's in office. Fortunately, while you're downing shots during your lunch-break at the WeWork wet bar, you realize something. You're a complete moron and the world is coming to an end.\n\nThis realization is a sure indicator of peak market conditions. As the marginal consumer of Vanguard mutual funds, and marijuanna stocks, and tech IPOS, the American economy, and thus the world, runs on the ignorance of millions of millennial.  Unfortunately for them, the real it's the geriatrics of the world who hold the real dough and you get bet your fidget spinner that Grandpa isn't the idiot buying the BYND meat IPO. He cucked you a long time ago with social security and he has one more trick up his sleeve, that's right, 10yr treasuries bonds. \n\nWith yields going to as high as -1%, the octogenarians of the world recognize that paying the government money is a better investment of their hard-earned funds than investing in the future. Your grandparents saw you grow up and know how little you're capable of. \n\nTL;DR - The recent debacle in the repo market is a sign that the Fed has gone full-retard. Banks and large corporations, run by senior-citizens, are trying to pull another one on the entitled generation. Much like the housing bubble, the media continues to deny the potential implications of this yuge instability. We have reached peak autism and with consumer confidence at all time highs, keep an eye out for recession.", "created_utc": 1568974607, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d6stjv/recession_watch_2019_reeeeeepocolopyse/", "is_self": true}
