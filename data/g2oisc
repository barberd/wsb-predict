This morning, my options were almost worthless. I have 110 contracts at a cost per share of 4.67. Today at market close they were worth 13.5 CENTS. That's over a 90% loss. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Today at Market Close](https://preview.redd.it/8zjznxul39t41.png?width=1497&format=png&auto=webp&s=886a9f0761647ad05454e1b8106a9832b5f7a353)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, after market close, GILD is up at around 88 dollars, looking to be over 90 by tomorrow at market open. I'll make 11k for every dollar above my break even of approx 85. Right now, I'm just happy I'm not going to loose money - and I'm also happy to be right even more than anything else. All my friends and family thought I was crazy. WHOS FUCKING CRAZY NOW! I'm going to be taking out my original money and only playing with profits from now on....no more YOLO crazy bullshit.", "created_utc": 1587073868.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2oisc/yolo_gain_porn_gild_417_80c_x_110_diamond_hands/", "is_self": true}
