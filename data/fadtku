Monday I got wrecked (ALLY calls, BRKB calls are mainly what fucked me)\n\nI was down $1500 Monday morning, climbed my way up to -$300 by SPY puts.\n\nTuesday was down $1000 at open, climbed up to roughly breakeven. Bought some more SPY puts, ALLY put, BRKB put.\n\nYeseterday was -$1000 at open, climbed up to -$300 by close by buying more SPY puts. Also bought a couple SPCE puts. \n\nThis is the most gain I've had since opening account, and it feels really good to have it happen while so much blood is in the markets.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/4zTelnx](https://imgur.com/a/4zTelnx)", "created_utc": 1582817766, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fadtku/does_this_count_as_gains_porn_im_sorry_im_a/", "is_self": true}
