Even before the virus they must have been hit hard with the protest in HK. They took a huge blow from their earnings last time and should likely be worse this time with everyone staying home in China. \n\nThey are up today, so best time to buy your puts. I know stocks only goes up, but this one really should not. \n\nI'm red on my puts, but got more today.", "created_utc": 1581002209, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eztqqz/wynn_wynn/", "is_self": true}
