{"id": "erdxrg", "title": "I have a dream...", "selftext": " \n\n*I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration of autism in the history of our nation.*\n\n*Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Margin Agreement. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of wage slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their poverty.*\n\n*But one hundred years later, the Autist still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Autist is still sadly crippled by the manacles of Robinhood Gold and the chains of the PDT rule. One hundred years later, the Autist lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Autist is still languishing in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. So we have come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.*\n\n*I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.*\n\n*I have a dream that one day this subreddit will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: \u201cLike 4chan found a Bloomberg Portal.\u201d*\n\n*I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of wage slaves and the sons of former Goldman Sachs brokers will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.*\n\n*I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of retardation, sweltering with the heat of poverty, will be transformed into an oasis of Robinhood options and leveraged ETFs.*\n\n*I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their Robinhood app but by the content of their weekly options.*\n\n*I have a dream today.*\n\n*I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with cum of Goldman Sachs; one day right there in Alabama, little $2k Robinhood gits will be able to join hands with little TD Ameritrade Ameritards.*\n\n*I have a dream today.*\n\n*I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every bull pattern and breakout shall be made low, the shitty stocks will be made plain, and the crooked CEOs will be made straight, and the glory of Shkreli shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.*\n\n*This is our hope. This is the faith that I go back to the* r/stocks *with. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our margin calls into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith we will be able to DD together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to YOLO together, knowing that we will be free one day.*\n\n*This will be the day when all of God\u2019s children will be able to sing with a new meaning, \u201cMy country, \u2018tis of thee, sweet land of tendies of thee I sing. Land where my broker resides, land of the trader's pride, from every mountainside, let freedom ring.\u201d*\n\n*And if WSB is to be a great subreddit this must become true. So let autism ring from the prodigious hilltops of* r/personalfinance*. Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of* r/investing*. Let autism ring from the heightening Alleghenies of* r/optionstrading*!*\n\n*Let autism ring from the snowcapped Rockies of* r/finance*!*\n\n*Let autism ring from the curvaceous slopes of* r/RobinHood*!*\n\n*But not only that; let autism ring from Stone Mountain of* r/pennystocks*!*\n\n*Let autism ring from Lookout Mountain of* finance twitter*!*\n\n*Let autism ring from every hill and molehill of* r/financialindependence*. From every subreddit, let austim ring.*\n\n*And when this happens, when we allow autism to ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every subreddit and every forum, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God\u2019s children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old WSB spiritual, \u201cFree at last! free at last! thank God Almighty, we are free at last!\u201d*", "created_utc": 1579530826, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/erdxrg/i_have_a_dream/", "is_self": true}
