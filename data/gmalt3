{"id": "gmalt3", "title": "The bullish case for Nordstrom DD of a sort.", "selftext": "Greetings Bears, Bulls, and those that are so self deprecating they call themselves autists.\n\nWARNING: I am not about to say in this article that these companies will go up 30% tomorrow, like many here want. Please do not shitpost me because this isn't a sexy stock like TSLA or STNG. I called GM last week and was met with nothing but aggravated people (PM me if you want a link to my post on that, I made 130% return on that today.)\n\nI am bringing to you tidings of a speculative investment opportunity. I have analyzed a few retail stocks that are doing well below their previous highs, most notably Nordstrom and American Eagle.\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/05/coronavirus-nordstrom-is-preparing-to-reopen-its-stores.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/05/coronavirus-nordstrom-is-preparing-to-reopen-its-stores.html)\n\n[https://commercialobserver.com/2020/05/nordstrom-to-shutter-16-stores-lord-taylor-to-liquidate-all-locations/](https://commercialobserver.com/2020/05/nordstrom-to-shutter-16-stores-lord-taylor-to-liquidate-all-locations/)\n\n[https://www.directorstalkinterviews.com/nordstrom-consensus-indicates-potential-48-8-upside/412822065](https://www.directorstalkinterviews.com/nordstrom-consensus-indicates-potential-48-8-upside/412822065)\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/JWN?p=JWN&.tsrc=fin-srch](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/JWN?p=JWN&.tsrc=fin-srch)\n\n[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AEO](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AEO)\n\nHere are a few links surrounding the current events of these retailers, mostly JWN (I think they have the most potential).\n\nAs you will all notice, both of these retailers pass a basic stock screen with flying colors, healthy amounts of cash and little debt. I have been a long term value investor and have been keeping an eye on these two for an opportunity to get in. These companies are well run and were very financially healthy pre-crisis. Well low and behold I crossed that threshold and bought calls today. Both have earnings calls in the coming weeks and I see them as poised to rebound with the rest of the economy as we saw today I estimate that Nordstrom should see a 25-50% return in the coming and AEO about 20-40%.\n\nThis however is where the article ends, I am not going to go over every aspect of each company, as I think that is what aggravated people last time. I will leave this up to you as the reader to look into and see if you found the same value as I did in this sector.\n\nPositions:\n\nAEO 6/19\n\nJWN 6/26\n\nAEO 7/17\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso If I am wrong please come back to this post in the coming weeks and rub it in.", "created_utc": 1589837102.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gmalt3/the_bullish_case_for_nordstrom_dd_of_a_sort/", "is_self": true}
