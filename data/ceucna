At a meeting with a chief 787 engineer in **2008**,  one staffer complained about sending drawings back to a team in Russia  18 times before they understood that the smoke detectors needed to be  connected to the electrical system, said Cynthia Cole, a former Boeing  engineer who headed the engineers\u2019 union from 2006 to 2010.\n\n[https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/building-the-787-dreamliner-a-timeline/](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/building-the-787-dreamliner-a-timeline/)\n\n**2008**\n\nApril:  Boeing confirms yet another six-month delay due to continuing problems  with unfinished work from suppliers.
