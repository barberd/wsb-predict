It was horrible, depressing , and I nearly gave up. I made one if the worst possible plays ever and it cost me alot. \n\nHere are steps for anyone who may be down a significant amount if you want to get back \n\n1. Take a break. Definately take a bit off. Mindset has to be PERFECT for this. You have to be careful and make sure you are absolutely focused on what you are doing. \n\n2. Play safer. Try out shares, use longer term options, try in the money calls. Do a diversified set up and see how it can work. Try different sectors you maybe not be familiar with as well\n\n3. Dont trade for the first 30 minutes. Theres too much craziness happening. Impossible to tell what may happen,  wait until 10 am to plan. I'm bullishly biased so I like shares and calls so I wait for dips \n\n4. HIGH QUALITY COMPANIES ONLY. This one may be the most important lesson. The reason for my 25k loss was because I'd did not follow this rule. Stick to companies with incredible balance sheets and strength. And liquidy is a huge factor \n\n5. Accept it will take time. This was the hardest part, but you have to accept it will take a while. You need to treat it as a grind and how you can get closer everyday to motivate", "created_utc": 1591975297.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h7mneu/if_anyone_is_down_alot_please_read/", "is_self": true}
