I think it\u2019d be better to focus on one, maybe two positions and have strategies attached... This put spread is the practice of a strategy that I believe based off the following DD:\n\nOle rona ain\u2019t done with us just yet.... but that doesn\u2019t mean a good sized second wave, or closing of businesses in the near future, means the entire market plunge. It does, however, have an affect on the way people go about their business, especially their travel.\n\nTues ATH new daily corona cases in TX\n\nhttps://www.star-telegram.com/news/politics-government/article243567327.html\n\nI am indeed, born and raised FL man, and with that I know we are all quite familiar with the fact FL GOV RON DESANTIS, is not taking the steps necessary to minimize a second wave. Let me remind you FL is now the 3rd most populous state above NY.\n\nI live near St Pete, I see the effects and business closes left and right.\n\nhttps://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2020/06/13/as-florida-coronavirus-cases-spike-downtown-st-petersburg-sees-impact/\n\nAnd I know everyone on reddit saw this:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ZZamrmTMs6w\n\nWe\u2019ve also seen hesitancy in Asian markets about a second wave. What I\u2019m getting at is, more COVID is coming, just don\u2019t know how much. Testing is expanding greatly, protests have led to no social distancing, etc. etc.\n\nAs news surfaces in the coming weeks about the growing cases, which we know is coming, I think we should expect people to be less willing to travel via airline. Likely cancelling trips for 4th of July... i mean let\u2019s be honest, not many people travel for the 4th anyway. and if you were thinking about it flying for the 4th, hearing about COVID cases going up would likely make you rethink.\n\nNo, i don\u2019t think more COVID cases, unless extreme, would cause another big sell off, but I believe the short term impact on people\u2019s travel in the near future would be negative due to the news we all know is coming.\n\n\n[last weeks (my first week) // positions and balance ](https://imgur.com/gallery/pSimDrW)\n\nEDIT:\n\nfrom comment below:\n\n\u201cI'm in WPB, FL and it's business as usual. Fucks wearing no masks, like nothing ever happened. My local strip clubs have signs saying they'll be open on Friday.\u201d\n\nthis is 110% true, went to car dealer for service today and NOT ONE sales, service, or any staff with masks\n\nTDLR;  COVID coming back but who knows how much. Unless drastic, most should be okay. Some, especially airlines are gonna hurt, especially with recent and upcoming news and holiday.", "created_utc": 1592872997.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/he4jyu/boutta_hit_a_lick_with_my_last_90_in_rh_spending/", "is_self": true}
