I started with $950 in January 2018 trading stocks and worked my way up to $2200 over 2 years. Then during the SPCE meme someone said \u201cscared money don\u2019t make money.\u201d That shit made my balls drop and I made $700 in 1 hour while I was at the gym. I felt powerful. My risk tolerance became unlimited. Over the month of February I worked my way up from $2900 to $56,000. Then, March happened. Specifically I found out the Greeks could fuck me harder than a fraternity can fuck a freshmen named Haley. Now I sit with an account balance of $573, bag holding spy puts. But you know what? YOU KNOW WHAT! THE MEMES ARE WORTH IT. As I sit here completely drunk at noon laughing my ass off I realize it was worth it. \nTL;DR \ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32\ud83c\udffcs was a myth", "created_utc": 1586115860.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fvjxmp/the_laughs_are_worth_55k/", "is_self": true}
