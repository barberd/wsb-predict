A month ago I had a maxed out TFSA (Canadian 401k), money in my RRSP (Canadian ROTH), and un unleveraged cash account. I've been working since I was 14, and have been supporting myself since I was 16, and this has taken a lot of work to max my investments and close to neutral net worth (I am in third year of university).\n\nI had been swing trading equities for a while, ya know r/investing type shit. 0.05% gain in a day. Was satisfied. \n\n Then, I discovered WSB. Learned how to leverage to my personal risk tolerance (leveraged my full TSFA in my margin account), and bet on FDs. I was making 500$ in a day, keeping my profits small, and not getting greedy.\n\nI set myself a goal: If I can make 5000$ before summer, I can take it off and pursue a startup venture I have been working on in the background. \n\nEarly Feb, trying to approach this smartly, I figured lets forget the stoploss so I dont realize my losses. Stonks only go up. Also, lets leverage MAXIMUMLY so I can get out of the market sooner than later. Then I went all in on MSFT 200 3/20 since nutella and bill fuks. \n\nThen it drilled. And drilled. And I kept betting it would go back up. It didn't.\n\nLast week, I had 1000$ left. Puts, since stonks only go down and beer virus is the end of the world.\n\nToday, all my accounts are unofficially blown up. \n\nI have less than 1k left to my name. Time to long $ROPE. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://imgur.com/anjaLFQ \n\n https://imgur.com/2p26qgp \n\n https://imgur.com/47b9IEd", "created_utc": 1583170515, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fcfmz9/student_loan_loss_porn_14k_usd/", "is_self": true}
