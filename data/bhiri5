{"id": "bhiri5", "title": "A Savior for WSB Autists - Vertical Spreads", "selftext": "*This is a simple overview, the details of how the options actually function isn't explained.*\n\nHey all, just thought i'd make a post briefly explaining a type of options strategy other than straight calls and puts. This strategy can allow you to COMPLETELY get rid of time decay at the cost of slightly lower reward. It's a much better risk/reward ratio however and way higher chance of profit. I understand us fellow autists thoroughly enjoy FDs and YOLO bets but why not make some money with this strategy first so you have even more $$$ to lose on dumb bets? Sounds good enough for me. First I'll show two potential outcomes with different strategies then explain a little further.\n\nI'll briefly go over vertical spreads and if you want more info there's plenty of info on the internet (i'm sure youtube is fine too).\n\nLet's take $AMD for example. We will assume its price at the time of this post of $25.09.\n\nLet's say you chose a $29.00 call expiring on 12/21/18. The contracts are $1.50 a pop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/0y7sltiqpju21.png\n\nThis is a general overview of your potential outcomes. While [OptionsProfitCalculator.com](https://optionsprofitcalculator.com/) isn't COMPLETELY accurate it can give you a good idea of what to expect.\n\nNow let's look at if you chose to do a vertical spread for $AMD that expires on 12/21/18 but now buying a call ITM @ $22.00 and *WRITING* a call OTM @ $29.00. The $22.00 contract you are buying is $4.72 each, and the $29.00 contract you are writing is again, $1.5 each.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/jq59aarspju21.png\n\nAs you can see, time decay is completely eliminated. The outcomes are MUCH more in your favor. As long as AMD moves up a little bit and stays there you're in the clear even at expiration. The same applies with Vertical Put Spreads. You can adjust your strike price for the options you write/buy to tailor perfectly to your own risk tolerance.\n\nI understand this post isn't SUPER detailed but if you have any questions, places like investopedia and youtube can PROBABLY answer them better than I can.\n\nVertical spreads, in my opinion, are clearly a better choice by far. While it doesn't fit the FD/YOLO culture of WSB, maybe some of you who have lost thousands and want a safer way to play options would like this strategy. It's super simple and significantly increases your chance of profit.\n\nLastly, the biggest difference with this type of trade is that your max profit and loss is already defined.\n\nThis video will probably help clear any questions up: [Vertical Spreads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_0SbRaHv1U&amp;app=desktop)", "created_utc": 1556257100, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bhiri5/a_savior_for_wsb_autists_vertical_spreads/", "is_self": true}
