{"id": "faicg0", "title": "SIX - all-time low already with massive headwinds", "selftext": "tl;dr SIX 22.5p 4/17 will print tendies, as MCAS has kicked in\n\nAt the time of this writing, SIX is somehow miraculously up 0.85% to $26.00 on the day, having peaked at an even more ridiculous $27.34. All this means is that puts can be had on the cheap. Why should you be jumping on this gravy train?\n\n* The company reported Q4 2019 earnings last week, and they were horrible. So bad that they were forced to slash their dividend by 75%.\n* The company slashed the dividend despite doing everything it could to avoid it - like cutting back on marketing and services costs. This has backfired as it's made the in-park experience worse.\n* SIX entered a massive deal with a Chinese partner to open parks in China, but the partner failed to fulfill its obligations and SIX has since sent default notices to them. $10 million dollar loss right there that isn't getting recovered.\n* Coronavirus will hit every segment of the hospitality industry, including theme parks. The first community-spread case of beer flu in the US happened in Sonora County, CA - where SIX happens to have one of its largest parks.\n* SIX has a new CEO named Mike Spanos, who was previously CEO of PepsiCo in Asia, North Africa, and the Middle East. He will have his work cut out for him, especially since the CFO just announced that he is retiring this year in the midst of the entire clusterfuck.\n\nIt's not unthinkable to imagine this company going bankrupt, but even if it stays afloat, a drop is incoming. I expect it to go as low as $20 by April, especially if the prevailing market trend continues downward. I'm in on the position at the top, and you should get in too if you want the tendies. Unlike cruise and airline stocks, puts on this one are still available on the cheap.", "created_utc": 1582835311, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/faicg0/six_alltime_low_already_with_massive_headwinds/", "is_self": true}
