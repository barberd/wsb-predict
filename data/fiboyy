Please forgive me for not taking my profits, I was new. I heard you in my head telling me to sell, but I didn\u2019t listen. For that, I am sorry. You gave me another chance when I asked for it and deep in my mind I heard you, but didn\u2019t take. \n\nGod forgive me for I have sinned twice. Thou shall always obey the words you place in my heard. Here I come to you on this Friday night, weak, tired, and begging for one more chance. \n\nGod please make my $INO 3/20 5c go back up to the ath, god please make my $SPY 3/27 200p come to fruition, god please make my $NCLH 3/20 10p mature to their greatest potential. Here I am god on my knees. I hereby sacrifice my $ALLY 3/20 32c. \n\nGod you have shown me on this Friday night how powerful you are. Seeing my funds evaporate before my eyes while the DOW went in the opposite direction.\n\nGod I pray to you tonight. Please answer my request above and I shall obey for as long as I am on this planet and deep into the afterlife. Please get out of my head for now. \n\nBow my head in silence and whisper Hail Mary\n\n[My Prayer](https://imgur.com/8h1aO7x)", "created_utc": 1584153681.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fiboyy/my_prayer_to_the_wall_street_bet_gods_please/", "is_self": true}
