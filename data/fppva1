My aunt lives in rural Alabama and was feeling sick for almost a week until my cousin forced her to go see a doctor.  Symptoms were as you would expect.  Feeling tired, running fever, and shortness of breath.  She has a lot of comorbidities like diabetes (because bama) so that doesn't help.\n\nShe was admitted to the hospital in a large city and over the course of the past week they have had to put her on a ventilator and drained fluid off of her lungs multiple times.  Finally today (one week later), they move her to an isolated part of the hospital and have tested her for corona virus.  Test result still pending.  She should live although we don't know for sure yet but just wanted to put it out there that this thing is just getting started and it's starting to hit rural parts of the country.  The worst part is hospitals in these areas aren't even taking it seriously.  The worst is yet to come.\n\nTL;DR: SPY $260c 4/17 $272.5c 5/1 $200p 4/24 VXX $44p 4/3", "created_utc": 1585279942.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fppva1/dd_from_rural_america_and_the_state_of_hospitals/", "is_self": true}
