{"id": "ghsed7", "title": "NVDA ER play", "selftext": "$NVDA earnings report comes out 5/21. In anticipation the stock is climbing to ATH, I think we have some more room to run before the report. I think the ER will be very similar to AMD's. They will beat earning and either keep or lower their guidance. Play is to get in now and and dump before they report so either 5/15 or 5/22 calls but don't get caught holding the bag. After earnings if it follows AMD like I think it will go down to \\~$300. Once it does that scoop up some calls a month from that date and boom! Tendies", "created_utc": 1589219083.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghsed7/nvda_er_play/", "is_self": true}
