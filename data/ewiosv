If it tanks on the HK Exchange during their trade hours (our nighttime), how likely is it that it will tank in the NYSE when it opens in the morning? I guess technically you could do the same with any major companies listed on any foreign exchange, but I havent really looked into it. Just a thought I had. Might work. Might not. I'll go back to staring at futures now.", "created_utc": 1580444303, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ewiosv/profiting_from_time_difference/", "is_self": true}
