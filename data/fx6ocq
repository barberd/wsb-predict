With that being said, things have gotten naughty.\n\nBefore/if you read this little story just know I\u2019m not going to post all of the positions because 1. I don\u2019t know where to find the history in a way that\u2019s easy to screenshot and post. 2. I used two separate brokers, check my post history. 3. I don\u2019t give enough fucks to put in that much effort (I actually do, please accept me.)\n\nI put in 25k into my ToS account like a month back to try and take day trading seriously. I thought to myself, I\u2019ll just do credit spreads and make an easy 2k a month. The inner gambler in my mind had a naked lube filled wrestling match with the sensible person in my mind and ended up winning. I lost that 25k in about a week.\n\nSince I was flagged as PDT and didn\u2019t want to put in another 25k, I put 6k into Schwab and bought MRNA at the top because the money hasn\u2019t cleared for calls yet, turned that to 3k. \n\nI took that 3k, and bought some mothafucking SPY calls near the bottom, turned that shit to ~27k.\n\nQuickly flipped that 27 into 3k, and then made some naughty trades. One of them was MSFT calls at 140. They were 155c and I made about ~7k off of them. The bulk of the profits came from two nights ago (37k total) from /ES futures calls. Stayed up all night and was one of the craziest experiences ever. As of this morning, I\u2019m sitting on 62k and happy as can be.\n\n37k profit 6 hours:\n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/2ltMFwr\n\nI was doing Community Voted Yolos before I got banned and will continue that on Sunday of this week. Post your best/funniest DD to the comments on that post and if I pick your play (5k weekly Yolo) I\u2019ll give you 10 percent of the profits. \n\nCheers and happy to be back!\n\nFuck Derek.\n\nEdit: mods, can I get some flair?", "created_utc": 1586353325.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fx6ocq/what_a_ride_25k6k3k27k3k59k/", "is_self": true}
