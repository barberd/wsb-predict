{"id": "hc7d1n", "title": "short california real estate", "selftext": "TLDR $35 CBREp 08/21 or farther\n\nEveryone is working from home these days, most of all software engineers. San Francisco is full of tech companies and many will be working from home possibly into next year. I myself am a software engineer and can tell you that I will be working from home the rest of the year. Being able to work from home means you can live wherever you want. Californians will use this opportunity to move out of the city and even out of the state, most notably to Texas. A 2 million dollar house in california could go for 300K in Texas, californians who can work from home indefinitely would be insane not to take advantage of this. As a result property values in california will plummet.\n\nCBRE reached $55 June 8th and since then has dropped nearly $10 and I think it has a long way to go down. It reached around $30 at it's lowest March 23, if a second wave hits combined with people already moving california because of property values being too high even before coronavirus and combined with more people moving to take advantage of work from home we have a ticking time bomb. Earnings are expected 07/30, load up on puts 08/21 or farther.", "created_utc": 1592595855.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hc7d1n/short_california_real_estate/", "is_self": true}
