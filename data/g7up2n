Doug has been down and out for a very long time until recently. Doug got a job at a Tex Mex restaurant and received 5 thousand dollars in backed child support checks. Doug almost instantly loses 2 grand trying to trade crypto. Time passes and Doug gets a raise at his shitty Tex Mex restaurant job. Doug hears about his friends trading options. Doug literally takes the last of his money, behind on bills and at risk of eviction and decides to dump it all into SNAP 15p 5/8. Doug gets his portfolio whiped out in 2 days flat and then proceeds to go on a rampage blaming everyone but himself for his decisions. Doug's life is ruined and now Doug's on the run. PLEASE DON'T BE LIKE DOUG!\n\nEDIT: In case anyone was wondering this is 100 percent a true story and that is a real picture of Doug. He does work at Olers bar and grill in Findlay Ohio.", "created_utc": 1587826156.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7up2n/a_cautionary_wsb_public_service_announcement/", "is_self": true}
