Check out the call option chain for Jun 26 \u201920 and Jul 02 \u201920 \u2013 there is decent VLM and OI all throughout the 50s.\n\n**My Impression : The only news I can see for today was that Nexity chooses Oracle and Accenture to support its finance function transformation, which came out at 12:38 PM. The largest call trade today was at 3:56 PM for 970 JUL 2 20 56C. Overall, the call the volume looks bullish, and the company should do well during CoVID-19. I will likely open a call spread or bull put on this tomorrow morning if I can get a reasonable price.**\n\n2.  ***Ticker: HOG***\n\n**Spot Price** **:24.72 +.17, (+.69%)**\n\n**Sector: Consumer Cyclical**  **Industry : Recreational Vehicles**\n\n**Company Summary** (from Yahoo Finance)**:** Harley-Davidson, Inc. manufactures and sells custom, cruiser, and touring motorcycles.
