Donated 50$ to Autism Speaks, and will be donating more to other charities later today. Will update this post with proof of those donations. I think once congress passes some stimulus today or tomorrow we will get a bounce up and then I'll probably rebuy some puts with a later expiry. I may or may not sell the rest of my puts at EOD today. Considering just letting the 8 I have left ride though. Overall gains over 100% on this trade. BTW, I started with less than 10k not too long ago. Anything is possible with this volatility.\n\nUpdate to post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fh8kal/im\\_going\\_to\\_be\\_rich\\_from\\_my\\_yolo/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fh8kal/im_going_to_be_rich_from_my_yolo/)  \n\n\n  \n\n\n[Thanks to JDintheD for the suggestion.](https://preview.redd.it/cg3zu0l6t9m41.png?width=1155&format=png&auto=webp&s=66616f91d4f289df806e8af207ee6108d3a60bb0)\n\n[Proof](https://preview.redd.it/g7p6kx3zr9m41.png?width=1343&format=png&auto=webp&s=e704584d2d9e769f357a9ade8cee8c62085f3d01)", "created_utc": 1584030819.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhj46r/mr_shaky_hands_makes_2x_gains_update_on_my_yolo/", "is_self": true}
