Expectations are too high and they're going to miss because there are supply chain disruptions that I would imagine most people don't know about.  \n\n\nPOSITION: 30k on PTON 30p 8 May 20  \n\n\nSo, I wanted to see what all the hype was about for this butt fucking $2k stationary bike with a cult following. If you try to order on their website right now, you'll see this message:  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tgvjxmlqh7w41.png?width=814&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e7597210e35b23131f63e303884867ffbc945fb\n\n  \nFirst thought people have for this message is strong demand, which is why the stock has absolutely mooned since its bottom on Puts Immolation day (3/14 )  \n\n\nBUT, I wanted to do some digging. into this.

NOT DEMAND.  \n\n\nEveryone who's holding PTON stock is gonna get rekt.  \n\n\nEveryone who's YOLOing on PTON calls will go live with their wife's boyfriend.  \n\n\nSo, buy puts. Stock will plummet when they report on this supply chain disruption in their earnings call. Any subscription numbers they report are also trash since they offered free trials which generate $0 in revenue.
