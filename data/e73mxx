{"id": "e73mxx", "title": "Fin on GPRO calls", "selftext": "Rumor from the GPRO CEO is that GPRO had a great holiday and their new cameras are selling faster than any other camera they have produced. Last earnings call, they barely beat expectations but remained unprofitable. GPRO has a healthy average volume at 5 million. They are the household name for outdoor action self-recording, but it's a rather niche market in comparison, which limits their market share. Even though they have a 52-week high of $7.64, the market will probably value GPRO at around $5 a share in current conditions, because it's between what people want it to be worth and what people think it's worth. \n\nI think it's not a huge play, but it's a fairly safe play. GPRO is expected to have their next earnings call on 06 Feb after hours. I think the stock is stable at ~$4 a share, though their negative EPS will be a red flag to many investors, this is a good option play. GPRO has a high likelyhood of rallying around the holiday sales, and will probably beat their expected EPS for Q4 2019, which also has a high likelyhood of increasing the value of GPRO stock because people will see it as a possible turn around point.\n\nWill it be? Fuck if I know, but I'm betting that GPRO will likely be around $4.50 - $5 by their next earning call because people will want to buy into a cheap stock with huge upside potential. You can play the earnings and buy a Feb 21st call, which has a greater chance of being worth more than playing it safe just riding the momentum up to the earnings with Jan 24 calls.", "created_utc": 1575662211, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e73mxx/fin_on_gpro_calls/", "is_self": true}
