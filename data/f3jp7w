Do you even bother to look at the chart before hand to make an educated trade?\n\nIt\u2019s honestly so hard to feel bad for you clowns buying at the top and bitching after it either stalls out or reverses. Stocks always attempt to return to normalcy sooner or later. Fuckers on here never learn. So shut the fuck up, quit your bitching, and maybe read a book or two and learn about even just simple TA instead of gambling like a fucking moron and complaining on here when you inevitably lose your money.\n\nEdit: if you don\u2019t like this post or TA, it\u2019s likely because you\u2019re a butthurt idiot that can\u2019t put the time in to learn it in the first place.
