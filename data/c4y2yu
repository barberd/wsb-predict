The GDP is the accumulation of all dollars that have exchanged hands. This includes purchases made through credit, debt and the interest therein. \n\u2022\tCorporate Credit as a percentage of GDP is at an ATH\n\u2022\tRecord low unemployment is ALWAYS met with a recession soon after\n\u2022\tRecord Government Debt\n\u2022\tRecord Corporate Debt\n\u2022\tRecord Personal Debt\n\u2022\tRecord Auto Loan Defaults - both percentage of loans and number amount\n\u2022\tThe Fed was not able to balance their budget sheet. They will be forced to go back to QE and add on to their $3.8T.\n\nRecession is coming and the Fed can\u2019t do shit about it this time:\n\u2022\t2008 worked because the fed convinced investors that they would normalize their balance sheet. When they end QT in September, they will prove that they can NOT balance their budget sheet.\n\u2022\tThe fed will decrease rates, eventually all the way to zero, but it will have no effect. Going from 2.5% to 0% will not make a big enough difference.\n\nInflation:\n\u2022\tThe fed decreasing rates directly increases inflation\n\u2022\tDue to recession, the fed will eventually go back to QE \u2013 this will increase inflation\n\u2022\tDue to recession, the US debt will explode even further\n\u2022\tDue to recession, the fed will do whatever it can for the US to not default on its debt. Including devaluing the dollar \u2013 this will increase inflation\n\u2022\tDue to recession, the stock market will crash. This will cause main street to make a run on their IRAs, their 401ks and their pensions \u2013 this will increase inflation (This will also be fucking chaos).\n\u2022\tThe fed devaluing the dollar will create a rush in foreign markets to get out of the dollar \u2013 this will increase inflation\n\u2022\tRussia is 100% out of the dollar \u2013 this will increase inflation\n\u2022\tChina has begun to pour their dollar reserves back into the US \u2013 this will increase inflation\n\nThe best hedge against inflation \u2013 Gold.\n\nJNUG\nNUGT\nGLD\nGDXJ\nNEM\nAEM\nKL\nAUY\nGOLD\nRGLD", "created_utc": 1561418809, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c4y2yu/the_ultimate_trade_for_2019/", "is_self": true}
