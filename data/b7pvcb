{"id": "b7pvcb", "title": "Tech Earning this Month...", "selftext": "Let's talk tech trades. You like tech, you see that all of the tech companies are reporting the 4th and 5th week of April...   \n\n\nI'm looking at QQQ and of course TQQQ. IV seems pretty low right now on 4/26 and 5/10 expirations. I'm looking at the 5/10s simply so I have exposure and time if 4/26 doesn't go my way. Anyone else looking at this as well or are you learning towards individual exposure? Why?  \n\n\nSome interesting stuff:  \n1) 04/26 26.69% of the weighted index for QQQ will be reporting (AMZN, FB, MSFT, INTC)   \n2) 05/10 15.24% will be reporting (AAPL and GOOGL)  \n3) You'd have 41.93% of QQQ index exposure by buying the 5/10s for pretty much all the big boy tech earnings.   \n", "created_utc": 1554051552, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b7pvcb/tech_earning_this_month/", "is_self": true}
