Diamond Hands", "selftext": "**Turtle Beach Corp ($HEAR):**\n\nI\u2019m going to start with the reason why Turtle Beach first came onto my radar. After reading *Everybody Lies* by Seth Stephens-Davidowtiz which focuses on the field of data science, I became intrigued of how I could use it in my investing strategies. Now, of course I know data is important in investing, massive companies will use satellite images looking on Tesla factory parking lots to count the inventory levels, but the difference now was that I had access to real time unbiased data using google trends, and some other open source tools. During the start of lock-down I started to observe trends happening in the real world and used my online resource to see if I could confirm my hypothesis.\n\nI noticed inside my own friend group and online that there was a sudden interest in gaming due to an increased amount of people being quarantined at home. Now, I knew gaming companies were an obvious beneficiary during the pandemic but what game was everyone playing? Call of Duty Warzone was released on March 10th, 2020 which was almost perfect timing having over 30 million players in under 2 weeks. Call of Duty Warzone was created by Activision Blizzard ($ATVI) but it was a free game, and ATVI was already a $40 billion company so how much could that actually impact the share price in the long-term. Now in a first person battle royale game such as Warzone, directional sound is very important to having success in the game. So obviously we can target gaming headset companies. What are the most popular headsets? Astro, Logitech, Turtle Beach are just a couple of the brands of headsets out there but realistically the best way to get direct exposure to such a niche market is through Turtle Beach. Now this was all a hypothesis, let's look at what the data shows. (PS: this is the trend from today, although I originally purchased on March 30th when I was doing these activities)\n\n[Figure 1: Google Trends Relative Search Volume (5 years); xbox headset (blue), gaming headset (red), turtle beach headset (red)](https://imgur.com/a/sWzsUIb)\n\nWe can obviously see this data is quite cyclical with a double peak which occurs the last week of November and the third/fourth week of December every calendar year for obvious reasons. Now we can obviously see there has been a substantial demand in late March and throughout all of April in 2020, peaking higher than the holiday quarter for the first time as far back as the data is available (2004). Can we compare this increased demand to anything else we have seen? If you look closely you can see the slight uptick in demand in Jan/Feb 2018, that was when fortnite went mainstream and peaked in the gaming world. Fortnite is a battle royale game, similar to Warzone in its play-style. How did Turtle Beach ($HEAR) perform during that time?\n\n[Figure 2: Turtle Beach Share Price Q1 and Q2 2018](https://imgur.com/JqxYEwI)\n\nAfter a surprise revenue and eps beat in Q1 of 2018 the share price of Turtle Beach went to a share price of over $30 from a recent low of under $2. Now it is important to notice that the company struggled to maintain this value for the shareholders over time, but the balance sheet was in a much worse position at that time.\n\nSince 2018 the Turtle Beach management team has significantly improved their balance sheet including reducing the debt/equity ratio. They have created strategic partnerships and acquisitions allowing them to gain market share in fast growing areas. As well, they have been able to diversify into PC Gaming instead of purely console.\n\nThe current global demand is great for Turtle Beach in the short to medium-term, as well, the new Xbox and Playstation is scheduled to be released in Q4 of 2020. With my confidence increasing in the management team I believe this company has a ton of upside potential in the next 3-6 months, possibly longer. This is not a play you can just invest in and leave for 20 years though, you must monitor the environment for the gaming industry, pay close attention to the status of the brand among the community, and keep a close eye on the execution of the management team.\n\n[GAINZ](https://imgur.com/F3yjnWo)\n\nEither way, Turtle Beach has earnings after hours today. My positions are already up significantly but I\u2019m holding with diamond hands.
