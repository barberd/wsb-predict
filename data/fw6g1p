Learn \"The Greeks\"**\n\nRemember, this isn't the simple world of stocks. You're trading complex financial derivatives. Welcome to the big leagues. It's actually quite simple to understand why most of you are losing:\n\n*complex derivatives* \\+ *autists* = *catastrophic results*\n\nBefore you trade options, you need to have a good understanding of Greeks - **Delta**, **Gamma**, **Theta** and **Vega** \u2013\u00a0and how each will affect the value of your option over time. Here is a simple infographic that /u/CooldudeXD provided so that people like us can understand:\n\n[https://i.redd.it/yi9jnkqh0wp11.png](https://i.redd.it/yi9jnkqh0wp11.png)\n\n\\------\n\n**2. Less YOLO, More DCA (Dollar cost average)**\n\nMany of you seem to be throwing your entire net worth into positions at once because you're so confident that the trade will move in your favor. I know this because I constantly see \"$0 buying power\" in your RH portfolio screenshots.\n\nI understand that YOLO'ing can be fun and exciting in the moment, but you are setting yourself up for imminent failure. I cringe when I see what some of you are doing. It's almost like you guys are purposely trying to lose so that you can come on here to post your loss porn. Some of you are truly sick in the head.\n\nRemember that with the way options are designed, there are many forces working against you (theta decay, implied volatility crush, etc). This means that the stock can move in your direction, but your option will still lose value. It's more likely than not that after your first purchase, your option will lose some value in the subsequent days/weeks. That's why it's imperative that you always have sufficient capital in your account to keep adding to your position at lower prices. This will lower your average cost and make it more likely that you'll come out profitable.\n\nThis is probably the #1 reason many of you fail. You need to build the temperament to be able to scale into your positions appropriately over time rather than use up all of your dry powder on day 1.\n\n\\------\n\n**3. Patience**\n\nI get sad whenever I see some of you buying options that expire in a week. Your thesis may be correct, but you need to give your positions time to fully play out. No one can predict what's going to happen in the next few days or week. This means you should probably buy options with later expiration dates so that you aren't forced out of your position too early.\n\nYou also need the patience to stick to your beliefs (\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c). Too many of you are flip-flopping positions because you can't handle a bit of temporary pain. If your option loses 50% of its value, this should excite you because you can now buy more at a much cheaper price. If it loses another 50% after that, this should excite you further because you can now buy even more and you know that your eventual gains will be substantial. Learn to play the long game and stop focusing so much on the short term.\n\n\\------\n\nI know I sound like your wife right now and this isn't the post you wanted to read. In fact, a lot of my advice goes against what wsb is all about. But this is the post you need if you want to become a profitable autist. \n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1586205232.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fw6g1p/simple_tips_to_profitability_how_to_make_tendies/", "is_self": true}
