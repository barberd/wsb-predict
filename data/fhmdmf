This is all happening because the market is pricing in potential worst case scenarios, as I have been hearing for days from CNBC and Bloomberg TV.  Once some good news comes through, specifically the start of mass testing in the United States and a subsequent decline of new cases. \n\nAlso, don't forget Russia and the Saudis are squabbling over oil prices.  The Fed basically just showed that it will inject however much money is necessary to prop this economy up.  Once Congress gets their head out of each other's ass and push something bipartisan through to counter the biological issue we could see a pop... IMO thats what the market is waiting on. \n\nI'm not saying sell your Puts, and I'm not saying blow your wad on Calls..  I'm slowly buying in and averaging down LEAPS with AMD.  Currently, they are the only company I believe will have explosive growth once this subsides. They even said they expect to continue the growth they've experienced over the last few years.  \n\n[AMD 2016 - Present](https://imgur.com/gallery/EY4DiLD)\n\nAMD just had a [Financial Analyst Day](https://ir.amd.com/events/event-details/financial-analyst-day-2020) just click the link, register for free, and check out all the strong fundamentals.  I did buy some Calls for AMD for 3/20 $53 only couple hundred bucks in case we get good news from Congress coupled with product launches... Just dropped new GPU overseas and there appears to be major laptops getting ready to be released next week containing AMD chips. \n\n[News](https://imgur.com/a/9H7JWnz)\n\nI am also stepping into GE for long term...  They're at a  new 52 week low. \n\n[Positions](https://imgur.com/a/mqfaGGM)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSlowly averaging down keeping buying power available. Only buying 1 or 2 a day to average down.", "created_utc": 1584042731.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhmdmf/my_current_positionsleaps_on_amd_ge_shanghai/", "is_self": true}
