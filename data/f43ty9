Can someone tell me EXACTLY what I need to read and learn about because I don't want to waste time learning in an inefficient way. Options just seem so juicy( but i dont know shit about them).

Please help me. The thought of not maximizing this opportunity is eating away at my pysche.\n\nalso the reason I'm asking you guys is because I'm a pretty clueless, talentless individual.
