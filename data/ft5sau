They think this is a freaking vacation, pop some movies on and let this whole thing blow over in 2 weeks. The reality is people are getting thier last paycheck and are broke for 6+ months as this thing blows over. People don't have savings, their credit cards will be maxxed and bank accounts over drafted. They won't even have to cancel their NFLX account becuase the bank will decline the payment transaction for them. Netflix is not immume to the virus and sitting at all time highs makes it a attractive short.\n\nThere are alternative to netflix, just like people will loot and shoplift from retail stores during recessions, they will loot and steal movies via the pirate bay. Time to cancel NFLX and start watching free youtube videos", "created_utc": 1585766064.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ft5sau/short_netflix_long_the_pirate_bay/", "is_self": true}
