{"id": "bwxg9t", "title": "Do I get to keep this profit?", "selftext": "So I've short sell CVNA after hours today at $62.20 and a moment later i set my \"buy to cover\" at $61, potential gain of $1.2 a share. The trade immediately went through and got a confirmation and everything. I then turned around and set another short sell trade at the same price of $62.2 and repeat the same routine and \"buy to cover\" at $61. The trade immediately went through. Make me think it's some sort of bug by the bot potentially. I then repeat about 10+ times before i couldn't get my \"short sell\" order filled at the same price. I guess at this point the system/bot/algothrim had caught on. These are all looked like legitimate trade with confirmation # and everything. My friend is saying they gonna take this money back. What do you guys think. Do you think I get to keep all this profit???\n\nbtw all these trades happened within a 10 minutes window.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/9vox53ad8g231.jpg", "created_utc": 1559701687, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bwxg9t/do_i_get_to_keep_this_profit/", "is_self": true}
