It takes \\~25% weekly gainz to hit $1M from $5K in 6 months. Last week the market shit itself and Retard Bot only printed 13% By Tuesday when it gave fail-stop orders to sell, so 13% avg so far = $106K.\n\n***Edit: For new people,*** *since the original posts got removed after hitting the front page of WSB, Retard Bot is retarded code I wrote in JavaScript to fry tendies with. But instead of the 100% loss I expected, I got 100% gainz 3 consecutive weeks paper trading / testing it. Now I'm putting my IRL money on the line with it, more info below.*\n\nOriginal posts:\n\n* [Climbing from $5K to $1Mil in 24 weeks with a retard bot \\[ week 1 \\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gi7tp7/climbing_from_5k_to_1mil_in_24_weeks_with_a/)\n* [$5K to 1 Mil Retard Bot \\[ Week 1 Results \\] \\[+13%\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gkfmp2/5k_to_1_mil_retard_bot_week_1_results_13/)\n\nThis post is long but the important shit is at the top.\n\n[Ultra wide monitor compatible full resolution desktop background for all \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bs](https://preview.redd.it/i4ixunof5iz41.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=13310910157edb640306bb43f60a6c6e474c2e8b)\n\nLast week 2 things happened affecting retard bot.\n\n1. I was banned from WSB by the \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 mods because they thought retard bot was fake.\n2. Jpow made a speech to expect a sideways market until he orders new inkjet cartridges.\n\nOn Tuesday I posted Retard Bot\u2019s monday positions that had made 13% already when #2 happened, I had only trained it to handle a bull market so when the trailing failstops alerted me to sell I pulled out of the positions with the 13% gainz (lol no i didn't, I held like a retard and had to buy SPY puts to ride back up to 15% for the week). This made it to where my only gainz were before I posted the positions Tuesday, so thats why the mods thought it was fake.\n\nSo we reached an agreement that I would only post Retard Bot\u2019s trades live from now on so you all can know this isn\u2019t all \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 wsbgod style bullshit. Fair enough.\n\nI meme and shit about training retard bot with inversed DD because it\u2019s what makes wsb fun, but it\u2019s really a complex program I spent 3 weeks of 12 hour days developing because I\u2019m addicted to seeing green in my RH account. Autistic shit: It is actually JavaScript, powered by Node.js, using clustering to go multi-threaded and leverage every core of every AWS cloud server I load it onto, reporting back to a command and control server that combines progress learned from ML so I can dump money into more and more computational power to speed up the machine learning with some of the tendies I make from it and make Retard Bot less and less retarded every day. **Retard translation:** Runs on Internet Explorer.\n\n**So what happens next?**\n\nRight now retard bot only knows calls. Unless today magically turns into a bull market: I need a week to give Retard Bot the tools to profit in a crab or bear market. I have 4 twelve packs of Mountain Dew, GUH pulled up on YouTube with some lube at the ready, and most of the week off of work. Starting next monday, RB will know how to use not just calls, but puts for severely downward projections, spreads for high volatility upward and downward projections, and iron condors for high volatility sideways projections. And it\u2019ll post its trades in real-time throughout the week as comments to the monday post I make.\n\nI\u2019m gonna use the bear market data from 2000 and \u201808 to make sure the retard bot is \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 enough to be up for the challenge and train it if it\u2019s not.\n\n**What else?**\n\nIntroduction of Starter Mode:\n\nOn the [Friday week 1 results post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gkfmp2/5k_to_1_mil_retard_bot_week_1_results_13/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) a pretty good comment got posted that most of us broke bitchez can relate to:\n\n[Being below $25,000 is a pain in the sack because you can't flip day-trades like a madcunt, lest you get flagged.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gkfmp2/5k_to_1_mil_retard_bot_week_1_results_13/fqsq250/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nI also have this problem. And now that the market's on hard mode since Jpow announced his printer is running out of ink, I can't just sell Retard Bot's positions if the market crashes and the broker flags my day trades.\n\nSo I spent the weekend coding a Starter Mode for Retard Bot, designed for going from $5K to $25K. It cherry picks the very best 3 positions it can find in the final 3 hours of each weekday so if the market crashes, it shouldn't drop much before close so RB can sell the next day or same day if it's a really bad drop and use the 3 day trades quota for the week.\n\nThat's all you \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bs need to know. Go make infinite tendies on deep otm spy puts. Peace bitchez. Until next week.\n\nBut for those of you autistic fucks that need more info than that well here it shitfucking is. I got asked so many questions and PMs when the last two posts for week 1 hit WSB front page, I wanna address them all so you tardfucks can stop blowing up my in-box.\n\n**Project Map**\n\n1. Pass real time analysis of a gecko's eating patterns into retard bot's machine learning system to project current upcoming market sentiment\n2. Add support for spreads. A co-worker kept telling me they're better, and make time work for you, theta, IV, something something, which was boring so I didnt care. But then I read [a DD confirming this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gk3bq3/a_basic_introduction_to_vertical_spreads_stop/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) which obviously makes it fact.\n3. If the retard keeps shitting out gainz, I build a free website and app so you autists can watch its shit choices in real time. Any excuse to not watch your own accounts shit out more red than that wedding in GoT.\n\n**FAQ**\n\n>**Q:** [If you see results, would you make this available to us all? I just checked and retardbot.com is available.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gi7tp7/climbing_from_5k_to_1mil_in_24_weeks_with_a/fqd58aa/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)  \n>  \n>***A:*** Yes, if the retard keeps shitting out tendies, I will publish a free app and website for wsb that shares retard bot's live trades. [So I bought it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gi7tp7/climbing_from_5k_to_1mil_in_24_weeks_with_a/fqd5nda/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**Q:** [Are you profiteering off wsb with a penny stock pump n dump scheme or market manipulation?](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gi7tp7/climbing_from_5k_to_1mil_in_24_weeks_with_a/fqd8p98?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)  \n>  \n>***A:*** Retard bot can't play penny stocks. Its retarded so I only gave it a list of the top 100 stocks so it wouldnt lose all my money. It also only touches high volume stuff, lower volume decreases its likelihood of buying an option. And now it\u2019s learning spreads, which are black magic fuckery far too complicated for us austic SPY put warriors to understand. But according to some DD I read somewhere, people mirroring your spread positions doesn\u2019t inflate the value like it can with calls (Hence the \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 ULTA guy\u2019s gainz). Nothing Retard Bot touches will be susceptible to market manipulation even if all million of us broke \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bs join our combined wellfare checks on the same position. Furthermore:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**Q:** [Should I mirror Retard Bot's plays?](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gi7tp7/climbing_from_5k_to_1mil_in_24_weeks_with_a/fqdbuh8?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)  \n>  \n>***A:*** Fuck no. This is not financial advice. Suggesting that could be considered market manipulation, which we all know is against SEC rules and more importantly WSB rules. Retard Bot is for entertainment purposes only. But in case any of you shitfucks are gonna try and mirror plays from some retarded fuckin JavaScript bot trained by WSB DD, powered by Internet Explorer, let's look at the next Q&A:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**Q:** [I bought your shitty crm call. What a flop](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gkfmp2/5k_to_1_mil_retard_bot_week_1_results_13/fqrhppv/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)  \n>  \n>***A:*** I made +65% and +91% on those shitty CRM calls monday by 3:10 EST. Bought them between 9AM-11AM.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The TECH call started at 0.01 that's why it's fucky](https://preview.redd.it/5wqnzh5s5iz41.png?width=250&format=png&auto=webp&s=df35e87b1612d7a3ecb4201df0fac5205e462b58)\n\n>In the first three weeks retard bot selected positions that unanimously held 100%+ weekly profit without selling, but *that's not what it's designed to do.* It's called Retard Bot not genius bot, it follows momentum and quality, but you bought on Tuesday when I posted and by that time the market was in free fall. **You bought calls during a market crash dipshit.**\n\n**!!!! EMERGENCY DD FOR TOP WSB RETARDS !!!!**\n\nBefore you fuckshits go mirror Retard Bot's plays anyway like retard humans, some shit to consider:\n\n* Notice retard bot buys a bunch of diverse positions for the budget set so far ($5K)? Thats because if it's wrong about one, the rest are still likely to print. Mirroring just one position of 5-10 is a far worse risk vs reward scenario than buying all of them.\n* The market is unpredictable, and a bot can perform lightning fast fail-safe sales when things go bad, with zero emotion. Our dumb asses tend to scream \u201cdiamond hands\u201d while we watch our savings swirl their final lap around the toilet bowl. GUH\n* There's not enough data yet, since its inception Retard Bot has been tested (until this upcoming monday) in a mostly bull market, there's no way 100% weekly gains last forever and there will eventually be a loss week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Q: How does it work? Is there a GitHub repo? Can you share the code? I'm a developer and I'd like to work with you on this.  \n>  \n>A: Of course you would. If things stay even a tiny fraction of their current retard level, that makes it worth a shitfuckton of tendies. I'm not giving out the code. I'm not sharing my whole algorithm. But I have shared [some details on how it works](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gi7tp7/climbing_from_5k_to_1mil_in_24_weeks_with_a/fqd8sos/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) without giving away the secrets. **ELI5:** It looks for the best stocks based on volatility performance and uses that to conservatively form a momentum-based strike projection. **end ELI5.** For those still curious: Based on that, the current growth estimate of the option is calculated in relation to the intrensic value of the option at expiry if it follows the conservatively projected trend. A score is figured from those metrics in a machine learning based way. After a few more steps of scoring some secret sauce metrics are used to polish up those results. Neural networks are then added dynamically to find relationships between thousands of factors and the model's successful choices, sort of like post-processing. During this process millions of variations of the model exist competing for the best performance. Different models perform better in different market conditions and even in different industries. Top performing models are dynamically linked to different market conditions and even specific stocks. Based on those conditions, different models are given different portions of the cash pool to invest based on the correlation between their success and the market conditions. Once I add spreads and condors and other tools, different model categories will evolve and the best performers will be ranked market-condition dependent. I omitted enough key details that are pretty integral to the system to make sure Wallstreet big brains arent given what they need to come close to replicating what I built. I won't be making any more comments on the topic.\n\nIf retard bot stays performing above 3% weekly, I plan to feed it till it's \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 ass \ud83c\udf08s out yacht money, and I'm inviting every one of you fucktards to party on it.", "created_utc": 1589798590.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/glz5pi/retard_bot_unbanned_by_mods_5k_to_106k_paused_for/", "is_self": true}
