{"id": "fwmyt7", "title": "I've switched to puts.", "selftext": "FACT:  The S&P hit its low on 03/23/20.\n\nALLEGED FACT:  [Using the RSI, lows are tested again 28 days later (median)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/canaccords-dwyer-expects-market-retest-221658700.html)\n\nFACT:  28 days after 03/23/20 is fucking 4/20.  FOUR-TWENTY!  It's destiny!\n\nFACT:  [S&P 2,792 is a 50% retracement](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/$SPX/cheat-sheet). We're pretty much there today.  I'm not saying retracement always works but it is a retracement.\n\nTherefore, 2,792 seems like a great place to switch to puts hoping that the market retests the lows around 4/20.\n\nSince I don't want the theta decaying me in the ass on 4/20, I want my puts to be more than 45 days after 4/20, which is 06/04/20.  So do I want the 6/19's or the 6/30's?  I'm taking the 6/30's to give myself a little more time just in case it turns out that the stock market isn't an exact science that some random guy can just make money on this easily.\n\n**SPY Puts 6/30 240 strike (inverse of 4/20 and giving me a little room just in case it hits 225, not 220.  I plan to sell when we test 220 again**\n\nPS - the market is also forward-looking so right now we're thinking \"the next step is for the virus to start going away so things will be okay after all\" but the next step on 4/20 will be \"the virus has started going away so we'll be okay after all but the economy is going to have to work some of this shit out and that's bad\"", "created_utc": 1586275104.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fwmyt7/ive_switched_to_puts/", "is_self": true}
