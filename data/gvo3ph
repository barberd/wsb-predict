There has been an acceleration toward this reality but it's still early in the overall development cycle.\n\nPhysical and monetary assets being virtualized has recently been accelerated in importance and this will have positive effects, across time, on businesses that focus on securing those assets in its time spent delivering on multiple ultra-high-speed networks across the world. Computing is getting cheaper and easier to distribute in rather extreme ways and the execution of these ideas is happening right now.\n\nThe need for secure video, transactions, VR, and user experiences will be dramatically shot up and this is evident across many exciting technologies like Apple VR, Google Gaming, Square Banking, Facebook Shops with VR shopping, Microsoft software automations, and government developments.\n\nInfrastructure that support these interactive ecosystems will be growing at incredible rates. NET is one of the best positioned companies to pioneer this market.\n\n[The networking market](https://mordorintelligence.com/images_db/RD_Images/1556091324027_Picture2.png)\n\n# # My motivation\n\nCloudFlare is releasing and bolstering support for streaming, video, and communications as a security-first cloud provider in the following week. This, on top of its rapidly growing developer platform, is consequential for many reasons as a market-mover in the industry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# # In Short\n\nCloudFlare so far has been shredding forward across multiple technical markets competing against by:\n\n* \\- Competing marketshare against CISCO, Palo Alto Networks, and other hardware customers\n* \\- Offering a way to not lock your organization into a big tech vendor\n* \\- Promoting security and challenging Big Tech's direction with web development\n* \\- Forming positive relationships with Shopify, Facebook, JD, Twitter, Baidu, TOR, and Microsoft\n* \\- Pioneering the ease-of-use privacy movement with [1.1.1.1](https://1.1.1.1/) and distributing VPNs.\n* \\- Growing a rapid, robust, cost-effective, and secure network across the world\n* \\- **\\*\\*Providing a development platform that promotes the use extremely powerful and 'cutting edge' computing. -> YOU ARE HERE**\n* Creating a better internet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Cofounder of NPM - a module system where software developers shipped code.

A content delivery network.\n\nCDNs are distributed datacenters. This technology has been rapidly improving in the past 5 years and has drastically reduced the cost of business for small businesses and enterprises alike.\n\nThinking trucking logistics. You need to load up and send heavy duty materials, safely, quickly, and across multiple checkpoints along a highway.\n\nAn easy way to think about CDNs is to imagine it as the E in 4G LTE (Long Term Evolution). Through the power of CDNs, you're able to render images, videos, streams, content, data, transactions, privacy, and much more through the network.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Securing digital assets on a reliable infrastructure for the most intensive computing cases.](https://preview.redd.it/dnpn9c3t4m251.png?width=2210&format=png&auto=webp&s=2be51c709a803d5dbac47c4bb471d9ca77bc047c)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# # Why does this market matter? Competitive advantages\n\nThe reason Snapchat did not gain any traction outside of the US was because Facebook provided a fundamentally faster service across WhatsApp and Instagram. Facebook's investment in networking infrastructure allowed them to create a product that was fast , cheap and would work in various rural or economic conditions. Snapchat never stood a chance in the global social media landscape as a result.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# # What's special about CloudFlare as a network?\n\nWhat CloudFlare specifically offers against its competitors is its privacy-first approach. CloudFlare is essentially a distributed private network (VPN) with a massive infrastructure effort to send data around the world safely and cheaply. Privacy and speed sells.\n\n[Facebook: \"The future is private\"](https://preview.redd.it/gn6ibx4p4m251.png?width=1306&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a88aa1e694ab0e62af8856bdeae914f62cd7182)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Cloudflare grows with security](https://preview.redd.it/me09oa3pem251.png?width=2332&format=png&auto=webp&s=658486274c4b3c61fa689c5166b14f8c5775a953)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# # What is serverless computing?\n\nServerless computing allows a 25 year old developer like me run 5 different businesses on my dinky little Macintosh while I let Google and Cloudflare run my servers under an extremely cheap pricing model.
