{"id": "fg3klz", "title": "Amazon to sell their cashierless store technology to other retailers: \"Just Walk Out\"", "selftext": "Amazon's [Just Walk Out website](https://justwalkout.com/). Why does the website look like it was put together from an intern giving no fucks at all? NO FUCKING CLUE, but this shit is about to upend the retail market. Amazon is about to AWS their Go stores and sell their cashierless technology to other retailers. Hope you're not a cashier cause your job is running out of time. \n\nWhy is this such a big deal for Amazon? **The more stores that use this technology, the more data that Amazon gets on consumer shopping habits.** AND HERE'S THE BONKERS THING: this technology will let Amazon collect metrics on *everything* consumers are doing in a store. They'll get metrics on how often a consumer picks an item up, then puts it down. They'll get walk path metrics to help stores optimize their browsing. Shit, they'll probably come up with entirely new metrics that we're all too autistic to even predict right now. Advertising was already one of Amazon's fastest growing market segments, and now they're about to have some of the highest quality product data possible. \n\nTl;dr, get fucked FAANG, 100% all in on Amazon.", "created_utc": 1583794355.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fg3klz/amazon_to_sell_their_cashierless_store_technology/", "is_self": true}
