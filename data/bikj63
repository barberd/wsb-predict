Picks are generated from that scan. Those scans are ran through scripts that check certain volatility skews. These are my own scripts, and I won't divulge much more than that about it. The indicative theory here is sell IV when it's high and buy IV when it's low, follow trends and follow the big money (I rarely list my credit spread plays, because I don't want someone to blow their retirement out of the water based on my advice). Volatility is literally the most important aspect in options pricing and finding positive EV situations. A few of the criteria for the ToS scans are:\n\n* Market cap of $5B+\n* Daily volume of 1M+\n* Volume, volume differential, RSI, 52 week low's and high's, ToS sizzle, and a few others decide what comes out of the scan, then selected as a pick based on script results/current market conditions/sentiment.\n\n# My Project Update\n\nA lot of you ask me if I have anywhere outside of here you can follow me on, etc. Follow me on my reddit profile, first of all, that's where you'll get anything in the future. Yeah I'm working on a blog and stuff but I'm a busy dude in real life and it's taken a back seat to my real clients and obligations. I'm still working on it. No, I won't share it here - mods have explicitly said no, so leave it there and **don't bother them about it.** That being said, I plan on making somewhere to share thoughts outside of this post, yes, it's coming, yes, but I'm busy as fuck with my business(es) and clients, meetings, etc.\n\n# Some Thoughts About Last Week \n\n**What a week it was.** Mostly all the picks last week worked out in real time, same week which isn't always the case. Those of you that bought Twitter from a few weeks back on the longer dated option (which I always recommend) probably did pretttttty good with it. These picks don't necessarily always start this week, or end this week. These are the ideas that have crafted new trade theories based on what I believe to be true. Entering at the right time is an art, and I've spoken about this so many times but:\n\nI cannot teach you how to trade. Only how to pick things to trade. The trading is the hard part - we're not investing -- we're trading. Essentially it's high level gambling: Knowing when to hold 'em and knowing when to fold 'em is what this game is about.\n\n**Just because a stock is listed here doesn't mean you blindly just enter a fucking trade on it.** Look for the entry, look for the catalysts, take advantage of sector moves or other binary events, take advantage of pullbacks or consolidation to look for a price. Set stop limits and don't blow your load on weeklies because there's very few cases where they work well (Disney anybody).\n\n**The trend is your friend.**\n\n# About Playing Earnings Events\n\nPeople ask how I normally trade earnings, are you selling? are you holding? what are you doing? etc. Here's my formula, it may or may not work for you but this is traditionally what I do.\n\nAny earnings events I play, I'm normally in on the first sign of an uptrend/downtrend in the 2 week window prior to earnings OR I'm playing by letting earnings dictate the trend, and buying after the IV crush happens.\n\n**THE TREND IS YOUR FRIEND.**\n\nRemember: The **ENTIRE** predicating factor in my plays is normally to catch higher periods of volatility at the right time, to profit not only on a move, but on the increase in Vega value of the option. Buying FD's the day before an earnings report is the opposite of this and while it SEEMS like it's your only way to make a 10-bagger happen, it couldn't be further from the truth.\n\nBeing in BEFORE the volatility allows me to simply liquidate a portion of the contracts for a profit, sometimes regardless of it even going slightly against the current price (average doooooown).\n\n**I recommend finding a strategy that works for you and executing it.** If you buy 0-day or front month/front week FD's on earnings and lose, you should NOT be surprised. I'd say you likely are going to lose on 75%+ of those trades, moderately profit on about 90% of the remaining, and pop off on 10% of the remaining 25% (2.5% of the time). Unless you have killer DD or a reason to think the market is pricing in too low of a move, you **CANNOT BEAT THE PRICING MODEL.** For you to win, something has to be wrong, skewed, mis-priced, you must know something about the company that you think analysts/market makers are wrong on, or you have to be advantageously positioned greek wise so that regardless what happens, you win.\n\nResearch **price neutral strategies** (butterflies and calendar spreads, specifically, I hate condors but you can look those up too) if you want a way to be **SHORT VEGA** without investing as much capital. I could write fucking pages on strategies, but I won't, and you should learn some about them on your own and fuck them up a few times before you figure out the right places to play them.\n\n**I bolded the words you need to research.** I'm not commenting anymore on strategy stuff here. Most people still won't listen to this anyway, but...\n\n**A specific example:** I bought June MSFT $145 calls at $0.04 a piece, 40 of them, and then a chunk of $135's throughout the last couple days of the week before earnings. My scans showed that they were mis-priced and skewed, you couldn't have known this, but you can easily just by using intuition find these kinds of deals. They exist, trust me. Those $145 calls are now like $0.15 I think? But they were also $0.12 right before earnings, both because of the move up, but secondarily because of the Vega pump on the options. They barely moved in value after earnings, as the crush offset a lot of the price movement. I sold half (20) the day before earnings for 200%, and basically freerolled the rest. I sold a chunk between $0.14 and $0.16 after earnings, and still have 10 of them that I will iron fist until they go to 0 or make a grand or so. The trade is already profitable, I've locked that in, and I get to ride the lotto ticket on the house. I have two months to watch and decide if I really want to let them wipe themselves out or just take some more cash and move on.\n\n**Buying price directional and holding, mathematically modeled, is a losing strategy when used by itself with no other factors taken into effect.** The smart traders will see this statement for what it means, others will see it to mean that you can't buy directional plays. The ones that see it the first way are learning how to trade, the ones that see it the other way are the gamblers.\n\n# Results On Last Week's Picks\n\n**Microsoft (MSFT) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Opened week: $122.62, Closed: $129.89, High: $131.37\n\n* Win. We know all about the good news and movement, I think it still has room to go but it's definitely going to find consolidation near 130 and chill for even another day or two longer than it has before it continues up. Pullback to 128-127 doesn't concern me and I'll just hold all my calls regardless. Looking at the movement of it, it's not completely out of the question to see one after earnings. I'd feel comfortable just bag holding my June calls until probably the middle of May, if it's still flat then, I feel like the cushion I've built is worth the risk for more upside here. I don't imagine it crashing down to 115 or anything, unless the entire market comes down with it.\n\n**Verizon (VZ) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Opened week: $58.14, Closed: $56.58, H: $58.49 (pointless, as it was pre-market)\n\n* Yeah so they beat or whatever but it's a telecom company and their guidance was meh and the results were meh. I lost 60% on this trade, and just decided I'd rather not watch for it or navigate it anymore. Can't win them all.\n\n**UnitedHealth (UNH) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Opened week: $224.00, Closed: $237, H: $237.11\n\n* ***I got really lucky here.*** The timing was just pure luck that it occurred the week I listed it but it popped off and rose pretty much all week. I think that it's probably going to continue the trend as long as there's volume behind it because of the reasons listed last week: The assets and forward looking potential revenue are not reflected in the stock's price. \n\n**Tesla (TSLA) -** ***BEARISH*** \\- Opened week: $269.00, Closed: $235.14, L: $231.13\n\n* **This one made me feel like a prophet.** Let's quote myself: \"It's always just a matter of time before they go back to $230 because of a car blowing up or somebody saying something stupid.\" $230ish? Check. Tesla exploded? Check. Tesla said stupid things about leaf blowers? Check. Print print print.\n\n**Facebook (FB) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Opened week: $178.25, Closed: $191.49, H: $198.48\n\n* Facebook had really stellar numbers in my opinion. Eventually, growth in USA has to stall and it did. The international numbers were fine, and the fact they're taking the front looking \"Let's fight the privacy battle together\" stance is great for sentiment and allows fund managers to freely continue piling into shares if they want to without their clients going SJW on them. I think the pullback is, well, whatever. People taking profit as they climb back near where they were last year, so wait for some high volume trading and an increase in price and this one still has room to make money. Sold half my calls for like 100%+ and the other half for a -2% loss because I held through the fall from grace for a day or two.\n\n**Intel (INTC) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Opened week: $58.15, Closed: $52.43, H: $59.29\n\n* Buy the dip in my opinion. Not gonna say much else here but the semis are under pressure -- but I think Intel is more isolated from the general semi companies solely because they'll always sell chips. Some of the old 1080ti cards that Nvidia sold are still running perfect and strong and the new gen offers an increase but not as incremental as people wanted. That being said, I think Nvidia is fine but they're a lot more prone to slowdowns than a company like Intel. I don't know when they'll stabilize, could be days or weeks, but when they do I'd look to profit on the move back up. China trade deal could be a big catalyst proxy play here.\n\n# The Picks for Week of April 29th, 2019\n\n**All of the commentary on specific tickers are simply notes I wrote to myself.** Each ticker listed is not a suggestion to buy or sell, but simply the ones I took notes on that I'm considering entering. These notes are not to you personally. These are not complete transcriptions -- simply summaries of my thoughts. Do your own DD.  I may or may not enter trades on these or may already be in them. The bottom of the post has the options I'm long on, as a secondary holding disclaimer.\n\nThere was a witch hunt in the Daily Discussion thread claiming I retroactively edit my posts HAHA like I give a fuck or something... I called Twitter, I don't really care what anybody says. Feels good from my side, BRAH. I don't list every play I make, just the ones I feel like the community would be most interested in playing. I don't mention the premium I may be selling (but will list it if it's on any of the options listed) and I don't mention any other neutral strategies I'm holding if they're not in these stocks.\n\nI typed less commentary about each stock because there's so many this week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Microsoft (MSFT) - $129.89 -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Trend is your friend (anybody see a theme here?). Consolidation commencing, I plan on just holding my calls. Ride the wave. Numbers are good, Azure is growing, and if somehow before June that JEDI contract gets handed out and they get it, it goes up, hard and fast just the way I like it.\n\n* **Plays I'm Looking At -** Holding my calls. Maybe adding more that are 10% or so OTM but knowing full well I may lose on them because it has to move, but if it does the payoff seems pretty immense and Mickey like.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Oracle (ORCL) - $55.41 -** ***BULLISH*** *-* For me, Oracle is kind of a proxy play and a momentum play. \n\nThere has been a pretty nice sized volume move on Oracle as of late and some of the bigger funds are adding to their holdings. The fact that Oracle is pretty cloud-driven, besides their enterprise on-site data storage (which is very much likely moving towards cloud based offerings) and that the data sector and cloud industry is booming ($TEAM anybody? Looks like it's climbing right back where it was after the ridiculous earnings selloff) I think it means they have a chance to start increasing market share. As a result, as more and more people buy into this theory, the price will rise as a forward looking idea and price it in. For me, the price is $56, if it can get over that and close there, the swing play is in full effect for me. It's right at new 52W highs and to me (trend, friend) and with any luck, the volume will hold up and we'll see it plow upwards further.\n\n* **Plays I'm Looking At -** Specifically, some May monthly contracts at various strikes. Pick your poison, ROI comes with more risk, so the further out, the more risk. I'm pretty likely to just buy right ATM, and double down on some out of the money ones if it starts going for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Nvidia (NVDA) - $178.09 -** ***BULLISH*** *-* BUYYYY THEEEE DIPPPPP. \n\nI am completely ignoring any 'market sector weakness' people are talking about in semis. It's cyclical, yes, and that's something to be cognizant of. I'm going to wait for the price to stabilize Monday and wait and see if any binary news pops its head out, orange man says something about China, etc. and make a decision if I want to enter or keep waiting. Ideally, it will go down even more, because Nvidia, AMD, Intel, etc. are going to be hugeeeeee benefactors to the trade deal news. **They report 5/16 and the fact the stock really hasn't moved much on a 2 month rolling basis, there seems to be upside on the idea of China, in and of itself.**\n\n* **Plays I'm Looking At -** Calls, various strikes, might even consider weeklies here because I'm playing it as a swing. I don't want to personally throw a few thousand at like 2020 calls and have to let them sit there to profit 100%. I'd rather just take a few shots at weeklies, or front month stuff, and see if I can catch a swing and just be appropriate each day or two and close out positions that are moving towards 20-50% losses, and take a few shots at it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Disney (DIS) - $139.92 -** ***BULLISH*** *-* It's Mickey, mother fuckers. \n\nSaw Endgame, movie was pretty badass. They're going to enter a string of great movies, with Lion King also coming this year. Could they sell the news Monday? Sure, but idgaf. Mickey's my bro and I ride or die with him. If you don't know the updates here with Disney+ and what not, you're out of the loop and you should stop trading options. Nuff said imo. **They report next week, so it's important to pay attention to the fact that earnings and guidance COULD disappoint versus the share price at the time, and trigger a fat pullback. It's all risk/reward.**\n\n* **Plays I'm Looking At -** Throw a dart at a list of price strikes and buy them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Electronic Arts (EA) - $94.47 -** ***BULLISH*** \\- We talked about this one a week ago? I think. Or two weeks. \n\nEither way, it started to find that bottom entry point. People keep asking if I'm concerned about Anthem. Those that are asking that I assume are gaming enthusiasts that watch a lot of clickbait YouTube videos and pay too much attention to what some random neckbeard think about the games that come out. The company made a killing on Apex (BUT THE BATTLE PASS!!!!! OMG, same shit, just shut up because people still bought it) and the number of people that I saw buying in game currency BEFORE the battle pass is immense. \n\nThey could not have imagined that they got to the player base they did so fast and more importantly the stock did not drop because of ANY of these reasons. It dropped because of the Origin security flaw. Flaw's fixed. Price hasn't gone back up. Not priced in. **They report NEXT WEEK so if I'm going to up my position it will be this week, not next.**\n\n* **Plays I'm Looking At -** June or even later calls. I'm spread from strikes currently 115-125. I might even go deeper in the chain and bet on insane action in the next month. Depends how spicy I feel and whether Taco Tuesday is any good this week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Square (SQ) - $71.55 -** ***BULLISH*** \\- **They report Wednesday after market.** A lot of people have heard me talk about this company. I **LOVE** Square. They have good tech and a good platform. I know that they're expanding their service offerings and improving on the software they acquired from Freshbooks. \n\nTheir appointments app is their bread and butter besides the payments fees, and the hardware sales help to push profits higher also. They just got me for like $600? I think or more even for a new iPad/stand setup. It just works well. This segways me to mention that if and when Stripe comes into the market as far as IPOs, be careful about being in Square or PayPal. Stripe is going to fucking crush it, they are the holy grail fintech company in my opinion.\n\n* **Plays I'm Looking At -** Kind of sketch to get in now if you aren't, so I may just sell premium on these and then buy upside calls with the profits after earnings, but I'm not 100% yet. I'll probably YOLO in on weeklies or something just because I can't help myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Alaska Air (ALK) - $60.62 -** ***BULLISH*** *-* They just ate some price target cuts after earnings but I feel like analysts are pricing in the idea of a wide market pullback and the impacts of Boeing on the company. That being said I really like Alaska as a company and when I do fly, it's normally Alaska anywhere I go. Their price target cuts are still 15% or so above where the stock sits, and if the entire sector gets any type of positive news, they'll pop up along with Delta ($DAL) and Southwest ($LUV).\n\n* **Plays I'm Looking At -** June or July's, trying to pick the strike that I feel they can reach, not surpass, and then selling a large portion of my position if they approach the price closely. In my opinion and modeling, $70.52 is the price my algorithm spit out at me. I won't say what goes into it, and I won't say what variables I set as the projection so don't ask, **and it means ABSOLUTELY nothing** but I just hate going against my computer because it turns into a snarky bitch when it's right and I'm wrong. Either way, seems like the options aren't that pricy, although the spreads are kind of fucked on these. If you don't get a good fill on a dip at open when the bid spread crashes and rips the ask price down with it, then you probably won't find an advantageous position here. It's more lotto ticket than buying FD's on Square, honestly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Exxon Mobil (XOM) - $80.49 -** ***BEARISH*** *-* While the rest of the oil sector is buying itself up and combining companies into conglomerates even further, Exxon has shown some decided weakness and off their last earnings report, I'd be willing to say we see a dip here that I'm willing to jump on the train for. \n\nIt all depends on risk tolerance though because I'm kind of betting against a hot market with where oil prices are at and it's completely possible the market 100% ignores everything that is out there on the company and is completely irrational and the price just goes up. Sure, crude pulled back but it's still way above where it was in recent months, so to me, that would signal that guidance for these companies could be getting sandbagged for the next round of earnings, so keep this in mind because they probably aren't re-working guidance based on oil pricing fluctuations but rather a range and probability model of the prices in certain economic conditions in similar years.\n\n* **Plays I'm Looking At -** Another spot where I'm willing to sling a bit at a 3-5% move on weeklies for puts because they're really not that expensive and people/algos will freak out over the Trump ceiling on the oil market. I'm personally considering following up the weeklies with some that are longer expiration, at a deeper strike, and rolling my weeklies along the way until I decide I've lost/made enough on the trade. Oil markets kind of a bitch sometimes and I have a slight vendetta against it for life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Occidental (OXY) - $61.31 -** ***BEARISH*** *-* I'm going against the grain with this company because they continually are in the news and have allowed themselves to enter a bidding war with Chevron now over Anadarko. \n\nChevron will likely win this battle for the reason that I have a inkling that there's some options written into the deal for executives which would explain why they may take a lower priced offer for the company. If this happens, it will make Occidental appear snubbed and like a bitch, and thus, the price will go down because shareholders will lose faith in the ability of the board to get a deal done. Moreover, they've raised their bid and showed they're willing to pay more, so Chevron could bid this way the fuck up and if the bidding war doesn't stop -- shareholders traditionally don't like a company paying way more for something just because someone bullied them into it.\n\n* **Plays I'm Looking At -** This is another play I like shorter term holdings on. I'll probably buy puts and hold for a day or two, and roll some profits if they win or pick a different entry. I'd like to see lower volume on the day or timeframe I decide to enter, it would show me people aren't really trading it and stockholders or algo's could sell it off in anticipation of the entire situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Spotify (SPOT) - $138.25 -** ***BEARISH*** \\- **They report tomorrow before market.** \n\nDon't take my bearish stance on Spotify to mean that I think the company is poorly run or a bad company. I think Spotify is a GREAT company but I've spoken to three girls this week that exclusively use Apple Music now because it's 'convenient'. Their family plan also seems to have impacted their ability to get individuals to buy accounts because I'm sharing one with three friends, none of which live under the roof with me. Combined with the fact that Apple Music is indeed growing just as fast as they say it is, and taking market share, I think it's only a matter of time before Spotify tops out on growth. The stock isn't cheap or competitively priced anything so there has to be really positive news and guidance to go up.\n\n* **Plays I'm Looking At -** So it's too late to get any options for earnings on this BUT, I can easily play a swing on the report and draw a thesis, even if I'm wrong. It's possible that at open, there's still a play to be made but I'm definitely waiting for the IV to settle down.\n\n# State of the Market\n\nWe're going to get to those all time highs sooner or later. I hope it's sooner because a lot of plays I have are kind of betting on the short term being to the upside above those highs. I think that there's piles of opportunities right now, and I think we're going to see volatility greatly increase this week and next as May approaches. There's little question that the sideways action represents some type of wide-spreading accumulation and consolidation, so the question is will the people accumulating for the next move upwards on the S&amp;P be stronger than those taking profit? If so, we make all time highs and continue cruising. If not? See you in a few weeks 2,700.\n\n# About Correlated/Corresponding Picks\n\nCorrelated picks are important. An example is playing Apple/Facebook/Microsoft and SPY. If any of those gain, it's more likely SPY gains that week since it's weighted towards them, and the S&amp;P is weighted towards them. Calls in both double dips, but can see your money evaporate also. Buying tech sector puts and SPY calls makes no sense, for the exact same rationale unless it's a pure hedge against share value, or an isolated catalyst like a lawsuit or acquisition, in which case, it's probably going to pull the ETF/index down or up with it anyway. The best way to double dip is to find complimentary positions. Example: Verizon on top of Apple is good - if their streaming service is good and requires iPhone hardware, the market may see a boost in iPhone sales from Verizon and ATT, etc. Corresponding plays.\n\n# Should I Hold Or Sell?\n\nFigure it out on your own. I can't tell you what's right for you nor do I care to. You have to learn to trade on your own, if this DD doesn't get you moving forward enough and you can't draw up a plan on how to trade it, then that's your problem and trading that stock or trading in general ***may not be for you.*** **To get better at this, play in markets you know well. Don't try to find the next Disney, play in stocks that move and behave somewhat rationally, and plan where you're entering and where you're exiting.**\n\n# Will You Cover This Ticker/Give Me Your Thoughts On This?\n\n**BEFORE YOU ASK FOR A TICKER:** Lots of people ask for the same thing, I don't mind adding color commentary on specifics if you have a question about a certain aspect of the company, but please just load all the comments and CTRL+F (CMD+F for Mac) and look for that ticker to see if there's a conversation going on about it already.\n\nIf you've got something you are eyeing, I'll occasionally be willing to offer my thoughts on the company and the underlying. **I can not, and will not tell you when to enter/exit/buy/sell any stock or option,** however. I will simply say what I think about the specific ticker and their outlook. Once again, it is simply **my opinion and not advice.** **If you ask for a ticker overview, include the ticker symbol with a $, like $AAPL,** so I can just search the thread for them. If you ask me specifically for advice on your own position, or situation, I'll simply ignore your comment.\n\n# Private Messages/Chat Requests\n\nI may or may not respond. Depends if the question is stupid or not.\n\n# Holdings Disclaimer\n\nOn listed plays: I am already hold various combinations of positions on Oracle (long/neutral), Microsoft (long), EA (long) and Disney (long).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: I'm going to go through and fix up typos and formatting after I eat pizza and salad and watch GoT.", "created_utc": 1556511177, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bikj63/i_pick_options_so_you_dont_have_to_week_beginning/", "is_self": true}
