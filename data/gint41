I have no way of figuring out DLC sales, so I\u2019d assume that these games also have additional sales based on that. There\u2019s also GTA online, NBA 2k online, and Red Dead online, all of which are fairly popular. TakeTwo has other games as well, but these are the most popular. Clearly, GTA V is their bread and butter, but NBA and RDR2 are doing fairly well. GTA V is also #7 on twitch\u2019s most popular games.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome google trends:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GTA V - current search popularity higher than holiday season](https://preview.redd.it/6dpnnt44bfy41.png?width=1418&format=png&auto=webp&s=72a39ebc737219e6170aba5fd92f1dfaffe7a2a9)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Civ 6](https://preview.redd.it/ejogx53bbfy41.png?width=1432&format=png&auto=webp&s=30bea8679ac8c6075ce0762963033b96221a3776)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[NBA 2k20 - Only surpassed by release date](https://preview.redd.it/74xk57xdbfy41.png?width=1403&format=png&auto=webp&s=c209fe188f0a018f7c68186529937852442646a2)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Other competitors:**\n\nTaketwo has beaten earnings estimates for the last 3 quarters in a row. Their projected Q1 EPS is 0.56. EA and Activision both also beat earnings this quarter and we\u2019re all aware of why: everyone is at home and bored out of their mind. Gaming is one of the few things that there is to do. Microsoft\u2019s CEO stated recently that Xbox live use was almost at an all-time high. Furthermore, Ttwo isn\u2019t as reliant as EA or Activision for yearly releases. I touched on this before, but GTA online, Red Dead online, and NBA 2k online generate tons of revenue for Taketwo in the form of microtransactions. NBA 2k online will be livestreamed on ESPN2, for example and it has 50 million users in China alone. GTA online has shown increasing revenue growth. 2019 Q4 has an increase of 54% in revenue from recurrent purchasers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Financials:**\n\nNo long-term debt. Assets, revenues, and net income have been going up. They\u2019ve continued to repurchase their stock.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**However...** they're already at their ATH and they haven't had any big blockbuster release this quarter. Activation had COD drop meanwhile EA had nothing major. The big difference may just be revenue from microtransaction but I'm too stupid to figure out how to calculate that. IV is also fairly high right now for their options.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow are you all gambling on this?", "created_utc": 1589328715.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gint41/taketwo_ttwo_the_next_activision_or_the_next_ea/", "is_self": true}
