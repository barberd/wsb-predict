Like just under 70% since this time last year.\"\n\nCramer: \"Ohh thahthas great news. Fantastic.\"\n\nProducer: \"Well I have bad news.\"\n\nCramer: \"Give it to me.\"\n\nProducer: \"Almost all of the increase in viewership can be contributed to one group of people... and likely, these people are barely people at all.\"\n\nCramer: \"Whhahaat do you mean barely people, barely people at all...??? Like aliens?\"\n\nProducer: \"Worse. W E A P O N I Z E D R E T A R D S.\"\n\nCramer: \"...\"\n\nProducer: \"We first noticed a high spike in viewership immediately after you mentioned Virgin Galatic, ticker $SPCE.\"\n\nCramer: \"I know the fucking ticker dipshit. My people have been in this game for 35 years. Don't ever doubt my market knowledge again or am I going to make you man the phone lines and answer calls from Meredith from DOWN IN ALABAMA who is worried about her 266 shares of Johnson and Johnson she bought back in 1944 by fucking her way around town for 3 years and selling her husband's Crystler Thunderbolt Roadster who never came back from the war. I know you don't want to listen to her bitch that she would rather hold onto the stock for a few more years and not miss out on any gains while she doesn't even realize the stock has gone through multiple splits and through dividend reinvestment that she's holding a 9,600 bagger of $96 million while still living in a fucking shack and shitting in an outhouse? \n\nProducer: \"Is this why you never go visit your mom?\"\n\nCramer: \"You have no idea what it's like out there. NONE!\"\n\nProducer: \"Well, they are part of a forum called wallstreetbets on Reddit and they feed on extremely volatile options. They always aim to get tendies. I think this is monkey speak for pussy.\"\n\nCramer: \"Ok, maybe this is just a group of normmmall peoplee with vveerry high libido and highhh personal risk tolerance!\"\n\nProducer: \"That is what we thought too. Until we found out how most of their options picks are made. These retards are following the rudimentary communication hierarchy of chimps. One chimp thinks he may have discovered a new mating call and the other chimps start franticly echoing him without even knowing if it works. Then it spreads like a Chinese man just ate an exotic soup. Soon all of them are repeating the call over and over. A week passes, most of them don't realize that all the mates have been taken and the mating call goes stale.\"\n\nCramer: \"I think I know where you are going here. We need to find out what their next mating call is.\"\n\nProducer: \"Yes but there is a problem. We can't just go on the forum and ask what ticker they are buying.\"\n\nCramer: \"W w why?\"\n\nProducer: \"Because they will call you a faggot and ask if your wife's boyfriend allowed you to post in here.\"\n\nCramer: \"My god. These people are retarded.\"\n\nProducer: \"Yes. But I think I have a solution. We can predict with some accuracy what they may be buying based on their last pick, $SPCE. Due to their retardation, they limit their decision-making criteria to 3 metrics.\"\n\nCramer: \"Ok, so $SPCE. 1) lets you space travel and be an astronaut.  2) don't even have a working spacecraft to take people up in. 3) lost $210 million last year.\"\n\nProducer: \"Yeah, I think that is the three major points about that company\"\n\nCramer: \"So..... it needs to be a company that is involved in something that they all wanted to be when they grew up but none of them actually became,  the actual product or service doesn't even fucking work right now and the company has to be losing millions of dollars.\"\n\nCramer: \"I got it.\"\n\n [https://imgur.com/a/VNLNWZi](https://imgur.com/a/VNLNWZi)", "created_utc": 1591234730.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gw7l0e/fast_money_producer_sits_down_with_jim_cramer_to/", "is_self": true}
