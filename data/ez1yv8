{"id": "ez1yv8", "title": "Qualcomm DD - Earnings Play", "selftext": "With Qualcomm\u2019s earnings coming tomorrow AH, I\u2019m curious what you guys think of a play.\n\nWith their 6-yr deal with Apple they have a stronger revenue projection. Although, they won\u2019t be supplying this until probably end of the year.\n\nThis quarter won\u2019t have much to tell, but analyst already know this and have adjusted earnings expectations to be relatively weak.\n\nFacebook did their earnings and showed a strong growth in their other revenue section which is mainly coming from their Oculus Quest VR sales. This is only about 330m though, but this was for Q4 2019.\n\nQualcomm supplies the Oculus Quest with their snapdragon chipset. The Quest killed sales this year for Christmas selling out everywhere and had a ship date of mid-January around the end of December. This ship date continued to grow through January and is currently now March 3rd. This isn\u2019t due to shipping delays but actual orders (I have a Quest and have just been in general watching the ship date/there\u2019s continuing to be more players online).\n\nQualcomm will focus on 5g and those potentials, but maybe this added revenue can give them a bit of a boost/talking point.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019re playin it or if you have other good info!\n\nTLDR; Calls - Qualcomm supplies Facebook chips for their Oculus Quest VR which sold hella so maybe it\u2019ll boost revenue more than expected to help in earnings", "created_utc": 1580869501, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ez1yv8/qualcomm_dd_earnings_play/", "is_self": true}
