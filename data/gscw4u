Blahblahblah money printer go brrrr... technical analysis of blahblahblah recession is coming. Enough. I need you all to suddenly be smarter. So please read the following. Take an adderall or something, this is important. \n\nIf you are buying options on indexes, or derivatives of indexes, just fucking knock that shit off. It's not a wise investment, even if we are pretending any options play is 'wise'. In fact, it's much, much better to be trading options on individual stocks. \n\nFurther, it is better to be looking at stocks that actually have\\*not\\* gained 100% since March 3. No, it isn't smart to buy puts on these stocks ($W, $CHGG, $OKTA, $LOGI, etc.)\n\nWe are in a **market recovery phase**, not a recession. As someone who actually has a job, and is friends with actual rich people, I can tell you with reasonable confidence what's going on. \n\n1. Quarantine is awesome if you're rich, bc your life didn't change other than you now work from home. If you work. \n2. If you're rich, you want to get richer, and you are salty about the losses you took, and probably are putting **more money into securities now than you had in the market on Jan 1, 2020.** \n3. Many stocks are having a fire sale, and all we have to do to make money is pick some companies that got unfairly hammered by scared little bitch hedge fund managers who pulled their stake when things were uncertain. \n4. New York had an emergency, but many other US cities where rich people live did not. \n5. If you're running a company, or your wealth is sort of treated like a company, you are now keeping more cash on hand (less stonk buybacks), but this money is burning a hole in your pocket... so you keep using it to buy stonks. \n6. If you're rich, you're actually good at making money, so you are taking profits on your $W and $ZOOM positions, and are reinvesting in recovering stocks that have more growth potential in the medium term (end of year)\n   1. Once shit totally settles, lots of money probably goes back to indexes, but we're a long way from that. \n\nI say all this to tell r/wsb to stop thinking from their own perspective, and think like a rich person. Rich people buy securities. Poor people don't. None of the money that mattered has left the market (some of it is sitting as cash, but it's coming right back), and $6 trillion + is getting injected into the economy. It's a race back to 30,000, but individual stocks will recover value during different periods, as different sectors come online. \n\nSo what do you buy? Literally any stock that is undervalued. Here's a short list of the ones I made some money on ( can post screenshots but who cares honestly, this is easier to read):   \n\n\n* UBER - bought at $29.50, holding at \\~$33.50 now. Waiting for some volatility to explore call options\n* CHGG - sorry, this was just me being lucky - bought @ $33.50, sold at $60 (shares only, got cold feet before earnings)\n* ELY - bought and sold so many different plays... god I love golf. Currently holding shares with avg. basis of $13.00, just sold 6/19 $16 calls for 500% (0.15 per contract to 1.00 per)\n* YETI - bought \\~$24, holding at \\~$32 or whatever. Huge growth potential. Rich people buy expensive shit. \n\nJust look for things that sold off, and are on the path to their previous value - nothing really changed for many companies, except that their business was temporarily halted. The investors sold off too severely because everyone was expecting a crash for a long time. The crash is unpredictable. Maybe it happens. Probably it doesn't. If the US gov't has to build a country full of high speed rail lines to put people back to work, they will. There is no weirdness in the market. It's behaving exactly like a rich dad who got spooked by a virus. Initially held onto some cash, now slowly rolling it back in. \n\nTl;dr stocks are going to continue to go up, not all at once, so pick some good tickers and stop posting shitty memes", "created_utc": 1590693991.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gscw4u/overall_market_10000_ft_view/", "is_self": true}
