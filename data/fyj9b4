Check positions at end of post. I\u2019m not here to be chastised for my positions. I know they\u2019re probably retarded and I\u2019m playing with a very minimal amount of disposable income and don\u2019t really give a shit. \n\nAnyone have any good/bad history holding options through reverse splits, whether calls or puts? What can I expect when JNUG undergoes a 10:1 RS on 4/22? Nonetheless, unless my options go up in price exponentially before RS, I\u2019m holding til they\u2019re worthless. Again, don\u2019t really give a shit. \n\nBelow is some history of JNUG prices within a month of past reverse splits, so kind of makes me feel a bit better??\n\n-06/28/19 1:5 $60 ($86 AT 07/18/19)\n-05/01/17 1:4 $83 ($102 AT 05/17/17)\n-10/01/15 1:5  $71 ($121 AT 10/15/15)\n-12/223/14 1:10 $188 ($412 AT 01/20/15)\n\nHope to hear some good or extremely awful past experiences. Thanks, fuck you.\n\nPositions: https://imgur.com/gallery/JOdNt7r", "created_utc": 1586536614.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fyj9b4/what_happens_to_calls_during_a_rs_jnug/", "is_self": true}
