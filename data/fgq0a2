WWE has been consistently dropping since cracking the $100 mark in April. The reasons it ran up (Network subscribers, FOX deal, Saudi deal) are beginning to fail them. \n\nNetwork subscribers have decreased, with more to follow. There are rumors of WWE removing their monthly pay per view shows from the network and selling their rights to a perform , such as ESPN+. This would kill their subscribers, for most of them remain strictly for the PPVs. \n\nFOX deal was massive for WWE (hence the run up to $100) but the shine is off that gem (is that the saying?? Idk) The product blows and ratings reflect that . \n\nThe Saudi deal brought in a bunch of cash (which for the shows to date I\u2019m not sure is paid in full) and terrible publicity. Some of the bigger stars refuse to even perform in Saudi Arabia. Short term the beer virus might affect these bi annual trips.\n\nOver the next few months, it will be interesting to see how the WWE handles the virus fallout. Tampa officials are meeting to discuss how they will handle upcoming events. One particular event coming up is Wrestlemania which would draw 90,000 people. As a wrestling fan , let me tell you, we don\u2019t value hygiene. This many people gathering at once would be a prime breeding ground for the Coronavirus.\n\nTL/DR We wrestling fans are dirty, and Wrestlemania is about to be cancelled. \n4/17 and/or 5/15 puts, $30. Could look longer term for $25", "created_utc": 1583893957.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fgq0a2/world_wrestling_entertainment_wwe_is_primed_to/", "is_self": true}
