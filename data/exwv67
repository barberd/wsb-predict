I bought a number of TSLA shares (not getting into exact number). Along with research and comparing TSLA\u2019s rise to that of Amazon, plus Elon\u2019s being the innovator that he is. I\u2019m thinking that this is an investment that I just let stay where it is. Am I crazy? Should I just forget the stock is even there and go on about my day? It seems to just be money making money at this point.\nPrior to this I\u2019ve never done any stock purchasing on my own. I also purchased some SPCE. \nMy main reasoning was when you ask people about any electric cars or the future of the automobile, they instantly think Tesla. Sort of like Burgers=McDonald\u2019s, or Online shopping=Amazon.\nSide note: I bought in the dip before the recent 400+ climb.", "created_utc": 1580683820, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/exwv67/holding_on_for_the_long_game/", "is_self": true}
