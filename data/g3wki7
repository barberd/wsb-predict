I'm a resident physician in a city that isn't anywhere near as bad as New York right now and holy fuck is the market divorced from the reality on the ground. I missed the boat in mid February because I was working nights and didn't YOLO my savings into puts. Then my order to sell wasn't executed by EOD on March 23rd and JPOW fired up the printer. I've been stuck holding SPY 190 5/1 and SPY 220 5/15 puts ever since because I'm retarded. Probably explains why I have 350K of med school debt. I've been a lurker for a long time but thought you guys would enjoy this. Stay safe my autist brothers, beer flu is no joke.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oqyd1nm8mnt41.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3149426d7f25cad0c23b950c1222a57a6cb46d35", "created_utc": 1587249496.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g3wki7/young_doctor_catches_terminal_diamond_hands/", "is_self": true}
