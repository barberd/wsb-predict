{"id": "cshho3", "title": "CVS puts", "selftext": "Buy CVS puts. \n\nCVS is usually my go to pharmacy. The other week i needed a steroid prescribed to fight some poison ivy. Very common steroid and they hadn\u2019t been able to get it from suppliers for months so had to get it somewhere else. Today my brother needed to get an epi pen and same thing.  \n\nSeems like they are having some legit supplier issues. Other pharmacies have been able to get the drugs so it\u2019s not just straight up shortages. I\u2019m guessing this has to be costing them a lot of business. \n\nIdk if they talked about this in their last earnings call, but I\u2019ll probably buy some puts for their next one if i listen to it and there is no mention. To be honest I probably won\u2019t have the motivation to listen to it and buy the puts anyways", "created_utc": 1566223342, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cshho3/cvs_puts/", "is_self": true}
