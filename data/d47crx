I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 16th, 2019.\n\n# **Week ahead: The stock market is poised to set a new record if the Federal Reserve delivers  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/13/week-ahead-the-stock-market-is-poised-to-set-a-new-record-if-the-federal-reserve-delivers.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by a quarter point on Wednesday, but what it says about its future plans will determine whether stocks continue their run at record highs.\n*****\n&gt; Tensions around this month\u2019s rates meeting decision are high. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell faces dissent from within the Fed board from some members who don\u2019t believe the economy is weak enough to warrant cutting rates. Two members opposed the last rate cut, and even more could oppose this one.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed is also under pressure from financial markets that threw a tantrum earlier this summer on concern the Fed was moving too slowly to stave off a recession. On top of that, the Fed faces an unprecedented level of criticism from the White House, with President Donald Trump repeatedly criticizing the Fed board and Powell, himself, for not cutting interest rates fast enough. This week, the president went so far as to call Fed officials \u201cboneheads\u201d and demanded they take the fed funds rate to zero or even a negative level.\n*****\n&gt; Against this backdrop, the stock market is flirting with new highs, as the Fed joins other central banks to ease policy, in the face of a global economic slowdown. Stocks were higher for the week and on Friday trading less than one percent below July\u2019s all-time highs in the Dow and S&amp;P 500. The Dow ended the week 1.6% higher at 27,219, while the S&amp;P 500 was up just about 1% at 3,007, 21 points away from its all-time high.\n*****\n&gt; The market was boosted by signs there could be progress in trade negotiations between the U.S. and China, as each side held off on some new tariffs, ahead of formal talks in October.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s been good news all around for the markets this week. You have thawing of trade tensions. You have more central bank easing, and you have Goldilocks economic data. Investors are thrilled...and that\u2019s why you have markets just fractionally below all-time highs,\u201d said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.\n*****\n&gt; Riding on the Fed\n&gt; The Fed stands to disappoint markets if it does not explicitly promise more easing. The Fed could do that in the quarterly projection of interest rate forecasts, which will be issued with its economic projections after the meeting. Fed officials include forecasts for growth and inflation, besides interest rates, which appear in a chart known as the \u201cdot plot.\u201d.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe question is will the Fed signal a willingness to keep going with rate cuts, or will they suggest this mid-cycle adjustment is nearing its end. My view is they\u2019re not going to back themselves into a corner, and they\u2019re going to give themselves plenty of room to cut again at some point,\u201d Arone said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be the biggest risk right now. The markets are pricing in a number of rate cuts in the next few quarters and will the Fed deliver on that...That will be a friction point.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; U.S. data in the past week has been largely better-than-expected, with August\u2019s retail sales up 0.4%, continuing a stronger trend, on the back of improved auto sales. The dilemma for the Fed, however, could be the fact that both producer and consumer level inflation picked up in August, with core CPI reaching 2.4%, its highest year over year growth pace since 2008. That is well above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, but the Fed prefers to watch PCE inflation, which is running at about 1.6%.\n*****\n&gt; On the calendar in the coming week is Empire State manufacturing Monday; industrial production Tuesday; housing starts Wednesday, and existing home sales and the Philadelphia Fed survey Thursday. But it\u2019s the Fed that will resonate more with markets.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe they think they\u2019ll cut 25 [basis points]. We think it will be a pretty even split between half the committee looking for one more cut and the rest looking for no action,\u201d said Kevin Cummins, senior economist at NatWest Markets. The Fed shaved the fed funds target rate range by a quarter point, to 2.00 to 2.25% in July.\n*****\n&gt; Some strategists haves said the more dissents, the more it would add to increased market volatility, since the Fed outlook becomes much more uncertain if Fed officials are not more uniformly supporting policy actions.\n*****\n&gt; Cummins said he expects the Fed\u2019s post-meeting statement to reflect slightly softer economic activity in July, and it will likely mentioning that the labor market may be just \u201csolid,\u201d instead of \u201cstrong\u201d and that job gains have moderated.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThat leaves the door open for more [rate cuts]. The dot plot shows another cut by the end of the year. You could make the case they\u2019ll pause in October if things remain the same,\u201d he said, adding they could also resume in December.\n*****\n&gt; Calmer markets\n&gt; The Fed faces much calmer markets than it would have in August, when trade tensions increased with Trump\u2019s tweet threatening more tariffs on China. Stocks have been rising as bond yields come off August lows, and traders are now pricing in a 25 basis point cut this week and one more for this year and another next year.\n*****\n&gt; As Treasury yields fell to record and multi-year lows in August, the futures market had priced as many as three more Fed rate cuts fort his year. Since then the 10-year yield, which moves opposite price, has rebounded to 1.90%\u2014 more than 45 basis points off its low.\n*****\n&gt; The more than 30 basis points move in the 10-year yield in the past week, was the largest weekly move since November, 2016.\n*****\n&gt; Trade developments could also move markets in the coming week, just as they have in the past week. Analyst say the market is most vulnerable if there\u2019s a negative surprise. Trump\u2019s tweet on trade Aug. 1, threatening more tariffs on China, created a new round of turbulence in markets.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s kind of ironic. Without the U.S. China trade conflict, the Fed wouldn\u2019t be cutting rates at all, and yet President Trump continues to bash them to cut rates,\u201d Arone said.\n*****\n&gt; Arone said the bigger overriding driver for the market is in fact the trade negotiations, and he said the markets may be too optimistic in expectations for a trade deal.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere\u2019s an inherent kind of risk to the markets if in fact, tensions escalate again,\u201d he said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/3j7NZ04.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/evh93Q8.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/vWJHuLZ.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/bsyz2mw.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uehftWf.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/gUpUJP6.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/8Go8qci.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/16Fa9BO.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/6AgPAyo.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/UBva2D9.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/0O6ZEgw.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/SypVbTN.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/qrtqxtW.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Long-Term Treasury ETF (TLT) Has 2nd Biggest Weekly Drop Ever\n\n&gt; Outside of equities, we saw a massive move higher in Treasury yields this week and a massive drop in Treasury bond prices. For the 20+ year Treasury ETF (TLT), this week's 6.34% drop was its second worst week on record since it began trading back in 2002.\n\n&gt; Below is a look at TLT's historical weekly percentage change, and we also show how TLT has performed in the weeks and months following one-week drops of more than 5% like we saw this week. As shown in the table, TLT has normally continued lower for a while following big down weeks.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/tltweek.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/tltdrops.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&amp;P 500 Nearing ATHs But Individual Sectors Not So Much\n\n&gt; The past week has been a solid run for the US equity market as a whole. The S&amp;P 500 continues to edge ever closer to prior all-time highs; opening today within half a percent of this level. As shown in the chart below, on average across all sectors, though, it is a little bit less optimistic. The average sector is still 6.5% below record highs. Excluding energy, which is by far the furthest (in terms of price and time) from its all-time high, the average across sectors jumps up to 3.6%. Consumer Staples and Utilities are the only sectors within 1% of their highs while the Tech sector is not far behind only 1.5% away.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/091319-ATH.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Betting Markets and the Election\n\n&gt; One way to keep track of the evolving Presidential primaries and general election news is the website electionbettingodds.com which shows what the betting market is predicting for upcoming election outcomes. In the charts below, we show the current probabilities of a primary and general election win for each of the various candidates (officially announced and otherwise) with a 1% or higher chance of winning. Elizabeth Warren now has a commanding lead in the Democrats' primary with a 34.9% chance of victory with Biden and Sanders in second and third.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/091319-Election1u.png))**\n\n&gt; Where things get more interesting is to figure out which candidates have the best chance of winning the general election assuming they win their primary. For example, President Trump's odds of winning his primary are 88.1%, but his odds of winning the general election for the Presidency are priced at 43.7%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/091319-Election2u.png))**\n\n&gt; By dividing that 43.7% by the 88.1% chance of primary victory we can get to a 49.6% general election pricing assuming the candidate wins their primary. This conditional probability probably shouldn't be taken too seriously, but it's got some interesting results. Among candidates polling over 5%, Beto O'Rourke has the highest odds (80%) of a general election win if he takes the primary while other Democratic hopefuls Andrew Yang and Bernie Sanders are priced at 60%+ odds. Biden's general election odds are at 55% if he wins the primary, while Warren -- the current front runner -- is at 49.9%. Notably, although Trump is close at 49.6%, no Republican has a conditional priced probability over 50% to win the general.\n\n&gt; All of that said, these conditional relationships can be very unstable and are complicated to arbitrage, so we probably shouldn't place too much faith in the detail of their message, but it's still interesting to see that markets are implicitly optimistic about the electability of a candidate like Sanders or Yang relative to more mainstream candidates like Warren, Harris, or Biden.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/091319-Election3u.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Copper Unconsolidated\n\n&gt; In last night's Closer, we noted the recent price action of copper. Over the past several months, copper had been consistently moving lower in a solid downtrend, but that downtrend has been broken this week. Finishing up about 1% in yesterday's session, copper had its first close above resistance which would suggest a further move higher. We're seeing additional gains today as the commodity continues to break out. Over the next few weeks, copper bulls will look for a series of higher highs and higher lows that would eventually form a new uptrend.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/091319-Copper2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# best and WORST S&amp;P 1500 Stocks Since 9/6\n\n&gt; This week has been all about little is big and big is little in terms of stock performance. Take the lists of best and worst performing S&amp;P 1500 stocks since last Friday's close. The first table below shows the 20 best performing S&amp;P 1500 stocks since the close last Friday. The fact that there are more than 20 stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 that are up over 20% already this week is notable in itself. Even crazier, though, is that when you look at the share prices of these stocks, all but seven have current share prices of less than $5 per share even after their gains this week, and the average share price of the 20 stocks listed is just $7.42. Also, as we noted in an earlier post, it's not as if there are tons of stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 trading below $5 per share. Heading into today, there were only 55 and 54 of them were up on the week.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/091219-Best-Stocks.png))**\n\n&gt; Turning to the list of losers so far this week, while there are more than 20 stocks that are up over 20%, not a single stock in the index is down 20% and only eight are down more than 10%. Besides the fact that the stocks listed below are down so far this week and the ones above are up, the other major and pretty consistent difference between the two lists is their share prices. As of today, the average price of the 20 biggest losers so far this week is $135.74 which is more than 18 times the average share price of the biggest week to date winners.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/091219-worst-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Throw It All Out the Window\n\n&gt; It's time to throw all those financial \"mumbo jumbo\" ratios out the window. That's right. You can take your P/E, P/B, P/S ratios and send them out packing with EV/EBITDA and the PEG ratio. While you're at it, why don't you free up some space and toss out all those finance textbooks you bought in college and grad school. None of it matters. At least not this week where making money in the market has been as simple as \"buy low and sell high.\"\n\n&gt; Through yesterday's close, the S&amp;P 1500, which is comprised of large-caps (S&amp;P 500), mid-caps (S&amp;P 400), and small-caps (S&amp;P 600), was up just under 1% on the week. The average week to date performance of individual stocks in the index, however, was a much more impressive gain of 5%. By far the biggest gains have come from the stocks with the lowest share prices. Coming into the week, there were 55 stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 that had share prices of less than $5, and through Wednesday's close, they were up an average of 21% with 54 of 55 in the black. 21%!!!! Coming into today, there were also seven stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 that were already up over 40% this week, and guess what? They all came into the week with share prices below $5.\n\n&gt; Looking at the performance of individual stocks this week shows that share prices appear to have been a key driver of performance. In the chart below, we grouped stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 based on their share prices as of last Friday and then calculated the average performance of the stocks in each group so far this week (through Wednesday's close). While stocks with share prices of less than $5 per share were up an average of 20.8%, the performance of stocks priced between $5 and $10 per share were up a still impressive 10.9%. What's even crazier about this chart is the fact that as you move out to the right (higher share prices), average performance consistently weakens to the point where stocks with high share prices ($100+) have only gained an average of 0.1% so far this week. Who needs Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMAZN) and Chipotle (CMG) when you could have had JC Penney (JCP), Dean Foods (DF), or Mallinckrodt (MNK). If these high priced stocks know what's good for them, they better start announcing 10-1 splits pronto! (That was a joke.)\n\n&gt; In all seriousness, the performance numbers listed below further illustrate this week's massive rotation out of momentum strategies, where stocks and sectors that had been leading have been sold off while those that had lagged or been written off for dead have seen some buying interest or at least an easing of selling pressure. All the textbooks and financial ratios in the world may provide comfort to analysts and investors, but they don't help at all when the momentum tide turns.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/091219-share-price.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Small Cap Surge\n\n&gt; Small caps have been serial underperformers versus the large-cap S&amp;P 500 over the last 12+ months, but they're having their day in the sun this week. Not only has the small-cap Russell 2,000 risen more than 1% for three consecutive trading days to start the week, but the index has also outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by more than one percentage point on each of the last three days.\n\n&gt; If this is the start of a longer-term small cap resurgence, there is certainly a lot of runway left. Below is a chart of the ratio between the S&amp;P 500 and the Russell 2,000 over the last 15 years. When the line is rising, the S&amp;P is outperforming the Russell. When the line is falling, the Russell is outperforming the S&amp;P.\n\n&gt; As you can see in the chart, the S&amp;P has been outperforming the Russell for the last year, and the ratio got extended to the very top of its 15-year range at the start of September. Since peaking earlier this month, however, the ratio has fallen dramatically as small caps have started to outperform. Even after the recent small-cap outperformance, the ratio remains well above its long-term average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/spyr2k.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Time For Gold To Shine?\n\n&gt; \u201cThe higher the base, the higher in space,\u201d is an old technical analysis saying.\n\n&gt; Gold is up 18% year-to-date (as of 9/10/2019), poised for its best year since 2010, when it gained 30%. We see many reasons why this rally may have legs.\n\n&gt; Last year\u2019s action was rare: The S&amp;P 500 Index, 10-year U.S. Treasuries, and gold were all lower. Going back to 1971, when gold was officially removed from the gold standard, last year was the first year that all three assets were lower in a calendar year. Now in 2019, all three assets are up significantly, quite a difference from last year!\n\n&gt; Gold and stocks have trended the same way: Since 1980, stocks and gold both have risen in 19 of those 39 years, and both have fallen in only four years. Somewhat surprisingly, both were up more than 10% in eight of those years. Gold might be viewed as \u201cdefensive,\u201d but history shows there can be times when both gold and stocks have had nice gains together.\n\n&gt; \u201cGold is breaking out to new highs after doing nothing for years,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cConcerns over the global slowdown, $17 trillion in negative yielding debt, inverted yield curves, and central banks stepping up their gold purchases have all pushed the yellow metal out of a picture-perfect base.\u201d\n\n&gt; Technicals support a rally: As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, gold completed a nice-looking six-year saucer bottom and broke out above previous resistance. As the quote at the start of the blog noted, when things base for years, the potential move can be quite explosive.\n\n&gt; A well-deserved pullback may present an opportunity for suitable investors to add exposure in appropriate strategies.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/y1eOv3G.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&amp;P 500 up 13 of last 16 September option expiration weeks\n\n&gt; September\u2019s option expiration week is up 62.2% of the time for S&amp;P 500 since 1982. DJIA and NASDAQ have slightly weaker track records with gains 56.8% of the time and 59.5% of the time respectively. However, the week has suffered several sizable losses.
