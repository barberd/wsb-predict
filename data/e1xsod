Disney's too big and has its fingers in too many pies.\n&gt; \n&gt; The real place to look is $HAS. About a 2 years ago, they fell due to the bankruptcy of Toys R Us, but held together a lot better than the failing Mattel, and were much better at shifting over to Target, Walmart and Amazon than others in the segment. Over this year, they surged from ~85 to ~120 off the back of Magic the Gathering's new digital \"Magic Arena\". Then, last quarter, they crashed back due to trade war bullshit, completely disregarding the continuing growth of Magic Arena and the upcoming release of Frozen 2.\n&gt; \n&gt; Frozen 1 was an absurdly huge success. Disney was caught flatfooted for that and brought Hasbro on as a partner for their toy lines pretty late to the party, but it still literally doubled Hasbro's \"girl toys\" sales for the year. This time, Hasbro and Disney have been partnered from the beginning and have already gotten every store to push Frozen 2 toys since the beginning of the month. If Frozen 2 delivers even a reasonable fraction of Frozen 1's success, Hasbro's gonna pop off.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is like... anti-priced in.\n\nThose claims are relatively easy to check from the various quarterly conference calls over the last 5 years or so, or you can trust a stranger on the internet.\n\nAnyway, $HAS was up 2% yesterday and is already up another 1% premarket today, [Baby Yoda toys confirmed](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/21/business/baby-yoda-toys/index.html), and as I said earlier MTG Arena and Frozen 2 have been in their sights for a good long time now.
