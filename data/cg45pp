They attribute most of this to their total depletion\u2019s increase to 11% while total shipments offsetting this with a 31% increase from Q1 of 2018. They believe distributors hit a sweet spot with a stocking level of 6 weeks on hand from the demand of Truly. They believe that the distributors on hand will fall to the 3-4 weeks range in coming months. \n\nThis is where I\u2019m calling a surprise beat. I think Truly and their competitor White Claw both have been a big hit in the first part of the summer. SAM expecting shipments to decrease where I think we could see a surprising amount of sales for Q2.", "created_utc": 1563743513, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cg45pp/sam_boston_brewing_co_reports_q2_earnings_on_july/", "is_self": true}
