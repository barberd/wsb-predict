We would either have to lock down and cause significant damage to the economy, or else face hospital overloads and hundreds of thousands of deaths. I predicted that this would cause a huge drop in already-inflated equities when profits shrink up and companies stop buying back their own shares. I also predicted that there would be loan defaults across the board, from personal loans and mortgages to corporate debt. I thought the impact would be long lasting and any optimism in the stock market would be temporary and a good shorting opportunity. \n\nIt\u2019s really difficult to let go of losing positions when you still believe the underlying thesis. But it\u2019s time to re-evaluate the underlying assumptions. \n\nStock prices primarily come down to what big market participants are willing to pay and what other big market want to sell for. Where these balance is where we see stock prices. My bear thesis included a prediction that money would flow into safer havens in a recession and that stocks would dramatically fall in price. But two things have changed:\n\n1) The Fed has shown a very real and honest picture of how it views its role in this crisis. It has priorities: to maintain the economy, and by that I mean big business, NO MATTER what it costs. They literally have said this and backed it up with policy decisions. Yes, there are problems here. Cracks in the system. Potential failures. But the Fed will not let it fall. THIS has made big money participants comfortable with the idea that their money in equities is safe. Rather than fly to other investments, the dip has been bought. Maintaining big business means keeping the stock market as an institutionally supported place to park massive amounts of funds. As long as this comfort remains, stocks will not fall. Which brings me to point 2. \n\n2) We have successfully contained the coronavirus. Yes, we have a ways to go before we open up. Yes, there is a chance for a recurrence. But look around the world. The \u201crecurrences\u201d that have occurred post-lockdown (for example, in Singapore) have been VERY small. Like 50 cases here. 100 cases there (in China). Nothing to worry about. Literally \u201cit\u2019s just like the flu.\u201d Yes, that was a retarded thing to say in February and March. But in a post-spread world, it is no longer retarded. \n\nPortions of the economy will open up piece by piece, and the most affected businesses will either 1) fail, if they are too small and Congress doesn\u2019t do enough or 2) be supported by the government. The companies that fall into category 1 are NOT the companies listed in the S and P 500. \n\nYes, we may see continued cases all year and it will hang over every single round of earnings until it\u2019s gone. We will see dropped profits, missed guidance, reduced and/or no guidance, slow downs, and everything that you want to see as a bear. BUT THE MARKET WILL NOT GIVE A SHIT. \n\nAnd that is why we need to pack up our bags and admit that we simply called it wrong this time around.", "created_utc": 1586890921.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1bla6/fellow_bears_we_were_actually_wrong/", "is_self": true}
