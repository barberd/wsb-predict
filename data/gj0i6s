However, fucking oil has killed my ass and I'm down 9k w\\\\ multiple oil retarded plays.  Lots of tankers in there. Went the wrong way on bynd, wrong way on NYT, bet against Elon a few times like a fucking nitwit, strike too high on match.\n\n\\~3k remaining in oil options that I withdrew and put it all on Cisco. Why?\n\nWebex. Is this desperation? 100%. Am I a degenerate? Absolutely. Why? Bad parenting.\n\nI've worked at many large corporations & Webex is always option #1 for a teleconference. I know MSFT and zoom ate into ciscos dominance here, idc. I have no idea how the hardware division is doing. Nor did I bother to research how much $$$ they make in different divisions. At this point, it doesn't matter. \n\nI'm dumb. Fuck it. Let me lose and be done with this bullshit.\n\n5/22 45c\n\n6/19 50c\n\nOther positions \\~5k total. BABA, JD, FTCH, a few freeroll SDC's left, but I already took seed + profit from those calls. \n\nWill post updates in the future so you can enjoy loss porn.", "created_utc": 1589381472.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gj0i6s/time_to_embrace_my_fate_with_csco/", "is_self": true}
