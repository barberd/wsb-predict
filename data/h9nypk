{"id": "h9nypk", "title": "$SNE, $EA, $ATVI DD", "selftext": "$SNE recently announced the PlayStation 5, and a handful of titles to be released alongside it. It has been on a rise for the last three months since March lows, and was peaking at this price before the drop. The PS4 is the best selling console this generation, with over 100 million sold. Still 50 million behind their PS2 back in the day. Their sales have probably boosted during the pandemic because now the virgins who lost their money have to go back to their video games. Tech stocks have been going up continuously throughout the pandemic, and I\u2019m surprised these didn\u2019t get boosted after reveal last week. Even Cramer thinks this one is undervalued. \n\n$EA is hosting their EA Play press conference this Thursday, and is going to be revealing the new Madden game tomorrow. $EA has been making a comeback as a developer with some consistently better releases, expansion of their online services like EA Access, and recently announced a new Star Wars game, alongside their new FIFA and NHL (which will be announced Thursday) for Holiday 2020. They have $5.74 billion in cash and only over 1 billion in debt, and have passed their old 52 week high. Also in talks to buy ATT\u2019s gaming division. \nEvent Article: https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-play-live-2020-when-and-how-to-watch-the-digita/1100-6476783/\n\n$ATVI has Call of Duty and World of Warcraft, and their most recent entry, Modern Warfare, has been their best selling Call of Duty. They\u2019re going to announce the next Call of Duty very soon, as it\u2019s typically done in May but was delayed, and just released the newest season of MW. They have total cash of 5.98 billion and a debt of 2.68 billion, so they\u2019re not under any financial stress. Also in talks to buy ATT\u2019s gaming division. \n\n$TTWO is also a good one but the most expensive one. They\u2019ve got Rockstar Games, which makes Grand Theft Auto , and they\u2019re porting GTA 5 to PS5 and next gen. This thing is a cash cow for them and they have $2 billion in cash and 190 million in debt. CEO was on Mad Money recently and expects industry to flourish and continue to grow. Also in talks to buy ATT\u2019s gaming division. \n\nHere is the ATT deal:\n\nhttps://deadline.com/2020/06/warner-bros-interactive-shopped-titles-include-harry-potter-and-game-of-thrones-report-1202958605/\n\nPositions:\nEA 145c 7/2\nATVI 78c 6/26\nSNE 75c 6/19\n\nTLDR: Buy SNE, EA, ATVI, TTWO, or video game calls. Stocks only go up.", "created_utc": 1592252174.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h9nypk/sne_ea_atvi_dd/", "is_self": true}
