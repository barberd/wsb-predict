{"id": "b7w7c8", "title": "I pick options so you don't have to [Week beginning April 1, 2019]", "selftext": "**Disclaimer:** **You don't have to believe, agree with, or go with any of these picks.** These are the picks I'm watching this week and plan on potentially making plays into depending on if my dick is hard in the morning. Trade at your own risk. *When I use the term YOLO play,* ***it doesn't necessarily mean FD's,*** because some tickers are light on option chains. It just means put it in, and hold until you're +500% or more, or take the market in the ass in the short term. Out of the trades listed, the YOLOs *probably* have the most upside percentage gain potential, these are for the gamblers.\n\n# Some Thoughts For This Week\n\nLast week received pretty positive feedback, some people messaged me thanking me for finding them places to YOLO their money and others had various questions. Many people asked things like, \"What do I do now? I'm up XXX%\" or \"Am I still holding,\" etc. I figured I'd write out a quick message that is basically: Once you choose a play to make, you should already have an exit plan or whatever. It isn't my choice to tell you how much risk to take or how much profit you're aiming to make. Look at your positions, portfolio and either cash in tendies or YOLO it out, once you make a play it's all you. I can' t make you better at trading, but I can help give you some starting points on thought processes. I won't be responding to as many PM's this week in regards to questions like this because you should already have a plan for each trade regardless which way it goes.\n\n# How The Picks Are Generated\n\nThese stocks are found using my own scanner criteria across a variety of metrics depending on market conditions. Picks are generated from that scan. A few of the criteria:\n\n* Market cap of $5B+\n* Daily volume of 1M+\n* $10 mark and higher\n* Max PE of 25\n* Volume, volume differential, RSI, 52 week low's and high's, ToS sizzle, and a few others decide what comes out of the scan, then selected as a pick based on current market conditions/sentiment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Results On Last Week's Picks\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Lennar (LEN) - BULLISH*** \\- I think this play was listed first and played out how I thought. They ended up giving some back after earnings. It peaked $6 intraweek, and had some spots where there were a lot of places to make money. Hopefully you saw the reversal on Wednesday and got out Thursday beginning of day, or Wednesday at some point and scaled out -- once the yield curve stabilized the market didn't really care as much about the home builders even though numbers were up, production was down on KB Home, so it's a mixed bag. It's only a dollar above where it started last week. This is a perfect example of learning to trade and finding profitable spots to enter, and exit, like I talked about above.\n\n**Apple (AAPL) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Opened the week at 190, closed the week at 190. If you BTFD at the 184 mark on Tuesday, you made money, otherwise, hopefully, again, you had exit points to get out of this shit because Tim Cook really bent us over on that event. Good announcements, underwhelming, people sold the news. Too bad.\n\n**Royal Bank of Canada (RY) -** ***BEARISH*** \\- Closed the week a few cents below where it opened but a mid week rally didn't help. I'm still bearish on this, so you can review last week's picks if you want. I wouldn't really be looking to trade it anymore as it's not reacting the same as other financials right now, but June Puts are still probably in the range of possible trades here.\n\n**Twitter (TWTR) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Made an early week rally, and mid week rally off the lows. Looks like the whole market was making odd movements mid week, but I'm still bullish on this. It's back again this week, though.\n\n**Boeing (BA) -** ***BULLISH/BEARISH*** \\- I said I wasn't bearish past last week, and I got this one right. Opened week at 360, closed at 381.23. I only see it continuing up so if you have the 5/17 spreads from last week - you're probably doing alright about now. The 4/12 $377.50 calls at $5.24 are now $10.55 and even have room to run for a couple days before the theta really starts to eat them up the next few days, so that's a one week 100% winner if anybody went with it. I know those are too expensive for many here, but it's a good example why paying premium is worth it sometimes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll in all, I'd say last week I like the picks in general, still do, and we'll see what develops. But onto this week's stuff.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Picks for Week of April 1st, 2019\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Twitter (TWTR) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- I'm still bullish on Twitter. Stock's sitting at the support/resistance level again, if it climbs out of this area above 33 and change, I think it really has room to run. They report 4/23/19, I expect a beat. We'll see what happens though. That being said, holding anything up to earnings, you should see a bit of consolidation, it's heavily traded at the end of each day and has a very similar curve day to day, so I think it's being accumulated still. Consolidation is always good for price increasing.\n\n* **Short term: 4/18 $34 calls @ $0.62**\n   * Look to exit these before expiration unless they spike into the money by at least a dollar. Looking to hit early week momentum if the market really pops tomorrow like I think it may.\n* **Long term: 6/21 $41 calls @ $0.71**\n   * Same pick as last week, they're 5 cents per share cheaper. You get more time here to decide what to do. If you get the run you want, cash out the investment, freeride the rest, or let them all ride. Once again, your entries and exits aren't my choice. Early May exit still at least on a portion of the position.\n* **Debit spread: 4/12 calls, Buy $33.5 @ $0.63, Sell $35.50 @ $0.17, $0.46 per spread.**\n   * If you get a decent run by a dollar or two this week, you can easily double, or triple your money here. Cheap spread to get into, less exposure and easy and liquid to get out of if it starts to drop this week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gamestop (GME) -** ***BEARISH*** \\- My outlook on this company is long term bearish. Now, they may surprise us with earnings this week but in the scheme of things, it really doesn't mean anything. Best Buy, Target, etc. are taking market share from these guys, and more importantly -- what we're seeing with them is a repeat of what happened to Hollywood Video/Blockbuster when they went up against Netflix. The web is the way. Game delivery aggregators like Steam and Origin are hand over fist exploding compared to Gamestop, and they keep closing stores like mad. Even if they go up, buy options with time to rebound down because if they don't go to 0, someone will acquire the assets, inventory and brand. To me, they're an acquisition target if only for their premium membership list and targeting potential for a bigger company. I don't think they can stop the landslide that is their company. When they report, this thing piles into the ground regardless of hit or miss on EPS it seems, because their guidance is continually shit. Unless something's happened with the new management, I don't expect much from them this week.\n\n* **Short term: 4/12 $10 puts @ $0.42**\n   * Spray and pray. Seems like even if they beat, you could be cashing in on these hard. I feel like looking at the long term trend of this, it's just a long drill into the core of the earth.\n* **Longer term: 5/17 $10 puts @ $0.63 or $9 puts @ $0.29**\n   * For like $21 a contract, or for $13 less a contract, you buy yourself another month out in expiration, and it seems even when this stock goes up, people profit take and it comes right back down.\n* **YOLO: 4/5 $9 puts @ $0.14**\n   * Obviously, these are a basic earnings FD. I mean, you know what to do. Hope the play is right and cash out when you sweat too much to stay in anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Aurora Cannabis (ACB) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- I'm bearish on almost every cannabis stock purely because of their ridiculous valuations. From the research I've done, although Aurora is also ridiculously valued, I take their market position, provincial position and more vs it's competitors. I think it's a bargain, and could easily trade at $20 in the next year. The fact is: One of these companies is going to really start pulling away, and with the upside left in this one, I'd rather go with a company that's more speculative than one that's trading between a $60 an $200 range in the last year. They report May 7th, so -- imo you can expect a run up until then. While earnings could be VERY risky, if you're not the risk averse type, you may be in store for a payout. If you are, just cash out and take the IV run up, but get into them now.\n\n* **IV Play - 5/17 $10 calls @ $0.60 or 6/21 $10 calls @ $0.85**\n   * Seems like easy money, honestly. I don't imagine them randomly dropping to $7/share and as IV increases, you can easily just sell off the Vega premium on these when earnings approaches. If you buy enough, and if they even flinch in the right direction before, you can freeroll a pretty big chance at big gains.\n* **Long term - 9/30 debit spread $10-$13 call debit spread, Buy $10 call @ $1.28, Sell $13 @ $0.63**\n   * At like $0.65 per spread, there's $3 in premium theoretical per spread, and September is plenty of time to see the move you need to capture it. This one I would consider a large position play, you need to throw a decent chunk at it in order to be invested enough and not feel like it's just sitting there staring back at you doing nothing. However, if it moves the wrong way, you should easily be able to recognize and set a stop loss and get out since earnings is the only catalyst event (probably two reports) between now and expiration.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bank of America (BAC) -** ***BULLISH -*** I know, I know, I said last week financials are taking the big D. However, Tim Sloan's on his way out, and people like image change. Whether or not he was responsible for their shit is besides the point. Their image has changed. They trended up last week, money flow spiked up about 50% to $319M from below $200, and it looks like this could be a chance to rally and take advantage of people acquiring this stock.\n\n* **Short term - 4/26 $28 calls @ $0.54**\n   * These seem to be a bit cheaper than I would anticipate. I think if the market rallys, financials will gain back what they drilled off on the curve inversion selloff. Good chance to get easy gains. Get out of them before end of week if they aren't printing.\n* **Long term - 6/21 $29 calls @ $0.62**\n   * Pretty good price with 60 more days of theta burn for about $8 more per contract. Same thing. Make sure it's going your way, if not, burn them off. This stock will fluctuate up and down so if you're up, set yourself a decent draw down before you cash and run because it will consolidate more (up and down) before it really goes up, if it's going to.\n* **YOLO - 4/5 $28.50 calls @ $0.04/$0.05 or $28 calls @ $0.14**\n   * Personally, I don't know how much I'd throw at this one, but you can snatch a lotto ticket here possibly. Depending what happens premarket (hoping that it opens flat to last week's close) these could be a fucking bargain. For $100 you can snatch up maybe 15-20 of them depending, and they're only $0.90 share price from being ATM? Even at $0.15/$0.25 on the $28's, I'm a buyer here. You can watch it for a day and if it trends for Monday/Tuesday, it's easy 100%-200% gains, and you can probably cash out and freeroll.\n\n# Stocks That Could Be Worth A Look\n\n**Bullish:** Apple (AAPL), Adobe (ADBE), Autodesk (ADSK), Ally Financial (ALLY), Amazon (AMZN, Alibaba (BABA), Altaba (AABA), Boeing (BA), Annheuser-Busch (BUD), CBS (CBS), Celgene (CELG), Dell (DELL), Dowdupont (DWDP), Teva Pharm (TEVA), Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS), MGM Resorts (MGM), Credit Suisse (CS), Principal Financial (PFG)\n\n**Bearish:** Tiffany (TIF), Accenture (ACN), Equifax (EFX), Booz Allen (BAH), Paychex (PAYX), Johnson Controls Intl (JCI), Discover Inc (DISCK), GoDaddy (GDDY), Array Biopharm (ARRY), People's United Financial (PBCT), Tencent Music (TME), Monster Beverage (MNST)\n\n# State of the Market\n\nEverybody's worried about a big pullback. I'm not, at the current moment. A recession will come with time, but I don't think it's this week and I think last week's action was purely profit taking by institutions and algorithms. They've found exits and gotten back out of positions many were stuck in for months, remember: Some people buy shares and not options. We saw mid day consolidation on a rise, and more profit taking at the end of the day. Timing it isn't possible, so don't try to. As far as the numbers are concerned, this is still a bull market, and although I like Gundlach, he feels so perma bear that I don't know we can take his words for face value. I think he's seriously short -- and bleeding trying to pull a Dr. Burry. We gained too far too fast on Thursday after fed announcements, and people saw a chance to cash out.\n\n# Best Way To Play These Picks\n\nAt any given time if you have more than 3-4 tickers open for options and you're not a professional trader, you're probably not making correlated picks. An example is playing Apple/Facebook/Microsoft and SPY. If any of those gain, it's more likely SPY gains that week since it's weighted towards them, and the S&amp;P is weighted towards them. Calls in both double dips, but can see your money evaporate also. Buying tech sector puts and SPY calls makes no sense, for the exact same rationale unless it's a pure hedge against share value, or an isolated catalyst like a lawsuit or acquisition, in which case, it's probably going to pull the ETF/index down or up with it anyway. Play a few of these positions, or just one, and find complimentary positions. Example: Verizon on top of Apple is good - if their streaming service is good and requires iPhone hardware, you'll see a boost in iPhone sales from Verizon and ATT, etc. Corresponding markets are a good way to double dip on plays.\n\n# Want Me To Cover A Ticker?\n\nIf you've got something you are eyeing, I'll occasionally be willing to do a quick analysis of it, if the underlying looks worth it. If it's not, I won't. If it is, I'll add a section below here that's WSB Picks and pick a few plays on it based on the same criteria the above. **If you ask for a ticker play, include the ticker symbol with a $, like $TSLA,** so I can just search the thread for them. I probably won't do picks on all request, but I'll try to reply to thoughts on many. The threads will get longer week by week, and so try to understand if I can't get to all of it. Below is a list of stocks I won't cover, and it will grow week by week.\n\n**Stocks I won't cover or comment on (because they're just too ridiculous):** Tesla, Micron\n\n# WSB Requests\n\nI don't follow these stocks nearly as much, if any, and this DD is even more surface level than the above. Just my thoughts on the requests.\n\n\\-- None Yet --\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHave fun, good luck, get tendies.", "created_utc": 1554085954, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b7w7c8/i_pick_options_so_you_dont_have_to_week_beginning/", "is_self": true}
