You\u2019re checking SPY, masturbating, and watching WSB posts from a distance.\n\nLet me put some value inside you. You have two options. Either sell 301/302 Credit Call Spreads EXP 3/11 right at open and sell at 50 percent for 1:1 free tendies. Or, sell the 33.5/34.5 3/13 Credit Call Spreads on EWZ. Brazil hasn\u2019t been hit too hard yet but this shit will crash and you\u2019ll get 2:1 on your money. \n\nI\u2019ve done this a few times the past two weeks and it cannot go tits up. You will find a bigly profitable exit. There\u2019s only two things that matter in this world: speed and girth.\n\nAll call credit spreads will make it rain in the next couple weeks just be sure to exit when you\u2019re up 50 percent or so. For you autists with smaller accounts this is an easy way to double up quickly over and over again.\n\nI just gave two examples but there\u2019s a lot more plays that make sense.\n\nThere\u2019s a million ways to fuck this goat, I\u2019m just holding the legs.", "created_utc": 1583497406, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fecq47/how_to_play_today_for_free_tendies/", "is_self": true}
