And you just have to sign up for my half day seminar coming to your town at a near time when coronavirus has a vaccine like AIDS does.\n\nIn all seriousness. Some people on this thread were mentioning the best kept secret of WSB of all time.... Covered calls!\n\nThese things are legit and safe. You can do this with several stocks...\n\nI'm testing with CCL, MGM and Donkey Kong stock to start. You have to buy 100 shares of real stock. (Yes, buy real stock in the company..... Then instead of buying the call... You sell a call at a time near in the future and somehow your account magically collects the premium that some sucker paid on call options.\n\nSo the trick kids is don't blow your money at the casino by betting big on red. It's always best to be the casino. \n\nPositions:\nI am the casino for MGM, Donkey Kong, and CCL calls for the earliest expiration possible.", "created_utc": 1592551665.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hbwbaw/covered_calls_vs_calls/", "is_self": true}
