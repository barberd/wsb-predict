But hear me out. The mouse will not be going out of business, he\u2019s sitting on cash and he\u2019s got feds backing him for sure. Point is, Disney parks are closed, there\u2019s a major shift in management a lucasfilms, the MCU is over, and Morbius will 100% flop because of no Jared Leto joker tattoos.

Basically, when people get bored of Disney+, FOX will be it\u2019s only income and will go down, as pretty much all films have been delayed and theaters are shut down. This means that we need to watch and see when it\u2019ll hit its low, my guess-early November 2020, right before shit picks up again. It\u2019s too early to say of course, but needless to say, if Disney\u2019s attempts at gaining profit are unsuccessful, we got opportunity.
