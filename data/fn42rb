{"id": "fn42rb", "title": "Tips on reducing your tax liability", "selftext": "Disclaimer: Everything in this post refers to the tax policies in the USA and does not touch on state taxes. Do not YOLO your tax return. Go talk to someone other than a guy on Reddit. That is not a viable excuse if you get audited. The majority of these numbers are for single individuals and double when you file married. \n\nFor other info besides reducing liability, see my [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkj41g/you_dumb_fucks_dont_know_about_taxes_read_this/) from the other day.\n\nIf you made more than 500k this year, stop reading now and just go to an accounting firm. They will save you more than they charge you. You would be surprised at the amount of people who ask a guy from Reddit how to treat their 800k gains.\n\nYou may be subject to a [penalty](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc306) if you owe more than $1,000 at the end of the year. This can be avoided by making estimated payments if you made significant gains. Anything over paid will be refunded when you file your return. This is the same as when your employer withholds taxes from your paycheck and reports on your W-2, assuming you have ever had a job.\n\n\\-Donate to charity. The IRS [increased](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p526) their deduction limit from 50% to 60% of your income. This means that donations over 60% of your income do not qualify to reduce your taxable income. You also have to get over the standard deduction and start itemizing. For a single person, your itemized deductions must be over $12,200 to start counting. See below for what can get itemized.\n\n\\-Itemized deductions instead of standard deduction. The IRS cut out a lot of itemized deductions and raised the standard deduction over the past few years. It pretty much applies only to personal property taxes (car tags, etc.), real estate taxes, mortgage interest, medical expenses, and donations to charity. Each of these have their own [limits](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1040sca.pdf). If your accountant says tax prep fees are deductible, they are lying. Some states still do it on a local level, but they cut that shit out in 2018 for the federal returns.\n\n\\-Start a business or farm. Be careful though, there are [limitations](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-highlights-tax-reform-changes-that-affect-businesses) on the amount of losses you can take. For a single person, you can take up to a $250,000 loss against your income for the year. This loss has nothing to do with your losses on capital transactions (options, stocks, etc.). The rest is rolled over to the next year for when or if you ever make gains again.\n\n\\-Starting a rental property or other passive activities have a different set of [rules](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p925.pdf) which have increased loss limitations. A passive activity has many criteria, but the biggest rule is participating less than 500 hours a year in the activity. In general, passive losses only apply to passive activity. You will always be able to take these losses, it just may not be in the same year they were incurred.\n\n\\-Start a retirement fund. Contributions to your 401k and tradition IRA's are tax deductible up to a certain amount. The current amounts for 2020 are [$19,500](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/401k-contribution-limit-increases-to-19500-for-2020-catch-up-limit-rises-to-6500) for 401k and [$6,000](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-ira-contribution-limits) for an IRA. These amounts change if you're over 50. These limitations also change if you are self employed.\n\n\\-Start a FSA (flexible spending account) or a HSA ( health savings account). The contribution limit for 2019 was [$2,700](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf). These get out there as far as limitations and who qualifies. No one here is paying me to explain it, so I'm not going to. Go talk to someone.\n\n\\-Casualty, disaster, and theft losses. This is still to be determined how the current national emergency will impact this [publication](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc515). Before now, you had to be in a federally declared disaster zone to claim anything. The IRS has not made any announcement how this will be treated this year.\n\nTLDR:  CSV $20 Call 04/17", "created_utc": 1584900542.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fn42rb/tips_on_reducing_your_tax_liability/", "is_self": true}
