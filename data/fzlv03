I am using my \"other\" Reddit account to keep Pelosi off my ass, but its not like she can do shit anyway given the Fed's \"independence\" (wink wink to my boi Trump).\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to let you retards know a few things before the rest of the world catches on to this shit I have been working on.\n\nWe all need to make our moves asap - *especially before the lower and middle class humans* get a chance to grasp what is happening. We need those guys to keep working their W2s and 1099s for this to shake out as planned. We really can't have the media or Bernie Sanders type guys figuring this out.\n\nThose plebes need to stay on the hamster wheel paying their taxes and mortgages and such. They don't even realize we tax them on their unemployment benefits lol.\n\nEventually the economists and middle class will catch on, and there might be some significant social unrest, but that will take a while to unfold so for now, **we need to keep this shit going and we need to act now**.\n\nLet's get these tendies while we can, and then we will throw our hands up later and blame the Politicians, Chinese, Democrats and the system itself. Amirite?\n\nI know most of you retards can only think one week in advance, and most can't even read, but if you can grasp a few of these concepts you can do a lot better on those weeklies as well. And if you are a high level autist, you may be able to string together a few wins in a row over the long term and finally move out of your mom's boyfriend's basement.\n\nHere are a few key points you need to understand if you want to be printing like me over the next 5 years:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **No more capitalism,** I single handedly killed it and I am not sure how that will play out for everyone, but it is going to be great for rich people. Pretty cool right? Before, if you took on too much risk, or debt, you might face consequences like high interest rates or even bankruptcy. I basically just took away that downside for everyone. Go ahead and dial up the risk. Being responsible is just another way of saying \"slow growth.\"\n* **No Bankruptcies:** No company, state, city is going to go under. I got this, just send me the bill and I will make the future pay for it. Problem solved. I might let some shit businesses fail so that no once catches on, but the real shit, and the meme shit will be protected indefinitely. We can't have boomers lose their 401ks and bankers/hedge fund guys are need shit to go up to get paid so were going up. We used to go down sometimes historically, but now... stonks only go up.\n* **Employees and 1099** guys will be fine because I am just forcing the future American tax payer to pay them now. They don't really have to produce or work, we will just make our future selves, the working class specifically (don't worry, this only applies to average people who work themselves to death and die without any assets), work twice as hard or just pay twice as much in taxes. Either way, its their problem now. The future poor guy is paying today's poor guy wages - this is pretty creative honestly and I thank Trump and Congress for their support in this regard.\n* **Debt is free** and defaulting isn't a thing. Have a mortgage? Call them up. They will give you 6 months forbearance - just say the magic words \"COVID-19\" and watch your debt obligations diminish. We will do a refi for you as well - rates are historically low! Call your credit cards and auto leases too and start crying. I know you guys are leveraged to the tits, so just push back on your creditors, they will push back on their banks, those banks push back on me, and I will buy that shit no problem. Not a big deal. And... you are welcome, but thank me later.\n* **Nationalism** is here to stay. I am solving all this financial shit for everyone, but the printers wouldn't be working this hard if China wasn't eating live Pangolins that bats shit on. I mean honestly, you think we are going to be into working intimately with China? All our medical stuff, and some other critical supplies are coming from other countries - you better believe Trump is going to blame them for all our health issues and we will bring all that manufacturing back home. Expect to see US companies grow faster than international and focus your investments on Making America Great Again. Don't you get it?\n* **Oil** aint shit now and if these OPEC countries want to fuck around, I am going to print bigly and Trump is going to buy while it is low. If they fuck around too much and we will just stop buying altogether and go fully independent - which we totally can do. OK if some of those oil rig companies are going to go under, I will buy up their debt and pay their employees. Maybe Trump starts building roads and walls and those guys can do that stuff? We will figure it out, but as you can tell, none of this shit really is a big deal. I will squash it with a few trillion.\n* **The global banking system** is quasi run by the US Fed and I can pretty much do what I want, when I want - and all the other banks globally are forced to play along. Those guys are going negative, we have the best currency and we control this shit. Some might say, I am the most powerful person in history... very cool Kanye!\n* **Inflation is coming**, but there is a simple way to avoid it: buy financial assets. Haven't you guys seen this story before? This is how we make the income gap even bigger - which side do you want to be on? You don't want cash, you don't want savings, you want risky assets - and this is how we win OK? The working class will be on the sidelines, getting inflated to shit, paying higher taxes and their future selves and tax dollars are making us rich today. This is the opportunity. We are taking their future money - its that simple honestly.\n* **Start a company** if you don't have one already. In case you retards haven't noticed, have you seen where the vast majority of this money is going? To companies first who then decide to pay their laborers (or not?). If we wanted to help the people, we would put the money in their hands, but we don't really care. For those not aware, any shitty LLC, S-corp, consulting business, cup cake stand can submit an application for a no questions asked 10k advance and free money via PPP. Oh, you don't have a EIN, and don't have a corporation? Go get in line for unemployment loser. See the difference? Make an LLC and mow your mom's yard once a month, we will grease you bigly and then get that money into financial assets ASAP.\n* **Social unrest** is probably coming after this honestly. We fucked everyone majorly in 2008 and got away it it for the most part, and this is like 10x 2008 so people eventually are going to get really pissed. Matt Damon will probably make a movie about it... but... it will be too late! Everyone will already be super poor and the rich will be super rich! But beware... the pitchforks are coming and you need to have that on your long term horizon.\n* **Trump** is 100% getting re-elected. Biden is a d-d-d-d-d-dd-d-douche and Trump will shit on him on live TV soon enough. Plus, we are pumping the market bigly and the boomers aint dead yet so expect Trump 2.0 in November. You all know what he is willing to and will do to keep this stock shit pumping for his friends, amirite?\n* **Trump's second term** is going to be like letting the kid lose in the candy store. Imagine what this man will do with free debt and no need to worry about reelection? He will go HAM greasing rich dudes and you need to catch that wave the best you can. I am trying to help you here guys...\n* **2024 After Trump:** This is when we are going to likely have to pay this shit off unfortunately. Some Bernie type person, maybe AOC, is going to show up with an army of super poor pitch fork holding proletariate and they likely will be violent at this point. They will at minimum be so poor and pissed that they actually show up to vote for left leaning candidates and all our hard work will start to be undone. These lefties are going to tax the shit out of us and probably force us into more social programs/heath care. It is going to suck, but its coming - and neither Trump nor I will be around to protect you. Puts won't save you either. Who knows.\n* **Be Irrational**: Stop using your big brains to analyze where the market should be going based on data. Instead, take a step back and consider where the market will be going cause printer go brrrrrrr. Your assumptions are not valid if the rules to the game have changed guys, and who makes the rules here? I do.\n\nSo what do I recommend?\n\nEach person's situation is different, but the recipe is the same: **borrow for free, and go long on financial assets.**\n\nDon't short the domestic market, I will indirectly destroy you and not feel bad in the slightest.\n\nStart a company, having an EIN is much better than just having a Social Security number. The US is all about corporations, not people - don't get that confused.\n\nTLDR: capitalism fake now, money fake, debt free, fake rallies are real rallies. Risky assets going up, no consequences, future poor people will pay for it, lets get rich now. Plan should work next 5 years, but pivot in year 4 before the revolution comes. Prob can't help you then.\n\nIf you guys have any questions, I am happy to answer in the comments below.  AMA!\n\nPS.
