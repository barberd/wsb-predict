You have 3 years to repay this money tax free (all taxes and penalties for early withdrawal are waved if repaid in 3 years) as this will function like a tax free rollover. \n\n\\-If you take money from your employers retirement account per the CARES act distributions, you don't have to repay that account with your employer, you can put it in another IRA with any other broker or several brokers.  Here's how thats useful for those with shitty retirement options at work or limited options.  Usually most employers WON'T let you rollover your retirement funds until are you aren't working for the company/entity anymore.\n\n**Example**:  Your company offers crappy mutual fund choices (only 10 of them and they all have stupid fees) in your retirement plan.  You take money out for Virus impact (100k) for whatever reason you need the money to.        \n\nWhenever the time comes and you want to repay the money, you can put into whatever broker IRA you want to do (example). You could repay the 100k into 1 broker or split between a couple different IRA's.  Example:\n\n50k into tastyworks to buy LEAP AAPL options that you previously couldn't do in your retirement fund.\n\n50k into vanguard to buy shares/etfs/funds in things that you like because your employer plan only limited you to those \"X\" funds.   \n\nTL:DR Buy puts on high fee fund companies because their assets will start shrinking once people realize they can rollover a portion of their retirement assets tax free to better brokers with low fee's/better choices.", "created_utc": 1586720804.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g03da0/psa_on_up_to_100k_worth_of_401k_coronavirus/", "is_self": true}
