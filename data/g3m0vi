{"id": "g3m0vi", "title": "Ventilate Gate", "selftext": "Ungrateful CA governor complained that papa Musk didn\u2019t make good on the 1,000 ventilator deliveries he promised.  Asshole CNN couldn\u2019t just let it go, so they contacted hospitals directly and found that the 1,000 ventilators he acquired from China were not actually ventilators, but instead CPAP and biPAP machines.\n\n\u201cCPAP machines typically start around $500, while biPAP machines can be had for about $1,200. Ventilators, however, range in price from $20,000-$50,000.\u201d\n\nNow I don\u2019t know what the fuck a CPAP machine is, but this sounds like it supports my TSLA puts, so I thought I would share.\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2020/04/17/tech/elon-musk-ventilators-california/index.html", "created_utc": 1587209220.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g3m0vi/ventilate_gate/", "is_self": true}
