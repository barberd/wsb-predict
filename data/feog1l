{"id": "feog1l", "title": "Started off last week with $194. Ended this week with $9,475. Almost all SPY and AAPL puts", "selftext": "$194 -- &gt; $1700 --&gt; $4000  -- &gt;  $7500 -- &gt; 3800 ---&gt; $12000 ---&gt; $9475 \n\nLike many of the fine autists that have tread upon these hallowed grounds, I blew my account up 2 years ago during the great Micron ascension then depression as a disciple of the mythological Marty Moho.  Went from $10k-$50k, back down to $10k, then finally blew up my account.  Bought a house. Suffered the wrath of the wife and took a break.  Saw the market was getting stupidly overstretched and batsoup was my opening.  Bought $1000 worth of puts, but the market kept going up like an unstoppable retart.  Had $194 (or some bullshit like that) left and yolo'd SPY and AAPL FDs on a Friday.  As fat would have it, Feb 24th was a massacre and my puts went to $1700.  Basically rolled them and ended this week with $9500.  Had $12000 before the close today, but markets gonna market and shit shot up hard at the end of day and left me with $9500.  Back in the game boys.  Back in the game.  Still holding some puts that I probably shouldn't be, but got hit with a PDT. Moving my money to etrade so I can scrounge some daytrades like a true piece of shit.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nProof. It isn't gay ass Robinhood so if you really care that much you have to deal with trade info. \n\n[https://i.imgur.com/eGbomWa.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/eGbomWa.jpg)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/ZhqF161.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/ZhqF161.jpg)", "created_utc": 1583547003, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/feog1l/started_off_last_week_with_194_ended_this_week/", "is_self": true}
