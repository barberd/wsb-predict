I've been taking screenshots and noticed that traders* will often delete DD that was wrong...stop doing that, own your mistakes and share them with the world like you would loss porn.  Deleting DD makes you seem like a BS shill or a candy ass pansy but more importantly it will make you and us worse traders.\n\n*generous term for the people here", "created_utc": 1592572164.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hc0enn/stop_deleting_dd_where_you_were_wrong_you_wont/", "is_self": true}
