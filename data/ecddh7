{"id": "ecddh7", "title": "PFE: stock with good rally potential", "selftext": "Now that I have purchased my initial tranche, I want to say that PFE (Pfizer) looks really good here for a rally but the stock is vulnerable to a little pullback.  When looking at the chart of the relative strength vs other major stocks and indicies, PFE looks primed for a rally.  In particular, I like the relative strength of PFE vs the QQQs.  The PFE:QQQ ratio looks to have bottomed out.  That provides good safety for traders.\n\nNFLX &gt; PFE &gt; USO\n\nI ranked the 4 stocks above by rally potential.  NFLX is still in the infancy of a rally.  PFE is next up.  USO a decent amount already, so some of the rally potential has been used up.\n\nIf you are interested in the short side, I have a few stocks that are what I consider bearish.  However, I wouldn't short them in this environment because of the high liquidity.\n\nT &gt; GLD &gt; HD\n\nT has the highest short potential of the 3.", "created_utc": 1576679535, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ecddh7/pfe_stock_with_good_rally_potential/", "is_self": true}
