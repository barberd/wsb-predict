{"id": "bpfk7i", "title": "Anyone thinking about hopping onto Luckin Coffee (LK) ?", "selftext": "New IPO out tomorrow. Luckin Coffee. Aiming to become China\u2019s number 1 coffee chain. Founded in 2017 and already has 2,073 stores across 22 cities in China. Best part: the Chinese don\u2019t even drink that much coffee. Only 6 cups per capital annually whereas the US consumes 388 cups per capital. Huge opportunity for growth and interestingly enough, they are being classified as a tech company because they will no longer have cashiers. All orders are made electronically through your phone and deliveries are guaranteed under 30 minutes. Expected to be valued around $4 billion with a 20x price to sales ratio. Seems fairly reasonable. Better than the UBER valuation, that\u2019s for sure. Idk about you guys but I\u2019m hopping in full send on this one.", "created_utc": 1558028443, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bpfk7i/anyone_thinking_about_hopping_onto_luckin_coffee/", "is_self": true}
