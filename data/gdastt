We\u2019ve since seen these stocks appreciate considerably. \n\nI again [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2zhb0/taking_stock_of_tanker_stocks/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) about tanker stocks again two weeks ago encouraging many of you to hold these stocks for longer than your usual holding period of two minutes. Many of you couldn\u2019t resist the urge to take profit in advance of earnings. \n\nThat was a mistake. \n\nEarnings is the catalyst that will drive these companies higher. It\u2019s when management will reveal not only the extent to which they\u2019ve already captured outsized profits on elevated day rates but also when they will guide the market on 2Q and 3Q earnings based on the date rates they\u2019re currently contracted on. I happen to have access to that data, and those contracts happen to be at very high rates. In short, street estimates of earnings are still way too low. \n\nIn my last post I made it clear that street analysts have been too conservative in raising their earnings estimates on tanker stocks. Finally today we have Jefferies analyst raising his PTs and estimates across every tanker stock in his coverage. Just before earnings, of course.\n\nDHT PT raised from $8 to $9, 2020 EPS raised from $2.20 to $2.89.\n\nEURN PT raised from $13 to $15, 2020 EPs raised from $2.66 to $3.89.\n\nFRO PT raised from $10 to $12, 2020 EPS raised from $2.82 to $3.87\n\nTNP PT raised from $5 to $5.50, 2020 EPS raised from $1.50 to $2.13\n\nSTNG PT raised from $30 to $32, 2020 EPS raised from $6.04 to $10.59.\n\nMy plan is to hold through 2Q earnings release, but I do expect this week to be a major week for tankers with multiple names reporting. Specifically, on the calendar this week we got DHT releasing tomorrow (5/5), then STNG (5/6) and EURN (5/7). Should be wild.
