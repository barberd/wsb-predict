About a year ago, I decided to make some rent on them by selling covered calls.  Through definite retardation on my part, I now rolled 6 calls @ 165 to Jan 2021.  So, this is a loser move.  I think it may be $165 in Feb.  Shit only goes up.\n\nHowever, my new plan is to set up margin on that account and roll the calls into like $155 puts. The value of the shares should give me enough to cover this. Then, as time goes by, it just goes away and I get to keep the measly $1500 I made from all the rolls.\n\nBrilliant or retarded?", "created_utc": 1576951694, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/edt517/how_autistic_is_this_msft/", "is_self": true}
