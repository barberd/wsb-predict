I got assigned to sell 200 shares of BYND at $95 per share.  Now my account is up a bunch and I'm restricted from purchasing so I'm not sure what I need to do?  Should I sell the 2 100 BYND calls for a profit?  I'm guessing Robinhood loaned me the money to sell the shares and I would need the money from the $100 calls to pay.", "created_utc": 1560174234, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/byy0t5/sold_a_credit_spread_and_got_assigned_now_what/", "is_self": true}
