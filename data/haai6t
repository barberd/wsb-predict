They trade on a different frequency. Some might say that frequency is retardation. \n\nBut I don\u2019t believe it.\n\nAccording to google 1 Hertz = .000001 MegaHertz\n\nThink of micro e-mini futures and fx. Need more leverage for bigger gain? EZ. Just change the frequency you are trading.\n\ncalls on science bitch", "created_utc": 1592334651.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/haai6t/more_leverage_more_gainz_when_trading_hertz/", "is_self": true}
