Went damn near all in and lost half of it. Suddenly following that play something came to me, it\u2019s a 50/50 market we\u2019re playing here\ud83d\udc3b\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc17right? And that led me to think what if I just place extremely small bets until I go on the longest losing streak of all time and then yolo half my account. \n\nI think it\u2019s only just that I just reference that daily moves comment section that includes everything except for moves for my moves. \n\nI just want to do this and see what happens.
