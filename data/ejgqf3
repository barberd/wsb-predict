To say the markets are a disaster would definitely be an exaggeration right now.\n\nMost social media is joking/serious about the whole ww3 thing. One thing is clear is that 100% Iran will retaliate but how extreme that will be is the question. \n\nThe algos seem to be keeping $SPY stable right now with pre markets going to 319 but coming back up. How deep would you guys get your puts or do you think this thing will fizzle out and calls would be better while everything is a bit lower?", "created_utc": 1578064658, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ejgqf3/ww3_puts_confirmed_or_too_early/", "is_self": true}
