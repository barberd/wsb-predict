As such I have created an alternative finance sub list and request that you kindly Fuck off somewhere else  \n\n\n|Subreddit|Intelligence Level Required|Return on Investment|Fun / Wow Factor|What You'll Learn|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|r/wallstreetbets|Caa1 or Lower|\\-$58,000 USD|Aaa|What not to do|\n|r/investing|C|7-12% Annually|C|Absolutely Nothing|\n|r/Economics|Aa3 or Higher|0% Annually|Ba3|Economics|\n|r/badeconomics|Ba1|0% Annually|A1|Economics|\n|r/SecurityAnalysis|Baa1 or Higher|60,000 USD pretax Annually|B1|Why WeWork is Gay|\n|r/Forex|Ba3|0-15% Annually|B1|How currency pairs work|\n|r/algotrading|A3 or Higher|0% Annually|Caa2|Why you never get filled|\n|r/options|B3 or Higher|0-25% Annually|Ba1|How to actually make money or hedge.|\n|r/StockMarket|Caa1|7-12% Annually|Caa1|Anything else market related.|\n\n  \nSubreddit Overview:\n\n* r/wallstreetbets \\- Wow. In all honesty this sub is great. Keep posting your YOLOs, I enjoy the comments threads on post more than the actual content sometimes. This sub also has by far the most capital on the line, even if a solid 85+% of you guys don't understand how the Federal Funds Rate actually works.  \n\n* r/investing \\- So many cucks. Quite possibly the worst sub in all of eternity. I have to take three shots of single malt to even follow a link that leads me there.  \n\n* r/Economics \\- I actually enjoy this sub but they can be highly pretensions alot of the times. They literally have flairs that denote whether they have an MBA or a full PhD. Even so, If you can get past that, you'll learn a great deal pertaining to economic data and Fed reports. You will be better informed.  \n\n* r/badeconomics \\- If you like r/Economics, you will love r/badeconomics. It is like miniature case studies for all the worlds events. This sub is particularly useful for completely pwning your libtard in-law family next Thanksgiving.  \n\n* r/SecurityAnalysis \\- This sub can be dry af, but it is useful. When alot of controversy is floating around a particular company, this is the place for good DD. I'm talking fundamental Analysis the likes of which you have never seen before, and all done very humbly.  \n\n* r/Forex \\- This sub doesn't really serve any purpose unless you're interested in the Forex market. If you are, or are planning on building a portfolio with currency speculation, visit r/Forex. There are some really good traders here mixed in with the common ravel, and you might actually learn how to appropriately use technical analysis since that is essentially the basis for doing well in foreign exchange markets.  \n\n* r/algotrading \\- There are quite a few amateurs here, which makes sense since functioning completed algo systems are guarded with absolute security, and the talent to build them is incredibly hard to come by. That being said, you can gleam a glimpse into one of the more interesting facets of the market here. Knowing the basics of programming are helpful in navigating posts.  \n\n* r/options \\- I am tired of \"If I buy option xyz and then stock abc does this, then what should I do?\" This sub is great for learning options before you blow up your account. Visit r/options first, then post your loss porn on r/wallstreetbets later. This sub generally takes to the ideas of using options as a hedge which is a bit of a bummer since there appears to be real talent there.  \n\n* r/StockMarket \\- A complete mix of anything involving the markets. I feel like this is what r/investing was meant to be before it was overrun with dividend hoarding schmucks. You'll find good DD, bad DD, veteran bag holders, traders, noobs, and just about anything related to any of the other subs listed above.  \n\n\nI really appreciate this sub but if you are interested in finding something else, here are some communities that might be worth your time.", "created_utc": 1570655556, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dfni49/alternative_subs_for_all_your_dumb_shitposts/", "is_self": true}
