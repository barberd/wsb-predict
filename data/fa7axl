Those numbers will change in your favor (sooner or later) and you can play/try again.  \n\nDD:  if you are media who articles for a few cents a word, and hand jobs are your only income, you would be angry.   Media finds WSB, and realizes they can write negative virus articles and buy puts.   That\u2019s what they do.   Won\u2019t last long.   This virus hype will end.  \n\nWe should start private-bets, membership vetted by proof of funds, losses or wins.   \n\nDon\u2019t forget, we have Trump, Pence (lead on preventing the virus) and Jerome.
