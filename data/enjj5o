Dude runs outside and like ten steps behind him is a sheriff's deputy chasing him outside. The guy gets tackled in the parking lot and they drag him back. Over fried chicken, it doesn't add up to me. Some boomer in the parking lot said he dropped the bags but they kept chasing him.\n\nI've been thinking about going long $100,000 in WMT for the dividend and recession hedge, this is a sign to do it right?", "created_utc": 1578807150, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/enjj5o/i_was_literally_smacked_in_the_face_by_a_pile_of/", "is_self": true}
