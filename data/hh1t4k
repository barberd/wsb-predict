I'm here to bring **TAQUITOS** during these trying times. I have come with fresh research off the tortilla press for my amigos at Wall Street Bets\n\nI'm sitting here getting used to my **NEW  Gigabyte 17 with NVIDIA RTX** that I bought with the **TORO PLAY** from my last DD on CDN infrastructure & serverless computing. It was quite successful, as Fastly rallied beyond the success of market favorites like Zoom.\n\nI need to get used to the keyboard and writing on non-Macs again so I figured to write about my next play. ***Kansas City Southern is a very uniquely positioned business that plays an important role in all of our lives. It is the rail the connects the US and Mexico and it will grow with the release of USMCA on July 1st and Trump's infrastructure bill.***\n\n*My style of investing is principled by exercising common sense and investing in deep market relationships - I am not generally interested in investing in only a product, but how the product fits and its impact on an economic model*\n\n# # USMCA FACTS\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Mexico is critically underbanked and underserved by technology and trade potential.

Mexico and the US have a tightly coupled trading relationship. The USMCA stands to invigorate that relationship and emphasize successes in energy production, manufacturing price parity, and tech-invoked trade access. The exercising of law will result in institutional confidence, resulting in reasonable profits from July-September.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Mexico is Buy American as a nation. It has a tightly coupled relationship with American output.](https://preview.redd.it/jcz0alawji751.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a85687aafa11d3bf4e600e380f08fdea89eea52)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- NAFTA ends June 30th and the USMCA goes into effect July 1st. The US is the last nation ready to prepare the changes.\n\n\\- Trump will soon be under pressure for some form of economic stimulus. This may be in the form of an infrastructure bill by the time September or the election rolls around.\n\n\\- The USMCA modernizes up cross border digital trade and seeks to modernize some structural changes that have transformed in the energy industries invoking industrial surplus. This will increase the rate of exchange\n\n\\- These changes from Facebook (WhatsApp), Walmart, Amazon, Costco, Shopify, Cloudflare, Paypal, and other important supply chain players like **SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS** to supercharge trade between the two nations.\n\n\\- These changes also encourage energy production between US & Mexico, where Mexico has fallen behind and Texas has exceeded.\n\n\\- **NO** this DD is not about the obvious auto-manufacturing benefit. It is an important factor but there is plenty of evidence that only focuses on that element of the USMCA.\n\n\\- Kansas City Southern is one of the ten Class-I Railroads of the US. It is the **ONLY** Class-I Railroad that connects the US & Mexico and runs along the Gulf of Mexico.  This results in streamlined cross-border energy and product trades. This also means that **KSU** **stands to agnostically benefit from economic improvements in energy output and nation building from both the US & Mexico.**\n\n\\- Mexico is an important bulwark nation for the US to bolster as a partner against Chinese economic threat. Its relationship with US is far different than international partners like Germany, India, and Japan. There is a far greater efficiency potential between the two nations across many industries related to logistics, mining, energy, manufacturing, telecom, and agriculture.\n\n\\- Mexico's higher education and English learners have rapidly increased as Mexico radically approaches middle incomes and its narcotics problem. By most accounts, the US is least behind in terms of social policy regarding The Drug War. The US stands to adapt and benefit most rapidly from the economic bottleneck the Drug War has produced.\n\n\\- Migration is complex between the two nations. It is arguably a symbiotic relationship regarding wages, education, crime, and currency parity with respects to US & Mexico.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[1994, the signing of NAFTA was a consequential inflection point in economic history.](https://preview.redd.it/73u5e39bki751.png?width=3045&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a8296fa4d5fb1797d141f936c4809c683b022e4)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Mexico serves as important trading vector and access point to increase global price efficiencies in auto markets, energy, materials, agriculture, and labor.](https://preview.redd.it/c4ej9hcrki751.png?width=638&format=png&auto=webp&s=0062950618749d315101fb97d09237db961e2d40)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# # The Product\n\nKansas City Southern is a relatively small railroad compared to other systems like Union Pacific. You can argue that this is beneficial as is allows the railroad to execute and iterate more rapidly to changes and optimize for efficiencies that larger railroads cannot.\n\nKSU does this with **Precision Railroad Scheduling** along with other Class-I railroads but to great effect. In simple terms, this means that railroads prioritize the scheduling of arrival and departures over the weight and output of each train run. This has resulted in\n\n* Greater speed\n* Greater flexibility to economic changes (Amazon, energy, etc)\n* Greater competition to trucking\n* Increased fuel efficiency\n* Greater economic output\n* Reduced costs for rail trade\n\n*This is an excellent primary for economic growth.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[List of traded goods managed by KSU](https://preview.redd.it/jwed8v3hoi751.png?width=1169&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a1cb82b7dcfa7ab59a727bc50991c9d303e3ef7)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Diversified to benefit & reflect Mexican-American progress](https://preview.redd.it/6qvks6g0oi751.png?width=2386&format=png&auto=webp&s=422e6aa0728e13e9fab0a76893522317a015a9cb)\n\n# \n\n[Institutional restructuring](https://preview.redd.it/bd6h7tpzoi751.png?width=543&format=png&auto=webp&s=3958e442f2cce7001739fbc333689ba5c7a56379)\n\n# \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Market ineffeciencies will rebalance with USMCA changes.](https://preview.redd.it/kjlml0x5pi751.png?width=540&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a4a562b56d075fd1b6c6229f823aa8e5718c3f3)\n\n# \n\n# # The Macroeconomic view of Texas & Nuevo Leon's economic zones\n\nThe reality is that there are logistical positions in Texas and Monterrey trade vectors that is strategically advantageous. Monterrey is a trading city located near the southern border that operates as an important global industrial zone for products and services delivered from Samsung, MSCI Financial, Toyota, Siemens, and the like because the region's geography permits it.\n\nThe story is quite simple. Mexico needs more energy output. Texas has it. Mexican can grow it. The USMCA is designed to directly benefit the economies of Mexico & Texas.\n\nMonterrey, of course, is not the only important vector in Mexico that KSU falls under. Guadalajara, Jalisco houses Tesla operations and runs global avocado trade alongside the State of Michaocan. There are plenty of other examples.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Two cooperative, regional populists at the helm.](https://preview.redd.it/vh7j05cjpi751.png?width=2110&format=png&auto=webp&s=481c9586327f6814f5d86ce923dcc5e5fc139612)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Mexico is primed for American economic bolstering and standardization.](https://preview.redd.it/tvx4tpzspi751.png?width=2099&format=png&auto=webp&s=04572fca1361c4e73db8a38ad1f70672973daa7c)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[KSU overlaps directly with state growth points](https://preview.redd.it/jqk2m167qi751.png?width=1207&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c336ca6fc6ac69001cb648128055a3f85eb95a9)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Mexico's untapped energy potential behaves almost like an extension of Texas and south basin opportunities.](https://preview.redd.it/xy5q9ifrqi751.png?width=1553&format=png&auto=webp&s=0417e4b0890d69eade5084407aff8aab6ca4d34d)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[KSU ultimately double-dips from the changes.](https://preview.redd.it/97regzxvqi751.png?width=1478&format=png&auto=webp&s=49a0575d213a99365721ad3c6513745330d174ec)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Texas GDP 1.8T.
