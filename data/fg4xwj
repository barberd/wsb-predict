Whoever gets the beer virus vaccine or treatments will be rewarded with tendies that will make WSBgod's gains look smaller than MSFT nutella's dick. Vaccines are still a year away and there is no way around it, so I cannot make any proclamations there except to warn you to avoid INO, MRNA, whatever else unless you don't mind losing your money most probably.\n\nHere is where we are with treatments:\n\n1. Remdesivir, $GILD, ongoing phase 3 (NCT04252664, NCT04257656), results in April-May\n2. Favipiravir, Adooq Bioscience (no ticker), RCT, results likely mid-summer\n3. Ribavirin, $MRK, Roche, a bunch of others, RCT, unknown date for results\n4. Lopinavir/ritonavir, $ABBV, ongoing phase 4 in China (NCT04252885), results Aug-Sept\n\nIn practice, 1 &amp; 4 are currently used in severe cases, but 4 is proving useless. There are early signals for 1, and GILD is transitioning from compassionate use to all trials. This could turn a handsome profit to GILD as some evidence suggests prophylactic use can work. \n\nTL;DR: Remdesivir actually seems to work. GILD 90 08/21c to make sure results are published. \n\n(\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08SEC disclosure: no insider knowledge, not involved in trials, just posted recent reports/papers reported.
