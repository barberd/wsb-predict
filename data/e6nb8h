(NKE + $1.37 to $95.10) are moving higher after Goldman Sachs upgraded the athletic apparel maker to \u201cBuy\u201d from \u201cNeutral\u201d, add it to the firm\u2019s Americas Conviction List, while hiking their price target to $112.00 from $95.00. Commenting on the move Goldman analyst Alexandra Walvis stated, \u201cWe believe Nike is a unique asset, where a strong brand combined with a disruptive and innovative strategy are positioning the business for multi-year growth, expansion in margins, and higher returns on invested capital\u201d. Calls are outnumbering puts roughly 5:2 with the December 6th 96.00 call leading the pack (volume is 1,860).\n\nMultiple names are moving higher after reporting earnings:\n\nFive Below Inc. (FIVE + $6.97 to $125.03): The retailer reported Q3 earnings of $0.18 per share ($0.01 beat) on revenue that rose 20.7% year-over-year to $377.4M (above the $373.64M expected) as comparable same-store sales increased by 2.9% year-over-year. In terms of guidance, the company said that Q4 revenue is expected to come in a range of $717-732M (below the $733.30M consensus estimate) while full-year 2020 EPS is expected to come in a range of $3.11-3.19 on revenue of $1.877-1.892B (vs. the respective $3.14 and $1.89B consensus estimates). Calls are outnumbering puts roughly 3:2 with the December 6th 125.00 call seeing the most action from traders (volume is 1,815).\nRH Inc. (RH + $21.52 to $227.15): The home d\u00e9cor retailer reported Q3 earnings of $2.73 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.48 beat) on revenue that rose 6.3% year-over-year to $676.7M (roughly in-line with the $676.54M expected) as subscription revenue came in at $798.5M (above guidance if $783-785M). In terms of guidance, the company stated, \u201cWe expect our operating margin to expand at least 200 basis points in fiscal 2020 and now see a clear path to a 20% operating margin over the next several years. We are increasing our long-term targets to: net revenue growth of 8-12%; adjusted operating margins in the high teens to low twenties; adjusted net income growth of 15-20%; return on invested capital (ROIC) in excess of 50%. Calls are slightly outnumbering puts but the December 6th 190.00 put is topping the most actives list (volume is 2,609).\nVerint Systems Inc. (VRNT - $2.98 to $49.82): The provider of actionable intelligence solutions reported Q3 earnings of $0.94 per share ($0.08 beat) on revenue that rose 7.5% year-over-year to $331.1M (slightly below the $332.96M expected). Concurrent with the earnings release, the company said that its Board of Directors has unanimously approved separating Verint into two independent companies: one which will consist of its customer engagement business and one which will consist of its cyber intelligence business. Looking ahead, the company said it expects full-year 2020 EPS to be $3.65 on revenue of $1.33-1.39B versus the respective $3.64 and $1.37B consensus estimates. Calls are outpacing puts roughly 6:1 with the December 20th 55.00 call being the most actively traded contract (volume is 692).\n \n\nNew 52-week highs (70 new highs today): Allergan PLC (AGN - $0.19 to $186.47), Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY + $0.58 to $59.48), Dexcom Inc. (DXCM - $0.07 to $229.11), JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM + $0.43 to $132.77), Merck &amp; Co. (MRK - $0.09 to $88.58)\n\nNotable Call Activity\n\nSome heavy call activity (~25:1 over puts) is being seen in L Brands Inc. (LB - $0.47 to $18.23) as option traders primarily target the December 13th 20.00 call. Volume on this contract is 20,747 versus open interest of 458, so we know that the activity primarily represents new positioning. The majority of the transactions on this contract consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought at the ask prices of $0.15, $0.20, $0.25 and $0.30, including a 3,878 block that was bought at the ask price of $0.20, which suggests bullish intent.\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb Inc. (BMY + $0.62 to $59.53): Calls are outpacing puts roughly 5:1 which is primarily being driven by activity on the December 6th 59.00 call (volume is 3,213 vs. open interest of 1,365) and the December 13th 60.00 call (volume is 1,718 vs. open interest of 810). Shares of BMY are trading at a 52-week high this morning.\n\nToday\u2019s Bearish Activity \n\nTopping the percentage decliners list this morning is Sage Therapeutics (SAGE - $83.56 to $65.65) after the drug developer said that its experimental drug (SAGE-217) designed to treat severe depression failed to meets its primary endpoints in a pivotal Phase 3 MOUNTAIN study. The company was testing SAGE-217 for a fixed course of 14 days and while the drug demonstrated statistical significance on days 3, 8 and 12, it failed to produce a statistically significant improvement at the 15-day mark. If you are a regular reader of this blog you might recall that back on November 13th SAGE was highlighted under the Volume Signals for a 1,500 contract long butterfly strategy using the December 20th 75.00/100.00/125.00 put strikes. At the time the position was established, SAGE was trading at $144.46 and while the block trader got the direction right (lower), the position is currently in the maximum loss zone (maximum loss is achieved if the stock closes below $75.00 or above $125.00 while maximum gain is achieved if the stock closes exactly at $100.00 at expiration). SAGE calls are outpacing puts roughly 4:1 with the January 2020 80.00 call seeing the most action from traders (volume is 2,248).   \n\nA couple of names are moving lower after reporting earnings:\n\nElastic NV (ESTC - $12.70 to $65.50): The Dutch search company reported a Q2 loss of $0.22 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.09 beat) on revenue that rose 59.0% year-over-year to $101.1M (above the $96.51M expected). Calculated billings increased 41% to $125.3M while total subscription customer count increased ~10% to over 9,700 (both year-over-year). Looking ahead, the company said it expects to report a Q3 loss of $0.34-0.36 per share on revenue of $106-108M (vs. the respective ($0.33) and $105.84M consensus estimates). Calls and puts are trading roughly even with the December 20th 70.00 call seeing the most action from traders (volume is 2,295).\nSlack Technologies Inc. (WORK - $0.55 to $21.11): The cloud-based information security company reported a fiscal Q2 loss of $0.02 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.06 beat) on revenue that rose ~60% year-over-year to $168.7M (above the $156M expected). Looking ahead, the company said it expects to report a Q4 loss of $0.06-0.07 per share on revenue of $172-174M (vs. the respective ($0.07) and $173.02M consensus estimate). Calls are outnumbering puts roughly 3:2 with the December 6th 22.00 call being the most actively traded contract (volume is 3,262).\n \n\nNew 52-week lows (41 new lows today): Benefit Focus Inc. (BNFT - $0.17 to $21.18), Du Pont Inc. (DD - $0.77 to $62.00), Geo Group Inc. (GEO - $0.25 to $13.45), Tilray Inc. (TLRY - $0.18 to $18.58)\n\nNotable Put Activity\n\nSome unusual put activity (~5:1 over calls) is being seen in Chemours Co. (CC - $0.69 to $14.74) which is primarily being driven by activity on the January 17th 2020 14.00 put. Volume on this contract is 4,169 (vs. open interest of 16,198) which mostly consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought at various times at the ask prices of $1.15 and $1.25. However, we can\u2019t be sure that we have any new positioning here given the open interest figure of 16,198.\n\niShares Barclays 20+ Year Treasury ETF (TLT - $0.62 to $139.18): Puts are outpacing calls better than 5:1; notable trades include a 20K block that was sold on the December 20th 137.00 put for $0.70 (open interest is 16,504). We know this block is a new position given the open interest figure and we can assume that the block trader believes that TLT will close at or above the $137.00 price level and/or is comfortable taking a long 2,000,000 share position in this ETF at an effective purchase price of $136.30 if it closes below $137.00 at expiration.\n\nVolume Signals     \n\niShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM + $0.20 to $42.84): The #1 most actively traded contract across the board this morning is the EEM 12/18/2020 30.00 P. Volume on this contract is 108,018 versus open interest of only 65, so it\u2019s likely that all of the volume represents new positioning. Notable block trades on this contract include a 21.28K block that was bought for $0.57 and (at the same time) a 14.72K block that was bought for $0.56 when the bid/ask spread was $0.46 x $0.63. We know these blocks are new positions given the open interest figure and we can assume the intent is bearish in nature since the trades took place above the midpoint of the bid/ask spread.\n\nBarclays PLC (BCS + $0.07 to $8.76): Option volume is running at over 45x the daily average of 166 contracts and the activity is definitively put-biased (~13:1 over calls). The bulk of today\u2019s volume is being driven by a 7,500 block that was bought on the February 2020 9.00 put for $0.68 when the bid/ask spread was $0.55 x $0.70 (open interest is 0). We know this block is a new position given the open interest figure and we can assume the intent is bearish in nature since the trade took place above the midpoint of the bid/ask spread.\n\nEtsy Inc. (ETSY - $0.96 to $41.18): Option volume is running at over 8x the daily average of 2,030 contracts which is primarily being driven by activity on the December 20th 36.50 put. Volume on this contract is 9,013 (vs. open interest of 3) which nearly entirely consisted of a 6,309 block that traded for $0.30 and (at the same time) a 2,704 block that traded for $0.35 when the bid/ask spread was $0.25 x $0.40. We know these blocks are new positions given the open interest figure but the intent is a little unclear.  \n\nGauging Volatility\n\nThe CBOE Volatility Index (VIX - 0.09 to 14.71) has been on both sides of the unchanged line this morning (intraday range is 14.17-15.37) as equity markets are modestly lower across the board around the mid-day mark today (DJI - 57, SPX - 3, COMPX - 13). VIX option volume has been below average today at 136,213 contracts (#7 on the top 10 most actives list) and the activity has been call-biased (the volume put/call ratio is currently 0.40). However, the most actively traded contract is the March 18th 13.00 put as volume is 20,000 versus open interest of 20,970.\n\nShares of ULTA Beauty Inc. (ULTA - $1.58 to $237.84) are trading lower ahead of the company\u2019s Q3 earnings report which is scheduled to be released after the market close today. Today\u2019s option volume has a slight call-bias but the December 6th 205.00 put is seeing the most action from traders (volume is 1,012). Average implied volatility is at a five-year high of 58% heading into the results. Note: the average implied volatility represents an estimated value for a 30-day implied volatility at the current underlying price, based on a curve fit of option implied volatilities.", "created_utc": 1575578725, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e6nb8h/options_market_12519/", "is_self": true}
