{"id": "fkznur", "title": "Rate of Italian Case Growth is Actually Slowing", "selftext": "TLDR: fucked around in excel, buy calls\n\nIf you fit the first 18 days of the Italian outbreak to an exponential, you get the function cases(days)=130\\*e\\^.239\\*days, with an R\\^2 of .996. This curve predicts we\u2019d have 82500 cases by today, but we actually have 35713 cases.\n\nIf you fit the first 22 days of the Italian outbreak to an exponential, you get the function Cases(days) = 190\\*e\\^0.21\\*days. This curve has an R\\^2 of 0.993, and predicts we\u2019d have 55000 cases which is 20000 more than we actually have\n\nIf you fit the entire course of the epidemic to a curve, including today's data (which includes the 4200 new cases) you get Cases = 308\\*e\\^.181\\*cases, this predicts we\u2019d have 40000 cases by today. R\\^2 is .987. And if you plot the last 4-5 days it looks pretty linear with an R\\^2 of 0.998\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo you can see the exponential part is going down and the rate of case growth in Italy is slowing, although they are still living in hell (and I'd encourage those who have gained 10000% in two days to support Italy:  [https://www.forbes.com/sites/catherinesabino/2020/03/17/5-immediate-ways-to-support-italy-during-the-coronavirus-crisis/#15de247e18d5](https://www.forbes.com/sites/catherinesabino/2020/03/17/5-immediate-ways-to-support-italy-during-the-coronavirus-crisis/#15de247e18d5) ).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf pandemic goes down, stonks go up. SPY 300 5/1 is the move.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: The italians are testing like crazy, they tested an entire town:  [https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/aggressive-testing-helps-italian-town-cut-new-coronavirus-cases-to-zero-1.4205354](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/aggressive-testing-helps-italian-town-cut-new-coronavirus-cases-to-zero-1.4205354) ", "created_utc": 1584574449.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkznur/rate_of_italian_case_growth_is_actually_slowing/", "is_self": true}
