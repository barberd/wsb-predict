The coronavirus will go spread unchecked across the emerging world, who have healthcare infrastructure far worse than China. China has been able to contain it better than most middle/emerging countries due to authoritarianism. Over the coming 6 months, there will be millions dead in the streets of Africa, South East Asia and the Middle East. All of this will cause all the money in the world to fly into America, sparking the great roaring 2020s as America is Switzerland for the entire world. \n\nAs oil prices fall around the world due to deaths and quarantine, Middle East tensions will flair up again as the Saudis and Iranians become bankrupt and will have to create chaos to subsidize their young and restless population, which will completely screw China, Japan, Korea, India and the rest of oil dependent Asia. and Putin will try to retake his own CEE/CIS buffers. The world will be awash in chaos and war and the US will be a  bastion of stability without a god damn care in its mind just selling weapons to its allies and collecting money like the good old days. \n\nThis was the same capital flight dynamic from war torn Europe which drove the roaring 20s in the US, displacing London with NYC. The Asian financial crisis and a Japan bust in the 90s created all the liquidity behind dot com. Are you ready for the most epic bubble of YOUR LIVES in the coming years? It is going to be a wild party and you autists are all invited.", "created_utc": 1581438973, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f2auj7/return_of_the_roaring_20s_us_stonks_can_only_go_up/", "is_self": true}
