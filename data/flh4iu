{"id": "flh4iu", "title": "Bankruptcy Targets", "selftext": "Here's my theory to pick some companies that might not make it through this recession...  \n\n1. high debt to income ratio (short on cash)\n2. low insider ownership (going bankrupt won't hurt the guys at the top, they'll just restructure)\n3. large drop in market cap\n4. stock price is still above $10 (no penny stocks, further to drop??? my wife doesn't fuck any boyfriends with less than 10\")\n\nLots of OTC stocks, but there are a few NYSE and Nasdaq gems that might go under.  My real purpose of doing this DD though, is to get some ideas from other retards, because I don't hear anyone talking about going to zero around here. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/w2z981v", "created_utc": 1584649607.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flh4iu/bankruptcy_targets/", "is_self": true}
