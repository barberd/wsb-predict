Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's REALLY, REALLY SHITTY advertising ([https://youtu.be/u6r39Hs6Lpw](https://youtu.be/u6r39Hs6Lpw)) has been about 90% of all of my YouTube pre-roll, mid-roll advertising. I've also seen them on takeovers of shitty overpriced digital publications, and display all over the place. They must be spending a FORTUNE.\n\nIm am literally their anti-target demo.\n\n1. Im am a 30M w/ an Amazon Prime account.\n2. I've never been (nor anyone in my household) been to their website or category similar website or Googled anything similar (so it isnt even retargeting).\n3. The last time i purchased anything from that store was I think 2012?\n\nI did walk into a BB&amp;B back in 2015 to buy a Wok .. but they didnt have any in stock, so I ordered it off Amazon Prime on my phone before i walked back to my car.\n\nAnyway .. you know what these advertisements remind me to do .. go to Amazon Prime and buy the same shit they sell without having to wait in line for the 65 year old woman paying with coupons + exact change. \n\nOh and by the way .. the advertising is BRAND ADVERTISING .. like not even discount or product specific advertising. Their marketing department is literally operating like they are buying digital media in 2005.\n\nShort this fucker.
