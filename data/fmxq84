The severe lack of content at 6am on a Sunday morning is insane.\n\nI\u2019m can\u2019t sleep because I can only smell the amount of TENDIES to be had on Friday. Please guys I need quality WSB content immediately.\n\nTLDR: I\u2019m gonna fucking die if you guys don\u2019t post at 5 am on Sunday mornings.
