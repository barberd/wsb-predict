Oh but no, they have a desktop version..... annnnnd, word, it\u2019s just an even more shitty RH app in website form. Mutated disaster.\n\nLike I get it, the simplicity is cool and it is probably great for a good portion of the users, but Jesus fuck I see zero downsides to partnering with tradingview or similar trading platforms. RH has been and is going to be losing clients, like myself. I just switched to TD, and I know many others will soon unless they give their traders a bloody fackin proper platform to use and then they won't lose clients. Fucking tits man.\n\nand YEAH, I DID LOSE BIG THIS WEEK ON FUCKING USO CALLS I AM RETARTED THANKS\n\n\\`", "created_utc": 1587224455.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g3picy/angry_saturday/", "is_self": true}
