Tesla's market cap didn't break 4B until 3 years in.\n\nThe deal price for VTIQ and Nikola to merge is $10, and that gives the company a generous valuation at 3.3B.\n\nAll current shareholders of VTIQ receive 1 for 1 share in the new merged company. But here is the problem, the new merged company has 402 million shares outstanding, compared to the 29m the VTIQ has now. That doesn't even take into account the warrants that could be exercised, if not recalled, diluting the value further.\n\n**Whats that mean?** The stock price of VTIQ is valuing the merged company at Around 10.5 billion as of this post. 10.5 billion for a company that won't even have a product until 2022 according to their own report. A company that will surely need to issue more debt to fund growth  or even just operations.\n\nLook, if you wanna get into the future of transportation and feel like you missed out on Tesla and think Nikola could be next, I recommend waiting to build your position until after the merger is complete and the meme stock attention has moved on. Nikola may be a great company... in 4 years... but its not going to be the next Tesla between now and then, if ever.\n\nJune 2nd is when the vote is scheduled to confirm the merger.  Buying this stock at anything over $15 before the merger is complete, for any reason, is just asking to get crushed when it comes crashing down.\n\nDo your own DD if you think I'm blowing smoke.\n\nScroll to the end for the easy to read presentation.\n\n[https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-028233/](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-028233/)", "created_utc": 1589467625.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gjnq9l/vtiq_is_a_pump_and_you_know_it/", "is_self": true}
