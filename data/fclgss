I was hella mad when the app crashed because GILD was going up and rocketing towards the moon.\n\nProof : [https://imgur.com/IY84tpq](https://imgur.com/IY84tpq)\n\nI was hoping my order to fill because my Strike was 72.5 and GILD was trading at 75 towards EOD.\n\nAt 4:37 PM I got an email saying my order got executed at 12:55 PM and of course I am super happy. I am just wondering if this happened with anyone else too?\n\nProof : [https://imgur.com/3qJHOBF](https://imgur.com/3qJHOBF)\n\nI am still mad at Robinhood though, I was gonna get VXX puts at open but thanks to Robinhood.
