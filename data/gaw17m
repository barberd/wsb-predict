Three meetings a day means one person counts three times.\n\nIn a statement to The Verge, Zoom says the wording was \"a genuine oversight on our part.\"\n\nYesterday, Zoom competitor Microsoft Teams said it now has 75M DAUs, up from the 44M reported last month.\n\nZoom shares are down 5.8% pre-market to $138.", "created_utc": 1588254661.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gaw17m/zm_zoom_fake_daily_user_numbers_bubble_go_boom/", "is_self": true}
