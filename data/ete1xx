Long $RICE", "selftext": "Facts:\n\n-China doesn't give a flying fuck about killing/ torturing their own people (evidenced by communist party killing over 100m chinese in last 70 yrs) \n-China has huge Hong kong problem and needs a distraction \n-Vaccines for this are reportedly 3 to 6 months away from a clinical trial \n-China has experience from the Hong Kong SARS breakout (essentially a sibling of the current outbreak) \n-China has been able to lock down 35 million people on quarantine ( the same population as spain) and nobody is batting an eye\n-Chinese dictator Xi appeared on state TV in Beijing, an infected city, without a mask and everyone with him also had no mask. \n\nQui Bono? ( Latin for \"who benefits?\" For the retards here) \n-China, they crack down on dissent, stop HK protests,  and also punish Americas economy for the trade war (stocks are already slipping down) \n\nConclusion: \n\nChina engineered this virus with all their samples and experiences from SARS, secretly developed a vaccine for high ranking officials, unleashed the virus to cull populations to halt dissent, stop HK protests, and do a rally around the flag to unite the country. Also they hurt the US economy and maybe crash it enough to get Orange Man booted from office becuase all other candidates will be softer on China on trade", "created_utc": 1579889063, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ete1xx/my_autistic_dd_on_chairman_poohs_galaxy_brain/", "is_self": true}
