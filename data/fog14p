(3/27 0p $ME)", "selftext": "Hey you fucking idiots,\n\nI have been spending a whole load of time on here for the past few months, and luckily made a good amount of money too. This place helped me wake up to how fucked we were as a species, and also make money from it.\n\nAnyways, to cut the shitty part, I think I have the virus. I want to give you all a heads up about how it is is manifesting in myself so you can maybe not kill your own families accidentally. \n\nI was studying abroad in Europe (Dublin, specifically) and had to leave early last week before I got fucking stuck because of daddy Donald. Showed no symptoms, had no known exposure, etc. Had a light scare where a coworker was suspected of having it, but luckily he and his wife were tested and just had some bad non-bat flu strain. \n\nToday however, I got confirmation from one of my former roommates that he has tested positive (that shit pisses me off too - he said he was showing no bad symptoms and I think he only got one because his daddy is a FL state senator or something).\n\nHe said he showed no symptoms except for congestion. Keep in mind this guy is medically obese, has one of the worst diets I've ever seen, binge drank by European standards on an almost nightly basis, and had hygiene that would make the average WSB user look like a a recruit in the military who just got beat in the middle of the night with bars of soap.  \n\nEven worse, this guy was almost never in the room when I was, and we never hung out. This shit must have just lingered in the air if I caught it from him. I figure it is either that or the restroom. No clue, and that scares the shit out of me because it feels like if you look at someone the wrong way with this they will die. \n\nNow, for symptoms:\n\n I have had a consistent temperature of 99.6 for the past few days (at first it was off and on, now it seems to be hanging around)\n\nI have started feeling chest congestion, and a light cough is developing. Although not too bad yet, it definitely matches similar reports I've read. General sinus congestion as well, though this may  just be the usual stuff I deal with. \n\nFatigue. Although I thought this was probably due to my fucked up sleep schedule from waking up for markets and jet lag, I realized today it isn't. I feel like I could sleep all day, and I have been sleeping way way more than normal the past week. This was probably the first symptom that hit, and I wish I would have taken way more precautions, but I wrote it off as nothing. \n\nAnyways, I don't mean to say I'm going to die, but I don't fucking know. I am healthy and young, but that doesn't mean this shit can't clog my lungs and stop me from breathing. Stay safe you fucking idiots, seriously, If not for yourselves, stay the fuck away from old people and your parents (who are likely also pretty old unless you  were a very early broken condom or 15 years old and trading on your dad's 401k). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll post updates if anything happens. I am not getting tested for now because I do not want to strain resources, but I will if things get worse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Fuck you just read I'm dying", "created_utc": 1585093746.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fog14p/looks_like_i_have_the_bat_flu_327_0p_me/", "is_self": true}
