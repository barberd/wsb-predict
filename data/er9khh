I need one of you other autistis with the same power that I hold to buy and hold.  That power being the ability to instantly make a stock go down and ensure madness and chaos towards the stock within moments of buying.\n\nFor example, I was a spy Bull and overnight WW3 happened.  First time buying SPY calls and yes, we went to war overnight.   Fun times.  That being said, I don't wanna make AMD or TSLA suddenly bankrupt by buying into it currently so if someone else could do it that'd be great.  I really would prefer not to have that on my conscience.  \n\nIf anyone is willing to bite the bullet, please let me know beforehand so I can free up some money.  As much detail as possible would be appreciated.  For example, \"ill be buying at market open, and selling at around a 10% loss\" so I will know when to buy and so forth.  This would all be greatly appreciated.", "created_utc": 1579502972, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/er9khh/i_want_to_buy_amdtsla_but_i_dont_wanna_ruin_the/", "is_self": true}
