My \\^ position on this stonk is still in it even after it went down to $22.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom a previous post of mine:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLittle synopsis: Enphase Energy makes microinverters for solar panels that other companies install. Their microinverters create a decentralized power source such that if a solar panel is malfunctioning, the rest of the panels will continue to produce solar energy. This is in contrast to centralized systems where if one panel is down, the whole system gets wonky.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking at ENPH\u2019s financials, they are now net positive in profits and have increased in value significantly. This company is invisible to the average investor because the way this company operates is very intricate and not well known.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n TLDR: Long ENPH now!!", "created_utc": 1569007686, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d6zul9/who_still_has_enough_psychotic_delusion_to_buy/", "is_self": true}
