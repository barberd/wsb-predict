Its not like a fucking boomer stock or anything, and this shit is also gonna rely on the upcoming 5G data transfer and network infrastructure evolution already underway.\n\n\\*You need to understand that 5G wireless technology is REVOLUTIONARY.  I'm too lazy to pull up the EXACT numbers, but this tech is going to reshape society in the way the Industrial Revolution revitalized America's domestic confidence almost 100 years ago.  \n\nAnyway, we are actually heading into the 'second phase' of 5G's rollout and what that means for stonks now is that companies involved in TESTING 5G equipment (small cells, RF / antennas, and semi-conductors...), as well as the SUPPLIERS of 5G COMPONENTS to the big companies that will use this obviously which include Apple or Samsung or At&amp;T...  so this means Apple isn't benefitting the most from this at the moment...  and ultimately by 'Phase 3' of 5G rollout, the stocks that will benefit the most are the service products that utilize 5G to revolutionize various industries (including health).\n\nso basically $TDOC leaps are a potential 10 bagger play for phase 3 (thats my bet at-least) because they will allow you to order prescriptions / see your doctor over a smart phone rather than physical visit.  This and similar services will save a lot of time for a lot of people.  (These services using 5G capabilities will become MORE useful for automating smaller tasks for businesses to save money like just a basic prescription renewal visit) and by the way companies like CVS will eventually offer medication Delivery...  \n\nbut yeah also any comments or thoughts are welcome", "created_utc": 1582841738, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fak14u/teladoc_health_tdoc_and_other_wireless_at_home/", "is_self": true}
