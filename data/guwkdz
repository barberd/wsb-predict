{"id": "guwkdz", "title": "Broadcom $(AVGO) upcoming earnings play", "selftext": "Their earnings are coming up in a few days - 6/4. Not sure why the date is more publicized, Robinhood and Yahoo doesn't have it correct for instance, but yeah now is your chance to get in before the earnings run-up.\n\nThey are a massive semi-conductor company, meaning they make all sorts of tiny, unique parts for all sorts of devices. Apple is totally reliant on them, as are many, many other tech companies. They made most of the internal wireless antennas for the last generation of cell phones, and they are making most of the next gen ones too.\n\nNvidia is also basically a semi-conductor firm and look at their recent results. I think AVGO will go on a similar run. It's just a clutch industry for the big boys.\n\nStill around 20% under pre-corona levels, unlike most stocks in tech.\n\nIVs for June 19th are literally still less than 40%, you will make a killing just from the IV crush.\n\nVery well run company. Rarely miss earnings, but did so in Q1 2020, so lowered expectations this time around. Almost every analyst has them with a Buy or Strong Buy rating.\n\nI personally will be buying 6/19 $330 and $340 calls.", "created_utc": 1591057097.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/guwkdz/broadcom_avgo_upcoming_earnings_play/", "is_self": true}
