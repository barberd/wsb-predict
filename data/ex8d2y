{"id": "ex8d2y", "title": "Why Coronavirus is NOT the flu", "selftext": "A lot of bulls seem to respond to fear of coronavirus posts by saying that the flu kills more people. I see that point, and hopfully the coronavirus won't have as high of a death rate as the flu, but for at least the next week or two, I don't think the market will care because panic and fear of the unknown is currently driving the market. The biggest earnings week of this season is already behind us. We know how to deal with the flu (more or less) and no one freaks out about all the lives it claims every year. However, coronavirus is too new, so the reactions that governments have put in place to combat it (quarantines, lock downs) will have a negative impact on GDP worldwide. Of course stonks only go up in the long term, but I would be careful of buying calls too soon right now. Just tryna look out for you boys. Even though options is a zero sum game, I'd like to think we can all make money and rise together.", "created_utc": 1580573775, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ex8d2y/why_coronavirus_is_not_the_flu/", "is_self": true}
