{"id": "b6r67s", "title": "New Chinese Meme Stonk (basic DD inside)", "selftext": "I'm always looking for something to fill that gaping hole left by IQ, HUYA, BILI and all the other meme stonks that made my portfolio skyrocket last spring...\n\nAnd this time, I'm gonna lock-in profits before it bottoms out after the pump and dump is over, goddammit. \n\nLadyboys and Gentlemen, I present to you TIGR.\n\nUP Fintech Holding Ltd is a brokerage service for Chinese folks to trade Chinese and US stonks. It's an app. And it's popular. Think Chinese Robinhood with a potential customer base roughly 10x what RH has. The stonk ticker is TIGR. \n\nFrom their site - \n\nWe are the largest online broker focusing on global Chinese investors in terms of U.S.\u00a0securities trading volume, with a market share of approximately 58.4% in 2017. \n\n\nFrom other sources - \n\nThe rapidly growing company said that during the fourth quarter the turnover rate on its platform was 1,496 percent. The conversion rate and retention rate of customers were as high as 15 percent and 82 percent as of Dec. 31 and in 2018, respectively.\n\nIts revenue nearly doubled year-over-year to $33.6 million in 2018, though the firm's net loss reached $44.3 million compared with a loss of $7.9\u00a0million for the prior year. \n\nXiaomi has a 14.1 per cent stake in Up Fintech while Interactive Brokers Group, one of the largest electronic brokers in the United States, has a 9.5 per cent stake. The biggest shareholder is its founder, Wu Tianhua.\n\nAccording to the prospectus, Up Fintech\u2019s total trading volume reached US$119.2 billion in 2018 from US$16.3 billion in 2016 and US$63.3 billion in 2017.\n\n\nFrom CNBC - \n\nI'm not gonna post shit from CNBC as per the mods, and because CNBC gives everyone diarrhea. \n\n\nSo - \n\nIt's losing money hand over first while expanding rapidly as hell. Sound familiar? A recipe for success and likely huge swings once options gambling becomes available. Low reporting requirements means lots of room to fudge their numbers. \n\nMark yer calendars:\n\nQuiet period ends 4/29/2019. \nLockup period ends 9/16/2019. \n\nThey IPO'd two weeks ago under the radar at $8 and have had a steady climb to $13 before dipping back to $12 today. Up 50% in two weeks, you say? Yessir, it's a good ole reliable Meme Stonk. High risk. Meet your new daddy Pappa Wu. \n\nAnd they have an English version of their site - \n\nhttps://www.itiger.com/?lang=en_US\n\n\nTL;DR: TIGR is the new meme stonk on the NasD.
