Ref: Blackrock Hedge Fund\nBTC:\n\n166NccfDmSbnoDE3NWh85E9j2hiFDja5mJ\n\n\nFirstly below is a link to the strategy being run on Gold, if you go to Yahoo Finance you can download data from other instruments and run it and you\u2019ll see it works on most of them. I\u2019d suggest using portfolio theory to maximise gains. \nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/16qwY1t71GvDuvduJ1qltX3ejB6xUGCku/view?usp=sharing\nGOLD\n\nThe equation is simple, unlike the first one, it's E=MC^2.\nExponential Growth =\u00a0 Money Compounded upwards with the second moving average!\n\nProcess\n1) Daily Charts at 5X leverage. You can get this on eToro for example.\n2) If instrument is above the SMA2 at the end of the trading day you invest, if it is below the SMA2 you close your position\n3) If the instrument is above the SMA2 at the end of the day and you have an open position you close the position and compound in your gains, therefore multiplying the profit by 5X for the next trading day. If you have an open position and the instrument is below the SMA2 you close the position and check back the next trading day to see if you invest, the next day, if above the SMA2 you reinvest minus the loss from the losing day.\n\nExample:\nT0) GOLD is above the SMA2 on the daily charts. You invest \u20ac100 @5X leverage, which means you have \u20ac500 in play on the market.\nT1) GOLD has risen 1% and the chart shows again it is above the SMA2, so you have made \u20ac5 profit, considering this is 1% of \u20ac500. You then close the trade and reinvest the \u20ac105 so you now have \u20ac525 at play in the markets.\nT2) GOLD drops by .5% so you now have \u20ac522.375 on the market at the end of the day. You close the position so now for the next open day you have \u20ac104.475, because the GOLD market is below the SMA2 you are not reinvesting that day.\nT3) Gold drops again by .5%, you are not in the market so you have made no loss, you see it is below the SMA2 so you do nothing again this day and do not invest.\nT4) Gold rises by .5% and you see it is now again above the SMA2, so you invest the \u20ac104.475 in the market at 5X leverage.\n\nAlso, this is why;\n\nhttps://youtu.be/DIohBuemqgA", "created_utc": 1584315814.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjb2dj/have_some_infinite_money/", "is_self": true}
