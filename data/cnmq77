Short China etf (FXI) if you want to hedge it.  I think we got some upside move into the end of August before the tariffs kick in.  For the folks who really want to go ballsy on options.  I'd buy puts on FXI and short puts on QQQ.  If the IV is too much on FXI, you could flip it into calls with short calls on FXI and long calls on QQQ.", "created_utc": 1565275428, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cnmq77/pretty_extreme_action_the_last_couple_of_days/", "is_self": true}
