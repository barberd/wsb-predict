My fianc\u00e9 knows I trade options and hates it. We are on the way to Destin, FL to elope. Covid fucked our wedding up so here we go. Anyway, I asked her to borrow $10k for $307 SPY 6/26c in the Uber. She lost her train of thought mid conversation and is gazing out the window. I told her I was kidding. I hope someone finds the humor in this, like i did.... As I place orders :) . Any way...  best of all today. Should be a green Friday. 6/29 SPY $307 is my pick of the day. Set your stops and limit boys and girls....\n\nCheers!!", "created_utc": 1591967264.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h7kdbr/just_asked_fianc\u00e9_for_10k/", "is_self": true}
