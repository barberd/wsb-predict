{"id": "fazh5n", "title": "My Entire Portfolio is SPY Puts. How fucked/rich will I be?", "selftext": "I sold my CCL, RCL, NCLH puts near the bottom today. No complaints there, good profit. My autism then decided to YOLO my entire account into super OTM 3/4 SPY puts. I have a vertical put spread as of now. Most of my SPY positions are printing. But the big YOLO I made was when the SPY price was at $290 so that one is down/even as of now. And that position is like 75% of my portfolio.\n\nI\u2019m planning on holding for the weekend cuz no way beer virus gonna get better. We are not at the bottom. And historically this year, Fridays have been down going into the weekend.\n\nQuestion: will I be printing or GUH come Monday?\nAnyone else you hard one SPY puts? \n\ud83d\udc8e hands!", "created_utc": 1582915578, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fazh5n/my_entire_portfolio_is_spy_puts_how_fuckedrich/", "is_self": true}
