{"id": "ceizqq", "title": "Cinderella Story", "selftext": "So...I work for a VERY fast growing privately held company that recently publicly announced its merger with another publicly traded company. They are the one of largest companies in my industry. Our number one competitor (a 12.5 BILLION dollar company) just lost their distribution contract with the company that bought 49 percent of my company and we won the contract. The price of the company we merged with is under $5 a share, and is a globally recognized brand, and is distributor of certain industry specific products and owns several easily recognizable global brands. How do I tell you guys who these companies are without getting into trouble, (even though the press release is public) and what do I do when I know we are going to do HUGE things next year...HUUUUUGE things, like double our product lines in 4 departments, increase production by at LEAST 1000% and have our product in 38 new countries....I feel like the SEC is already outside....that doesn't sit well with my social anxiety, or cocaine habit.... I also feel like the merger didn't move the price of the stock at all, so it may have been \"priced in\" already, but at $5 a share I think not. I will not under any circumstances disclose the names of these companies. (There are like 10,000,000 circumstances where I totally would).  I also think I get some kind of options as part of my employment package. Right to exercise blah blah blah, insider this or that, I don't have a clue but I just got some stupid app with a green chart so I feel confident that I can make money. I will check back with you guys at the end of the week, I think I hear a knock on my office door, I'll be right back....", "created_utc": 1563398203, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ceizqq/cinderella_story/", "is_self": true}
