Don't be afraid of being highly concentrated in naked calls. Do your DD and monitor Jim Cramer, then double down if needed.\n\n5. Chase fads. Pets.com. Bitcoin. Weed. If you are in it for the long term you should be in meme stocks. Better yet, use their products. I personally add pet hair to my weed juul vape juice.\n\n6. Taxes are only paid by the poor. Use Roth accounts, HSA, 401k, ect. Try to avoid long-term gains as much as possible.\n\n7.
