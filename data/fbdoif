Modest 30-50k a year on average.\n\nFucking take your profits. I would set a goal for myself, and when I hit it I would cash out 50%, take a long ass walk to my car, and put the cash or chips in the glovebox so when i got tilted and decided to gamble i would have to take 30 minutes to go to my bankroll before I could decide whether to sit back at the table. I'd smoke a cigarette and buy some lo mein.\n\nCheck out legendary poker pro chris Ferguson's bankroll management challenge. [dingus guide](https://www.realmoneypokertips.com/bankroll-management/chris-ferguson-bankroll-management-guide.html) you can still be a YOLO fuck and play responsibly. The numbers are different for stonks but I set rules for myself. Never have more than 75% of my portfolio invested. Dump a gain of 300%. Drop a loss at 50%. You'll ignore these rules. Delete the app and do pushups. Get tested for coronalite, then invest again. \n\nI've been doing the same, transferring to my bank account instantly after culling profit here, and delete the apps for a few days, disconnect my bank account, while waiting for experies and tracking markets. At the least, I will have to wait 2 minutes for the app to reinstall and remember my goddamn password before logging in again. \n\nThe worst mistake you can make, and I can't stress this enough, is not being happy with your fucking profits. I felt that burn when I sold my SPCE puts when it hit $29 and then it crashed even more and I could have tripled profits. That's when I transferred the winnings, deleted the app, and the next morning I realized I was a neuro diverse psycho fuck for not being happy when I looked at my bank account.\n\nI've gone up and down but made more than I did in my whole time playing poker, starting with a smaller roll. Can't figure out how to screenshot schwab because they fucking blow donkey balls so I'm not gonna post profits, but I've done well.\n\nAlso feel your vibe and feel free to be bi. We're in 2020, no one cares if you wanna fuck bears or bulls, wave your Switzerland flag with pride. Cut losses, play opposite sides, make dumb plays, and own your shit. \n\nOr toss it all on 3/4 $250 spy puts idgaf.", "created_utc": 1582988514, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fbdoif/former_semi_pro_poker_player_here_some_bankroll/", "is_self": true}
