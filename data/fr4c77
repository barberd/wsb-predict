Why? They lose money with every ride! So, how are they even a thing then? They are trying to control market share while automated cars get developed and approved. Their valuation is 100% brand and market share. Everything else, like driving people around burns investment money. \n\nThe self drive car tech is still going forward despite the beer flu. However UBER and LYFT get to pause the bleeding. Uncle Sam is paying the drivers extra to sit on their ass! The market share is not going anywhere, as who is going to try and take it while beer flu is going on? Also will states keep going after them for labor laws? Nope, they will love it if they hire people at all...\n\nThey all seem to have enough cash to wait this out (over a year) so long term I think they will be fine. Yes they will follow the market but if it goes low enough I might even buy a few stocks. So don't expect them to go to 0.\n\nSpy 140 6/19.   link for gay bear porn shot before Fridays open https://imgur.com/gallery/5664Gsn", "created_utc": 1585480397.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fr4c77/why_this_flaming_gay_bear_does_not_have_the_gay/", "is_self": true}
