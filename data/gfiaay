I came across OIH, VANECK VECTORS /OIL SVCS ETF NEW and something caught my interest. If I check the history of the etf in my Robinhood app it indicates the etf was trading low. Very low. As low as the $4 range in April then suddenly spikes to over $80 by April 15th. However when I check the same stock ticker OIH with Google, anywhere else there is a different story that is told. According to elsewhere it was trading it was up in the $200 dollar range then dipped into the $60 dollar range at its low point. What gives? Why am I seeing these to different history for the seemingly same etf? I thought I\u2019d bring this question to Wallstreetbets to see what you guys had to say.
