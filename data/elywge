Of course, SPY spiked around 3 and I started to piss myself. I doubled down and bought more puts and with 10 minutes to spare, SPY dipped and I ended up positive over 3k. I can post a screenshot but I don\u2019t know how (on account of the autisticness). Can someone tell me how to do that and I\u2019ll edit.", "created_utc": 1578517605, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/elywge/what_an_emotional_rollercoaster/", "is_self": true}
