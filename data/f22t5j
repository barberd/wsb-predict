What does this mean? The video has just been recommended to thousands of random people. As a result l, thousands will be pouring into Denny\u2019s around the nation to eat a grand slam and hopefully see a metal band perform. This is gonna send eps through the roof \n\nMark my words, Denny\u2019s is going to explode after earnings. Get on the tendie train before it\u2019s too late.", "created_utc": 1581393925, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f22t5j/grand_slam_dd/", "is_self": true}
