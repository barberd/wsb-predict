I have watched VGTRK, CNA, China Uncensored, RT, CNBC-AFRICA (videos on China's colonization process), and other YouTube channels to figure who will win the trade war.  I have also watched videos from SPIEF, World Economic Forum, and I came to one fact: Russian Agriculture is the winner.  \n\nEven if the trade war ends, China holds grudges.  I am confident they'll slowly shift their pork and dairy imports source to Russia.  Canadian meat is banned, and it's due to the certificate scandal.  Canadian canola also is banned due to some \"insecticide issue\". Another evidence of China's revenge trade is holding up Australia coal, and sending three battle ships after the 5G ban.  Mercedes had to kowtow to China when one of their employee accidentally quoted Dalai Lama for a car picture ad.\n\nChina is consistent, and I'm sure they will slowly shift their trade from America and Canada to Russia for agriculture.\n\nSources:\n1) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4USQ-8ZEg0 - Russian dairy industry increasing.\n2) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCN_D9EfgQ - Total agriculture\n3) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8blm47kaJOo - Russian soy\n4) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrDu34wfLRI - Russian farm saved from China\n\nI'm thinking of flying to Russia and see if I can get into this action, or is there a ETF for this?", "created_utc": 1561608618, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c60tg7/russian_agriculture_is_the_future/", "is_self": true}
