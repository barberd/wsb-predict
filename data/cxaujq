Just let it sit out there for a while, wait until the scammers start latching on to it posing as princes, financiers from Dubai, etc.\n\nOnce you get an email, explain that you are, \"American CEO of Manufacturing Company Ohio, sell Chopstiks,\" and make sure to litter it with all sorts of spelling and grammatical errors and sound really panicked.  Explain that you sell chopsticks, but due to the China tariffs your business has been in huge trouble, and that you are looking for a market for chopsticks.\n\nInevitably they will ask for money, and a bank transfer of some kind.  Agree to this, agree to whatever their terms are, and then say that you made the transfer to their bank account.  Attach a PDF and say, \"OK, bank transfer went through, here is your receipt.\"  On the PDF, there should be a clickable link, which brings them to a website that you have created and installed Google Analytics on, so that you can monitor and look for visits from that link, and capture their IP address.\n\nOnce you have their IP address and their bank account information, now you can threaten them and let them know that you will report them to authorities, unless THEY give YOU money.", "created_utc": 1567132378, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cxaujq/american_manufacturing_ceo_scam/", "is_self": true}
