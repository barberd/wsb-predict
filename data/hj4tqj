{"id": "hj4tqj", "title": "The tech bubble is a gay bear fantasy", "selftext": "Remember back early in 2020, back when people were complaining about some little fires in Australia and the bat flu was this funny chinese meme where people got forcibly locked in their homes? \n\nPeople said tech was a bubble and there was a general sense of \"this is too good to be true\" and the general expectation of some sort of recession. A recession just had to happen, man.\n\nThen the bat flu left the yellow shores of china and there was the cough heard round the world. By mid-march though, tech was back on the menu. And importantly, all that recession fear was gone, because the lockdown proved that tech is here to stay. \n\nCurrent tech is very different from dot com because people and companies actually use (and pay for--or get advertised via) a lot of these products like zoom, slack, office, spotify, uber, google, etc. Lockdown definitively proved it's sorta necessary and not just early adopter bs. So yeah, it makes sense that tech has rallied above pre-covid highs.\n\nHere's the other thing. A lot of people's habits have changed, and habits will take real time to reform and return. I know people who couldn't pour milk in cereal who are now broiling fish and veggies with fucking cumin. I attended a virtual fucking happy hour to network for a job (bat flu got my job). I would have pump-shottied myself in the jaw 6 months ago if I knew that future me would do that kind of faggot bs.\n\nAnyways, I'm coming out as a bull, motherfuckers. I don't think tech is overvalued. Shit is different now, I think Jimmy Buffet and his Omaha steak sauce pensieve was right. Sure, Jpow is printing, but he's really only filling in the relatively small-ish gap created from the bank's pullback on leverage (normally around $20T). Deflation could also be an issue, not just inflation.\n\nMSFT 220c 9/18, NET 40c 8/21, SE 115c 8/21\n\nAlso, I really hate ebay and hope it dies an ugly, fraud-filled death. When I get my portfolio past $50k I'll allow myself to buy some 2022 puts to fuel my hatred.", "created_utc": 1593584268.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hj4tqj/the_tech_bubble_is_a_gay_bear_fantasy/", "is_self": true}
