Its holdings are comprised of 67 financial institutions, as seen below (more on this later): \n\n \nList of all financial institutions:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/zrfWwzN.png\n\n The options are very cheap, and with the economy booming and everything on the verge of opening, the financial sector is looking ready to go back to pre-covid levels. Essentially, this is a very cheap entry for the potential of a very big payout. Their holdings are also very strong, with their top 3 being Berkshire Hathaway Class B (BRK.B), JP Morgan (JPM), and Bank of America (BAC). Their other holdings are also very good; however, for the sake of simplicity and keeping this succinct; I will only focus on the top three as they carry the most weight. Furthermore, with the Fed restarting repo operations on Monday, 6/8, the financial sector should see a bigger boost. A bit speculatory, but I expect the stock market to keep going up until either of the two following events occur: 1) second wave of COVID and/or 2) Trump wins/loses the re-election. I do not see the stock market faltering until after the election as the stock market recovery, and really the economy in general, is Trump's greatest strength right now. \n\nAnyway, what I like to do is to look at current trends and compare them to similar trends in the past. I know some of you will think TA is wishy-washy and not always accurate, especially in the current stock market climate when cash infusion is at an all-time high. That being said, I\u2019ve been using this strategy to play XLF with major success in the past 3 weeks. The three main indicators I like to follow are the Aroon indicator, MACD, and the momentum indicator. I do use other checkpoints, such as moving averages, support/resistance/Bollinger bands, etc., but will not further discuss those findings here in order to keep it somewhat simple. All TA was done using TOS and Finviz. Findings can also be recreated on Tradingview using the built-in indicators. \n\n&nbsp;\n\t\n**BRK.B:**\n\n-\t**Aroon:** Downward trend noted this past Friday, 6/5; however, it looks like we can ignore this specific indicator as historically, it looks like it didn\u2019t predict significant downward movement. \n-\t**MACD:** Recently went positive, historically it looks like this caused the stock to trend upward a good 50-60% of the time. \n-\t**Momentum:** Shows an upwards trend since the end of May, historically linked with continued growth for the coming weeks when momentum broke 0.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**JPM**:\n\n-\t**Aroon:** Downward trend, but can be ignored. Same reason as up top. Moving averages here shed a bit more positive light on predicted movement of this stock. \n-\t**MACD:** Went positive on June 1st, and it looks like in the past 10 cases that this has happened, there was a continued upwards trend in the stock price. \n-\t**Momentum:** Like BRK.B, this has seen an upwards trend in momentum since the end of May. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**BAC**\n\n-\t**Aroon:** Downward trend here is a bit more significant, with a good number of previous cases doing a good job at predicting continued downward movement. \n-\t**MACD:** Went positive around the time of the other two (most of XLF\u2019s holdings to be exact). Like the previous two, continued growth was seen in similar occurrences. \n-\t**Momentum:** Went above 0 around the same time as the previous two and did a pretty good job at predicting further upwards movement. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow for the main overall analysis: \n\n**XLF**\n\n-\t**Aroon:** Upward trend on Friday and this was very telling with previous cases regarding continued upward movement. \n-\t**MACD:** Friday\u2019s closed showed a very strong upwards trend since the end of May. There has been an upwards trend in this since 5/22.\n-\t**Momentum:** It closed on Friday with a very good upwards trend. There is some strong correlation here between positivity and continued movement upwards.\n\n**TL;DR:** Even if you don\u2019t believe in TA there is still something to be had from the financial sector and instead of betting on any one bank just go all-in on the ETF that tracks all of them. The reopening is going to be BIG. **Positions:** 6/12/20 $29 calls, 6/19/20 29.5 calls, and 6/26/20 $30 calls.", "created_utc": 1591568537.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gym1ou/x_gon_give_it_to_ya_a_case_for_xlf/", "is_self": true}
