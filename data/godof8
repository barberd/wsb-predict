Fundamentally the company met, beat, and beat earnings the past three quarters respectively. This is a great sign that during corona season HHC has done well.\n\nHHC is a real estate company, one of the largest markets in the US, and something that always gets a seasonal boost from the summer, as more people are buying/moving into homes. Real Estate as a sector, as most sectors will, get a great boost from the country opening back up, as it seems that is the way things are trending. With the stimulus packages and things opening back up, expect a lot of pockets to open up, the economy to get flowing, and for markets to rise. All benefitial for real estate and by association HHC. \n\nHHC specifically has properties in the seaport district of NYC, in Honolulu, Vegas, New Orleans, Chicago, and others. Specilizing in larger apartment style buildings. This style means they were more suseptable to the situation at hand, but also means they stand to gain significantly when things open back up. With more people traveling to the larger cities, and more people ready to commit to living in their new apartment or purchasing a place to live in a big city for work etc, more money will flow in. Buying/renting an apartment is just not something people want to think about right now, but will become really important for people to figure out come the end of quarantine.\n\nMost importantly is that the stock is valued at around 50$ and before corona the stock sat at 110+. Look for this to make a big move upwards as things start opening back up. Target price is around 100$. An easy rule is target price- strike price>2\\*premium = the options is \"cheap\" relatively speaking. The double bottom also played out over 2/2.5 months, and being able to get options dated more than twice the time of the pattern is also considered \"good\", again its all relative, but looking on the chain for HHC there are a lot of undervalued plays that should pay out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR 10/16 80$ call.", "created_utc": 1590126936.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/godof8/howard_hughes_corporation_dd/", "is_self": true}
