Some offset by Pension buying **~$40-45bn in equities to buy over the next week (and like the above half in US / half outside US)** \u2013 but in this environment **not all of this likely trades** (i.e. pensions won\u2019t go all the way back to target weights). \n\nSystematic supply is an overhang, but not the most important dynamic right now \u2013 **the initial shock has come,** and people understand (have priced) a lot of this now. The bigger swing factor is what discretionary managers do. **HFs have been buyers of stock all week \u2013 and that is not working.** How long can they hold those positions? **Appetite to hold risk over the weekend will likely be limited** (given length of time + China PMIs). \n\n**The bounce we expected happened yesterday and it failed to hold, and we remain cautious for the next few days.**", "created_utc": 1582823451, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/faf9iz/cta_supply_rebalance_demand_and_the_joker_is_what/", "is_self": true}
