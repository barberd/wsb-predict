Iranian general(s) bought Raytheon and Lockhead calls before launching the missiles in which case they would be acting on insider information!!! I really don't know what the SEC is doing just chilling in Washington when there are real white collar criminals in Iran taking OUR tendies immorally, and most importantly, unfairly! But then again maybe its not insider information and all the analysts knew it would happen and this missile strike is already priced into the stock price. Anyways I just hate it when white-collar criminals like Iran get away scot free, we really need to be deploying the SEC to Iran, dress shoes on the ground.", "created_utc": 1578456141, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/elnc31/why_isnt_the_sec_investigating_iran_for_insider/", "is_self": true}
