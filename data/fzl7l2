Up ~$5,500 & found out I\u2019m strangling wrong. Halp. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n66upkylt9s41.png?width=1524&format=png&auto=webp&s=f600addf1b94ab969bc7bfcc9e7def22c98876d4\n\nSince early March or so I've been lurking & commenting with some regularity in the pinned daily threads. My first deposit on Robinhood (I know) was around 3/10 & I happened to see the Bloomberg (I know) WSB cover piece. Immediately came here and made my first options trade a couple days later. Gradually deposited $2,142.17 between the two accounts shown and after a few lucky trades I withdrew $1,891 back to my bank account and the rest is shown here.\n\nAs you can see, I got pretty lucky with some ARMK & PENN puts out of the gate and then went a bit overboard with CCL while still attempting to get the hang of how to even execute options trades. I rode $10 LEVI puts on the way down from around $12 or $13 on that Monday & sold when it reached $9.50 or so the following Friday, immediately took $100 of that and bought $12 LEVI calls which worked out early the next week.\n\nI've found that I really was strangling (I think) a lot of the options, casting way too wide of a net and though I'm still a fucking idiot/really new at this, I feel I'm sort of playing with house money since nearly all of what I have in these accounts is profit. That being said, I continue to play cheap OTM calls or puts, usually no more than a week out (I know, not smart - but I don't care).\n\n**My question**: Why would anyone *actually* strangle, say, LEVI by purchasing ten 4/17 $15calls & 4/17 $12 puts ($.23 & $.10, respectively x10 = $330) when you can purchase ten 4/17 $15 calls for $250 ***and*** ten 4/17 $12 puts for $100? In this specific instance, I understand the \"correct\" way to strangle averages these LEVI calls down to $.23 instead of $.25, but there are plenty of instances where the prices would be the exact same yet you'd be settling for ten strangle options instead of 20 options, ten each way. I've not once bought the actual strangle where you select both plays at once. \n\n**Am I losing out on money doing it the autistic way? What am I missing?**", "created_utc": 1586646738.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fzl7l2/alright_been_here_a_month_first_postgains/", "is_self": true}
