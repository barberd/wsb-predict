I got into $INO early with $5c, however this stock shot up to $19 and is currently trading at $9.64 because of a fund artist tweet. CEO publicly came out and defamed the tweet and the stock went back up, slightly. There is much further upside for this stock...the momentum was huge and CV isn\u2019t slowing down. \n\nBullish:\n\n1.Has vaccine ready for human trials next month. \n\n2.CEO was at White House meeting and talked with Trump ($8b package expected to be split to them). \n\n3. BBC just did a short documentary with them and talked about the vaccine. \n\n4.Funded $9 million by William Gates last month for research.\n\n5.Volume is huge and has shaken out a lot of noobs. \n\nRide the hype train and let the tenders simmer. \n\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/av/embed/p081rvhm/51665497\n\nhttps://mobile.twitter.com/inoviopharma\n\nCEPI tweeted they are working with $INO to develop the vaccine - https://mobile.twitter.com/inoviopharma?lang=en\n\nTL;DR $INO might be a huge upside CV vaccine stock.
