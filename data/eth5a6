{"id": "eth5a6", "title": "My detailed analysis of why I am shorting Tesla", "selftext": "Disclaimer: this is not investment advice. I could be very wrong about everything said here do your own research.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started shorting Tesla about a year ago when I learned of their plan to completely skip production testing and go straight to ramp. Coming from an engineering background I knew how badly this would turn out and I\u2019m convinced they\u2019ve wasted millions of dollars (maybe billions) ramping up flawed designs (ex 14% first pass yields or scrapping tons of automation capex because they couldn\u2019t get it to work). No matter what crazy shit went down over the past year I always remembered my original short thesis. Because they didn\u2019t test the car and production first, they will need to continue wasting capital on low yields, and then reworks, and then warranty repairs, and then recalls. By the end there is almost no chance they will ever get positive gross margins out of this car.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore recently however a new thesis has appeared for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI used to not believe in the analogy of Theranos to Tesla. Theranos was a fraud because they never had a working product and advertised they did. But with Tesla, their cars are real and tons of people buy and love them. Maybe they have unrealistic targets but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they committed fraud. Recent developments have changed my mind though. I now believe \u201cfull self driving\u201d is Tesla\u2019s biggest and most obvious fraud, and it will bring down the company similar to how Theranos was brought down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTesla has been advertising FSD for years as being just around the corner. They advertised the feature on their website as \u201cpending regulatory approval\u201d as if the only thing stopping them from releasing it is the government. If you watch the Model 3 reveal from 2 years ago Elon basically says they have it ready to go. We know now that was a lie because it is now 2 years later and it still doesn\u2019t exist. The combination of the following have made me almost 100% certain that Tesla has been bullshitting everyone this whole time:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen Elon said if the cars needed a new computer to have FSD, it would be a free upgrade. This was the first time he publicly backtracked on the claim that all cars are FSD ready.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen Elon announced a new Tesla chip that would be ready in 6 months and be a free upgrade. Building chips is extremely complex and requires tons of testing and iteration to get it right. If they take the Model 3 approach to building their chip, I guarantee it won\u2019t work and they will waste a bunch of capital trying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe lack of FSD demos since the original one. We later learned the original one was completely staged.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe recent delay of their on-ramp to offramp mode. If they don\u2019t have this ready now how are they close to any real self driving.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, when they removed FSD from their order page. There is no reason for them to remove the option especially since they need the money now more than ever. Unless they suddenly decided it\u2019s not a good idea to charge people for something that doesn\u2019t exist. More likely a regulator poked them about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf FSD is revealed as fake it will be massively devastating. Tesla directly took money from customers which makes it super easy to show that they profited off the charade. I think investors will soon realize that they\u2019ve been lied to and Tesla will go down for fraud just like Theranos did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: I\u2019m short TSLA initially because they didn\u2019t test the Model 3 before releasing it, and now because I think they committed straight fraud by lying about having full self driving almost ready.", "created_utc": 1579902308, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eth5a6/my_detailed_analysis_of_why_i_am_shorting_tesla/", "is_self": true}
