{"id": "f6cq05", "title": "Rollover IRA Questions", "selftext": "Hi,   \n\n\nLooking for advice, as I am not good with stocks or care much. My last job let me go and my 401k went into a \"rollover IRA\". Not much in it, $1600, but I am young and willing to invest this in stock.   \n\n\nMy questions:   \n\n\n1. I read ETF is the safe route to go, im down to do this, but which would y'all suggest in investing into? (I am taking everything by a grain of salt).\n2. Being young, would investing it in something like SPCE be more beneficial?   \n\n3. invest half in ETF and half in something more risky?   \n\n\nJust looking for ideas since y'all seem to know your shit (some of you at least).  \n\n\nThanks!", "created_utc": 1582128097, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6cq05/rollover_ira_questions/", "is_self": true}
