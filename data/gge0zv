Then I gave it all back on the way up. Retarded. Should have bot calls. \n\n1. we all know this situation is ridiculous and it's going to crack to under 450 again (let's just say hit the 200MA, or dip below); \n\n2. How to know when it's going to happen (right before it is)?\n\n3. How to make the most money off it on the way down? \na. When you think it's cracking just buy puts outright, maybe .3 delta 60DTE (expensive!!) and hold to expiry;\nb. sell call verticals again and again just otm or even itm, 30DTE, and close them as they lose value and open new ones;\nc. buy put verticals, again big questions about hold to expiry, dte, etc. \n\nThe *assumption* here is that when it moves it will move down 50% within a month or two. It's done that both on the way up, down, up, down, and again. It's going to have to make that trip back down, and when it does I want to get my money back - and more.\n\nLike every good wsb autist I want to turn $10k I can't afford to lose into $100k in a week or two. Nothing means anything in 2020 so it's all possible. This is a giant piece of crap that is going to print rubbish Q2 numbers, and it is only this high due to insane speculation creating call convexity vortexes and blah. It's going to collapse.
