{"id": "gvwxvt", "title": "REIT DD: I warned Ya'll previously that you shouldn't be ignoring Big Mall Stocks. Now they Soar once again even higher than before!", "selftext": "A lot of people **STILL CONTINUE TO** write off Malls/Centers even after the previous thread I made showing the bumps. It's not too late to jump in, if you don't you are making a grave mistake if you think this is a write-off sector like most foolish and Robinhood-level investors.\n\nHere are  tickers as of 12PM EST of big mall stocks and their performance:\n\n**$SPG: up 14.7%!**\n\n**$SITC: up 14.66%!**\n\n**$MAC: up 12.7%!**\n\n**$KRG: up 11.94%**\n\n**$KIM: up 10.78%**\n\n**$SKT: up 10.33%!**\n\n**$REG: up 8.43%!**\n\n**The top 7 mall holding companies in America are now soaring bigger** than ever before for the following reasons, and we are now entering the recovery phase so you are running out of time.\n\n1. Among the top 7 mall holding companies, several of them have partnered up to collude on ventures to raise capital and more partnerships are on the way. Meaning that they are supporting amongst themselves.\n2. As other mall holding companies are worth pennies or nearing shutdown **the top 7 are buying up or attempting to close deals on buying up many of the smaller mall holding companies.**  One example is that Taubman's deal with Simon Property is still in the green, and Simon will continue with the buyout. Mac is about to buy many smaller internet companies for their retail brandbox idea.\n3. This delusion that ***people will be \"scared\" to go to malls is now (confirmed) bullshit.*** As people have been waiting in line to go to stores inside the bigger malls and have been gradually increasing in traffic for smaller once. Many bigger malls are also places to \"hang-out\" and malls being among the first shopping centers top open, will have the advantage on being a \"hang-out spot\" as other \"public places\" still remain closed in many cities across the country.\n4. Many of the top 7 indoor and outdoor mall/shopping center holders **CONTINUE TO SEE jumps just on announcements of potentially opening up MORE locations across several states.** Hopium is a real drug and it will continue to raise the stock prices of major malls.\n5. Mall tenants are working with malls to expand advertising to get crowds to the malls as much as possible to make up losses and it's working!\n6. Many people need haircuts, new shoes, clothes, suits, entertainment to distract them like games, movies, soundbars, headphones, etc. **The malls will be the FIRST in line to offer every day distractions and essentials** to the people, since the top 7 mall holding companies are ***going to open before many of your street strips will***. While also having social interaction, and a closed (or open if it's outdoor) space to \"hang out\" in and \"relax\", and that's important.\n\nBy betting against the malls you are basically doing the same as putting in $200 puts on Chipotle or $800 calls on Luckin Coffee. AKA, that ***Doesn't make ANY sense.***\n\nMalls have cheap premiums for calls (for now) and aren't usually volatile once things become balanced (SPG being a common exception) so if you want to get in on the Big Mall Victory Shaped recovery you are running out of time because a lot of the recovery will be done by the end of this month.\n\n***Jump in on big malls now!***\n\nMAC $10C, KITE $13C, SKT $9C, REG $51C,  SPG $82C.", "created_utc": 1591201109.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gvwxvt/reit_dd_i_warned_yall_previously_that_you/", "is_self": true}
