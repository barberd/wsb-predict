{"id": "e4n3n4", "title": "Unemployed mid-20 yr old needs stock tips", "selftext": "Have about $100k saved up and want a &gt;=10-bagger (open to option trades) opportunity. \n\nPreferred criteria:\n\n1. &lt;=$500m market cap/enterprise value\n\n2. Double-digit FCF yield - or pro-forma DD FCF yield adjusted for temporary performance blips (abnormal working capital changes, etc.)\n\n3. Conservative capital structure, or a potential pathway to a conservative capital structure\n\n4. Significant underperformance caused by technical dislocations (large shareholder liquidating, etc.)\n\n5. Market leader in a niche industry with strong barriers to entry\n\n6. Significant insider ownership shareholder-aligned compensation structure\n\n7. Change in capital allocation strategy (for example, HOME management recently changed capital allocation strategy from expanding store count and spending $$$$ on growth capex, to cutting back on growth capex to generate positive FCF)\n\n8. Also open to short ideas, although they must have decent liquidity and a very loose float. Bonus points for catalysts and overleveraged roll-ups with options trading at low implied volatilities\n\nThank you,\n\nMikhail Burry", "created_utc": 1575231899, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e4n3n4/unemployed_mid20_yr_old_needs_stock_tips/", "is_self": true}
