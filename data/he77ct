Tl;dr, a stocks price will typically see an increase in value and volume after being added to the Russell index, and see long term gains as it remains in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe doc above is designed to where you can sort the stocks alphabetically, or sort by sector and/or price. I have included the volume for all stocks as a reference of how actively it is traded.

Find a stock you recognize or focus on a sector that you want to add to your portfolio and go crazy. I will not tell you to buy calls or puts based on a stocks inclusion or deletion from the index, but wanted to just make you aware of this annual event.
