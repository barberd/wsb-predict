{"id": "dlzv7f", "title": "BA Put Holder Support and Education Thread", "selftext": "Hey guys, how ya doing?  Just wanted to check in, I don't have any trades in Boeing (bc I'm autistic but not retarded).  How you guys holding up?  Perhaps you're thinking, \"OMG THEY MISSED REVENUES BY 53% SO HOW THE FUCK ARE THEY UP 3.5% THIS MORNING???? AHHHHHH!!!\"  As with my other posts... the National Suicide Hotline Prevention number is: 1-800-273-8255 and is available 24/7.  \n\n\n**TL;DR: Don't get bet against Boeing bc there are too many major players with huge amounts of interest in supporting the stock.**  \n\n\nSo here's some education for you on why you should never bet against Boeing and INSTEAD should go long EVERY time it hits the $300 - $320 range.    \n1) The chart: Go look at a two year daily chart for BA.  EVERY time it's hit this range it proceeds to catch an uptick of around $20 - 40 dollars.  EVEN IN Q4 2018 BA DIPPED BELOW $300 FOR ALL OF TWO DAYS.    \n\n\n2) There are basically two makers of commercial aircraft in the world: Boeing and Airbus.  The lower Boeing stock goes the more likely it is that Airbus (a competitor that the US government openly has said it does not want to give up an inch to) takes away market share from Boeing.  Therefore, BA has a synthetic floor underneath it.  \n\n\n3) If you are operating under the assumption that we live in a free market that is based off of fundamentals then you have gone full retard and you never go full retard.  It is in US interests to make sure that Boeing stock stays strong, or perhaps a better way to phrase it, does not weaken beyond a certain point.  When the stock does weak to a certain point you'll start to see talking points coming out of the FAA or BA about how they think they're close to getting the 737 MAX back in service.  \n\n\n4) Fund managers are actively aware that this stock will be stuck in a trading range until the 737 MAX shit clears up.  Therefore, they are selling every top and buying every bottom.  So, EVERY time Boeing climbs up you can count on a big sell off from bad news, however, that sell off is only going to go to a certain point (see point #1) bc at that $300ish level algos gonna step back in and start buying again.  Why?  Bc, referring to point #2, if you want to invest in aircraft manufacturing you don't have a ton of options.", "created_utc": 1571839857, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dlzv7f/ba_put_holder_support_and_education_thread/", "is_self": true}
