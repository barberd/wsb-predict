I've never seen a stock so manipulated. Like, TA is a bunch of voodoo with magic lines and shit but you dont need TA to see this. Literally shot up to 13.5, then next 5 days are 13, 12.5, 12, 12.5, 12.25, 12, now looks like 11.5 for today. Down to 11.4 but if it finishes at 11.5 pattern continues.\n\n&gt; Not sure wtf that means, big money keeping price low so they can accumulate before earnings? Or keeping price at certain levels so they can sell off gains from the run up from 8.73-&gt;13.5? was considering calls for earnings because it looked like it had retard strength before this week of manipulation, but not sure what is going on here. \n\nFor a while there it looked like SDC might might break the pattern as it was down to 11.34, but now its back up to 11.5 as of this post. \n\nThis thing IPOed at 20+, which was overvalued, but this price action leading up to its first earnings on 11/12 seems really funky to me. IV on 11/15 options is pretty high and there is 20k OI on the 10c and 15c. Going to be a huge move either way but seems like the price is getting suppressed?", "created_utc": 1573244738, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dtl8qh/dd_weird_smiledirectclub_sdc_price_manipulation/", "is_self": true}
