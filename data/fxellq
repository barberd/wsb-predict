Letting the rest ride into tomorrow. Bag holding 4/17 220 like a dumb bitch still I aint selling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStarted trading options at the very beginning of the crash. My complete ignorance of risk tolerance is the only reason I got here. Not knowing what I was doing and the gravity of the situation allowed me to YOLO every single gains I had into more and more SPY puts. I reached around 595k when we hit 218 and got out. Thought I was fucking smart waiting to buy back in at 244... Hard lessons learned but I got back any losses I had and more today topping out at 620k.\n\nAlso: I still dont know what a spread is stop fucking telling me to start doing spreads.
