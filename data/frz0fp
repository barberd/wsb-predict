One sec let me reply.\n\n\nedit 2: This is the email they sent me:\n\nI have just been notified that you have posted information from our private discussions on Reddit.  These discussions were confidential and constituted good faith attempt to resolve your complaint. Your Reddit posts are inaccurate, misleading and contain defamatory content. As we discussed, you incurred a loss as a result of trading in high risk options, which you failed to mention in your posts.\n\nWe ask that you remove these posts immediately and you cease to use social media to post defamatory and misleading statements about Questrade in an attempt to extort funds from the company. If you do not remove these posts, you are put on notice that this will become a legal matter. Our legal department are already investigating two prior posts you made where you stated that you were ready to \"burn down the building\" as well as making the following statement: \u201c if I can\u2019t get my money back I\u2019ll be sure they lose an equal amount in whatever way I can.'' \n\nIf we do not receive your confirmation by 12pm on March 31, 2020, that you will discontinue posting defamatory content on social media, you will leave us no choice than to commence legal action. \n\nTo keep things in perspective, the world is reeling from a tragic situation.  Thousands of people have lost their lives.  Our staff have been working around the clock to help our clients get through this unprecedented crisis.  In response to our genuine attempts to find an amicable solution, you have threatened and insulted our staff.  I urge you to think about your actions.\n\n__________________________________________________________\nI replied that I'll go through all my posts and comments and edit any lies I may have said unintentionally. But just to clarify guys the position that I held was 0DTE options purchased day of. This is obviously a high risk position. Options in general are. If I had purchased and ETF or stock then I obviously would not have incurred such a loss. I just want to make that clear. \n\n__________________________________________________________\n\nI had a 0 DTE options position worth $50000 CAD that I opened that day. My broker (Questrade) had serious outages for hours that day (and for 3 days in the previous week) leaving many clients unable to access their positions. \n\nMy position expired worthless and I was obviously very upset that I couldn't access such a volatile position for multiple hours. \n\nI wrote to their compliance department while also commenting everywhere on their sub warning clients and potential not to trade with Questrade because of this. The previous week after losing $10000 from a similar issue I asked a CS rep for $200 in compensation (the commissions from that day) and they refused.\n\nAfter I made such a scene on the questrade subreddit the mod reached out to me to have someone call me to discuss my issues. \n\nAfter a phone call and a short email chain he requested I delete all my negative comments because there was clearly a \"bias\" being shown. \n\nI complied in order to see what their compensation offer would be. \n\nTheir offer? $1200 USD.\n\nMy commissions for the past month plus $350.\n\n\nIn addition I would have to sign an NDA\n\nHere's the relevant part:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/q0vGiw0\n\n\n\nThe Releasor(s) further agree(s) to do the following:\n\na)\timmediately refrain from making or posting negative comments about Questrade; and\n\nb)\twithin two (2) days of executing the Release, remove all negative comments made on internet websites, including but not limited to blogs and to social media such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter (collectively referred to as \u201cSocial Media\u201d), about the Releasee, to the satisfaction of the Releasee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat a fucking joke. \n\n\nI am still waiting to hear back from compliance but I'm not holding my breath for a real offer. \n\nMaybe this gives all you guys who got ruined from Robinhood's outages some hope. Maybe you can get back all your Robinhood commissions. \n\nOn a serious note though, if you were affected by Questrade's incompetence over the last few weeks check out my profile. I've made a small guide on how you can formally submit a complaint and get some kind of compensation. I'm sure for some of you the few hundred dollars is worth it. But even if not I've included steps you can take to potentially get a better offer through the ombudsman for banking. \n\nBest of luck.", "created_utc": 1585601543.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frz0fp/my_broker_questrade_wants_me_to_sign_an_nda/", "is_self": true}
