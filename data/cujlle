THE TENDIES WERE DELICIOUS TODAY.", "selftext": "After the Orange Baby thumb-fucked our country on Twitter today, my puts went greener than the lush countryside of Ireland. In celebration, I meandered to a local establishment called \u201cTight Ends\u201d where I assure you, the name of the restaurant does NOT make reference to a certain football player position. Nay, at this establishment, the serving wenches wear lingerie, and their TIGHT ENDS are on display for all to see (and likely masturbate to later).\n\nGentlemen, the chicken tendies I consumed at this establishment were extra crispy, and extra tender today. A consummate victory on an already victorious and glorious day. \n\nAll hail our Orange Baby-in-Chief, for he is the provider of tendies.", "created_utc": 1566592857, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cujlle/gentlemen_the_tendies_were_delicious_today/", "is_self": true}
