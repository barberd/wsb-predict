The initial response was great, and I thank all of you for the support. If you haven't read the first post, I recommend reviewing it as this post (and future posts) will build off of that foundation.\n\n(As a reminder, this is not investment advice. The results of this research should not be generalized over thousands of weeks of earnings releases. Proceed at your own risk.)\n\nSince my previous post, I've retroactively applied our methodology to the previous 5 weeks of earnings, considered a more conservative investment methodology, and discovered some interesting insights in the process.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst and foremost, backtesting has provided increasing evidence that this methodology is a secure hedge against market downturns. The results from 4/13 to 5/11 are below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Week of 4/13 to 4/17**\n\n|Earnings Return|S&P Return|DOW Return|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|2.30%|3.98%|3.60%|\n||||\n|Outperform (underperform):|\\-1.49%||\n\n\\-The week of 4/13 was made up primarily of financial institutions earnings which may explain the smaller movement. More on this later.\n\n[Link to spreadsheet with specific day to day breakdowns.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NNFycx04rJ5lNG7F7dx-aN9BhH-emVZRwI2n2H4hQNA/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Week of 4/20 to 4/24**\n\n|Earnings Return|S&P Return|DOW Return|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|0.35%|0.50%|0.50%|\n||||\n|Outperform (underperform):|\\-0.15%||\n\n[Link to spreadsheet with specific day to day breakdowns.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KH-o60KYGdpVgE8wGpCt2B98MNy-oK4feDR9ztVptn4/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Week of 4/27 to 5/1**\n\n|Earnings Return|S&P Return|DOW Return|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|0.01%|\\-1.50%|\\-1.70%|\n||||\n|Outperform (underperform):|1.61%||\n\n\\-As a general trend (which will be discussed in-depth later on), it is usually more speculative + growth stocks that drive earnings returns each week. Companies that would fall under the Graham-Dodd \"value-investment\" definition usually have smaller movements following earnings in both directions. The week of 4/27 demonstrated the necessity of including more speculative earnings plays to outperform the market, as without these plays, our earnings returns would've underperformed.\n\n[Link to spreadsheet with specific day to day breakdowns.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IpNM_XrVQOUHNgh8mT4RWTIH_E9V8JYt7jIDvhHrogg/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Week of 5/4 to 5/8**\n\n|Earnings Return|S&P Return|DOW Return|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|3.58%|3.12%|2.56%|\n||||\n|Outperform (underperform):|0.69%||\n\n\\-Earnings were predominantly growth/tech stocks.\n\n[Link to spreadsheet with specific day to day breakdowns.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18BF6iiIb13jEjFip3LCso2Y4fS-diga6XSgWY3cg_JM/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Week of 5/11 to 5/15**\n\n|Earnings Return|S&P Return|DOW Return|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|2.40%|\\-1.50%|\\-2.30%|\n||||\n|Outperform (underperform):|4.30%||\n\n\\-Earnings were predominantly growth/tech stocks.\n\n\\-This was the greatest earnings performance (versus the market) over the last 5 weeks. Although a preliminary look at earnings returns this week + market performance points to a similar, if not greater earnings outperformance this week.\n\n[Link to spreadsheet with specific day to day breakdowns.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Tf_sJnfaUoNmYeRnRKtBu2xJuBKio5xzOJV-0d_X5dg/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Summary**\n\n||Earnings Return Week to Week|S&P Return Week to Week|DOW Return Week to Week|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|4/13|2.30%|3.98%|3.60%|\n|4/20|0.35%|0.50%|0.50%|\n|4/27|0.01%|\\-1.50%|\\-1.70%|\n|5/4|3.58%|3.12%|2.56%|\n|5/11|2.40%|\\-1.50%|\\-2.30%|\n|||||\n|Total Compounded Return ($100)|$108.89|$104.55|$102.55|\n\n**A few key points:**\n\n\\-Similar to 5/11, each week, there were more negative movements following earnings than positive movements, but on average, the positive movements were greater. This supports the thesis that the upside of a positive earnings response is greater than the downside of a negative earnings response.\n\n\\-Despite the fact the earnings return underperformed the broader market 2 of the 5 weeks (4/13 + 4/20), the earnings returns were never negative (albeit it got close 4/27). This supports the thesis that the optimism surrounding companies' earnings acts as a hedge against broader market unfavorability.\n\n\\-As was brought to my attention in my last post, because the holding period for each stock is no more than 24 hours, in future posts total earnings returns will need to be discounted for capital gains taxes. This demonstrates the advantage of passive indexing + not having to worry about often turnover. I believe that even considering capital gains, the earnings results of the last 5 weeks will still outperform the broader markets, but we will see in the next post.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Applying Our Methodology to Low-Beta Companies + Going Forward**\n\nThe last few weeks of research have led me to believe that putting together a formal investment vehicle for this methodology, such as an ETF, would be difficult considering the lack of upside potential residing in fundamentally proven companies. ETFs that focus on trading within the S&P or DOW are inherently disadvantaged from a return perspective. But I would argue that under the right portfolio formation (following the diversified earnings schedule we've followed the last 5 weeks), we can sustain an outperformance of the broader market over the long term.\n\nTo demonstrate this, I will apply this methodology to the current 505 companies in the S&P, going from 2008 to 2019. This will be the subject matter of my next post (along with continued backtesting on the \"most anticipated earnings\" investment approach). In anticipation of conducting this research, I chose $WYNN (which has been in the S&P since 2008) to experiment with returns. As the results show (fair warning, this is 1 of 505 companies. extrapolating from this is ignorant on my part), there is legitimacy to the argument that attempting to apply this earnings report methodology to low-beta companies will NOT outperform the market.\n\n**$WYNN Returns (10/29/08 to 5/9/19)**\n\n||Earnings|S&P|DOW|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Return|123.60% (not including capital gains)|213.55%|176.98%|\n|Annualized Return|11.18%|||\n|Average Earnings Movement|1.796%|||\n\n[Link to spreadsheet with specific day to day breakdowns.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ikkxjrtz0wXacKfyPvIPcHQ0LihCkJv-nu1Q1s-2Yos/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs a preliminary test, this reflects poorly on the potential of applying this methodology to the S&P and DOW. It very well may be that $WYNN is an exception: we will see next week.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOverall, a lot of the information discovered so far is a generous extrapolation. But we are objectively getting closer to clear answers regarding how this methodology may perform over the long-term. Over the next few weeks, we will be working on filling in the S&P's returns from '08 to '19 using this methodology, along with applying this methodology to \"anticipated earnings releases\" over an extended period of time as we've done for the last five weeks.\n\nAs always, please let me know what you think!", "created_utc": 1590103995.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/go7y81/playing_the_earnings_calendar_an_analysis_of/", "is_self": true}
