This is partially due to the announcement that NVAX is working on a coronavirus vaccine with human testing starting in the spring. But that\u2019s not all folks, this glorious pharma has also been long working on a flu vaccine called nanoflu that is on its last phase of trials with results looking good to date and final results coming sometime in March. If that vaccine passes its last trials as expected, NVAX is gonna commercialize it and the stock price is going to the moon and you don\u2019t wanna miss the launch. \n\ntldr 3/20 or 3/27 call at $15 strike price or whatever you want, it\u2019s going up up up act fast", "created_utc": 1582917651, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fb00ca/nvax_tendies/", "is_self": true}
