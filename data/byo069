Dow had its largest one week gain of 2019 after FED alluded to the fact, they may consider cutting interest rates. Obviously, the punch in the dick was Trumps announcement of tariffs on Mexico the day after I created the post above. While we are now well above those levels and even appear to have a trade deal with them now, it was not very fun holding calls that day. Ended up rolling them out so Theta didn\u2019t fuck me over. \n\nI ended up selling to early on Thursday, but the Friday jobs number could have gone either way so I decided to get out. I am now net delta negative after opening some positions Friday, more on that latter. I appreciate the support the last post got along with people sending me pictures of their returns, was cool to be able to help some people out.\n\nOn to this week\n\nI\u2019ll start off by saying this won\u2019t be the same type of post I made last week as well as it may be considerably longer. Focusing more on the model I use, if that doesn\u2019t float your boat, you don\u2019t have to read this, or do and shit post below. Either one works for me. \n\nThe data\n\n1. I\u2019ll skip the SKEW index for now. It has increased since my last post but day to day it is not a particularly helpful indicator. \n\n2. [https://imgur.com/a/nTjPATV](https://imgur.com/a/nTjPATV) The 10 period moving average of the VIX call put ratio has increased a fair amount since my last post indicating there are increasingly more long bets on the VIX over the course of this rally. I will also add that the VIX has held up surprisingly well the past week, indicating the larger insinuations and traders that trade SPX options are buying more downside protection even with this rally. **Whenever VIX and SPX have a positive correlation, it generally is not a good sign**.\n\n3. [https://imgur.com/a/qUJX49s](https://imgur.com/a/qUJX49s) The DIX has fallen slightly over this rally, nothing to shocking though and is still fairly high. Something that does concern me is the GEX. The GEX is a measure of market makers hedging obligations and the sharp rise over the past week looks somewhat similar to that of May 16 2019, and Nov 7 2018. Not an ideal time to buy after the GEX spikes. For more info see [https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/docs](https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/docs)\n\n4. From a TA perspective, a **pull back to start the week is by far the most likely outcome**. For SPY QQQ and IWM, there is bearish divergence on the PPO and Momentum and the Slow stochastic is about to cross below 80 on the 30 min chart. The hourly tell similar storied but the Slow Stochastic is slightly farther from 80. Look for this to stick below 80 as a sign the short-term trend has changed. [https://imgur.com/a/9g9M9ru](https://imgur.com/a/9g9M9ru)\n\nThe model\n\nI have made some significant changes to the model I use. I decided to go from using inputs based solely off of the close of SPY, to using a **broader array of inputs such as oil prices and treasury yields** as well as I ramped up the number of Epochs used. Unfortunately, I have decided to keep the exact data/input structure I used private for my own reasons, mainly because I feel as if it is my secret sauce. I\u2019ve spent quite a bit of time working on it and making the methods more well-known doesn\u2019t exactly do me any favors. That being said, if you have any questions/criticisms regarding the model, please look at my older posts before asking them and I may or may not answer them. \n\nHere are the back test for the past ten weeks [https://imgur.com/a/ceuKDCr](https://imgur.com/a/ceuKDCr), sorry for the formatting, I didn\u2019t feel like making each one its own picture. An important note, is that I switched from having the forecast and SPY having separate axis, to having a **shared y-axis using a percentage change from t=0**. One reason I think I missed timed my long entry last week is that I was using a relative scale. \n\nIf I had used the % scale, I would have seen that the model was predicting a 4% downside to start off the period, but SPY had only fell 1.5% when I was looking to go long. Hindsight is 20/20 I guess. The only back test that did not turn out so good was the one starting 3/27. While SPY did finish that period with a slight pull back, the model predicted a much more significant down turn which we did not see. \n\nHere is the sum off the back tests along with the forecast for the next two weeks: [https://imgur.com/a/3AUFoe1](https://imgur.com/a/3AUFoe1). I went with the dual axis as over a long period time using a percentage method separate the graphs so that they are not as easy to compare, seeing as they are 20 day forecasts I think that this makes the most sense over a long period of time. **The correlation between the forecasts and SPY is .305**. Not perfect but doesn\u2019t appear to be random. I will have to get a larger sample size to confirm this latter. \n\nHere is the forecast on a % terms: [https://imgur.com/a/Ixzn0eQ](https://imgur.com/a/Ixzn0eQ). I will be looking for a pull back early this weak to enter long positions and close my 6/14 call credit spreads, **looking for about 284-285 on SPY**. From my back tests it is clear that some movements are exaggerated and often don\u2019t occur exactly on the predicted day, so I think it is safe to say you should not expect a 4% drop Monday. You\u2019ll have to use some other data point to confirm a near term bottom.\n\nLooking at the forecast together with the data, I will be playing call credit spreads, continuing to hold my SPY, V, and ROKU call credit spreads I opened Friday, and looking to get into ITM call debt spreads late this week. I will add that holding naked calls in this environment does not offer a favorable risk to reward ratio. ITM debt spreads will be my preferred strategy until the trade/economic outlook is clearer. Especially sense the Mexico trade news came out after hours Friday, I have no idea how the futures will react.\n\nAs always, ***This Is Not Advice To Buy Or Sell Any Security*** and you need to do your own research to come to your own conclusions. This is just a summary of the data I am looking at along with my plan for the next two weeks, which is subject to change without updating everyone who reads this.", "created_utc": 1560108426, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/byo069/part_2/", "is_self": true}
