A recent 200-for-1 reverse split to keep from being delisted and force a bankruptcy was met with an absolutely huge sell off. My former employer banned all work with them mid last year due to fears of not getting paid. They\u2019ve been spiraling for quite awhile. \n\nI\u2019d love to short them into oblivion or take advantage of the downfall through puts, but I\u2019m not familiar enough with the put side of options to really play it right. Looking at the 2021 or 2022 expirations, not sure what to do from there. There\u2019s a good chance they hit BK before the end of the year, but it could be the first half of next year at worst. \n\nThey will go bankrupt though. This has been a long time coming. \n\nFor those of you familiar with put strategies, what\u2019s the best play we could all make on them?", "created_utc": 1587143022.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g35zgu/chk_is_done_for_thoughts/", "is_self": true}
