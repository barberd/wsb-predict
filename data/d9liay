I\u2019ve only been a member here for about a month and just started trading options but holy fuck, I feel like I would make more money buying scratch offs.\n\nI\u2019m not making uneducated plays, I had some GE calls bought before yesterday because it was bouncing hard off of a $9 support. But yet today it completely loses all of its momentum and is back where it started when I bought. Now theta decay is raping my ass.\n\nI know no one knows how the market will go, but I see a fuck ton of people on here saying it doesn\u2019t make sense either. \n\nMy butthole hurts.
