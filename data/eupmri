If you're unaware Chinese New Year is a FUCKING 40 DAY HOLIDAY, they use to drink fermented eel piss and set off fireworks all over the fucking place. I'm sure it's hilarious to watch, but it's a huge pain in the ass for anyone that has to deal with them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBottom line, these motherfuckers weren't going to be making your truck stop boner pills so you could stay hard long enough to pay one of the toothless lot lizards you passed walking in to let you fuck her in the ass anyway... This shit was happening regardless, so before you Doogie Howser the shit out of the Coronavirus, just know that finding a cure is fucking pointless. Everyone there has it and clearly the only cure is 40 days and nights getting shitfaced on fermented eel piss, and shooting bottle rockets out of your ass. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not saying it the SPY doesn't go try to retest $300 and get stuffed between $304 and $311 over the next month, but I'm saying that if it doesn't start printing big red dildo's like it's the only job it has, I would just buy puts at resistance for a month out . Good news is, if we actually do get a solid retest of 308, you'll be able to buy Jan 2021 $350-$370 leaps cheap af and roll those profits into a bulk purchase of butthole bottle rockets direct from the factory.", "created_utc": 1580140135, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eupmri/coronavirus_is_a_low_iq_narrative_for_the_spy/", "is_self": true}
