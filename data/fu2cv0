I know you\u2019re freaking out about your tendies after you completely misunderstood what u/variation-separate said regarding today being, what he thought to be, \u201cthe most important trading day of the year.\u201d For an explanation as to what he meant by that, check out his comments on his most recent big \ud83d\udc3b \ud83c\udf08 star(oil)wars post. That\u2019s not what this is about.\n\nThis post should bring you gay bears more comfort than the can of paint you huff every night while you watch your wife get rammed by her hairy-assed boyfriend. So buckle up (as in, your helmets) and break out the Jergens, because we\u2019re about to get our jerks in to these gains the next few weeks and months.\n\n**This Crash Has Been In The Making for a Long Time**\n\nI know you gaggle of fuckatrons are jacked to the tits in SPY puts and as such, only care about U.S. large cap companies. We all are rather familiar with the success these companies have been benefiting from over the last few years, and the bulls have been jacking their peens to no end over it. Let me peel your eyes off of your RobinHood portfolio and your (at the moment, free) PornHub premium account to look at the performance of global markets for the past decade or so.\n\n[EFA, 1M Candles](https://preview.redd.it/wlk80ex7ejq41.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=a360d09208875f78cbbbd753434e271ee4a5592b)\n\nEFA is an ETF with exposure to securities in Europe, Australia, and the Far East. Some notable names of their 923 holdings include Nestle, Novartis (pharmaceutical company), and Toyota. What\u2019s important about this ETF is that it excludes U.S. and Canada securities. If you want to know more about about it, since I know you\u2019re too incompetent to find the big fucking search bar at the top of your browser, here you go: [https://www.etf.com/EFA#overview](https://www.etf.com/EFA#overview).\n\nTake a look at the chart, particularly post 2007. It\u2019s essentially been trading sideways ever since, with its most recent peak (marked by the big \ud83c\udf08 magenta line)  being *lower* than it was in 2007. Speaking of its most recent peak, take a look at the date of that peak at the bottom of the beautiful magenta line. *This ETF has been on the decline since January of 2018.*\n\nOkay, perhaps that\u2019s a coincidence. Maybe Toyota and Nestle haven\u2019t been sucking enough JPOW BRR printer dick to get their share of that unlimited under-the-table QE.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[EEM, 1M Candles](https://preview.redd.it/digjcc3eejq41.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=086f58c714495d1aa42536963de56ec9ea124be8)\n\nEEM is another ETF that tracks investments of emerging market firms. It\u2019s almost entirely represented by Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, India, and China. Most notable of its 1225 holdings include Alibaba, Samsung, and Tencent (info here: [https://www.etf.com/EEM#efficiency](https://www.etf.com/EEM#efficiency)) Again, we see that it has traded sideways since 2007 and has been on the decline since January of 2018. Let's go bigger.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Courtesy of Rodney E.

This index captures large and mid cap stocks across 22 of 23 developed market countries. It, too, has traded sideways since 2007 and has been on the decline since 2018. I could go on.\n\nAll this is to say, this is a long time coming. As to the why, the short answer is who the fuck knows? The longer answer is likely multi-factorial, resulting from a failure to adequately rectify the fiscal policy shortfalls that caused the \u201808 recession. Lending to those who shouldn\u2019t be lended to in large amounts and being surprised when the whole shebang goes tits up, then slapping a band-aid on the issue by slashing interest rates and creating stimulus packages (sound familiar?) Let\u2019s not even bother reinstating laws like the Glass-Steagall act that many economists believe would have prevented it all to begin with, let\u2019s just fix it long enough to make it someone else\u2019s problem after the boomers die or retire. The failure to eliminate the underlying causes of the \u201808 crash has had the global economy teetering on the re-entry into a full blown recession *for years,* but no one gives a fuck here in the states because all we care about are the U.S. large caps. Ya know, \u2018murica and all that bud-light-drinkin\u2019 shit. Stonks be goin up, all is gud.\n\n**Thanks For The History Lesson, but Who Fucking Cares?**\n\nI\u2019m glad you asked. Speaking of history, the average length of a bear market is 10 months (1). Although, averages can be inflated a lot by outliers, like the 1929 bear market that lasted 61 months (2). The shortest ever bear market was 3 months in 1990, and was mostly due to central banking policy attempting to wrangle inflation like automod wrangles you autists and the invasion of Saddam Hussein into Kuiwait, causing a spike in oil prices (3). We are hardly 6 weeks into this bear market and, needless to say, these are very different circumstances.\n\nThis is not an issue that can be band-aided through stimulus packages and slashed interest rates. All these years of high-risk lending is going to dick everyone down by these cuts in production caused by the beervirus. I sincerely believe that the Fed and the gov\u2019t in general are just delaying the inevitable (and vegafucking my tendies) under the aforementioned retarded boomer logic. \n\nWe\u2019re in it for the long haul boys. Diamond hands.\n\nTl;Dr Learn to read, it\u2019s not that long. It\u2019s fuc and it\u2019s been fuc ever since 2008. SPY $220p 5/15\n\nSources:\n\n1.

Constable on YouTube. He\u2019s a little dry, but he\u2019s the former VP of an investment firm and seems to know his shit (but does not, at all, understand how to market himself online). Check him out and listen to his shit on 1.5x speed, makes it much more \ud83d\udc3bable.\n\nEdit: The only part of this post geared towards predicting the future is the final part regarding the average length of bear markets. However, since JPOW and TrumpTheCuck are taking unprecedented action, who knows what could happen. I believe really long dated puts are pretty safe here, because I don't think the question is what direction we're headed, but rather how fast.\nThe general sentiment I'm trying to convey is that based on the performance of other markets, this should not be that fucking surprising. Additionally, who knows what international implications this beervirus crash will lead to. '08 ultimately led to the collapse of Greece's economy (source: https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-the-greece-debt-crisis-3305525).", "created_utc": 1585891020.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fu2cv0/this_crash_has_been_in_the_works_for_years/", "is_self": true}
