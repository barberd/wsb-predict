FREE TENDIES", "selftext": "I was right about my RAD puts, you would be up around 110% if you bought in at open.\n\nThe next play is now $4 Puts for NIO 1/10/19 expiration.\n\nThere is going to be a massive sell-off tomorrow. People are going to want to reap in their rewards.\n\nThere is an investors meeting, but it shouldn\u2019t affect the stock price in a major way. If anything they\u2019re going to dilute the stock which will drive it down.\n\n\nNIO has no cashflow and it\u2019s in need of some cash\n\nFree tendies! Thank me later!
