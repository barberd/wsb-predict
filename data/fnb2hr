Even if we think that this bear market will last half as long, that's still 4 more months of bear market to go.\n\nLooking at this, it seems like there's very little reason SP 200p dated August or later won't be a very good bet, but I've learned to be leery of sure things, so I'd like to hear arguments for why in 4 months the SP 500 will be higher.\n\nTLDR: Why are SP 200P dated august or later not free money?", "created_utc": 1584925394.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fnb2hr/what_are_some_arguments_for_why_this_time_its/", "is_self": true}
