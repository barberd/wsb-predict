Why do you think DIS has held strong in the past week while every other company has dropped -5% or more (except daddy TSLA)? Here's why:\n\nThey have only 1 out of their 12 theme parks in China, impact of the temporary closure of one frickin park is WAY overblown.  \n\nLast quarter releases were HUGE in the theatres. Frozen 2 became the largest grossing animated film of all time at 1.5 billion, star wars grossed over 1 billion as well.  \n\nDisney+ is expanding to Europe earlier than expected and subscriber count is booming.  They can fund this platform with earnings from their other businesses while Netflix has to fund all of their expansions through debt. Disney will win this war.  \n\nAny negatives for the last quarter or 2020 is all fear mongering and negative speculation with very little basis behind it. Shorts are scared (with good reason), and are trying to cuck investors like Markopolos did to everyone with GE 6 months ago.  \n\nDIS to the moon. Hold this for the long run.  \n\nPlease consult a professional advisor before making any investment decisions.", "created_utc": 1580771497, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eyfypy/get_ready_for_some_wonderfully_delicious_mickey/", "is_self": true}
