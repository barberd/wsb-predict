People should have and should be reorganizing their portfolio to have more high yield and more fixed income at this point of the business cycle. High Yield is an alternative to equity, not fixed income... A lot of you are not just gambling, you're gambling without any of the knowledge required and chasing insane returns.\n\nAmeriCold Realty Trust owns, operates and leases cold storage warehouses. Many grocery companies and companies like Amazon are now delivering food nation wide. This segment is growing and these companies need to store fruits, vegetables, diary and meats in strategic warehouses everywhere in the United States. This company looks a lot like a REIT but acts more like regular equity. They advertise very little and are always the first to buy land in areas and build cold storages, it's their specialty and people hire them just to do that. Company has seen a lot of growth in the pass few years and some of the numbers look a little wonky but it's certainly something most of you should be buying and holding. There still pouring most of their earnings back into growth.\n\nCold storage is in demand and COLD is the play.", "created_utc": 1567545248, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/czaz7e/cold_americold_realty_trust/", "is_self": true}
