{"id": "g6md8d", "title": "UPDATE: PRPL is killing it during COVID! This will only go up.", "selftext": "I [posted a week ago why PRPL will go to $12-$14 by 5/12 and $20-$24 by end of Q1 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g30vst/covid_recovery_play_prpl_to_1214_by_512_and_2024/), but that was before I was aware that Purple CEO Joe Megibow gave [this podcasting interview](https://www.spreaker.com/user/9041999/valley-voice-podcast-ep-9-purple-ceo-on-).\n\nIn the podcast, Joe shared some very juicy bits of information:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q1 Wholesale Revenue**\n\nWholesale revenue has accelerated to 50% of sales (an increase from 36% of net revenue from Q4).   We know that wholesale revenue was largely unaffected up until the 3/9 earnings calls, per the earnings call.  As of 3/26, PRPL still had [half of their wholesale doors](https://investors.purple.com/press-releases/news-details/2020/Purple-Innovation-Withdraws-2020-Guidance-Due-to-COVID-19-Impact/default.aspx) operating.  As of now, most wholesale doors are closed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Online Sales are Skyrocketing**\n\nOn the podcast, Joe said that ***online sales have skyrocketed***.   We can infer that these sales have largely offset the drop off in wholesale sales as ***90% of the furloughed workforce has already been recalled*** as of this week.  PRPL only furloughed [35% of their workforce](https://investors.purple.com/press-releases/news-details/2020/Purple-Innovation-Provides-COVID-19-Related-Business-Update/default.aspx) anyways, so that means they are back operating with 96.5% of their workforce.\n\nIt kind of makes sense.   Most of you weebs are spending half of your day in bed and you want your bed to be comfy while you snuggle your waifu.   Add the government stimulus checks that went out last week and I bet PRPL has seen an additional boost to sales (the podcast was last week as well).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What does this mean?**\n\nDirect-to-consumer online sales have greater revenues and gross margins than wholesale sales for Purple.  With Purple operating at 96.5% of their workforce (or most of their unit capacity) and selling at higher revenues and margins, ***I would expect Q2 to be a beat on revenue*** and likely EBITDA.   Q1 was largely in the bag before the effects of COVID kicked in.\n\nThe net result of COVID of PRPL seems to be 4 weeks of less than full production, but a shift to higher revenue and gross margin per unit.  Seems to me that a stock that was in the $15-$16 range pre-COVID, should not be trading at $9 given their outlook in the intermediate and long term with COVID has actually improved.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Donation Mattresses**\n\nJoe discussed on the podcast and [PRPL did a press release a few minutes ago](https://investors.purple.com/press-releases/news-details/2020/Purple-Commits-US-Manufacturing-Resources-To-Help-Fight-Against-COVID-19/default.aspx) discussing the relief beds they've designed for shelters.  It looks like they are making about 1,000 special mattresses for medical relief and donating them.   We applaud the initiative.   Comparing 1,000 units to their normal manufacturing capacity, this seems to be a trivial amount of capacity.   It may open a longer term business opportunity when COVID has passed as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am still long a bunch of PRPLW warrants and very bullish.    There is still time to buy to get in ahead of 5/12 (est) earnings call.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/11p76y0bmku41.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa544e387a416ef79b45130fd4ff3b258c9ef84b", "created_utc": 1587647474.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6md8d/update_prpl_is_killing_it_during_covid_this_will/", "is_self": true}
