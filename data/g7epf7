{"id": "g7epf7", "title": "Basic debit spread.. avoiding being assigned", "selftext": "Hi y'all.\n\nI bought a basic debit spread for my x96 SNAP 4/24 $15.5 put a few days back to avoid getting total fucked in case what happened today happened and to lock in some gains, $2300 worth of my current $3900 at the time.\n\nWell, I still have the spread right now and obviously it's pretty fucked but I want to close the spread out. I tried to close it but it hasn't been filled.\n\nI have:\n\nsold x96 SNAP $15 put (now sitting at $0.01 premium) bought 96 SNAP $15.5 put (now sitting at $0.02 premium)\n\nMy $2300 worth of gains is still in cash in my account, and I want to get out of the spread to avoid any assignment/problems as i've heard if my $15.5 original put expires ITM while my $15 expires OTM it can be a headache.\n\nSeeing as my spread close hasn't filled, does anybody know what I need to do to take care of this? I was under the impression I lock my portion of my gains in by entering the spread. If I buy back the options.. won't I lose my gains I locked in? I'd like to try and keep the portion of the gains I locked in but close the spread.. so what gives and how do I go about navigating this?\n\n**Just want to close out of this and am wondering if I'm missing something, any help would be wonderful. Thanks guys.**", "created_utc": 1587756015.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7epf7/basic_debit_spread_avoiding_being_assigned/", "is_self": true}
