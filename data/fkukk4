{"id": "fkukk4", "title": "Coronavirus Priced In?", "selftext": "This morning, Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief wrote about how economists are starting to believe that this pandemic is now priced in. Now, I'm no economist, nor do I want to be one, but I think these claims are egregious. We're only two weeks into this mess, it took China almost two months to get back to work. The market is constantly testing new lows and portfolio managers on CNBC keep discussing the new risks that come with social-distancing procedures. Firms are more levered than ever, the Saudi's and Russian's are in an oil war which is inadvertently crushing U.S. oil companies that took huge loans after the Great Recession. Airlines, hospitality, cruises, restaurants, retailers, dentists, etc are being put on furlough. The hospitality industry itself is asking for $150bn to help get over this situation. Keep in mind the VERY controversial GM bailout was $11.2bn. Speaking of the auto industry, they will completely shut down starting tomorrow. Many states are also starting to make declarations allowing home owners and renters delayed payments.\n\nAs far as positions go, $200 SPY puts a month or more out. For those of you making tendies and feeling charitable, I ask to first consider donating to neighbors or friends with children. Times of uncertainty like this can be scary when they don't completely understand what's happening.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/market-may-have-priced-in-coronavirus-recession-morning-brief-101849179.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/market-may-have-priced-in-coronavirus-recession-morning-brief-101849179.html)", "created_utc": 1584556531.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkukk4/coronavirus_priced_in/", "is_self": true}
