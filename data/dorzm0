I went through a whole charade with target's online chat associate that took up my whole morning so I could get the god damn product delivered. Eventually they noted that it wasn't possible for me to get product anymore since item was out of stock. This is terrible, short Target.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: had bad experience at target, short target.", "created_utc": 1572365420, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dorzm0/short_tgt_target/", "is_self": true}
