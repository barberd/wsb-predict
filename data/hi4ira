Looking for new info as to whether this might be temporary or worth sitting things out for a spell I came across a report published yesterday.  Having previously commented that I believed FSLY would be 250 by Jan 2022, i felt obligated to share if only to balance my personal opinions against a 3rd party (robo) analyst. \n\nThe 6/26 research report findings that put FSLY in the 21st percentile among 2850 covered stocks and ranking it 314th out of 453 Tech Sector Stocks.  among their comments were accounting adjustments that appear to overstate earnings. A summary of the accounting adjustments included: \n\n* FSLY's accounting earnings overstate its economic earnings, which equal (ROIC - WACC) \\* Average Invested Capital.\n* For FSLY, we made a total of $140 million in income statement and balance sheet adjustments to convert accounting earnings to economic earnings in FY19.\n* We made $223 million in adjustments in our DCF valuation of the stock.\n* We make, in general, 10 types of income statement adjustments to derive NOPAT, 12 types of balance sheet adjustments to derive Average Invested Capital, & 10 types of valuation adjustments in our reverse DCF valuation models.\n\nIf there's a way to upload the PDF, please let me know and i'll share it.
