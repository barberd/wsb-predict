I have a feeling it will continue to grow strong for the rest of the upcoming year. After going to Taiwan this summer(girls are pretty) I realized I needed to invest heavily.\n\nSo like any rational person trusting their gut, just doubled down on TSM by putting down $10k on 65 leaps for Jan 2022. I also put $4k on the stock itself, $3k on 60 calls in Apr 2020. The reason for this is that I just got access to options through my broker(the stocks were bought back when it was $54). \n\nYeah, the reason Im going into TSM is because Taiwanese girls are pretty, I believe there is a strong correlation between the two.
