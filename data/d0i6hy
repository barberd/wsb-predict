{"id": "d0i6hy", "title": "VPY / VPYYF - Software Company to the MOON", "selftext": "VersaPay \n(VPY - Toronto Stock Venture Exchange)\n(VPYYF - OTC)\n\nFellow autists, on a random tip from a client, I have learned about a little $72MM company based out of Toronto called VersaPay. \n\nThis company utilizes their proprietary accounts receivable software to facilitate DIGITAL B2B payments. In case you guys didn\u2019t know, the majority of all business to business payments is still done via check. VersaPay is looking to move this process to the cloud. \n\nBULL CASE:\n-Approximately 88-100% top line growth YOY\n-Recently announced partnership with MasterCard \n-White labeled the product through RBC (a 5% penetration into RBC\u2019s client base would be approximately $100MM in revenue for VersaPay)\n-Insulated from major trade war issues due to all revenue being in Canada and the US\n-Huge market potential with large US companies\n-Proven leadership team with no felons or shady people in the C-suite \n\nCURRENT STOCK PRICE, $1.60 CAD\n-Price targets of $3.75, $4, $2, and $2.30\n\nBEAR CASE:\n-Unable to gain traction in the space, there are a few competitors \n-Somewhat high cash burn rate (though not crazy)\n\n\n\nThis is a pretty rare opportunity to get a growth stock that trades at approximately 8x revenue for 2019. This is a compelling risk reward opportunity.", "created_utc": 1567783745, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d0i6hy/vpy_vpyyf_software_company_to_the_moon/", "is_self": true}
