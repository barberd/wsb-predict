This market is as autistic as us. So just hold onto your shit, puts calls anything. Market will come around and give you a hug like a good boy. Also, buy shit that's like far away for wiggle room unlike me who bought shit expiring in 2 days. \n\nGraph and positions. Limit orders sold almost everything by now except 3/20 ones. No selling history because RH has spammed the shit out of history with my canceled orders. \n\n[https://imgur.com/gallery/mqumbfU](https://imgur.com/gallery/mqumbfU)", "created_utc": 1583432876.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fdzlsr/spy_gains_just_fucking_hold_your_shit_or_ask_rh/", "is_self": true}
