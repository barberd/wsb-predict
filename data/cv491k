Load up on puts soon after open on some bullshit PPT pump bump, ride \u2018em down until we hit a bottom, perhaps 281-283, then sell. Rinse and repeat as we cycle to find lower highs and new lows in this fucked bi-polar market. At 280 wait to see if SPY breaks past 279 then buy calls to sell before EOW as we push back up. \n\nThe only tits up anyone\u2019s gonna see is Xi watching Trump\u2019s manboobs jiggle pathetically as he gives it to him slow, missionary-style. That\u2019s how the Chinese do it.", "created_utc": 1566708227, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cv491k/riding_the_spy_down_early_next_week/", "is_self": true}
