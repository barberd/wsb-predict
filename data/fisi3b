My dad and I have literally been to 6 different grocery stores. 3 of my last cheques have been held until recently, plus rent, so we haven\u2019t been able to purchase food lately. Our fridge is now empty, and we decided to stock up on some things incase of quarantine due to \ud83c\udf7bvirus. EVERY store we have been to is completely sold out of toilet paper, meat, potatoes, pasta & sauces, ramen, hand sanitizer, etc. Shelves are fucking empty, and we have been LIED to. We ARE currently feeling supply-chain shortages, and we ARE fuk. Tl;dr, short any Toronto ETF\u2019s, banks, TSX, etc. Canadian banks are considered some of the best banks for surviving in recession or down-trend markets. Our stock will crash, but it is unlikely to go bankrupt.\n\nEdit: as pointed out from another redditor, supply-chain could be fine and it is just a retail issue due to not ordering enough from media fear mongering.\n\nWill post pictures tomorrow when I go back out to look for tp and meat.", "created_utc": 1584231668.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fisi3b/i_live_in_canada_we_are_fucked/", "is_self": true}
