I was out test driving a Tesla Model 3 the other day (my wife's boyfriend said I couldn't buy an S, I hate that guy) and the salesman told me the \"Navigate on Autopilot\" feature is actually a full blown level 5 self driving feature. Unfortunately, it is capped at level 2 right now because *the man* is keeping them down, but he assured me there is nothing stopping them from releasing it after they get the okay from Washington.\n\nIf you're anything like me, you realized this is amazing DD! Tesla would never lie about performance or over-hype themselves, and this salesman seemed pretty on the ball! The only real question is what to do with this DD.\n\nAs I'm sure you all know, #YangGang is taking over in 2020. I honestly don't even know why they're bothering to have an election. A $1,000 Freedom Dividend annually so we can cut loose and let the robots take over is such a good ideal it literally can't go tits up. Once Yang is in office, it shouldn't take him more than a day to get the Freedom Dividend out to people and change all those pesky laws keeping tech companies down. Tesla does over the air updates, so it won't take long at all until everyone driving a Tesla has a sweet robo-chauffeur to do their bidding. \n\nOnce all Teslas are fully self driving, everyone will want to buy shares of the company. Plus, everyone will have their $1,000 in Freedom Dividends to push the stock straight moonbound!\n\nThe only problem I can find is there are no $TSLA $4,200C 11/4/2020s for sale. The MMs want to hoard all the tendies for themselves! The closest I can find is $690C 1/15/2021. I want to make sure I get the $4,200Cs so I can make more money when it moons (4,200&gt;660). \n\nSo, should I reach out to Robinhood support or go straight to the banks like in The Big Short?\n\nTLDR: Yang + Robo-slaves + $TSLA = Tendies", "created_utc": 1566665697, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cuvv4j/tsla_4200c_1142020/", "is_self": true}
