This was the first human to human transmission of the virus within the UK borders.\n\nWithin 2 days, we now have 3 confirmed cases in Hertfordshire (south-east), Berkshire (southeast) and Gloucestershire (close to Wales). As we know, confirmed cases are much lower than the real figures and it is almost certain that it is spreading across the southeast now.\n\nThe UK government is rushing to pass emergency laws on Monday and there's talk about shutting down schools across the southeast. \n\nIt's becoming a shitshow. Pharmacies are now selling out of facemasks for the first time since the outbreak in the UK. \n\nBe sure to bet on new cases coming out on Tuesday and Wednesday. Buy puts on UK ETFs or short the ADRs of companies like Ryanair.", "created_utc": 1582998813, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fbg7ms/dd_on_coronavirus_from_england/", "is_self": true}
