{"id": "fh7k3r", "title": "Six Flags (SIX) is worthless garbage.", "selftext": "Six Flags is a  company that operates amusement parks around the country.\n\nSIX currently has a debt to asset ratio of 1.25 (this is considered as highly levered as this means SIX currently does not have enough assets to cover their liabilities in full). Both Moodys and S&P have recently set forth a negative outlook on their bonds (S&P before coronavirus breakout) and they have notes due Jul 2024 (500M  4.875%) and Apr of 2027 (700m  5.5% ). Both of these bonds pay out bi-annual coupons at the rates mentions above.\n\nNow anyone with a shred of common sense would look at these numbers by themselves and realize that a 80y/o lung cancer patient could breath and blow this shit over.  But wait! There is more.\n\nSIX is also currently the target of a class action lawsuit for misleading shareholders. They basically lied about the progress they were making on their Chinese expansion and construction and stated that they expected to see \" weaker-than-anticipated quarterly revenue from its agreements with Riverside (the real estate dev company) in 2019 and 2020.\u00a0\n\nLets take a look at their company's profitability (or lack thereof) now.\n\nQ1 2019: -0.86\n\nQ2 2019: 0.94\n\nQ3 2019: 2.11\n\nQ4 2019: -0.13\n\nQ1 2020 Guidance: -1.03\n\nThese are numbers you would expect to see from a company that is still growing and is eating up capital to fund that. Not a 59 y/o company with negligible revenue growth. At their growth levels they should be able to generate profit consistently.\n\nThis is a dogshit company that will go bankrupt once again like it did during the financial crisis (for very similar reasons mind you) and will be forced to sell locations.\n\nThey have a measly  174,179,000 in cash right now with   130,304,000 as their cost of revenue meaning  that they barely have enough cash to continue operations for a year.\n\nIF SIX FLAGS IS FORCED TO SHUTTER LOCATIONS THEY WILL 100% DEFAULT ON BOND PAYMENTS. There is no world where they will use their minuscule amount of cash to pay coupons. TTM operating income is at  436,250,000 which I expect to either be negative or zero as they close locations because of closing locations. Earnings are Apr 21 which will without a doubt tank with perhaps some bad news lumped in with the earnings call.\n\nFully expect this company to be a penny stock by EOY and delisted and who the fuck goes to six flags to begin with.\n\nBuy any puts you please.\n\nSea World (SEAS) DD to come. I opened a small position today and plan to buy more tomorrow.
