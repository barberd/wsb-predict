Heres a volume based TA Analysis:\n\nIndicators you see are session volume, and Monthly and Yearly Pivots.\n\n$SPY has a 2-Day P.O.C of $295.60 and we have just rejected the YEARLY PIVOT\n\nHuge level, big boi rejection.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wzcpkw081rz41.jpg?width=1247&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a0c23ae89af112fc8638b7fc488940d23619cfc8\n\nNow theres the 650pt gap sitting precariously below:\n\n[Notice the massive sell volume on this rejection.](https://preview.redd.it/b3ifyt0k1rz41.jpg?width=1259&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=697d10bd13ff250dd257a09e386f1824a320ea92)\n\nOn HTF you can see a x3 top, albeit a bit sloppy\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wasxglg42rz41.jpg?width=1261&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ace940486c7d1d290bc8c32d91bf5f9b8b8c1dc3\n\nAbove us we have a psychological resistance of $300 after a bigly run up which has now effectively stalled out.\n\nMax pain for 5/22 is $289 but the above tells me we overshoot by a bit and fill that fuckin Grand Canyon of a gap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*TLDR: $SPY $286P 5/22 gonna print bigly*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit: When this works i will throw all profits into the YOLO of a lifetime and will post the entire thing so you gays can join.
