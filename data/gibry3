The big boy lenders were only lending out to 700+ credit 20% down, these guys however were not doing that and now they are screwed. 8% forbearance and climbing, 20-30% unemployment, a lot of this is retail/service industry that will not be bouncing back as companies are going under.  These workers that saved up enough to buy a house they can barely afford will be foreclosing just like in 08/09, the banks that serviced the loans will best case scenario take a major hit, worst case bankruptcy.  \n\nTo make it worse, the regional banks don't have new revenue coming in, people aren't applying for new lines of credit (at least not successfully..), new home loans aren't being issued unless you have massive cash reserves and diamond credit, in short these guys aren't making any money now or in the next 3-6 months.  \n\n\nSo, how do we make money on this?  \n\n\nBelow is a list of publicly traded regional banks that have been getting their asses kicked the most.\n\nGWB\n\nBHLB\n\nBCOW\n\nMCBS\n\nUNB\n\nNKSH\n\nNCBS\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow some of the regional banks are doing OK, by OK I mean they are flat with no volume.\n\nBRBS\n\nAUB\n\nFCBC\n\nCFB\n\nFBSS\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOthers have even ridden the rally\n\nAMNB\n\nAMRB\n\nBHB\n\nOZK\n\nUBSI\n\nCWBC\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProblem is, you can't buy options on any of these guys.  I would expect they are going to trend down, along with their brethren.  So how do we \"bank\" on these irresponsible greedy fucks tanking?  \n\n\nThere are two ETFs that cover regional banking.  \n\nKRE and IAT\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPositions:  KRE 16p 7/17 IAT 21p 7/17", "created_utc": 1589292099.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gibry3/regional_banks_r_fuck_especially_this_one/", "is_self": true}
