{"id": "bdjxcv", "title": "DD: Trupanion ($TRUP) is a great short-term buy. I was right about $GME and $DIS.", "selftext": "I called $GME and $DIS and now I'm calling $TRUP.  I'm playing their upcoming earnings.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is \"less than public\" knowledge as in most folks, including most investors, aren't going to know about it -- but it's still public if you know how to use the tools and interpret the information like I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had no idea $TRUP existed until I saw a brochure at my vet's office.  I hate insurance, I'm not a fan of paying for something and getting a piece of paper to keep in my glove box (or wallet) in return.  I don't go to the doctor.  I don't get into car accidents (yet).  I just see some shit come out of my bank account so I can keep my ~~Mercedes~~ ~~Toyota~~ ~~Hyundai~~ GM legal.  I pay $200/mo just in case I fly with $BA and somehow survive a crash and need a doctor.  I love it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, back to $TRUP.  When I was growing up poor we never took our dogs to the vet, we let them roam wild in the country like wolves.  I have to take my pit regularly now because the neighbor keeps requesting his \"up-to-date shot records\" -- I mean, do you need to see them after EVERY bite?   Jesus Christ man.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, pet insurance is something I actually use now.  And considering how much people love their pets, visits to the vet aren't something that take a huge hit in an economic downturn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can read all the stats about why this is and will be a booming industry in their investor presentation:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://s21.q4cdn.com/119804282/files/doc\\_presentations/2019/03/TRUP-Investor-Presentation-March\\_FINALv3.pdf](https://s21.q4cdn.com/119804282/files/doc_presentations/2019/03/TRUP-Investor-Presentation-March_FINALv3.pdf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOther than the great financials here and growth potential (pet insurance is common overseas, not yet adopted in the US yet), consider the information I'm offering.  Check out their organic search traffic over the past quarter (and beyond):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://imgur.com/dSFJdmq](https://imgur.com/dSFJdmq)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is the \"less than public\" knowledge part.  This isn't inside information, this is an approximate of traffic and how it's increased over the past couple of years for Trupanion's main website.  You'll see how it's increased drastically over the past quarter and especially YOY.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part of this is that organic traffic -- traffic that arrives on a website through Google, Bing (lol), etc -- is a relatively fixed cost (you pay the people to make it rank well, but the costs don't go up along with the traffic) is pure profit.  It's just money in the bank, they're not paid ads.  Organic traffic is also something that most analysts or \"pro\" investors can't forecast, Google organic search results are updated sporadically and like I said -- this isn't very public knowledge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUntil now.  I'm not suggesting what someone else should do, but I'm personally using this public-but-not-easily-found information to buy medium to long-range calls.  The history of this stock is incredibly healthy.  Not a meme stock.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI expect as we get close to the earnings report DD posts like this will popup and IV will go up as well...", "created_utc": 1555354740, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bdjxcv/dd_trupanion_trup_is_a_great_shortterm_buy_i_was/", "is_self": true}
