I have been buying into expirations 2 weeks out or so and realizing how retarded that is and much the value is lost when expiration is about 30 days away. \n\nWhat is your guys\u2019 general rule of thumb when it comes to options, and what expiration do you look for? \n\nI\u2019m also confused on buying ITM and OTM. Any suggestion from you gambling geniuses would be appreciated.\n\nPG 127c 4/24 (-99.15%) EPD 13.5c 4/24 (-99%)", "created_utc": 1587763071.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7gueb/options_lose_value_over_time_how_long_term_do_i/", "is_self": true}
