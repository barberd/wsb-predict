I saw that it was unable to hold 2000, so I scooped up poots. The rest of my portfolio is currently just stocks, but I\u2019ll provide entry and exits along with BP change in the span of 5hrs. \n\nPossible Questions: \n\nWhy\u2019d you sell at 1965? I thought 1960 would be the bottom as it was about 200sma on 6m4h.\n\nWhy\u2019d you buy calls immediately after selling puts? I believed that there\u2019s a support at the 200sma, also thought market was oversold as a whole. \n\nWhy so fucking much money into one position? Autistic as shit, obvious. \n\nAre your cars rentals? yes\n\nWhat\u2019ll you spend the money on? Hookers and blow\n\nFeel free to ask questions if you want, my DM is open.
