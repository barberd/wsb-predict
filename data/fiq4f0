{"id": "fiq4f0", "title": "Debit Spread Disaster - RH Account Restricted", "selftext": "On Monday, I opened 10 put debit spreads on AAPL (277.50/275) for $1,000. On Friday, during the end of day rally, my spreads went from being comfortably ITM to OTM. Typically, RH closes your spread if your too close to being OTM but I\u2019m guessing there was little volume that late in the day, or the system couldn\u2019t pick it up due to how quickly the stock rose.\n\nI woke up this morning with 200 shares of AAPL and an email from RH saying that my account is restricted (can only sell; cannot buy) and that I must deposit $24k by Thursday. Apparently, they were able to close out the 10 277.50 legs, but only closed 8 of the 275 legs. They then used margin (which I have disabled) to exercise the option. \n\nNow I have 200 shares of Apple. The way I see it, I have two options. I can deposit the 24k (which I don\u2019t have and would have to borrow from a family member/friend). Or I can sell at open on Monday (or anytime before Thursday) but I\u2019m worried how red we\u2019re going to be next week. I\u2019m also worried that I have to pay the 5% interest for using margin. \n\nWhat would be the best play at this point? Do you think I have any shot of reversing anything by calling them Monday morning?\n\nEDIT: Spread was 277.50/275, no 255 as originally stated", "created_utc": 1584222185.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fiq4f0/debit_spread_disaster_rh_account_restricted/", "is_self": true}
