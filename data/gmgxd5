So ignore through this story.\"\n\nhttps://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1260591822990163969?s=19\n\nDefinitely someone from CNBC is temporarily short on Abbott or loading up on the lows. \n\nAbbott's response is \"The NYU study results are not consistent with other studies. For example, in another recent study in Washington state, out of approximately 1,000 subjects there were 23 positive for COVID-19 on a lab test and ID NOW picked up 21, demonstrating 91% sensitivity and 100% specificity. We have many questions for the study authors.\"\n\nhttps://www.abbott.com/corpnewsroom/product-and-innovation/abbott-response-to-the-NYU-study.html\n\nThe question is when is $ABT going to rip again, the charts are closing in, hovering around .786 levels. Most likely will gap up soon when more news on wide spread adoption of Abbott Antibody tests are out which are already in use by various hospitals and states. \n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-ABT", "created_utc": 1589859423.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gmgxd5/abbott_response_to_the_nyu_study_and_false/", "is_self": true}
