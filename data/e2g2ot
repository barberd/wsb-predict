{"id": "e2g2ot", "title": "ALPHA acquired", "selftext": "Anybody ever think to sell ITM weekly covered calls and just \"roll\" (buy this week's and sell one for next week) them to the next week every Thursday?\n\nI started doing this 3 months ago and now have my portfolio hedged significantly below market value, yet have been returning a good deal more than SPY (21% compared to SPY's 8%)\n\nThe tricky part is when something like an AAPL or SQ happens and the ITM covered call becomes a DEEP ITM covered call. In this case, you have the option of maintaining low risk and collecting tiny premiums or increasing the strike of your rolls (and therefore increasing your risk) to collect higher weekly premiums from your rolls. For example, my AAPL strike sitting at $242.5 has been pulling in $30-$40 per week.", "created_utc": 1574861680, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e2g2ot/alpha_acquired/", "is_self": true}
