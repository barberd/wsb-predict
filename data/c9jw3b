And by the way, shout out to all the people who called me retarded for being bullish in Disney because guess what I was right. And an even bigger shout out to the 90% of people on my original post who just commented about the disclaimer instead of about the actual DD.\n\nNEW PICKS THIS SUNDAY.  \n\nThis is not investment advice.
