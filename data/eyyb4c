Although this man started with less money than analfarmer2, the sheer degeneracy and craziness of each of this man's plays will have you clamoring to hear more. He went from zero to hero, to zero, to hero again in under 2 weeks. Use this imgur file to follow along  [https://imgur.com/gallery/Me5IAx3](https://imgur.com/gallery/Me5IAx3) \n\nFor anonymity we're going to stick with calling this man D. How do I know D? well, he's in a trading discord server that I also happen to be in. This man is such a lord that he does not even have a profile picture to his name, yet thousands of dollars to throw into FDs.  He had a string of ridiculous YOLOs, pulling under $3k into over $40k within 2 weeks by yoloing his whole account into AMD, DIS and BYND all before big rips before any of the rest of these events occurred.\n\nThe first I heard of this man was a post he made last Wednesday, January 29, 2020. He had posted in our trading room fretting over how he didn't secure profits. Surely it couldn't have been that bad since most of us aren't using much money so I ask for some images. The first two images in the imgur file were what I was shown. This man had $40,000, it went up to over $60,000 within an hour, and he watched it all trickle away to end in the red by over $5000 on the day because he didn't want to sell anything. If you're wondering what he was bag holding, it was his TSLA and V calls expiring on 1/31. \n\nThe next day, Thursday, D had posted once again about more losses, so I decided it was time to send him a message and ask what the actual hell was going on. As can be seen with the images of some of is Visa calls, he was in a bad spot. He had watched his TSLA play die out and saw his Visa play go from a profit of over $13,000 from an investment of $3000 to being up less than $3000. Even more so was that he was holding these through earnings even though they expired the next day, January 31st, and had even more than tripled down on his position from that point, having over $10,000 on the line. Yet it was for naught. Visa missed earnings and his contracts were going to open the next day worthless. He messaged me saying \" I really screwed up on visa...I went in too big on it thinking that it was going up today and would have great earnings like it usually always does \" Adding onto this tragedy is that he had another over $20,000 in losses that day in other weekly options bringing his account value down to $17000 by Thursday evening.\n\nFriday was a low point in the life of D. Even though he had made over $3000 on AMZN calls from their earnings, all of his $10,000 from Visa was gone along with some other weeklys he had, bringing his account value from over $60,000 to under $10,000 within 3 trading days, more than a full years income for most people. He explained it to me like this after I asked what had happened. \" Ya I made like 3k on Amazon but lost 9-10k on visa. Lost so big on visa... Unbelievable.\" Fortunately for D, lady luck was on his side once again.\n\nAt some point on Monday morning when ignoring all messages about risk management, D yolod the rest of his account into super otm TSLA weekly calls after hearing about their price upgrade. I'm talking $850 and $1000 calls expiring THIS WEEK when Tesla was under $700 per share his positions can be seen in the imgur file above. He was up over $6,000 on his play far in the green from his initial deposits. However, D was concerned about securing profits. His problem was that he was far below the PDT limit still at this point, only a bit over $10,000, and couldn't sell any of his TSLA contracts, so if they went down the next day his account could be going to zero. But lady luck had D's back one last time.\n\nThis morning it was reported in a filing that a TSLA stakeholder had upped his stake from 7.6% to 7.8%. Now as a person that considers myself to be a reasonable investor I wouldn't expect a stock up almost 100% year to date to rip over 20% on this, but TSLA is the equivalent of a penny stock maxed up so it did. As seen in the imgur file, D had weaponized his degeneracy in the most ludicrous of ways, getting back to his old peak of $63,000 and rocketing past it to over $75,000. He had done what most could presume to be impossible: YOLOd to insane profits, lost it all, yet somehow managed to get it all back and more in the exact same fashion. \n\nHowever, we're at a crossroads here. Heading late into the day he had fortunately scaled out of his old positions for huge gains, but had reentered again for some weekly and 1 2/21 $1000 calls on TSLA and had a total of $19,426 in TSLA heading towards the close. I was communicating with him in private messages and was urging him to sell his weekly expirations to protect himself and hold the 2/21 for future upside. But since he hadn't had a full day with his account closed above $25,000 yet, he couldn't day trade. To his dismay we saw TSLA share plummet over 10% within the last 12 minutes of the day, losing him what I presume to be about $10,000 in a flash. However, hope is still here as TSLA is up after hours after Ford's earnings report was an utter disaster. Here's to hoping it holds up and he can recoup some of that in the morning.\n\nDo you want to hear the craziest part about all of this journey though? D has a day job. That's right. D was doing all of this, trading weekly expiration and same-day expiration options while working a day job where he would have no idea what was happening to his positions for hours at a time. Not only did he YOLO his whole account time and time again, but he had no idea what the hell was happening much of the time too. Right now we're working on proper risk management strategies and getting him over to a better broker, but here's to D's journey.\n\nRe-link to the imgur file:   [https://imgur.com/gallery/Me5IAx3](https://imgur.com/gallery/Me5IAx3)", "created_utc": 1580854969, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eyyb4c/the_story_of_d_the_craziest_discord_yoloer_who/", "is_self": true}
