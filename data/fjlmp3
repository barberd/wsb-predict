Now we\u2019re trying to fix the TDAs version of infinite margin and get me some form of compensation for the 500% I couldn\u2019t get. \n\nTl;dr TDA gave me infinite margin to enslave myself but they\u2019re currently trying to unfuck the situation.\n\nUpdate: Just got my update, TDA isn't fixing my loss, they figured since I'm up I should be happy.
