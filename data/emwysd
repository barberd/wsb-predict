{"id": "emwysd", "title": "A lot of us need some emotional support. Here's my story", "selftext": "Freshly graduated out of college, I had the genius idea that I would invest in the stock market. It was all great and fun at first with the stock market being relatively cheap to invest in. Companies weren't all too developed. So I had a good time and gained about 8% on my 4k investment. Doesn't sound a lot, but 4k goes a long way for a fresh graduate. Fast forward 4 months, I saw people making big plays on options. So of course, the typical RH user in me checked off the list for options and dived in. I remember going for Canada Goose calls, went way OTM when I didn't even know what OTM was. What do you know? The stock jumps 5% the next day and I caught a sweet 2k return. I was hooked. \n\nThe option game went well for only about two weeks until I ran into my first big loss. I forget exactly what it was, but it took a fat dump on me. Lost 2.5k. So I went back in, full steam and went for ATM calls. This time around I was a bit more experienced, but luck was not on my side. Lost another 2.5k. At this point, I was still positive. Long story short, by year's end, I was down 5k. Fast forward another year, I was down 15k. I took a year break and got back on my feet. Still, lost another 5k that year even safely trading a combination of stocks and options. Stocks did well, options fell through the rood for me. So, I'm at -25k at this point. I've got about 3k left and I FINALLY came to the realization that I have a gambling problem. If you aren't into trading options, and especially day trading them, **don't fucking do it.** For me, I didn't lose a life threatening amount of money, but it is a whole lot of money. \n\nWith the remaining 3k, I'm going to offset some risk with some SP500 stocks and only play 1-2 month out options with only a max of 1-2 contracts per buy. If you're hard headed and still want to dive into options (if you haven't already started), be smart. Don't go OTM. Pay the bigger premium, take the smaller gains and learn when to cut the losses. Be disciplined by friends. Hopefully, I can tell a better story - a comeback story if you will. \n\nHappy to listen to others that are in deep shit like myself.", "created_utc": 1578689429, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/emwysd/a_lot_of_us_need_some_emotional_support_heres_my/", "is_self": true}
