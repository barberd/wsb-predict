It only uses GE statements that are available to the public.  He likens the LTC insurance accounting fraud to AIG.   They were bailed out.  \n\nMarkopolos has a pretty strong track record of fighting fraud cases like this; Enron and Worldcom\n\nIm thinking Culp knew about it but felt like he had time to deal with it or may be gone before it get really out of control.  However, now that its out in the public, GE has to deal with it properly and that is impossible it seems from a liquidity stand point.  The amount they need is 40% of their marketcap.  So possibly chapter 11 to restructure in order to meet all their liabilities.  \n\n\nI personally think Culp\u2019s response was not the best, I was hoping for a rebuttal such as: well we have LTC stuff already accounted for.  But instead he kind of tries to debase Markopolos\u2019 reputation with the whole market manipulation verse.  That tells me its a real problem. \n\n\nWas wondering about anyone else\u2019s thoughts and positions on GE?", "created_utc": 1565900290, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cqvcx5/ge/", "is_self": true}
