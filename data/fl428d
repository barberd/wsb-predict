Say they get deliveries on bread everyday\u2014Sold out daily. Dairy comes in every other like the butcher, and canned goods like Campbells will be solid bets when the market levels off.\n\nSeriously, thinking about some tickers easy; COST, KR, CPB, PG. Buy leaps at the money or even out. These businesses are booming right now. Empty shelves, I haven\u2019t seen this shit in my entire life. Look back at this time if you survive the kung-flu, and watch them OTM LEAPS go deep ITM after earnings.
