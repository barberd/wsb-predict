{"id": "cujtwp", "title": "Profiting off some Aussie's family problems", "selftext": "I have a really simple investment thesis supporting a long position in HP Inc.  In 2015, the well-established computer software and printing giant spun off its its cloud services business from the rest of its traditional model.  Investors initially assessed the growth potential for the spin-off to be higher than the parent.  They were wrong:  under the leadership of the Australian CEO Dion Weisler, HP Inc. experienced a period of essentially nonstop growth until late 2018.  \n\nThe past year has been a different story.  Particularly, this week, HP Inc. weathered a tough 6% loss to its stock price.  Turns out our man Dion had to step down from his CEO spot to deal with some family problems.  Investors who're selling right now are presumably reacting to this development.  \n\nHaving done a bit more research, I found this a bit weird.  Yeah, Dion did a good job for HP post spin-off, but earnings this year have been mostly flat.  Why the sudden indication of support for a CEO who recently lost his touch?  If anything, I would have expected the stock to improve marginally at the news.  \n\nThey guy set to replace him is far from incompetent.  He currently runs the printing section of HP's business.  I like this for one big reason:  printing is a struggling department in HP's revenue.  That sucks for HP, because printing's profit margin is so good.  The software department is up a couple percent this year, but the printing dip balanced that growth out and lead to another flat earnings report.  This new guy could offer an added level of expertise to spark growth in highly lucrative printing.\n\nAs of now, it seems that this drop is more of a public panic than a legit response to a worsening market position or anything.  HP, in my opinion, is probably still worth what it was before Dion announced his departure.  It's not like HP is predicting a drop in revenue for next quarter.  All things considered, I expect HP Inc. to recover that 6% in the next three or four months.\n\nLet me know what you guys think.", "created_utc": 1566593918, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cujtwp/profiting_off_some_aussies_family_problems/", "is_self": true}
