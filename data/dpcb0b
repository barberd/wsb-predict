Let's look at what they have coming: \n\nPOKEMON (the biggest franchise in the world by far) is about to be released for a main Nintendo console for the first time ever in a few days. Duh, this is going to make them buckets of money. \n\nGoing into Xmas, they have the typical Switch units and now cheaper portable units that soccer moms will buy their kids thinking it's the typical one marked down. There is basically no excuse for every kid and adult to own a Switch after this Christmas. \n\nOh, and Nintendo is on the brink of opening up sales in China after striking deals with Tencent. Everyone in their totalitarian regime is going to have a switch. In CHINA. \n\nIt's not like this shit is already at all time highs either. It's sitting at $44.06 a share and it used to be around $50 a month ago. $57 less than a year ago. It's in a clear trough. \n\nTell me why I shouldn't drop 30k on this.", "created_utc": 1572467212, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpcb0b/nintendo_ntdoy_is_about_to_take_off/", "is_self": true}
