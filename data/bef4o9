Snapchat has 300+ milion but Pinterest's user base is actually growing. Valuing Pinterest at 2/3s snap is basically saying Pinterest's execution is somehow gonna be worse than Evan spectacles speigel...\n\nPlus if there's anywhere people actually want to see ads its on Pinterest. They have the only product where people are actually looking to buy things. Sure their site is aids but so is Facebook and that shit still prints money. Pinterest's ads could honestly be indistinguishable their actual content if they get their targeting right, especially since real content is approaching unfiltered clickbait anyway.\n\nBasically they're the only social media outside fb products platform that still has strong growth and their niche is social media for shopping. This shit was made for ads.\n\nIn case u needed more convincing it's also white girl heaven 80% female and wants it's users to discover themselves and find what they love in life or something. White girls and tech I don't know why this is ipoing below it's last valuation round but I'll take it\n\nWho's in", "created_utc": 1555547002, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bef4o9/pinterest_dd/", "is_self": true}
