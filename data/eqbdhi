I hold deep OTM SPY puts that don't expire until Dec 2020. How could I not be bearish? P/E is more elevated than a freshman's dick when a blonde senior walks past... IPO failure rates are higher than even the most glue-eatingly retarded days of The Dot-Com Bubble... All the shit for brains around here are making bank with FDs and are talking about quitting their jobs to trade professionally... I think someone's dog even made money off OTM 0DTE SPY calls today. \n\nAll that said, the number's show that I'm the dumbest guy in the room. The Fed is CLEARLY setting us up for the worst hangover since 1929. It's a hell of a party that they've got going on right now, though. While all you fuckers are getting your extra chromosomed dicks wet in high grade hookers, I've been the prohibitionist asshole at the front door reminding everyone of the Volstead Act when what I really SHOULD be doing is partying with you Aspies. \n\nI'll wait for a slight sell-off on SPY come Tuesday AM, then buy some ATM calls that expire 1/24. Why? Because fuck you and your easy money, that's why. I'm holding my puts until after impeachment and until The Fed confirms in Feb that they're continuing the non-QE. I'll also continue selling my covered calls on high IV stocks. \n\nStarting next week, though, I'll dip my toes into the most retarded pool of them all, and join Bull-Gang. It just looks like a lot of fun right now.", "created_utc": 1579319112, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eqbdhi/this_fed_is_retardedly_friendly_and_im_the/", "is_self": true}
