Construction has continued on the line during the COVID-19 pandemic, with adjustments made to take precautions against the virus.\n\nWhen complete, the route will take riders from Miami to Orlando in three hours. For comparison, it typically takes four hours to drive between the two cities. Air travel typically takes an hour, but factoring the time needed for going through security and seating, the time difference is significantly shortened.\n\nVirgin Trains signed a letter of intent with Walt Disney World in 2018 to establish a station at the resort, with engineering and design work for the station currently underway. Virgin Trains president Patrick Goddard said last year about the Orlando line, \u201cIt\u2019s our expectation to get it done and to build out to Disney.\u201d Currently, Brightline operates stations in Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and West Palm Beach.\n\nThe Orlando International Airport station is expected to open in 2022.\n\nedit: added more info", "created_utc": 1590984114.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gudjcm/in_case_anyone_trades_on_dis/", "is_self": true}
