I, u/NervousTumbleweed, am filing for unemployment. \n\nSome may say \"Oof. Unemployment. u/NervousTumbleweed must be concerned about money and probably will stop making YOLOs\". \n\nWell let me tell you right God damn now, that isn't going to happen, Jack. With the new Coronavirus Bill unemployment is paying me pretty much the same God damn salary I was making prior to getting laid off, and you wanna know what? *I don't have to pay rent this month.* \n\nBA $150c 4/9 2.5k\n\n\"Why though\"\n\n\"What makes you think BA will go back up\"\n\nLiterally God damn nothing. A tingly sensation in my balls. Ozone in the air. \n\nI know not if these BA calls will print, but I do know that the government filling my bank account back up is their punishment for being so fucking inept and unprepared, and I am going to spend it in the most reckless and insulting ways possible.", "created_utc": 1585932722.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fubvro/follow_me_brothers/", "is_self": true}
