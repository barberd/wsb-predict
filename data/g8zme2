Apparently that's what happened two weeks ago.\n* If they come unscathed from the months to come, they will remain in growth stonk status once ads start flowing back.\n* Might see small pullback from kids going back to school and daily activity diminishing, that may be priced in tho\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Bearish case (for the next quarter and following 2 weeks too):**\n\n* Ads market is likely fucked (see Google announcement last week, cue Alphabet and FB earnings calls). Less advertisers, less ads on the market. At the same time - more users and activity - eventually less ads (thus revenue) per user as the marketing campaign budget is drained quicker. Excerpt from 10-K.\n\n>***We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. The failure to attract new advertisers, the loss of advertisers, or a reduction in how much they spend could seriously harm our business.***\n\n* Snap expense that bothers me: cloud. Cost of revenue was 32% of OPEX last year (rest is mostly employees and facilities). Scales with users. Excerpt from 10-K \\[1\\].\n\n>*Cost of Revenue*  \n>  \n>Cost of revenue consists primarily of payments to third-party infrastructure partners for hosting our products, which include expenses related to storage, computing, and bandwidth costs.  \n>  \n>\\[...\\]  \n>  \n>*2019 compared to 2018*  \n>  \n>Cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $97.0 million, or 12%, compared to the same period in 2018. The increase in cost of revenue primarily consisted of increased revenue share costs of $54.4 million, consistent with our overall increase in revenue. Additionally, the increase was driven by increased infrastructure costs of $37.9 million, attributable to DAU growth and increased user activity between the periods, net of infrastructure cost efficiencies, and increased advertising measurement expenses.\n\n* Time spent daily is growing (though numbers are not explicitly mentioned in snap ERs, but they boast with more time spent on their different modes) = more expenses, quicker drying out of ads, see the pattern here?\n* BTW, that shilled user growth is 11M from last quarter. It\u2019s not fucking 50%. It\u2019s 5% (229M from 218M). \\[2\\]\\[3\\]\n\nTidbit:\n\n* FB (Insta), TikTok are not sleeping and Snap position for instant/direct ephemeral messages/stories is not for granted. Hell, FB sent them drilling couple years ago when they pimped Instagram. Watch TikTok do the same. Kids are not loyal to apps, they move wherever there is momentum.\n\nCall it what you want, stonk jumping 40% in value over 5% user growth over last quarter when everybody is locked and (significant) growth in YoY time spent in some of their feature is not normal even for meme/growth stonks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Bottom line:**\n\nShort term, in exact this quarter, might be devastating for Snap. With revenue (ads) likely plummeting and expenses continuously growing, the next earnings call looks brutal to me. I know that 2.5 month timeframe is way too much for you, but you can try to drop some FD poots to possibly grab some bucks from FB/GOOGL flop in ad supply.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Sauces:**\n\n\\[1\\] 10-K for the last year: [https://otp.tools.investis.com/clients/us/snap\\_inc/SEC/sec-show.aspx?Type=html&FilingId=13887415&Cik=0001564408](https://otp.tools.investis.com/clients/us/snap_inc/SEC/sec-show.aspx?Type=html&FilingId=13887415&Cik=0001564408)\n\n\\[2\\] Q1 2020 ER: [https://investor.snap.com/\\~/media/Files/S/Snap-IR/press-release/q1-2020-earnings-press%20release.pdf](https://investor.snap.com/~/media/Files/S/Snap-IR/press-release/q1-2020-earnings-press%20release.pdf)\n\n\\[3\\] Q4 2019 ER:  [https://investor.snap.com/\\~/media/Files/S/Snap-IR/press-release/q4-19-earnings-release.pdf](https://investor.snap.com/~/media/Files/S/Snap-IR/press-release/q4-19-earnings-release.pdf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Positions:** None. I might hop onto 2WTE poots (so I can hop out easily) after alphabet earnings, if they message problem with advertising in their call. Next day is FB, which will likely do the same and the FB's ads market is much more overlapping with SNAP than GOOGL.
