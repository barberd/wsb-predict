{"id": "ffd5qh", "title": "Origin Story", "selftext": "\nTLDR: Cannabis grower, WSB noob, county fucked growers, need more tendies to buy bigger landies to grow more planties. Love this place! \n\nGreetings, fellow autists and retards! Noob here. Cannabis/veggie farmer in northern cali. Long story short, county screwed us over after paying 20k+ in taxes and fees and banned commercial cannabis cultivation because old boomers were scared. So now my brother and I sell veggies. Two years later they want to bring it back for people with 20 acres plus. We have 5. My goal is now to make enough tendies to buy enough landies to grow more planties. \n\nGot into RH a month ago while hanging with 88 year old grandpa for 3 weeks. (Been home more than 14 days and feel fine) Deposited $625. Lost $15 playing with cryptos and jumped into buying SPCE cause I love spaceships. After failing to sell high and selling at break even I found this wonderful place. Then I learned about options and tendies and trips to the moon! And I bought a call in APT! \n\nBecause I\u2019m a retard I jumped ship and made a cool $890! Could have waited until peak and almost doubled that. Since I was now a pro I loaded up on MMM calls. You need masks flying to the moon! Also, all the other medical shit they make, right?!?!? 3/6 expired worthless. We\u2019ll see what comes of 3/13 3/20 4/17 ones! \n\nSince then I\u2019ve done some self learning about these here options on the YouTube and I\u2019ve even opened a tos account after the leap year RH debacle. I think I  am becoming more and more autistic each day! I will be sure to take portions of winnings and donate percentage to legitimate causes! I\u2019m felling lucky with OPK 3/20 too! I\u2019ve been finding ways to stay bullish but it might be time to bear down for midterms. Anywho, I just wanted to say hi and good luck to everyone this week! \n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/6XQpMpe", "created_utc": 1583677367, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffd5qh/origin_story/", "is_self": true}
