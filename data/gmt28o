{"id": "gmt28o", "title": "DD: Hop onto the SPCE train before it is too late", "selftext": "Wanted to post this here for the autists that are bored as shit on this pathetic movement and want to secure themselves a 10 bagger in the next week or two.\n\nSPCE is sitting at 15.85 cents a share, which is it\u2019s absolute bottom for the month. Just two weeks ago 5/29 19c were sitting at $2.22 and are now chilling at .26. These are absolutely minimal risk considering 1) how dirt cheap they are and 2) how low SPCE is sitting right now. I\u2019d suggest buying a couple and averaging down when it goes against you. In total it\u2019s a very low (<$100) bet with enormous upside potential.\n \n\nAs to why SPCE will boom, SPCE is a meme and buying memes at the bottom vs buying at the top (after they already rocket) is generally a good strategy if you like to gamble your money here. Not to mention that SPCE is one of the only companies that aren\u2019t overvalued right now (low price target is $24), and they had solid earnings just last week.\n\nI like to gamble on FDs, but even December leaps right now are absolutely dirt cheap and can make you a lot of money if you don\u2019t tissue hands your position. Stop being a bitch and buy at the bottom vs waiting after the meme rockets 25%\n\nI'm plussed 120% on my FD since writing this post but this baby has a LOT more room to run. \n\nWill edit with screenshot but SPCE is soaring so will post now\n\n\nEdit: [My position](https://i.imgur.com/OjgiyL9.jpg). (Selling the put) Yes it\u2019s small but A) like I mentioned in the post, you cannot go all in. You **cannot** time the bottom. Buy a couple and average down when it goes against you. \n\n[Credentials](https://i.imgur.com/qFDQt0f.jpg)", "created_utc": 1589909316.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gmt28o/dd_hop_onto_the_spce_train_before_it_is_too_late/", "is_self": true}
