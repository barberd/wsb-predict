Buy puts on $RCL , NCLH, CCL.", "selftext": "As the title says, Trump recommended to vacation in-land this summer, and also said that these type of companies WILL get hurt, meaning they will still go down even more. RCL I know that they have canceled March trips, and were looking if to cancel April's. I believe that there is a big chance that this will fall down harder the whole year. He also mentioned that the spread of the Covid-19 is not inevitable, and a shot, like the flu shot, as said by NIH, might take about 1 and a half years. \n\nI highly recommend to buy puts on these companies, for they travel outside, are a luxury, and have a bad reference with Japan that had a ship stuck in quarantine. I'm YOLOing on RCL, made 150% today with 21 next Friday's puts, but sold and bought March 26, 72 contract 52p", "created_utc": 1582765159, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fa3t0p/president_trump_just_recommended_to_vacation_in/", "is_self": true}
