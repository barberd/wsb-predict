After getting fucked buying SPY &amp; FXI puts 3 weeks ago, I tried again last week, and bought AAPL, NVDA and AMD puts as downside protection for my portfolio.\n\nAs you can see going from [here](https://i.imgur.com/Kgw3jLE.png) to [here](https://i.imgur.com/9Z5I4sZ.png), I'm up 3-4x on my puts. I bought basically 10% out of the money thinking it was a good hedge if everything went tits up. However everything is now in the money (except for NVDA).\n\nI'm long on the big semis (TSM, NVDA, AMD etc) in shares so my portfolio value has stayed pretty constant which is what I wanted.\n\nAnyway my question is, do I roll these puts over to further OTM puts? Just don't worry about it? I want downside protection but want to maximise gains if things keep crashing.\n\nTl;Dr: Roll over puts to further OTM or just shut the fuck up?", "created_utc": 1582682375, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9llwp/i_need_some_advice_downside_protection_on_semis/", "is_self": true}
