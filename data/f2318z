As I was about to hang up he said that my windows protection plan expired and I had to extend for another year. He told me to send payment by Western Union.\n\nSo I go to Western Union and the place was fucking empty. As I walk in I realize... something fishy is going on... who the fuck uses Western Union anymore! \n\nSeriously who uses Western Union?! Have you used it? When? Why? \n\nMajority of their customers are undocumented immigrants who send money to their families in South America. They work on thin margins and they have physical locations! Wtf. With online money transfers WU is losing their market share.\n\nLong story short they\u2019re reporting earnings tomorrow.
