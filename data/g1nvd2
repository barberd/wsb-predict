Why? Transaction fee\u2019s are their main form of income! unless they received external funding.\n\nMy guess :\nBecause the Fed is paying them to hold them in one place, and release ALL newbie investors with their stimulus check into a bull rally because they think they\u2019re too late.\n\nWhen this happens, the market will rise, and will crash right after people blow their full stimulus checks on stocks. and people will be even more broke than they were.\n\n\nIs this what is actually happening?\nI dont know, but i wouldn\u2019t be surprised with the Fed doing what its always doing, manipulating and cheating.\n\nThis is just a thought/shitpost that popped into my head the other night, but it would make sense.\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your thoughts.", "created_utc": 1586938744.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1nvd2/online_brokers_are_working_for_the_fed/", "is_self": true}
