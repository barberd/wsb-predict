Banks are pumping billions of dollars into and out of funds with \u201cheartbeat\u201d trades.", "selftext": "One day last September an unidentified trader pumped more than $3 billion into a tech fund run by State Street Corp. Two days later that trader pulled out a similar amount.\n\nWhy would someone make such a large bet\u2014five times bigger than any previous transaction in the fund\u2014and then reverse it so quickly? It turns out that transfusions like these are tax dodges, carried out by the world\u2019s largest asset managers with help from investment banks. The beneficiaries are the long-term investors in exchange-traded funds. Such trades, nicknamed \u201cheartbeats,\u201d are rampant across the\u00a0$4 trillion U.S. ETF market, with more than 500 made in the past year. One ETF manager calls them the industry\u2019s \u201cdirty little secret.\u201d\n\nTypically, when you sell a stock for more than you paid, you owe tax on the gain. But thanks to a quirk in a\u00a0Nixon-era tax law, funds can avoid that tax if they use the stock to pay off a withdrawing fund investor. Heartbeats come into play when there isn\u2019t an exiting investor handy. A fund manager asks a friendly bank to create extra withdrawals by rapidly pumping assets in and out.\n\n\u201cIf the IRS were looking at it, they would say that\u2019s a sham transaction,\u201d says Peter Kraus, a former chief executive officer of mutual fund manager AllianceBernstein Holding LP who now runs Aperture Investors LLC.\n\nImagine that a grocer got a tax deduction every time someone returned a box of cornflakes to his store. Heartbeats are when the grocer asks a friend to buy all the boxes and return them, just to pocket more deductions.\n\n Fund managers and bankers say the trades are perfectly legal, and that most of the taxes that they help regular ETF investors avoid will be paid in later years. The biggest ETF managers, including BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard Group, all use heartbeats, with help from banks such as Bank of America, Credit Suisse Group, and Goldman Sachs Group, according to market participants who spoke on condition of anonymity. Spokesmen for those companies either declined to comment on the trades or defended their use. The Internal Revenue Service says it\u2019s aware of heartbeats and wouldn\u2019t say whether it considers them an abuse.\n\nTo people in the industry, heartbeats are just smart tax strategy. \u201cIt\u2019s removing a negative from the investment process,\u201d says Bruce Bond, a pioneering ETF executive who was among the first regular users of heartbeat trades. \u201cThere really isn\u2019t a need to have to pay the tax every year. The goal is the best investor experience you can have.\u201d\n\nTo understand heartbeats, it helps to know that they\u2019re just a supersize version of something ETFs do every day. ETFs are funds whose shares trade all day on stock exchanges. Unlike mutual funds, ETFs aren\u2019t sold directly to regular investors. Instead, they use banks and brokerage firms as middlemen. These large traders don\u2019t transact in cash. They make an ETF bigger or smaller by adding portfolio stocks to it, or by taking them out. They call this activity \u201ccreating\u201d and \u201credeeming\u201d ETF shares. (All this is invisible to small investors, who just buy ETFs from brokers.)\n\nEnter the Nixon-era tax law. In 1969,\u00a0Congress decreed\u00a0that mutual funds can hand over appreciated stocks to withdrawing investors without triggering a tax bill. Lawmakers never explained why they blessed the industry with this unique break, but back then, it didn\u2019t seem like much of a giveaway. Mutual funds rarely took advantage of it, because their investors preferred cash payouts.\nFast forward to 1993, when American Stock Exchange executives\u00a0devising the first U.S. exchange-traded fund\u00a0realized they could put that old tax rule to a new use. Say an ETF needs to get rid of a stock that went up. Selling it would trigger a taxable gain that would ultimately be paid by fund investors. But handing the stock off to a broker who\u2019s making a withdrawal achieves the same goal, tax-free. Every time a broker redeems a stake in a fund, it\u2019s another chance to avoid taxes. That loophole gives ETFs a tax advantage over mutual funds. It went from a footnote in the tax code to the cornerstone of a new industry.\nFor some of the earliest ETFs, which followed broad indexes such as the S&P 500 and rarely changed holdings, the daily process of brokers creating and redeeming was enough to wash away almost all capital gains. The first and largest ETF, State Street\u2019s SPDR S&P 500 ETF, hasn\u2019t reported a taxable gain in 22 years. In contrast, a traditional mutual fund run by Fidelity Investments that tracks the same index had a taxable gain in 10 of those years.\n\nETFs proliferated, and some new entrants shuffled their holdings more frequently, so routine redemptions weren\u2019t always enough to wipe out the taxes. The PowerShares funds, co-founded by Bond, started trading in 2003 and changed their portfolios every three months. He says his funds wouldn\u2019t have kept capital-gains taxes away without heartbeats. \u201cThis tool was there,\u201d says Bond, who sold PowerShares to Invesco Ltd. and now runs Innovator Capital Management LLC in Wheaton, Ill. \u201cWe were the ones to first really utilize it to its full potential.\u201d\nU.S. stock ETFs avoided tax on more than $211 billion in gains last year, according to a Bloomberg Businessweek tally based on annual reports of more than 400 funds. The disclosures don\u2019t show how much of that is from the funds\u2019 routine use of the ETF loophole and how much is from special heartbeat trades that maximize the benefit. But heartbeats certainly contribute billions to the total.\nFunds pass taxable gains along to their investors, so by avoiding those gains, they\u2019re allowing investors to defer the tax until they sell the ETF itself. The $211 billion in avoided fund gains probably translates to about $23 billion in deferred taxes last year. It\u2019s the equivalent of a $23 billion, no-interest loan from the U.S. Treasury to ETF investors, with most of the benefit going to the\u00a0wealthiest Americans.\nHeartbeats have had a few nicknames over the years, including \u201cfriendlies,\u201d but they haven\u2019t attracted much attention outside the industry. Elisabeth Kashner, an ETF specialist at FactSet Research Systems Inc., was the first to write about the practice in a\u00a0December 2017 report. She called them heartbeats because the telltale blips in fund-flow data on her computer screen reminded her of a cardiac monitor. Bloomberg Businessweek identified 2,261 such blips in equity ETFs since 2000. Last year there were 548, worth a record $98 billion.\n\nMost heartbeats take place when an ETF has to get rid of stock because of a change in the index it tracks. That was the case in September with State Street\u2019s $23 billion\u00a0Technology Select Sector SPDR. Some of the fund\u2019s largest holdings, including Facebook Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc.,\u00a0were being dropped\u00a0from the portfolio because they were leaving the index the fund is designed to mimic. Both stocks had more than doubled since the fund first acquired them, so it probably faced a hefty tax bill if it sold them.\nOn Wednesday, Sept. 19, two days before the index change, $3.3 billion of new assets poured in, increasing the fund\u2019s size by 14 percent. The additions came in the form of stock that matched the fund\u2019s holdings at the time. The investor\u2019s identity wasn\u2019t disclosed, but market participants say that, given the size of the transaction, it was probably a large investment bank.\nOn Friday of that week, someone pulled more than $3 billion back out. Trading data suggest it was the same investor that had appeared two days before. Rather than take back the same shares of stock it had contributed 48 hours earlier, the investor appears to have walked away with the fund\u2019s oldest shares of Facebook and Alphabet, the ones with the biggest capital gains. Thanks to winnings on stocks like that, the fund reported more than $4 billion in capital gains for the year. But since it used the ETF tax loophole to shield those gains from taxes, its annual report shows, it ended up reporting a $309 million capital loss to the IRS.\n\nSource:- https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2019-etf-tax-dodge-lets-investors-save-big/", "created_utc": 1588044263.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9fny2/the_etf_tax_dodge_is_wall_streets_dirty_little/", "is_self": true}
