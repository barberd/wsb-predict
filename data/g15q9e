We are all gathered here on WSB in pursuit of the elusive tendie. Amid FDs, quadruple digit gains, and total account wipeouts it\u2019s easy to lose track of what\u2019s really going on. The higher the numbers get, the more they lose their meaning. \n\nIf you have recently gotten very lucky (or unlucky!) in the stock market, I encourage you to pause. \n\nDid you recently make big gains because you accidentally bought AMZN calls instead of puts? Congratulations! Before plowing it all into MU 80 4/17s, think about the difference that amount makes to you. Think about the fun things you can buy for yourself and enjoy, or how you can make your life or that of your loved ones a little bit more pleasant. Turn those numbers on the screen into something tangible, and make sure to actually enjoy derive enjoyment from them.\n\nDid you lose 150% of your account because you thought a global pandemic should negatively affect stock prices? I\u2019m very sorry to hear that. \u201cThey\u2019re just numbers on a screen\u201d is a trite saying, but it\u2019s also true on a fundamental level. Take this moment to count your blessings, your health, your family, your friends, your (hopefully) relatively comfortable status, your knowledge and your education. Things will improve. \n\nI\u2019m a big proponent of putting yourself and your generosity out there in the world, and I believe that doing so will be rewarded. What goes around comes back around. \n\n**I invite you all to join me today. If you comment on this thread with a donation receipt to any cause (any at all) that is dear to your heart, I will add my own USD 5 donation to that charity.** \n\nIn recent months, WSB has had a tide in which donations are posted and celebrated by the community. Let\u2019s keep that momentum going and being awesome. \n\nLove, \n\nA degenerate \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tjzszzmless41.png?width=812&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ced5900f5eee55dd2f1a3e8d28d6865a2461e82", "created_utc": 1586871683.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g15q9e/got_lucky_in_the_stock_market_giving_back/", "is_self": true}
