But some of us didn't have the balls to buy puts, because who knew how long this preposterous bubble, fueled by amateur investors saying to themselves \"hey, everyone's using Zoom! They must be raking it in!\"\n\nWe knew this was bullshit because ZM is currently trading at a P/E ratio of nearly two-thousand. TWO THOUSAND. Even if you don't believe in any sort of fundamental analysis, you can see that that's fundamentally ridiculous (see what I did there?)\n\nIt's ridiculous because Zoom has no way of ever making money. They offer a product\u2013video conferencing\u2013which people don't expect to pay for, in the long run. Facebook announced on Friday that they're going to be rolling out FREE video conferencing for up to 50 people, and you don't even need to have a FB account to use it. Expect Google to join the party soon. \n\nThe only reason companies currently pay for Zoom is because it's the 'professional' way to video chat. FB won't change that, but something clever linked to Gmail will. (Something better than hangouts, obvs). FB and Google will be able to give this service away for free. Zoom has no other products. \n\nZoom has no stickiness - this isn't a social network folks. There's no need to acquire this company. People have zero loyalty to it. Businesses aren't integrated with Zoom with an API or something. They just pay a middling 25$ per user fee. Everyone will drop this in a second if there's something better and free. \n\nThe stock dropped dramatically on Friday when FB made the announcement. This week everybody is going to realize everything I just wrote. \n\nZM back to the price it was pre-corona\u2013around 60\u2013by June.", "created_utc": 1587993445.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g90idb/the_zoom_bubble_is_popping/", "is_self": true}
