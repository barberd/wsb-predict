This is a cost of generating cap gains, so I want to deduct it somewhere.\n\nGreen's Trader Tax Guide says I should itemize it on line 16 on my Schedule A, but from what I have read in the Schedule A instructions given by the IRS, I'm not sure it belongs there.\n\nThis is a reminder to everyone here to elect Tax Trader Status with the IRS by April 15th so you don't need to deal with this bullshit in 2019.
