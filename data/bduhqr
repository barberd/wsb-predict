If UNIT keeps the lease, the stock should skyrocket (to 15 to 20).\n\nRisks.  Win rejects lease agreement to renegotiate or they take the 90 day extension to determine the leases fate.\n\nI bought 15 contracts at 12.50 expiring Friday.  $300 is worth the risk for ~2-10k to me.\n\nNot a recommendation.
