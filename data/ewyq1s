After finding out I will be a representative of Chile, I have decided that I want to the economy of Chile to be one of the biggest in the world so here\u2019s my game plan. Submit a proposal to ban or sanction the sale of copper from basically every single country except Chile. Since Chile is the biggest exporter of Copper in the world and the supply will be cut the price of copper will rise until Chile has almost a near monopoly on it. Then we raise the price on copper to Skreli level heights and turn the great nation of Chile into a global superpower. I am hoping that no other representatives realize my plan for a new world order created by Chilean Copper. I will make the excuse that all these other nations are using child labor and create a moral panic. Can you give me pictures of children working in copper mines from every other country that exports copper so I can show the travesty of the conditions that these people work in and then show them the safety and security of Chilean Copper miners? Please Autists I need your help. Chile needs your help. We are gonna bring market manipulation to new heights.", "created_utc": 1580520953, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ewyq1s/model_un_and_why_chile_needs_your_help/", "is_self": true}
