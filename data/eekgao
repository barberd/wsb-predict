{"id": "eekgao", "title": "$SPY is falling below 285 next year", "selftext": "I'm usually bear/theta gang but I would be foolish to think that this rally will continue. Sure, we might still go forward for a couple of months, but hear me out:\n-US Corporate profits have been stagnant for about two years, with no significant growth, yet the market is still going up to levels completely unrelated. This is very similar to the bubble of the late 1990s/early 2000s, where the the S&amp;P 500 was pumping but profits were flat. Usually profits growth go on par with stock growth but this time they are completely different, and Everytime there is an asymmetry there will be a correction\n-The FED has successfully pumped the market this year with lots of liquidity, and stocks are WAY overbought. Since September of 2018 the S&amp;P 500 index macrotrends have been pegged to the Global Liquidity Index. \nThere is no way this rally is going to last, volatility will rise again to pretty high level (especially with election year)\nI'm not saying to turn full bear autist and buy naked puts FDs, but BE CAREFUL, because when the big correction kicks in you could get fucked. And the correction in pretty likely to kick in, most likely in spring or summer.\nOverall forecast say that we'll have a moderately red year.\nI'm thinking about switching to Gold and Oil futures options this year for my theta since the forecasts are good (OPEC will continue to cut production and gold could hit 2K), and when stonks go down that shit is going to the moon.", "created_utc": 1577106766, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eekgao/spy_is_falling_below_285_next_year/", "is_self": true}
