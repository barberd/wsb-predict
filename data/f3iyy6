I am going to do things a little different tonight as I have two different drops for everyone.\n\nFirst, the RSI dynamic issue has been fixed. It is now 100% dynamic, even the stock name will update when you change the ticker.\n\nSecond, this added searching and a few tweaks on the singular analysis page means that this spreadsheet is struggling to keep up with the calculations. Thus this release will be the last until the app. I will release my writeup of how everything works on Monday 2/17, and my video of how the spreadsheet is made on 2/22. Since we cannot stop here and there is more to put on the sheets, the app will have an alpha on 3/1. Beta on 3/13. And full release 4/1.\n\nNow time for the good stuff:\n\n**MAKE A COPY**\n\nv6:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/133p4F\\_\\_-695wAKUzcD-9vht8oot77K3f2IuTmBiUZHY/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/133p4F__-695wAKUzcD-9vht8oot77K3f2IuTmBiUZHY/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nV6 speed, it has less on the watch list but is over 60% faster:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H3xdLzA0Sk7sPrfmiFEUhv-ReAGg5iqMNMR\\_jOSKI5A/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H3xdLzA0Sk7sPrfmiFEUhv-ReAGg5iqMNMR_jOSKI5A/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you have a bad PC use the speed version as it will load faster. \n\nAlso, sorry about the loss of some tendies today for some of you, but hopefully they will be returned very soon. Think of it as a stock market loan with high interest ;)\n\nGL", "created_utc": 1581636371, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3iyy6/did_someone_say_v6_and_v6s/", "is_self": true}
