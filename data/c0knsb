Now, what if I sell deep out of the money puts every week or so? In the best case, the ETF doesn\u2019t tank and I pocket the premium, and in worst case, I end up having to buy an ETF at a marginally higher price but it\u2019s an ETF. It was at that price at some point, and it\u2019ll most likely rebound eventually and I won\u2019t gamble away half of my money on MU calls.\n\nAm I retarded?", "created_utc": 1560522116, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c0knsb/selling_deep_out_of_the_money_covered_puts_on_etfs/", "is_self": true}
