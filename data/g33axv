Didn't expect a pop this soon but I'll take the opportunity for profit.\n\nFirst:\n\n* Yes, this pop was unwarranted\n* Yes, Adam F should be investigated\n* Yes, the leaked meeting with the study investigators aren't conclusive\n\nBut for all of you put holders buying in today looking for GILD to tank, you are truly fucking retarded. I'm retarded too. But need I remind you, that GILD is still on track to report their results from Hubei[ this month](https://www.gilead.com/stories/articles/an-open-letter-from-our-chairman-and-ceo-april-10) and that was reaffirmed by the CEO 7 days ago.\n\n4/17 puts aren't a bad idea, 4/24 is risky. But any of you buying puts in May or further out: whenever GILD drops their data from Hubei, you are absolutely fucked.\n\nFor the naysayers that say remdesivir won't matter for GILD's bottom line: **it doesn't fucking matter**. Look at the market right now. Nothing makes sense. Why is ZM 40bil? What about SPCE? Look -- potential future profit doesn't not matter right now, just hype and time in the limelight.\n\nFor the naysayers that say the results won't be good based on anecdotal evidence: **it doesn't fucking matter**. I'm in the pharma industry, and let me spell it out for you guys right now in capitalized bold italics:\n\n***THE ONLY THING MATTERS: WILL THE DATA BE GOOD ENOUGH TO SUPPORT REGISTRATION/FDA APPROVAL***\n\nAnd it's a fucking yes because you guys that know nothing about the FDA approval process are missing 1 key factor: unmet need. There has never been more massive unmet need. People may be recovering and the spread may be tapering off, but countries will be stockpiling this for years and possibly over a decade. I'll also say this may be the only time in history the FDA doesn't even care about safety anymore. Any hint of slight efficacy and it's a straight approval. They absolutely need a FDA-approved drug for therapy with RCT results backing it up. We just saw GILD pop to near 90 based off a leaked video of study investigators shooting the shit for fucks sake. GILD WILL hit 90-100 off the results and FDA approval, and so I'm buying back in once this train on GILD dies down.\n\nTldr: GILD 4/17 82.5p or 80p, go 4/24 if you're feeling lucky. Avoid all puts after April or you'll be betting against the company data release hitting in the next 1.5 weeks.", "created_utc": 1587134589.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g33axv/a_warning_to_gild_put_fomoers_avoid_may_puts/", "is_self": true}
