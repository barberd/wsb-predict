It focuses on the events between 1928-1937, which includes the events leading up the US Great Depression and after, and is contrasted to the events leading up to and happening now. I chose this particular time period as Ray Dalio has explicitly stated in [modern interviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrxYhv2O3wU) that we are entering a New World which resembles the era in which that last one occurred. After reading his amazing book \u201cPrinciples\u201d and seeing how he is pretty much the Steve Jobs of economics, I wanted to learn more about his thoughts and opinions about the effects of the Corona Virus on the economy.\n\nWhat follows is my belief about the future, drawing on the wisdom of Ray Ralio. \\[***\\*My personal side comments are written as such and reflect on the parallels between then and now in 2020\\****\\] I will continue to monitor the news and markets with my primitive tools, relying mostly on my mind and ability to think critically. I will offer a few suggestions and thoughts at the end for how to prepare for what may come.\n\nThank you, and God Speed.\n\n1927-1929: The Bubble || \\[***\\*2017-2019\\****\\]\n\n[The charts above show the explosion in margin debt through the bubble between 1927-1930 and the accompanying rise in prices.](https://preview.redd.it/0ac0t06icry41.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=02fe7b7c241e14314f014d6ffaa6f052957bd7ec)\n\nAfter WWI \\[***\\*The economic equivalent of our 2008-2009 Financial Crisis\\****\\] the economy experienced rapid technological growth with radio and automobile growth \\[***\\*Internet-Of-Things growth\\****\\] leading the charge. Technological innovations happened across many other sectors as well. Technological breakthroughs filled the newspapers, driving wide-spread optimism about the economy.\n\nDebt growth was approximately in line with income growth because it was being used to finance activities that produce fast income growth.\n\nThen a bubble began to emerge. As is classic, the bubble had its roots in the dizzying productivity and technological gains of the period and people making leveraged bets that they would continue.\n\nNew buyers flooded the market, many of them were unsophisticated investors with no prior experience with stocks, one of the classic signs of a bubble. \\[***\\*Recall that brokerages have been competing for household investors by lowering commission fees since 2012, and now most, if not all, brokerages offer zero dollar commission; such as Robin Hood\\****\\] Household margin debt was fueling the bubble. \\[***\\*Recall that the 2008-2009 Financial Crisis bubble was fueled by housing market debt, and the 2020 bubble is being fueled by debt.\\****\\]\n\n1929 (late): The Top and the Crash || \\[***\\*2019 - 2020 (early)\\****\\]\n\nThe Federal Reserve started to tighten monetary policy, hoping to slow the growth of speculative credit without crippling the economy, it raised the interest rate to 6%.\n\n[25 year chart of the federal interest rate.

After the Financial Crisis of 2008, rates were held near 0% to stimulate economic growth. The interest rate was 1.75% prior to the Crash of 2020, the only place to go now is negative interest rates, should the Fed decide on that\\****\\] As loans became more costly and holding cash became more attractive than holding longer duration and/or riskier financial assets (such as bonds, equities, and real estate), money moved out of financial assets causing them to fall in value. Declining asset prices created a negative wealth effect, which fed on itself in the financial markets and fed back into the economy through declining spending and incomes.\n\nThe Bubble reversed into a bust. \\[***\\*February 20, 2020: The top of  2020 crash, only this time slightly different as it was in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and an oil price war between Russia and the OPEC, and the Federal interest rate was only at 1.75% instead of 6%\\****\\]\n\nThe Federal Reserve attempted to counter the collapse in credit by providing liquidity to the markets. The Fed announced it would inject $100M to ease the credit crunch by purchasing government securities. \\[***\\****[April 16, 2020: Federal Reserve Announces Municipal Liquidity Facility](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/covid-19-update-federal-reserve-announces-municipal-liquidity-facility?fbclid=IwAR1EDGksoce8WfbDcSEFZD0ByGBS2dDXXPBzwVh02VO5sEehZkLROea9i2M) ***(the \u201cMLF\u201d) and Under the MLF, a Federal Reserve Bank will commit to lend funds to a special purpose vehicle (the \u201cSPV\u201d), on a full-recourse basis and secured by all assets of the SPV.
