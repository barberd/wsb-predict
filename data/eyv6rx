Or the meme of a BYND. Or the parabolics of TSLA. \n\nMy #1 traded stock, meaning the stock I'm most consistently right about, is TTD. Yeah kind of an outlier  a weird one perhaps, but for some reason I like it. It's large spread is inefficient which often leads to being able to buy lower on the spread and sell higher, especially in the morning. \n\nNow to the point of this post. First, what's your #1 traded stock and why? Second, TTD has had a huge day today, but I don't think it's over for the week. It's been stuck in a trading range around 268-287, with 292 being pretty hard resistance. It has surpassed resistance handily today and I believe by end of week it'll be $320+. I've seen in the past when TTD catches fire it usually has multiple $15-$20 days in a row.  Just a heads up if anyone wants to get in on it.", "created_utc": 1580843386, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eyv6rx/my_1_traded_stock/", "is_self": true}
