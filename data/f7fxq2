First, my condolences for your wrecked profiles on this bloody Friday but it's time to get in the green boys.\n\nIMAX shares are down over $2.25 this month and that is RIGHT AFTER they beat earning expectations this week. After the announcement, shares rose 4% and went up to $17.30. Buy in now, it's already back to being sub $17 and all of their Chinese locations are closed right now thanks to Corunna (which is over half their total theaters). How do you think those earnings are going to look next earnings report? Here a blip from their earning reports earlier this week:\n\n*\"As it pertains to our business, the safety of our employees and Chinese audiences remains our top priority. IMAX China and IMAX Corporation strongly supported the decision to postpone the release of the Chinese New Year film slate and closure of the theaters across the country. Since January 24, more than 70,000 screens, including all of our IMAX screens in Mainland China, have been temporarily closed. We believe it was the best course of action in an unfortunate situation.\"*\n\nOof. 70,000 screens closed currently? That cannot possibly be good for business, yet somehow the stock hasn't dipped very harshly yet. In person experiences such as theaters have the most to lose from this outbreak.\n\nJune 19 puts all cheap at a $15 strike price of 0.60. Get in while the getting is good because this stock is not going to the moon, it is going to the Mariana Trench while our bank numbers go to space.", "created_utc": 1582312165, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7fxq2/puts_on_imax_are_100_on_lock/", "is_self": true}
