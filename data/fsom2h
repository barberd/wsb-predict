{"id": "fsom2h", "title": "Aggressive Options, BAC-CCL-GILD-MGM-TSLA", "selftext": "Today I included the aggressive orders, watch tomorrow which of these orders go into OI then you can tell which of these are sitting open.\n\nThese   options orders are on or above the ask. Many have the same expiry and    strike. Also lots  of the orders were sweeps so these ppl were  breaking down their order to get filled faster.\n\nHere - [https://imgur.com/a/nzRGcsp](https://imgur.com/a/nzRGcsp)\n\nAlso  all these orders volume of the contracts exceeded the open interest   in  multiple trades so it's most likely not closing positions. Either   buy  to open orders or sell to open orders and based on the      aggressiveness  of the orders one can infer its buy to open.  Some of  these may be  hedges and some most likely not.\n\nThe BAC put orders are already in the money (ITM) mostly, so unsure about those. The orders that seem really aggressive is the GILD orders. I assume because of their drug for the beer virus. CCL is a no brainer but the IV is too high I think. MGM had aggressive unusual calls for the 13 calls for 05/15. Those seem to be a directional bet. So TSLA had put orders but it's hard to tell as tsla moves like a penny stock.\n\nDon't   just  enter YOLO's in positions based on this data alone in most cases.   Use   technicals/fundamentals/options data/market feelings all combined    instead of just 1 of these.   Use protection like spreads if you worry    about losing what u put in and be  smart, understand the risks of  putting $ into weekly expiry's, consider a longer expiry. Learn IV AND IV CRUSH!!\n\nAlso with the market going lower use technicals/fundamentals/options  data-flow all combined.\n\nEDIT    - Wanted to add, I make these posts a lot with different tickers,  when  I  am most confident I make a whole thread for one ticker. Like I  did  in  the past with MSFT/AAPL/TSLA/DIS, I am saying this because I  have   different levels of confidence the orders will work out. These  orders   today are aggressive but not super super aggressive. So the  confidence   level is lower than something extremely aggressive and  unusual like SBUX order flow I posted about in the past.\n\nEDIT   - We are in uncertain times so these orders have less of an impact. Technicals say there is more room to fall in the indexes so most   companies should follow.", "created_utc": 1585699754.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fsom2h/aggressive_options_baccclgildmgmtsla/", "is_self": true}
