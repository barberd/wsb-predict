{"id": "hbm6ji", "title": "What is going on with Wirecard ?", "selftext": "Let's try to answer this question !\n\n**Who ?**\n\n\u00ab Wirecard is an international supplier of electronic payment and risk management services. Wirecard offers products and services in the areas of [mobile payments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_payment), [e-commerce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce), [digitization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digitization) and finance technology. This traditionally comprises the integration of payment methods, payment transactions via e-commerce as well as payment transactions at the stationary checkout ([POS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_sale)). In these areas, Wirecard currently works in cooperation with 280,000 companies (as of December 2018), including [Allianz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allianz), [KLM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KLM), [Qatar Airways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar_Airways),[Rakuten.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakuten.com) and [Transport for London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_for_London), among others. The transaction volume in 2018 was US$125 billion. In the first half of 2019 the transaction volume grew by 37.5 percent to EUR 77.3 billion. \u00bb Wikipedia\n\n**Shareholders ?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rzpbs9z98q551.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=e65866db19ca77189d307e4f61b528e538b7f374\n\n**Creditors :**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Deutsche Bank took half of Markus shares as a collateral for a loan of 150m \u20ac to Markus not Wirecard\n\n**Market share ?**\n\nThose are the countries using the most Wirecard :\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wl1tg5xa8q551.png?width=416&format=png&auto=webp&s=69082fc467534b0a127e1d42deefff048a4a9824\n\nMarket shares of the European competitors :\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fsz15v5c8q551.png?width=1994&format=png&auto=webp&s=30d876934f7ee8734a3a58f2c219a05e95d9ba0c\n\n*Side note* : Amongst international competitors there arePaypal, Visa, Apple Pay \u2026\n\n**What happened ?**\n\nAll really begun with this 59 pages report written by KPMG ([https://www.wirecard.com/uploads/Bericht\\_Sonderpruefung\\_KPMG\\_EN\\_200501\\_Disclaimer.pdf](https://www.wirecard.com/uploads/Bericht_Sonderpruefung_KPMG_EN_200501_Disclaimer.pdf)) concerning a forensic special investigation on Wirecard, which basically mean that they are investigating about a **specific case** with the aim of fully clarifying a potential (not necessarily criminally relevant) violation or misconduct, so this is not a annual audit.\n\nIn this report, KPMG complained about the lack of will of Wirecard to give informations, KPMG was unable to obtain standard information that it requested from Wirecard such as bank statements, customer names and contracts as well as transaction data.\n\nThis document was the main reason of the Chris Hohn\u2019s open letter. The famous hedge fund manager published an open letter on April 28 to Thomas Eichelmann, the chairman of Wirecard ([https://www.tcifund.com/files/corporateengageement/wirecard/TCI%20-%20Letter%20to%20Wirecard%2028%20April%202020.pdf](https://www.tcifund.com/files/corporateengageement/wirecard/TCI%20-%20Letter%20to%20Wirecard%2028%20April%202020.pdf)).\n\nIn his letter, he states the audit made by KPMG was inconclusive, \u00ab KPMG explains that it has encountered an \u201cUntersuchungshemmnis\u201d (in English: obstacles to the investigation) \u00bb, basically, 1 billion $ was missing between 2016 and 2018. So it raises questions to how investors, lenders and regulators can be confident that Wirecard\u2019s current and historic accounting is accurate, so they wanted for Wirecard to show some trust by firing Markus the CEO, but today he is still here. He concluded by announcing that he was short selling 1.04% of shares outstanding of Wirecard.\n\n**Since then :**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* TILP filed an investor lawsuit. The lawsuit claims that the KPMG report showed that the group for years had experienced a massive shortfall in compliance\u009d that it had been obliged to disclose to shareholders early on. Why is it important ? Because this law firm has already won cases against Porsche and Volkswagen during the diesel gate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Al Alam a Dubai business payment processor their most significant business partner entered liquidation on May 2\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Today the stock dropped 61% and their bonds by more than 40% because EY which was conducting an annual audit said that they were unable to confirm the existence of 2.1b $, and that \u00ab  spurious cash balance \u00bb have been provided to auditor by 3rd party. This missing fund represents 25% of the company. They have to come clean by tomorrow (June 18).\n\n**Conclusion :**\n\nConsidering the online payment business as fast very forward industry, Wirecard is facing two challenges :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* First, they will need to find a managerial equilibrium in a short time\n* Second, they will need earn back trust from current clients and future ones. They may loose more clients in the short term.\n\nThose challenges are actually very hard to tackle in an healthy market but in this one it seems nearly impossible, furthermore, big investors will be selling massively those next few days so we might see more loses.\n\n**I am not a financial advisor but I would say that in the long and short term the stock is going down as well as the company.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT : Forgot positions :\n\n\\- short Wirecard through turbos and warrants if you can,\n\n\\- or 26/06p on $DB, but this one is risky since this is just 100m \u20ac possibly lost.\n\n\\- or more autistic 15/01p on $DB because if they loan to business with shares as collateral, they might be fucked if stocks go down.", "created_utc": 1592511657.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hbm6ji/what_is_going_on_with_wirecard/", "is_self": true}
