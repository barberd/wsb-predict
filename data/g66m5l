I'm trying to understand it.\n\nhttps://www.wisdomtree.eu/en-gb/products/ucits-etfs-unleveraged-etps/commodities/wisdomtree-wti-crude-oil\n\n\"WisdomTree WTI Crude Oil is designed to enable investors to gain an exposure to a total return investment in crude oil by tracking the Bloomberg Crude Oil Subindex (the \"Index\") and providing a collateral yield.\"\n\nI checked this subindex and it tracks oil prices almost 1:1.\n\nCould you also explain difference between ETC and ETF in simple words?
