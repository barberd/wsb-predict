An autist's guide...", "selftext": "I'm not exactly u/SV but I've been doing my research night and day and would like to share; here are the indicators that you retards should be watching for when you need to start crying about betting your trump dollars on spy puts.\n\n[Time Segmented Volume Indicator](https://preview.redd.it/lbmkwqazziq41.png?width=1544&format=png&auto=webp&s=8563d9a9a27cc3e4c87de965a457d8426127d960)\n\nOur first indicator that actually told us the sell off would be beginning is called TSV, it uses volume & time to find tops & bottoms (selling/buying points). This indicator is tried and true and will tell us when a good time to load up on calls would be. The yellow box is the signal and the yellow line is the candle that the signal was triggered on. This is called a leading indicator as it **tells you what most likely will happen before it happens**.**Once the red line crosses back to the green it will be a great time to load up on calls 2-4 weeks out.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[AAII Sentiment Indicator](https://preview.redd.it/m7qrgtmt3jq41.png?width=1831&format=png&auto=webp&s=19c1c42e8051b6ebd22eeb560a490a44baf301d6)\n\nThis is a sentiment indicator, it show the percentage bullish (positive), and bearish (negative). When the market has reached the black line on my chart, which is just an approximation in comparison to other market bottoms like 2018 & 2008, the market is nearing / has already created a bottom. The largest dip in the spy is the 2018 crash which shows how this indicator perfectly timed the bottom. **This is the most important one to watch in my opinion; this will tell you when the big players start turning gay.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Some very technical anal.](https://preview.redd.it/vg1lsgs65jq41.png?width=1681&format=png&auto=webp&s=a74e68f4baeb225d97bea5f4ec52d90c26f79327)\n\nOur last and most important indicator is TA. I know everyone here thinks It is voodoo magic but just some simple moving averages & support / resistance goes a long way and allows for insanely safe entry points for being bullish. Entering when the S&P recovered above the 200MA would've netted 179% nailing a good entry into the most recent bull run & keeping you in your trade through the crashes. This is the simplest way I can show you with TA and it will stay that way unless you guys can handle some more technical analysis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Tits&SkankyVagina, Aderall&AdrenalineII, Technical Anal\n\nI've summed up what I've needed to, as always here is your ticker, strike & date.\n\nSPY 5/1 $200 P\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: As for my gay bear technical analysis :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Gay ](https://preview.redd.it/4fegg6bu8jq41.png?width=1096&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e97619dd07a8a014bedec3c5f6c5fe8dfd41361)\n\nIf we're expecting a move lower, Elliot Wave Theory says that 164 will be our bottom on the next move, I'm hoping for a quick move downward through the lows then a slower trend to $164.", "created_utc": 1585888497.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fu1s7o/has_the_sp_hit_the_bottom_an_autists_guide/", "is_self": true}
