Shows that even intel is worried about AMD catching up to intel.\nhttps://www.techpowerup.com/256842/intel-internal-memo-reveals-that-even-intel-is-impressed-by-amds-progress\nFor the first time you have a CPU lineup that is competitive in all aspects, not only multicore, but also single core. Before, AMD might have only appealed to Budget and workstation users, AMD can appeal to every single part of the market. Leaks show that AMD is either on par, or even beating intel, at a much lower price point. Intel has slashed prices as a result. \n\nOEMs are starting to choose AMD over Intel, as they start seeing cost savings, at no impact to performance.\n\nLaptops, a market traditionally locked down by intel, also facing a rise in AMD based devices.\n\nFinally, servers. Intel makes most of their moolah on servers, where they can jack up the prices because there is no real competition. AMD has also come in, guns blazing, with server chips that are finally worth paying attention to. Google's stadia (game streaming service) is running off of AMD. Fixes to recent CPU vulnerabilities like meltdown, spectre, Rowhammer, all (significantly) affect Intel computing performance, something that enterprise customers care about a lot. AMD has been a lot more uptight about their security.\n\nIntel has a market cap of 200 bil, while AMD has a market cap of 30 bil. AMD is definitely not going to 200 bil, but there is room for growth.\n\nConcerns: P/E ratio of AMD is a little high, 121 vs Intel's 10. Could be a little overpriced, considering how a lot of investors realize the value in AMD. P/E ratio of 40 is normal in semiconductors.\n\nHowever, considering room for future, explosive growth, I think it literally can't go tits up.\n\nLong AMD, price target $60 (if you hold) I'll probably hold for 4 months.\nDisclaimer: I own shares of AMD", "created_utc": 1561783917, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c6uod6/why_long_amd_dd/", "is_self": true}
