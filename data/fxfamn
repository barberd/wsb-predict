I don\u2019t have the cash to manually exercise, but there was a tooltip that told me RH would sell the structure for me if that is the case.\n\nHours pass and I still see the the spread in my portfolio. I try to sell it myself and RH auto-cancels the order a few minutes later. The markets close a while later, and suddenly I have a debit of 25600 on my account, which means it was never sold.\n\nHow fucked am I?", "created_utc": 1586381319.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxfamn/why_did_rh_steal_265k_from_me/", "is_self": true}
