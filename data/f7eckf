Heluva is owned by HP Hood, a private company. No tendies there. So I went to who I think is likely the biggest dip company:\n\n**$PEP - Pepsi.** Since Pepsi purchased Frito-Lays back when your grandfather was dodging the draft, they hold about 40% of the snack market - this includes Lays dips. There is a caveat here - the dip kind of sucks, but since we're told **Buy The Dip** and since they are the biggest seller for some reason...
