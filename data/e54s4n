I\u2019ve been exploring this glitch for years now and racked up a few hundred thousand \ud83d\udcb5 so far. I\u2019ve heard this isn\u2019t limited to my city so it may work for you too. I don\u2019t know how legit it really is though, since I always get a bit less actual money than what I\u2019m promised. \n\nThere\u2019s this \ud83c\udfe2 I go to, about half hour \ud83d\ude99 from my house, and all I have to do is sit around for a few hours, doing some boring tasks that are usually less stressful than watching stocks. Every couple of weeks, a few thousand \ud83d\udcb5 get deposited into my account. This keeps happening as long as I keep showing up. Literally can\u2019t go \ud83c\udf65\ud83c\udf65\u261d\ud83c\udffb. It doesn\u2019t stop! I\u2019m not sure whether they\u2019re aware that I\u2019m making fucking bank from this, but I\u2019m going to keep milking it until they find out about all the money I\u2019m getting.", "created_utc": 1575317798, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e54s4n/found_infinite_money_glitch_irl/", "is_self": true}
