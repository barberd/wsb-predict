{"id": "fw1vjx", "title": "Some TA for all you retards", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\n[The future of the market](https://preview.redd.it/fezfw6b708r41.jpg?width=1507&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b9b32bb4959ea5043843a2b1d5e6da630965c8a7)\n\nSo I know a lot of you think that TA is all useless, but it can give you an edge over the average Joe out there who doesn't understand how the markets work.  Until today, it seemed that we were in a downwards channel as we stayed within its walls even after being tested numerous times.  However, today we broke through in an upwards direction, which signals that we could break off into a bullish upwards trend.  However, until we break through the resistance at about 263, there is no real confirmation.  \n\nIf you look at the volume you can see that there's been a gradual decline in volume which leads me to believe that we could stay within the range of 244 to 263 for a while until we get a break to the downside or upside.  It appears that the market is unsure of which direction to take as it is unsure whether there will be a quick recovery or if we have yet to see the full damage this virus brings.\n\nThus, as a **bear**, today was a defeat of a battle, not the war, but a battle, as we broke the downwards channel, so for the time being it looks like the lowest we will be going is 244 until a major catalyst causes it to break the support to the downside or break the resistance at 263 to the upside.  So as a bear I'd be using today to buy long dated puts if you think that the market will go down more.  Short-dated puts are screwed unless you are playing the 263-244 channel from top to bottom.  Any strike price below 244 better be dated at the very least 5/15, hopefully at least June, or your puts will most likely expire worthless.\n\nFor **theta gang** players, this could be your time to shine.  If we reject the 263 resistance and head downwards, you should sell iron condors with the inside set to 244 and 263 respectively, or sell call credit spreads when we are near the top and put credit spreads when we are near the bottom.  However, a word of warning is that it's unknown how long this sideways action will last.  It's lasted about two weeks, so it could be a while before we break it, but I wouldn't overextend yourself too much.\n\nFor **bull gang**, today was probably the rosiest day you could have hoped for.  Breaking that downwards channel means that at least for now, there won't be a ton of downwards movement in the near future.  244 is likely the lowest we'll go until we get a big enough catalyst to break it.  Even better, there's a possibility we break the 263 resistance!  If so, we should continue up to about 273 until any real resistance presents itself, so buy those calls if we can break 263.   Long term, the war has definitely not been won, and there's still plenty of ammunition on the bears side.  While the bears will retreat and lick their wounds, don't think that they will just roll over and give up that easily.  Be wary of any break of 244 to the downside, as that could signal the next gap down, and the next support won't be until about 218, and might fill quickly, so exit any calls if 244 is broken.\n\nI personally tend to side with theta gang this month and the bears after that, as I believe we will spend a while swinging from 263 to 244 and then below 244 when we realize that this virus indeed has long term impacts on our economy that haven't been priced in.  However, if we break 263 to the upside I must say that, while not the end of the war by any means, that would be a significant victory for bulls and will be a while before we start seeing any real movements down if any at all.\n\n**TLDR:**  Today was a victory for bulls, a defeat for bears, but by no means the end of the war.  Look for breaks above 263 and below 244 to signify where we are headed next.\n\n**Bear positions:**  Long-term / SPY 240p 6/19 or later | short-term / SPY 263p 4/17 sell around SPY 244\n\n**Theta gang:** Iron condor / 243p(buy)-244p(sell) and 263c(sell)-264c(buy) | also sell call credit spreads when SPY approaches 263 and then close them when SPY approaches 244 and sell put credit spreads\n\n**Bull positions:** short-term / SPY 263c 4/17 (for potential break of resistance) or SPY 244c when SPY approaches 244 | long-term / SPY 270c 5/15 or later (if SPY breaks 263 resistance and heads upwards)", "created_utc": 1586190761.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fw1vjx/some_ta_for_all_you_retards/", "is_self": true}
