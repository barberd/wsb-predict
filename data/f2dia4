{"id": "f2dia4", "title": "ROKU Beats", "selftext": "A lot of you seem to be confused on what the fuck ROKU's business model actual is. THEY ARE NOT A HARDWARE COMPANY. ROKU is in the Ad business building a *big, next-generation\u2019 targeted ad platform.*\n\nAs more and more people cut the cable, they will have to turn to ROKU's platform, or should I say 'ecosystems' to stream their favorite cable channels and networks. ROKU will take a % of this and be one of the largest in America, since anyone, anywhere with an internet connection can use roku to stream TV. The primary competitor is not other services on the platform, the primary competitor is linear tv - and ROKU has them beat.\n\n**Let's look at some numbers:**\n\n* Roku sells more dedicated streaming devices than perhaps any other company in the world. It\u2019s been estimated that there are more Rokus in US households than there are Fire TVs, Chromecasts, or Apple TVs. Estimates say 40% of all TV's sold are Roku TV's. \n* If you read through [ROKUs dev SDK](https://developer.roku.com/docs/developer-program/advertising/roku-advertising-framework.md), you'll see they force their channel partners to use *their* ads taking a cut of all profits and subs made by, FOX, Disney+ etc.\n   * *Entertainment firms pay a carriage fee to be on the cable lineup.* Roku has built itself up as an advertising company, getting a cut of the ad revenues from major media partners in exchange for the distribution. \n   * **Roku's 2019 revenues**, **67% of Roku's $1.1 billion in revenues came from ads**. Growing to $1.6 billion in 2020, with the bulk coming\u00a0from advertising again.\u00a0Which amounts to the revenue base more than doubling (111% projected growth rate between 2018-2020.\n* ROKU's CEO went into a [Mexican standoff with FOX](https://amp.usatoday.com/amp/4623654002) and fucking wonn. The guy has balls, ROKU got the superbowl and cucked FOX.\n\n**Guidance:**\n\n* Millions more to cut their 'cable' in 2020 and pick it back up on ROKU enabled devices and TV's\n* ROKU will announce (soon) something with COMCAST \n\n**ROKU beats earnings. Long ROKU.**", "created_utc": 1581449389, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f2dia4/roku_beats/", "is_self": true}
