{"id": "g039j7", "title": "Easter Sunday: tendies for everyone", "selftext": "Ok you \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b\u2026\n\nTomorrow, Monday, is going to be a huge green dildo, so you better start lubing up right now and can thank me later.\n\nLet\u2019s start with when all of this bullshit started. March 3, 2020 \u2013 this is when JPow first turned on his money printer with an Emergency Rate Cut.\n\nMarch 3 also happens to be 40 days before today. What is today? Well, what do you know? Jesus fucking Christ \u2013 he has risen.\n\nSo you ask, what is the importance of 40 days? Well, you see, our main man, JC, he wasn\u2019t eating tendies for 40 days. 40 FUCKING days! He sacrificed himself so that the world wouldn\u2019t have to suffer in hunger and financial pain. He knew that things were going to get bad. The only way was for him to stop eating tendies so all future generations could enjoy tendies.\n\nIf he was successful, the Devil would lose. So during the whole 40 day fasting, JC was constantly being tempted by the Devil. Now this is the part that was omitted from the Bible, so listen carefully\u2026\n\nThe Devil appears and turns stone into tendies. Right in front of JC. BUT! JC is no ordinary chump. He likes to keep the pimp hand strong and has \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c like you\u2019ve never seen before. Instead, he makes a deal with the Devil that, if he forgoes eating these delicious tendies, the Devil would, instead, let JPow turn on his money printer for eternity.\n\nThis is why JPow, who is named after Saint Jerome, and who was initially skeptical of Christianity, eventually converted. And upon learning of the sacrifice that JC made, Saint Jerome devoted his life to JC\u2019s teachings. He led a spiritual life until his death in the year 420 AD.\n\nSo you see, you \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b have been missing the whole point all along. When you were buying puts, you should have been buying calls. You cannot let all this work our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, has sacrificed for us. Today is a reminder of this moment and going forth, you shall, too, enjoy tendies.\n\ntl;dr Jesus Christ died for us to enjoy tendies. JPow was named after Saint Jerome, who died in 420 AD. Today is a reminder and tomorrow is a massive green dildo\n\nSPY 420c 12/25", "created_utc": 1586720447.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g039j7/easter_sunday_tendies_for_everyone/", "is_self": true}
