I personally don't know anyone who's used that service so it's clearly unpopular. But seriously, it's a very limited service as of now and don't believe it will seriously influence this quarter's numbers.\n* I know a lot of gay guys who use it, so the stock has some BECKY potential\n* First quarter to include UK expansion - I don't see why the Beckys there wouldn't like it\n* Expectations for the quarter actually seem pretty low and their revenue growth has been accelerating\n* I kinda remember at some point recently they blew out earnings and spiked up like a ton I think idk can't remember all the details\n\nUnfortunately IV is super high but I will probably buy around 5k in calls (screenshot in comments)", "created_utc": 1569947300, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dbvvbb/sfix_earnings_play/", "is_self": true}
