{"id": "fa8w9m", "title": "Beer Virus Morning Briefing from Germany - THE BEER country", "selftext": "So I did my DD this morning and since german news actually has some facts and we interview scientists and doctors and stuff, I thought you guys might like a brief rundown of what THE beer country thinks of the beer virus.\n\n**Germany:** We have a bunch of new outbreaks, mostly returners from italy and their relatives. Someone posted yesterday already the story of the couple that was sick for 10 days before noticing it and even went to a carnival event. She was a kindergarten teacher and both are very sick now.\n\nThere is also a hospital that is partly being shut down, cause the daughter of the chief doctor was in italy. They are all only showing light symptoms. This is mostly important because doctors getting sick always makes people much more frightened.\n\nThere was also an interview with a local doctor, who said they have trouble sourcing breathing masks and other equipment to stay safe so they are considering closing down their shop when the outbreak hits.\n\nFinally our secretary of health said the pandemic in germany is coming, this is the start of it.\n\n**World:**\n\nBiggest news piece was on Iran. Apparently its a shitshow there, they dont deal with it AT ALL. They keep the official numbers low. There is an ironic video of the vice secretary of health of iran giving a speech about how everything is fine, coughing and sweating himself. Later on, news broke he is infected himself. A german scientist was cited who tried to figure out the real numbers based on deaths reported, infected cases in other contries traveling from Iran etc and he estimated conservatively that they must have close to 20.000 infected (yes thats 25% of what all of china reported). And it is spreading fast to Iraq, kuweit, pakistan etc.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe numbers keep growing a ton. On the same hand, with rising numbers it becomes more and more clear that the mortality is likely way below the 2% they have calculated so far. It also seems to be extremely infectious. Long term impact is completely unknown.\n\nSo basically its the flu but a bit different and that little bit plus the name scares the shit out of people. I personally have gone full bear mode and believe the big drops are yet to come.\n\nI have sold most of my /r/investing portfolio last week monday, basically on the all time high. Now I am waiting for rock bottom to go back in.\n\nIn the meantime I have some playmoney on the typical corona puts that are discussed in this sub (EWJ, EWY, EWG, CCL, BA).\n\nI have no clue about technicals, so I am only playing the game based on the psychology of the masses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL/DR:** Stonks go down, PUTs on everything.", "created_utc": 1582790943, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fa8w9m/beer_virus_morning_briefing_from_germany_the_beer/", "is_self": true}
