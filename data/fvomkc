Wanted to know if you autists and gay gentlemen/ladies have any ideas, and share one of mine.\n\nThis is probably dumb, but here is my idea. I would set up a automated program to seek out and execute vertical positions with probability of success 95%+ and 50%+ profit. I have a theory that very favorable positions quickly open and close within minutes or seconds based on intraday fluctuations between Put Call pricing that can be exploited if you are fast enough. I would want to set up a program that automatically finds those positions within a set list and then closes them after the favorable pricing window closes. Sell the entire portfolio daily. Hold no position longer than a few hours. Rake in tendies. I have no idea how to make that work.\n\nI have always been super curious about arbitrage also if anyone knows about that.\n\nAnyone have experience with executing automated trades? Or want to share ideas?\n\nEDIT: Sorry for the typo in the title.
