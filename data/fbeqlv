Realistically I think we have 2-3 months before transmission rates drop and people start recovering. \n\nThe response by the US has been terrible from an administrative and technical standpoint. The administration has been proposing repeated budget cuts for the CDC, we have Mike Pence leading the team for handling the outbreak (was unable to handle Indiana HIV outbreak, science denier), the White House calling the disease a hoax (false sense of hope for people dumb enough to believe it), without early preventative actions being implemented nothing truly preventative is being done and the disease will get more widespread in the USA. As the fed gets involved we may see a spike monday, but we should see a pretty swift decline once people realize rate cuts won't prevent the disease from halting productivity. \n\nTLDR: It's a bull trap", "created_utc": 1582992971, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fbeqlv/looking_into_next_week/", "is_self": true}
