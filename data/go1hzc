Oh, your mom\u2019s basement doesn\u2019t have windows? No worries, buddy. That\u2019s not why we\u2019re here. Do you know what I see when I look out my window? Farm fields. That\u2019s right. I\u2019m from the Midwest and we have farm fields next to our Walmart\u2019s and McDonald\u2019s. I know, you\u2019re probably thinking how the fuck do my cousins and I have internet out here? Well, the federal government does more than send out Trump bux. They also waste money to build out fiber so people like me can use Internet Explorer to play FarmVille. Since I\u2019m from the Midwest, my IQ is at least half of yours, but since you don\u2019t know the difference between a flood pump and a pivot you need to listen the fuck up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJohn Deere (DE). There\u2019s hardly a more American company. Look at its fucking stock lately. Up, up, up, unlike our Robinhood accounts because  we buy high and sell low. Here's your chance to change that. It *is* considered essential to our infrastructure. Fortunately, the stock can go down and I\u2019m going to tell you why now is the perfect time to make money on it doing so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet\u2019s start with the basics. Everyone knows daddy Trump is playing hardball with China, and it\u2019s fucked our farmers, but they still eat their TV dinner meals glued to Fox News in their MAGA hats and confederate flag snuggies. John Deere took some beating because of that last year. Things started to look up when a new deal was recently signed. Surprise, [China hasn\u2019t lived up to their agreement](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wsj.com/amp/articles/china-ramping-up-purchases-of-u-s-farm-goods-11589886003) and they\u2019re purchasing less than they agreed to. On top of that, the people that should love ole DE the most have been battling with them on the [Right to Repair](https://www.powernationtv.com/post/farmers-are-having-to-fix-tractors-themselves-due-to-repair-ban) shenanigans. Now, I know you feel like a hacker when you sneak onto your mom\u2019s Facebook account, but ole John is treating farmers like they are actually hacking shit when they try to fix their own equipment. Brand loyalty is starting to diminish.  \n\n\nAnd some financials. They have earnings release tomorrow 10am. Options are still cheap with low IV. They withdrew their guidance for this year. [They\u2019re expected to report a $1.99 EPS](https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/932976/deere-de-to-report-q2-earnings-whats-in-the-offing) which is nearly a 50% drop YOY. My hypothesis is smart money is getting out and that's why the price has been rising. I also have an IQ of a corn stalk so what the fuck do I know? Before the pandemic happened they were already seeing drops in revenue. They have some cash. I'm far far from an expert so this shit may be totally incorrect, but [Q1 showed $3 billion](https://s22.q4cdn.com/253594569/files/doc_financials/2020/q1/de_Current-Folio_10Q_MBSF_ActiveHyperlinks_V3-(1).pdf). But they also have a metric fuck ton of debt. Oh just something to the tune of nearly $60 fucking billion. It\u2019s going to start to get pretty fucking hard to service that debt as income shrinks further. Not to mention, $27 billion of their assets is in financing receivables. As we begin to see farms and dealers belly up in the coming months and can\u2019t pay their loans, those assets aren\u2019t going to be much of an asset anymore.  \n\n\nAnd finally, blah blah past performance doesn\u2019t equal future shit. But look what happened to DE the previous two recessions:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mhysmdpel5051.png?width=1472&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f6d2a9d69a9716ac519055ceb494457abf2bcfe\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yf5o5cuhl5051.png?width=1483&format=png&auto=webp&s=b62e7c4d72843dea2673cafe7592b28754b18b59\n\nFuck me those are some big drops. Obviously DE is a good long-term play. They\u2019re too big to fail. You can still make money on the near-term drop as everything goes to shit. But don\u2019t take financial advice from a 75 IQ Midwesterner who isn't even a fucking farmer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can\u2019t count, much less time drops, so I bought leaps: 1/15/2021 $75p  \nLet me know if you make tendies with shorter dated plays.", "created_utc": 1590083171.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/go1hzc/john_deere_and_your_chance_to_harvest_some_gains/", "is_self": true}
