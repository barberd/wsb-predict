AG Bill Barr certainly isn't going to all of a sudden have a change-of-heart and say we shouldn't be prosecuting anyone anymore. \n\nThese private-prison companies are going to get absolutely destroyed with virus outbreaks not just in the United States, but in all the other prisons around the world they operate. The Fed can't stop outbreaks with their printing machines. \n\n$GEO 9 4/17", "created_utc": 1585242706.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpfbih/prisons_are_gonna_put_out/", "is_self": true}
