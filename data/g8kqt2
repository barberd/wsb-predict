Boeing walked away from Embraer deal --> Leaving them a excess cash flow of net 4.5 billion usd.\n2. CEO has just announced that they have 15 billion USD net cash flow sitting in the bank.\n3. Have major contracts such as Airforce defence, military, and as well as flying jets. Commercial flying, and traveling wont ever decrease, currently it will start to pick up as more and more countries are due to open next week or next month.\n4. Shifts in the major leaderships positions will help boeing furthermore.\n5. Have not applied for any federal aid, because per CEO, have enough cash flow to maintain their business expenditures.\n\nThink long term, if the stock that has plummeted 3.5x from the highs, i dont think there is massive downside, but massive upside for sure.\n\nMany companies has recovered already, this is the only cheap stock present currently in market, money will eventually flow into more \"down stocks\" than already recovered.", "created_utc": 1587929453.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g8kqt2/here_is_why_boeing_stock_may_ascend_into_160190/", "is_self": true}
