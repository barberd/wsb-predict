{"id": "hfqyf4", "title": "STX Alert - Hop on in boys!", "selftext": "Hey tards, \n\nGot an update that STX has \"unusual options activity.\"   \n\nTurns out that STX had 4,531 calls traded, 2x more than usual, and implied vol increasing over 7 points to 48.46%. Jan-21 37.5 calls and 7/10 weekly 54 calls are the most active options, with total volume in those strikes near 900 contracts. Now, I don't know what all those words mean exactly but I think we can all agree on one thing: \"I bEt ItS a HeDgE!\" \n\nBut really, who has time to think when people are just slingin' STX 48C 7/02 \n\nAnyway, 30 minutes after buying I thought to myself \"wait, what the fuck does STX even do...\"\n\nSo just to be safe, I decided to pretend to care about how I lose my money. First things first, if I'm buying calls I follow my golden TSLA rule, check to see if the underlying company makes money. I don't want to be a dumbass and waste my time on a company that actually has earnings like some type of boomer fuckboi. Turns out STX makes earnings...and a dividend...man I feel gay right now. \n\nSo naturally and because I'm a straight bull Chad, I panic. I decide to frantically research what banks and anal-ysts think because I  like having other people lie to me. Turns out Fidelity thinks that STX is \"undervalued\" and that people say its a buy. Sounds like something those retards would say...\n\nAnyways, I'm going to hold until I'm rich or they are worthless. Don't have much else going on....", "created_utc": 1593108437.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hfqyf4/stx_alert_hop_on_in_boys/", "is_self": true}
