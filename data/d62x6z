{"id": "d62x6z", "title": "MoviePass is officially dead.", "selftext": "The Robinhood snacks has some nice shade going their way. \"Peak insanity\" was used and I loved it.\n\nFor those on a real terminal:\n\nAct I - Irrelevance:\u00a0Founded in 2011, MoviePass offered a $40/month subscription that let you into any theater to watch any movie.\u00a0Worth it only for the very lonely and movie-crazy.\n\nAct II - The new guy in town:\u00a0Mitch Lowe was hired as CEO. There were only 20K customers, so he cut the price by 75%.\n\nAct III - Peak insanity:\u00a0At $10/month, the breakeven price for MoviePass was 1 movie per month, so people signed up. 3M people binged 5% of all movies watched in late 2018.\n\nAct IV - The reckoning:\u00a0Theaters still charged full price for each ticket, forcing MoviePass to pay the difference \u2014 and lose $21M/month (\"Amazon lost money for 20 years\" \u2014\u00a0the CEO). So it had to raise prices/add a bunch of restrictions.\n\nAct V - This Saturday:\u00a0It's over. The parent company doesn't know when or if it will come back.\n\nPost-credit scene:\u00a0Globo-theater-chain\u00a0AMC\u00a0now offers something like MoviePass.
