The Xbox Series X may play a big role in this because of the following:\n\n&gt;Edge computing will be a key enabler for 5G to deliver on its bandwidth and latency requirements  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[https://www.thefastmode.com/expert-opinion/16410-5g-needs-edge-computing-to-deliver-on-its-promises](https://www.thefastmode.com/expert-opinion/16410-5g-needs-edge-computing-to-deliver-on-its-promises)\n\nWhat if the weird shape of the Xbox Series X is due to built-in 5G antennas?\n\nTo back this speculation up, Microsoft says it\u2019s planning \u2018bold\u2019 moves to make you pick the Xbox Series X over Sony\u2019s PS5: [https://bgr.com/2020/02/11/xbox-series-x-vs-ps5-microsoft-has-bold-launch-plans-for-new-xbox/](https://bgr.com/2020/02/11/xbox-series-x-vs-ps5-microsoft-has-bold-launch-plans-for-new-xbox/)\n\nPart of this bold move will assuredly be coupling the Xbox Series X with the xCloud, which is Microsofts cloud-based gaming service and it runs off of Microsoft\u2019s Azure data centers. [https://www.geekwire.com/2019/testing-microsofts-project-xcloud-new-streaming-service-feels-like-magic-trick/](https://www.geekwire.com/2019/testing-microsofts-project-xcloud-new-streaming-service-feels-like-magic-trick/)\n\nThe Xbox will probably exist as the GPU edgenode for gaming but also a 5G node because the bigger picture above gaming applciations is delivering the software and infrastructure for 5G data distribution. This is Azures purpose.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Microsoft, Nokia, and 5G**\n\nRemember the US nodding to Nokia and Ericsson for competing with Huawei for 5G [https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-02-12/forget-buying-nokia-the-u-s-has-a-60-billion-huawei-solution](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-02-12/forget-buying-nokia-the-u-s-has-a-60-billion-huawei-solution)\n\nWell guess who's already partnered up with nokia and a little-known cullular provider for working on 5G?\n\n&gt;Microsoft is working with AT&amp;T for future cloud and 5G applications  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[https://news.microsoft.com/2019/11/26/att-integrating-5g-with-microsoft-cloud-to-enable-next-generation-solutions-on-the-edge/](https://news.microsoft.com/2019/11/26/att-integrating-5g-with-microsoft-cloud-to-enable-next-generation-solutions-on-the-edge/)\n\nMicrsoft also partnering with Nokia for cloud and 5G.

Remember the JEDI contract?\n\n&gt;\"We are the only guys today who have the ability to distribute computation, dispute data and then have consistency of management, security and data across those two plates,\u201d Nadella added.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[https://mspoweruser.com/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-explains-why-microsoft-won-the-10-billion-jedi-cloud-contract/](https://mspoweruser.com/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-explains-why-microsoft-won-the-10-billion-jedi-cloud-contract/)\n\nWell what if JEDI is only the tip of the iceberg? Who cares about one $10B contract with the Department of Defense when 5G-serving wireless carriers are paying you for organizing 5G data distribution?\n\n&gt;Microsoft, Dell, and others are not developing 5G infrastructure hardware. Instead, they are developing a common engineering standard that would allow 5G software developers to run code atop machines that come from nearly any 5G hardware manufacturer. They are developing software and cloud capabilities that will replace a lot of the 5G equipment which is supplied by Huawei.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[https://mspoweruser.com/u-s-government-working-with-microsoft-and-others-for-developing-5g-alternative-to-huawei/](https://mspoweruser.com/u-s-government-working-with-microsoft-and-others-for-developing-5g-alternative-to-huawei/)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[https://www.techradar.com/news/us-wants-microsoft-dell-and-others-to-develop-huawei-5g-alternative](https://www.techradar.com/news/us-wants-microsoft-dell-and-others-to-develop-huawei-5g-alternative)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nBTFD\n\nTake a look at what happened to Microsoft's share price after 10/26/2019. That was the JEDI contract boom. The share price trend following that date isn't going away any time soon. Every quarter they beat forecasted EPS.
