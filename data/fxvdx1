{"id": "fxvdx1", "title": "SQ Predictions from a gaped asshole", "selftext": "SQ Has treated me well in the past as a Bear, rode that shit down from $56 to $43 - netting me about 25k. I saw the first leg up (4/7) as a dead cat bounce considering SQ is largely dependent on subscriptions and transactions, and I felt it was going to drop below $38 in the coming weeks with the floating rumor of a May extension on social distancing. I also felt like I hit the jack pot considering Dorsey was pseudo diluting his shares thus devaluing the stock in the future, allowing for a quicker onset for the downward trend. Fuck I was wrong, didn't expect SQ to Jump up to 60$ over the course of this week, losing me 80% of my portfolio (I'm fucking retarded, I know).\n\nNew game plan? SQ is an extremely volatile stock, priced very well, and has a lot of upward momentum since investors see a ton of future potential. I think we'll see another dip a couple weeks before their 5/06 1st Quarter report, but will trend upwards again after its released.  Regardless, there's a lot of money to be made on uptrend. In the event some shit was to go down, then I see this box shaped bitch heading below $30, hopefully to $20 into the ground where it fucking belongs.\n\nI naturally have a bearish outlook on the market because of all the shit thats surrounding us but I'm not going to fight JPowells printer, or anyone else. Now I see the market as a last-call-girl, you know the 4 thats been eyeing you all night? Deep down I know I shouldn't be doing it, but fuck it - getting jr. wet is better than Rosey Palm waiting for me at home.\n\nPositions: Currently cash gang until my funds clear Monday, sold all my positions today. Will be buying Calls OTM and hedge with puts, both with month expiry. Once  we hit the 70's then I'll reevaluate in consideration of the market condition.\n\nUpcoming Positions: SQ $61.50C 4/27, $66C 5/08, $60p 6/19\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i6vy19f2btr41.png?width=2078&format=png&auto=webp&s=8121869f33456cabf016ebd273b5def80fbf02cc", "created_utc": 1586449282.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxvdx1/sq_predictions_from_a_gaped_asshole/", "is_self": true}
