{"id": "ev8adj", "title": "You bulls are retarded, this is nothing like a normal flu, this is apocalyptic", "selftext": "The seasonal Flu has a r0 of 1.3 and infects about 10-50 million a year with a mortality rate of 0.1% so 10-50,000 deaths a year.\n\nThe corona virus has a r0 of 3-5 and has a mortality rate of 3-4% (maybe even higher). That means if it runs its course like a flu, it would in the U.S. alone infect 100-250 million within a year and kill 3-10 million people. This is 300x-500x more dangerous than a normal flu. It would also kill about 50-150 million globally due to poorer health care services in developing countries.\n\nEven if R0 goes down to 2 due to successful draconian quarantine (fat chance of that happening in the US). you are talking about still likely 20-150 million infected with 600k - 6 million dead. This is basically stopping all interstate travel and shutting down all airports. What is the GDP implication of that?\n\nCities are far more densely populated than during the spanish flu outbreak of 1918, which killed about 600k in the US when population was under 100 million and that was a r0 of 1.4-2.3 and that had a case/fatality of 3-6%. This is far far worse due to increasing globalization and higher urban density.\n\ndoes this look like  just a SARs to you?
