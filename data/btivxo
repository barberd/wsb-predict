You are one cool-ass motherfucker.  Not sure if I got this right but fuck it, fire away.\n\n\u2014-\n\nOn a cold and gray February in 1992, about a dozen men quietly moved into a non-descript office park in Norfolk, VA and begin unpacking and carefully sorting reams of laser-printed paper slips they had shipped in from Melbourne, Australia a few days earlier.\u00a0 And when that was done, they withdrew $7m from the local Crestar bank branch (which was also transferred from Melbourne) and used the funds to buy stacks of cashier\u2019s checks in small amounts.\n\nThis was February of 1992, and the Virginia Lottery was a big thing back then. And as the Lottery pot grew past $20m (which was a lot at the time), the locals were getting excited.\u00a0 The men in the office were also watching the lottery grow, but they were cool.\u00a0 They had a plan.\u00a0 And \u202aon February 13th\u202c, with the pot at $27m, they divided up the paper slips and money orders and assigned each man a carefully mapped route to dozens (or hundreds) of local gas stations and convenience stores.\u00a0 There they planned to spend $7m buying $1 Virginia lottery tickets. \u00a0\n\nAnd within a day or so, they had bought millions of tickets.\u00a0 So much so, that they started to clog the system.\u00a0 By \u202a3pm on the 14th\u202c, the Chesapeake branch of the Farm Fresh Grocery Store had to put an \u201cout of order\u201d sign on their lottery terminal to handle the men\u2019s orders.\u00a0 That branch alone sold a staggering $3m in tickets that day. \u00a0 At a Miller Convenience Store branch in Norfolk, clerks had to steer customers to other locations while they printed over $600k in tickets for the quiet customer with the trunk full of money orders and lottery slips.\u00a0 And this was a problem for the men.\u00a0 It turns out, convenience store clerks are not properly trained to clear millions of dollars in lottery trades.\u00a0 That is the domain of Wall Street.\u00a0 And by the 11:15pm lottery deadline \u202aon February 15th\u202c, the men had purchased only $5m of the $7m tickets they had planned to buy.\u00a0 Oh shit, they thought, this is not good.\n\nSo what the fuck was going on? \u00a0\n\nThe men were agents of a small Australian firm called International Lotto Fund (ILF) and ILF was manage by a Romanian-born economist and 13 time lottery winner named Stephan Mendal.\u00a0 Yeah, you read that right.\u00a0 The dude won the lottery 13 times.\u00a0 How the fuck does that happen?\u00a0 Well, it\u2019s really not as hard as it sounds, and I\u2019ll get to that, but first a little bit on Mendal.\n\nMendal was born in Communist Romania and worked as an economist for some State-owned industrial polluter of rivers making $88/month.\u00a0 Now, although Romania was cheap back in the day, $88/mo was not enough to feed his family and so he begins thinking of ways to make money and improve his situation.\u00a0 And being mathematically inclined, he quickly realizes that he could beat the Romanian lottery without a ton of money.\u00a0 In a nutshell, if the lottery payout is greater than the cost to purchase every combination of numbers required to guarantee a win, you are assured a profit if you can buy enough tickets.\u00a0 And you don\u2019t need to win the grand prize.\u00a0 If you work the numbers right, you can buy less than the total number of lottery combinations and still make a profit on the smaller payouts.\n\nSo long story short, he does just that and wins enough to bribe his way out of Romania and move his family to Israel and ultimately Australia, winning lotteries all along the way.\u00a0 And this begins a decade long cat and mouse game with lottery officials that looks something like this: Mendal works the system and wins the lottery, the regulators change the rules, Mendal changes strategy, and then Mendal wins the lottery again.\u00a0 If you work on Wall Street, this is something you understand.\n\nBut by 1990, the Australians (and the British, whose lottery he could also play as an Australian resident) are onto his shit and so he goes global and begins looking for bigger targets.\u00a0 And Virginia was perfect.\u00a0 At the time the Virginia lottery was one of the largest in the US and it was easy prey.\u00a0 Virginia had a 6-number lottery, where players picked 6-numbers between 1 and 44.\u00a0 That means 7m possible combinations.\u00a0 So all Mendal needed to do was raise investor money to buy $7m in tickets at a time when the payout was greater than his capital and he could make some real cash money.\u00a0 And by then, his shit was organized.\u00a0 In all those years of lottery hustling he had formed ILF and he knew the ropes.\u00a0 And that brings us back to the men in Norfolk.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t catch it, the men needed to buy $7m in tickets to secure every possible number combination in the Virginia lottery.\u00a0 But they clogged the system and could only buy $5m.\u00a0 Fuck.\u00a0 This was Mendal\u2019s biggest play yet and if it failed, he was fucked.\u00a0 And since he hadn\u2019t locked up every number combination, this was no longer a sure thing.\u00a0 It was gonna be a yolo.\n\nAt 11:25pm on February 15th, 1992, people across Virginia turn on their TVs to watch the lottery drawing.\u00a0 And some official looking motherfucker next to a skirt reaches into a rotating cage of bouncing balls and draws the following: 8, 11, 13, 15, 19 and 20.\u00a0 Which was one of the 3m combinations of numbers sold to one man with a stack of paper slips and cashier\u2019s checks at the Farm Fresh Grocery Store in Chesapeake the day before. Ka-ching.\n\nOk, so that\u2019s cool, right?\u00a0 Well, the Virginia Lottery officials and the IRS and the FBI and the CIA did not think so, and all four agencies initiated investigations into the winning.\u00a0 But fuck, it was all legal, like it or not.\u00a0 So begrudgingly, Virginia releases the funds, after taking 30% in Federal taxes and another 4% in Virginia State taxes.\u00a0\n\nBut there is a final chapter to this here story.\u00a0 Mendal was an Australian resident and Australia and the US really like one another.\u00a0 And when the US really likes another country, we form these tax bromances so that a US citizen working in Australia does not have to pay Australian taxes on their local earnings and vice versa.\u00a0 So on March 24th, 1992, Mendal fills out IRS form 1001 and requests to be paid 100% of the $27m.\u00a0 But the IRS and the State of Virginia do not like this one bit and they challenge the claim in court.\u00a0 And they lose.\u00a0 Which gets them really pissed, so they appeal to the US Court of Appeals. And in March, 1994, in the case of \u201cThe International Lotto Fund v. United States of America\u201d (what a gangster name for a case \u2013 one day I hope to be the plaintiff in \u201cu/cantedlight v. The United States of America\u201d), the judge decides in favor of Mendal, ordering Virginia to pay the motherfuckers \u201cthe full amount of each annual installment, when due, without federal or state income tax withholding throughout the life of the Order\u201d. \u00a0\n\nBuffet once called the lottery a tax on stupidity.\u00a0 And I can\u2019t argue with that.  But this is all still very confusing to me.  If a lottery can be beat tax-free by a Romanian mathematician, while a smart-ass global company like Amazon can pay zero Federal income taxes, I don\u2019t feel very smart writing checks every April 1st.  Maybe Buffet got his words mixed up.  Maybe what he meant to say was that taxes are a lottery on stupidity.  Who knows.  But that\u2019s not the point.  When some dude goes from rags to riches by figuring out a way to win the lottery 14 times and retires on an Island in the South Pacific with his winnings, that\u2019s one fuck of a next-level money hustle and a pretty cool story.\n\nHappy Memorial Day or happy Monday, wherever you might be.
