{"id": "c8roz8", "title": "Zillow - DD", "selftext": "Q1 2019: 454.1 Million\nQ4 2018: 365.9 Million\n19 percent revenue growth\n \nNot a house flipping initiative, providing a service allowing sellers to get their house sold quicker for a fee and then marketing those houses back out to a massive audience. Win/Win for seller, allows them to get paid quicker and not have to worry about updates/selling process/typical real estate commissions.\n \nZillow website/app is the 18th most visited website in the United States, most of those coming from mobile (easily accessible).\n18th sounds good? that beats Netflix #19, Pinterest #23, Linkedin #25.\n \n-Zillow is able to constantly advertise their houses first and send emails to users/notifications, as well as the constant traffic they receive.\n \n-Zillow has mass amounts of data that will help them improve their system as time goes on. This will make their estimates better and can help them market houses out more efficiently. Think Netflix and how they leverage data to pick the perfect show for you!\n195 Million monthly visitors\n \nTraditional Real Estate market is a massive opportunity and Zillow does not need the whole pie...only a piece of it.\n \nYounger generations will browse apps for homes, Zillow being the largest allows them to be ahead of the game.\n \nZillow offers currently:\nPhoenix, Arizona\nLas Vegas, Nevada\nAtlanta, Georgia\nDenver, Colorado\nCharlotte, North Carolina\nRaleigh, North Carolina\nHouston, Texas\nRiverside, California\nDallas-Fort Worth, Texas\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\n \nZillow offers by q1 2020\nOrlando, Florida\nPortland, Oregon\nNashville, Tennessee\nMiami, Florida\nSan Diego, California\nSan Antonio, Texas\nAustin, Texas\nSacramento, California\nTampa, Florida\nLos Angeles, California\n \n \nAccelerated revenue opportunity. Not to mention that they still make a good portion of revenue from their underlying advertisement business. Sellers can use Zillow offers to get a ballpark value for their house, even if they do not sell with Zillow...Zillow can update data and fine tune.\n \nObviously capital intensive and has its fair share of risk\u2026but upside in my opinion is significant. Big data is important and they have mass amounts of data coming in. Look at the reports they are able to release on housing data\u2026more detailed then what the government can even put together. The key point I like to push, is this does not need to kill of traditional real estate\u2026I do not think it will\u2026but it can definitely take a piece of the pie and more as time goes on.\nI know there is other companies that do this, but none have the traffic/user data that Zillow will be able to leverage as time goes on.\n \nIt has had a nice run recently, so it may not be the ideal time to hop in..but that being said as of 6/14 it had 26million shares short, with only 2.8 million daily volume. There is definitely room for a large short squeeze if we see the positive momentum continue.\nI was lucky enough to get in around 35, but I am holding strong.\n \nDisclaimer: \nI can\u2019t offer financial products, just food for thought!", "created_utc": 1562178572, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c8roz8/zillow_dd/", "is_self": true}
