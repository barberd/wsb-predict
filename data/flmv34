{"id": "flmv34", "title": "Bailout Proof Companies to Short", "selftext": "Since governments have thrown in the kitchen sink what stocks or industries do you think are immune from bailouts?  Eg. They will NOT be getting any taxpayer tendies b/c they are not connected enough in government/banking, they are a non-essential industry, they had pre-existing health problems before the  corona hit, etc.   Even if there is a bailout there is a very high chance that shareholders will be wiped out as the public mood is not in it this time around.  The laundry list of industries running to washington dc is too long and there simply is not enough money around to give to everyone.\n\nSo I will go 1st:\n\nHOG - Iconic Boomer company selling overpriced motorcycles.  Their ridership is aging and will be staying indoors for the foreseeable future for fear of exposure.  Also, mgmt  cannot attract younger customers.  Millenials and Gen Z have seen enough gory videos of biker accidents to steer away from riding.  They also rely on selling expensive t shirts and other merchandise.  I would classify HOG as a lifestyle brand and as such a non-essential part of the economy when people are looking to scrape enough money to buy rice and beans.  Their Q4 earnings report this January was bad:  The company reported net income of $13.5 million, or 9 cents a share, up from $495,000, or break-even on a per-share basis, in the year-ago quarter. After adjusting for restructuring-plan costs and the impact of recent tariffs, Harley saw earnings per share rise to 20 cents from 17 cents a year earlier.  Obviously you cannot rely on any prior guidance they gave now.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/harley-davidson-stock-sinks-7-after-earnings-revenue-fall-short-2020-01-28](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/harley-davidson-stock-sinks-7-after-earnings-revenue-fall-short-2020-01-28)\n\nPlease add your own suggestions.\n\nEDIT: Added chart\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dflvcx65nqn41.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=2fac4cdbe140d9e0293297336661425005cd7e4f", "created_utc": 1584670656.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flmv34/bailout_proof_companies_to_short/", "is_self": true}
