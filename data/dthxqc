{"id": "dthxqc", "title": "[Next Level Autists Only] Recursive Leverage, Part 2: The Digital Boogaloo!", "selftext": "Okay, so it appears that RH has closed the infinite money cheat code leaving WSBers looking for the next big thing. I think I may have just the thing, but it\u2019s going to take a special breed to pull this one-off. Why? It involves digital assets (cryptocurrencies) and leverage. How much leverage? Well, that\u2019s up to your personal risk tolerance, but as usual a penny saved is worth two in the bush, so more is better (I think?).\n\nIn order to understand the leverage possibilities, I\u2019ll give a quick lesson on the necessary information so try to keep up.\n\n**CRYPTOCURRENCIES**\n\nIt\u2019s like when you look at your bank account online or at an ATM, it\u2019s just a number, literally money people made up. \\[Remember, it\u2019s not currency until you exchange it for cash\\]. Until then it\u2019s cryptocurrency. We need to get our hands on some of that sweet, sweet crypto.\n\nLike normal cash, cryptocurrencies come in a variety of types and some are worth more than others, but at the end of the day it\u2019s just some made up some. Which one do we need for our plan? Ethereum.\n\n**ETHEREUM**\n\nEthereum is pretty neat. It was made by some Canadian-Russian super genius, Vitalik Buterin. Basically he was apart of the Bitcoin community, then had some great ideas and the bitcoin people were like \u201cCool, brah\u201d... and Vitalik was like \u201cI\u2019m not your brah, dude\u201d so he left and told some rich people about his idea and they gave him money to make it. In exchange for the money, he gave them some Ethereum (ETH) which is digital money he made up. You can get your hands on ETH at a bunch of places online, there are so many tutorials existing.\n\nAnyways, this ETH stuff makes cool nerd things happen online and one of those things that came from it is a project called MakerDAO. This project is important as it provides the backbone for our leverage. I better explain the project.\n\n**MAKERDAO** \n\nMakerDAO is a smart contract running on the Ethereum network. Basically think of MakerDAO like a central bank that issues currency, but on a gold standard type basis\u2026 meaning they only mint currency when it\u2019s backed by something else, like money was in the US long ago. Only thing is MakerDAO doesn\u2019t use gold as the backing for its currency (since you can\u2019t shove gold into the digital world...yet), it uses ETH.\n\nStill with me? Here\u2019s a recap. You buy some ETH with USD/CAD (whatever flavour you use) from one of many online sellers. You then take that ETH and basically send it to the digital MakerDAO vault. Once the ETH is locked in the vault, you can create a new currency called DAI, which is something MakerDAO came out with that is supposed to be equal to $1 USD. So basically you look your money in the vault, talk to the online bookie and take back out DAI. How much DAI? Well, you can be collateralized to 150%, but below that you get automatically penalized (I\u2019m not explaining this system to you basic level autists). So basically, if you locked 1 ETH into the vault and if ETH was worth $100 USD you could pull out $66USD worth of DAI.\n\nWhat to do with the DAI though? Well, it\u2019s accepted at many crypto exchanges at/close to the pegged $1 USD value so you could go exchange it for more ETH and do it all over again.\n\n**WHAT NOW?**\n\nWell, hopefully, you bought your ETH when the price was down (sideways market right now?) and locked it into the contract, pulled out some DAI, and did that again, and again until it just didn\u2019t seem worth it. Well congratulations, you basically opened a long position on ETH. The great thing is that you still own the ETH you\u2019ve locked in the vault, so if it goes up in value to say $150, technically you can now borrow $99 DAI ($33 more as you already took out $66) so why not go buy more ETH and do it all over again?\n\nI hope people have an idea of where I\u2019m thinking on this. Now keep this in mind.\n\n**DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THIS AND RH FREE MONEY CHEAT**\n\nThere are some differences here between the money cheats.\n\n1. You need to lock actual collateral in to start this whole thing. You can get lots of leverage, but need to start with something.\n2. You\u2019re attempting to bet long on a market that sees some pretty large swings, so you may not want to have as crazy a risk tolerance as a normal market.\n3. This requires some level of digital competence; based on many of your posts, most don\u2019t apply and you should have stopped reading long ago.\n4. There is an interest rate for borrowing DAI on your ETH. It\u2019s voted on and changed by a bunch of nerds that control the MakerDAO system. (Disclosure: I hold tokens that can vote, although have never done so because democracy).\n\nIf I\u2019ve got your attention still and you think, can this actually work? Well, I did a little experiment using our Lord and Saviour, Google Sheets. It\u2019s something I worked on a while ago and honestly forgot about as the market was in a position for something like this to be deployed for various reasons (bear market, DAI issuance ceiling, DAI liquidity), but progress has been made! Also MakerDAO is switching from one vault to another, which will have slightly different rules so this spreadsheet will be old idea more than current simulator.\n\nI call the whole recursive loop on the MakerDAO system a Multi-Collaterized Debt Position (MCDP) or Multi-Level Collaterized Debt Position, but that's just my spin.\n\nSimulator: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gKjKRLuoJ6rIguK8EHp4K4QmteU55Y0Yq1kkICDZw5I/copy", "created_utc": 1573231031, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dthxqc/next_level_autists_only_recursive_leverage_part_2/", "is_self": true}
