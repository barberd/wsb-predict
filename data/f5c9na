{"id": "f5c9na", "title": "Why don't more people just risk MORE capital and buy long term call options with the closest strike price from the current price?", "selftext": "For example, why not just buy a long-term call option (an actual good legitimate proven company that\u2019s clearly poised for more growth such as MSFT or VISA) that expires January 2021 with the closest strike price from the current share price? Yes, the option price is going to be expensive but assuming you have somewhat of a significant capital to play with (let\u2019s say at least 30 grand or beyond), wouldn\u2019t it be relatively easy to rack in $1000+ profits once your strike price hits or it goes above? Why don\u2019t more people do this as there\u2019s very very minimal risk to it? \n\nFor example, let\u2019s say I buy a MSFT call option that expires January 15th 2021 with the price per option being roughly $13.43 and I buy 22 contracts (x 100), which would equate to about $29,5400. I can bet my fingers, toes, and testicles that MSFT will reach $195 SOMETIME before January 15th 2021 (They say only death and taxes are guaranteed, but come on, let\u2019s be real, this is a guarantee). Fine, worst case scenario, let\u2019s say it takes another 1-2 months for MSFT to reach $195 \u2013 still, if I wait 1-2 months and it\u2019s at $198, I\u2019ll still make over $9K, which I\u2019ll be very happy with. Is this not a viable strategy if you have the capital? Why don\u2019t more people just risk more capital on long term call options with the closest strike price from the current price? Am I missing something here? If I understand correctly, you can hold your position for as long as you can before the expiration date and sell whenever you want once MSFT reaches $195+.", "created_utc": 1581960867, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f5c9na/why_dont_more_people_just_risk_more_capital_and/", "is_self": true}
