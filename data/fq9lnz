Remember how slow the Fed normally acts it\u2019s policies. \n\nThis time they\u2019re scared... Market crashes are annoying yes, but they\u2019re part of the economic cycle. The Fed is shitting their pants about this market crash. But why? \n\nTrump and Fed keep reiterating this is NOT A financial crisis but a medical crisis. I call bull shit. The Fed has had to run repo operations to maintain liquidity in the repo markets these last couple years with intense programs recently. Something is not right in the financial system\n\nThink of a house plumbing system, water flows smoothly\u2014 \u201cA\u201d OK\u2014water gets blocked somewhere\u2014KABOOM \n\nMoney flow is being blocked somewhere in the financial system\n\nJPM was the likely cause this time just a few months ago when repo rates jumped 10%\n\nJPM declared it was because of reserve ratio laws enacted since 2008 and tax payments withholding that they had to stop loaning money in the repo market where the Fed had to step in and unplug the block \n\nRemember the Fed has now lowered reserve ratios to 0. Interest rates 0. They\u2019re now buying fucking ETF\u2019s \n\nThis shows the Fed is extremely worried about something in the market \n\nThere is a pile of dog shit somewhere in the financial system, similar to CDO\u2019s of 2008\n\nMight be the corporate bonds that banks don\u2019t want as collateral in the repo market causing a freeze, in which case the Fed steps into buy them. But I think corporate bonds are just a spark to the real gasoline lying in the financial markets\u2014ETF\u2019s \n\nWSB God Michael Burry compared ETF\u2019s to CDO\u2019s \n\n[Michael Burry compares ETF\u2019s to CDO\u2019s](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2019-09-04/michael-burry-explains-why-index-funds-are-like-subprime-cdos)\n\n\n[Research paper\u2014ETF\u2019s account for 10% of Market but 20% of short interest](https://jacobslevycenter.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ETF-Short-Interest-and-Failures-to-Deliver.pdf)\n\nAnd a very controversial article by Andrew Bogan pHD. \n\n[Can ETF\u2019s collapse](http://boganassociates.com/whitepapers.html)\n\nThis shit is over my autistic head but some loophole of ETF shorting involved with stock creation and redemption can cause them to collapse quickly under intense selling pressure. Which means they can\u2019t handle an aggressive bear market. \n\nSo...\n\nWhy is the Fed all of the sudden stepping in to buy corporate bond ETF\u2019s and throwing the kitchen sink at the problem? They are literally shaking in their boots. JPow, Fed Chair, doing an interview on the Today show FFS to reassure the American people \n\nI think it\u2019s because ETF\u2019s have produced the capability for a MASSIVE stock market crash, likes of which we\u2019ve never seen \n\nAll it takes is a spark: Let\u2019s call it Beer flu \n\nBeer flu hits\u2014economy halts, corporate bonds become a hot potato, nobody wants to hold. Repo market freezes at points where corporate bonds are collateral. Liquidity crisis ensues. \n\nFed needs to fix this and contain this quickly \n\nOr else this hits the broader market and causes ETF\u2019s to collapse \n\nNow why would the Fed care so much about ETF\u2019s? They\u2019re just another ol\u2019 financial product out of thousands on the market, and all they do is track the real market \n\nI think it has something to do with the ETF custodians\n\nIf they fail, for example if SPY fails, their custodian, in this case State Street Corp and a bank considered \u201ctoo big to fail,\u201d could fall. BlackRock, Vanguard, are custodians to iShares and Vanguard index\u2019s. \n\n*My wild card gamble:*\n\nCall me crazy... BUT \n\nState Street Bank had its stress test, the Fed passed them, but told them they\u2019d be at risk of bankruptcy if under market stress their largest trading partner or counterparty defaulted\u2014Fed doesn\u2019t say who this is, and they know sensitive information about all these players \n\nCurrent market conditions under beer flu are WORSE then the Feds stress test\u2014meaning State Streets counterparty could be in big trouble of defaulting as Fed has pointed out \n\nScenario: \n\nCoronavirus causes corporate bonds to go to shit, repo market freezes, liquidity dries up, volatility takes off\n\nIntense shorting of SPY ETF could cause a counterparty Authorized Participant (AP) of State Street to collapse\u2014this could be a market maker or other financial institution that\u2019s working with State Street in the creation and redemption process which maintains SPY.\n\nState Street is considered too big to fail. Meaning if they fall, it would cause global shock to the financial systems \n\nMy hunch says, SPY ETF is at risk and so is State Street if market volatility picks up beyond a certain threshold which causes the ETF to collapse \n\nThe Fed is buying individual corporate bonds and corporate bond ETF\u2019s as a way to prop the markets collectively but doing so in a way that doesn\u2019t point to the true problem they have\u2014ETF collapses in a bear market\u2014causing \u201cToo big to fail\u201d banks to collapse\n\nTl;dr: The very nature of ETF creation and redemption mechanism makes it susceptible to easily collapse under extreme selling. Michael Burry compares ETF\u2019s to CDO\u2019s of 2008. SPY ETF and it\u2019s custodian State Street could be at risk. Probably why the Fed is acting wildly to protect ETF liquidity. \n\nNo formal positions yet \n\n12/08 SPY $100 P\n\nSTT long dated puts \n\nVCSH and LQD calls when market price under Net Asset Value and money printer goes BRRRR", "created_utc": 1585355453.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fq9lnz/federal_reserve_secondary_market_corporate_credit/", "is_self": true}
