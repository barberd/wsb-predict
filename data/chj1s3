{"id": "chj1s3", "title": "Why BYND will continue to rise and rise for the next 2/3 years. Then brutally crash, Theranos style, as it is revealed that their product is seed oil/Soy/estrogen laden garbage that causes cancer and diabetes", "selftext": "There are many factors that virtually guarantee the short term success of Beyond Meat. \n\n- The fashionableness of veganism\n- The pseudo-science that says normal meat is \"unhealthy\" and \"bad for the planet\".\n- The EXTREME amount of power wielded by progressives and vegan-types, and their widespread presence in virtually every institution, especially academia, the media, and advertising departments of corporations.\n-It is mass processed, seed oil and Soy laden, estrogenic garbage that turns boys and men into low-t faggots, which is what the elites want\n\nWhilst there will be ups and downs like in any publicly available and traded market, the overall trend for BYND will be massive growth for the next 2/3 years. The above facts of the matter put BYND in a very different situation to most other companies. \n\nTheir product has **massive social relevance**. It isn't dry, like gold, shale, intel microchips, or other such bullshit no-one cares about. No, your little vegan SJW niece with the pink hair will take it upon herself to evangelize for BYND. And the soyboy faggots that write for the New York times will also do this, seeing an opportunity to be progressive, they'll give away $millions of free advertising to promote what they consider a progressive good. So will all cucked governments in the EU, convinced that reducing our consumption of meat will be key to combating climate change, while simultaneously using pseudo-science to tell us that meat is bad for you (saturated fat myth, Cholesterol causes heart disease myth). You'll see front page propaganda pieces all over the internet talking about how delicious Beyond Meat is, how it is the future.\n\nThe power structure of our time, the elites, WANT BYND to succeed, and so it will succeed. McDonalds, Burger King, Subway, they will all incorporate it into products. Within 2 years it will be made available everywhere. Literally everywhere. It will become mainstream, and a household product. Every school/corporation/institution that has a significant number of vegan or progressives inside it will start offering BYND products at their lunch facilities. The most advanced and sophisticated machine of propaganda that has ever existed, the academic-media-government complex, wants BYND to moon.\n\nIt is the safest possible buy out of everything in the market right now. And can reasonably be expected to 4/5x by July 2021. There is no other company that the power-structure of our world wants to succeed more than BYND. \n\nHowever, the extreme negative health effects of this product will eventually become public knowledge. They have differing products, some contain brutally high levels of Soy (which makes men estrogenic, Low-T f@ggots, this is proven), and their main products which have removed the soy **(they even advertise them as NO SOY on the front of the box, because they know how bad soy is for you and don't want their main flagship product to have such a poisonous ingredient in)** HOWEVER they have replaced the soy with ungodly levels of seed oil, especially canola oil, which is just as poisonous as Soy, and causes diabetes. Not to mention pea protein isolate which has been linked to various mysterious illnesses and deaths. Their products are pure poison. **LITERAL poison.**\n\n Whether or not BYND crashes (or has a series of micro-crashes as negative news stories about people dying from adverse reactions or getting sick become known), will depend on how willing the power academic-media-government complex is to outright lie and cover up the extreme human suffering this product will cause. \n\nIf they cover it up well, perhaps there will never be a crash, and BYND will become too big to fail. If they fail to cover it up, we see BYND moon for the next 2/3 years, then brutally crash as they are forced to recall their products due to how many people are dying. The vegan lunatics involved in BYND will also not admit that their product is dangerous, as they are too ideologically invested in it. And as they won't be able to come up with any solutions, as it is actually impossible to make a \"realistic meat substitute\" that *bleeds fake blood* without creating literal Frankenstein burgers based on hundreds of highly processed oils, gels, and molecular derivatives - they will either completely fail as a company, or engage in massive corruption, lobbying, and cover up. BYND could be the next Theranos. Theranos, who were given endless free promotion by the elites, because their female leader made them a potential propaganda item, and \"proof\" of the elite's progressive ideology. So too could we see this with BYND. A moon rise, given free promotion by the elite, then a brutal crash as their product is revealed to be garbage.\n\nIn fact I am calling that they will hit $1000 by July 2021. Then brutally crash to $50 or less by the end of 2023.", "created_utc": 1564029585, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/chj1s3/why_bynd_will_continue_to_rise_and_rise_for_the/", "is_self": true}
