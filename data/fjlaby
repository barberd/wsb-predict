{"id": "fjlaby", "title": "2000/2008 Trading Veteran Here: This is What Happens Next", "selftext": "I'm not really a trading veteran, tbh. I've always been broke af. My implying that I'm some dusty, old, battle-scarred market veteran climbing out of a foxhole to teach you green shoots how to avoid fragmentation grenades was carefully considered clickbait designed to get you to read this so that I could earn Internet points because those of us from Generation X invented Internet 1.0, which had no Internet currency, and we lack the Millennial wit. Thus, we're resentful of the self-esteem your Internet currency earns you and yet we're also not good at earning it ourselves, so we steal it like adolescent Spartan boys had to steal bread. \n\nI remember in 2000 hearing about my fellow college kids throwing their entire life and college savings into farts.com, which of course had not one penny of revenue from which to even dream of earnings. That one didn't turn out so well. Frankly, it's probably fortuitous for me that I was then, as I am now, broke af because I was probably stupid enough then as I am now to think that the Internet of Things was the New Paradigm ten years before it would actually literally become the New Paradigm. \n\nIn 2008 I was riveted to my CRT monitor, watching Citibank's stock crater while the CEO insisted they had all the money they needed. I watched as it hit the recession lows of about $0.97 on delayed quotes because you had to pay for fucking everything back then. \n\nAnd stocks. You had to pay for those. I mean of course commissions. And that brings me to my main point: what is this market crash like? My God, *it's so fast*. But, setting that aside, the emotions are all the same. The rising fear in the news, the growing alarm as pundits literally do begin to fear that it might actually go to fucking zero itself. But keep in mind: times are different now. Just like humans are prone to scorn the very thought of paying $0.99 for an app on their $1000 iPhone, humans are also stupid in this way: as their $100,000 retirement portfolio craters 40%, they will actually hesitate to sell because they don't want to pay the $17.99 commission. The speed of this market crash may be looked at in history as having been caused by free commissions and smartphones, the resentful dot.com bubble glaring out of the grave of history with a smile.\n\nIn 2008, browsers didn't even remember one's login details, let alone smartphone apps, let alone having no cost to sell. It was *harder* to *act* on panic back then. But beware: it's also now so much easier to act on regret, too.\n\nThere's an old saying: \"You ain't seen nothin' like a bear market rally.\" That aphorism was scratched into Celtic limestone back in the ages when bears had more stamina and before their numbers had been hunted into relative oblivion. Some say they once outnumbered people back then, emerging from the the Black Forest of Germany from time to time with the heads of toddlers clamped between their teeth. But I digress.\n\nProbably when we test the December 2018 lows and a good bounce happens (and it will) all those panicking people who sold their portfolios at fire sale prices will feel a regret only matched by the fear they felt when they sold. \n\n*And you ain't seen nothin' like a bear market rally.*", "created_utc": 1584366782.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjlaby/20002008_trading_veteran_here_this_is_what/", "is_self": true}
