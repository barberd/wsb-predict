If you're challenged on one side (ie: it goes tits up one way), you roll the unchallenged side towards the tested side up until you're in an iron butterfly. If by 14-21 DTE stock price still isn't within range, you roll out. Typical, right?\n\nHere's something i've noticed, particularly with crude oil.\n\nSo about 2w ago, i sold a $1 wide ($1,000 real) iron condor with short strikes at the 58p and 53c. This was before the brief Iran-US tension. I collected about $520 (an AMAZING 52% of spread) because the short strikes were around 25-30 deltas each. This was about 56 DTE.\n\nDuring the Iran tensions, CL moved above $64, above the long strike, so i rolled the 57/58 put spread up to the 62/63 put spread making an iron butterfly. with a $1-wide spread ($1,000 remember), I have a total CR of $905; my risk on this play is $95, or $0.09 on CL options.\n\nNow w/ $905 in collected premium my breakevens are \\~$62.10 and $63.90. I still have 28 DTE.\n\nHere's the interesting part. I'm unequivocally comfortable going naked strangle/straddle in /CL. Now, that long put that's technically ITM by a few bucks is worth $3,870. I have faith that economic indicators will show stable/improving GDP growth which has upward pressure on CL. \n\nI could sell that $62 put for $3,870 to have a total CR of $4,865, my breakeven now being 58.44 to the down side and NO UPSIDE risk as the $1,000 spread to upside would be covered by the $4,865 total CR.\n\nKeep in mind guys... this is one contract. the total buying power/margin for this is \\~$6,000, at least in IBKR.\n\nThoughts? personally, I'd like this option over trying to roll out in time first.\n\nMy point here is: if this strategy can take in large CR's and essentially eliminate risk to one side, why the hell not?!", "created_utc": 1579228415, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/epu0ob/turning_a_risk_management_strategy_into_an/", "is_self": true}
