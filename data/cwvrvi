{"id": "cwvrvi", "title": "LYFT - Post lockup limbo?", "selftext": "I honestly lost interest in following both LYFT and UBER. Made some small successful scalps upon IPO, but have stayed away since. (wish I could say the same for BYND) Regardless, I took another quick look at LYFT tonight:  \n\\&gt; surprisingly good Q2 ER  \n\\&gt; analyst upgrades  \n\\&gt; lockup period has expired early  \n==================================  \n\\&gt;&gt; stock practically at all time low - still\n\nWhat does this mean? The only thing I'm tracking is that the California senate may or may not vote on A.B. 5 - which has the potential to severely impact current revenue outlook and paths to profitability by forcing LYFT &amp; UBER to classify drivers as employees in the state. This is an entirely separate discussion to be had, but \n\n**1. is this what's keeping the price so low, post-lockup?**\n\nI'll be first to say I'm not well versed when it comes to political process when it comes to passage of new bills.\n\n**On Friday, August 30th, bill A.B. 5 will be voted on in suspense. See:**   \n[https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billStatusClient.xhtml?bill\\_id=201920200AB5](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billStatusClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB5)  \n[https://www.senate.ca.gov/sites/senate.ca.gov/files/dailyfile/SEN\\_STD\\_2019\\_R\\_20190828.PDF](https://www.senate.ca.gov/sites/senate.ca.gov/files/dailyfile/SEN_STD_2019_R_20190828.PDF)\n\nI had no idea wtf a suspense file is and what voting in suspense is, but see: [https://cafwd.org/reporting/entry-new/keeping-californians-in-suspense](https://cafwd.org/reporting/entry-new/keeping-californians-in-suspense) for a decent explanation.\n\nSummary: suspense is where bills often go to die so the public can't see which senators voted for or against. Often the bills would impose too high cost on the state or are not high-enough priority. In the case of UBER/LYFT, this is very high profile and there were massive demonstrations and lobbying being down for/against.\n\n*\"The committee will hear a bill on the Suspense File just prior to the fiscal committee deadlines. When a bill is placed on the committee\u2019s agenda as \"From Suspense File \u2013 For Vote Only,\" no testimony will be taken and the authors need not be present.\"*\n\nSo, am I understanding this correctly? Friday, we will know whether or not ride-sharing platforms will be able to continue to operate with drivers hired as independent contractors - as is current?\n\n**2. does anyone see this as a really opportune moment for long calls given an IV% of 33%?**", "created_utc": 1567051504, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cwvrvi/lyft_post_lockup_limbo/", "is_self": true}
