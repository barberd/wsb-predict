If I only did the exact opposite...\n\nThis notion of holding your puts because of \"Diamond Hands\" while getting decimated by the best week in history is a loser move. The price action is staring you in the face, aggressively, so don't be proud of giving your money away like an idiot. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I took my losses, I listened to that Variation guy, I thought I was right and I held on to SPY puts and kept rolling them. I was wrong. \n\nBeing right isn't the game we are playing. We want tendies. \n\nTo get those tendies, don't care about being right, and **be prepared to inverse yourself.** \n\n**You were probably wrong and don't know shit.** \n\nYou likely not a smart person, and not an educated investor, so your initial idea was probably stupid. Just do the opposite. \n\nI thought what is the opposite of SPY puts, and came up with: SPCE 18C \n\nToday I closed those for a gain 600%. \n\nHow many hands (or feet) do you have? If you have two, each can grab different things differently. Let's make our weak hand our paper hand and our strong hand our diamond hand. \n\nTwo hands, two strategies, get it so far? \n\nIn your strong hand, you hold the winners with **Diamonds**: \n\n* Is theta not raping you? is holding overnight not retarded? Is VIX doing the right thing for you? Did sentiment change? Are the chart and current dildos still working in your favor? Were you right? \n* *Don't be a pussy, HODL*\n\nIn your weaker hand, hold losers with **Paper**: \n\n* Is theta raping you? Would you still buy this position now? Is the strike price even possible anymore? Were you wrong? \n* *Dump those bags, and inverse yourself*", "created_utc": 1586934297.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1myjs/dont_be_afraid_to_inverse_yourself_it_takes_two/", "is_self": true}
