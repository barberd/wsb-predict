{"id": "d9npu8", "title": "Super complete DD - Recap of KB Homes ER and guidance report", "selftext": "Here's an outline of ER and guidance and my evaluation of the results:\n\nER:\n\n* EPS Beat by 7 cents. Expected 0.66 p/s vs. Actual 0.73 p/s\n* 1.16B revenue - shy of analyst expected 1.17B\n* Community absorption rate increased 23.7% (Meaning availability of homes for sale increased 23.7% to meet demand)\n* 90% of homes have experienced price increases to increase future revenues, meet demand, and offset debt.\n* $1.8B in debt but a 180M cashflow - Relatively healthy as a result of a $2.3B in backlog (pending orders, etc.)\n* KBH planning to continue expansion of neighborhoods and will use revenue towards debt repayment program. \n* 68M net income - Based on numbers below compared to that of last year 2018 3Q.\n   * Home Deliveries increased 9.17%\n   * Net Home Orders increased 24% Backlogged Orders increased 14$\n      * For greater perspective, home deliveries is important for immediate income that is accounted for in the ER.\n      * Net Home Orders increase indicates growth in business and growth in demand (as suggested otherwise by people that are NOT in this industry and hearing from the general population of the uninformed)\n      * Back log of $2.3B is great for future earnings numbers. \n\nGuidance:\n\n* Expectations are in line and maintained despite less than stellar performance on the net orders. \n* Company is focused on financial reconciliation to reduce outstanding debt; a proportion of the revenue will be used in a debt repayment program.\n* The company expects to be well within positive cash flow by next quarter and are confident that backlogs will start being cleared in the coming quarter and for 2020. \n* Year-over-year gross profit margins and revenues are expected to grow but no expected amount reported; this makes sense with the $2.3B in backlogs that they are prepared to fulfill shortly. \n* Their plans of expansion is also another good sign that the company is positioning for a strong finish to 2019 and 2020. If the company was in financial trouble, as some suggested in the KBH forums, there would not be a focus on expansion nor a solid debt repayment plan or expectation of positive cash flow and definitely not year-over-year revenue growth expectations. \n\nHopefully this helps some. I believe this company is still undervalued compared in the industry and compared to that of its major direct competitors.", "created_utc": 1569522624, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d9npu8/super_complete_dd_recap_of_kb_homes_er_and/", "is_self": true}
