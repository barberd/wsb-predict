{"id": "fh1ney", "title": "Back with SPY predictions", "selftext": "Disclaimer: I\u2019m a degenerate who likes looking at graphs and has a gambling addiction (but made 50% return today)\n\nHi yet again my fellow autists, as you can tell, my guess turned out to be correct and the market opened red today. This reinforces the trend and I will buy either calls or puts on SPY based on it before the closure today again.\n\nWhat happened yesterday: People were anticipating good news from Trump. Just like always he made himself an idiot (not surprising). Hence stonks went down.\n\nThis graph shows a reoccurring trend that basically happens every day for quite some time now. We can see that if the market closes with a 15 min green candle, it will open a lot lower the next day and vice versa.\n\nThis happens because we are in a very volatile market and people are scared to keep their stocks overnight. This means if the market is trending up at the end of the day people will be selling and if market is going down most see it as an opportunity. This results in the market going in the opposite direction on the next day opening.\n\nAdditionally, if we end up breaking the 273 resistance today and close with a green candle (15 min), the chance of it being bloody tomorrow is very fucking high.\n\n[https:\\/\\/imgur.com\\/a\\/fmwjS9x](https://preview.redd.it/qyxzkcfcb3m41.png?width=2620&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf3dbb4108a3ffef3c51b13ae6317d735fee3efd)\n\nId like to address a couple of comments from yesterday:\n\nFor the retard who mentioned recency bias. The whole theory of trading is based on the idea that a trend is more likely to continue than stop. This is different from flipping a coin since the market fluctuations are caused my people's phycology, not mere chance.\n\nChanged the graph to the dark mode.\n\nAdded new arrows which look better and coloured them with my crayons.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR for people with short attention span: If SPY is closing red, but calls. If SPY is closing green buy put.\n\nEDIT: This depends on the volume at the end of the day. This trend might not work if the volume is low last 30 minutes.\n\nEDIT 2: If we are closing with 3 green 15min candles and volume as high or higher as yesterday I'm spending all my miserable 900 on puts.\n\n3rd update for sexually confused: If last candle green, outs. If red, better wait!\n\nLast edit: these are confusing times, safer to wait until tomorrow", "created_utc": 1583950708.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fh1ney/back_with_spy_predictions/", "is_self": true}
