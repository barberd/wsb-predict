Yield of 5%\n\nDecent growth with DCF that would put it around $42-48 based on variables\n\nStock just broke out today above several resistance levels on decent volume\n\nStock is deep value at this point, extremely oversold. Down way more than the peer group on TTM basis. Just look at last quarters top sellers from 13F filings... literally all large institutions dumping to re rate.\n\nThe stock is significantly undervalued relative to peer group on all major valuations basis FY1 P/E, EV/EBITDA, etc.\n\nStock has been mentioned several times on CNBC in last couple weeks. \n\nThere are 100% risks to the sector from an oversupply and pricing perspective, but they just committed to slowing the pipeline and reducing jobs (first in the sector to do so). \n\nStock is destined for a rebound as its trading well below historical valuations. \n\nRight now, I\u2019m levered up in common stock. I will be looking for opportunities to opportunistically buy vertical call spreads for additional upside and selling medium-term calls on my common stock position until it reaches my price target. \n\n\n[Current Position w/o Options Yet](https://imgur.com/gallery/tsiUtpm)", "created_utc": 1568164774, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d2i6ko/wrk/", "is_self": true}
