{"id": "gjeq0o", "title": "Reduced endowments, cratering consumer spending, mass public furloughs, and profit.", "selftext": "Alright retards, I'm going to post this one more time and then be done with it.\n\nI'm a goddamned red blooded American. I believe in our markets, I make money in our markets. I've taken a break from grilling wartime production act porkchops, training paratroopers to fight poor people in foreign deserts, and orally pleasuring my wife thrice fucking daily to let you in a little secret.\n\nHigher education is temporarily *FUUUUUUUCKED.*\n\nThis isn't a bear thing, it's not a bull thing.  This isn't an agenda, and this sure as fuck doesn't give a shit whether you think this virus is a nasty cold or the bubonic fucking plague.  This isn't staring at our assholes imagining our near future as a less cool version of Mr. King's *The Cocksucking Stand.*  This has already happened.  The mistakes have already been made, the die is already cast.\n\nAt the bottom of this post is as list of schools trying to tell you just how fucked they are.  Read it if you want.\n\nNotice something?  These aren't just schools in red states, or blue states, this is schools in almost ALL states, and the pain has only just begun.  It doesn't matter if your *particular* governor has authorized his inbred trucker hat constituents to go eat tactical camo glazed donuts on their way to buy more camouflaged AK47 bayonets at Wally's Spandex and Muffin Top Emporium of the Soon to be Diseased, or if she has doubled down on the lockdown of the her trembling thick-rimmed dreadlocked lesbian artisanal salt enthusiast denizens.  If covid went away in two weeks, it **wouldn't matter.**\n\nUnemployment doesn't mean shit to the markets right now. Unemployment money enthusiastically purchases yolos just as well as doing something for a living money does.  More, maybe.  But it DOES matter to states.  Because they have to pay for it, and right now it is absolutely gutting every other state program.  Nothing else matters.  States MUST pay it, or shit collapses, so everything else is on the chopping block.\n\n[Endowments are damaged](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-northwestern-university-finances-coronavirus-20200511-k4vv5mhkxnctdhtkjkaqqhrrxa-story.html), and in any case must be drawn from in a way that doesn't draw on the principal of the endowment.\n\nResearch grants, a large percentage of any reputable schools funding, are being completely paused while every discipline even tangentially related to the well being of human beings is reassigned to COVID research.\n\nAnd that leaves the elephant in the room. **Enrollment.**\n\nContrary to popular belief, universities DO NOT sell education.  Not anymore, not for a long time.  Universities sell \"lifestyle experiences\". Who gives a fuck about Quadrilateral Phase Induction 214 when you can pay massively inflated rates to drink shit beer with your other degenerate friends and find out, once and for all if you really ARE into the way asshole tastes when it's been marinating in axe body spray and barely post pubecent sweat for the last two days.  And it is MASSIVELY expensive.  This is because smart people decades ago found out that the best way to extract money from little Timmy isn't to have him firing 12 million dollar rockets at brown people until his leg is gnawed off by a Lesser Vagigated Jungle Rape Scorpion, but instead to saddle him with huge, nondefaultable debt while he puts his underwhelming peach fuzzed willy into any willing moving thing.\n\nAnd they can't do ANY of that online.  Estimates indicate that enrollment will drop by a VERY substantial number if classes are moved online. And they will be.\n\nSo how, you ask, can we short the schools and profit off of the misfortune of Middle American Teenagers, as is the FUCKING AMERICAN WAY for monied people and those that aspire to them?  We can't place puts on *colleges!*\n\nRight you are, my young and intrepid friend.  But we can short student support services.\n\nAnd that brings me, finally, to American Campus Communities, Inc. Options are still cheap.  Buy it for the fall time, because by then, this is going to be headline news every fucking day. Or if you're cheap buy it for the summer time.  Doesn't matter, puts will print.\n\nI know you're not used to waiting that fucking long to go eat some free McDonald's, but you're sure as fuck going to be able to eat a lot of it.\n\nPositions at the end of this post, you fucking rockstars.\n\n\n\n\n\n**THE LIST OF PAIN**\n\nAntioch College furloughed 27 staff and cut hours and/or compensation to others.\n\nAtlantic Cape Community College laid off about 100 staff who could not work remotely.\n\nBob Jones University furloughed an unspecified number of staff.\n\nBoston University laid off more than 1600 student workers.\n\nBristol Community College laid off 136 part time workers.\n\nDrew University furloughed some staff.\n\nGuilford College furloughed 166 people, or \u201c[s]lightly more than half of the college\u2019s 250 non-faculty employees.\u201d\n\nHarvard University froze all kinds of raises and projects, while cutting the salaries of its president, VP, and provost.\n\nJohns Hopkins University announced a series of cuts, including this strategy: \u201cdivisional leaders will exercise their discretion and have to consider furloughs or layoffs when necessary to meet their financial and strategic objectives in such a constrained budget environment\u2026\u201d  They may face a $375 million deficit this fall.\n\nKent State University called for a 20% budget cut, which will be carried out by \u201creducing operating budgets by 20%, enacting a hiring freeze, postponing new campus construction projects, \u2026 reducing spending on athletics,\u201d and cutting senior administrator salaries.\n\nKeuka College furloughed an undetermined number of staff while issuing wage cuts.\n\nLake Superior State University will apparently commence layoffs.\n\nLewis-Clark State College ended around 16 staff positions and is working on cuts to faculty.\n\nMarquette University furloughed around 250 staff, notably those who could no longer work remotely.\n\nMerrimack College laid off 30 staff.\n\nOakland University cut salaries of several senior administrators.\n\nOhio University announced it would lay off 140 staff.  \u201cThis (is) our first significant personnel reduction,\u201d [Carly Leatherwood, a university spokesperson] said.\u201d\n\nPortland State University will furlough 106 staff.\n\nRochester Institute of Technology will furlough some staff and \u201cis prepared to introduce a salary reduction program.\u201d\n\nRutgers, State University of New Jersey, cut senior administration compensation and signaled it would hire fewer adjuncts this summer and fall.\n\nSmith College cut or requested voluntary cuts to some senior administrators\u2019 compensation.\n\nSouthern Oregon University furloughed 395 staff.\n\nSyracuse University cut some staff compensation and froze merit pay increases.\n\nUnion College furloughed 30% of its staff.\n\nThe University of Akron announced plans to cut academic programs and student athletics.\n\nThe University of Alaska will furlough 166 administrators.\n\nThe University of Arizona announced furloughs and pay cuts to a range of employees.
