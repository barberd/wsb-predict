Would be great to work with a fellow trader. Don't want to reveal too much in the post but I'll give a rough idea of what it entails and what kind of person I'm looking to work with.\n\nThe project: Create a tool for investors/traders to easily access publicly traded company financial info (example: [Simply Wall St](https://simplywall.st/about) , but this tool we be far more granular and detailed)\n\nLooking for someone with following interests/qualifications (note: you don't need to meet all the items listed, even a few would be great)\n\n-Trader(you have personally traded or invested in stocks in the stock market)\n\n-Familiar with financial metrics and reports\n\n-Familiar with XML and XBRL\n\n-Backend Developer\n\n-Frontend Developer(Javacript preferred)\n\n-XP with Python\n\nAbout me: I am in my 20s and work as Mobile App Dev for a big company (iOS/Android). My degree is in EE but switched to SW soon after graduating. I also trade frequently. I hate my job and am sick of the 9-5. \n\nI originally started this project to serve as a tool for myself, to help with me personal trading when analyzing companies. But I quickly realized this project has the potential to be a big money maker, as a tool like this is badly needed and can provide significant value to traders/investors.\n\nIf you are interested, DM me with some info about yourself and what you can do for this project.", "created_utc": 1579507468, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eraavp/lf_a_software_developer_trader_to_create_a/", "is_self": true}
