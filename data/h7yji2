I\u2019ve bought 09/16 options today morning at the top when when it\u2019s around $2610 expecting $3000 is close by a month or two. It tanked after I buy ,  may be because of so many state investigations opened that. I strongly think AMZN brush off all this and move upwards in coming weeks considering  e-commerce boom. What do you guys think? \n\nPositions 09/16 $2600C at $200", "created_utc": 1592014569.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h7yji2/amzn_to_3000/", "is_self": true}
