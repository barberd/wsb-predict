Now I\u2019m putting $1000 into my account and I\u2019m wondering how my options strategy should change. Before I would only buy far otm calls/puts because that\u2019s all I could afford. Should I now try to buy more ITM puts/calls? And I\u2019ve noticed that buying calls/puts a few months out is a lot less theta decay. Basically I\u2019m asking besides researching the companies and finding ones that are undervalued what kind of options should I buy now that I have some more money?
