I was asking him about CVS due to the amazing drop that\u2019s happened since last quarter and here are his findings.\n\nI\u2019m long at 5/17 55C, 6/21 57.5 and 60C\n\nHospital space, care and costs are one of the most prohibitive financially to bottom line growth. People do not trust pharmacies yet for care and this especially true in America. This merger as the CEO just said is going to pipeline all care to lower cost alternatives and start generating an ecosystem of care and profit.\n\nDeborah, 68, who has had her 6th flu this month, refuses to stop eating cake and lemonade at church on Sundays, continues to get sick and goes to the emergency room. This is expensive for Deb and hospitals. Deb hates going to the hospital but loves knowing everyone\u2019s name there. \u201cI\u2019m back again\u201d. Deb is poor supporting her family so you have no clue when she is going to pay her full bill despite insurance.\n\nDeb needs to simply get a prescription from a nurse practitioner at a CVS pharmacy, that can be filled at the CVS pharmacy right there. Quick bill for care, quick pharmacy fill, better patient time and outcome. Deb also has 21 grand children and two great grandchildren (use a condom in high school), she gets a bunch of pedalyte at the store too just in case. Win win win.\n\nYes, apparently pharmacists hate working at CVS and vent on Reddit. People vent about their daily jobs a lot. That isn\u2019t a reason to sell a stock.\n\nLet\u2019s say Deb is now not considering the hospital as her needs have been met this month. The hospital has less patients, costs can be cut with labor, and patients can be have better outcomes due to the increased attention. \n\nWhen they get out, they will get a discount with the prescriptions for going to CVS, and will generally enjoy the experience a great deal more. The hospital and CVS will communicate over getting the prescription filled immediately and you won\u2019t have to wait in the store mindlessly reading magazines listening to a meth head trying to get whatever they bought in breaking bad. \n\nThey just started selling CBD too, Millennials. \n\nNurse practitioners are also way cheaper than a random doctor doing clinical rounds for random sick people at the emergency room. \n\nAll the financial strengths can be found at seeking alpha.
