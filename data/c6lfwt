But here's another reason:\n\nJust talked to a senior sysadmin of a fairly large cluster. I asked if he was excited about AMD 7nm epyc chips and asked if they ordered any. The answer:\n\n\"No.\"\n\nI was a little surprised. In fact, they had actually just put in order for more Intel chips. Why? Because they use Intel compiler (software moat) and software which is optimized for Intel chips.\n\nSorry guys, but I'll repeat: AMD has NO chance. It's all smoke and mirrors which will come burning down in a few quarters when AMD, once again, will show no sustained revenue growth. Look at quarterly revenue for the last 10 years. Its a noisy horizontal line. These clusters don't want to switch to AMD, only to have to switch back to Intel again in a year when Intel gets their act together and drops their 10nm chips which crush AMD.", "created_utc": 1561735161, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c6lfwt/why_amd_will_fail/", "is_self": true}
