{"id": "fmmlaw", "title": "Long term DD for various stocks $TEVA $PG $TWTR $OXY", "selftext": "Whats up boys heres some of my DD for TEVA, Proctar &amp;amp; Gamble, Twitter, and Occidental Petroleum.\n\n$TEVA \n\n* Largest Generic Drug Manufacturer by a long shot. No Pharma company comes even close to their global manufacturing presence and capacity. Huge API supplier. With current increased demand due to the virus I expect API revs to be far greater than expected. Also a major manufacturer of Hydroxychloroquine which shows promising results in treating COVID19 with the use of antibiotics. They will donate 10 million doses of this drug and provide as many as necessary for clinical trials. **Maybe state AGs will drop the lawsuit with these large donations(opioid and price fixing)?** (EDIT: Definitely a long shot but why would a company donate to a govt that is suing them into bankruptcy?) They may not invent the \"cure\" but they may very easily be involved in the manufacturing of it when it arrives. With a global solid dose manufacturing presence and distribution they will be the best bet in delivering medicine to the patients during high demand. Also TEVA announced a few days ago that they have not had issues with supply chains during this time.

They have the smallest margins but are vital in our healthcare system. **If TEVA bankrupts the generic market will drastically inflate worldwide.** They saved US healthcare system over $40bn.

Vicks Dayquil, head+shoulders, charmin, mr. clean, oral b etc. **All of this stuff seems to be flying off the shelves due to panic. Maybe worth a gamble for Q1 ER.** \n\n$TWTR\n\n* In the past year twitter has vastly changed the way they both track ER and daily users. They have fixed ad. bugs from last year and have been ramping up ad revenue. Now they track mDAUs(monetizable daily active users) rather than DAUs to give investors an idea of how many users they actually make money on. **I expected a major Q1 ER beat on both numbers along with major increase in mDAUs. Virus trending constantly, people panicking to find out whats going on, politics, etc. and im still getting ads on my mobile**. I understand why the stock is down. Cutting ad expenses is the easiest way for companies to cut costs at times of economic downfall. I still think other companies are jumping in to advertise(i.e. entertainment). Im still getting ads. Can very easily be a $60 stock EoY. Im a fan of twitter and initiated a position this week will be slowly adding to it as we approach a bottom.\n\n$OXY\n\n* This is my gamble stock for this year. I expect CEO Vicki Hollub to be removed this week as Icahn took a major stake. Trump said to have plans on meeting with the oil guys to resolve the Russia/Saudi Arabia dick measuring contest. **Bonds updated to junk and people think bankruptcy is near considering that $30 a barrel is no where near sustainable. However, any positive news can rocket this back to the 30s.** \n\nCurious to hear anyone's thoughts on the above.", "created_utc": 1584824820.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmmlaw/long_term_dd_for_various_stocks_teva_pg_twtr_oxy/", "is_self": true}
