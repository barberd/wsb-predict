I'd be surprised if they're under 90. \n\nQ3 will have Fremont producing model Y in large quantities, and will have 10k+ a week of S3X. Giga Shanghai will be near 5k/wk 3 with Y coming online in September. Giga Berlin is going up faster than Shanghai. \n\nStock will be 1200+ next week after delivery numbers.
