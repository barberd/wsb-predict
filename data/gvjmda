Personal proof/experience.", "selftext": "Hello All, \n\nI wanted to draft this brief discussion to maybe shed some \ud83d\udca1 on the current situation. As we know, COVID has impacted retail severely. However, everyday we see stocks getting more and more green on hopes of a successful recovery. I am here to tell you that it is not going to happen. The damage isn\u2019t going to realized until a couple of more months. Don\u2019t believe me? Let me provide a few examples. \n\nLet me preface this by telling you that I am located in a state that \u201cfully\u201d opened in early May. \n\nBest Buy: Tried to go to here to buy a new TV and the store is still CLOSED. Only online orders and pick up. Correct me if I am wrong, but Best Buy relies heavily on foot traffic brick and mortar stores. Stock is still somehow up 29% this year! This is in a state that is declared fully OPENED! $BBY puts. \n\nIkea: Wanted to purchase a new desk, but the store is completely CLOSED. They only offer online order and pickup, but the pickup option on their website is BROKEN so I can\u2019t even buy a desk there if I wanted to. \n\n\nLet me remind you I am in a state that is FULLY open and still almost four months later the carnage continues. Parking lots are hardly full, people are NOT going to the stores as much, malls closed. \n\nI can only believe that other STORES and states are going to be hit much harder. A swift recovery is false. \n\n\ntl;dr COVID impact has a much bigger impact on retail than is being realized. Stocks are green in hopes of a full recovery, but that just isn\u2019t the reality. This will be realized a few months down the road, especially when Jerome stops \ud83d\udda8. \n\nThank you.", "created_utc": 1591144632.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gvjmda/in_regards_to_retail_are_things_going_to_turn_out/", "is_self": true}
