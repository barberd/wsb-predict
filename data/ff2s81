Outside of yoloing most of your portfolio (and I know this goes against everything this sub stands for), I\u2019d urge you to take at least *some* of your profits off the table to build a stable emergency fund (6-12 months to cover rent, food expenses, healthcare costs, etc.), make sure you\u2019re adequately supplied with non-perishable foods, medicine, and please heed ALL government warnings once they finally get their heads out of their asses. Fear and panic are going to make this situation worse, but there are a ton of very smart people working around the clock to figure out how to stop this. Wash your hands, keep your distance from people, and avoid large public gatherings.**\n\n**Background**\n\nGoing against the grain here because I don\u2019t think people are truly appreciating the scope of what we are up against, so this post will be quite serious. I\u2019m not posting a tl;dr of my diligence because I\u2019ve spent a significant amount of time researching this. I\u2019ve told my close family and any of my friends who would listen that this thing is just getting started. As some background, I\u2019ve worked in BB banking, megafund PE, and now at a hedge fund. I\u2019m prohibited from trading in any individual names due to firm compliance rules, so the majority of my positions are long-dated puts against the market. This post is mostly DD, but also part health advisory to keep you autists safe.\n\n**The Situation in Not Contained \u2013 Not Even Close**\n\nThe plurality of health experts researching Covid-19 agree that we\u2019ve moved well beyond any containment measures, and our best hope at this point is to slow the spread of the virus to reduce any impending strain on the supply chains, the healthcare systems, and avoid triggering any reactionary panics as long as we can. The WHO has not officially declared this as a \u201cpandemic\u201d (which is defined as a disease \u201cresulting from a new pathogen\u201d, meaning herd immunity is not built, expands rapidly through person-to-person transmission (i.e. community transmission), and spreads globally \u2013 we\u2019ve checked all three). Not sure if you\u2019ve followed any of the news, but we\u2019ve categorically hit all three criteria. It spreads rapidly and without detection because many cases are mild at least initially. This is a pandemic, full stop. \n\nOne of the main reasons we haven\u2019t officially declared it a pandemic is because it IS scary to think about, and there are complicated politics behind it. The WHO\u2019s main objective \u2013 despite what they outwardly state \u2013 is to assist national policy makers in handling outbreaks like this, and try to prevent fear and panic. \n\nChina, despite what the numbers coming out of there would indicate, is still in a very tenuous spot. Their initial reaction \u2013 which was the right one, imo \u2013 was measures of extreme containment. They implemented one of the most draconian quarantines in modern history in an effort to stave off unchecked spread of the virus. However, the containment failure happened very early, in all likelihood in late December/early January. Since then, most every country is going straight into community transmission because it\u2019s so hard to detect this thing early on. ~1-2 weeks ago, this thing exploded on a global scale. Cases popped up everywhere (Iran, South Korea, France, Japan, etc.). The list of countries where transmission was known to be local, i.e. no longer involving outsiders, rapidly expanded, and while the WHO was initially tracking that, they\u2019ve since taken that list down because there\u2019s no point. While some countries appear to have it under control because they aren\u2019t reporting a rapid expansion of cases along the same exponential curve as others, it\u2019s not because they\u2019re doing a better job containing, its because containment efforts have failed and they don\u2019t have enough testing resources to adequately track the virus\u2019s proliferation.\n\nSome countries (like South Korea) have taken Covid-19 incredibly seriously, and I believe the numbers coming out of there (still rapid spread, but a mortality rate at ~0.6% last I checked). Other countries with weak healthcare infrastructure and woeful government responses (see Iran) have had this virus flying around unchecked, and why it seems like complete pandemonium there. The epidemics OUTSIDE of China have followed the exponential growth paths that you\u2019d expect in this situation, with cases doubling globally every 5-6 days. We haven\u2019t heard much from countries in Africa, but I think its safe to assume that it\u2019s because the local health authorities haven\u2019t checked it yet. But if even somewhat developed countries are failing to contain it, then there\u2019s infinitesimally small hope that undeveloped/third-world countries will be able to.\nThe true case number is likely nowhere close to what\u2019s actually out there beyond China. In fact, it\u2019s likely off by orders of magnitude. It could range anywhere from 5x to 100x, depending on which specific country we\u2019re talking about. As long as cases are underreported, however, the growth path of reported cases should follow the exponential growth path of the actual cases (due to the multiplicative factor of doubling every 5-6 days), which is so far what we\u2019ve seen.\n\n**Why China\u2019s Figures Are Off**\n\nBased on the latest news coming out of China, their \u201creported\u201d case count and \u201cdeaths\u201d appear to be dropping relative to the exponential growth over the last few weeks. It seems like while the cases in the rest of the world are exploding, China\u2019s are defying logic and dropping. The reports in other countries are in direct opposition of what\u2019s going on in China. However, political leaders have every incentive to minimize the threat and panic, and point to China as if it\u2019s some apparent success, while entirely ignoring their draconian and extreme quarantine measures. They look at this and say \u201cChina successfully contained it, fears are overblown, stop panicking.\u201d This is not the flu. I think our best case right now is that Covid-19 would be comparable to some of the worst flu pandemics over the last century (please not I\u2019m not equating it to the Pandemic in 1918-1919, as we simply don\u2019t know enough about this just yet).\n\nWhat does this mean though? I\u2019d say, at best, China\u2019s extreme measures show that the transmission rates can be slowed somewhat, but they also haven\u2019t stopped them. Wuhan is still quarantined and things are on lock down. It\u2019s probably a safe assumption that infections and deaths are still growing in China, but the government there is severely underreporting it. And if you follow that logic \u2013 the CCP\u2019s numbers are as good as useless. Recall the early reports from ~6 weeks ago where the Tencent websites in Hong Kong and Taiwan appeared to show cases and death counts that were 10x what was actually being \u201creported\u201d. These figures were quickly taken down, and people were left puzzled. \n\nThe prevailing view is that the majority of those infected are not being reviewed or counted by authorities. This is because ~80% of cases are not serious, and are either asymptomatic or just mildly symptomatic. But remember \u2013 these people are still incredibly capable of spreading the disease, and arguably are even worse because they further allow the virus to spread unchecked and beyond the reach of healthcare / government workers.\n\nFurthermore, even if these people wanted to go get tested, they\u2019re being turned away from the Chinese healthcare system, due to a number of reasons: hospitals are full and not taking on any more patients, people are afraid of quarantine, there\u2019s potential for mistreatment, workers are stretched thin, or even that while they don\u2019t yet know if they have the virus, going to a hospital where many people definitively do have the virus, they risk acquiring it themselves.\n\nOf the people who have serious conditions, however, and still do go to the hospitals, what recourse do they have? And are they tested? The answer there is no \u2013 China\u2019s official party stance now is that healthcare workers don\u2019t label cases as positive until advanced tests are completed that demonstrate the virus\u2019s RNA sequence. The tests needed to complete this are incredibly expensive, complex and use a ton of resources. They also take a lot of time to be conducted, and hospitals/labels are already at 100% capacity. In other words, there\u2019s no reason to test people. A confirmed test result doesn\u2019t do much anyway, since it doesn\u2019t really affect treatment options. There is no vaccine or cure for the virus, so the goal is for treatment and alleviation of symptoms.\n\nThis explains why the line of known cases and deaths seemingly unexpectedly tapered off towards the end of February. It\u2019s also probably better for the general public at large to be ignorant of the true count because it could set off mass panic and fear. And while that\u2019s certainly a good thing because mass hysteria isn\u2019t helpful, it\u2019s important to note that it further allows the virus to spread again and again, which is the opposite of what you want in a pandemic situation. Again, containment and time for the healthcare system to absorb the shocks is the most important thing here. \n\n**Actual Case &amp; Death Figures in China**\n\nA lot of scientists, epidemiologists and doctors think the official case count AND death count is dramatically underestimated. This is both good and bad. While we\u2019ve posited above that the true case count is off by orders of magnitude (implying the death rate that we keep seeing, ranging from 1.5-3%, could potentially be much lower [which I\u2019d argue it\u2019s not]), the death count is also underreported. Obviously people who are dying are likely going to be dying in hospitals, but bear in mind that the way China reports deaths on death certificates is very different from the rest of the world. If a patient gets coronavirus, and then contracts pneumonia, then dies, the death certificate will read that Pneumonia is the cause of death. Additionally, patients are generally only tested early on in the virus\u2019s stages. By the time the symptoms have manifested, patients are already gravely ill and require ventilation and critical care. At this point there\u2019s no reason to test for the virus, and if these patients die, I highly doubt China is doing post-mortem testing to determine whether the patient actually had Covid-19. While the cause of death would be listed as \u201cpneumonia\u201d \u2013 which is actually the true cause \u2013 it in all likelihood was pneumonia brought on by the virus.\n\n**So What\u2019s Actually Going on in China?**\n\nI\u2019ve argued that the case count and death count is underrepresented so far. I\u2019ve also stated that most patients are mildly- or asymptomatic. There are videos out there where officials explain what\u2019s actually going on in Wuhan. The crematoriums are operating at max capacity. The official are actually taking bodies from homes at a much greater rate than from hospitals. I suspect we won\u2019t know the true counts of those dead coming out of Wuhan for years, if ever. The cause of death for most of these people are rarely listed as pneumonia, or suspected pneumonia. These officials are also under strict orders to not report the cases, so most of these videos are undercover. Many people suspect true cases and causes of death are only being reported at 5-10% of what the actual count is. \n\n**What Does this Mean for the Rest of the World and the US?**\n\nWell, probably that we are fucked. One of the very best reads I\u2019ve found on this to synthesize and crystallize just how severe this can be is from Liz Specht on Twitter. The thread can be found [here](https://twitter.com/LizSpecht/status/1236095180459003909). I promise it\u2019s worth your time to read the entire thing, but I\u2019ll try to summarize it in a few sentences here. Because testing and diagnostic cases are woefully inadequate to handle the current case count in the US, it appears as those we only have ~300 cases and ~20 deaths (implying a death rate of 6%, which we know not to be true, and simply way too high). In all likelihood, we probably have ~2,000 cases. We can expect an exponential growth curve, with cases doubling every 6 days. We\u2019ll be looking at 1mm cases by end of April, 2mm cases by early May, and 4mm cases a few weeks later, and so on. As the healthcare system begins to saturate under this case load, the system will be stretched and weakened incredibly quickly. Let\u2019s assume 10-20% of cases are severe enough to require hospital intervention. Conservatively, we\u2019re looking at ~400k beds needed by mid-May. We have ~1mm beds in the US. At any given time, we\u2019re using 65% of those beds, leaving ~350k beds for the nation. Bear in mind though that we\u2019re currently in flu season, so that number is probably much lower. By mid-May, our healthcare system will be swamped and over 100% capacity. Rx supply chains are already screwed, we don\u2019t have enough drugs, and people with chronic cases outside the coronavirus will suffer as well. We don\u2019t have enough supplies, we don\u2019t have enough beds, and we don\u2019t have enough healthcare workers to handle this. As Liz states, undeserved panic does nobody any good, but nor does ill-informed complacency. Even if some of these assumptions are wrong, we still get to the same place +/- a few weeks. What we need to do to the best of our ability is slow transmission because that\u2019s our best hope at containing this thing. The best possible thing we can do is try to reduce community spread because what we need more than ever is time \u2013 time to absorb the systemic shocks to the healthcare system, time to come up with a vaccine, and time to figure out our supply chain issues. The doubling will eventually peter out as more and more of the population is exposed to the virus, building immunity, but we haven\u2019t faced anything like this before. \n\nAnother great read is Carl Bergstrom, an epidemiologist at University of Washington. His thread can be found [here]( https://twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom/status/1236354030495883264). This explains the canceling of public events, the importance of social distancing, and trying our absolute best to prevent spreads. Whatever we can do to flatten the epidemic curve needs to happen, or else we will be screwed. I can\u2019t find the link now for some reason, but if you look at the US cities during other flu pandemics that canceled mass gatherings vs. those that didn\u2019t, the community transmission rates dropped dramatically, their healthcare systems absorbed the shocks much better, and death rates were 40-60% lower.\n\n**What Does This All Mean for the Population, the Economy, the Supply Chain, etc.?**\n\nConsider this. We have $14tn of consumer debt. Corporations have a ton of debt right now. Rates are at historical lows, with minimal room for further cuts. The emergency fed rate cut earlier this week was completely unexpected, and pretty intense. The markets have already priced in another 75bps cut for March. Taxes are already at historical lows thanks to Trump, and we\u2019re running $1tn deficits. Expect restaurants to shut down, travel to slow, supply chains to be disrupted, events to be canceled, etc.\n\nNote that this would be a worst-case scenario, but I have no faith in our current administration\u2019s ability to handle this health threat successfully because there\u2019s too much politicking going on. Politics are going to get in the way of solving this crisis, and that\u2019s bad for us. We are woefully under-equipped to handle this sort of thing unless serious intervention measures are introduced quickly.\n\n*Tl;dr buy purell, buy puts, heed warnings about staying home, don\u2019t touch your face, don\u2019t buy masks, and make sure you are prepared in case this thing gets much worse. Because I have a very bad feeling we just barely hit the iceberg on the Titanic.*", "created_utc": 1583620312, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ff2s81/the_situation_in_china_is_not_contained_we_are/", "is_self": true}
