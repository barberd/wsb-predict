{"id": "cbhquw", "title": "BYND Short Interest update", "selftext": "I hope everyone had a great 4th of July break!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nS3 is reporting that: \"BYND short interest is $885 mm; 5.61 mm shs shorted; 47.88% of float; 142% borrow fee &amp; new borrows at over 300% fee. There is very little left to borrow &amp; recalls are still hitting the street.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my calls to brokers I have found borrow rates creeping up from 106% on Friday, to 126% on Monday to 153% yesterday (with a range of 106-197% yesterday). I will update when I do my research calls today. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor those that didn't see my posts last week, I have basically taken my original cost basis off the table and am now just holding August $200 Calls. This is insanely risky, but I am playing with pure profits at this point. I still believe a short squeeze will happen, but we need to continue to see rising short borrow costs for that to happen. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs far as I know, no new QSRs or retail locations have been announced, but there was this interesting thread on Futurology Subreddit about people discussing fake meat. \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/ca6kyu/plantbased\\_meat\\_is\\_about\\_to\\_get\\_cheaper\\_than/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/ca6kyu/plantbased_meat_is_about_to_get_cheaper_than/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)", "created_utc": 1562770703, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cbhquw/bynd_short_interest_update/", "is_self": true}
