{"id": "hfssvo", "title": "AMD the Next NVDA??", "selftext": "Great future prospects, chips coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X, Ryzen 3 chips coming soon and better performance to Intel, what could possibly stop this rally? AMD right now feels like NVDA back in 2016, but in a much better place for long-term growth. Even Jim Cramer is saying buy. So although the bears will say P/E is super duper high, the future revenues are rapidly increasing so P/E valuation is meaningless right now. So, AMD to $100 or back to $30? You tell me. If Nikola is the next Tesla, why should AMD not be the next NVDA?", "created_utc": 1593114548.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hfssvo/amd_the_next_nvda/", "is_self": true}
