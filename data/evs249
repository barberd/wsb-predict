I've only like 60$ to play around with and am trying to learn the game correctly. Any general tips and pointers would be greatly appreciated. \n\nCurrently all in on ET, and I thought INO was going to the moon after hearing they were granted $9mill to develop vaccines for the KUNG FLU but since has dropped significantly after topping out at 5.80ish. They've dropped to a little over 4$ and i lost about 10-12$.\n\n I know this is kinda mediocre at best but i'd really appreciate any help.\n\n\\-$$$$$$$$$$$$$$", "created_utc": 1580327406, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/evs249/rookie_seeks_wsb_assistance/", "is_self": true}
