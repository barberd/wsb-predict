Got my brother on board and got a free FIT stock out of the deal, come 5 days from now I'll take that sweet 3$ and pick up some super OTM spy puts when the market is right.  \n\n\nAnyways, I showed my brother how to trade options (click that you know what youre doing yada yada) and asked him what his first play is going to be. He's doing 9/20 11 puts on USO.  \n   \nSince first one is always free, just use someone elses first one plays to always make free money. SEC can't stop me from breaking the rules they set up in the first place.\n\nRide forth to tendie town my brothers", "created_utc": 1568612470, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d4wesm/oil_dd_cant_go_tits_up_guaranteed_money/", "is_self": true}
