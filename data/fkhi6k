{"id": "fkhi6k", "title": "Some Scoop on Auto OEMs", "selftext": "Hello i am retarded so I don't know how to profit off this but maybe one of you polysomic helmet-wearers can. A family friend is C-Suite at one of the top 3 American Auto OEMs supplying Ford, GM, etc.   \n\n\nHe's banging my Mom and let slip that there was a big meeting today where the industry heads arrived at the decision to freeze OEM production for at least 6 weeks, announcement TBD but very soon. So how do I turn these ghost transmissions into tendies? (He usually let's my Dad pay rent on the room above the garage a bit late, but demanded it on time this week so I know he is worried.)  \n\n\nHere is my attempt at DD, let me know if I should change to DD flair:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Domestic OEMs that sell to car companies: lay-offs, slashed expectations, bad press due to lay-offs and slashed expectations, panic when customers realize they might have to buy a steering wheel off of a Benihana menu, etc. So, short the OEMs? But we already know auto industry is fucked, so this type of news is probably priced in but might cause a dramatic dip in the near-term, yeah?   \n\n\n\\- Car companies: pretty much same as above, except the 1 month chart for all these companies kinda look like when you throw a baseball and no one catches it so it just hits the ground. Is it possible for these stocks to go negative? Should I wait until the share price is negative so they have to pay me to assume the risk of the stock?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- NWL: Newell Brands, the owner of Elmer's Glue. When Henry Ford said faster horses or w/e we weren't in a recession. Well guess what we are in a recession. We will probably have more horses on the streets because we have less cars (there is a historical precedent that these goods are direct replacements if you compare DoD data). More horses on the streets = more dead horses = more glue supply. Shitty foreign car parts = need glue to keep the cars stuck together = more revenue. Maybe throw 3M in there cause I think they make car glue, idk if you need a different type of horse for that though? I know it's a different horse from wood glue.   \n\n\nThoughts?
