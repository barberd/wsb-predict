Higher interest rates should drive demand for that currency, thus making it more valuable over time, while a lower interest rate implies expectations that the currency is highly demanded now and thus will lose value over time. What two currencies can we use as an example of UIP right now? That's right the USD and the EUR. EUR has an interest rate of 0 and despite the Donald and corporate cuck JPow dropping the interest rates every time they finish on each other the US Fed has the interest rate between 1% and 1.25%, meaning the dollar should be getting more valuable with respect to the Euro over time. Furthermore, this cluster fuck bear market is driving people to the dollar for liquid security and when people wake the fuck up and realize it's time to buy oil again they're going to need even more dollars. What you need to remember for step 2 is that the USD is good and you want more of it, the EUR is going to continually lose value over the next several months.\n\n**\\*Step 2)\\*** Carry trades are when you take a loan out at a low interest rate and invest in something that will yield a higher return. If you ever earn enough to move out of your mom's basement you'll take out a mortgage on a house at interest rate X expecting the house to appreciate at a rate of X+Y meaning you can pay back the mortgage and still come out ahead. Another way to do it is to take out a loan at a low interest rate and put that shit into your portfolio, YOLO it to the moon, and pay it back later.\n\n\\***Step 3)\\*** Combine the two. Take out a loan in EUR knowing it will be cheaper to pay it back later, transfer those EUR to USD and invest that shit. Then use a paltry amount of your winnings to pay back that super low interest eurozone loan and save all the difference for yourself. But Zodiach, where would I take out a EUR denominated loan? Fucking Montenegro you normie bitch. They're in the eurozone and desperately seeking any form of investment.  Not naming names but their biggest banks will offer you 20k EUR on a 4 month term at as low as 1% interest. Surely you guys think you can get more than 1% return on any money you borrow? Moreover, the EUR has depreciated significantly over the last month and will only continue to do so now that the Italians are dropping dead waiting in line for pasta and the French and Spanish are next to fall, the UK is going into lock down cutting out their demand for EUR, no tourists are showing up in peak season,  and no one in China wants products made in Germany or Poland right now while their sweatshops in China are on lockdown and no one is getting paid. So suddenly that 1% is closer to 0% and maybe even negative. That's right, the loan may be less than the current EUR/USD spot rate right now even if all you do is sit on it for the next 4 months. \n\nTLDR: Get your EUR loan from Montenegro, move it to USD, put your money where your mouth is as you short the shit out of this bear market, and bask in the glory of finally hitting your personal risk tolerance before paying back those sad sack europeans with their own depreciated monopoly money", "created_utc": 1584750084.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fm5x5m/free_money_for_your_yolo_options/", "is_self": true}
