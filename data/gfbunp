{"id": "gfbunp", "title": "$ELY $GOLF $DS Kill marry fuck", "selftext": "The golf industry is one of the weird ones during this pandemic. There was a crash in early March, and a subsequent recovery that has mirrored the overall market. The thing is, 50% of golf courses never closed. People never quit playing, and tee times have anecdotally been more difficult to get in golfing hot spots like AZ, NC, SC, GA, and FL. Granted, lots of those golfers will die of coronavirus due to their age and affinity for cigars, but I'm here to play a stupid game, not mourn boomers: \n\n&#x200B;\n\nKill: $DS\n\nThis company is actually cool, it kind of takes the experience Top Golf provides and twists it toward arcade-style (hit balls in a simulator instead of into RGB buckets on a driving range. They sell lots of beer, which is an extremely profitable activity. But, like every place that used to sell beer, they are fucking closed. Can't make money if your doors aren't open. They fired, like, everyone. They already repaid the free-money-if-you-rehire-your-old-employees-loan, in full, so they aren't fucking rehiring anybody. This company is going bankrupt. Earnings is today, BUY SOME PUTS. \n\nFuck: $ELY\n\nCallaway golf is firmly cemented in the top 2 golf brands in the world in every category. Except apparel. Golf clothes are ugly and no one seems to get this... people don't buy ugly clothes. This company overreached last year, buying multiple apparel brands and bringing them in house, and each choice was an act of self immolation. But fire is hot, and hot means fuckable. This stock dropped from $22.00 to $5 in mid-March, and if you were smart like me, you knew it wasn't going bankrupt and made 300% back to-date on SHARES. It's under $14, still a buy 100%. They report earnings TONIGHT. I recommend buying some shares, 6-8  month time horizon before they recover to \\~$19 which is historically a strong resistance for the stonk. Options on this are low volume and I wouldn't recommend, but maybe sell OTM puts to your friends. \n\nMarry: $GOLF\n\nTHis is Titleist. Titleist is 3rd in terms of golf club sales, but super duper #1 in ball sales. They had a down couple of years IMO bc Costco employees stole material and printed 'Kirkland' on the balls and sold them for half price (fucking hilarious story, btw). Now the lawsuit is really humming along and $GOLF is back at its all time high. No other company will ever make a ball that competes with the Pro V1. This is a buy any time you see the share price below $25. Buy it to own it, like Apple.
