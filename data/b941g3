This targets millenials who piss away money on shoes, vaping, monster energy, and coolers.  \n    \nMNST - Chad's run on this shit.  It flows through their veins.    \n  \nYETI - Chad has to keep those Monsters cold, and only the best cooler will do for the nector of the monster.    \n    \nNKE &amp; ADDDF - Chands sneaker addiction cannot be contain by a single stock.  This also blends with the slav lifestyle, which is Chad's 'cool' uncle, who bought him booze before he was 21.   \n   \nPM - Philip Morris - if you can't see why this is a good idea Chads vape cloud must be blocking your vision.        \n   \nMAA - Every Chad eventually has to leave his parents house, and he will be renting with his kind of spending habits. So let's play rental REITs ftw.      \n\nSo that's the lineup.
