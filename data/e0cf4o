Over the weekend there are FIT calls for $119 with a strike price of $6.19. The share prices are at $6.85. My question is what is stopping me from just buying a bunch of those options quick and selling out IMMEDIATELY and cashing out on the $66 per call?", "created_utc": 1574480042, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e0cf4o/call_question/", "is_self": true}
