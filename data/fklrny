{"id": "fklrny", "title": "After this week, the easy money's over", "selftext": "For the last few months, everyone here has been recommending buying puts on XYZ sector company trying to time the cascade, when in reality the sector by sector collapse was somewhat hit or miss, but the main advantage that existed was that we knew this virus wasn't some rando anomaly that would go away, and that the drop was going to be sharper and faster than the big money boys on wall street figured from scraping sentiment on their Bloomberg terminals.\n\nThings are different now. Volatility is dummy high, I was thinking of buying Tesla puts after Elon's dumbass email, and if you buy April ITM puts, the share price needs to drop 15-20% to fucking break even. It would need to go to half for you to get close to tripling your money (who the fuck cares about that post). \n\nThe only remaining unknown ECONOMIC variables for the virus is if it will or will not collapse the medical system and how long self self-isolation will last. The answer is yes, and probably 4-8+ months. These are the edges us morons have. The problem is that now, with only a few remaining long term variables, the big plays in the next 2 months are going to be predominantly related to debt, defaults, and ultimately, unemployment. Problem is none of us know fuck all about how that affects the economy compared to Goldman Sachs, and you WILL NOT have an edge with your $30 premium LYV puts. Now is the time to appreciate your yolo spy put money, relish in it, and start thinking of EXTREMELY long term (3-6 months) plays that might yield 3-4x return. The FD's are over for the intelligent (relatively) bears, but If you think we're going into a recession/depression, that is NOT priced in. If you think we're going to suffer for a few months, take some hits, and come out the other side, then save your money for calls on the other side. \n\nOnly thing left for bear gang is DEEP, LONG puts on SPY, Real estate, and some yolo move likes earning report calls for video game companies that have additional upside after earnings. \n\nTL:DR \n\nMay or June ATVI $65 call - Warzone and everyone at home\n\nOct VNQ $40 put  - Literally no one is leaving their home and they'll have no job or money.
