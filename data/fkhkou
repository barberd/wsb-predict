Example:  retailers have fallen 50-75%.  Majority has come in past two days.  Dbi has fallen from 9.90 on Friday to 4.08 today.  Average price over past 5 years is $20 and recently has been $16. They will have 2 bad quarters due to virus but people will not sit at home for a year.  \nCurrent stock price is pricing them for bankruptcy which will not happen.  If you have a GF or wife you know of DSW.  \nAnyways, stock is wayyyyyy oversold, as are a lot of retailers.  Go long 2022 leaps and at end of this year when they release 2021 guidance you\u2019ll be sitting on a multibagger.", "created_utc": 1584496361.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkhkou/how_much_bad_is_factored_in/", "is_self": true}
