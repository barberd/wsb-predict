Ever since I started doing this one thing I\u2019ve been able to make less-retarded predictions of future price action without trying to predict the potential impact of news events, stimulus packages, all that blah blah blah fundamental noise that I see all over the place.   \n\n\n**Here\u2019s the secret:** look at the fucking charts.   \n\n\nNow I know many of you high schoolers struggle to understand any chart that\u2019s more complicated than the line graph you usually watch on Robinhood, so I\u2019ll try my best to keep that in mind.  \n\nI\u2019ve been trading using technical analysis and only using technical analysis because I find that fundamentals are widely bullshit in the current market atmosphere. A company misses earnings by -1000% and their stock goes to infinity. Another company beats earnings by 1000% and their stock goes to shit. Covid-19 kills 100k people and shuts down the world economy  yet we are seeing a net loss of only \\~17% overall and headlines that read  \"best one day gains in S&P500\" \"best weekly gains since forever ago\".\n\nThe markets are fucking rigged and completely irrational.  \n\nAt some point I was also a gay bear hoping to buy puts & make mad tendies just like you. That was until I realized that I\u2019m an idiot for trying to fight the trend.   \nThe markets have been strongly bullish recently and that\u2019s clear. So why try to fight against the trend by expecting price to go down when it keeps going up? Its obviously not working out.\n\n I\u2019ve had a bullish outlook since March 31st (albeit initially price didn\u2019t move exactly as I predicted)\n\nproof: [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/SPY/LCGgS7th-SPY-The-Trend-Is-Your-Friend-Why-NOT-To-Short-Just-Yet/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/SPY/LCGgS7th-SPY-The-Trend-Is-Your-Friend-Why-NOT-To-Short-Just-Yet/) \n\nThen on April 3rd I predicted this week\u2019s +13% bull run to a T\n\nproof: [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/SPX500USD/Nh1jfPT7-SPX500-Fibonacci-Analysis-Support-Found-at-382-Retracement/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/SPX500USD/Nh1jfPT7-SPX500-Fibonacci-Analysis-Support-Found-at-382-Retracement/)\n\n  \nAll of my forecasts are based purely on the charts & TA. I use to focus more on Forex analysis and I only just recently began to pay attention to the major stock indices, which goes to show that TA can be used across all the financial markets. \n\nSo what\u2019s my advice? Pay more attention to the charts. Learn to read them and understand price action and market psychology. We might not have access to all the insider information that big Wall Street traders and politicians have, but the one thing we all share in common is the same charts. \n\ntl,dr: The trend is your friend. Learn to read the fucking charts.\n\nbtw SPY to 290 at least. Probably even higher, who knows. I want to see a short squeeze of the century happen to get all the dumb money out before I even consider buying puts again.", "created_utc": 1586555188.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fyplue/do_you_tards_even_look_at_the_fucking_charts_how/", "is_self": true}
