Let's kick up the put volume and drag it down so they don't feel like they missed out on profits.\n\nMarket is closed, I have no positions. I'll be jumping in tmmw or Monday. Jump in at your own peril.\n\nThey're selling individual companies in their portfolio. Below are a few I've found. Looks like a few of them have done tremendously well throughout this bear market.\n\nORCL  \nCTXS  \nAMZN (very small position from what I understand)  \nDD  \nCME  \nCVX\n\nStrike - closer to the money, the better.  \nExpiry - hmm... let's meme 5/20.
