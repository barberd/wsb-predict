{"id": "fxkud3", "title": "This is what is actually going on.", "selftext": "If you look at where SPY is currently trading, we're 6% away from where the market was trading on October 9, 2019, months before this all went to shit and Pokimane killed the market in the dark Jartek days, which makes no god damn sense so I figured, let's see what's going on.  Now, we're looking at shit earnings for at least for the next 2-3 quarters, around 10-20% of the S&P 500 becoming insolvent, depression level unemployment, possible lockdown cycle for the next year or two, a huge supply and demand shock, etc..., but apparently JPow printed the recession away.  At this point, even JPow has to be looking at the Nasdaq, which is now trading at a \"CNBC once in a decade\" buying opportunity last seen since...December of 2019...and thinking, \"fuck, maybe I did print too much money?\"\n\nBulls are already to type \"Markets are forward looking.\"  The Nasdaq lost about 75% of if it's value from 2000 to 2001, if the market was perfect we wouldn't be going up and down like a penny stock.  The market is breathing a sigh of relief that there's no liquidity crisis, and the fed can buy all the shitty bonds and do all the QE it wants, but it can't solve a solvency crisis where tons of these companies are essentially going to go broke.  It doesn't take all that much to start a recession, your wife's boyfriend loses some hours at work, you don't get a raise, all of a sudden everyone tighten's their belt and a recession is here, and we have that on absolute steroids right now.  The checks and PPP don't help if there's no where to spend it and no one comfortable with spending money, just look at Japan.  So what explains the recent price action?\n\nI'm gonna steal this from Nomura's quant desk as to the recent price action:\n\n\"The steep rally in global equities looks to us like a \u201cbear squeeze\u201d rally, powered by exits from bearish positions that investors accumulated during the downturn. Investor sentiment does seem to be finding support in signs that the virus\u2019s spread in Europe and the US is on course to peak and start slowing, but this was already set to be a week in which CTAs were likely to back out of short positions in US equity futures, so we think it is best to assume that the rally is largely technically driven. It is not clear yet whether the market gains will hold up once the bear squeeze has run its course. We think that projecting scenarios based on longerterm fundamentals onto the present market is something best avoided. The squeeze on CTAs\u2019 short positions has been led by speculative investors recently making contrarian trades, and here we would single out absolute return funds and eventdriven funds, both of which favor short-term trades with a strong element of seizing on opportunities. It appears to us that a powerful wave of contrarian trades by quickmoving investors such as these has left trend-chasing CTAs without an incentive to stick with their short-term bear trades.\n\nIt may help here to look in detail at CTAs\u2019 positions in US equity futures markets. We estimate that CTAs\u2019 net short position as in S&P 500 futures is now about 20% smaller than it was at its 3 April peak. We think that the S&P 500 could rise to around 2,700 if CTAs were to exit their short position in its entirety. Similarly, we estimate that CTAs\u2019 net short position in DJIA futures has shrunk by about 11%. Should CTAs continue being squeezed out of their short positions, we think the DJIA could rise to around 24,000. The pace of CTAs\u2019 exits from short positions in Russell 2000 futures (RTY) has been especially swift. We estimate that their aggregate net short position here is already about 45% smaller than it was at the 31 March peak. Meanwhile, CTAs are still leaning long on NASDAQ 100 futures, as before.\n\nIt looks as though CTAs are being forced into unwinding short positions in equity futures markets across Europe. We estimate that CTAs\u2019 net short position in the especially important DAX futures market is about 40% smaller now than at the latest peak. At the risk of repeating ourselves, however, the short-covering by CTAs that we are seeing has a strongly technical flavor. Given that the bottom is falling out of Germany\u2019s real economy, we do not see much happening besides speculative players being ejected from bearish positions. It looks unlikely to us that the momentum behind CTAs\u2019 exits from short positions will actually carry them into turning bullish. We also estimate that CTAs are in the process of covering short positions in most major agricultural commodity futures markets. They have already swung net long on CBT wheat futures and CBT soybean meal futures\"\n\nSo that's a lot of words and half of you have no clue what the hell that means.  There's no fancy crayon lines, it's just a simple bull trap due to shorts covering.  Ackman was actually right with his CNBC bullshit, hell is actually still coming.  \n\nSPY 5/15 260p", "created_utc": 1586402288.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxkud3/this_is_what_is_actually_going_on/", "is_self": true}
