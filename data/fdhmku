Looking at his trading history it appears that he is suffering from a severe lapse in judgement. I'm seeing Microsoft FDs, calls on triple-leveraged China ETFs, and almost daily $5 deposits with 'I sucked a dick for this' in the memo field. Last week he called our customer service to ask how to get 'infinite leverage' and then suggested that he was being anally penetrated by a bear. Has he suffered a stroke recently?\"", "created_utc": 1583347644, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fdhmku/tda_looking_out_for_dementia_patients_scam/", "is_self": true}
