Even as the market raged over that period, tariffs went in dry on these poor guys.  In May, support seemed to stabilize around $21.30.  \n\n\nAt this time last year, AA was trading at $47.  In April of 2018 (prior to Trump's March 1 tariff announcement) AA was at $60.  Thru most of 2000 thru 2008, AA traded between $60 and $90.\n\n\nJust as new construction started to take off with Trump's election and tax breaks, AA started to takeoff approaching prior glory of $60+ before the tariff slow bleed back to $21.\n\n\nSo during May's overall tumble, AA stabilizes around $21.  Today's vaguely optimistic Trump tweet about China saw AA spike 5%.\n\n\nI started averaging in at $25...have held thru the continued slide.  I am hoping we've found the floor and are beginning the rebound.  Although it may be impossible to time a trade deal, given the preamble, AA ought to be poised for significant growth thereafter.\n\n\n------\n\n\nBrief history on AA.  These guys supply a lot of aluminum to GM, Boeing, etc, and also produce aluminum components for new building construction.  They have an annual revenue of $11.6bn  They literally invented aluminum smelting a 130ish years ago and were founded 1888.  Their Pittsburgh chemistry experiment was financed by Andrew Mellon, an Ambassador to the UK and Treasury Secretary for 3 different Presidents.  They've been the consistent leader in their industry since inventing it and are the largest smelter in North America today.", "created_utc": 1560885328, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c26h9z/aa_aluminum_rebound_is_inbound/", "is_self": true}
