Calls or puts, specifically short dated ones and otm gives you the power to decide when and on what you enter for huge gains.\n\nA basic understanding of support levels will ensure your entries are at the right time. And other basic charting understanding. The other requirement is to only play good company tickers (no pharma, weed, etc).\n\nDid you know that half a percent movement can make you 100% gains? Did you know averaging down near a support level (esp in a market like this) is arbitrage as long as you stick to your plan? It's because it will bounce off (and by bounce off all it needs to move is half a percent). And you will get your 100%+ gains.\n\nStop FOMO. Be patient and enter positions at your own speed. You're not missing out on anything by ignoring TSLA, or not playing that PTON dip, or even by not jumping on the LK or BYND bandwagon. Stop. Breathe.
