Then you just wait. If the market goes in opposite direction, you make the same play but at better pricing delayed (account for theta decay as well) \n\nSo in today's example, people are bullish on MSFT. If MSFT drops tomorrow morning, I can buy the same calls people are advocating today, but for cheaper.  You see, I am better than WSB and I will only invest if I can get a better deal than you.\n\nYes, you risk missing out entirely if WSB is right on something from the beginning, but by forcing you to be patient and more selective I find it leads to a higher win %.", "created_utc": 1580946626, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ezj1gr/the_only_better_bets_than_wallstreet_bets_option/", "is_self": true}
