This stock has had regular pullbacks since it started rallying from it's earnings dip. Expecting profit taking and a pullback tomorrow.\n\nLYFT\nOkay, this is a bit risky because it already dropped 10% today. I expect this to keep dropping for the rest of the week. Autists who want to invest in ride hailing services will be wanting to buy UBER rather than LYFT, so they will probably hold out for UBER since IPO is so close. The best way to hedge bets for people, institutions who already got their hands on UBER stock is to short LYFT, because they can't sell their UBER  stock because of the lockdown period. The lower this goes the more UBER investors panic expecting similar behavior from UBER and short this.\n\nAlso, looks like most of us expect Trump tariffs to punch the market in the face on Friday, so that should only help these bets.", "created_utc": 1557363298, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bmddto/team_and_lyft_puts_for_tomorrow/", "is_self": true}
