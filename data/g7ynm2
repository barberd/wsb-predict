{"id": "g7ynm2", "title": "CALENDAR SPREADS", "selftext": "I have a question about trading calendar spreads that maybe someone can help clarify. I watched a video about some theta gang dude doing LEAP calendar spreads and making $200,000 a year on them and still keeping his original call he bought. He would buy an option one year out at the strike price then he would continue to sell contracts weekly that were slightly OTM for the remainder of the year. My question is this. \n\nSay ABC is trading at 50 right now. I by a LEAP CALL one year out at the strike price of 50 then I sell a weekly CALL option at 52. The stock stays at 50 and my shorted CALL expires worthless and I keep the premium for that week. Now assume the price the next week goes down 3 points so I sell a CALL contract at 48. The stock stays at 47 and I keep the premium for that week. The stock continues to drop another 3 points the next week down to 44. Should I just keep my original LEAP Call at 50 which is losing value as the stock drops or should I replace it with a CALL that\u2019s closer to the stock price? Perhaps slightly hovering my LEAP a lil big OTM", "created_utc": 1587839612.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7ynm2/calendar_spreads/", "is_self": true}
