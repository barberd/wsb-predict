On a positive note, I have collected $2320 since then selling FDs against it.  \n\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/rdQNGjy](https://imgur.com/a/rdQNGjy)  \n\n\nI told myself I'm not selling this fucker until it hits $50k in value (unless after May 1st, then I'll settle for $40k in value).. else it will expire worthless. Diamond hands bitches.
