If we assume only 10% do with BFA selling at 63$ that's the same money as almost another 4 months of subscriptions, the money from subscription-based games is god tier.\n\nThere is content in the game that requires players to play together in a 40 man group consistently on a weekly basis clearing bosses to farm for 1% drops it's incomprehensible the amount of time and grinding Classical WoW has in it these people will be ENTHRALLED.\n\n [https://i.redd.it/go9opn4fkmh31.png](https://i.redd.it/go9opn4fkmh31.png) \n\n [https://i.redd.it/h30ou6w47sg31.png](https://i.redd.it/h30ou6w47sg31.png) \n\nRight now when I log in to Classic Wow there are 6 servers registering as FULL let alone all the high population and mediums aaaand, **this is just in NA the Europeans are even more crazy about games think about all the Competitive E-sports teams from the Scandanavian regions those guys go HARD af and their WoW players are just the same competing for world firsts with everyone else.**\n\nA full server back then would have around 10k+ players on it blizzard has already stated servers will hold more players than before because of the layering system they've built which allows multiple people to play in the same areas without causing disruption to gameplay because of competition over quest spawns etc. \n\n**So just in players that have logged in to secure their name the numbers are already over 100k.**\n\nThere are people who've taken weeks off of work to dedicate to playing, they're flying around the world to meet with old guildmates and planning on binging on take out and neglecting sleep. We're talking practically the most addicting game ever released, just think about that 12 million sub peak. That was 12 million people paying 14.99$ a month JUST TO PLAY A GAME. This shit is not a joke, the video games industry is already overtaking the entertainment industry don't underestimate these companies.\n\nThey may draw scandals but take it from me a player that's lived through many game company scandals, it didn't stop me from buying and it didn't stop me from playing. We're all addicted to this shit and it's a low maintenance cash cow.\n\n***This isn't even taking into consideration CoD Mobile numbers and Diablo Immortal Numbers, I'll be doing a major post on those two games probably early September as when Classic drops I'll be streaming it for 2 weeks straight myself.***\n\n**ATVI 50$ Incoming**\n\n**^(Spoonfed trades:)** \n\n^(50$ ATVI 8/23 calls) \n\n^(50$ ATVI 8/30 Calls) \n\n^(50$ ATVI 11/15 Calls)\n\n^(This isn't financial advice blah blah, do your own DD, something something inverse wsb.)", "created_utc": 1566400205, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cti6rb/classic_wow_the_numbers_atvi_50_incoming/", "is_self": true}
