I believe that with their growth rate slipping on revenue they will not be able to meet the expectation. I seem to be in the minority on this as everyone seems to be expecting a great earnings and maybe even a beat.  I just wanted to hear from people who are thinking SHOP will beat or what you think will happen on earnings. (Feb 12th before market open)\n\nThe specifics of my logic is based on the fact that Q4 growth seems to be slowing about 20% every year with the last 3 years being 85% (2016), 71% (2017), and 54% (2018). I think its realistic to think we would actually see a growth of around 34% which would translate into roughly $472M which is below the estimates range of revenue which is 475.45M - 493.14M.\n\nSo come on bulls tell me how my options are gonna end up worthless. IDC I'm holding.\n\nRevenue charts: [https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/SHOP/shopify/revenue](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/SHOP/shopify/revenue)\n\nEstimates: [https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/SHOP/detailed-estimates](https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/SHOP/detailed-estimates)", "created_utc": 1580341966, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/evvsm7/buying_shop_puts_into_earnings/", "is_self": true}
