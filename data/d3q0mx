{"id": "d3q0mx", "title": "Home Depot is going down", "selftext": "Last week I spotted a rising channel pattern in CME and HD. I saw it played out beautifully in CME after it crashed off of its upper channel, which is where HD is right this moment. Go to finviz and enter HD to see this and compare with CME. \n\nHd is also at close to its all time high, earnings are over, and the retards clamoring about hurricane clean up tendies have shot this stinker too high, too fast. Earnings were ok. The company is ok. But it\u2019s overextended and needs to breathe. \n\nI\u2019ll be playing this with the 11/15 250/255 vertical credit. I suppose you could make it a condor with the 205 puts but the premium is about 3x less than the call side. Also, the mango effect makes put risk greater than usual so I don\u2019t think shorting puts is a wise plan in anything.", "created_utc": 1568384751, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d3q0mx/home_depot_is_going_down/", "is_self": true}
