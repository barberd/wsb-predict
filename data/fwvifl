I do NOT care that i should not be driving because my car is running on fumes, i have shitty windshield wipers, and i lost my license because of a fairly recent DUI. \n\nCan I get an Amen? \n\nTLDR: AZO calls for any strike/exp that you can get for around $666.", "created_utc": 1586303201.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fwvifl/sickle_cell_covid420/", "is_self": true}
