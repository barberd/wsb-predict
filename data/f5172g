NVO JUST broke out of a 5 year long overhead resistance. This could be the start of a massive supercycle breakout, or something smaller, but the relevant info is that the breakout is happening NOW.\n\nGoing by past price action, even 'smallish' breakouts ALWAYS lead to a swift $10 breakout. The level of the breakout was $60. Stock is sitting at $63.45 right now, so we should expect to see $70 quite soon.\n\nThis is a stock that has been mired for years in a fairly consistent range, so options are pretty cheap.\n\nFor the more risk averse, June $62.50 calls are just $3.40\n\nFor those who love to YOLO, March 20th, 70 Calls are just .10 cents\n\nTl;dr : March 20th 70 Calls NVO at .10", "created_utc": 1581904568, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f5172g/nvo_novo_nordisk_call_options/", "is_self": true}
