Since I started trading I was doing somewhat okay but then I found this subreddit and have been taking a great deal of pleasure in this orgy of ours. But, I've lost about 400k or more - I haven't added it all up- trading SPY, AAPL, MSFT, TSLA , and MU among others for the past 3 years. This hasn't harmed me as my buisnesses have been able to take the brunt of it and while I have had a blast paying less in taxes every year, I think it's time for me to stop before I'm lining up among you fags sucking cock for a buck down at the Wendy's. I'm off to r/investing to live a boring fucking existence. But who knows? Maybe when I'm 40 I will yolo everything on some SPY FD Calls but who knows?\n\nTLDR; My ass is red and sore from being fucked without lub from FDs. Down around 400k+ for the past 3 years. Time to move to r/investing to get away from all yall fags.", "created_utc": 1592451085.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hb6sgz/fuck_this_shit_im_out/", "is_self": true}
