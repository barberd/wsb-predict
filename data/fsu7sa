It\u2019s actually better if you don\u2019t read and just listen to the pretty videos!\n\nWatch this:   https://youtu.be/5OFaZcC0lRU\n\nThen watch this:   https://youtu.be/JptfIK4mR6w\n\nFor those of you that CAN read (why are you here here again?) here is my analysis of the videos:\n\nThe US baby-boomer population holds a large portion of their retirement funds in equities.  (Much larger portion than their peers in Europe)\n\nThe baby boomer retirement wave is just beginning, and will ramp up over the next 5-10 years. They will typically sell high-risk equities (stocks) first, to fund retirement, before tapping other asset classes. Simultaneously, their consumption rates will drop significantly, lowering revenue for many companies.   If demand for equities does not increase, this will result in falling stock prices.  \n\nThe following generations are smaller, with comparatively lower per-capita consumption rates for the same age as the previous generations. Therefore, consumption by younger generations will not be enough to offset the loss of consumption from the baby boomer generation.\n\nIn a vacuum, this would be the hypothesis of the retirement crisis: It is likely that equity markets stagnate over the next 10 years.   \n\nHowever, we are simultaneously encountering a dollar liquidity crisis.   This is caused by two things:\n1.  A large portion of sovereign debt is denominated in USD, and a large chunk of that will reach maturity over the next 3-5 years.   Countries need USD to pay back and/or service this debt.   \n2.   Foreign entities are buying up USD as a reserve currency in face of the recession.   \n\nThe liquidity crisis could ignite a positive feedback loop of foreign institutions buying USD and US Equities, to hedge against the devaluation of their own currencies, which in turn further inflates the US market.    This phenomenon is explained by Brent Johnson\u2019s \u201cDollar Milkshake Theory\u201d in the second video.   \n\n[Side note:  This rush to US markets during global recessions is the mechanism which allows the Fed to print money disgusting amounts of money without causing hyper-inflation.]\n\nSo the retirement crisis (which stagnates/lowers the equity markets) and the liquidity crisis (which inflates the equity markets) might counteract each other.    \n\nThe question becomes which is bigger?    Will the sell off of equities by the baby boomers be offset or exceeded by the increased foreign demand for USD and US equities?\n\nTL;DR:   Use the videos as background noise to drown out the sound of your wife fucking her boyfriend.    You might learn something through osmosis.  \n\nPosition:   $ZM 160c 5/1  because my parent\u2019s boomer friends have miraculously learned how to use it, thus expending their abilities to learn new software for the next decade.", "created_utc": 1585722348.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fsu7sa/why_future_us_equity_growth_will_be_almost/", "is_self": true}
