{"id": "f4i3aw", "title": "Queen Predicted Virgin Galactic Parabolic Growth", "selftext": "Not many people know this, but Freddie Mercury predicted that SPCE would go parabolic and stay that way, quite a long time ago. Its just taken this long for us to realize it.\n\nIn 1978, Queen released \"Don't Stop Me Now\", which prophesized several key events of Virgin Galactics climb to glory, and the inevitability of its success, along with a hidden message to future generations encoded in its release date.\n\n\"Tonight, I'm gonna have myself a real good time\" Clearly here you can see the many weekends of strippers and blow which are being funded,and will continue to be funded by Virgin Galactics ATHs, especially when they fall on fridays.\n\n\"I feel alive, and the world, I'll turn it inside out, yeah... and floating around in ecstasy\"\nWhat makes you feel more alive than that blow and those strippers? These two catalysts will drive more and more money to invest still more in SPCE, just to get more tendies to fuel their addictions.\n\n\"So dont stop me now dont stop me... Cause I'm having a good time, having a good time.\"\nThe warning to bears, that their negative party killing vibes will not be tolerated.\n\n\"I'm a shooting star, leaping through the sky... like a tiger defying the laws of gravity... I'm a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva... I'm gonna go, go, go... there's no stopping me\"\nThe first of the clear allusions to a spaceship company. Their rockets will leap through the sky like shooting stars, defying the laws of Gravity, racing by at high speed, and you cannot stop this from happening.\n\n\"I'm burning through the sky, yeah... two hundred degrees.. Thats why they call me Mr. Fahrenheit... I'm traveling at the speed of light... I wanna make a supersonic man out of you\"\nGetting even more clear, and prophesying the arrival of hypersonic flight, a goal and what would be a major revenue stream for Virgin Galactic. The outside skin of a spaceship gets very hot at hypersonic speeds, and they want to make a supersonic man out of you. The speed of light reference was just AIDS, sorry.\n\n\n\"Dont stop me now, I'm having such a good time... I'm having a ball... Dont stop me now... If you wanna have a good time just give me a call... Dont stop me now... Dont stop me now... I dont wanna stop at all\"\nMore cocaine and strippers. If you wanna have a good time, give him a call and he'll tell you how to get on the SPCE train.\n\n\"Yeah, I'm a rocketship on the way to Mars... On a collision course... I am a satellite, I'm out of control... I am a sex machine ready to reload... Like an atom bomb about to... Oh, oh, oh, explode\"\n\nThe last line of relavance in the song, before Freddie is forced to resort to choruses and repeats of the same theme in order to ensure this song's popularity, and survival to be of use to us. It cant be more clear. This stock will go to the moon and beyond, but will be high risk once it hits Mars.\n\nNow, I'm sure you're sold on my reasoning now, but wondering why I think this is a prediction of Virgin Galactic and not an IPO of SpaceX or Blue Origin. This is for two reasons. Virgin Galactic is led by SIR Richard Branson. Queens very name was a clue that one of their knights would shower us in tendies. \n\nAs for the message hidden in the date? Virgin Galactic will begin operations this year, 42 years from the year this song was released. 42. The answer to life, the universe, and everything. \n\nTLDR; Buy SPCE, aqcuire tendies in accordance with the prophecy.", "created_utc": 1581810958, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f4i3aw/queen_predicted_virgin_galactic_parabolic_growth/", "is_self": true}
