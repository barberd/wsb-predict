(get in early!)\n\nCurrent: $61.86 (undervalued!) (profit potential++!) (great value!)\n\nPE: 38.45 (lots of upside!) (excellent condition!)\n\n# the love landscape\n\nyou know Match for its Tinder app - the #1 highest grossing non game app on planet earth (unbeatable!), but they also own Plenty of Fish, okcupid, pairs, [match.com](https://match.com), Meetic (EU), [ourtime.com](https://ourtime.com), LoveScout (EU), Hinge, and more. Match absolutely dominates the market whether you're looking to get lucky, get married, or just get rejected!\n\n# pay to win relationships\n\nI know you're thinking that's great and all but **show me the money**, how do they make it? unlike other e-darlings that only make money by convincing advertisers there site is worth something (yeah i'm throwing shade and naming names - $FB, $SNAP, $TWTR, $PINS) $MTCH has **real customers.** the best, most loyal customers in the world, the heartbeat of the global economy and the strongest force on planet earth - **thirsty dudes**. thirsty dudes power the economy. there is nothing easier to make money off of than the male sex drive,. that's why sex is everywhere, they use it to sell beer, to sell cars, to sell concert tickets. it's dependable, reliable, and has an unstoppable, unrelenting demand that MTCH is keenly aware of. **MTCH sells sex DIRECTLY** in a way other companies can only dream of.\n\n# discrete rejection\n\nmatch sells the the dream of love, primarily to guys, but to to girls also. the model is pretty similar to many freemium games - you can play for free, but if you want to find out who is interested in you (impossibly tempting! ) (so enticing!) (how can i resist!) you pay a small fee. if you want to go to the top of results for girls and cut through the clutter, or maybe send a REALLY clear message to that one cutey, match will happily oblige for an affordable price! **You never have to be publicly rejected again** and the cost is actually CHEAPER than going to any bar\n\n# thirsty, clueless dudes\n\nit's the ultimate formula. fear of rejection, fear of approaching, and an unquenchable thirst. much has been said about **female CEO's**. for match **amanda (mandy) ginsburg** is exactly who you want at the helm of this unstoppable match making dynasty. men are for the most part completely unaware or unwilling to accept their own nature, and thus wouldn't be able to turn that primal urge for sex into the maximum profit. mandy has no such limitations and has proven to lead the company to exceptional success. she knows her customers better than they know themselves.\n\n# the lonely generation is the path to unheard levels of wealth and world domination\n\nmillenials are [lonelier than ever](https://socalledmillennial.com/2013/10/02/the-loneliest-generation/). 30% of adults in their 30s and 40s are [lonely](https://preview.abcnews.go.com/Health/american-adults-age-45-lonely-national-survey-finds/story?id=58022317), more people are divorcing than ever before. all of this translates into men and women looking for love in all the wrong places. and $MTCH is there for them, already the leader in america and europe, they are now expanding into asia with [world domination](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/call-traders-swipe-match-stock-182914364.html) as the ultimate goal.

NOPE, **TRY AGAIN.**  you want different genders and orientations? [Tinder has 23 of them](http://freebeacon.com/culture/tinder-now-offers-37-genders-claiming-gender-complex-conversation/).
