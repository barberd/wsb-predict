May this be an adequate offering to the WSB gods.\n\nGraduated as a geologist and currently working as an environmental scientist. A longtime buddy of mine that I worked with recently left to start his own company which focuses on extracting lithium from petrobrine. This is an extremely new idea in general and has the potential to be a revolutionary.\n\nPetroleum brine is an extremely saline solution brought up as a \"waste product\" during petroleum production. It just so happens that lithium naturally occurs in high concentrations in these brines which are VERY ABUNDANT in oil and gas production. \n\nYes, I understand petro is fucked atm but this is a long term play. Lithium is commonly mined by means open pit mining. Petrolithium offers a new way to PASSIVELY GENERATE LITHIUM DURING OIL PRODUCTION from something that is currently classified as a fucking by-product. It could literally be as easy as sticking an apparatus onto every wellhead and flow line and letting it pump tendies. \n\nTLDR; Retarts around the globe will be passively extracting lithium from petrobrines which will most likely take the world by storm in the lithium industry.\n\nEdit: This is for the sole purpose of watching for companies who pop up in this industry. I have no idea which companies are currently doing this or how far along they are. I are tard.
