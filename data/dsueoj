Bet to turn 5k into 15k?", "selftext": "Yo guys...\n\nLong time lurker, first time posting...and the reason why is I'm in big shit and why not turn the situation even better with a couple WSB?\n\nMaking 5k month on salary, but expenses are way over that thanks to 30% tax cut on salary and crazy expense rent in the market.\n\nI have a big bill to be paid in 2 weeks, which is around 10k. I got 5k on my hands, and thinking to go all-in on hopes to go big and save my ass. (just need to triple the $)\n\nWhat would you do in this situation?\n\nThinking to use some leverage to buy stable stocks and sell their call options. You guys with experience at RH, would that work? How much margin can I get with 5k in capital?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's 5 am where I'm right now, and I can't sleep due to financial stress.
