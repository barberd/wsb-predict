{"id": "cz4ppw", "title": "Morning Briefing (9/3/2019)", "selftext": "# Familiar concerns set up market for negative start\n\nThe S&amp;P 500 futures trade 25 points, or 0.9%, below fair value after a long Labor Day weekend in which ongoing global events have contributed to familiar growth concerns.\n\nIn U.S.-China trade news, the 15% tariff rate on $110 billion of new Chinese imports went into effect on Sunday, as did China's retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports. In new developments, China said it has filed a WTO complaint over tariffs, and the two sides are struggling to agree on a date in September for trade talks, according to sources from\u00a0*Bloomberg*.\u00a0\n\nTo be fair, there is nothing to suggest that tensions have further increased or suggest the two sides won't agree on a date. The news, however, does come amid escalated protests in Hong Kong and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's threat to call a general election for Oct. 14 if parliament forces a three-month Brexit delay.\n\nThe latter has contributed to further strength in the U.S. dollar, at the expense of the British pound, which could be a headwind for the earnings prospects of U.S. multinational companies.\u00a0The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.4% to 99.30 -- its highest level since May 2017.\n\nOn the data front, investors will receive the ISM Manufacturing Index for August (Briefing.com consensus 51.3) and Construction Spending for July (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) at 10:00 a.m. ET. Auto and truck sales for August will be released throughout the day.\n\nU.S. Treasuries have edged higher, pushing yields slightly lower this morning. The 2-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.49%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.49%. WTI crude is down 1.8%, or $0.98, to $54.12/bbl.\u00a0\n\nIn U.S. Corporate news:\n\n* **Boeing**\u00a0(BA 359.00, -5.09): -1.4% following a\u00a0*Wall Street Journal*\u00a0report indicating its 737 Max 8 jets could be grounded until next year.\u00a0\n* **Apple**\u00a0(AAPL 206.50, -2.24): -1.1% amid general trade concerns. Apple's AirPods and Apple Watches will no longer be exempt from tariffs.\u00a0\n\nReviewing overnight developments:\n\n* Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region ended Tuesday on a mixed note, with India's Sensex underperforming amid the release of weak growth data.\u00a0Japan's Nikkei UNCH, Hong Kong's Hang Seng -0.4%, China's Shanghai Composite +0.2%, India's Sensex -2.1%, South Korea's Kospi -0.2%, Australia's ASX All Ordinaries -0.1%.\n   * In economic data:\n      * China's August Manufacturing PMI 49.5 (expected 49.7; last 49.7), Non-Manufacturing PMI 53.8 (expected 53.6; last 53.7), and Caixin Manufacturing PMI 50.4 (expected 49.8; last 49.9)\n      * Japan's August Manufacturing PMI 49.3 (expected 49.5; last 49.5)\n      * South Korea's Q2 GDP +1.0% qtr/qtr (last -0.4%); +2.0% yr/yr (last 2.1%).
