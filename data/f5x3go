May not seem like much to you other autists losing $5k and up but it took me all of last month to get those gains in the market.\n\nI'm gonna stick to selling spreads and making smarter choices rather than chase the dragon.\n\nIf we see SPCE hold above 30, then there may be hope, but this is not breaking above 35-40.\n\nIf it breaks above 40 by end of week, I'll drink a cup of my own urine. If I don't you can ban me. I'll be blurring my face tho cuz I can't have that shit ruin my reputation.\n\nWith all that being said I will still make $160 on a SPCE bull put spread at 22/24.\n\nGood luck and godspeed to any retards still holding calls expiring 2/21. We've hit a top on this overvalued stock and if you don't see that then we'll see some major loss porn next week and I expect to see it posted.", "created_utc": 1582053654, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f5x3go/spce_is_out_of_fuel_and_is_heading_back_towards/", "is_self": true}
