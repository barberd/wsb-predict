{"id": "byybj7", "title": "BYND Borrow Rates", "selftext": "I know there have been a lot of posts about BYND. Sorry for making one more! \n\nHere is an update on borrow rates that I have found: Calling around I got 127% (up from 123% on Friday afternoon), but S3 is reporting 134% on existing shorts and 450-700% on new borrows. TLRY peaked at 900%. Apparently 51% of float are still short somehow as of 30 minutes ago...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nS3 also believes that most of this run-up has been long buying, NOT SHORT COVERING. I don't know how accurate that is, but I have no way to verify that. If that is the case, this isn't TLRY 2.0. It means that Tilray was the BYND Beta Test. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut SUPER IMPORTANT: at this point we are definitely close to the endgame. DO NOT put a lot of money in this stock at this point, if any. At some point soon, it will crash hard. I don't know when. It could have already peaked. Please don't lose money trying to cherry pick the top. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck to everyone.", "created_utc": 1560175861, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/byybj7/bynd_borrow_rates/", "is_self": true}
