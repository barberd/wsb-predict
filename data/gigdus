{"id": "gigdus", "title": "Possible bubble in $W, DD inside", "selftext": "Wayfair has gone from $23 in late March to $193 right now.  I looked a bit further at the financials over the last five years here's what I found:\n\n\\- Decent revenue growth (32%/year)\n\n\\- Negative EPS every year.  In fact, EPS has been decreasing every year.  (-0.9, -2.29, -2.81, -5.63, -10.68)\n\n\\- Negative free cash flow every year and it also has been decreasing every year.  \n\n\\- Increasing debt load in the last 3 years.\n\nSo the question is, does the growth of the company justify that it is a money losing business?  I don't think so.  AMZN has a 29% revenue growth over the same period but they are profitable.  This company looks like the next Overstock.  There's no reason it should be at ATHs right now, especially if we believe the economy is opening back up.\n\n150p 8/21.  I picked up some for $17 today, probably holding until I make 50-100% return.", "created_utc": 1589306033.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gigdus/possible_bubble_in_w_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
