{"id": "doduo9", "title": "BYND ER and Lockup Expiration", "selftext": "Keeping this nice and simple:\n\nThey have to smash earnings for this to ride any higher, if not, we will see some major devaluations. \n\nBYND has made a series of deals, but there are no disclosures of whether such deals are profitable. This could be a marketing strategy - low cost to vendors for exposure (wouldn't be too far fetched since this company is just starting to generate some noise). \n\nAnother point to consider is future outlook. Del Taco for one lost money on the BYND deal, this does not set good precedence for future partnerships. \n\nWhat we know is that this company wont be cashflow positive, it has increased competition by larger names (Pizzahut/Kellogs, Tyson, Impossible Burger, etc), and it hasn't come up with anything that is unique or irreplaceable. \n\nFYI: Those burgers tastes like ass. \n\nMy position: 2 puts for November 15th, $105 strike price. 1 put for November 15th $100 strike. 3 puts for Nov 1. 105 strike. 3 puts for November 1. 100 strike.", "created_utc": 1572290906, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/doduo9/bynd_er_and_lockup_expiration/", "is_self": true}
