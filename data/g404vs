{"id": "g404vs", "title": "Oil and storage", "selftext": "Oil prices are dropping due to demand. It\u2019s not the Russia deal that\u2019s effecting it. Public transportation, airlines and general commute transportation have dropped significantly. Most of these energy companies that produce crude oil own rigs that can become damaged if they\u2019re shut down. Therefore these companies will continue to produce oil. But the pipelines are full right? Where can they store all of this  excess oil? Tankers. Tanker companies have already began raising their rates and will experience a high demand for storage. Most of these companies that lease tankers require at least a 6 month payment upon reception of the vessel. This means that even if demand skyrockets, oil companies are still obligated to pay their dues for storage.
