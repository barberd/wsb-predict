{"id": "fbno7x", "title": "RBC Direct Investing - Upset.", "selftext": " Quite upset ... been with RBC DI for a while. In any case, here was my issue and I will try to be brief.\n\nI had 200 Put Option Contracts on SPY 296 expiring February 28th (Yesterday). I put in a sell order with a limit price. The Bids/Asks surpassed this limit price for quite some time, but my order still didn't go through (i.e it said 'Order Pending'). So I cancelled the order, and placed another one, this time an order that was 10% lower than the current bid. Waited 15 minutes, and it still didn't fill. I placed a third order, this time at Market, and it didn't fill. I called RBC DI and waited 1 hour to reach a rep. Once reached, I told him the issue and he asked me to cancel the order and re-place it. He said he saw the order but it would not let him action it. He called a manager who then cancelled my order and sold it on the market immediately. Unfortunately, when I was trying to sell it, it was hovering between 8.5-9.5 USD/Contract. By the time I finally got through to the manager, this number was 6.5-7.5 and the manager closed my position at 6.63. Luckily, I was still in the profit range.\n\nMy question is, has anyone had similar issues? why was I unable to sell the options for hours whilst the manager took 1 minute? Extremely upset and unsure if I want to go with them again. Thinking of switching brokers.\n\nThanks and sorry for rant.", "created_utc": 1583030736, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fbno7x/rbc_direct_investing_upset/", "is_self": true}
