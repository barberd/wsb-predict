Printing money obviously doesn't cure the beer flu, but you know what it does do? Artificially inflate asset prices.\n\n**YOUR PUTS ARE NOT FUCKING SAFE: Puts are bets that the NOMINAL price of stocks will go down, but the REAL value of stocks going down doesn't necessarily mean that their nominal price will go down.**\n\nJP has already started flooding the economy with trillions of dollars. Do you REALLY think Trump is just gonna let him stop, especially in an election year? NO, we are going to have stagflation.\n\nThat doesn't mean you can't make some money on puts in the short run, but it DOES mean that **you need to be careful to not overestimate how far you think the market will fall because inflation will be working against you.**\n\nTo the autists out here who still don't get it, here's a picture with pretty lines to show you what I'm talking about. After Nixon took us off the gold standard in 1971 we went through a period of heavy inflation. Over the next decade, the real value of the DJIA (pretty red line) lost over 60% of its value before it bottomed out in 1982. Meanwhile, the nominal price of the DJIA (pretty blue line) bottomed out in 1974 and quickly recouped its losses. Even though the economy was weak for a decade, puts weren't printing.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/afksv9jp15s41.png?width=538&format=png&auto=webp&s=40493a649a6ce3059e04c3b814ecb6d2d9932ffe", "created_utc": 1586589365.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fyyw1u/jpow_doesnt_need_to_stop_the_economy_from/", "is_self": true}
