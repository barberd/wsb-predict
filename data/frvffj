Mother fucker it might be? No one fucking knows. The OVERALL direction is still bearish, just look at the fucking daily chart. Y\u2019all have gotten to the point where if we don\u2019t hit a circuit halt the market must be bullish all of a sudden. Y\u2019all are really killing my vibe with your all over the place DD. None of you know what is about to happen, because if you actually did you\u2019d be rich enough to not be on this retarded sub. Can we go back to the funny shit and not all this circle jerk none sense? I feel like coming to this sub used to be so entertaining whereas now it just gives me anxiety. Use your own fucking intuition towards your own positions and just keep it to yourself. FUCK. We want loss and gain PORN, not omeagle style fat hairy jerk off sessions.
