The puts gravy train isn\u2019t done yet. The only thing that would make it crash harder is actually having a car to crash lol\n\nHere\u2019s why it will keep dropping sub $1:\n\n- They\u2019re a publicly traded car company that doesn\u2019t even have a car to sell. No way anything is getting pushed to market by 2020. \n\n- Reported $460m in losses with no ready product, and low on cash. \n\n- CANCELLED EARNINGS CALL WTFFFFF ROFL\n\n- Terrible overseas management from China can\u2019t make any decisions and doesn\u2019t know the US customer\n\n- It\u2019s all actually a ruse to grab hype cash from an IPO and transfer IP (re: steal) to Xi Daddy in china\n\n- Nasdaq crackdown on Chinese companies trying to pull a Nio and IPO in the US\n\nTLDR: under $1 by mid December, delisted and/or kaput by mid Jan", "created_utc": 1571841806, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dm0ajb/nio_not_the_one/", "is_self": true}
