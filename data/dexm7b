{"id": "dexm7b", "title": "ATVI &amp; CoD Mobile", "selftext": "Activision just released Call of Duty mobile and already the game is blowing up, but I don\u2019t see analysts talking about it anywhere \u2014 I view this as a positive. By the time Seeking Alpha articles come out, and analysts upgrade the stock, and \u2014 worst of all \u2014 someone posts a \u2018buy\u2019 thread on WSB, the stock will undoubtedly and immediately dip. I get the irony in posting a \u2018buy\u2019 thread in WSB telling you to buy before \u2018buy\u2019 threads are posted in WSB, but my wisdom is great and unmatched, so *bull* with me (cause *bears* are gay).\n\nHere\u2019s the scoop: I work with a bunch of braindead younger guys that spend all day playing video games. The hot game used to be PubG, but everyone has dropped it now for CoD. No one is playing PubG anymore. CoD is still in its early stages, but it\u2019s going to be the next PubG, and they\u2019re going to ramp up its monetization through microtransactions. This hasn\u2019t yet been priced in. The game\u2019s initial download numbers were publicized, but people are still wary whether the game has sticking power (which was a problem with Apex Legends, if you recall). I\u2019m here to tell you that the game DOES have sticking power. If the normies I work with are sinking all their time into the game, it will continue to grow in popularity everywhere. Now, inevitably, something will eventually replace CoD, and it won\u2019t necessarily be another ATVI game, but who gives a fuck? If JD has done anything, it\u2019s showed me that stock-buy-boys only give a fuck about the next quarter or two, and that lesson can be applied to ATVI too.\n\nSo here\u2019s the plan:\n\n-Don\u2019t buy right away as Goldman algos comb WSB to inverse any investing idea\n\n-Buy calls 3-6 months out on the inevitable anti-WSB dip (after one or two weeks)\n\n-Sink your paycheck into buying in-game cosmetics in CoD, causing ATVI to gain more money, thus raising the stock price to go up and causing you to GAIN money, because you gotta spend money to make money, baby\n\nThank you, this has been my MacDonald talk.", "created_utc": 1570527115, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dexm7b/atvi_cod_mobile/", "is_self": true}
