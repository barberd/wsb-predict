{"id": "d8ep9s", "title": "Startups, overvaluation and bubbles", "selftext": "So I work for a startup. its kinda like WSB but with WAAAAAY more Autisim  \n\n\nIts pretty cool. I won't talk about my job because its a bit to specific and all that.   \n\n\nThere are some general things across all startups that people think make them look like they have more value then they do.   \n\n\n**Culture:**\n\nMost startups say this is the most important thing. It's true. Good culture can keep employee's happier at lower costs. \n\nFood  \nWe pay for dinners if anyone is working past 1730 any day of the week. Most people abuse this and get all their work done at the end of the day just for free food. We also have a full kitchen n snacks. People love this. $1000/mo to feed 25 people in my office and give them bull shit sparkling water. **That's the real buy, Fucking sparkling water propped up by venture capital.**\n\nSmash bro's/having a video game outlet/chill room \n\n* $1000 for a TV/Smash/Controllers\n* $200-300 for shitty chairs that make your back hurt\n* Offering it as a Benefit to cut someone $500/mo because we are cool, Priceless\n\nOr, for the real miser out there Ping Pong. \n\n* $250 for a table paddles and balls\n* Pocket the rest from your smash budget into your yearly CEO pay. \n* ????????\n* Take the proceeds and trade options like crazy \n\nMy fav.. by Far.. UNLIMITED VACATION!!!!!!!!!!!(\\*$\\^\\*&amp;$%\\^&amp;%$\n\nSounds cool right? Take as much time off as you want if you meet goals. Hard to take time off when you always have goals... so On avg most of our software/hardware/R&amp;D/other teams I dont work with work 60+ hour weeks and never get time off. I have minimum rest requirements so I get time off cause they don't want the FAA crawling around in their ass.   \n\n\n**Benefits**\n\nMost of the time at a startup you will be in 15-30% below market. But you get shares.. magic worth nothing money that you cant do shit with until a year after IPO without getting fucked right in the ass on price. I got in early and my strike price is single digit.. But we hired some people recently who are like ecstatic that they got in before $20/share. If WeJerkOff is any indication.. the shares are worth bupkiss. I got in early and bought all mine up cause at $0.02 per share.. why the fuck not? not like it can go Tits up right?  \n\n\nRaises  \nThey dont happen unless you clear a funding round or let the CEO use your holes on a regular basis/rim the shit out of them.   \n\n\nHealth Care  \nGood luck getting insurance in a startup that isnt about as useful as a cock flavored lollipop at the white house. one of my co-workers paid for top teir ($400/mo after work pays 60% of it). Broke her leg in 2 places and could not come into work for 6 weeks. She went onto our \"disabled leave\" program and got $400/wk for expenses. The total bill after insurance was $18,000. Shes paid off 25% of it because well... shit insurance and they dont pay shit.   \n\n\nPTO/Sick leave  \nLOL GOOD LUCK. See above. I have watched people get on their knees around holidays to get time off to see fam back home. They always say no, we are short staffed. Well no shit Karen you hired 3 people to do the work of 20. \n\nBenefits related to work training\n\nGood example is my company offers my ability to teach flying up at a discounted rate to people who are keen. The company pays 50% of my fee, employee pays 50% and the plane is paid for by the employee. Its still like $200/hr to learn to fly but people eat this shit up. $35-40 a week to get an employee to be super jazzed about flying and how exciting it is is much better than a $800/mo raise. And it works. They eat it up and think that they will get to my level to teach and join my department cause I tell em being a pilot looks good on their resume. Best part is im pulling $70/hr extra + salary. they fuck me here somehow.. but I still make more than everyone other then the CEO.   \n\n\nWork life Balance  \nLOL good luck. Most of the other teams I work with in my company work 50-70 hrs a week in fear of losing their jobs.   \n\n\n**Valuation**\n\nThe biggest load of shit ever. Every time we have closed a round I see my \"shares\" rise in price. What it really means is the CEO is jerking off a bunch of other people with money to exit 6 months before IPO to sell stocks off at IPO and make a shit load of money. Its Insider trading basically  \n\n\nStrike price  \nDont need to explain this to you autists (i hope). Don't be fooled by 50,000 shares upon signing up. You dont get that shit till 4-5 years in. I was smart and negotiated new grants after every round closing pretty close to my starting strike price so I have like 6-8% of the company now.   \n\n\nBe wary of nothing but good news from leadership  \nTHis means the company is dying.. Look for a job yesterday/dont buy the IPO  \n\n\ninflated valuation  \nThis goes back to a lot of the previous points.. outside investors see all these cool hip kids working to make the world better so they money *Bukakke* all over these companies expecting returns. no matter what they get it, either in IP or app revenue after they gut the company with a takeover. The CEO ONLY has his interests in mind, which are money and jerking off investors for more money.  \n\n\n**Bubbles**\n\nSo.. lets come full circle.   \n\n\nYou have a bunch of poeple working their asses off, under paid and being told their \"shares\" are going to be worth %34573465236458326 of what they got in for and make em rich.   \n\n\nIts a fucking ponzi scheme. Only reason I am around at mine is I work 3 days a week and they value my skill set because its unique to their industry (being the only make tranny hooker in an area is super $$$$$).
