{"id": "grleih", "title": "Your puts suck balls, here's why", "selftext": "You are probably wondering why your puts haven't been printing when there's a full blown recession happening.  Let's start with gamma risk and what it means.\n\nThe market makers buy and sell options, and they MUST hedge their delta and gamma risk-almost by law since they aren't allowed to make any directional bets.  Let's assume that the big dogs at the pension funds are selling covered calls to enhance their profits, and buying puts to protect their long stock.  The options dealers are the ones on the other side of that trade, so we will make a rough assumption that they are mostly long calls and short puts.  You can hedge long calls by shorting the underlying to neutralize your deltas.  But since options have gamma you have to short more if the stock goes up (your call's delta will get bigger and you need to neutralize it).  This flattens the market's up moves and is probably a big reason why SPX didn't close at 3000 yesterday.  Now if the market goes down then the call will have less delta.  Since the MM is short too much stock they will buy some back this (sometimes) makes the market drift up.  Hence, when the market gets to a strike with a bigly amount of call open interest, it tends to stick around that area until those calls expire.  Now compare this with a short put.  If you are short a put then you have positive delta, so you have to short stock to hedge.  However, the more the put goes in the money, the more valuable it becomes.  Hence you have to short even more stock to hedge it.  This creates a waterfall effect that makes down moves even worse if the MM's have a bunch of short puts in their portfolio.  What I've described here is the difference between long and short gamma.  Before the crash in February you could see the Open Interest in puts pile up and know that some shit was going to go down.  Bulls on here were saying BTFD early Feb but the hedgies could see the writing on the wall.  RIGHT NOW THERE IS WAY MORE OI IN CALLS THAN PUTS, SO YOU CAN FORGET ABOUT A CRASH UNTIL THAT CHANGES.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe second reason is that the fed has bought up a bunch of treasury bills during infinite QE and all that inflation has made its way to the market.  Here's a quote from JPMorgan's Dimon,\n\n***\"The Fed's liquidity, bringing out the bazooka, is propping up stock prices (as well as all other asset classes\"***\n\n(source and a good read)\n\n[https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/jpmorgans-dimon-admits-fed-liquidity-propping-stocks](https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/jpmorgans-dimon-admits-fed-liquidity-propping-stocks)\n\nAll down moves are going to have to muscle past historic inflation.\n\nAnother thing to think about is that literally no one gives two shits about the virus.  Did you see all the people partying it up on the Memorial day holiday?  There is a lack of supply right now but not demand.  This means there is a good chance a chunk, but not all, of the economic damage can be repaired .\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are a lot of solid reasons to be bearish for the mid or long term, but please think about the factors that are influencing the up moves instead of brushing them off and going all in on some bullshit 5 delta put that expires in a week every time the S&P drops 1.4%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPositions for those that didn't read:  180 $spy put, expiry right fucking now.", "created_utc": 1590592038.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/grleih/your_puts_suck_balls_heres_why/", "is_self": true}
