I was down 30k most of friday until the end where TSLA pumped and I sold 30k worth for like 1k profit held the rest. And then I woke up this morning and sold on the pump. Idc if that shit goes to 1000 by earnings i\u2019m taking my profits and running. \n\nHere\u2019s my overall for the memes\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/g4MU6yQ\n\ntook out 150k already and taking out the rest over the next 2 weeks.
