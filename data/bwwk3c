The Implied Volatility is '--', which is also really strange.   Am I getting IV crushed?  I don't think so, because I've held onto this option since Apr 3, and it doesn't expire until Jul 19. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny opinions on what to do with this option?  Sell at open?  Let it ride until expiration?  I was originally going to sell it before earnings, but I let it ride because I really didn't much money into it.", "created_utc": 1559696142, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bwwk3c/questions_about_my_gme_put_is_rh_bugged/", "is_self": true}
