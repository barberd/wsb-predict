{"id": "g37o4c", "title": "Oil Trading at 70 year lows, and could go below $0", "selftext": "Inflation adjusted, oil is trading at [70 year lows](https://imgur.com/a/g7krsle) right now.\n\nThis is lower than it was during Peak US Oil, and FAR lower than it was after 9/11 or during the GFC. Even with OPEC+ production cuts, we continue to be at the lowest prices since the 1950s. \n\nIn and of itself, this is quite telling of the present global economic prospects. No one is traveling, no one is producing, no one is consuming. Things are bad.\n\nDespite how low oil is right now, though, it has room to go FAR lower. The processes of extracting oil are time-consuming, technically challenging, and quite expensive to start up. Canadian tar sands, for example, involve pumping steam underground to soften the crude (bitumen, technically), after which it is mined and refined. Other processes (mainly at refineries) can take weeks to months to start back up after the engineering and supply chain issues are taken into consideration. \n\nBecause of the challenges of restarting the extraction and refining processes, producers will continue to extract oil and store it for future sale. \n\nStorage capacity is limited, though, and once capacity is met, purchasing oil from a manufacturer becomes a **service transaction** instead of a purchase of a good. Manufacturers may have to literally pay a person to take it off their hands. \n\nThe bottom of this is **NOT** $0. The bottom of this is the costs of whatever it will take to restart the production process. \n\nOil could absolutely go negative.\n\n[Link to historic WTI charts](https://www.macrotrends.net/1369/crude-oil-price-history-chart) for those interested.", "created_utc": 1587148326.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g37o4c/oil_trading_at_70_year_lows_and_could_go_below_0/", "is_self": true}
