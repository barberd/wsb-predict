{"id": "czckvr", "title": "Free earnings tends: Cloudera ($CLDR) -- DD Inside", "selftext": "**About the stock:**\n\nCloudera specializes in creating solutions for companies to manage large amounts of data and apply machine learning models to said data. TL/DR: Software made for retarded business analysts who have no clue wtf data science is or how it works but know how to click buttons on a computer.\n\n**Valuation:**\n\nSince IPO in 2017 (at $18) the stock has ranged between $23 and $5 and is now sitting at a fairly attractive price of $7.20 ($1.97B cap). Growth slowed down and investors fled after a shitty merger with Hortonworks, but they've since been trying to turn the company around. Last quarter they posted revenue of $187M which represented an 81% y/y growth. For the retards in the back, this means they posted close to the revenue of $ROKU last quarter ($250M) at an even better growth rate (81% vs. 59%) for 1/9 the valuation. \n\nLooking at forward revenue, they guided for $180-183M for this upcoming quarterly earnings; I'm hoping for a solid beat of around $190M. So if we extrapolate a bit, they could see 4-quarter forward revenue (assuming steady growth) of close to $1 billion, which would translate to \\~2 P/S -- when compared to other software stocks that's peanuts.\n\n**Catalysts:**\n\nThey recently announced a new platform called Cloudera Data Platform (CDP for short) which aims to take their entire business to the cloud and operate solely on subscriptions, as opposed to the in-person custom solutions they provide now. This \\*should\\* accelerate growth even more and bring in those juicy subscription based revenues that every wall st. analyst gets off to.\n\n**Some other things:**\n\nCarl Icahn, activist investor who bought into $NFLX at $10, recently became involved with the company this summer; he bought up 20% of the shares and installed 2 of his henchmen to the board of Cloudera. This man means business and he won't take losses for an answer, even if it means calling up Trump and having him pump the damn thing on twitter.\n\n**Acquisition:**\n\nIn June, Cloudera and IBM announced a \"strategic partnership\". This comes after IBM had a juicy relationship with Hortonworks, the company that Cloudera merged with. IBM would be a top contender for buying out $CLDR at a fat premium -- they just acquired RedHat for like $30 billion so $2-3 billion would be nothing to them. I've read that Icahn has been encouraging a buyout as well, and I'd guess Cloudera would go for at $12-15/share.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Final thoughts:**\n\nOptions are still pretty cheap -- there's about a 14% implied move but the stock has seen huge 40% moves after earnings. At a $2B valuation, this seems like a no-brainer. Loaded up on 9/20 $7.50 calls today, and earnings are AH on 9/4.\n\nGood luck!", "created_utc": 1567552804, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/czckvr/free_earnings_tends_cloudera_cldr_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
