Analyst are saying that this recession could cost the airline industry 100B and the fed is wishy washily mulling over only offering 50B to bail these companies out. If a company is strapped for cash and gets offered half of what they need do you really think this is going to prevent companies that haven't prepared for this disaster from going bankrupt? It doesn't matter if airlines get bailed out, AAL is for sure going bankrupt,  they have zero cash reserve and cannot possibly handle the lower revenue for a month let alone the next 4-6 months due to quarantine. And even after that, we are looking at a full on recession which will continue to lower peoples want to fly as less people will be spending money on travel. ALSO, imagine how many companies are going to change their operating practices to significantly lower costs by permanently reducing air travel, hotel stays, and even closing physical offices after being forced to implement work from home packages and then realizing 6 months from now that working from home is amazing at reducing costs, has little effect on productivity, and is just basically the future and they have been stuck in the goddamn stone age on this.  A bailout of AAL will go straight into the executives' pockets as they all jump ship, declare bankruptcy and then get bought for assets by a competitor in a better position that they are.
