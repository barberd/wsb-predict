The stock market crashes an additional 80% lower from these levels.\n\nWhat should a normal investor be invested in before that happens to protect oneself, or perhaps even benefit (make a few or a lot of bucks) during a crash?  Is it a short or put play?\n\nAppreciate your thoughts as this is an angle and strategy I have never used.
