And thought maybe these highs, are in fact our new lows.  If QE inflates asset prices, should we re-think what the benchmark of each low is?\n\nThe US economy is 21 trillion and the economic stimulus is just under 20% of that. \n\n* US Economy: 21,439\n* Stimulus: 4,000\n* Stimulus as a Percentage of GDP: 18.66%\n\nUsing SPY as an example, $220 was the low. So if we multiply the low of each stock by 18.66% we see where prices should be at based on no changes to the economy, except for a pile of money dropping in from nowhere. This puts the SPY $220 low priced at $261.05.
