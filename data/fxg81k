Don't fight the fed.", "selftext": "Great episode explaining how exactly Fed's QE worka. This round of QE is nothing like 2008. The guest on the show, Kevin Muir, said that what they were printing in a week in 2008, they're printing in a DAY. He also pointed out that the fed will never run out of money, because of course, and also that they will \"do what it takes.\" He said even the Swiss central bank is buying SP500. Said he wouldn't be surprised if fed starts directly purchasing equities. He explains how fed is purchasing gobs of corporate debt. Then he said something very alarming in the episode. He said he wasn't worried about whether this round of QE would stabilize credit markets or not. He said his real worry was that it would set market's \"on fire.\" As in, to the moon. We all know that's what gains since 2008 were all about. I think we're going to have a little volatility in the short term. I wonder how Q1 corporate earnings this summer will affect equities markets. But none of it matters. There's no point selling my puts now because they're worthless. Someone tell me why Kevin Muir is wrong and why I shouldn't go long.\n\nEDIT: Here is the episode:\n\nEpisode 192, \"Whatever it Takes\"\n\nhttps://chatwithtraders.com/ep-192-kevin-muir-the-macro-tourist/", "created_utc": 1586384437.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxg81k/r_u_considering_changing_your_mind_latest_episode/", "is_self": true}
