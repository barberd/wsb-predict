It doesn\u2019t get easier then this boys:\n\nYou see CL20 may future closing at -36? What do you think that means? A lot of traders are drowning in oil, which will be delivered. So they need to offload it ASAP. All this will go into June. Also the whole world is in lockdown. There is absolutely no demand. Do you really think it can go to 30 or higher? Offcourse not. Only way is down..\n\nInstead of looking for some rain man type option play you retards are missing the easiest trade of the century..", "created_utc": 1587503733.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5nvol/again_sell_the_june_crude_oil_future_you_morons/", "is_self": true}
