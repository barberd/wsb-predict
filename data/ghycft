Here's ANOTHER solid DD for you guys: EVRI", "selftext": "Full Disclosure: I've submitted the following DD at 1pm ET today but it was deleted by moderators for some reason... Anyways, if you had bought EVRI calls at the time of this post, you would have been up 70% by now. Casino stocks, and supporting industries like EVRI are going to skyrocket soon with reopenings and the recently announced Eldorado & CZR merger. So listen do this one carefully:   \n\n\nI've been following EVRI for a while now, and I'm starting to seeing some upward trend on this oversold casino technology stock... To begin with, Everi Technologies is the only provider of gaming technology (i.e., slot machines, casino ATMs etc.) with no real competitors. What's interesting with EVRI is that it took an unjustified beat when casinos shut down in March. The company was trading at $14 a share and now its hovering around a $4.80 (!) which is a whopping 34% of pre-COVID value. But here's more:\n\n* 80% of revenue comes from maintenance and operations. In other words, EVRI doesn't depend on new slot machine sales. Casinos will still need EVRI to maintain their existing machines which reduces the risk of a revenue downturn in the short run\n* Casinos are opening end of this month. Wynn and Ceasars are set to open on May 15. The news will put the spotlight on casino stocks, and ultimately on EVRI. This might even result in a sharp spike in the coming weeks\n* EVRI takes a percentage cut on casino withdrawals. So yes, there will be less gamblers on the floor but if the spend increases that might still compensate for the demand\n* Company had solid guidance going into 2020. The revenues increased 14% YoY. Earnings will be released on June 26 which will be an exciting run for bulls\n\nAll in all, I think EVRI is something worthwhile considering. 5c and 7.5c 6/19 call options are trading at $0.80 and $0.15 per contract at the moment. Once EVRI breaks through the $5 threshold, these options will see significant volume and potentially 2-3x return.\n\nYou're welcome dickheads.", "created_utc": 1589237240.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghycft/ok_heres_another_solid_dd_for_you_guys_evri/", "is_self": true}
