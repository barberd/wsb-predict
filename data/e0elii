Figure out a bunch of crazy solutions to make you super rich and successful? Mabye thats what he has been doing all along, and bringing Neural Link public, a dumbed down version for the masses is the best way to blend in.  Mabye this is how he gets so much done, he plugs in every night and runs every scenario and comes up with new ideas all the time.
