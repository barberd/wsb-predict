You think there won't be a shift to remote work or more interconnected work after this? Newsflash! You are a fucking retarded boomer.\n\nInformation security stocks are already undervalued as fuck and its a rapidly growing industry. If my dumbass makes 130k  a year in LCOL then you know this shit is something to look at.\n\nThese are the top players in the industry and anyone that isn't braindead will tell you the same. You think Blackberry's shitty ass EDR Cylance is relevant in 20 fucking 20? Get fucked by GRU. You think anyone besides Proofpoint has the threat Intel required to stop 1,000,000 virus ridden emails from China a day? Get fucked by Poo. You think Qualys or Rapid7 can compete vs Tenable? I have 10 Rapid7 sales people call me every goddamn day for a demo. Get fucked.\n\nTenable - Best vuln scanning software in the market\n\nCrowdstrike - Best EDR (antivirus basically for you retards out there)\n\nProofpoint - Best email protection (if you don't have this your company info is being reviewed by Chang Chong Poo Bear daily)\n\nDon't be retarded. Invest in the fasted growing industry while you're still young.
