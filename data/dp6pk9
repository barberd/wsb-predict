Look at the financials, they have heavily invested and cash flows are growing. On top of that, they have a very low debt to equity ratio, which means interest rate hikes won't affect them as much and their overal expenses stay low.\n\nSSYS does 3d printing in construction, they are my favourite of the two, they have great innovation and they got the business right all along.\n\nThey are releasing their earnings on the 13th of november.\n\nThese are my trades: \n\n7 $SSYS Call 15 Nov 23.00USD for 0.40USD each\n\n5 $SSYS Call 15 Jan 2021 30.00USD For 2.00USD each\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you guys think?", "created_utc": 1572441948, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dp6pk9/3d_printing_technology_on_the_verge_of_being/", "is_self": true}
