DXJ has rallied pretty strongly lately.  If you are looking for the next country to rally, look at China with the FXI etf.  I'm no fan of commie governments, but the absolute negativity surrounding Chinese stocks due to the trade war and the HK stuff has reached a plateau and can only get better.  On the otherhand, Chinese have been stockpiling up on gold bigtime during the trade war.  I heard there were significant premiums for physical gold in China.  This obviously means folks there were selling stuff like real estate and stocks to buy gold as a way to get out from under the thumb of the CCP.  This is a massive lopsided sentiment that is corroborated by the COT reports which reflect massive short interest by the big banks in gold and silver.  Is it high risk?  I don't think so.  FXI long, short gold.  This trade should bear fruit for a few months.  After that, things could change.", "created_utc": 1571305164, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dj401d/china_stocks_are_ready_to_rally_gold_is_ready_to/", "is_self": true}
