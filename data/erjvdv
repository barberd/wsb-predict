I found dae way", "selftext": "Ok you autists, I found the real way to avoid taxes and its easier than ever before:\n\n1. Take all of your tendies &amp; gains and buy BTC with the same brokerage account\n2. Transfer the btc you bought into your wallet\n3. Send it to a couple more wallets of your own / friends, back and forth and back and forth, preferably to wallets that don't have KYC shit\n4. After some good ol' blockchain money laundering from one public key to another sell the BTC at a different exchange, at the price you bought it for, hence no gain to pay taxes on\n5. Get rich and send some fucking chicken tenders to my basement and buy a tesla so we can get even richer on these TSLA calls\n\nLITERALLY can't go tits up", "created_utc": 1579555156, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/erjvdv/forget_detroit_fuck_the_bermudas_or_any_other_tax/", "is_self": true}
