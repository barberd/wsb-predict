I bought the 1950x and the 2990wx when they released, and the products alone pay for themselves for the workloads that I do. \n\nI think there's a 50/50 chance AMD is gonna go up in the next week or two. Just look at that MACD, shits about to cross over and rain down profits. Plus Christy Mac was great, and they both share three letters, so what more could you ask for.\n\nIf you need more proof: My play is a measly 8 x Feb 6th $60c because Feb is the 3rd month...  2 x 3rd month = 6 And the 6th day + $60 calls + 2x3rd month = 666.\nThis correlates with the fact that we're all here to make money; the fact that most people here would sell their souls for money means that we'll all have good luck with 666.\n\nI rest my case and God speed.", "created_utc": 1581412705, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f25y0w/amd_satan_conspiracy_profits/", "is_self": true}
