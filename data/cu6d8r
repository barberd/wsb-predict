As I lurked some more, I decided to download robinhood and give it a whirl casually investing with spare change, since I have a 401k..I have a concept of stocks etc...\n\nSo anyway, my first trade: I was expecting radeon VII from AMD, when released back on march 7th - to be revolutionary and blow up stocks etc.\n\nI didn't have a lot of money, so i just bought 3 shares at 19. Didn't even realized earnings happened and then sold it for 20% profit a few days later. I had no idea what options were yet.\n\nThen I realized how much more money i would have made with that mere 80 bucks if it were an FD as opposed to a stock share or two.  After blowing a few hundred on poorly chosen FD's, I regrouped and made my big move on the date of the FED announcement  (same day biogen shit the bed and was down like 20%) I had kept averaging down a bunch of aapl, xbi and spy call FD's from the night before...then after the FED talk BOOM, they explode into 1000% etc.\n\nThen i learned about PTD restriction and was unable to sell (see the large peek and then immediate drop https://imgur.com/a/SegBjHo)\n\nThen further down that graph I just bled out bag-holding boeing for a month or something because some guy on here said to mortgage your house etc. go nuts buy boeing until you're broke etc...sigh. shouldn't have.\n\nbut here's how I ended up today\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/g1tBEx3\n\nhaving a few bourbons now. just wanted to say cheers and thanks for the laughs.\n\n(and after that first fuck up with boeing and day trading, i'm not making progress last 3 months\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/QRVWYJB)\n\nthanks for reading, fags.", "created_utc": 1566520693, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cu6d8r/hey_guys_just_wanted_to_say_thanks_for_a_fun_6/", "is_self": true}
