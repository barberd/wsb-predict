If you'r like me, you'r overwrought with envy and cringing as you scroll through wsb ogling someone else's gains porn. Don't be hard on yourself, you can't help it but watch with disgust as the tendies that could have been yours are had by every chad and brad on here. It's not too late though, you never knew the fundamentals on TSLA before, why would they matter now?  Stop being the envious piece of shit day trading in their mother's basement who gets left in the dust while we all get rich, and go buy some TSLA calls!
