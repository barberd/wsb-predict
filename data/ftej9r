{"id": "ftej9r", "title": "Auto Erotic Asphyxiation", "selftext": "I did my best to stay away from this god forsaken sub, but the tantalizing gains that made it to r/all seduced me like so many other naive boys my age. I fought the primal urges that welled deep inside me. I told myself I would simply do the five finger shuffle that one time - but it happened again and again and again. I was already hooked but deep in delusion and denial. I did mental gymnastics to convince myself it was just a normal and healthy interest in stocks. I joined and left and joined again. I hated myself and knew I was playing a dangerous game. Things were ramping up.  \n\nSlowly but surely things began to change. I was doing the five finger shuffle to loss porn and even chucking at vulgar posts about cuckholds and the mentally ill. Then one day in a sticky spiral of self loathing and pleasure - I downloaded the app. Congratulations you have a free stock! GRPN. Ahhh fuck yeah it's free money!!!\n\nThat was a month ago and somehow I'm up a grand and I have tugged my slug so many times it's basically my resting state. But as these things go ITS NEVER ENOUGH. Now while obsessively checking the price of SPY options I have come across this depraved act know as a \"strangle\". Sweet baby belfort some help me! As we speak a neck tie is around my neck and attached to the door knob of my room in my parents house. Another knob is about to come into play. I write this post as one last cry for help before I enable my RH margin and drop to my knees. \n\nPosition: SPY \"strangle\" 12/31 max cost. 4329.\n\nPlease help me. Why shouldn't I do this?", "created_utc": 1585796002.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ftej9r/auto_erotic_asphyxiation/", "is_self": true}
