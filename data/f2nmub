Previously he\u2019d been telling me that it keeps going down and asked my advice what to do? I didn\u2019t really think about it too much and told he well if you think that the fundamentals haven\u2019t changed you can always average down your cost basis. I thought he only had like 30k in it so I wasn\u2019t too concerned cause that\u2019s just chump change for him. He apparently took that as throw mf tendies at it cause it can\u2019t go tits up. I was trying to explain to him that oil might not be the best sector and has past its glory days, but he said nah oil too the Mooon! Fidelity asked him why he has his whole portfolio in one stock and asked to manage his money. He said fuck that no one touches my tendies you tiny ball cucks.\n\nTLDR: I come from a stock of big ball autistic traders.
