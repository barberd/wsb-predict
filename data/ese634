Are they trying to keep all the gains for themselves???\n\n$SNAP diligence:\n- I know peeps who work there and they are hiring from all the other FANG companies handing out stock like hot cakes\n- They haven't even tapped advertising revenue potential yet; FB users are worth like $158 while SNAP users are worth like $15. This is a big goal for Snap this year.\n- Evan Spiegel rhymes with Seven Eagles (aka seven times more American than Zuckerberg which rhymes with Fucking Nerd)\n- A kidnapped 14 year old used $SNAP to escape which will make parents who dont get what snap is really used for tell their kids to use it thereby increasing DaUs\n- Earnings is Feb 7th (lucky date for Seven Eagles) and they will probably be profitable shooting them to Tesla-like gains", "created_utc": 1579709665, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ese634/the_mods_dont_want_you_to_know_5_days_ago_i/", "is_self": true}
