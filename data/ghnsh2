The two earnings report days Dollar General was red but the next few days after continued its upwards trend as it absorbs the minor failures.\n\no  The two dates it missed its earnings are: 12/01/2016 and 03/14/2019\n\no  8/30/2019 the day after earnings day Dollar General +/- by $27.88 in a day closing green near its day highs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m6nnl4r5k5y41.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=62aa8922985a2e8263e87acb322e94ae09dd0dd2\n\no  03/21/2020 earnings day Dollar General +/- by $42.44 in a day closing green near its day highs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z2v0qo57k5y41.png?width=834&format=png&auto=webp&s=e94552fcda23f1af5da97a825221066925090f8c\n\n\u00b7  MACD is trending upwards with signal lines indicating it will cross and it has a positive configuration at roughly 16.69-.18.33.\n\n\u00b7  Majority of analysts have a strong buy for short- and long-term forecasts\n\n\u00b7  Dollar General announced they will hire 50,000 more employees during the Corona Virus era to keep up with booming demand.\n\n\u00b7  Overall total volume of the options contracts is currently 3,284 as of this post. The Puts to call ratio: 1.3:1. However open interest has a call ratio of 1.02:1 signaling early entry position to ride the call train as Dollar General only increases over time and is deemed recession proof.\n\n\u00b7  Dollar General has profit margins greater than Walmart and Costco and by operating with fewer employees, overhead and selling brand named products at a cheaper rate in low income communities has helped stabilize the impacts of corona deeming it corona proof.\n\n\u00b7  DG entered an Uptrend as Momentum indicator exceeded the 0 level on May 8, 2020. Odds for DG making money is very high.\n\n\u00b7  Dollar General is a store that consists of cheaper goods than Walmart and Costco. In times of recessions or depressions, I predict the go to store will be Dollar General due to the majority of Americans being middle class to lower class with the majority of American having not even 2 months savings expenses in their accounts.\n\n\u00b7  How Does Dollar General Compare to top competitors? There isn\u2019t even an equity summary score for how much DG is going to rise. Look at the price performance in 52 weeks. 2nd to target and no one else even coming close. PE ratio can be used to evaluate future earnings predictions and market cap. Does not count other factors and the P/E ratio is 2nd to Walmart. Dollar General is an under the radar option/stock play. With a Beta of .53, Market movements doesn\u2019t effect it that much due to the fact this Dollar General is Corona proof.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4zjb54t9k5y41.png?width=822&format=png&auto=webp&s=6149b63e2e5f4542442f8b6847a1fda25270b7ab\n\nDollar General is not also worried about supply chain issues per CEO of Dollar General:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mw93mslck5y41.png?width=782&format=png&auto=webp&s=85739432e4a87089b1a608ca6f7e072d70e8483f\n\nSome Key Stats About $DG and its industry valuation:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2ftgrd5ek5y41.png?width=810&format=png&auto=webp&s=52a87d471f5369bd8a8bc893cfb57a5d783276d0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReasons Skeptics say not to buy:\n\n\u00b7  \u201cits at all time highs\u201d\n\n\u00b7  \u201cits overbought RSI is at 82\u201d\n\n\u00b7  \u201cWhat's Dollar General?\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s some links and TA:\n\nThe DG Uptrend Momentum Indicator: [https://twitter.com/Tickeron/status/1259071349223378945](https://twitter.com/Tickeron/status/1259071349223378945)\n\nDollar General Margin Vs Walmart and Costco Margin\n\n[https://twitter.com/MazwoodCap/status/1258848619022647303](https://twitter.com/MazwoodCap/status/1258848619022647303)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pjmul2gfk5y41.png?width=804&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fd39f2189b306228f4aea9760a89bb0c44caeb5\n\nTLDR: $DG is the new Walmart, the new Target craze from 2019 has shifted to the Dollar General Spaceship of 2020.
