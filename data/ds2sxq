{"id": "ds2sxq", "title": "Choosing a Personal Risk Tolerance That Works For You", "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nDisciple of u/Controlthenarrative here and today I'd like to talk about one of the most important aspects of leveraging your hard earned dollars. That is, yes, your personal risk tolerance. Evidently everyone has their own, showcased by multiple autists that have utilized Robinhood's newly implemented infinite money process. In this post I will briefly list the steps necessary to choose a PRT that works for you! \n\nStep 1: Find a yacht that you'd like to own. This first step is pretty simple - with your newfound wealth, you're going to want a yacht that suits you and your boating needs. Find the price of that yacht. This sum plus any other future major expenses you can think of should be included in your PRT. \n\nStep 2: Leverage your money until you reach this amount! By this point I'm assuming most of you understand the infinite money process, so I won't go in depth here. Simply leverage until you have equity that is at least half the price of the yacht you've chosen plus other expenses you expect to incur at the top 1%. \n\nStep 3: Buy as many AAPL put FD's you can afford. This step is probably the most important. While leveraged (to the tits of course), you're going to want to buy something that is guaranteed to rake in 500-1000% returns, MINIMUM. In case you guys haven't been paying attention, Apple has been showing a lot of weakness (only up around 32% in the past 3 months), so this play should almost be illegal considering how free the money is. You're going to want to buy the closest expiration possible, and at least 5% OTM (preferably more, higher profit!).\n\nStep 4: Profit. \n\nStep 5: Buy your yacht, enjoy! \n\nWell, there it is, WSB. Five simple steps for finding and choosing a personal risk tolerance that works for you and your personal financial goals! Hopefully you all take advantage of Robinhood's free money feature and use it to achieve your wildest dreams. Thank you for your time, and remember... \n\nGUH", "created_utc": 1572976423, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ds2sxq/choosing_a_personal_risk_tolerance_that_works_for/", "is_self": true}
