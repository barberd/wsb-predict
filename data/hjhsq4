I started making more conscientious decisions, less YOLOs and just overall better trades. I told myself I will find love if the next trade goes my way, that the profit is for my future love, not for me. I call it the LOVE strategy, but can't find the right words to make it into an acronym.", "created_utc": 1593633576.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hjhsq4/trading_using_love/", "is_self": true}
