LYFT +6.41% expects to be profitable on an adjusted earnings basis, before factoring in costs such as interest, taxes and depreciation, a year ahead of analysts\u2019 expectations, the company\u2019s co-founders said Tuesday.\n\nThe projection for profitability by the end of 2021 is Lyft\u2019s first public commitment regarding its timeline on the matter. Lyft and larger rival Uber Technologies Inc. have been under pressure from investors to show a path to profitable growth.\n\nThe companies, which both went public this earlier this year, set records for the largest losses for a U.S. startup in the 12 months before their initial public offerings.\n\nLyft in August projected 2019 revenue to be $3.47 billion to $3.50 billion, compared with a previous range of $3.28 billion to $3.30 billion. The company said it expects an EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, loss of $850 million to $875 million in 2019.\n\nLyft shares were up about 10% Tuesday to more than $45 apiece after the projection was made publicly at the WSJ Tech Live conference here. That is still a steep decline from the company\u2019s share price of $72 in March and below its last private financing round of $47 a share.\n\nUber\u2019s shares jumped about 6% to about $33 apiece, below the company\u2019s $45 initial-public-offering price.\n\nLyft CEO Logan Green said public market sentiment had turned against companies that are spending heavily in pursuit of high growth.\n\n\u201cI think the market as a whole has changed,\u201d Mr. Green said. \u201cThere has been a major shift from investors valuing growth to going to value stocks. That shift has had very broad implications that have impacted us.\u201d\n\nHelping to stem Lyft\u2019s losses is a reduction in coupons and incentives, on which both Uber and Lyft relied heavily to attract riders and drivers in their yearslong battle for U.S. market share. Both had kept prices artificially low.\n\nLyft President John Zimmer said that the company is handing out fewer coupons and that prices for rides are normalizing.\n\n\u201cYou can call that higher prices,\u201d Mr. Zimmer said. But he added that discounts to build up scale \u201care not necessary in today\u2019s world.\u201d\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/lyft-expects-to-be-profitable-a-year-earlier-than-projected-11571765364?mod=pls\\_whats\\_news\\_us\\_business\\_f](https://www.wsj.com/articles/lyft-expects-to-be-profitable-a-year-earlier-than-projected-11571765364?mod=pls_whats_news_us_business_f)", "created_utc": 1571770211, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dlmfdt/lyft_expects_to_be_profitable_a_year_earlier_than/", "is_self": true}
