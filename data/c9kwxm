But then the next day it rose about 50%, but my money was still lower than it was before? How do I lose 50%, then gain 50% and still be down overall. I thought this was commission free trading? Idk if this is a scam or what. I have a strongly worded email typed up and ready to send to RH corporate about this issue. Just wanted to know if others were dealing with the same, thanks.", "created_utc": 1562359143, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c9kwxm/i_think_robinhood_is_stealing_from_me/", "is_self": true}
