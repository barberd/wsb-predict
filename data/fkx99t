{"id": "fkx99t", "title": "The greatest exodus to cash ever would be a leading indicator to a complete washout soon imo.", "selftext": "Gold, silver, copper, almost all metals, oil, bonds and equities are allllll down. \n\nPeople wonder why this is and it\u2019s simple bc whoever is selling wants cash and that is because cash is just that. Cash, it\u2019s not going to go up or down, just sit there until it\u2019s time to put it to work again. \n\nPrice actions today, and on a Wednesday seemed wild in the wildest times. I mean I\u2019d look at the ten year and it was up so I\u2019d be like \u201cmotherfucking fed you fuckers!!\u201d Then look at my puts and I was up nice. On a side note I bought vxx calls yesterday, 3 for 800 each and sold them at open, around 2 they were worth 1700 EACH!! I managed to come away with 3GS today was 4500 at the lows but I won today and that\u2019s how you look at it. \n\nYeah sooo gold was down huge and oil was like ridiculous, so low I never imagined. I thought maybe we get under 20$ bc of everything but not this fast. Not only gold though but other metals, which kinda should be expected bc of the sudden lack of demand then you combine that with speculators and no one wants near the stuff and who can blame them. Gld and slv 4/17 puts?? \n\nAn exodus to cash like nothing seen before means more falling prices and I know a lot of people say it will come back fast and while I am not so sure about that bc I lived through 2008-09 then 2011, all that cash on the sidelines kinda points to some big spikes on the way back up. A bond bubble bursting would be incredible and terrible for equities if the ten year goes to theee or four people won\u2019t want to buy houses all of a sudden bc of much higher interest rates combined with less money covid19  will cause. Equities will loose out when the ten years yield doubles the average dividend of the snp a lot of people will pile into that. \n\nAll that and terrible jobs data, earnings and gdp is coming so it will be wild for a time to come. \n\nSpy 5/15 p 220.
