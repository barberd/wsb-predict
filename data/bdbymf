That being said -- I got kind of fucked on my own positions by posting the exact trades I planned on taking. Contrary to popular belief, the strikes weren't removed because I was worried about liability, but because my personal entries got inflated, and one of the trades returned 35% that should have returned 90% or more. Unfortunately, I'm not listing my exact strikes or dates because they shouldn't even be pertinent to you. The strikes I pick are based on if I hold long shares in any of the companies, but as well based on my liquidity, risk tolerance, and my personal allocation per play. You should learn that stuff on your own, to be frank.\n\n# How I Pick Plays For Myself\n\nThese plays are found using my own scanner criteria across a variety of metrics depending on market conditions. Picks are generated from that scan. Those scans are ran through scripts that check certain volatility skews. These are my own scripts, and I won't divulge much more than that about it. The indicative theory here is sell IV when it's high and buy IV when it's low, follow trends and follow the big money (I rarely list my credit spread plays, because I don't want someone to blow their retirement out of the water based on my advice). Volatility is literally the most important aspect in options pricing and finding positive EV situations. A few of the criteria for the ToS scans are:\n\n* Market cap of $5B+\n* Daily volume of 1M+\n* Volume, volume differential, RSI, 52 week low's and high's, ToS sizzle, and a few others decide what comes out of the scan, then selected as a pick based on script results/current market conditions/sentiment.\n\n# My Project Update\n\nI have some things in the works. I'm still working on the small account challenge, and some other things. I don't really like, nor use Twitter, but I may start one so you can get updates on it elsewhere, we'll see. I have a couple other things in the pipeline, so if you want to know more about them, feel free to message me. I don't want to make this post about my ventures outside of here. Let's get to fucking betting bois.\n\n# Results On Last Week's Picks\n\n**Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY) -** ***BEARISH*** \\- Company is shit, just like I thought. They beat earnings but as I said last week, I had both FD's and May/Junes. The May/Junes I'm bagholding like Michael Burry because I just don't believe in it. They beat EPS estimates but as some of you saw me post, the company is just flat out shit. The things I already knew came to light, their balance sheet is wacked and they're predicting low single digit long term growth (IE: inflation anybody?). I'll probably sell them and roll them in the upcoming days because I really think this stocks going to pull a JCPenny, hopefully before July. The short float's still insane, so it may Roku out and rebound, we'll see.\n\n**Delta Airline (DAL) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Definitely beat earnings like I thought they would, they're not exposed to the Boeing stuff, and unfortunately, they couldn't hold the big gains and we saw some profit taking from shareholders. After consolidation, I would assume they continue to rise, so I have May contracts still -- and I plan on watching and deciding what to do here. I sold some of them right at open for 50%.\n\n**Twitter (TWTR) -** ***BULLISH***  \\- Twitter had high points and low points, the market was really a sideways clusterfuck all week except for some segments, but I found a couple good entries and made a couple profitable trades on it still. Had two go completely to zero, though.\n\n**Boeing (BA) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- They already started their claw back to 400+. Enough said here, I don't think it's surprising, at all. If it wasn't for Boeing's drop, Dow would be at all time highs nearly.\n\n**Snap (SNAP) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Well, those people still holding puts from months ago probably hate this stock more than ever. Until it hits 17, I don't see it slowing down. It pulled back pretty hard after it rose, and it may still, but I wouldn't try to time its pullbacks.\n\n**Macy's (M) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Yo fuck this stock for real. I made a pile on it a week or so ago when it crested 26, and I really thought it was done with this gain/give back consolidate shit. Wednesday I bought 24.50 puts at right as it broke down after open, and they paid well. I also had 24's that went to 0. I'm done playing this stock until it shows some balls and conviction.\n\n# Let's Talk Entries/Exits\n\nOkay boys and girls, I'm going to do some educating really quickly.\n\nIn your day to day trading if you act on emotion: Stop.\n\nIf you see a stock shoot up 5% after open and you FOMO it and it's been 10 minutes since the bell rang: Stop.\n\nIf you didn't play Disney: You should have.\n\nIf you decide to do some investigating and pick plays to make this week, don't feel obligated to open your positions Monday first thing. Likewise, you should never really open positions within the first 15-20 minutes of trading for a day. It's likely (like with SPY often) that the peak it achieves during open will be the biggest swing you will see for the day, and it's likely there's the least conviction behind it.\n\nWhen I pick an entry point, I look at the trend I'm following, I look at the stock, I decide where I think it can reach, what I'm willing to bet that it does, and what kind of swing I'm playing for.\n\nThis brings me to earnings season: Normally, I'm looking to get into positions at least a week before an earnings report because I'm taking on a vega advantageous position (the increase in it, specifically), but I had bad planning that week.\n\nAnd at the end of the day, none of that matters this week. **BECAUSE ITS EARNINGS SEASON LETS** ***GOOOOOOOOOOOO.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Picks for Week of April 15th, 2019 [EARNINGS TIME]\n\n**All of the commentary on specific tickers are simply notes I wrote to myself. Each ticker listed is not a suggestion to buy or sell, but simply the ones I took notes on that I'm considering entering. These notes are not to you personally.**\n\nThis week I'm changing up how I do this. I'm offering the info that I see pertinent to the play I plan on making and if somebody decides to do their own DD and makes a similar trade, I won't always get dicked on my entries.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bank of America (BAC) - $30.17 -** ***BULLISH*** \\- **They report on Tuesday before open.** At this point, for me to bet against the banks it'd take a lot of conviction that a certain bank has a certain problem they can't overcome. People are borrowing like crazy still, we saw how strong the entire sector was Friday, and although Bank of America's been on a tear as of late I still think it has potential to really break above a long time range it's been stuck in. They popped hard on the other financial reports, but I don't think that diminishes their possibility to go further. They may correct in the day before earnings, so I'm going to look hard for a good entry. Market \n\n* **Expected Move - $1.04** \\- I think this is low. I think we can see a $1.50 move on earnings day, and I think that as long as orange man doesn't say stupid shit, we can probably tack on another 1-2% the rest of the week.\n* **Noteworthy Earnings Moves**\n   * FQ2 18 $28.55 -&gt; $29.78\n   * FQ4 18 $26.55 -&gt; $28.45 \n* **52 Week High: $31.91 -** This is important, because it's approaching a point where if it can get past this, we may see new money flood in and help push it higher. It all depends on volume and conviction though.\n* **Plays I'm Looking At -** I'm looking at FD's and longer dated calls on this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Atlassian (TEAM) - $112.68 -** ***BULLISH*** \\- **They report on Wednesday after close.** One of my businesses is a large scale development project, we have roughly 10 devs/designers/team members. We've been using Atlassian products for like 7 years. Every time something else pops out that integrates cleanly, we try it, often buy it. They've been getting subscriptions from me forever, and I'm grandfathered into a good plan on one of them. The fact is their culture/infrastructure/family of products pulls you in and doesn't let you go. Knowing a lot about the company personally, having a lot of experience with it and knowing how crucial it is to so many people, I assume their churn rate is pretty low historically/projected to stay low. This company is really on the come up. I'm bullish.\n\n* **Expected Move - $9.86** \\- They're a growing company and each time they prove it, they gain hand over fist. This might be exuberant -- but I really do think they have potential to become a $200 stock in the next 12 months.\n* **Noteworthy Earnings Moves**\n   * FQ1 18 $40.25 -&gt; $50.17 (25% HELLOOOO)\n   * FQ4 18 $66.83 -&gt; $73.84\n   * FQ1 19 $81.89 -&gt; $70.18 (by 11/28, a month later, it was exploding back above this price and basically fucking ignored the December selloff)\n* **52 Week High: $116.70 -** It solidly retraced its December lows back upwards, and has hesitated barely, with the regular gain/consolidate pattern upwards. I don't think it's slowing down.\n* **Plays I'm Looking At -** I'm looking at calls both FD's for the earnings move and Junes at a wide spread apart. I'm going to give the long dated ones room to play as a lotto ticket for as cheap as I can get them and assume the trend continues, and play the FD's for at least a 200% gain based on the move that is priced in being smaller than I think they'll gain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Netflix (NFLX) - $351.14** ***- BEARISH*** \\- **They report on Tuesday after close.** So, Netflix is a touchy subject for me. I've bet against them twice, and lost heavily on both plays. I bet for them, and lost both also. I basically was backwards both times. While I think they appropriately guided last time based on them saying most growth would be international for their last quarter, I think that Disney's meteoric rise on Friday followed by them losing 4.5% was an indication of the multiple this stock trades at -- and sentiment that people really think that Disney is a challenger. Once Apple actually announces their streaming specifics, I think they will be a contender also. That being said, I think a lot of people are of the belief that there is room for everyone, and while that's true, I see inevitable growth slowing with Netflix over the next two years because of the other companies entering the market. Not negative growth, but a curb of their exponential growth, and the need to spend more to acquire -- means lower EPS. I don't think the company will necessarily ever really fall to #2 in the department, but I think the stock is pretty overvalued right now unless they find a means to leverage their subscribers for more money. They can only raise prices so often though.\n\nThat all being said - once again, the entire economic situation seemed dire last quarter -- but I think of it this way: People knew that they weren't cancelling Netflix. You may buy less cars, you buy cheaper toilet paper, you don't cancel Netflix, because most people that come home from their shit job or tough day need it. They live for it. I don't think the economic situation really affects this company, and thus, they're at a PE of fucking 140. How far can this company really go? Can they get a billion subscribers? I just don't see that happening, I really don't.\n\nThey're also going to shell out $3 BILLION DOLLARS this year. That's almost double 2016, and a billion over 2017. That's a lot of dough man, and if their growth isn't still exponential, how do they plan to start increasing their free cash flow. It's on a downward spiral, so what's the deal? They just stop paying for content? Can't. Management says they will, but how the fuck will you keep the buzz going for the service with the introduction of two competitors? New people to streaming won't just automatically buy Netflix now, Disney or Apple may be the first stop. Stop advertising? Maybe, but that's probably a fraction of what they spend on infrastructure and content.\n\nLong story short, I'm betting against them in two ways.\n\n* **Expected Move - $25.30** \\- It could be way more, or way less than this. They may give away 10% and rally it back in two days. This stocks just so volatile around their earnings reports.\n* **Noteworthy Earnings Moves**\n   * FQ2 17 $161.70 -&gt; $183.60\n   * FQ4 17 $227.58 -&gt; $250.29\n   * FQ2 18 $400.48 -&gt; $379.48\n   * FQ4 18 $351.39 -&gt; $339.10\n* **52 Week High: $423.21 -** This stocks just really overvalued in my opinion. I understand their subs are worth something but I think before it gets back here, it's going to trace back below $300 at some point.\n* **Plays I'm Looking At -** I'm playing one or two at the money contracts on this probably, and maybe a way OTM straddle in May, but I'm not sure. It takes serious balls to bet against this stock, and it takes serious balls to play it period because the options are definitely appropriately priced, if not over priced, and it's a way to just light a bunch of fucking money on fire. It's earnings season though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EA (EA) - $101.83** ***- BULLISH*** \\- **They report on 5/7/19 after close.** I'm looking to start setting up some multi-leg and long term plays here. The fact of the matter is, I play Apex occasionally. I hate battle royale games, but I fucking love that game. My friends and I get fucked up and play once a week or so after we all get done working/with meetings. There is almost no chance they thought this game would blow up like it has, and regardless of the pull back in Twitch viewership, Apex did in 4 weeks what took Fortnite 16. Obviously, they share player bases, but I don't think it matters. Games cycle through this industry, and it's gone from PUBG, to H1Z1, to Fortnite, and I think Apex will continue making the company more money in the first year than they forecasted.\n\n* **My Target For Lotto's - $130-$140 by September** \\- They could hit this mark in the weeks after earnings, even. I think we'll see a rise in the coming weeks, especially if the software sector pops or gets any good news.\n* **52 Week High: $151.26 -** Seems this sector has lagged a bit on the recovery from December. I think that speaks to the room it has to run. Not really betting against it, more kids are born every day, and they floss their way around the house when I'm at family functions. Fuck, when I was a kid I just put olives on my fingers and ate them.\n* **Plays I'm Looking At -** I'm going to start accumulating cheap lotto options in big lots, that are quite a ways out of the money. I plan to add to my position slowly, and then liquidate some near earnings if the move starts running my way. I'll probably buy some FD's for the earnings week expiration, the week before, and if all works out, roll it into shares or more calls and ride it as long as I can.\n\n# State of the Market\n\nWe're approaching all time highs still and I'm pretty confident we'll be achieving them. Almost every company guided low for this quarter, and we're seeing slowly the economy wasn't nearly as bad as we thought. Evidence: Financial earnings on Friday. I think that we'll see a 3:1 or 4:1 beat/miss rate, and betting the upside during earnings this season is going to be pretty easy to profit. Doesn't mean I'm blindly yolo'ing the upside, but I'm definitely leaning that way if I'm ever on the fence. Unless it's Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. That company is shit.\n\n# About Correlated/Corresponding Picks\n\nCorrelated picks are important. An example is playing Apple/Facebook/Microsoft and SPY. If any of those gain, it's more likely SPY gains that week since it's weighted towards them, and the S&amp;P is weighted towards them. Calls in both double dips, but can see your money evaporate also. Buying tech sector puts and SPY calls makes no sense, for the exact same rationale unless it's a pure hedge against share value, or an isolated catalyst like a lawsuit or acquisition, in which case, it's probably going to pull the ETF/index down or up with it anyway. The best way to double dip is to find complimentary positions. Example: Verizon on top of Apple is good - if their streaming service is good and requires iPhone hardware, the market may see a boost in iPhone sales from Verizon and ATT, etc. Corresponding plays.\n\n# Will You Cover This Ticker/Give Me Your Thoughts On This?\n\nEdit: Not doing this \n\nIf you've got something you are eyeing, I'll occasionally be willing to offer my thoughts on the company and the underlying. **I can not, and will not tell you when to enter/exit/buy/sell any stock or option,** however. I will simply say what I think about the specific ticker and their outlook. Once again, it is simply **my opinion and not advice.** **If you ask for a ticker overview, include the ticker symbol with a $, like $AAPL,** so I can just search the thread for them. I probably won't go over them all and likely already have my thoughts on many, but I'll try to reply with thoughts on many. The threads will get longer week by week, so try to understand if I don't get to all of them. Below is a list of stocks I won't cover, and it will grow week by week. If you ask me specifically for advice on your own position, or situation, I'll simply ignore your comment. This warning is all over the post.\n\n**BEFORE YOU ASK FOR A TICKER:** Lots of people ask for the same thing, I don't mind adding color commentary on specifics if you have a question about a certain aspect of the company, but please just load all the comments and CTRL+F (CMD+F for Mac) and look for that ticker to see if there's a conversation going on about it already.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Private Messages/Chat Requests:**  Hit me up if you have questions. I may or may not respond. Depends if the question is stupid or not.", "created_utc": 1555302522, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bdbymf/i_pick_options_so_you_dont_have_to_earnings/", "is_self": true}
