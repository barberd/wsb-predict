Never been profitable. Never paid out dividends. Revenue growth, so a retard bull would be inclined to say \"stonk go up!!\". Revenue is fucking low anyway. Their debt is trash. CR of 4.57 is very good.  \n  \n## NASDAQ:ZM | Zoom  \n| Market Cap | Stonk Price | EPS    | P/E ratio | Dividend Yield % | 52 week range  |  \n| ---------- | ----------- | ------ | --------- | ---------------- | -------------- |  \n| 66.79B     | 241.78      | 0.18   | 1309.01   | N/A              | 60.97 - 243.83 |  \n  \nYou all know this fucking stupid stonk. Ever heard of Microsoft Teams, Skype For Business, Discord, Slack, Google Hangouts and probably a thousand other solutions?  \nThe last 4 quarters were so great. 0.52 EPS annualized, with nice growth. Good revenue growth too! Never paid dividends. CR of 1.72 is decent. Debt isn't too bad, but still not very impressive for a tech company. Their margins are poo-poo. Not at all overpriced, P/E doesn't matter! New paradigm!  \n  \n## NYSE:SHOP | Shopify  \n| Market Cap | Stonk Price | EPS    | P/E ratio | Dividend Yield % | 52 week range  |  \n| ---------- | ----------- | ------ | --------- | ---------------- | -------------- |  \n| 99.32B     | 862.50      | ~0.60  | N/A       | N/A              | 281.69 - 860   | \n  \nShopify actually has a good product, and is miles ahead of its competition. (Other website builders for small business/dropshipping/noob-e-comm. Valuation doesn't make sense though. Their revenue dropped in that second quarter of 2020. EPS dropped too. Short track record. Never paid dividends. Debt to Equity is incredible on this one! Furthermore, CR is 9.45, which is extremely good. Lockdown and future e-comm won't boost their customer demographics at all. Huge corporations will take the e-comm market share, and they won't be using Shopify. Most private sellers/small businesses are about to run out of money to spend on stupid shit, and they probably can't compete with the big boys.  \n  \n## NASDAQ:NFLX | Netflix  \n| Market Cap | Stonk Price | EPS    | P/E ratio | Dividend Yield % | 52 week range  |  \n| ---------- | ----------- | ------ | --------- | ---------------- | -------------- |  \n| 195.28B    | 444.71      | 4.66   | 96.16     | N/A              | 442.8 - 452.6  |  \n  \nProduct is OK I guess. They have major competition now, though, and will have to fight Disney, Amazon, HBO, AMC, and probably many more.  At least they're profitable, which is a rare sight in tech. CR of 0.82 is garbage. Very high debt. Never paid dividends. Earnings growth is pretty consistent. Revenue growth is consistent as well.  \n  \nCBA to write more since reddit markdown is retarded. lmk if you want p2 of an autistic take on stonk market", "created_utc": 1592495388.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hbh6gx/mega_dd_on_stonks/", "is_self": true}
