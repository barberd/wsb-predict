{"id": "hbgj51", "title": "Why Carvana ($CVNA) is a good short", "selftext": "Anyone still remember Beepi? a failed startup looking to disrupt the auto marketplace. They went out of business in 2016 after burning through all their massive pile of cash. There are many reasons why they went out of business, but the ultimate reason is the simple fact that cars depreciate overtime. Keep in mind Beepi went out of business in 2016 even though the economy was the strongest during that time. It was the golden years for businesses and startup alike, yet they still failed.\n\nWhat makes Carvana different? Nothing really. Carvana is currently valued at 20b. In 2019, Carvana burned through nearly $1 billion alone. During the fourth quarter, the company burned about $400 million on $1.1 billion in revenue. Imagine how much they're burning through right now given the current COVID environment. An employee posted on [r/Carvana](https://www.reddit.com/r/carvana/comments/fkfhsk/delays_are_likely_from_an_employee/) stating \"COVID-19 has shut down government agencies including the DMV in many states. Carvana has taken extra steps to prevent employees and customers from exposure. Additional precautions are being taken to sanitize vehicles before delivery. There is much uncertainty moving forward. This will inevitably cause delays with registration and delivery\". There's a lot of profit to be made from shorting this company. Can't go tits up.\n\nThe auto industry was already bracing for a brutal year even before the Ronavirus. Automakers worldwide had at least 20 percent more factory capacity than they needed before the Ronavirus hit, according to the New York Times. That idle manufacturing space cost them money without producing any profit. On the other hand, there are obvious reasons demand for cars would fall. With tens of millions of people out of work, unemployment is usually not a great time for anyone to make a large purchase. Even people who remain employed have been driving a lot less over the last few months, and many workers are likely to continue working from home for the rest of the year. People who aren\u2019t using their cars so much might not feel any urgency to buy something newer. And the longer that severe disruptions to the economy persist, the more damage there should be to consumer demand overall, especially if JPow continues to print digitally.\n\nBuying a new or used car is a big financial decision anyone can make. A large financial investment only secondary to a home needs to be thoroughly analyzed before signing the dotted line. A buyer would probably want the hands on experience of shopping for a car in person instead of buying it online. They want to see what's under the hood, feel the interiors, kick the tires and most importantly test drive a car to know if it is something they really want.\n\nPosition: CVNA 100 P Jan 15, 2021 (Fri: 212 days)", "created_utc": 1592493364.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hbgj51/why_carvana_cvna_is_a_good_short/", "is_self": true}
