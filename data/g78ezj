{"id": "g78ezj", "title": "GILD TP Hands", "selftext": "Yesterday 4/23 around 12:40pm, Gilead got bad press that their supposed COVID-19 drug Remdesivir has performed poorly in trials, causing the stock to plummet 8 points (about 12% of its value) in seconds.  This was a week after Gilead shot up an equal amount due to anecdotal evidence that their drug was a very strong treatment for COVID-19.  There was a bunch of DD on this sub about how why Gilead's climb was based on bad science, so I shorted the stock, purchasing GILD $70p 5/15 at 1.84 a share on 4/17.  \n\n\nOn 4/22, my GILD option was worth about 150%, but my Diamond Hands didnt allow me to sell, GILD climbed back into the 80s, and my option lost value.    \n\n\nYesterday, around noon, with my GILD put being worth about 70%, and having to leave the house for errands, I set a Limit Sell for break even on my Options, offering the contracts for 1.84 (what I paid).   Much to my surprise the option filled very quickly, as bad news about Remdesivir tanked GILD stock.    \n\n\nUnfortunately for me and my TP Hands, my option sold at break even instead of over 4.00 a share a few minutes later.   Had I not sold, I could have made 3x on my option just a few minutes after it sold.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y7hthvnrnru41.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=7452d2b0378871c7d637f6d0fb58392c826aa7e7", "created_utc": 1587735079.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g78ezj/gild_tp_hands/", "is_self": true}
