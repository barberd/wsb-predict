Let that sink in a bit, the option to sell oil at 0.5 costs 1.16. Wow, just fucking wow. At an IV level that is #n/a. \n\nExcept instead of buying this, you sell the fucker. Why? Because brokers are stupid, and quants even more so, they have a zero floor to price in their dumb ass risk models such that the margin required on this trade is a dumroll... 200 bucks, whereas its normally 10k to short one $1 CL option. \n\nTheres your opening autists. You can afford 200 margin? Short that sweet four digit IV!!! Go all out for a 1000 contract million barrel position. Tendies or death!!! (for the broker)  \n\nIf it goes to - 37 again you will be the all time greatest autist ever, with a 36k per contract loss. You get to invent your own sound to replace 'guh'. Win win. \n\nNote, this is not financial advice. CL is the crude future ticker.
