{"id": "g1fa5w", "title": "Stimulus checks = firearm sales", "selftext": "# Let's talk gun stocks.\n\nAnd no, I'm not talking about the stocks on the back of the physical gun itself. I'm talking about capitalism, idiot.\n\nI came from a relatively poor, rural, small-town background. Literally lived on a cattle farm. Don't get me wrong, I traded in my cow shit for the bullshit of the corporate world by fleeing to the city for a high-stress job as soon as opportunity presented itself.\n\nAll this is to say: I know where these stimulus checks are going. And it isn't into the stock market, morons. (unless you're getting one and planning on YOLOing it on TSLA calls or SPY puts. If that's the case, Godspeed.)\n\nMy brother got his check yesterday. He bought a gun.\n\nMy dad got his check yesterday. Bought 2 guns.\n\nI have morons on my Facebook feed posting wild shit about having to wait in line at Bass Pro for HOURS to buy guns and ammo with their newly cashed stim checks.\n\nTheir rationale is always the same. The world is taking a shit, times are uncertain, and we don't have any clue how long Bass Pro can be expected to stay open. \"I've only got a shotgun in my house right now, man. I need a handgun for emergencies.\" said my brother **who was recently laid off and has no health insurance.**\n\nThis is what we do. We take a look at the world, see uncertainty, feel the faux need to protect our property, families, etc...and we go buy guns and ammo. Welcome to America. Love it or leave it.\n\nSo where's an autist to put his/her money to capitalize on the inevitable terrible judgement of rural America (sorry, rural America. I love you, but you guys fucking suck at making money management decisions.)\n\n**Let's talk Ruger (RGR)**\n\nI want to first caveat this suggestion by stating that, as of right now, the options on Ruger Firearms carry very low volume and little outstanding interest. That could easily change, and will, if this thing starts to bounce like I think it will.\n\nBut hear me out here. The better play on RGR is to just buy shares. Yes, that's right. Be a peasant. Buy shares. \"But that's not risky enough for me!\" you say.\n\nStop it. Just look at their 3 month chart! They've been on one of the most steady inclines of any stock you'll see since March 12. $39 to over $52 in that short span.\n\nAnd it will not stop.\n\nAnd for those of you who love the thrill of the options bet, let me give you a little history lesson.\n\nThe year is 2009. Barack Obama and team have just passed the ARRA, ensuring that downtrodden Americans will soon get stimulated via cash money. That money will go out some time in February, March-ish.\n\nAnd what did Americans do with their money?\n\nThat's right. They bought guns.\n\n**On February 13th, 2009, Ruger's stock sat at just over $6 a share. By April 3rd it had skyrocketed to $12 a share, doubling its value.**\n\nThis was the start of a massive incline for the company, which topped out at close to $80 a share back in 2014, and they've held up relatively well since.\n\nThe other piece of importance here, is that gun sales ALWAYS increase in the late spring, early summer months. Look up any other firearms brand stock (AOBC, VSTO), and you'll see that **they all spike in June/July. This will amplify that effect.**\n\nIf you're looking for an option play, look into the 7/15 52.5c. Again, volume is currently shit and B/A spread is $1...which is why I'm recommending this as a straight common buy play.\n\nTL;DR: Buy shares of Ruger Firearms before the stimulus checks go out en masse. Americans love guns...especially when they can buy them with govt money at a time when the world seems like it's burning.", "created_utc": 1586902991.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1fa5w/stimulus_checks_firearm_sales/", "is_self": true}
