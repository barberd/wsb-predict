{"id": "bfql6z", "title": "Canadian Company Food APP Ritual", "selftext": "Canadian food pickup app Ritual offers no fees/markup when ordering food through its app. In addition, you receive points redeemable for discounts or cash credits when you purchase food. Average effective cash back is between 2-4%. I\u2019ve managed to game it to about 20% cash back through its promotions. \n\nIt\u2019s a wonder how VC funds pour millions into this company, despite the model literally losing money with every purchase. \n\nThey\u2019ve recently started offering 5$ [off](https://imgur.com/gallery/WEHUiny) daily for first visits at a restaurant. I\u2019ve taken advantage of this to grab me some tendies. \n\nIt\u2019s amazing how the name of the game in modern VC funding world is to never look at profitability or even the path to profitability. When this IPOs, it will probably IPO at like 10-20x revenue multiple. Absolutely ludicrous. Uber should offer the same, they\u2019d be able to IPO at 200b valuation then.", "created_utc": 1555864060, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bfql6z/canadian_company_food_app_ritual/", "is_self": true}
