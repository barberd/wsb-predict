{"id": "et1utg", "title": "Who moved my options? An adaptation of the best selling \"Who moved my cheese!\" book", "selftext": "*Who Moved My Options?* features four characters: two bulls, \"Sniff\" and \"Scurry,\" and two bears, \"Hem\" and \"Haw.\"  (The names of the bears are taken  from the phrase \"hem and haw,\" a term for indecisiveness.)  They live in  a maze, a representation of one's environment, and look for profitable YOLOs,  representative of happiness and success. Initially without open options, each  group, the bulls and bears, paired off and traveled the lengthy  market searching for options. One day both groups happen upon a low IV-filled options corridor at $SPY. Content with their find,  the bears establish routines around their daily purchase of puts on each dip,  slowly becoming arrogant in the process. \n\nOne day Sniff and Scurry arrive at $SPY and find no profitable options left, but they are not surprised. Noticing the option supply  dwindling, they have mentally prepared beforehand for the arduous but  inevitable task of finding more profitable YOLOs. Leaving $SPY,  they begin their hunt for new options together. Later that day, Hem and  Haw arrive at $SPY only to find the same thing, no options.  Angered and annoyed, Hem demands, \"Why is $SPY still going up in this overbought market!?\" The bears have  counted on the profitable put option supply to be constant, and so are unprepared for  this eventuality. After deciding that the put options are indeed gone they get  angry at the unfairness of the situation. Haw suggests a search for new  puts, but Hem is dead-set in his disappointment and dismisses the  proposal, continuing to buy worthless puts until his account is near 0. \n\nMeanwhile, Sniff and Scurry have found $TSLA calls. But back at $SPY Hem and Haw are affected by  their lack of profitable puts and blame each other for their problem. Hoping to  change, Haw again proposes a change to bull team and eyes $TSLA and $SPCE. However, Hem is  comforted by his old routine and is frightened about the unknown. He  knocks the idea again. After a while of being in denial, the bears  remain without puts. One day, having discovered his debilitating  fears, Haw begins to chuckle at the situation and stops taking himself  so seriously. Realizing he should simply become a bull, Haw enters the maze,  but not before chiseling \"If You Do Not Stop Buying Puts, You Can Become Extinct\"  on the wall of $SPY for his friend to ponder. \n\nStill fearful of his trek, Haw jots \"What Would You YOLO If You  Weren't Afraid?\" on the wall and, after thinking about that, he begins  his venture. Still plagued with worry (perhaps he has waited too long to  begin his search...), Haw finds some BYND calls that nourish him  and he is able to continue his search. Haw realizes that the profitable options have  not suddenly vanished, but has dwindled from continual put buying. After a  stop at $BYND, Haw begins worrying about the unknown  again. Brushing aside his fears, Haw's new mindset allows him to again  enjoy life. He has even begun to smile again! He is realizing that \"When you stop buying puts, you feel free.\" After bagging a LEAP SPCE call, Haw decides to go back for Hem with the gains he has realized. \n\nUncompromising, Hem refuses to buy calls, to his friend's  disappointment. With knowledge learned along the way, Haw heads back  into the maze of the market. Getting deeper into the market, inspired by bits of new  tickers here and there, Haw leaves a trail of writings on the wall.  These clarify his own thinking and give him hope that his friend will  find aid in them during his search for new options. Still traveling, Haw  one day comes across $TSLA, abundant with call strategies, including  some varieties that are strange to him, and he realizes he has found  what he was looking for. After closing, Haw reflects on his experience.  He ponders a return to see his old friend. But Haw decides to let Hem  find his own way. Finding the largest wall on WSB daily discussion, he  writes: \n\n**Change Happens** *Puts keep expiring worthless*  \n**Anticipate Change** *Get Ready for puts to expire worthless*   \n**Monitor Change** *Smell the tickers often So You Know When It Is Getting Old*   \n**Adapt To Change Quickly** *The Quicker You Let Go Of Puts, The Sooner You Can Enjoy Calls*   \n**Change** *Move With The Bulls*   \n**Enjoy Change!** *Savor The Last of the Upwards Market And Enjoy The Taste Of Calls!* \n\nCautious from past experience, Haw now inspects $TSLA  daily and explores different parts of the market regularly to prevent any  complacency from setting in. After hearing movement in the maze one day,  Haw realizes someone is approaching the station. Unsure, Haw hopes that  it is his friend Hem who has found the way.   \n\n\nUnfortunately, the day Hem decided to finally buy OTM calls on SPCE, the stock lost 5%.", "created_utc": 1579823668, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/et1utg/who_moved_my_options_an_adaptation_of_the_best/", "is_self": true}
