GSX TECHEDU ($GSX) is a massively fraudulent Chinese e-learning company that rose to recent fame due to the \u201cstay at home\u201d Coronavirus growth spurt. They provide online classes, as well as private tutors, for students across all levels within the APAC region. 70-80% of their users are fake. \n\n\nFor the reasons below, and because I have looked at the Muddy Waters, Citron, and JCAB reports myself, I am all in on puts. Citron report attached for review (it\u2019s shocking shit): \n\n\n1) There are currently a handful of lawsuits on behalf of investors against GSX for the reason stated above. HAGENS, BERMAN, NATIONAL TRIAL ATTORNEYS are leading the most recent charge\n\n\u201cThe complaint alleges defendants misreported GSX financials, student enrollment figures, and teacher qualifications.\u201d\n\n\n\n2) Feb 25,2020: Investors begin learning the truth when GRIZZLY RESEARCH publishes scathing report about fake enrollment figures and mass bot use\n\n\n\n3) April 14,2020: CITRON RESEARCH runs their own analysis and comes up with similar conclusions, claiming they falsified revenues by 70% and overstated net profits by 75% (report attached because it\u2019s incredible)\n\n\n\n4) May 7,2020: CITRON publishes another report, citing \u201cdefinitive evidence\u201d of GSX commuting massive \u201csecurities fraud,\u201d claiming they understated customer acquisition costs by moving expenses off the books to shell companies \n\n\n\n5) May 18,2020: MUDDY WATERS enters the chat. They do their own proprietary analysis and find \u201cnear-total fraud\u201d. They claim 70-80% of users are fake. \n******(Keep in mind these guys were the ones who found out and accused Luckin Coffee....)\n\n\n\n6) May 28,2020: MUDDY WATERS cited additional evidence of fabrication of user numbers. Including an account from a GSX manager\n\n\n\n7) June 2,2020: GRIZZLY RESEARCH follows up initial report with an absolutely brutal assessment; they claim that GSX \u201cpublicly claimed student enrollment count and revenue are inflated by approximately 900%\u201d while also \u201cappearing to be conducting illegal marketing activities on a massive scale.\u201d  Additionally, they believe that GSX\u2019s \u201ccore marketing strategy is built around IDENTITY THEFT.\u201d Just let that sink in for one second ...\n\n\n\n8) June 23,2020: Most recently a former manager at GSX was recorded on audio call outright admitting that each employee controls approximately 500-1000 phones each, and they use bots to push up enrollment figures which directly affect revenue figures. \n\n\n\n\nThis company is a fraud beyond frauds. They may even be committing identify fraud. If you have shares, jump ship immediately imo. Ball is in their court, they will have to respond. \n\n\nFor me, I\u2019m gay for this stock:\n\n\n\nPosition: $GSX $25 PUT 8/21\n\n\n\nReport: https://citronresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GSX-Techedu-The-Most-Blatant-Chinese-Stock-Fraud-Since-2011-ver2.pdf", "created_utc": 1593640211.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hjjxxp/gsx_techedu_gsx_the_most_blatant_chinese_fraud/", "is_self": true}
