We need YOUR help to make sure we feast on tendies and quaaludes tonight, which is why you should follow these three easy steps:\n\n1. Sell every asset you own, including your first born and your deceased mother in law's wedding ring, and place ~90-100 put orders in for UBER.\n\n2. Download the Uber app with your newly acquired iPhone 4, because you sold your old phone to a crack dealer for 30$. Then apply to become a driver and wait. \n\n3. Wait until you're on the highway and then put a brick on the pedal, sailing your car over the median. Uber will have more PR problems than they do quarterly loses.\n\nThat's it. Then we watch our Robinhood accounts from the hospital bed and realize all our profits are going to go to hospital bills.
