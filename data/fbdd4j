{"id": "fbdd4j", "title": "Corona in Cambodia", "selftext": "Here is some DD regarding Cambodia and its cases of Corona I got from close friends and relatives there. In the news, you see there has only been 1 reported corona case.\n\n- The US embassy states that there\u2019s only 1 testing center in whole country and the corrupt government decides on who is testing \u201cunder certain circumstances\u201d. \n\n- Cousin recently was feeling ill, 23 F, and the doctor told her he has been seeing a lot of similar conditions for patients recently. She is well off so he suggested moving to an area with a close family to quarantine herself from the area. \n\n- Cambodia has a huge amount of Chinese National into one of their cities which is LOADED with Chinese Casinos. There has been about dozens Chinese National just dropping dead on the streets like previous videos in China. \n\n- also, their fucking Prime Minister has not closed flights from China yet. Actually they have NO travel restrictions from anywhere. \n\nAll in all, this is just one fucked up reason why this shit will spread. Cambodia is bad, but all the other governments are doing the same. Thailand, Vietnam, Iran, etc. it\u2019s either gross incompetence or straight up retardedness that will cause a huge pandemic under our eyes. \n\nIf you haven\u2019t, load up on supplies and food. When shit goes down in your area, it will be \u201covernight\u201d and there will be no time to prepare.
