LISTEN TO ME. \n\nThe Saudis vs. the Russians are battling to tank oil prices during a time when nobody WANTS OIL anyway! It's just a fake! Obvious their motive is to fuck US OIL, and persuade US to join their Oligopoly or go Bankrupt. \n\nBut the 4D CHESS play is the Saudis are now investing in companies that benefit from low oil prices, and have ALREADY parshally tanked due to their 'price war' - CARNIVAL CRUISE LINES! And they'll invest in more BIG OIL USING COMPANIES next! HEAD MY CALL!\n\nOil prices WILL NOT RISE THIS YEAR!\n\nDO U GET IT NOW??", "created_utc": 1586395329.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxj4tz/the_mid_con_on_oil_by_the_house_of_saudi/", "is_self": true}
