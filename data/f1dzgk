Make a slightly ITM call and sell end of Monday or Tuesday?\n\nPersonally don\u2019t find coronavirus to be that concerning but with the media overload I\ufe0f could see heavy purchases of this existing solution to stock up on, driving some gainz.  Did I\ufe0f look into the rest of their performance? Yeah, a little underwhelming, shitty EPS but margins are good.  Target price of 76.39 but trading at 68.87 right now.  A quick pop off the press seems imminent tho?\n\nAm I\ufe0f fuckin retarded?  \n\nFeb 14 $69 call for $1.60\n\nDelta: .5249\nTheta: -.1139\nGamma: .1015\nVegina: .0381\nRho: .0066\nChance of profit: 34.24%\nIV: 40.98%\n\nI\ufe0f will basically be willing to exercise the contract or sell it outright, whatever pays better at the end of Monday or sometime Tuesday.
