This is purely for my entertainment. But after finding out about SPCE I took my trashy ui charles schwab 16 year old custodial account and my measly $130 and YOLO'd on SPCE. I thought it hit the mountain's peak yesterday at $17, but I was wrong and it went to $20. All in'd on SPCE. To the moon $20 is not the top. Literally can't go down any farther and if it does just wait. Some rich idiot will pay $500k to send his pet goldfish to space and stock will soar. The stock goes back down to $10? Sure the bears will be laughing but when the goldfish is launched into space, investors will buy, prices will soar, and they'll be down $50k on their precious little puts while still holding because \"well the goldfish is going to die and price is going to go down again\". Well guess what? Some other rich idiot with a pet beta fish will send his into space and then the price soars again. Enjoy being down $100k when you could have cut your losses at $50k.\n\nTo the moon.", "created_utc": 1579759390, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/esozse/i_finally_gave_in/", "is_self": true}
