This is a fact and we can be statistically confident that its going to stay that way unless the virus mutates into something more deadly that affects even younger age groups (extremely unlikely).\n\nCoupled with trumpbux + savings due to not paying for transport, restaurants, coffee, etc, the younger generation are building up quite a war chest to unleash into the economy once they are set free from the lockdown. Some may even have large windfalls of inheritance money, but I am not sure how big the effect will be since there is no data on this.\n\nJudging by how stocks have been going up despite all the negative doomsday tier signs, I can only assume all this money is slowly being pumped into stocks right now. Once the lockdown is lifted this summer, I suspect there will be a huge bump in spending again in the economy which will (as much as I hate to admit) indeed lead to a \"V\" shaped recovery for Q2 and Q3. Sure, there may be a rise in infections, which may spook the markets temporarily, but people who are at high risk from covid won't be going out anyway. Hence we will generally see a gradual decline in deaths over the summer, which is sadly extremely bullish.\n\nWhat about the millions of unemployed, you may ask? Good question. However, I think the market honestly doesn't care at this point since its priced in that effect and looking ahead at growth 1 - 2 years from now. Maybe they'll all get their jobs back within a few months. Maybe they'll be reclassified as \"employed\" even if they do just 1 hour of gig work a week. I don't know. Statistics can and will be fudged to make the market happy.\n\nWhat about commercial real estate? Another good question. Its yet to be seen how deep this work from home trend sinks in for companies to decide to ditch the office altogether. Bearing in mind that a lot of office leases are 3-5 years long on average, its a bit hard legally for a company to just cancel their contracts this year even if they wanted to.\n\nSo summing up, I think theres a real possibility of the markets retesting the highs of January just before the US election in November.  By that time, its quite possible we may even have a vaccine ready considering every scientist and biotech firm in the world is highly motivated to get one out ASAP. Regardless of whether the vaccine ultimately works or not is irrelevant. The mere announcement of a vaccine is enough to pump the markets on hopium for the rest of the year.\n\nOf course, I am ignoring other possible black swans like another debt crisis or the dollar collapsing  due to all this \"money printing\". But those  theories are generally promoted by the perma-doomer crowd who have predicted 20 of the last 3 recessions this 21st century.
