{"id": "hcck61", "title": "This is not the best DD you will read today.", "selftext": "just checked out some stock news and saw the headline from three hours ago that Apple closed 4 stores due to Covid rising.  The last crash on Feb 19th was preceded by apple stating that they were closing stores and that the disruption in china would hurt their numbers in the first and second quarters.  I heard apples news for about a week straight until a few more companies said they too expected to miss earnings. I remember not listening, holding risky stocks, and buying long positions on margin.  Well apple is at it again, Covid is ramping up faster than ever. stocks are beginning to decline or kangarooing which is a sign of uncertainty. and I have more long positions on Margin!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think next week will be red for a couple days. then a slight recovery on late wednesday or thursday from people \"buying the dip\" followed buy massive profit takers and fear sellers evacuating their entire portfolios followed by another crash which I estimate will last 2 to 3 weeks, fall  20% - 25% overall.  I don't recommend selling your portfolios unless you need cash or have made massive profits.  but have cash ready and buy some short and long puts to hedge!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nalso I have no fucking clue what I'm talking about but this is my prediction.", "created_utc": 1592613693.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hcck61/this_is_not_the_best_dd_you_will_read_today/", "is_self": true}
