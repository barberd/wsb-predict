We go to school and get rewarded for being good followers, throwing around details about where we went to school or work as if any of that shit mattered and glamorizing our life on LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram or whatever narcissism-promoting platform to make us feel better about ourselves.\n\nAt the same time, we use apps like Robinhood to try to fuck each over in the markets. If you think about it, the money you're making is at the expense of someone else losing. Society is just one Darwinistic joke that doesn't really have any sense or purpose.\n\nLet's say you make a shitload from those AMD or SPY calls. Then what? First you'll pay the tax man. And since you're here on WSB you'll likely throw it back in the market to only lose that plus more. Then you'll show off your loss porn to a bunch of random strangers to get some validation for being retarded. Or maybe just buy a bunch of shit you don't need so that we can fit in nicely with our consumerist culture.\n\nThis all being said, how do you short society and the simulation we live in? And what do you guys do to bring more meaning into your life besides prescription drugs and hookers?\n\nDisclosure: Found out recently one of my friends in grade school developed a rare brain disease and can no longer speak or take care of himself. I'm also bear gang going short SPY which may also be impacting my state of mind.", "created_utc": 1566271093, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/css336/whats_the_point_of_all_this_shit/", "is_self": true}
