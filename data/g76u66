In every portfolio they own, the largest majority of the loans are written in Michigan, which has been hit exceptionally hard.  All of the loans are sub-600 FICO with 22%+ interest and built for defaults to occur. Once someone defaults on the loan, wages are garnished, the vehicle is recovered and sold at auction to recoup as much as possible.  They sell you a car for 15k (worth 10k) for you to drive it off, pay a few months, then sell it at auction for face value. Rinse and repeat.\n\nSo what happens when A. wages cannot be garnished and B. the auctions are not moving cars? $CACC is stuck with the bill and incredibly vulnerable to collapsing.", "created_utc": 1587728148.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g76u66/cacc_dd/", "is_self": true}
