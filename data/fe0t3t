Currently, OKTA is not profitable. OKTA has beat earnings 100% of the time for the past 2 years. However, the earnings performance was not always positive. This means that outside of beating earnings, OKTA must navigate both profit-collection and lackluster guidance. Okta currently does not pay a dividend. One risk factor is OKTA\u2019s D/E Ratio, which is 230+. This is incredibly high and poses a risk for long term OKTA holders. \n\n**Technical**: Price at the 50D moving average, below the 20 day MA and above the 200DMA.  MACD shows bullish divergence. RSI shows around 50. Options sentiments are bullish in volume and bearish open interest. Implied movement is 7.4% or about 9.56$ Short interest is at 6.6%, with 6.9 days to cover. \n\n**Sentimental**: Being an unprofitable tech growth company is current macro conditions is very risky. Extrapolating SPLK\u2019s earnings, we can say that the market expectations for profitable company was already very high. OKTA must continue its streak while proving that they can hit profitability. Any mistakes will be heavily punished. Currently, its EPS and Revenue revisions have been very bullish, in addition to a recent price correction from the 140\u2019s. While I believe OKTA will beat earnings, the guidance will not be bullish enough for the stock to pop. \n\n**Robinhood (3/5/2020) Less Fucky. Not using. Moving to Schwab this weekend.** \n\n**Call Credit Spread 3/13 - Easier one**\n\n**Buy 140 Call**\n\n**Sell 135 Call**\n\n**Iron Condors 3/06 - much riskier**\n\n**117/139, 2$ width.**\n\n**There are lofty expectations on OKTA right now and with the given environment, I don\u2019t think they will be satisfied. Profitability remains an issue alongside massive debt.**", "created_utc": 1583437542.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fe0t3t/okta_okta_352020_amc_great_record_probably_flat/", "is_self": true}
