The truth is, since we're being propped up on bs the market won't start its decline until we reopen. Like others have said , people expect everything to magically pop right back to \"normal\". \n\nWhen that doesn't happen and unemployment stays relatively high and consumer confidence stays low everything will begin to tumble. \n\nIn the meantime , I've been getting tendies buying SPY calls for EOW every Wednesday or so and selling at open on Friday (No joke this has been like clockwork printing for me) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n(ALSO : Make rules for yourself when you take a position like \" I'll get out if I'm wrong and I'm down a certain amount\" / \"I'll get out if I'm right and I'm up a certain amount\" so you don't get caught with your pants down and arms in the honey tree waiting for bees to impregnate you)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL:DR Stop buying puts until we're about to reopen. \n\nPositions : SPY $277.5 4/24 Call (Bought this morning, already up) , ATVI $62 5/8 Call", "created_utc": 1587653926.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6o5bn/stop_losing_your_honey_pooh_bear/", "is_self": true}
