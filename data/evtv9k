{"id": "evtv9k", "title": "Petition to make a \"How Did Your Trades Work Out?\" sticky", "selftext": "This would replace or supplement the daily thread \"What are your moves for tomorrow.\" I think it would spark some good entertainment.\n\nThis would allow for people to post their winnings and losses, talk through the trades they already made or closed. It might alleviate a lot of bullshit posts that don't reach the standard for a new thread.\n\nI'll give you an example of how I would use it: \n\nI posted some loss porn a few months ago about the bath I took on SQ calls. I have since clawed my way back making somewhat more conservative plays on AYX, MSFT and SPY. I wouldn't necessarily post these trades back in their own thread and posting in my old SQ thread wouldn't bump it back to the main page.\n\nIt would be nice to be able to just toss out a, \"I made $500 in a quick turn around on TGT dipping.\" If you're an active poster, you are likely in the main thread of the day saying, \"Bought 10 SPY OTM Calls\" At the end of the day, you might close them out and it would be helpful to see, \"I lost $300 cause I closed my SPY Calls too early.\" \"I have weak lady hands and could have made $500 more if I held another hour.\" \"I bought a TSLA option and I don't know what that is but I'm about to lose my house\" \"Thank God for my Godking Elon because I bought a second house and I STILL don't know what an option is.\"\n\nUltimately, I think everyone wants to know the end of a story more than the beginning, so this thread would provide a nice compliment to the day threads or even the after-hour thread about their plans: How did they work out?", "created_utc": 1580334240, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/evtv9k/petition_to_make_a_how_did_your_trades_work_out/", "is_self": true}
