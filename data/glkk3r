Their cost are growing massively due to the security issues, and bandwidth. Their revenue not so much. Only risk is CEO saying some stupid shit about how many users are logging in when that is pretty irrelevant if you can't monetize it. \n\nSo if June earnings suck and it's timed with States re-opening, I might make my money back.\n\nIf your not in it, buy calls soon, and start adding puts as we get closer to 180 and earnings.\n\nPosition:\nZM: 6/19 160p, 08/21 150p, 08/21 140p", "created_utc": 1589740204.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/glkk3r/zoom_is_going_down_and_i_need_it_to_do_so_now/", "is_self": true}
