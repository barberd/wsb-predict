The rule is like a book, I'm sure creative accounting and a great lawyer team can argue ur not really breaking it even though in essence the banks probably were.\n\nThe Fed's goal is to understand systematic risk. The more banks hide what they're doing the harder it makes the Fed's job, and the Fed clearly realizes that they need to backstop shit but they need to know what is going to collapse in order to do it effectively. IMO this rule was eased so banks are more forward about their positioning.\n\nNow that they don't have to hide the fact that they're breaking it though they're going to rapidly expand previous forbidden activities. What does that mean short term? I honestly have no idea and would love to hear what u fuking idiots think\n\nMedium term?\n\nLong term the only thing I can think is that clearly we have more risk in the system, but I think that expanded risk will take awhile to actually be an issue. Unless we were already about to blow up in which case the banks are going to go to war with each other to blow each other up lmao", "created_utc": 1593216208.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hgj5lm/shortmediumlong_term_implications_of_volker_rule/", "is_self": true}
