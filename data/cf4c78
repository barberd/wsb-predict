Thanks $NFLX", "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Well boys, looks like I messed up.](https://i.redd.it/bvz10ukzj7b31.jpg)\n\nI did a calendar spread on NFLX before earnings (opened last week). I sold the 7/19 370 Put and bought the 7/26 370 Puts. Classic right?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell I nailed it on earnings. Thankfully I closed out from 10 contracts to only 2 long and 2 short before they declared earnings. I'm guessing in everyone's panic to cover their short puts expiring Friday before they got exercised this caused the weekly to increase 300% whilst my put with a bit of time value only increased 150%. Technically 100% loss however I still own these puts to exercise so I'm covered right? Worse case risk-less exercise and I lose the premium I paid\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGot a notification at 10PM Mountain time that \"My order for 200 NFLX has executed at 370\" and immediately go OH SHIT and check my account.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n35K margin call in my sub 10K account. Didn't get the notice till 10 at night which I thought was strange.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Pre-market 7\\/19\\/2019](https://i.redd.it/366689w2l7b31.jpg)\n\nDo you think I still have a chance to come out of this thing green? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI own 200 shares at 370 so I will have to sell, currently at 325ish so a 9K loss.. Assuming I do so I can do that then sell my puts and still net 125 bucks at least.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have fully embrace the autist and here I was thinking I was playing it safe.
