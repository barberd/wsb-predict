{"id": "em755t", "title": "TSLA stock crash", "selftext": "So everyone made a pretty penny on TSLA. Personally I\u2019m up 200%, about 100k just by TSLA in the past month. It is a bubble, the bubble keeps growing, however this is not the full bubble yet that\u2019s going to happen this year. \n\nHowever there is going to be a big correction, all it takes is a start of a sell off then most people will start to panic, lock in their profits and sell which will unleash a chain reaction, and the price will fall faster than it has gained. \nMost investors with gains is most likely still unrealized. All the open interest calls would make a huge loss for the writers who are the ones sitting on the insane gains with share prices - they are fine to cash out and let the call buyers burn and repeat the same process, when the price corrects. \n\nI\u2019m buying 500 puts for January 17th, my price target is a 30% decline to 350. This could happen all in one week. Afterwards we will see an insane bull run again. \nUntil the sell off, however the price could still keep going up, so I\u2019m timing this purchase. \n\nPlease note this is my own research, and my own play. Please don\u2019t listen to anyone, including me.", "created_utc": 1578560534, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/em755t/tsla_stock_crash/", "is_self": true}
