We all know the gay bears are out in full force the past two days,  I bet they must feel so smart. But guess what? There are legitimate plays to make on beer virus that don\u2019t involve betting the world will end (it won\u2019t) or stupid vaccine speculation (you really think China is gonna pay for the vaccine?? They\u2019re just gonna take that shit and make it themselves, duh). Here\u2019s the big brain play: Quarantine baby boom. I know this probably hasn\u2019t occurred to you virgins, but from what I\u2019ve been told, people tend to fuck when completely bored and locked up with nothing to do. Think about every weekend when the markets close. What do you all do when bored out of your minds? Most of you degenerates masturbate furiously at least 6 or 7 times each day. But guess what? Porn is banned in China, which means that they pretty much have to get off the old fashion way, aka with real people. We\u2019ve all heard of Hurricane babies and blackout babies, well in 9 months time, there will most certainly be millions of new quarantine babies. Think about it, hundreds of millions of Chinese people bored out of their minds, locked up with nothing to for weeks on end. Not to mention the inability to go to the store and buy condoms. There is also the [video](https://youtu.be/EBUa3WkStFg) of the apartment complex in Wuhan where you can hear what can only be described as thousands of Chinese people fucking. This is the perfect storm for  possibly the largest baby boom in modern history. \nAlright so what\u2019s the play then?\nI like P&amp;G (PG), Kimberly-Clark (KMB), Nestl\u00e9, and Mattel (MAT). The Pampers diaper brand is P&amp;G\u2019s largest brand by sales, and KMB owns the Huggies and pull up diaper brands. Mattel owns fisher prices, Barbie, hot wheels, and other shit that my parents never bought for me. There\u2019s also a bunch of other shit on the Shanghai exchange. This is by no means an exhaustive list of stocks for this play, so definitely come up with your most retarded ideas and let everyone know, so we can all lose money together. Personally looking into ways to get more exposure to the Chinese divorce industry, as we all know that children cause divorces (at least that\u2019s what my parents told me when they got divorced).\n\nTLDR: Buy PG 1/15/21 $140c, KMB 1/15/21 150c, MAT 1/21/22 12c and let tendies gestate until fully yeeted \ud83d\ude0e", "created_utc": 1582443825, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f86h6g/so_you_want_to_make_money_off_the_beer_virus_huh/", "is_self": true}
