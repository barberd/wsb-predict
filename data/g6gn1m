Swimming in debt, highly leveraged, 4 billion in liquidations in the few months.  Doesnt look good right?  Its valuation has tanked to reflect these solvency issues.  \nHOWEVER, it has a 8% senior debt note maturing in 2042 that trades under the ticker MFO.  This is down only 20%  from it's high.  Granted, this gets priority in liquidation, but there should be an increased risk in the debt that should cause a loss of value.  \n\nBasically what it looks like is the debt is trading like everything is fine while the underlying REIT has became a penny stock.  Seems like there should be a convergence play here... anyone know something I'm missing? \nI will freely admit I dont know enough about cointegration trading or REIT bankruptcy to make a play, but it looks like a killer opportunity on the surface.  10% finders fee on gains seems fair right?", "created_utc": 1587617954.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6gn1m/convergence_play_for_those_that_know_more_than_me/", "is_self": true}
