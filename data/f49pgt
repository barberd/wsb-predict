{"id": "f49pgt", "title": "CHZ Thread", "selftext": "Chiliz is a digital currency that fuels sports and entertainment platforms. From football, to soccer, to crickets, to esports. Just imagine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is estimated that more than half of the world's population consider themselves to be association football (soccer) fans. The sport enjoys an estimated 4.0 billion person following, and a global sphere of influence. Considered this, CHZ is going to be the most \"normie\" crypto-related thing out there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe best part is the apps tied into the exchange order book putting direct buying pressure on it without allowing to move the tokens off the app, so NO SELLING PRESSURE. Moreover it's easy to use for people not familiar with cryptocurrencies. It'll be like in app transactions. They have done everything right. Buy your stack and just sit back watching it take off.", "created_utc": 1581775004, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f49pgt/chz_thread/", "is_self": true}
