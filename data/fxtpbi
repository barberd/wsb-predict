{"id": "fxtpbi", "title": "Summary of DD from 4/7-4/8, plays and TLDR included", "selftext": " Welcome back to the WSB DD Summary! This is for 4/7-4/8. I\u2019m your host and resident autist u/expander2. You have to be able to read to gain anything from this so that rules out about half of you. As always, this is organized from most important at the top to least important at the bottom. A TLDR, plays, and previous DD summaries will be at the bottom. My last posts still stand and hold some good info so check it out for more plays if this isn't enough for you greedy fucks.\n\nDISCLAIMER; I am not personally advocating for any play that I add to this list. I merely go through a couple of days of posts and find what I think is competent DD. PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK.\n\nThis market is unprecedented. Everyone is unsure right now. Puts, calls, shares, who the fuck knows? The one thing that I am sure of is that we are not done. Many things are priced in already, that's why options are so fucking expensive right now.[ We all think](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fwdmda/do_those_options_you_are_looking_to_buy_seem/) the market is gonna have some crazy swings so we want to bet on those swings. The IV is crazy and is gonna stay like that until either Beer Flu is contained or the Fed throws in the towel and lets us collapse. As the spread evens out a little bit in the coming days we have to make informed decisions about what we are gonna buy and why. Reading two sentences about some random ticker you've never heard about is not enough to make an informed decision. So that brings me to my point;\n\nANOTHER DROP IS COMING. It may not be in a week though. I am of the belief that there will be one or two days where we drop a lot then it'll be a steady decline until jobs come back and WuFlu is dead. The V-shaped recovery that the Trump Administration is preaching can not happen when millions of people are unemployed. It's just not possible. The US is not gonna be good. Sure social media is all talking about how they are inside but if you've been out of your house in the last week then you know that no one is taking this quarantine seriously. Keep in mind though that cases were priced in. A recession because of job loss, company failure, and market collapse is not priced in. The market WILL GO DOWN. It's just a matter of when. To combat this time scale you have to buy puts or calls months out. This short shit is tough to call.[ This poster](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fx9y9b/im_down_550k_on_my_puts_heres_why_im_not_worried/) goes into great detail about why we are going down and why he isn't worried about the loss he has suffered because of these green days.[ Europe still](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fwkwf7/france_has_not_yet_reached_the_peak_of_the/) hasn't hit peak infections and will not for a while just like us (Spain (EWP) and France (EWQ) anyone?). The[ overwhelming consensus](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fwmcjf/the_drop_is_coming_but_it_may_be_further_out_than/) is that we are not done falling.\n\nNow to plays; Mr. Fuzzy Blankeet did[ another stock analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fx6b0t/playtimes_over_fuzzy_does_db/) this time on Dave and Busters (PLAY). There are using a risky strategy to get their debt paid on time. This can be an ideal time to invest given the drop across the board. They are not making revenue right now and they released a statement recently stating that they have no idea when they will start making money again because they can't predict the economic and social impact of the virus. They are in negotiations to handle their leases and talking with investors to handle their debt. They have 18 months to get almost $800 million together to pay off their debts so they are looking to do a PIPE (public investment in private equity) which, as said earlier, is risky. Short term; expect a drop especially when earnings come out. Long term; they will probably go up. Watch the news and if they find an investor to get the debt paid that'll make their price jump.\n\nHonestly, there hasn't been much good DD in the last few days with the coup in the mod booth and all. The only other one I have is[ this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fx75y3/evercore_evr_will_moon_over_the_next_6_months/) about Evercore (EVR) where OP said it was gonna moon. they are an investment bank that has some decent numbers relative to their competitors. OP says up, I say watch it but it's not a huge deal. If you have money to spend buy a call. If you don't then don't waste your money on this.\n\nThat's it for today, just want to say congrats to the mods for the revolution. I'm glad you guys are getting this place under control.\n\nGood luck fuckers and tune in on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for more WSB DD Summaries!\n\nTLDR; Drop coming probably over a long period of time, options are expensive so watch IV and don't fuck yourself with stupid moves, Dave and Busters could be fun to play, we need more DD that is actually decent here.\n\nPlays; Possibly puts on EWQ and EWP, Short term puts and long term calls on PLAY, maybe check out EVR but take it with a grain of salt.\n\nPrevious WSB DD Summaries;[ 3/26-3/27](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fq231l/wsb_dd_summary_326327_plays_and_tldr_included/),[ 3/28-3/30](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fruu30/i_compiled_dd_from_the_last_few_days_for_you/),[ 4/3-4/6](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fw4nmv/wsb_dd_summary_4346_i_hope_you_fucks_can_read/)", "created_utc": 1586443683.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxtpbi/summary_of_dd_from_4748_plays_and_tldr_included/", "is_self": true}
