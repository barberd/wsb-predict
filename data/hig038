PRPL 22.5c 8/21 if you really need a strike.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI decided to appeal to both WSB audiences today with two different types of DD:\n\n1. A completely irrelevant story with some pictures and a position\n2. Numbers and Other Stuff\n\n# I bought six Purple Mattresses today.\n\nYep.   I moved to Utah a few weeks ago (absolutely true) in order to do better DD for you in Purple's hometown (not true at all), so I decided to trek down to the Purple Factory Outlet to scope out the scene.\n\n[Purple Factory Outlet in a crappy part of Salt Lake - Sign on the door says \\\\\"NO CASH INSIDE\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/vfd2b5jfly751.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ae16530d484ec055da51702b70daf2e19e4b3964)\n\nFamily informed me they were coming to visit in three days (who does that to someone when they just moved!?!).  My wife said we needed sleeping arrangements, so I said Purple mattresses.\n\nAfter speaking with my Mattress Firm friend, he told me that Mattress Firm is entirely out of stock of twin mattresses in the Salt Lake City market (Purple's hometown).  Worse, the mattresses aren't coming back as the original (the only mattress to come in twin) is being discontinued.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qd4u5bo3oy751.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=3417ffb0eca481dbd797b67be2cb9c06c7a58a65\n\nThis is a screenshot of an internal Mattress Firm memo on the discontinuance of the Original Purple Mattress (the cheapest one by far)  What can I say?   He isn't a photographer.\n\n* The original is going away\n* Floor models are NOT to be sold as they are traffic drivers\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tsevapzpoy751.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=04399eff4e38e98ad17fa55d6db0e511f799bc67\n\nI figured the Purple branded store would have stock, if it existed.   And because they are being discontinued, I didn't want to be left short-handed in the future.  So, I walked out of the store with six Purple mattresses.  And some pillows.   And sheets.   And mattress protectors.   Aaaaaand because I took delivery, it counts towards Q2 revenue (the best part).\n\nFor all of those who will inevitably accuse me of pumping the stock, I admit that purchasing six mattresses will pump revenue and therefore pump the stock after earnings.  Now, where are all of those people who asked me for a free mattress?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[This was a sign.](https://preview.redd.it/cb3zutbvoy751.jpg?width=513&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c41c885d86d9bbe0806f5e103e5aa197dde80bb3)\n\nMost importantly, when I pulled out of the parking lot, a purple Dodge Challenger zoomed right by me.   I was barely able to get this zoomed in picture of it.   This means PRPL stock is going to zoom up.\n\nPRPL 22.5c 8/21.   I bought ten of those contracts today too.   It was cheaper than the mattresses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Numbers and Other Stuff\n\nI put forward that because Purple is a high revenue growth company, the best valuation metrics are revenue multiples (as opposed to EBITDA multiples or P/E ratios).   You're welcome to debate this, but frankly, the forward looking EBITDA and Earnings look beautiful as well.\n\nAdditionally, I put forward that Enterprise Value / Revenue is superior to Market Cap / Revenue, but I'll let you do that research yourself.\n\nFrom Yahoo Finance:\n\n**Enterprice Value / Revenue**\n\n|Ticker|As of 6/28/20|2020 Q1|2019 Q4|2019 Q3|2019 Q2|2019 Q1|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|PRPL|2.01|2.52|3.94|3.61|3.73|3.09|\n|TPX|1.71|4.84|7.39|7.34|8.07|6.88|\n|SNBR|0.98|2.36|4.40|3.79|4.97|3.78|\n|CSPR|0.53|0.91|||||\n\nYes, COVID has happened, but unlike TPX, SNBR or Serta Simmons Bedding (which [just completed](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/serta-simmons-bedding-closes-previously-announced-deleveraging-and-liquidity-enhancing-transaction-301081152.html) a [pseudo-bankruptcy](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/serta-simmons-bedding-enters-into-agreement-with-majority-of-lenders-on-deleveraging-and-liquidity-enhancing-transaction-301072368.html)), Purple has actually benefited from COVID and its prospects have never looked better with a shift to higher revenue- and margin-per-unit DTC as well as insatiable demand from its wholesale partners.\n\nPRPL is currently trading well below its own previous EV / Rev multiple range, ***despite accelerating revenue growth into Q2*** with a healthy long-term outlook of holding an increase.\n\nAdditionally, PRPL is trading ***well below*** the pre-COVID norm for industry EV / Rev mutliples.\n\nWhat about CSPR?   CSPR is a total dumpster fire that is now drowning in IPO lawsuits.  Its revenue growth has materially slowed, was awful in April forward looking (15% YoY growth vs 170% for PRPL), on declining margins.  The cash burn rate for CSPR was high before COVID.  They likely only have a few quarters left to live.   I think they are overpriced as a result.   CSPR is a bad comp even though there are similarities to the businesses at the 30,000 ft level.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Revenue Growth & Estimates (Q2 Estimates via Yahoo Finance)**\n\n|Ticker|My Estimate|Q2 Low-Mid-High Estimates||2020 Q1|2019 Q4|2019 Q3|2019 Q2|2019 Q1|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|PRPL|201.7-233.3|170-180.1-186.9|Actuals|122.4|124.3|117.4|103.0|83.6|\n||||YoY %|46.3%|58.3%|65.8%|36.0%|37.7%|\n|TPX||613-616.4-626.4|Actuals|822.4|871.3|821.0|722.8|690.9|\n||||YoY %|19.0%|32.9%|12.5%|7.9%|6.6%|\n|SNBR||176.8-216.4-281.4|Actuals|472.6|441.2|474.8|356.0|426.4|\n||||YoY %|10.8%|7.1%|14.5%|12.6%|9.7%|\n|CSPR||95.8-104.8-113.6|Actuals|113.0|126.9|||89.4|\n||||YoY %|26.4%|24.3%\\*|24.3%\\*|24.3%\\*||\n\nA few items of note here:\n\n* CSPR disclosed the Last Twelve Months YoY growth as of 3/31 was 24.3% (which sucks for a revenue growth company that is burning cash)\n* PRPL accelerated its growth over the past year.   It is massively accelerating again in Q2.\n* PRPL disclosed in an 8k that is has already booked about $145M in revenue for Q2, so the analysts' consensus estimates are WAY under.  I gave my math and [estimate for Q2 sales here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gzm5y9/prpl_8k_sales_release/).   I still stand by the estimate that PRPL will beat $200M in revenue this quarter, especially since I just bought six mattresses.\n* Now compare the barely double digit growth numbers of TPX & SNBR over the past year to PRPL.   Now compare the EV / R multiples.   Something is off.\n* PRPL may very well beat SNBR in revenue for Q2 (due to SNBR's high reliance on wholesale sales).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Summary:**  PRPL's EV / R multiple is under where is should be, even in this market, whether you compare it to its own previous multiples or its competitors before they were affected by COVID.   If you look at COVID EV / R multiples, it is ***in-line*** with companies who are materially struggling with cash flow and growth... this couldn't be further from the truth.   PRPL is undervalued.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Analyst Price Targets\n\nI don't usually give these guys much weight, but for those of you who do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h13nnc7zxy751.png?width=531&format=png&auto=webp&s=f36406c5e43cd7e07757ba6459dbff5665b7e525\n\nMarketbeat (and a few others) are inaccurately showing a lower consensus price target because they are using some very old price targets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qxgstjh4yy751.png?width=1359&format=png&auto=webp&s=af9d185d18ad3db9c3bc8f44c6acecc729cc6d1a\n\nAs you look at the 7 price targets MarketBeat is using to build a consensus price target, two of them are from last year, which is ridiculously old (it's about time you update this Bank of America--you got your underwriting--now do your job).  Wedbush was after earnings, but before the recent 8-K on Q2 revenue.\n\nI put forward that the only targets that matter are those that adjusted to the 8-K revenue announcement.   The consensus there is $19.75.   This only matters if you follow these types of things.\n\n# Today's Price Action\n\nI admit that this post would have been more relevant early this morning when I started writing it (the numbers part).\n\nThe price spiked late afternoon because of the attention drawn to it by a CNBC interview by CEO Joe Megibow.\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/06/29/purple-ceo-on-the-popularity-of-mattresses-as-americans-stay-at-home.html](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/06/29/purple-ceo-on-the-popularity-of-mattresses-as-americans-stay-at-home.html)\n\nIn the interview, he doesn't share anything really new (for those of us who closely follow), but he does emphasize that PRPL doesn't have a return rate problem, unlike others (\\*cough\\* CSPR \\*cough\\*).\n\n# Q2 EPS / EBITDA Estimates\n\nPRPL has generated $70M in cash during April and May, which is insane for a stock that has generated Adjusted EBITDA in the 6.2-15.3M range over the last four quarters.   The quarter isn't even done yet.\n\nI'm not putting an EPS estimate on this because the amazing cash generation is going to be partially offset by a fairly large warrant liability expense adjustment.   It will likely be one of the final expense adjustments we see as the secondary offering triggered a strike price drop to zero, which is one of key things the liability expense was modelling.  Regardless, warrant liability expense doesn't deserve to be an expense as the warrants themselves are already built into fully diluted EPS, which is what everyone reports.   The FASB done messed up on this one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Technical Astrology & PRPL Patterns\n\nIMO, most technical analysis is confirmation bias at best.   Here's some confirmation bias.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5kviazrs0z751.png?width=1166&format=png&auto=webp&s=56c8daaa52c4af31c66c9821e57e40b9362b1bcd\n\nIf you are into this type of thing, PRPL has been a series of Bull Flags since the bottom of COVID.   We are now ending our fourth bull flag (which likely ended today).   At least this is what stocktwits and a few other areas are raving about.\n\n**Intraday Patterns**\n\nThe intraday patterns are more interesting to me.   I've been watching this security fairly closely over the last 3 months since the COVID bottom, and on most days, you'll see a spike in the morning that fades away into the afternoon.   It is almost like clockwork and seems to be irrespective of volume.\n\nWhile I don't trade this pattern because I don't want to exit my long-term capital gains positions yet, some of PRPL gang makes money by buying in the morning (or afternoon before), selling/shorting at the peak, and then closing/buying late afternoon.   Good on them!\n\nAlso, PRPLW warrants tend to lag the stock on the way up if you want to play that too.\n\n# What is your next play after PRPL?\n\nI've already mentioned several times that I will fully exit my warrants (and rotate into some PRPL stock / long dated options) when the stock price reaches about $24.   My inbox has been bombarded with questions about what my next play is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t56ziwe42z751.png?width=1161&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ccef0051c2f1740d1c8059f1cb2a16188f7435c\n\nThe above chart is a comparison between CSPR and PRPL.   CSPR, even though it is a total dog, has been riding up with PRPL on sympathy plays.   CSPR spikes on PRPL news, conference presentations, and any other movement.\n\nPRPL has reasons to be up.   CSPR shouldn't be any higher than where it was after its last earnings release.   The only new things that have occurred are dozens of IPO lawsuits.\n\nI'll be shorting CSPR for somewhere between $100k-$500k if I end up exiting my PRPL positions before CSPR earnings and if this stupid pattern holds.   It's free money.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Positions\n\nI've got tons of warrants (closing in on $2M worth) and now 10x PRPL 22.5c 8/21.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo your own due diligence.
