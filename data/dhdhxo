Apple directly supplied us buying power, 2 months before the iPhone 11 launch date. And people swarmed to Apple stores, putting their iPhone 11 purchase on their Apple Credit Card tab. \n\nThe point? Apple is genius. Obviously buy Apple now or wait for a dip. I wrote research papers on how Apple avoided taxes, and let me tell you, they do everything with intensity and creativity. \n\n**Timing**\n\niPhone 11 launched on September 20th, 2019. \n\nApple Card launched on [August 20, 2019](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/08/apple-card-launches-today-for-all-us-customers/), exactly two months before you could buy the new iPhone. \n\n**Easy credit**\n\nIt was incredibly easy to get a $7,000 limit with Apple Credit. Incredibly. Yes, it's easier to get credit limits these days, but still. Most people are poor, and it was incredibly easy to get a buying power of someone with a $100,000 yearly salary. \n\nPeople literally bought their iPhone 11  with their iPhone X, using Apple Credit Card.", "created_utc": 1570987401, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dhdhxo/apple_dd_giving_you_money_to_buy_its_stuff/", "is_self": true}
