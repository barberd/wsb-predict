{"id": "fh4785", "title": "ARMK - Sports Closures", "selftext": "While Aramark was down 14% today - this was prior to the news of March Madness being played in front of no fans. Additionally, we can expect more stadium / sporting closures due in the near feature. This company is sure to get rocked by the fall out. Food and Support Services represent 70% of revenues, company is operating at a net loss, and the balance sheet is weak with low cash and high debt.\n\n*NOTE:* As mentioned by commenters, volume is extremely low so you will have to scan the options chain for reasonably priced options.\n\n**Business Description:**\n\nAramark provides food, facilities, and uniform services to education, healthcare, business and industry, sports, leisure, and corrections clients in North America and internationally. It operates through three segments: Food and Support Services United States, Food and Support Services International, and Uniform and Career Apparel. The company offers managed services, including dining, catering, food service management, and convenience-oriented retail operations; non-clinical support services, such as patient food and nutrition, retail food, and procurement services; and plant operations and maintenance, custodial/housekeeping, energy management, grounds keeping, and capital project management services. It also provides on-site restaurants, catering, convenience stores, and executive dining services; beverage and vending services; and facility management services comprising landscaping, transportation, payment, and other facility consulting services relating to building operations. In addition, the company offers concessions, banquet, and catering services; retail services and merchandise sale, recreational, and lodging services; and facility management services at sports, entertainment, and recreational facilities. Further, the company offers correctional food, and food and facilities management services for parks; and operates commissaries, laundry facilities, and property rooms.\n\n**Risk Factors - Directly From 10-K**\n\n**Economic Downturn**\n\nThe portion of our food and support services business that provides services in public facilities such as convention centers and tourist and recreational attractions is particularly sensitive to an economic downturn, as expenditures to take vacations or hold or attend conventions are funded to a partial or total extent by discretionary income. A decrease in such discretionary income on the part of potential attendees at our clients' facilities has in the past resulted, and in the future could result, in a reduction in our revenue. Further, because our exposure to the ultimate consumer of what we provide is limited by our dependence on our clients to attract those consumers to their facilities and events, our ability to respond to such a reduction in attendance, and therefore our revenue, is limited. There are many factors that could reduce the numbers of events in a facility or attendance at an event, including labor disruptions involving sports leagues, poor performance by the teams playing in a facility, number of playoff games, inclement weather and adverse economic conditions which would adversely affect revenue and profits.\n\n**Natural Disasters:**\n\nNatural disasters, global calamities, political unrest, sports strikes and other adverse incidents could adversely affect our revenue and operating results. Natural disasters, including hurricanes and earthquakes, global calamities, such as an Ebola outbreak or a flu pandemic, or political unrest, such as the recent demonstrations in Chile, have, and in the future could, affect our revenue and operating results. In the past, we experienced lost and closed client locations, business disruptions and delays, the loss of inventory and other assets, asset impairments and the effect of the temporary conversion of a number of our client locations to provide food and shelter to those left homeless by storms. For example, our financial results were particularly impacted in 2018 by wildfires in and around Yosemite National Park and in 2017 by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico and Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in the southern United States. In addition, any terrorist attacks, particularly against venues that we serve, and the national and global military, diplomatic and financial response to such attacks or other threats, also may adversely affect our revenue and operating results. Sports strikes, particularly those that persist for an extended time period, can reduce our revenue and have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Any decrease in the number of games played would mean a loss of revenue and reduced profits at the venues we service.\n\n**TLDR:** The company provides food and support services to convention centers, conferences, and stadiums which accounts for 70% of revenues. The company has directly cited pandemics and economic downturns as risk factors in their 10-K, however, they have never experienced mass closures around the country of public events.
