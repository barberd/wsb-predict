{"id": "gmrv3j", "title": "Why HPQ is on my watchlist for next week's earnings", "selftext": "## Why read this and *not* skip to the tldr?\n\nSo I'm the guy who's been putting up weekly DD for a few weeks now based on earning plays I've bought into. These were my last three: [One](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9na5t/why_mtch_will_be_your_next_1000_play/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=wallstreetbets&utm_content=t3_gf9cr0), [Two](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gf9cr0/your_next_earning_play_for_big_gains_sdc_tldr/), [Three](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gignio/two_big_earnings_plays_for_maximum_tendies_rcl/). These three posts included 4 plays, $MTCH, $SDC, $RCL, and $PLT. 3 out of 4 of these would have netted you 200-500% profit, while $PLT was a break even play due to bad timing (market crashed for two days after I had posted/bought in, price dropping unrelated to the actual company itself). So with a decent track record, I wanted to just discuss my next earning play. \n\n## Intro, Lets Talk Tech\n\nSo during the coronavirus lockdown, you'd think sales would be pretty low in this space? Well yea... with that, all stocks dropped in value but many have rebounded. The market crashed, *recession, remember?* Focusing on tech stocks alone, consider the pre-covid19 price compared to now, many companies in this sector have successfully rebounded from the market's crash and have achieved new highs. Consider LOGI's [6-month chart](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/logi) sitting nicely at ATH or even [AAPL](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/aapl) which is getting there. Tech stocks have done extremely well in the last month and a half or so. All tech stocks have also had a very good earnings run-up prior to their earnings report. But you probably don't want to buy calls for a stock that's at or above it's pre-covid19 levels. We're also looking for stocks that have a bit of time before they release their earnings so we can play the run-up. So let me show you [HPQ](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/hpq). \n\n## HP Inc. (HPQ) \n\nAs you guys know, HP is a tech company that sells laptops, printers and other related products. Earnings is on [May 27th, 4:05 pm](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/hpq). I want you guys to directly compare it's 6-month chart to other tech companies: https://i.imgur.com/QkEkdrp.png\n\nNote how HPQ didn't quite have the recovery that all the other examples show? This allows for a lot of room to play the earnings run-up. As mentioned, tech companies have done extremely well, so with the stock currently sitting at $16.60ish I expect HPQ to easily hit $17.50. Possibly run as high as $18. Most investors will also be considering the increase in sales that have happened in the latter half of the lockdown due to people having to buy laptops and peripherals or upgrade to work from home. Also, on [Friday HP declared a $0.1762/share quarterly dividend, a forward yield of 4.74%](https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/HP+Inc.+%28HPQ%29+Declares+%240.1762+Quarterly+Dividend%3B+4.8%25+Yield/16893847.html), but you would need to buy in before June 9th to get in on this. Because of this, we should see an extra load of people buying shares for earnings run-up this week *and to* capture the dividend before selling (if they sell at all). It's also worth noting that there was a high chance HP Inc [was going to be bought out by Xerox at $24/share](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/03/02/hp-reviewing-24-per-share-offer-from-xerox.html), but the deal was canceled over covid19. It's probable that the offer will be put forth again, which would be absolutely amazing for long-term shareholders. People reeling from covid19 crash should consider this a great buy, especially now, right before earnings. All of this just adds to the growing list of reasons to get calls as soon as possible. \n\n## Big Moves\n\nThere have been a lot of Hedge fund activity regarding HPQ lately, including Baupost hedge fund doubled stake in HPQ to 2 million shares. As for unusual options activity: on Friday, [there was a 5x increase in daily call purchases](https://www.americanbankingnews.com/2020/05/15/hp-sees-unusually-high-options-volume-nysehpq.html), meaning investors are anticipating a possible strong move in the share price leading up to earnings. Strong activity especially at the 17, 17.5 and 18c. \n\n## What I'm Doing\n\nI've already bought 15c last week and [talked about this play 3 days ago on my profile](https://www.reddit.com/user/AveenoFresh/comments/gkedb5/so_this_is_my_next_earning_play_dd_will_be_posted/). I'm considering double dipping and getting more, but not now. Hence the title, that this ticker is on my *watchlist*. I'll probably buy in on the next dip, possibly something not so ITM. Should you get 15c too? Nah. Someone just wanting to play the run up and snatch some quick gains before selling prior to earnings and risk a lot less capital in a run up to earnings should go for $16.5c 5/29. The 6/5 exp date contracts are worth looking at too. Yes, it\u2019s a week after earnings, but HPQ should gain through earnings, possibly spike after, dip some, and then hold those gains in a run towards the dividend release I mentioned earlier for 6/9. The 6/5 contract gives an extra week of protection for market volatility and for the shares to come back for anyone ballsy enough to hold through earnings and try to capture further buying from dividend seekers. \n\nShares are currently at the high 16s with 6 trading days until earnings report after hours. You guys should be careful of market volatility as it interfered with my PLT buy from last week. My price target in a run up to earnings is $18/share. If earnings are good as expected then there will be a slight bump AH and maybe a little selling for profit taking the day after, but a lot of investors will hold shares through that special June 9th date and the shares may even increase more from there.\n\nIf you do buy into this play, I'm suggesting most hold til the day of earnings and those will brass balls who really want to gamble can hold through earnings. Time value will be a major factor with these options expiring just two days after earnings. \n\n**tldr** Put this stock on your watchlist, buy on the next dip. I'm looking at $16.5c 5/29 and $17.5c 6/9.
