Anyone who knows AdSense knows they NEVER lift bans... EVER.... for pretty much ANY reason... much less 6+ years later for no reason.\n\nThey are BEYOND hurting for revenue if they're opening back up banned AdSense accounts. They were banned for a reason... mostly click fraud, but in general, these accounts were flagged as posing a danger to their advertisers (either malware, spyware, click fraud, lead fraud, impression fraud, suspect or lacking content, etc). This could be a short-term boon to their revenues, but *definitely* poses a long-term danger to the rates Google can charge. Mostly though, the fact they are even taking this course of actions means they are *needing* to scrape the bottom of the barrel for every bit of revenue they can find.... even if it's less than \"legitimate\" and not good long-term for them *or* their advertisers. \n\nNot sure if this dip will be reflected in Q1, but look the fuck out come Q2...", "created_utc": 1587840709.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7yzzs/anecdotal_evidence_of_how_goog_is_doing_going/", "is_self": true}
