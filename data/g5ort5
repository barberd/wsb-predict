Around 750,000 USD at a .16 bid. \n\nIf you were wanting to buy a lotto ticket might as well be these.\n\nEdit: Theres no other BP contract with anywhere near that volume so it isn't a spread. Is this a hedge? Why would it be only at a 4/24 expiry? I'm gonna be honest I'm retarded and dont know what I'm doing so what do you guys think?", "created_utc": 1587506653.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5ort5/options_activity_421/", "is_self": true}
