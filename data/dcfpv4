{"id": "dcfpv4", "title": "Finland\u2019s Press Conference", "selftext": "Be me, elected president of a small,forward thinking Nordic nation\n\nPast couple of years have been rough, but gained international attention because of smart financial and political moves\n\nFinally in a position to interact with the big boys on a global level\n\nAwww yis, prosperity time\n\nGet invited to Washington to hammer out a deal on trade and the purchase of advanced arms\n\nAll going so well, fuck yeah I\u2019m great at this. Doing wonderful things for my people\n\nUS president has been nothing but nice and accommodating my entire stay, even giving me the edge in some parts of our agreement\n\nAsks to hold a joint press conference the final day of our talks, wants to show the world our progress\n\nUh, hell yeah dude?\n\nAt the conference, all going well. Cracking some jokes to ease the tension\n\nNothing to worry about :)\n\nHalfway through the press conference, he gets this look on his face. Ends the segment on our work, opens it up to questions.\n\nUh...alright? I guess. A little short but I guess our deal not super important anyways.\n\nSays he wants to talk about something that \u2018has been going on for quite some time\u2019\n\nOh god oh fuck please god no\n\nPulls down his trousers and undergarments in front of the entire press core, including 7 reporters from my homeland here to report exclusively on our deal\n\nHis orange, mango sized balls drop out from under him and slap the floor. Like two wet dodgeballs.\n\nHe inhales sharply\n\nStarts to scream incoherently about impeachment and evil progressives, says all US presidents (including those shot in the head for their policies) are punk ass bitch ass little bitches that would need several safe spaces to handle the amount of negative press covfefe he receives with just his little pinky\n\nHe turns around and bends over, exposing his loose orange sphincter to the front row of reporters.\n\nHe lets out a low, guttural growl that sounds almost inhuman. It quickly builds in tempo to an ear piercing shriek\n\n\u201cSSSSSSSSSSCHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHUIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF\u201d\n\nHis asshole loosens.\n\nSuddenly the front row of the press is pressure blasted by a torrent of butt fudge unleashed by the President\u2019s own backside\n\nMost are hit directly in the head. Glasses, earrings, microphones all go flying in every which direction as President Trump shreds the faces of the corrupt untouchables of his America with his bowel sludge.\n\nI stand there...only able to watch, in horror, as a journalist from Finnish MTV drowns in the bile\n\nSuddenly, a flamboyantly dressed reporter in the middle of the crowd stands up. Only half covered in shit, he asks the president in a lisp\n\n\u201cSir, what do you think about the Demo-\n\nDoesn\u2019t even finish the word before, Trump whirls around, eyes tinged with red and yellow, stares through him and into his soul\n\n\u201cFAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGOOOOOTTTTT, YOU ARE NOT STRAIGHT AND NEITHER IS THE FAKE NEWS\u201d\n\nImmediately, a panel in the wall behind us retracts into itself. A Barrett .50 Cal sniper extends out in its place.\n\nGay reporter has no time to react. His head and upper torso are instantly torn off, spraying the shit covered crowd around him with a mist of red.\n\nPeople are screaming, desperately trying to get out of the room as they slip and flounder over each other, helpless.\n\nTrump stands upright and zips his pants up. He turns to me, his eyes completely black now.\n\nDefinitelyshouldnthaveeatenthosebrowniesRandybroughtinyesterday.jpeg\n\nHe grips my arm as he pulls out two gold plated Desert Eagles from under his podium \n\nHe pulls me close and almost whispers into my ear\n\n*\u201cRemember, No Reporter\u201d*\n\n\nStarts doming members of the press left and right, dual wielding lead into the cranium of any still moving journalist\n\nAs he moves through the crowd finishing off stragglers, I see several staffers enter the room holding several realistic face masks of his most popular opponents\n\nAOC, Pelosi, and Schumer masks are thrown over the faces of the still bleeding\n\nTrump, now at the end of the room, deeply inhales the pistol\u2019s gunsmoke, and once again drops his pants. \n\nHis balls have now swollen to the size of cinder blocks\n\nHe strokes himself as he locks eyes with me and smiles\n\n\u201cThank you for being here today and hosting this wonderful, beautiful conference with me today Mr. President. I look forward to our nations\u2019 perfect future together.\u201d\n\nHe kneels down next to the closest dead body, and dips his hands into their congealed fluids.\n\nWe maintain eye contact as he smears the blood across his face\n\n\u201cThat will be all\u201d\n\nI am immediately ushered out of the East Room by Secret Service members and put on the next plane to Sweden.\n\nAt least the jet fighters were pretty cheap", "created_utc": 1570046975, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dcfpv4/finlands_press_conference/", "is_self": true}
