{"id": "gi0jq6", "title": "DD on LOW (LOWES), Earnings coming soon", "selftext": "Hello you all, before I begin my DD. I\u2019m the guy who called out TGT ( Target ) last week and look WHERE it\u2019s at now? Even the mods didn\u2019t believe me and took down the post. I hope target has earned you guys many tendies, if you want proof, look at my post history.\n\nNow to begin with the LOW dd. It will most likely get to $115-$120 by the end of this week. It\u2019s on a very strong uptrend, it also has been very stable with minimal dips throughout each day the past week. What we can see is that earnings is coming up, 5/20. The IV right now isn\u2019t that bad on the calls for 5/15 or 5/22. Surely as we get closer, I\u2019m fairly certain we will see a surge in IV and stock price based on what\u2019s going on. Keep in mind, LOWES has been packed, I always drive everyday of the week to go to work and the parking lot is packed. It\u2019s like HD, which also has earnings come up. But that\u2019s for another discussion.\nLOWES has been killing it as people have nothing else to do but work on home improvements to their home. As we also know WSB will mention this stock a lot like NET and etc. it\u2019s your best bet to get in now. Remember, you\u2019re not supposed to hold through earnings to secure your profit but SELL BEFORE. Please NOTE THIS. It\u2019s a gambling going into earnings, we all know this\n\nTDLR: LOWES Earnings 5/19, Strong uptrend with minimal dips, they been killing it, get in before WSB pumps up, look at 5/15 or 5/22, you pick your strike price and date. Thanks me later next week as I helped you guys with target last week. \n\nI hope you all make tendies and mods don\u2019t take this DD post down, as they did with my Target DD. I wish you all luck.", "created_utc": 1589244628.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gi0jq6/dd_on_low_lowes_earnings_coming_soon/", "is_self": true}
