By selecting shares at random every month.\n\n[This piece of shit is a better investor than you](https://preview.redd.it/nge45dm20cy41.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=4181db4ad3e3e52288fa5f4946161760dda845a4)\n\nIn its twentieth anniversary, Jacko achieved a positive price return of no less than 147% percent. And we don't even count dividends. By way of comparison: over the past twenty years, the Amsterdam index (AEX) has achieved a negative price return of -10%.\n\nIn fifteen of the last twenty years, Jacko 'outperformed' the index and outperformed many a professional investor. Below you will find his impressive track record and his current portfolio.\n\n**Jacko's current portfolio**\n\n|Shares|Amount|Current price|%|Value bought|Current value|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Amsterdam Commodities|2.388|18,720|\\-25,27|59.819,40|44.703,36|\n|Altice Europe NV|7.049|3,716|101.96%|12.970.16|26.194,08|\n|ASML Holding|220|282,000|\\-2,93%|63.910,00|62.040,00|\n|DSM Koninklijke|83|112,050|\\-3,86%|9.763,65|9.300,15|\n|Galapagos|107|215,200|49,44%|15.408,00|23.026,40|\n|Philips Koninklijke|633|39,490|\\-10,96%|28.073,55|24.997,17|\n|PostNL Koninklijke|4.938|1,316|\\-69,95%|21.628,44|6.498,41|\n|Vastned|215|16,880|\\-44,01%|6.482,25|3.629,20|\n|Vopak Koninklijke|207|49,300|19,75%|8.522,19|10.205,10|\n|Eurocommercial Properties|756|10,140|\\-60,67%|19.489,68|7.665,84|\n|SUBTOTAL|||||218.259,71|\n|Cash|||||10,39|\n|TOTAL|||||218.270,10|\n\n**Jacko's returns**\n\nStock market gorilla Jacko is one of the best investors in the Netherlands. In his 20 years of existence he beat the AEX index no less than fifteen times. In 2011, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2018 he unfortunately had to acknowledge his superior in the Amsterdam main index.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Year|Amsterdam index (AEX)|Jacko|Win/loss|Difference|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2019|\\+23,92%|\\+34,01%|Win|10,09%|\n|2018|\\-10,41%|\\-25,80%|Loss|15,39%|\n|2017|\\+12,71%|\\+26,46%|Win|13,75%|\n|2016|\\+10,62%|\\-1,98%|Loss|12,60%|\n|2015|\\+4,09%|\\+3,44%|Loss|0,65%|\n|2014|\\+5,64%|\\-7,53%|Loss|13,17%|\n|2013|\\+17,24%|\\+39,86%|Win|22,62%|\n|2012|\\+9,68%|\\+12,82%|Win|3,14%|\n|2011|\\-11,87%|\\-44,74%|Loss|32,87%|\n|2010|\\+5,74%|\\+10,08%|Win|4,34%|\n|2009|\\+36%|\\+67,60%|Win|31,60%|\n|2008|\\-52,20%|\\-47,90%|Win|4,30%|\n|2007|\\+4,10%|\\+5,40%|Win|1,30%|\n|2006|\\+13,40%|\\+27,90%|Win|14,50%|\n|2005|\\+26,00%|\\+40,80%|Win|14,80%|\n|2004|\\+3,10|\\+26,10|Win|23,00%|\n|2003|\\+4,60%|\\+7,70%|Win|3,10%|\n|2002|\\-36,30%|\\-17,60%|Win|18,70%|\n|2001|\\-20,50%|\\-13,90%|Win|6,60%|\n|2000|\\-5,10%|35,60%|Win|40,70%|\n\nSo not only are you retarded, you are officially more retarded than a gorilla.\n\n**Jacko's Switches**\n\nStock market gorilla Jacko randomly exchanges a share from his portfolio every month for a new share from one of Amsterdam's three main indices. These shares, too, are randomly selected. The amount released by the sale is fully invested in the new share.\n\nJacko started investing in January 2000. At that time Jacko received 75 bananas, all of which corresponded to a fund listed on the Dutch stock exchange. The first ten bananas (corresponding to shares) formed his portfolio.\n\nSince then, Jacko randomly exchanges one share from his portfolio with a new share on a monthly basis, using bananas. The completely random choice of shares is central to this. After all, there is no information about the corresponding share in the bananas.\n\nJacko's analysis and stock/banana picking in action:  [Jacko doing deep DD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xujc2TkTYrM)\n\nSource (in Dutch):  [https://www.beursgorilla.nl/portefeuille/jacko.aspx](https://www.beursgorilla.nl/portefeuille/jacko.aspx)", "created_utc": 1589288313.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/giaq4t/the_miraculous_returns_of_stock_market_gorilla/", "is_self": true}
