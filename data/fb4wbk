It looked like that would happen in week's time for a moment.\n\nThat is until JPow changed everything. The market trades off the last story. I know it makes no sense, but coronavirus story is old news and fades away in face of a 50bp (now 50%+ probability) cut that a week ago had 0% probability. \n\nEven ultra dove Bullard was cautious in his remarks. But in the end JPow came out and said the magic words - \u201cuse our tools and act as appropriate to support the economy.\u201d He didn't have to comment today, but he chose to signal it to the market. He's got market's back.\n\nThe last time it happened, it was June-19. Check out what the market did next. Even if a couple of people die in US over the weekend that won't stop this bounce. We rally into the 18 March meeting unless we have some VERY bad story around coronavirus. Perhaps something along the lines of the 20x increase in cases in 5 days that South Korea had, but in the US.\n\nI think there'll be a better time to re-short this market. Today's rally made perfect sense considering previous reactions to the Fed pledging support. But /r/wsb will as always pretend nothing has changed and REE about upcoming US epidemic. Old news. Next. \n\nIt's silly but that's how the market works. I wish that I'm wrong and we continue the collapse but I've seen JPow's power in the past.", "created_utc": 1582938661, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fb4wbk/the_first_leg_of_the_selloff_is_over_heres_why/", "is_self": true}
