{"id": "g7ig7b", "title": "NAT was just on CNBC, CEO pumping hard, Tankers will rise substantially in the coming week.", "selftext": "Most of everyone here knows and has known about the potential gain to be made through Tanker stocks due to the oil contango. Last week we was a substantial spike in the stock prices along with the news of crashing oil prices.  This spike was followed by a very slow bleed as those who saw this coming months before finally took profits and sold, along with swing traders who took profits. I believe this slow decrease in price was not due to a lack of confidence in the companies\u2019 futures but due to the aforementioned reason.\n\nNow getting on to next week. Oil prices don\u2019t seem to be showing any signs of massive recovery, although they did spike back from negative but up to still historically low prices. Demand will not be coming back anytime soon as people are jobless with nowhere to go, lockdown most likely sticking around for much longer than expected, and overall less demand across the board. This combined with the Oil contango allows tankers to charge ridiculous prices for storage. \n\nNow finally getting onto the new news as so far most of you probably knew all this. NAT CEO Herbjorn Hansson appeared on CNBC at 6pm ET today, and he was pumping like crazy. The CEO repeated \u201cwe are making a LOT of money\u201d several times along with emphasizing their focus on stockholders with their recently doubled dividends. While most of this isn\u2019t really news to many of you, this is one of the first times main stream media has covered this and should lead to a lot of the older generation to do some research and potentially sink some money into NAT. It\u2019s already up in after hours 2% and has been steadily increasing over the past month.\n\nThen again I\u2019m a retard so you probably shouldn\u2019t listen.\n\nTL;DR. NAT CEO appeared on CNBC pumping like crazy, boomers will invest causing rise", "created_utc": 1587768627.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7ig7b/nat_was_just_on_cnbc_ceo_pumping_hard_tankers/", "is_self": true}
