{"id": "dhwvu3", "title": "PCG Outlook", "selftext": "Made a bet with a buddy that PCG would not cross 18.01 by the end of February. If it hits 18.01 I give him enough to buy 100 shares. If it stays below 18.01 and February ends, he gives me 1801 and I use that to buy $1801 worth of PCG shares. In actuality I\u2019ll probably use that on FDs and lose it all, but don\u2019t tell him. \n\nWhat say you? What do you think will happen to PCG between now and then?", "created_utc": 1571086306, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dhwvu3/pcg_outlook/", "is_self": true}
