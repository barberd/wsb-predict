{"id": "bvc09d", "title": "(AMA) sort of.. So I met with a CPA an he liked my options trading so much he invited me in to sit an make trade/Ask questions about his trades with him !", "selftext": "So I\u2019m only 22 I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s why he took such an interest in my trading but I\u2019ve learned most of it from watching your guys winnings / mistakes ! So in return I figured any questions you guys have to ask I will write down and ask my cpa on a recorded conversation to post here later on this week after our meeting ! Besides questions is there anything you guys can recommend for me to prepare ? \n\n\nThis guy had a 3million$ trading account that he opened up an made a few trades in front of me last time I was in, so I want to be as prepared as I possibly can when it comes to questions or just overall trading options. He mainly sell/writes options which I have never had the balls to do. So any info from you guy would be greatly appreciated!", "created_utc": 1559331949, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bvc09d/ama_sort_of_so_i_met_with_a_cpa_an_he_liked_my/", "is_self": true}
