{"id": "bupuqg", "title": "\u201cFree\u201d Commissions", "selftext": "Okay folks, I started using Robinhood a couple of months ago and noticed there is no such thing as free commissions (Ik im slow to realize this just know). Anyways, basically what happens is when I want to sell something, RH sells it lower and always buys it higher. Ik I should just use limits but since I trade, I want to get out as quick as possible and even when I put a limit at the exact price, it never gets filled, unless the limit is higher when I\u2019m trying to buy or lower when I\u2019m trying to sell. Wanted to hear what you guys think and your experience with RH and whether it\u2019s worth it? Thanks and good luck", "created_utc": 1559197959, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bupuqg/free_commissions/", "is_self": true}
