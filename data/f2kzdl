{"id": "f2kzdl", "title": "How to buy stock in Harry Potter", "selftext": "Sorry, I'm new here and cousin told me this is the sub to ask people about more speculative trades so I am skipping /r/investments\n\nMy broker (TD America Trade) misunderstood me and gave me Hewllet Packard shares back in 2015 when I told them to buy shares of HP.  I found out today (after 4 years) that it was a mistake and it's up about 100% but I'm angry at the same time because I know I would have made a lot more money if it was Harry Potter.\n\n I've been a Harry Potter fan since childhood and I continue to believe the series will sell a lot of books and movies for many years to come.  Perhaps even remakes.  Also I saw the HP books have sold more than the Holy Bible itself (wow).\n\nAnyway as the title says how do I buy stocks in Harry Potter, and maybe I need to find a different broker if TD America Trade doesn't sell it?", "created_utc": 1581479324, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f2kzdl/how_to_buy_stock_in_harry_potter/", "is_self": true}
