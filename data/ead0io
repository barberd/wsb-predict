{"id": "ead0io", "title": "If you're going to YOLO FDs why not buy them with expirations at least 1 year out?", "selftext": "Hear me out WSB, I know everyone here loves losing their tendies, but for 5 minutes let's all pretend we're not autistic.\n\nWhat if we bought FDs with expirations far out and 1 month before ER? That way IV is low and so is the price of the option? \n\nThe price of FDs is still going up if you're right. If you're wrong, you still have 1 year or more to be right.\n\nHere's a Practical Example:\n\nSay you wanted to buy AMD call FDs because of our savior Lisa Su. Now, you don't wait days before AMD's Q4 ER to come out to buy your FDs. And not only that, you bought them when IV is really low so the price was cheap anyway. Let's say you bought calls today with an expiry of 1/15/2021.\n\nA month goes by Q4 ER comes out and you get screwed by #beargang. But in this case it would only be temporary. You still have 3 more ERs to go to be right and collect your tendies. \n\n\\#Thetagang would not be able to fuck you like usual because you've become the long dick of the market.\n\nTLDR: AMD and ENPH calls can only go up - by 2021", "created_utc": 1576285703, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ead0io/if_youre_going_to_yolo_fds_why_not_buy_them_with/", "is_self": true}
