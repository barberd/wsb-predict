When that didn't happen, I took my loss and sold them all right before close.  Somehow, I was able to sell 5x $260 when I only owned 4.  This is odd because RH will not allow you to do that unless you own 100*number of contracts of shares.  Maybe someone smarter or dumber than me can explain what happened?~~\n\n~~Here's my history on SPY for those options:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/4U1dgUE.png~~\n\nEDIT:\nOk so actually I'm an idiot, but robinhood still sucks. Turns out if you have an order partially filled, then cancel it, it won't show on the history as being partially filled, just cancelled unless you click on it to open up the details.\n\nI'm leaving this up to help other morons in the future if they are wondering how robinhood sold more options than they own: https://i.imgur.com/dAKK4WX.png", "created_utc": 1584736194.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fm254i/bought_4_spy_260_calls_prior_the_nothingwitcher/", "is_self": true}
