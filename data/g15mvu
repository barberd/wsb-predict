{"id": "g15mvu", "title": "Why nothing matters right now", "selftext": "It seems to me that whether you are a bank that reports earnings down 70%, a rideshare company that will be going on 3 months with no customers, or a retailer that has 0 customers coming into your stores, your actual business model and how much it has been hurt does not matter as of the last few weeks. Maybe it did when the market took a big hit in mid-March, but now, everyone is going up, whether it makes sense or not.\n\nWhat we got today with JPM was a validation that even when a hypothesis of how much a business can be hurt is confirmed by it's earnings, that doesn't matter. Some dickhead from Morgan Stanley this morning on CNBC said \"investors are pretty much just writing off 2020.\" Really? So earnings don't matter at all? The balance sheet damage that 2020 will cause doesn't matter at all? The truth is, no one is doing technical analysis to backup their investments. I wish these assholes would just admit that their entire premise and returns over the last few weeks were driven by the fed and Uncle Sam throwing them a lifeboat (and driving down interest rates so much that there's nowhere besides the stock market for money to go).\n\nBack to why nothing matters for now....It seems to me like everyone is getting a hall pass because \"we are going to open again soon.\" All the math nerds and economists saying growth will be down by this % or unemployment will get up to that %, it doesn't matter. All that seems to matter is that this will be over soon. That 1 variable seems to be all this comes down to: we are going to open back up. \n\nHowever, when we do re-open, there are a few potential outcomes: 1. Things go well, coronavirus doesn't spread again, economy turns around. 2. Things go poorly, the disease spreads again, and we reset. 3. Disease spread isn't an issue, but consumers are cautious, and spending habits take a long time to get back to normal.\n\nWhat I believe will happen before this is that pretty much every state with big cities (and Democratic governors) will push back on Trump when he says to re-open. CEOs of large companies (especially in tech) will tell employees to stay home longer. \n\nAs a \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b, I just have a hard time believing re-opening will go smoothly. And if you're a restaurant or a retailer and you re-open, but no one shows up, you're actually worse off than you'd be if you just remained close. Either pushing back the open or letting it happen and fail will move the market downward.\n\nSo until the opening date is announced, pushed back, and when the opening succeeds or fails, I think we'll keep seeing crazy things in the market. I'm betting on that re-open failing or turning into a political debacle. From a consumer standpoint, we are nowhere near ready for the mass testing, therapies, etc. that will drive a successful open and/or give people confidence to go out in public. \n\nCurrently 5/1 SPY and Uber puts, will likely push out expiration.
