{"id": "e1bgif", "title": "buy $SAVA", "selftext": "Yo Cassava is a pharma company that focuses on treating Alzheimer's. Its current small-molecule candidate has shown that it can significantly reduce amyloid and tau buildup in the brain in animal models, which shows that this therapy could very well be a candidate for reducing the progression of Alzheimer's in patients. It will be presenting its phase 2a results on December 5th at CTAD. It is important to note that Cassava voluntarily submitted an abstract to CTAD and this data wasn't technically due. This shows that they're probably really happy with the data and wanna breathe some life into their stock, which has been beaten down quite a bit. Given how small the market cap is (22 million...), any news that can be potentially good can cause a huge spike in this one. You unfortunately can't trade options on this, but I bet even buying some shares could provide a 100% gain since the market cap is super small. Look at how KRTX behaved after its phase two studies were revealed. I'm probably gonna buy some shares, sell some before December 5th since there's probably gonna be more people buying in the upcoming trading days, and then save some shares for the December 5th meeting. The market cap is super small so I feel like it can only go up.", "created_utc": 1574660084, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e1bgif/buy_sava/", "is_self": true}
