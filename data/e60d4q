Then 100 people chime in NO YOU DO IT, and the first guys like I\"M NOT DOING IT.\n\nI present to you $STONKS, an ETF of the shit you talk about too much. \n\n* Data was gathered using the pushshift reddit API\n* 25 most mentioned stocks (referenced against Russell 1000) are included in the ETF\n* Weighted by mention count\n* Excluded a large number of symbols that are words (A, IT, ON, ARE, MAN, HE, etc.)\n* FDS has been included because it seemed awful not to\n* BRO was actually pretty highly ranked and while I wanted to keep it in the weighting was pretty disproportionate. Also I liked the idea of two $BECKY stocks being part of the $TONKS fund. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Symbol|Weight|Mentions|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|AMD|13%|32945|\n|TSLA|8%|18766|\n|DIS|6%|15950|\n|MSFT|6%|15834|\n|BYND|6%|13991|\n|AAPL|6%|13866|\n|MU|5%|11436|\n|AMZN|4%|10936|\n|FDS|4%|10191|\n|V|4%|9962|\n|BA|4%|9133|\n|FB|4%|9030|\n|UBER|3%|8159|\n|NFLX|3%|7663|\n|ATH|3%|6968|\n|NVDA|3%|6896|\n|LYFT|3%|6614|\n|C|2%|5735|\n|GE|2%|5672|\n|SQ|2%|5669|\n|EA|2%|5191|\n|ATVI|2%|4674|\n|MCD|2%|4570|\n|LULU|2%|4417|\n|SBUX|2%|4162|", "created_utc": 1575471304, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e60d4q/wsb_etf_tonks_a_look_at_what_you_talked_about/", "is_self": true}
