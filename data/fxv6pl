Today, we will be looking at a new form of analysis. Sentiment. Human Nature. Mental States. Stay with me here, and remember markets are different, the world is different, but human nature isn\u2019t different. History repeats itself, and how do I know that? History. This will be the argument to the bull, \"this time is different\" thesis. \n\n**Firstly, where are we in comparison to 2008?**\n\n[Graph](https://gyazo.com/39cb09e0aa9694022a68a59936062420)\n\nWhy am I showing you that graph? Let\u2019s get into the analysis. What did the public and investors think during 3/17 and 5/12. Thank you to the handy wayback machine we can figure this out. We are going to analyze three news sources, Bloomberg, CNBC, and the Wall Street Journal. \nLet\u2019s see what those poor suckers were thinking before things got really bad.\n\n4/30/08 [Bloomberg](https://gyazo.com/785f76c14fad2de53c206f991965d7be)\n\n\u201cStocks in U.S. Advance as Economic Growth Beats Forecast\u201d\n\nStocks were up; stocks only go up amirite? Michael Burry must have sure thought that a few times. \n\n5/01/08 [CNBC](https://gyazo.com/10296b3111dfcd3358fbb5925eae261e)\n\nNever change Kudlow. \n\n4/17/08 [WSJ](https://gyazo.com/13c79e3fd366b550cb777879a5795c2b)\n\nStocks rallying, Oil prices going up? Sounds familiar but I can\u2019t really put my finger on from where. \n\nPoint is, general sentiment during the initial rise before the drop was positive, bullish, recession canceled, stocks rallying even though the bad news was right in front of their faces, companies not doing so well, federal reserves fucking things up, etc. All this just means we are getting closer and closer.\n\nLink back to my TA post: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxj8jf/why_the_drop_will_happen_read_this_to_feel_better/)\n\nPersonal opinion NFA, the top is 293. Fast descent to 247, resistance, breaks, down to 219, resistance, relief rally to 247, resistance, fall through, SPY 180.
