Use at your own risk\n\n1.) keep as few positions as possible. We\u2019re all retarded here so more positions open = more money lost. \n\n2.) when opening a position, make sure it\u2019s something you\u2019re confident in, and go all in. If you\u2019re less confident but still want small tendies, open a smaller position. Better to be gay with money than gay without money. \n\n3.) never doubt the power of tariff man. One tweet can flip the entire market upside down, keep this in mind and don\u2019t bitch that you lost everything because of a tweet. This is your only warning.\n\n4.) market naturally goes up. If there\u2019s no news, things tend to grind upwards. Buying the dip will pretty much always work if your contracts are dated out far enough (though maybe those spy 400s for next year won\u2019t be profitable) \n\n5.) learn how to open a spread. If you\u2019re burning Day trades and are complaining that the PDT rule sucks, you\u2019re doing it wrong. Learn about spreads and they will save your cock and balls.\n\n6.) bet on the market once or twice a week. The 20s are going to be a time of wealth, TAKE PART IN IT. Trading multiple times a day will not be profitable in the long term, so take an actual bet once a week and focus on that success. \n\n7.) pay attention to news. Wallstreetbets is unironically one of the best tools for news and market behavior. Yes sometimes shit moons/ drills for no reason, but most of the time something is happening\n\n8.) the market is rigged AGAINST YOU. this is a losing game. Many more people have lost everything than have gotten rich of their free stock on Robinhood, so go in expecting to lose your shit\n\n9.) never underestimate the power of a good nights sleep\n\n10.) solid advice is to never put in more than you\u2019re willing to lose, but those on top didn\u2019t make millions by playing it safe. In the same vein, it\u2019s only money. You\u2019re going to have way more than one opportunity to make all your shitty dreams come true, losing is just part of the process. YOU WILL BE OKAY.\n\nDISCLAIMER: I\u2019m not a millionaire, I don\u2019t have any background in finance and I might be one of the least educated people on this sub. This is all stuff I learned myself and I\u2019m still learning. I\u2019m also not promising you shit. You could follow all of my shitty advice and still lose everything. Life sucks, then you die. \n\nTl;dr buy the dip pussy", "created_utc": 1565741528, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cq1tvf/gambling_tips_for_tendies/", "is_self": true}
