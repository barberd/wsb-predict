Essentially trying to create a time lime of what has happen recently and what\u2019s to come. \n\nI\u2019m also looking to create another spreadsheet that will track individual stocks, my entry position, stop-loss positions based off MA\u2019s, and recent/upcoming news that will affect the individual stock.\n\nI\u2019m not a professional trader, but I\u2019ve been learning very fast, watching videos and reading books nearly every day. The idea is too shift from trading emotionally to completely logically based off recent sentiment (news) combined with TA (moving averages, etc).\n\nIf anyone would like to be apart of it and wants to help me brainstorm a proper layout for such spreadsheets hit me up. The goal is to form a small group of individuals (both long term bulls and bears) to communicate on a regularly basis. Ideally, we can get a discord channel going to verbally communicate daily during market hours.\n\nIf you are interested in the idea shoot me a DM.. thanks", "created_utc": 1569384324, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d8y3yt/to_trade_with_logic_not_emotion/", "is_self": true}
