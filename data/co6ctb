{"id": "co6ctb", "title": "OSTK is the new potential short squeeze", "selftext": "OSTK is the stock to follow over the next couple of weeks if you're looking for another BYND-like situation where longs force the price up to try to get shorts to capitulate.\n\nThis looks like a potential short squeeze in motion.  S3's pre-earnings update: \" [$OSTK](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24OSTK&amp;src=cashtag_click) short int is $381 mm; 17.23 mm shs shorted; 60.81% of float; 61.86% borrow fee. Shs shorted are up +4.8 mm,+38.4%, in 2019; +637k, +3.84%, over the last 30 days; but down -618k, -3.46%, over the last week. There has been some covering ahead of the [\\#Overstock](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Overstock?src=hashtag_click)'s earnings. \"\n\nObviously OSTK hit it out of the park on earnings and is near $25.\n\nWe'll have to see how the short interest and numbers look in the days ahead.  Might be best to just keep it in mind and follow the short interest/borrow fee levels.  If the shorts cover too quickly and borrow fees come down fast, there won't be much of a squeeze here.\n\nThe squeeze scenario probably requires short interest to stay over 50% and borrow fees stay over 50% which would lead algs/longs to try to force this to mid-30s or higher.", "created_utc": 1565375016, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/co6ctb/ostk_is_the_new_potential_short_squeeze/", "is_self": true}
