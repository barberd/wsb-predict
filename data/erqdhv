However, the tops in 2015 and 2018 occurred in the 1st half of the year before the crashes happened. I don't like Chinese stocks long term due to the debt situation over there. If this virus gets out of hand and it becomes a crisis like the movie  Outbreak, it could get bad and spread the economic contagion to the US. The USA is by far the best stock market in the world.
