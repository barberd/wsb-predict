Hiring was weaker in retail, restaurants and hotels. The annual revision is much larger than is typically the case. The preliminary revision in 2018, for example, was just 43,000. Every year the Bureau of Labor Statistics updates its figures based on unemployment data that nearly all employers are required to file with the states. The current revision is one of the largest ever.\n\n***\n\nAnd now some interesting commentary from three weeks ago from [John Hussmann](https://www.hussmanfunds.com/comment/mc190805/):\n\n&gt; It\u2019s also important to recognize how strongly economic data tends to be revised, in hindsight, around recession turning points. For example, in the originally reported data for May through August 1990, as a new recession was emerging, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 480,000 total jobs were created (see the October 1990 vintage in Archival Federal Reserve Economic Data). But in the revised data as it stands today, those figures have been revised to a loss of 71,000 jobs for the same period.\n\n&gt; Consider early 2001. A U.S. recession had already started months earlier, but first-quarter GDP growth was initially reported at 1.2%. Based on final revision, that same quarter\u2019s GDP growth is now reported at -1.1%. The vintage data shows that non-farm payrolls were initially reported with a gain of 105,000 jobs during January-April 2001, while the revised data now shows a loss of 247,000 jobs.\n\n&gt; Likewise, by early 2008, the U.S. was also already in recession, but first-quarter GDP growth was initially reported at 1% growth. That figure was only later revised to -2.3%. The non-farm payroll reports were already deteriorating, with a cumulative job loss from February-May of 2008 of 248,000 jobs. Still, those initial reports pale in comparison to the revised figures, which presently show a loss of 550,000 jobs for the same period.\n\n&gt; Given that the ISM and Fed survey data are subject to little if any revision (depending on the series), and there is a strong correlation between that data and subsequent job growth, it\u2019s very possible that recent employment data may be revised after-the-fact.", "created_utc": 1566424516, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ctnr2q/us_created_501000_fewer_jobs_in_past_year_than/", "is_self": true}
