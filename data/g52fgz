{"id": "g52fgz", "title": "TL;DR Buy NAT", "selftext": "I can't believe how much time I wasted dicking around with EURN calls (though they're still printing) before I did some DD into NAT. I don't love DHT because they already contracted out a lot of their fleet for long-term storage, and at only moderately gouging prices. Need to learn more about TNK and FRO (though it looks like those entry points have become unattractive. Shame on me for missing them yesterday and this AM).\n\nNAT (around $5) comes with a .14 dividend ex-5/22, which I'm going to consider a discount on the purchase price. If I were to hold it past May, that becomes a yield of 11-12% depending on entry point. NAT is announcing earnings on 5/18. This is expected to be the first quarter in a long time with solid earnings and cash flow, even though it's mostly before the massive tanker rental price increase. Analysts haven't touched their EPS estimates for the quarter, year, or 2021 yet ***at all***. Debt exists, but is manageable and being paid down, and free cash flow is increasing bigly. They could probably use some free cash to retire more debt and will definitely return some to shareholders.\n\nWhat's amazing is this is mostly the situation **before** the oil glut and coronavirus pandemic! Tanker rental rates have skyrocketed, which is going to megacharge earnings and free cash flow, for at least the next few months (is two quarters too much to ask for?). Tankers sheltering in place reduces expenses slightly as well. With lending rates so low and strong assets to back up the business (\\~1.3billion to about 400 mil in debt), I could definitely see new debt being issued to retire old debt at lower rates. I wouldn't be shocked to see an increase in dividend, as even in loss-making quarters NAT has shown an extreme dedication to returning value to investors through dividends.\n\nThere's going to be a lot of very, very good news coming for this company in the next month, both rearward- and forward-looking. They got their shit figured out just in time to take advantage of these incredible ~~generational~~ first time ever conditions (we've never seen oil in super contango like this, ever, in the history of oil). I easily see NAT trading up to their 8ish year highs in the mid-teens within the next few months. Yes, the hype might bring this stock into overweight territory and oil will eventually stabilize. That's the whole \"sell high\" part of the equation. It's tough to see a situation where I'm still holding this stock six or nine months from now, but it's gonna be a great ride into the summer, and I think the value of holding NAT outweighs playing it with options. I'm also gonna play some options on it too, because WTH.\n\nNAT time leases: [https://www.nat.bm/nordic-american-tankers-ltd-nyse-nat-strong-position-for-our-ships/](https://www.nat.bm/nordic-american-tankers-ltd-nyse-nat-strong-position-for-our-ships/)\n\nDHT time leases: [dhtankers.com/dht-holdings-inc-announces-time-charters-for-six-of-its-vlccs/](https://dhtankers.com/dht-holdings-inc-announces-time-charters-for-six-of-its-vlccs/)\n\nYeah, some of the first few NAT leases are trash, but the beauty is that they're short term. Some of the later contracts are straight $$$$$$$$. DHT is locked into $67,300/day for 12-18 friggin months. NAT, OTOH, says \"\\[w\\]e have concluded contracts of longer\u00a0duration than above,\" above being 60 days, to capture price increases using shorter contracts. Since they were smart enough (smarter than DHT) to stop signing long-term contracts, hopefully they'll see when prices start to plateau and switch to signing long-term. This was in March. When oil prices still suck in mid-May (i.e. 60 days), DHT is going to be entering into new contracts. In March, even before oil got absolutely shitfucked to oblivion, they had deals on tanker time leases as high as $110,000/day.\n\nBuy some in extended hours, bitches.  Or don't.
