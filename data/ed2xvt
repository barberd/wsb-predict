{"id": "ed2xvt", "title": "This options strategy cannot go tits up", "selftext": "Found an options strategy that cannot go tits up.\n\nYou've heard: time in the market beats timing the market. Options are all about timing the market, so that must mean we'll always be beat. WRONG!\n\nThink about it, why does time in the market work? Because stonks only go up, right? Not exactly. By time in the market, the boomers mean sitting on their s&amp;p 500 index funds and cost averaging down. Even if stonks don't only go up, they profit because they bought in the valleys.\n\nSo us autists should be applying boomer logic to our trades, thereby gaining upward titification protection. Stonks don't only go up, but one thing they definitely do is zig zag up and down, this is fact, look at any chart. \n\nSo I propose a foolproof strategy. Treat options like a boomer treats their vanguard etfs. Choose a long term option and buy regularly through the peaks and valleys. You will have to be rewarded greatly, moreso than the boomer and his index, at some point in the options lifetime.\n\nTake TSLA for example. What if you had chose a 400 strike option 2 years ago and kept averaging regularly until now. You'd likely have over 4000% gains. The cost averaging made up for all theta decay and everything.\n\nYou're welcome autists, now get to investing the right way.", "created_utc": 1576805383, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ed2xvt/this_options_strategy_cannot_go_tits_up/", "is_self": true}
