{"id": "cfpbzg", "title": "THOTie Tendies (RVLV DD)", "selftext": "Im super long on Revolve Group to the tune of $9k in options and shares.\n\nWhy? Not pure autism. \n\nRead the prospectus. It will get you hard. \n\nThey've cracked the millennial/gen Z marketing code and the numbers speak for themselves. Using Social Media influencers and data driven marketing strategies they've been profitable for 15 out of their 16 year operating history. \n\nLet's start with basics: WTF is revolve group? Group of 3 brands selling variety of clothing and accessories to mainly young professional women. Three brands each have different price points. There's a higher end brand, a  more \"standard\" brand and a more \"cost effective\" brand. They sell their shit online using HEAVY Social Media marketing strategies with thousands of influencers on their payroll. \n\nDo yourself a favor right now. Check out Revolve's Instagram page. The pictures speak for themselves. They look fucking good. Now for comparison, check out a more traditional retailers Instagram page. Victoria's Secret is a good example. There is a NIGHT and DAY difference between the quality of posts between RVLV and Victoria's secret. The pictures on Revolve's page have professional lighting, professional editing, they look amazing. Vicky's posts look like trash in comparison. There's several \"mirror selfies\" on there. It's fucking pathetic. \n\nWhen your target demographic spends the whole day on Instagram, you better be damn sure your insta post looks fucking good. This is why $LB is down 20% over the past year and RVLV is up. \n\n\nThe numbers: revolve has already proven itself. Over the past 3 years, they've shown growth in margins (gross margins 53%), growth in revenues (21% growth in net sales year on year q1 2019), and massive growth in profits (512% growth in profits since 2017). Read the prospectus yourself if you don't believe me. \n\nThis trend is only the beginning. \n\nSocial Media influencers can drive tens of thousands of people to a shitty fake music festival in the Bahamas (see Netflix documentary FYRE fraud). When you harness this power and combine it with an actual GOOD product that customers actually like (and they do like this shit! 89% net sales retention year on year!) the results will be nothing short of phenomenal.\n\n\nRVLV has dipped recently with the broader market and i am buying this dip. Y'all do what you want. But I will say that I have a pretty good track record on WSB (go through my post history, undefeated). \n\n\nI welcome your thoughts.", "created_utc": 1563648563, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cfpbzg/thotie_tendies_rvlv_dd/", "is_self": true}
