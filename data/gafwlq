{"id": "gafwlq", "title": "Outdoor recreational vehicle stocks are actually solid Corona plays, and haven't yet priced in this fact", "selftext": "\nTl;dr: see title. If you think stonks will go up, buy in where recreation spending is being redirected.\n\nPt. 1: $BC Brunswick Corp, which owns Mercury Marine (leader in watercraft engines) and Brunswick Boat Group, which manufactures Sea-Ray, as well as the more fishing-oriented Lowe Boats and Boston Whaler.\n\nGoogle Trends search activity for Brunswick Corp.-related small fishing watercraft search terms was up this April compared to previous years.  I accumulated the data in a [table](https://i.imgur.com/IgUCA7H.png).  It's harder to see in the trends chart, except for the relatively [steep upticks at the end](https://i.imgur.com/EgSclHn.png).\n\n[Bass Pro Shops, not publically traded, confirms a \"fishing\" play at work](https://i.imgur.com/kLMAl3Z.png)\n\n**$BC earnings call is tomorrow.**  Like a lot of things, they're up bigly today, but I think they have room to run over Q2. Position: purchased yesterday before the run-up, 6/19 45c, but thinking of rolling it over to Sept. maybe?\n\n----\nPt. 2: $PII Polaris\n\nOk, the real interesting story is **Polaris $PII.**\n\nPolaris are a leading maker of recreational/outdoor utility vehicles like side-by-sides, ATVs, and snowmobiles.  They also own Indian Motorcycles, including sweet rides like [this](https://www.thedrive.com/motorcycles/23913/2019-indian-ftr-1200-and-ftr-1200-s-indians-flat-track-inspired-roadster-makes-its-debut).\n\n$PII just had an [earnings call yesterday](http://ir.polaris.com/investors/news/news-details/2020/Polaris-2020-First-Quarter-Results/default.aspx), and [actually maintained and built on their pre-earnings rally](https://i.imgur.com/g6Iwcc6.png) despite reporting (obviously) some [negative results](https://i.imgur.com/yuFVglU.png), including declines in sales lead by [boats and off-road vehicles](https://i.imgur.com/Vhs5wSa.png), with off-road vehicle profits declining mostly because of declines in sales of [side-by-sides](https://i.imgur.com/89Ax0i5.png).\n\n**Here's the DD: Google search activity for *all* ORVs is sharply up**, and is in fact at [**all time highs**](https://i.imgur.com/fIgsZKM.png).  This is reflected in [ORV searches including the word \"financing\"](https://i.imgur.com/S4rrx3A.png), suggesting this is real interest.\n\nBy contrast, there [is minimal change in searches for motorcycle brands](https://i.imgur.com/DWfzScl.png).  \"Jet ski\" also remains on trend, although perhaps it will spike as per usual later in the year.  (**With respect to motorcycles, it's interesting to note that Polaris reported Indian Motorcycles as a relative bright spot in Q1, despite not really reflecting in search.**) What this no-change tells me is that the increases in search activity are specific to certain sectors: namely, fishing/outdoor-recreation-adjacent activities.  It's not just that every dude is at home googling dream purchases because he's bored.  \n\nWhy does this matter?  [As noted in a fund's report on Brunswick](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insights-white-brook-capital-2020-174805036.html), any dollars that would have been allocated to vacations involving flying, cruise ships, theme parks, etc. are probably being redirected.  Add to that list bars, movies, etc.  Basically where are you going to be gathering with your family or drink with your friends?  Outdoors, away from 'caution'-taped park benches, and far from the coofing crowd (whether or not you think there's something be afraid of).\n\nPosition: $PII Sept 75c.  ATH is $93 or so.\n\nThoughts?", "created_utc": 1588188651.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gafwlq/outdoor_recreational_vehicle_stocks_are_actually/", "is_self": true}
