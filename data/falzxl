So that leads to my question..\n\nDo I YOLO my gains into more SPY puts that I won\u2019t be able to get out of tomorrow, and hold through the weekend? Or do I just watch everyone else rake in the tendies?", "created_utc": 1582849981, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/falzxl/hold_thru_the_weekend/", "is_self": true}
