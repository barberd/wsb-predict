{"id": "ft2aj6", "title": "Basic Millennial Reporting DD", "selftext": "This is my very scientific assessment of what's going on in the world based on my very scientific anecdata gained from my basic millennial experience. \n\n* my favorite tapas restaurant closed for a few weeks, changed their ingredients, and now tastes like shit. They no longer have my favorite pear salad, there was no confiture with my cheese, and the tortilla espa\u00f1ola tasted like cardboard. They are completely out of dessert (!). Clearly, they are having major supply chain issues. **Restaurants are dead.** \n\n* my relatives who live in Wuhan tell me that they are fine and that everything will go back to normal by April 8. This is almost certainly not going to happen, so it will be interesting to see how Chinese people react to further quarantine after a lockdown of more than two months. **Riots in China incoming.** \n\n* every store that I shop at has been sending me better and better offers when they *never* go on sale. Madewell, West Elm, Sephora, etc. Even my local Land Rover dealer is sending me offers to pick up my Range Rover and wash and disinfect it. Retail is getting desperate. I'm waiting for more desperation to buy at a huge discount. **Luxury retail is dead.** \n\n* I got tested for corona and it was indeed like getting stabbed in the brain. After the first nostril, I cried and had to summon the courage to offer my second nostril. It ended up being negative. I later read that you have to get stabbed for at least 15 seconds to get an accurate result, and mine was at most 5, so now I'm convinced I got a false negative. **False negative rates are extremely high, which means we'll never get this under control via mass testing the way South Korea has.** \n\n* my friend who is a nurse said they were out of masks and being told to bring in their own TWO WEEKS ago, when we had a total of 100 cases in the whole state. She also said we didn't have enough tests. My local hospital is currently at capacity with roughly 100 corona patients. A person in their 30s was the first death in my state. **The entire tri-state area is doomed.**\n\n* my other friend who lives in NYC is trying to escape. We offered him our condo to live in once he gets out of his lease. **We will see a mass exodus of people away from NYC and other big cities, and many of them will never go back.**\n\n* my one poor friend just got laid off. She is excited since she hated her job and doesn't have to pay her student loans. She doesn't think her former boss will hire her back. Even after the quarantine ends, she will probably have to spend months looking for a job. **Unemployment numbers are here to stay and will take time to improve even after the end of quarantine.**\n\n* personally, I've been a lot more frugal since corona (other than $25k on options and levered ETFs) and am hoarding cash to make money on the way down/up. Also waiting for real estate market to tank. **Deflation is coming, and the fed can't stop it.**\n\n* lastly, having traveled extensively in Europe, I know that people in UK are old, retarded and unhygienic, and Spain/Italy are fucked because of no tourism. There is also no culture of takeout there, so their restaurants are all fucked. Plus, puts on Europe are cheaper than SPY puts, and I want to be cooler than WSB. **Short Europe as an alternative to SPY.**\n\nPositions: EWU 16p 5/1 EWP 17p 7/17 RACE 135p 1/15 and SRS EPV TVIX", "created_utc": 1585756261.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ft2aj6/basic_millennial_reporting_dd/", "is_self": true}
