{"id": "f7bws9", "title": "Treasuries and gold at ATH is no reason to be concerned (fed repos)", "selftext": "Alright since the mods are banning every pump and shill post, let me give you guys a story of why inverse indicators such as Treasuries or told at ath is no worry for equities.\n\nThis is how a Fed repo works:\n\n1. Fed announced $100 billion or whatever of maximum repos.\n\n2. I, a bank who needs cash, find that borrowing from the fed is much cheaper than anyone on the street.\n\n3. I find out for the borrowing/repo, the fed only accepts Treasuries or MBS. \n\n3. Great, I have $100 billion worth. I pledge this to the fed and get $95 billion (or so) in cash.\n\n4. Is this enough? No. I want to leverage up to my personal risk tolerance and use the $95 billion to buy more Treasuries on the market. I pledge this to the fed again and get $90 etc. This is where the magic happens.\n\n5. As of now, these are 14 day loans. I essentially have 14 days to do whatever with the money before paying it back plus the 2.35%/360 days of interest.\n\n6. What do I do with the money? Of course make a return and thus throw it into the current vogue: US equities.\n\n7. If all goes well, I earn a leveraged return and return the money with no one the wiser.\n\nThis is essentially what happened before the crisis, except the person doing the lending were money market funds and the assets dirty MBS.\n\nSo, that's why everyone has been buying Treasury: to repo and buy stocks. As long as the fed keeps the spigot open, there are no problems.\n\nThis is much more effective than QE because QE is only $85b a month. Repos are currently $20 billion every two days.", "created_utc": 1582295633, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7bws9/treasuries_and_gold_at_ath_is_no_reason_to_be/", "is_self": true}
