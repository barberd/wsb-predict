If this goes the way it looks... Ouch...\n\nSBA loan program is NOT going well, even bank presidents are on 5-6 hour holds with the SBA trying to get information. By late afternoon total loan requests already stood at 22 Billion\n\nEconomists are admitting that they have no idea how to forecast what happens next and they are basically shooting in the dark. Without a vaccine, or some way to see how much longer this might go on, it's impossible to calculate much of anything and they are mostly guessing using historical data. There has NEVER been a world-wide shut down before.\n\nThe Mortgage loan forbearance is kicking that can 90 days down the road. Landlords who take this option may not evict tenants for a lack of paid rent during this period. Foreclosure is prevented against residential home holders and multi home residential landlords.\n If the president cancels the National Emergency Declaration, mortgages re-start instantly.\nCommercial borrowers aren't counted with almost any of these protections.\n\nThe CARES act allows you to withdraw up to $100,000 from your 401k (more puts anyone?!)\nIt HAS to be paid back within 3 years, or you are going to be sent a very unfortunate and large tax bill.\nI think this is another bomb just waiting to drop, there's no way the average person can pay back even a 20k loan in 3 years.\nMedian 401k savings in the 25-34 age range is at about $22,000. This would be a repayment plan of $305/monthly.\nAssuming the money is taken out to pay bills and living expenses because you are unemployed (average unemployment is 19-21 weeks) this now makes your monthly payment once re-employed (assuming a normal economy) $415 a month.", "created_utc": 1586048340.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fv4zul/information_part_2_the_horse_had_it_coming/", "is_self": true}
