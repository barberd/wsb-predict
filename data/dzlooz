{"id": "dzlooz", "title": "A DD on Disney Sub Count", "selftext": "As we know the Disney stock is beginning to move on sub count numbers in the same way as Netflix. So I prepared a short little DD using social media for you folks. Interpret it as you like\n\nNetflix: 151 paid subscribers (158 total)\n\nTwitter followers of 6.84 million results in a scalar of 22.076 (151/6.84)\nInstagram followers 19 mil results in a scalar of 7.95 (151/19)\n\nApply the scalars to Disney plus results in:\n784k Twitter * 22.076 = 17.3 million subs\n1.6 mil insta * 7.95 = 12.2 million subs\n\nThere are obvious drawbacks to this analysis so poke holes. Personally I think it is closer to 17 million or more because 1) many people will not start following a twitter handle or page for quite some time after subscribing to a service and 2) I think the Twitter demographic is a closer representation of the Disney plus demographic. Just my thoughts.\n\nLong DIS", "created_utc": 1574353389, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dzlooz/a_dd_on_disney_sub_count/", "is_self": true}
