{"id": "hc998t", "title": "Why PCG is a buy", "selftext": "Alright so someone yesterday posted some questionable DD about PCG. The stock dilution and price of stock offering shouldn't matter if we just consider the payout as a liability. \n\nAssets: 86.7B\n\nLiabilities: 50.8B\n\nSettlement: 25.5B\n\nValue: 10.4B\n\nMarket-Cap: 5.41B\n\nSo the company has a book value of 10.4B and will be protected from future liability through the California wildfire fund. We also have to consider that the company is being forced to upgrade its current infrastructure as part of its bankruptcy resolution. They are just passing this cost onto the consumer as rate hikes were recently approved to pay for upgrading their infrastructure and increasing margins (to secure debt for bankruptcy). \n\nAnalysts have price targets between $13-17, I think a $15 price target by the EOY is very reasonable. We could even see a quick pump in the next few weeks as investors respond to their successful exit from bankruptcy. \n\nPlays: $11c 6/26, $13 1/15/21, $20 1/21/22 for reasonable humans...$12c 6/26 for the degens.", "created_utc": 1592602478.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hc998t/why_pcg_is_a_buy/", "is_self": true}
