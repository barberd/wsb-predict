{"id": "hjwkk3", "title": "PCG Bankruptcy Exit Insights", "selftext": "I've posted a couple times about PCG, and with my work background dealing with utility/oil sector fund of funds and ibanking, I wanted to briefly outline what's been happening in this stock. \n\nI've been diamond hands holding this stock because I believe in its fundamentals and metrics. Throughout this entire time, mm's were steadily walking down price bc their clients/funds were not allowed to invest in a bankrupt company. Goldman and Morgan sold their underwriting offering shares (150m), which is common, investment banks still make money from it even at flash sale prices. This was the majority of the dilution effect that brought the price down to 8. They were most likely hedging the market volatility climate a few days ago as well. I believe dilution has been completed until about $16-18, when PCG may decide to re-issue per their agreement months down the line (after fire victims' lock-out period).\n\nNow that they are officially out of bankruptcy, a lot of large name institutions can invest. I've seen large dark pool prints already. The last time I made a post, I ended the post commenting how it would reach a high of $10 that day, and it ripped from 9.40 to 10 before closing. I think PCG can reach 12-12.50 by next week, however, buying shares would be the safest bet. Too many people have been complaining about calls.\n\nThe CA fire fund alone will overtime (when fully initially funded) \n add 3 to 4 PE points to PGE and 1-2 to other 2 CA big utilities.\n\nI'm expecting PCG to shoot to at least offering price of 9.50 early today with a good possibility of 10 by eod. It has already hit 9.65 pre-market. The backstop parties and institutions have switched sides from shorting to buying for accumulation as of today. The only selling pressure will come from swing traders that have bought in at 8 the last couple of days.\n\nPosition: Shares for accumulation\n\nEdit: Also, Robinhood users haven't even jumped in yet because RH erroneously sent users that PCG is going into bankruptcy and exiting. Expect a measure of pop from RH when the news is current on the app.", "created_utc": 1593694843.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hjwkk3/pcg_bankruptcy_exit_insights/", "is_self": true}
