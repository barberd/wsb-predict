{"id": "g5285p", "title": "Arcus Biosciences ($RCUS) Short", "selftext": "On April 15th a rumor emerged that Gilead is potentially interested in taking a stake in Arcus because of its interest in cancer treatment ONE Rx (which is still in phase 1 testing with no results until 2022). This has caused the share price to sky rocket >100% over the last week.\n\nThe rumor was posted on Bloomberg by Citigroup Inc. analyst Mohit Bansal. After doing some research on Mohit Bansal, it seems that he has made claims in the past that amounted to absolutely nothing. Furthermore, I called Katherine Bock (VP of Investor Relations at Arcus) today and she confirmed it was just a rumor.\n\nGilead recently dished out $4.9B last month to acquire Forty Seven and has not been doing too hot with its $12B acquisition of Kite. My guess is that with the current focus on Remdisivir and very recent acquisition history that even if these rumors are true it won't happen in the immediate future. And even if Gilead does take a stake, why would it be at double the market value of what Arcus was trading at last week??\n\nArcus is a thinly traded stock. Volume has dried up and was 1/4 today as the volume last Friday. I wouldn't touch options on this because the spreads are huge and the volume/OI is extremely low.\n\nThe rumors could be true and my position could get fucked - but im willing to bet on it all being a load of BS and see a near term decline in price on this low float stock. Here is my position:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8ipk4xwsn1u41.png?width=842&format=png&auto=webp&s=8853bdac7a194756e5817aa3980e4d628de4e44d", "created_utc": 1587419708.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5285p/arcus_biosciences_rcus_short/", "is_self": true}
