Autists gather and find who will go bankrupt", "selftext": "Being an autist who didn't have the balls to pull the trigger on SPY puts early enough, I am trying to think outside of the box. Anything is better than getting FOMO, buying SPY puts at this point and getting fucked in the ass by IV dropping when the shit finally starts to settle down a bit. \n\nIn the current hysteria we retards find ourselves in, some major companies are bound to bite the dust and go bankrupt. Someone who won't be able to weather the storm of close to zero revenue for a few months while everything is shut down. Companies with not enough cash on their balance sheets. Companies down to their necks in debt. \n\nCan UBER or LYFT survive a couple of months while everyone is holed up in their basements preparing for the apocalypse? Can BYND survive when people don't want to eat out in general, let alone consider fake fucking meat?\n\nThis thread is for suggestions. Which company do you autists think will be a perma corona victim? Who is the Lehman brothers equivalent of 2020? Make some suggestions and let's short the fuck out of them for mega-tendies.", "created_utc": 1584052958.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhp715/late_on_the_spy_puts_train_autists_gather_and/", "is_self": true}
