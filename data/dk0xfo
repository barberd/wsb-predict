Sounds stupid as shit, right? Not so fast.\n\nFor my true Wsb'ers, I'll cut to the chase: \n\nIRBT either pops or drops +10% each earnings.\n\nThey have a small share float of just 28m shares with 30% short. \n\nThey're down 37% on the year. 1Y chart looks like this stock just needs a reason to go up.\n\nNext week's IV for earnings is +100% with an expected +$8-9 move.\n\nActual DD: They lowered guidance last earnings because they let everyone know their margins could be impacted by the trade war. Expectations are low. They also have one of the cleanest balance sheets I've ever set my eyes on. They just unveiled their new robotic lawnmower that's one of a kind.\n\nNot only that, but they also have an ongoing lawsuit against an evenly matched competitor they're favored to win and are also a very suited candidate for an acquisition. \n\nTL/DR: I'm buying 150 shares and 10/25 65-67 calls and hedging with 1-2 10/25 47-49 puts before Tuesday close.", "created_utc": 1571473483, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dk0xfo/irbt_dd_earnings_are_tuesday_1022/", "is_self": true}
