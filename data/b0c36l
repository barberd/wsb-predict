{"id": "b0c36l", "title": "$BA, where is it going now", "selftext": "So if you followed my other post you bought puts mid-session or late-session Monday, and those are starting to look pretty good now that countries and regulators have started to ground the MAX, but the big question still remains: will the FAA or BA ground the MAX family in the states before it \"fixes\" (changes) the MCAS software on the new planes.   \n\n\nThis is a very good question to consider, and I honestly think the answer is a lot more complicated than I initially thought. We are seeing very well respected regulatory authorities in aviation prohibit the MAX from flying through their airspace, and BA/NTSB haven't even released any data from the recovered flight data recorder(s). Yet the FAA has remained silent and Boeing is essentially confirming that MCAS is to blame and pushing the message that there is no need to ground their planes.  \n\n\nYou've seen this already the sub already, but there are airlines here in the states that already depend heavily on these new jets. LUV and AAL especially **require** these jets in operation for their network to function. If the MAX family was prevented from flying, their routes would be devastated and both airlines could cancel thousands of flights while Boeing works to roll out the new software. For this reason **(and this is purely 100% speculation)**, I do not think that the FAA will ground the MAX family, nor will BA recommend they do so. **If** the proposed MCAS/pilot error combination is found to be responsible for the downing, Boeing can apply a hot fix to these aircraft with different software.   \n\n\nSo, what do? Will we continue to see downward pressure on BA, or will BA begin to recover and avoid the extreme hit that would be the result of an FAA ban? That's for you to decide, but I will say that I sold my puts about mid-session today, and that is what I would personally recommend.  \n\n\nAgain I am not a professional trader or financial adviser, I do not fly jets, I do not work for the FAA, and I don't have all that much experience gauging market sentiment.   \n\n\nQuestions and comments welcome.", "created_utc": 1552419712, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b0c36l/ba_where_is_it_going_now/", "is_self": true}
