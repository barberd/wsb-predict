BSBA Accounting and Finance, AS Math (i.e. through calc trifecta, linear alegebra, stats). Learning Java and learn R or Python by end of next year.** \n\nHello degenerates, wannabe or real boss money makers, need some advice. I'm got almost both feet out of operating in industrials after 12 years since 2007. If you're wondering, on the OP side, I'm hitting an efficiency / scale issue and mfg is dead/slow death. And I don't want to do $2M in CAPEX which would get me to an efficient 10m$ in sales, given a 18 month cycle and lots of issues, my heart isn't in it anymore. So stonks...but thinking mainly FDs.\n\nI've been trading for the last 90 days and -50% unrealized based on some volatility plays. I'm full ok with it going to 0 but I need to make a decision on the next 90 days in what to do. I've figured out to pay the mortgages and have ramen money for me and my wife, who is supportive as we don't have children. Should I go work for an investment firm, test for CFA 1 in December? Or should I do what I did the first go around in business, figuring it out as I go along through pain?", "created_utc": 1572204353, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dny90l/need_advice_leaving_operating_in_industrials_to/", "is_self": true}
