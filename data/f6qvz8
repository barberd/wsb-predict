(which is what happens most of the time)  \n\nSo, what if I invested $10k in TQQQ and also $10k in SQQQ?  \nPutting beta slippage aside for a bit, let's say market goes up like it has for the past couple months and TQQQ doubles in price again - I made my loss back from SQQQ and then some.  \nIf market tanks because of corona, I can take 50~80% profit from SQQQ to make back unrealized loss in TQQQ, and then when market eventually rebounds, I will probably either make it all back and then some from TQQQ.  \nAside from beta slippage which honestly doesn't really pose a threat in a real-world chart for at least 4 year timeframes and the risk of indexes not moving in either direction(highly doubtful), this literally can't go tits up risk free profit.  \nI must be wrong here since the idea is too easy.  \nWhat am I thinking wrong here?", "created_utc": 1582192619, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6qvz8/free_money_glitch_with_tqqqsqqq/", "is_self": true}
