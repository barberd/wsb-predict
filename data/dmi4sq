ATM by end of month!", "selftext": "ROKU acquisition today DD from a few days ago\n\nI think this is a game-changing acquisition.....under appreciated as of today....that will change quickly. Amazon and Trade Desk should be worried. Jeff Bezos definitely does not like shaking hands on an agreement with a partner that eventually agrees to be bought out by his rival.\n\nAnd now Roku owns them.....\n\nOh and also last week Roku added support for an Apple TV app. \n\nIt\u2019s unlikely knowing Apple\u2018s track record that it will enable a Apple TV app on their streaming competitors platform (Amazon Fire)\n\nI can hear some of you retards saying this in my head before I post this so let\u2019s address this:\n\n\n[\u201c_bUt iT dROpPeD tODaY?_ \u201c](https://google.com/search?q=acquisition+effect+on+stock+price) yep, that\u2019s normal. When a company acquires another company, typically the stock price of the target company rises while the stock price of the acquiring company declines in the short-term.\n\nI now or soonish is a great time to get in, especially after today and could be seeing new all time highs leading up or right after their upcoming ER on Nov 6th\n\nLet\u2019s watch how tomorrow plays.\n\n\nThis is a good breakdown in the conclusion https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dataxu-acquisition-means-roku-stock-211816340.html\n\nThey have the largest market share already.\n\nNow what do you think will happen to apples market share now that Roku has Apple TV support? Exactly. \n\nThe Roku app are built into most smart TVs and that doesn\u2019t seem to be changing.\n\nI\u2019m now accepting reddit gold!
