I figured DIS and SPY would be just as profitable. Bought some FDs cause I'm retarded and now I'm sitting at under $500. Closed my 4/9 DISp today at a massive loss (75%) but held on to my 5/1 $225 SPYp with the slight hope I can just one last taste of that sweet, sweet bear cum. My next moves are cash gang until this fiesta is over with but even then I'm gonna stick to spreads. My losses aren't near as bad as some of them ones I've seen on here so it could be worse. Imagine not being bearish during a global pandemic with millions of Americans unemployed and more to come. \n\nTLDR: don't bet against the feds, fuck single leg options and good bye \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b life.", "created_utc": 1586206229.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fw6qzo/i_rode_the_train_too_long/", "is_self": true}
