Ultimately, the financiers of these movies are looking for a solid ROI and 9/10 times that's their highest priority (I say 9/10 times bc I remember Bladerunner 2049 was more of a passion project). \n\nThey could have just bought TSLA and even if they timed the market like shit they'd have $600 million already, and $1b by next month before the movie is even done in theaters. What a joke lol\n\nThe movie market is going to crash when these dudes figure this out", "created_utc": 1578948826, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eoa5ni/why_do_people_make_movies/", "is_self": true}
