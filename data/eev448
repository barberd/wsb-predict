Go back in time and retake it, you know all the right answers now. Accidentally ride your bike into a stop sign while scratching you back, impaling your tooth through your lip and imprinting a hexagon onto the side of your face, leaving you to eat through a straw for the next two weeks? Yea you can reverse that too. Made a move on your crush and get told that she just sees you as a good friend? Your ego might still be shattered but atleast you can reverse the public shaming. \n\nYea flying is cool, super strength would be helpful, webslinging is pretty... wait webslinging would actually be pretty dope ngl. Well anyways imagine how \"lucky\" you would always be with the ability of time travel. I know all of you would've dumped your bank account into ITCI last week. Such a shame. \n\nNow imagine this power with the market. Constant 1500% roi. Your all time return is at 10,000% because it only took you 100 bucks to create a million dollar portfolio. Just think of it, literal free tendies. Couldn't go tits up. Well after watching doctor strange I decided to not let me dreams just be dreams, but to become reality. \n\nI booked my trip to Tibet, I spent my last 3 years high up in the Tibetain mountains studying with the monks. Various breathing techniques, hundreds of hours of meditation; I could literally feel the autism flowing through me. Now I would just had to properly control it to shape time around me. I tried for months to conjure portals to leap through time, but alas there was no fruitition to my labor. Frustrated, I confronted the head monk. \n\n\"You cannot manipulate the market for profit, you must become the market for profit.\" Become. The. Market. TA, DD, even the very graphs you stare at daily, they're all just distractions for simpletons. I decided that no outside forces shall shape my decisions. Just pure unadulterated autism shall be my driving force. I quickly headed home to put my new found powers to the test. \n\nPeloton, hmmm. 4 thousand dollar work out bikes. 40 dollar monthly subscriptions. This is it. In the dead of night I swiped my mom's social and signed the bitch up for Robinhood. \"Peloton to 45 by the 27th\" I thought to myself while funneling her life saving into Robinhood, buying as many calls as I could. \"This is it, free tendies for life.\" \n\n\"Guh\". You probably know how this story ends, plus I have to go anyways because this bitch librarian keeps telling me \"we have to close soon\". If any of you could Venmo me at @stophittingmemomitwasamistake that would be great. I may not of been able to earn tendies, but maybe I can eat some Wendy's tendies tonight instead of dumpster diving.", "created_utc": 1577156442, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eev448/til_tibetain_monks_know_nothing_about_the_market/", "is_self": true}
