I won't die sober.\n\nChegg is a company that sells homework help to students. \n\nAll you have to do to  KNOW that Chegg's business is bound to grow is look at the statistics on college enrollment. Gross number of students going up, while scholarship numbers remain stagnant (cuz seriously who is giving kids money to go to college for FREE lmao). That means more dumb kids are enrolling. Guess what dumb kids have trouble with, especially while away from their natural support system: homework. \n\nBut then they remember. They're already in balls deep on this education YOLO and what's another $15 per month for straight A's? \n\nFucking shit is down from $40+ to ~$31.50. THIRTY ONE AND A HALF. And there is basically no news. A company like Chegg -  who prints money by charging monthly for digital content that has a guaranteed customer base, and increases profits by paying assholes who can't get better jobs shit wages to keep doing homework after they fucking graduate - has a bad quarter every now and then because they haven't hired a grown up to make sure the balance sheet looks impeccable. \n\nThey fuck up occasionally, but they are the industry leader by a mile. You can type your homework, paste it to Google, Chegg is always the first link. Any dumb ass can find this website. \n\nCalls. Line em up. BIG. Short Term? Probably not. But by January?
