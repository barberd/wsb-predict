{"id": "begivf", "title": "Bullish on Uber's IPO (fight me)", "selftext": "Quick background: former investment banker turned VC\n\nGeneral perception seems to be that Uber won't be a performing Company based on Lyft tanking post-IPO. However, I would argue otherwise and I believe that in the long run Uber will be a strong investment (and that it couldn't be more different than Lyft). Here are the key points and feel free to challenge me:\n\n1. Ride hailing service and its costly subsidies is a winner takes all market where deeper pockets will allow Uber to win the war of attrition over Lyft.\n2. Uber is a Transportation company not a Taxi company. Uber Freight, Uber Eats, JUMP and the Company's recent efforts in public transportation will propel growth for years to come.\n3. Uber's large equity stake in global competitors with Monopolistic presence (India, Russia, China)\n4. Regarding growing loses: most people (atleast on stocktwit and WSB) don't seem to understand that these are temporary and that the price of the stock is determined by future earnings not past earnings. Loss were primarily driven by subsidized rides and promotions to gain market shares which should eventually diminish as they gain ground.\n\nOn a side note I recommend investing in Zoom's IPO tomorrow.", "created_utc": 1555555689, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/begivf/bullish_on_ubers_ipo_fight_me/", "is_self": true}
