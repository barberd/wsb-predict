I'm gonna make a killing on these puts so suck my fat coco\n\nLook I'm not saying the broader market is gonna collapse or anything but Aurora is way the fuck overvalued rn. I bought some 7/17 12p today because they were dirt fucking cheap.\n\nTime horizon for correction? Idk. This week? This month maybe?\n\nLook kiddos just buy puts lol\n\n6/12 12p\n6/12 10p\n7/17 12p\n7/17 10p\n\nFrankly any put you want will work haha", "created_utc": 1589828062.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gm7m3g/aurora_acb_what_goes_up_must_come_down/", "is_self": true}
