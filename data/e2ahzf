This thing has gotten way ahead of itself. \n\n1 YR up 400% and up 75% in the past month. \n\nSure the $MDCO buyout should boost RNAi stocks but not 75% in a month.  I believe the $MDCO valuation was actually quite rich at close to $10B. The moment the biotech sector takes a dip $ARWR will sell off. \n\nRSI and technicals are extremely overbought. I think this also gives management a unique spot to raise money ahead of a big year for their pipeline. They have $300 mill in cash and are projecting a cash burn of $25-30 million per quarter next year. Why not raise at these highs? \n\nI bought the March 2020 $60 puts.", "created_utc": 1574828204, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e2ahzf/anyone_else_crazy_arwr_puts/", "is_self": true}
