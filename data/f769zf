Turns out, the FCC is having some trouble getting free space on the C Band spectrum, because Intelsat isn't having any of their shit.  \n\nThe FCC offered Intelsat 5 billion dollars to free up some airwaves. Somehow David Tepper, owner of the Carolina Panthers, caught wind of this and said fuck that. Two days ago, Big Dick David bought a seven percent stake in the company and told them to demand more money. The stock went up 26% after this power move.\n\nIntelsat exceeded earnings PM today (Feb 20) and their stock rose another 13%\n\nThey are now reportedly demanding around 9.5 billion from the FCC which will cover all of Intelsats current debt with an extra 4-5 billion to spare. The FCC is scheduled to make a decision on Feb 28th and something tells me they'll pay up. An extra 4.5 billion is chump change to the govt. Plus if they don't agree to terms Intelsat's just going to file bankruptcy and take the FCC to court to protect the band.\n\n\nTLDR: $I calls 3/6 6 or 6.50 cheap af right now", "created_utc": 1582261700, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f769zf/invest_in_i_if_you_want_those_5g_tendies/", "is_self": true}
