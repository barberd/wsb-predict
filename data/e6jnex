For just the price of 3 full service weekends with your mom, you too can own this wonderful bike. I mean why pay for a $12 Gym membership and have access to a wide range of machines and trainers for every aspect of your body when you can buy this bike for 2.5k and pay $12.49 a month for YouTube videos. Tired of your wife being fat and having sex with your neighbor? Try buying her a bike! She won\u2019t ever use it, however your neighbor will let her ride him like a peloton bike! With a market capitalization 1000x that of FORD and 3 billion more than planet fitness, there\u2019s no theory under which this is overvalued. Buy now while supplies last. I know me and all my 8,000,000 friends are buying 7 each this holiday season, because I, as a millennial, have near infinite space in my house for such a device. Can\u2019t wait! Merry Christmas everyone and have a happy PTON. Buy PTON if your P weighs a TON. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\u2604\ufe0f\ud83c\udf46\ud83c\udf46\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcaf", "created_utc": 1575563692, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e6jnex/post_67_on_pton/", "is_self": true}
