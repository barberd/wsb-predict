In the link above, there is talk of the senate voting on a bill which would require Chinese companies to have increase oversight And be delisted if they don\u2019t comply.  There looks to be bipartisan support for the bill and a nonnegligible chance that it will get passed. When looking at some companies that would be affected by this, it doesn\u2019t seem like the possibility of getting delisted is priced in yet. Given how cheap you can find some way OTM puts, the risk reward might be worth picking some up as lotto tickets. \n\nMy target companies are Chinese companies that have had scandal/been accused of fraud but haven\u2019t completely tanked yet. These would include tickers like TAL, IQ, GSX (although puts on gsx are very expensive right now due to all the short seller reports recently) and others if anyone has any good ideas for other companies in a similar boat.", "created_utc": 1589988028.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gnd97p/cheap_lotto_tickets_buy_extremely_otm_leap_puts/", "is_self": true}
