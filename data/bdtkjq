I'm all for it, I'm long on Nio (LEAPS and shares), but fundamentally they need to create massive demand for their models and I'm not sure if introducing a new model will create that demand, but it should definitely help. Tesla has shown that demand is really all you need to go from $17 to $270 in the EV industry (despite their shit financials, Musk God's antics, failure to execute seamlessly on Gigafactories, etc.).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPoor Man's DD (off the top of my head): all #'s in USD\n\n\\- Chinese EV industry is set to blow up as the Chinese gov't is essentially mandating EVs due to pollution, helping with subsidies, tax benefits, making it illegal ride share drivers to drive regular ICE (gas) cars, $10K for a license to drive an ICE car and only a select few chosen through lottery can drive one\n\n\\- China has pulled 800 million residents (800 million!) out of poverty in the past 20 years creating a whole new middle class (and upper class) with money who are willing to spend that money\n\n\\- Nio is a first mover and has the backing of Tencent, the giant global conglomerate (they own large part of Fortnite and bunch of other games and media/entertainment outlets, and companies); Nio has a niche customer base: they also are the only EV within the the \\~$60K price point, most EVs in china are very small and under $30K. Due to tariffs Teslas are $100K+, although their costs will decrease once their gigafactory in Shanghai opens\n\n\\- Despite burning through cash, Nio is sitting on a boatload of cash (\\~$1B) and their working capital is huge positive; they will be able to pay off their ST debt and fund the next few Q's of operations without diving into debt\n\n\\- Nio has an app where only 1 in 20 people actually own a Nio car signifying popularity and demand for those who do not own one. Nio also has clubhouses around China at \"Nio Houses\" where Nio car owners can hang out which is pretty cool. They are trying to create a lifestyle, similar to Nike and Apple\n\n\\- William Li, the CEO was the founder of BitAuto, an online car marketplace, which is also a billion dollar company, so this is not his first rodeo\n\n\\- Nio has over 10,000 employees. They also have branches in Silicon Valley/Cali for engineering and R&amp;D to further develop their product. They currently only sell EVs in China though\n\n\\- As much as people may want to push Nio as a \"Chinese Meme Stock\", they have incredible resources, reach, fanbase, and reasonable demand. People may want to dismiss all chinese stocks as memes, but when you look at a company like Alibaba that literally pulls in $30B in one day ( [https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/11/alibaba-singles-day-2018-record-sales-on-largest-shopping-event-day.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/11/alibaba-singles-day-2018-record-sales-on-largest-shopping-event-day.html) ), you can't ignore the results\n\n\\- As far as I can tell from videos both Chinese and and US on Youtube and Youku, the car itself is actually a solid product, the tech of the car is great (i.e. interface and AI personal assistant), the battery tech could use some work (i.e. weird battery swapping)\n\n\\- Nio and Tesla can coexist (despite Nio being called the Tesla Killer), they have different customer bases in China where a Tesla EV is essentially double the price of a NIO EV\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite all this, I think the Nio car in itself is kinda ugly, especially the front headlights, which is my biggest worry", "created_utc": 1555419100, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bdtkjq/nio_previews_new_sedan_model_nio_discussion_poor/", "is_self": true}
