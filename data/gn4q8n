{"id": "gn4q8n", "title": "MOMO momentum", "selftext": "Tl;dr buy 6/19 25c\n\nAlright you twats I am happy to share that I have some terrible free advice that I am willing to hand out. Not in any self-interested fashion because if you all pump this on my behalf I\u2019ll probably be more jacked to the tits than even you will be, but from an altruistic perspective of wanting what is best for all of WSB. So listen up, MOMO is the next Chinese meme stock and I am loading up the dump truck with some lottery tickets er options. Why you ask? Because I am bored, and I like tendies. With 0% confidence, here are the key factors driving my decision.\n\n**1.\tNon-financials AKA what matters most**\nChina\u2019s economy is back up and running in advance of the rest of the world, they have a huge population, and people were just stuck in quarantine for months. So guess what, a social media and dating platform company is probably in a good position to capitalize on that. In April 2020, Tantan (China Tinder which was acquired by Momo in 2018) ranked in the top 5 of data apps for overall revenue. Plus, JD.com, BABA, HUYA, etc. are killing it, and there seems to be resilience in the Chinese meme stocks.\nhttps://imgur.com/a/jwEJBKO\n\n**2.\tFinancials AKA what does not matter at all**\nI read somewhere that their discounted cash flow valuation is in the $45-$50 per share neighborhood. Some Wall Street analysts have 12 month price targets in the $40 range, and the lower targets are still 10%+ ($26) above the current market value (~$23). Basically this company is printing money like JPow but investors are not buying in for various reasons. Call it Gyna fear, not trusting foreign companies, trade war, whatever. From a comparables perspective, MEET is trading at 60x TTM P/E, MTCH is trading at 42.53x TTM P/E, FB is trading at 30.67x TTM P/E. MOMO is trading at 11.79x. There is obviously a ton of room for multiple expansion, granted we are comparing US vs. Gyna so it is an imperfect comparison at best. NOT TO MENTION we are talking trailing-twelve-month multiples, which totally discounts the forward earnings growth rate advantage that MOMO has over its mature US-based peers. \n\nAdditionally the CEO owns over 20% of the outstanding common shares, so clearly he is incentivized to reverse the recent share price decline. He sold 5% of his holdings (1% of the shares outstanding) in 2017 and has not sold any stock since then.\n\nOn the analyst side of things, Thomas Chong from Jeffries was on the recent earnings calls asking direct questions to get information related to his 8/27/2019 buy recommendation with a price target of $42.20. Remember, this earnings call was mid-march and he absolutely could have changed his PT but has not. Three analysts did revise PTs after Q4 earnings, at $26, $26, and $36 respectively. Even if the bare minimum PT is realized sooner rather than later (read: June not 12 months from now) there is still ample upside in the stock.\n\n**3.\tTA**\nThe chart just looks stupid attractive, even after the pullback at EOD on 5/19. Stock just closed above the 50-day MA clearly breaking a long downtrend. Candlesticks are bullish showing a reversal with a pair of hammer candles at the bottom. There is clearly support at $22 and $20. If you look at the Fibonacci levels, there is a ton of room to the upside for retracement. Momentum indicators (Williams %R, Stochastics, and MACD) are all turning positive. First target is around $27 and the next is $30.\nhttps://imgur.com/a/AM9Pj61\n\n**4.\tTiming \u2013 I have no fucking clue**\nMOMO is expected to report earnings on Thursday May 28th before the US market opens. There was tepid guidance issued on the March earnings call and I believe China has rebounded better than expected, so my guess is they will beat the previously set (low) guidance.\n\n**5.\tRisks**\n1. Gyna. Enough said\n2. False accounting and/or fraud. This is always a concern and possibility. I read through the entire last earnings call and looked into the background of the executive leadership and nothing jumped out as a major concern. Particularly the CFO has a clean record so that provides a level of comfort there. The operations executive clearly knows what lingo to use and what their company focus is to drive revenue. \n3. Institutional ownership decrease. Blackrock opened a 7.0% position ($750M) on 12/31/2019 and cut that same position to 4.3% ($316M) on 3/31/2020 which is a net realized loss of about $90M based on the difference in share price. Could be for any number of reasons. FMR LLC cut its ownership from 5.347% in 2/2019 to 0.403% in the same time period. Could be related, who knows. Big institutional outflows do not look great, but these fuckers might just have paper hands. These exits were not surprisingly at almost exactly a 20% loss, so I am going to chalk it up to responsible portfolio management \u2013 nothing any of us understand. Blackrock could have also just been rebalancing. Or the fact that this money is chump change compared to the trillions of AUM and it was a bad YOLO at that time. Do I think I am smarter than the boiis at Blackrock? Hell no. \n\nWhat I\u2019m buying\n6/19 25c; there was 1.3k volume on 5/19 against 283 open interest. If you wanted to hedge, you could open a strangle with a 20p.\n\nI am looking at maybe picking up July or October contracts as well but I truly do not understand the strike prices showing $XX.26 so I may not fuck with that noise.", "created_utc": 1589949267.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gn4q8n/momo_momentum/", "is_self": true}
