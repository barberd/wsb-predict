{"id": "gs468p", "title": "DHT ahead of a trading day", "selftext": "With the growing amount of TA on this sub, I figured I'll share what I look at here. This time on DHT tankers because many of us share a love and hate relationship with tankers in general.\n\nI like DHT charts because they are pretty well defined \ud83c\udf46\ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6, but the technicals are more or less the same across the board if you look at FRO or TNK, except I think those two went up about 18-25% by now, while DHT is only up about 12% off its lows.\n\nDHT is setting up for a potential 10-20% upside in my opinion. After topping on 4/28 at $8.64, the poor thing fell about 36%. I fell asleep by the wheel and didn't notice how it bottomed on 5/22. It recovered about 12% since then, but I think there is still some fuel left in the tank. I don't have a fundamental case this time, but here is the technical case:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Clear falling wedge with bullish divergences on both RSI and PPO. Bottomed at about $5.50 then bounce and subsequent backtest of the trendline. Gap up the day after on 5/26, then on 5/27 we ran into resistance.\n2. On daily charts, DHT is still in bearish territory on PPO but daily charts take more time to move than shorter time frame charts like hourly.\n3. Given that between 5/6 and 5/15 DHT have been bouncing off $6.23 level, it looks that this was a significant support level back then (and even if you look at daily chart we had lots of reactions off the same level in the past). Recovering this level today should open the door for more upside.\n4. Now with all that said. At the moment, DHT sits slightly above $6.23 level in pre-market. I think if it maintains above that level after the first hour of regular session trading, or even better if it paints a big green candle, this may prove to be a successful break out and should open the potential for another 10% or maybe 20% upside. The next resistance levels would be around $6.90 and $7.58 where the reactions are likely.\n5. At the same time don't disregard that it's getting close to overbought on hourly charts by now, although not guaranteed, it may pull back a little, but it would be bearish if it fell too much below $6.23 on hourly candle.\n\nTLDR; So uppsies or downies? DHT above 6.23 at 10.30am - calls, DHT below 6.23 - puts. I trade stocks this time, so I'd go long if it remains above the given level 1 hour into market open or short if it starts dumping.\n\n[DHT 1h chart](https://preview.redd.it/1vm3buk8hh151.png?width=3906&format=png&auto=webp&s=254fa471b904ed71590b1f8796604d5f8288c77c)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[DHT 1d chart](https://preview.redd.it/doqlef6uhh151.png?width=3906&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f755bd2c6c388d7c2a87d3b6272e44dfbce8030)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[DHT 1h chart: consolidation between 5\\/6 and 5\\/15 before the leg down](https://preview.redd.it/objbvm4rih151.png?width=3906&format=png&auto=webp&s=575c72fa0d67171255811cc2df07960aa935a71c)", "created_utc": 1590663628.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gs468p/dht_ahead_of_a_trading_day/", "is_self": true}
