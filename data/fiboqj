I've been lurking the sub since about November of last year hoping to pick up some sweet tendies but have remained too hesitant and shackled to student-loan debt to take any of the retarded risks that make and break lives on the daily here. \n\nGot about a 1000 dollars in Acorns right now. Extra 500 in another savings account. I put 5 dollars into Acorns every day; but ever since the market started tanking, I've noticed 2 or sometimes even three 5 dollar deposits being made to my Acorns account. Definitely shady. But I can afford 10-15 dollars here and there. Assuming they don't want people panic-pulling all their money out and so they're hinging on daily depositors not checking their bank accounts and thus maintain the illusion of gains.\n\nBut I want real gains goddamnit. What's the best way to YOLO a cool 1000 and plunge face-deep into some tendies???
