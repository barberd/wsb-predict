Not for business disruptions, not for general account inquiries, not for any matter whatsoever. It's simply a document that states we have a phone line that customers can call.\"  \n\n\nMyself, I got a little more from the document than \"we have a phone line\", but then again I'm not a lawyer and I'm tired of dealing with RH so I'll just let the Short-seller's enrichment commission handle it ([SEC complaint form](https://www.sec.gov/oiea/Complaint.html))", "created_utc": 1583161975, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fcdfy2/robinhood_and_what_to_do_when_you_cant_do_anything/", "is_self": true}
