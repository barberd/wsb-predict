{"id": "hfq17g", "title": "DD: The market is going to keep going up", "selftext": "It's not that complicated. Stop pretending that the markets mean anything. There were only $12 trillion dollars to begin with in the entire world, and $7T was held by foreign institutions for international trade. The other $5T? Look at the sum of the wealth of all the rich peoples' wealth. DD on $x stock? It could go up, could go down. Rich people are trying to figure out where to stuff _$6 trillion_ extra dollars. And all of those junk bond purchases too. I don't know whether you guys or the professional bullshitter are more retarded at this point.\n\nMaybe you should go bet on a market that actually makes sense for a change? This way you can only lose $850 per trade instead of quintuple leveraging your life savings. What do you think the 6 month chart of this market means? Hmm?? https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/4683/Will-the-US-economy-hit-50-GDP-growth-by-year-end-2020\n\nStop posting 'DDs', it's all bullshit. The only thing the successful guys are doing right is predicting how rich assholes will move around their money on a roulette table. It's basically like knowing what someone's favorite numbers are. All of your DDs are bullshit, and they are probably more bullshit than the people on TV, because they're rich assholes.\n\n\n$6 trillion. It's not complicated. This is the only DD you will need for the rest of your short Adderall and cocaine filled lives. The only thing that could change the market's destiny is if China get pissed off and tries to fuck with the currency, which they will probably _never_ do, or Congress and Donnie fucking up the relief plans so much that everyone has to withdraw their 401k when the $600 supplemental runs out at the end of July. Go long $BREADLINES and stop thinking you can time the market with your retarded option plays.", "created_utc": 1593105413.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hfq17g/dd_the_market_is_going_to_keep_going_up/", "is_self": true}
