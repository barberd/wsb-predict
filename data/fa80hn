{"id": "fa80hn", "title": "There's always a bigger bear", "selftext": " Hello fellow autists,\n\nAfter  an examination of the current situation I have determined that the  United States is allowing the spread of COVID-19 unhindered in what is  either negligence or intentional misdirection. In very short order, many  new cases will appear throughout the US as local labs begin to test for  the virus. Before you screech in rage and hit that downvote button,  allow me to prove my point.\n\n1. The CDC stated that they would test \\~400 people by Feb 11 [https://web.archive.org/web/20200211050045/https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html](https://web.archive.org/web/20200211050045/https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html)\n2. The  current count is 445 people tested over TWO WEEKS after this date. This  means that they have only test 45 people in the last 2+ weeks. In  comparison, nearly 2.7 million airline passengers travel through the US  per day. [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html) \\- [https://www.faa.gov/air\\_traffic/by\\_the\\_numbers/](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/by_the_numbers/)\n3. The  CDC has very strict criteria limiting who can be tested for COVID-19.  This forces anyone else who fears they have the virus from getting  tested. [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/clinical-criteria.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/clinical-criteria.html)\n4. The  initial release stating that they only produced 200 test kits for the  US (and have not produced/made more available yet). Also note the  section saying these tests are only authorized for emergency use only.  These are not general testing kits. [https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/p0206-coronavirus-diagnostic-test-kits.html](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/p0206-coronavirus-diagnostic-test-kits.html)\n5. The  CDC test kits may not work properly - also note the quote from the CDC  director about how only a dozen state/local health departments are  capable of using these tests at the moment. The positive results must  then be confirmed by the CDC (another delay) before they are counted for  in the official numbers. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/02/25/cdc-coronavirus-test/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/02/25/cdc-coronavirus-test/)\n6. Tired of delays, labs are beginning to develop their own tests for the virus. [https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/02/24/world/asia/24reuters-china-health-usa-testing.html](https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/02/24/world/asia/24reuters-china-health-usa-testing.html)\n7. There  is no point in screening at airports due to the long incubation period.  Everyone they interact with in the meantime could become potentially  infected. [https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/02/26/airport-screeners-are-likely-missing-2-out-of-3-co.aspx](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/02/26/airport-screeners-are-likely-missing-2-out-of-3-co.aspx)\n8. Trump,  likely having just been advised about the situation has now put Pence  in charge. This way he saves face for the upcoming elections when it is  revealed how poorly the US has handled the outbreak situation. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia\\_pacific/coronavirus-china-live-updates/2020/02/26/f889693a-580e-11ea-9000-f3cffee23036\\_story.html](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/coronavirus-china-live-updates/2020/02/26/f889693a-580e-11ea-9000-f3cffee23036_story.html)\n9. As  I was writing this a new case has appeared in Northern California  without any contact related to infected countries. This is likely just  one of many active cases throughout the country that have not yet been  identified. [https://www.wired.com/story/community-spread-coronavirus/](https://www.wired.com/story/community-spread-coronavirus/)\n\nIn  conclusion, the virus could easily (and is very likely) running rampant  throughout the country under the guise of a common cough. In the coming  weeks the full extent of the infection will be revealed as more  travelers arrive from Europe and testing becomes more widespread.\n\nUnreasonable  levels of panic are likely to set in, and the market will once more  dip. Currently shorting airlines, travel companies, and companies whose  majority of business deals in international business with China.\n\nPanic is short lived however, and once everyone is infected - nobody is.\n\n\\#BearGang", "created_utc": 1582785556, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fa80hn/theres_always_a_bigger_bear/", "is_self": true}
