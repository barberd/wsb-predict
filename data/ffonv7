{"id": "ffonv7", "title": "The potential collapse of profits in Formula 1", "selftext": "The upcoming Formula 1 season starts in Melbourne next week. Given the global nature of F1, they usually race around the world, from Asia to Europe. \n\nSo what does the coronavirus entail for such a global sport? Cancellations. \n\nThe Chinese Grand Prix has already been cancelled, which was one of F1's biggest money makers (they fucking held the 1000th Grand Prix there last year, which was an absolute disaster). Moreover, it has just been announced that Bahrain GP which is the second round in the championship will be held behind closed doors (ie no spectators). This trend will most probably continue as governments cancel major events that feature a congregation of people. Ticket sales contribute to F1's profits, as well as to the general outlook for the sport. There is a high chance that more races may be cancelled/held behind closed doors in the coming weeks since the European corona crisis is just getting started. \n\nThe worst portion of all this is that 3 teams (Haas, Alpha Tauri and Ferrari) all fall under the Italian quarantine zone. Thus, even if 1 team drops out of the race, the F1 promoters (FOM) will have to pay heavy penalties to the track since tracks mandate at least 20 cars to start each race. This seems more and more likely as the situation in Italy worsens and countries are starting to issue bans/quarantine orders for individuals who have been in the infected areas in Italy. If even 1 member in any team gets the virus, all hell will break loose. \n\nSo what does this mean to all of us here at WSB? The potential of printing tendies all while we watch the races from our home. \n\nBuy puts on FWONA/FWONK that expire anytime end of this month/next. I'm not going to provide a specific position right now since I'll be buying my position at market open (will update with my position then). Choose positions that have relative low IV with respect to the market, and HOLD with diamond hands. The tendies will print sooner than later.\n\nEdit: There is also another huge potential scandal sweeping through the sport which involves one of its biggest teams, Ferrari, in a cheating row. 7 of the 10 teams are up in arms, furious about what is/has happened. This will have an overarching impact on the new concorde agreement (profit sharing agreement within the teams) that is to be signed this year for the upcoming seasons.", "created_utc": 1583725322.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffonv7/the_potential_collapse_of_profits_in_formula_1/", "is_self": true}
