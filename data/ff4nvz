So to pass the time i am offering some free TA. on anything you guys suggest. Spit out some random letters that make a ticker and ill tell you what the charts look like to me.\n\nAs always do your own DD and im not responsible for whatever positions you may possible take off some random dude on the internet.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the suggestions. Sorry to all the people i didnt get to. I did my best but that is as many as i have the tolerance to do. Remember cause of the sheer quantity of posts i tried to go as fast as possible and get as many as i could which can lead to me missing some info, but regardless i feel pretty confident with my replies. Wishing everyone some tendies fresh out the oven. GL ", "created_utc": 1583628521.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ff4nvz/free_ta_no_bs/", "is_self": true}
