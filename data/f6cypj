Preferably something that has already depreciated massively. \n\nCopart has auctions worldwide, a new one is opening in Germany. \n\nMany of the cars and trucks are salvage, but you can get insane deals on Lambo's Ferrari's and Bentley, if that's your thing. \n\nThey also charge a massive amount in fees. Here's an example of the fee structure of a car I purchased. \n\n11/14/2019 SALE PRICE 3,250.00\n11/20/2019 HAZ MAT COMPLIANCE 10.00\n11/14/2019 BUYER FEE 400.00\n11/14/2019 INTERNET BID FEE 79.00\n11/14/2019 GATE 59.00\n11/14/2019 SALES TAX 406.21\n11/20/2019 COPART MAILING FEE 20.00 COPART MAILING FEE\n11/20/2019 STORAGE 5.00 FROM 11/19/19 - 11/19/19\n11/21/2019 LATE PAYMENT 50.00\n11/20/2019 STORAGE 10.00 FROM 11/20/19 - 11/20/19\n11/20/2019 SALES TAX 16.91- Secured Funds Adjustment\n11/21/2019 STORAGE 15.00 FROM 11/21/19 - 11/21/19\n11/21/2019 BUYER PAYMENT 15.00-\n11/20/2019 BUYER PAYMENT 4,272.30-\nNET DUE (USD) .00 Paid Through: 11/21/19\n\nAs you can see, I paid almost 20% of the cars value in fees, yet its still worth it. \n\nThey always beat earnings. Insurance companies need a way to get rid of cars in accidents to recoup salvage value. This company will always have business. \n\nEarnings after close today\n\nCPRT is the ticker.", "created_utc": 1582129079, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6cypj/autist_car_auction_cprt/", "is_self": true}
