Please help.", "selftext": "In the AH on Friday, I started getting popups on RH alert that it purchased 1000 shares of BIIB on my behalf. To my surprise, my trade history with BIIB is absolute zero - never placed any orders, never traded any calls/puts, no short orders to close, nothing at all. What's more puzzling is that my buying power on Friday was just below $1000 and I'm not even on Robinhood gold or margin account, its a simple cash account.\n\nThere were no signs that my account was hacked, no suspicious new bank account added, no shares sold on my behalf. I just don't know how in the world would someone or RH even execute that order that surpasses my buying power by several orders of magnitudes.\n\nI emailed them on Friday evening but hey, its RH and they only have a weekday support.\n\nHas this happened to anybody else?\n\nEDIT: Can't sell it first thing in the morning because I got a Reg T call and my account is restricted.\n\nEDIT 2: I'm not bullshitting.
