AMD has been dropping HARD these past 2 days but that doesnt mean that AMD is going to be a dead company, last month AMD faced this exact situation but after about 4 days it was able to stabilize and shoot back to the moon, meaning that AMD can actually only go up kiddos. If y'all aren't stocking up on AMD calls like how us real men will be waiting at gamestop at midnight for the 3/20 release of Animal Crossing New Horizons on the Nintendo Switch, have fun living the rest of your life in your moms basement. Now that ive sent my message out, ill see yall bitches in orbit next week and have a wonderful weekend :))", "created_utc": 1582309619, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7fbbc/amdfree_tendies/", "is_self": true}
