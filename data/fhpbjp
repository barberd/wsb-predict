{"id": "fhpbjp", "title": "Conversation I had with my finance prof", "selftext": "An activist \"investor\" professor with a diversified portfolio was teaching a class on Jim Cramer, a known diversifier.\n\n\"Before the class begins, you must get on your knees and worship Jeff Bezos and accept that he was the most enlightened CEO the world has ever known, even greater than Richard D. Fain!\"\n\nAt this moment, I, a brave student who had invested all his student loans into royal caribbean cruises ltd as leverage stood up and held up a dollar.\n\n\"What is the best way to make a return on this dollar?\"\n\nThe arrogant professor smirked quite investorly and smugly replied \"With proper diversification of course you stupid single stock investor\"\n\n\"Wrong. This dollar belongs to royal caribbean cruises ltd. This one dollar will turn into a trillion once royal caribbean cruises ltd succeeds in taking over the world government. If diversification really is the safe strategy, where will your money go when royal caribbean cruises ltd forcefully takes over every single industry?.\"\n\nThe professor was visibly shaken, and dropped his chalk and DVD of Mad Money with Jim Cramer. He stormed out of the room crying those diversified portfolio crocodile tears. \n\nThe students applauded and all bought stock in royal caribbean cruises ltd. An eagle named \"Symphony of the Seas\" flew into the room and perched atop the royal caribbean cruises ltd logo and shed a tear on the chalk. The royal caribbean cruises ltd investor report was read out loud several times, and Royal Genie himself showed up and crafted a one of a kind cruise experience for all of the new shareholders in royal caribbean cruises ltd.\n\nThe professor lost his tenure and was made homeless. He was loaded onto a ship of royal caribbean cruises ltd and made to walk the plank in the middle of the Atlantic ocean.", "created_utc": 1584053448.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhpbjp/conversation_i_had_with_my_finance_prof/", "is_self": true}
