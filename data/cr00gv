You are financially responsible for anything you do.***\n\nLets see how accurate this is going to be a week or two from now, this will be my last post for a while:  \n\nI don't know what will happen tomorrow, but Monday has a good chance of a gap down. If price gets near the lows and even blasts through them, It might get bearish for a day or two. The bears will dive in, and the bulls will really be on the back foot.  IF this happens, I will buy between 280-278 and ride it to about 300.  There should be a sudden price rise, perhaps it will even be caused by the FED again like in June when I did this trade last time. The bulls will be unable to get in so quickly as they are still too scared, just like last time. The bears will have to pay up hard as price explodes higher.  By the time I am selling, the bulls should then be getting in.  This should all happen before the end of the month. \n\nThe last time I did this trade the SPY was at 270s and I sold near 290s within about a week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Short tl;dr version:**\n\n1. Monday gaps down lower (not that important)\n2. I will buy a red candle especially at 280-278\n3. The market will explode and no one believe the move.\n4. SPY will be at or very near 300 EoM.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I WILL ANSWER QUESTIONS IF YOU HAVE ANY.**", "created_utc": 1565922451, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cr00gv/specific_spy_300_end_of_month_scenario_i_will/", "is_self": true}
