How far this is reliable", "selftext": "Copied from Barron's site =&gt;  \n\n**It Looks Like the Fed Will Cut Interest Rates in October After All**\n\nA quarter-point interest-rate cut will be back on the table at the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee at the end of the month, according to the latest indications from the Treasury and futures markets.\n\nWith the stock market sharply lower Wednesday for the second straight session\u2014following the previous day\u2019s report of a much weaker-than-expected reading on the manufacturing sector from the Institute for Supply Management\u2014the federal-funds futures market placed a 76.4% probability on the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy-setting panel lowering its target for federal funds by 25 basis points (one-quarter percentage point) from the current 1.75%\u20132% range, according to the CME FedWatch website.\n\nAt the beginning of the week, the futures market put less than a 40% probability of a cut at the Oct. 29-30 FOMC meeting. The more likely policy path, according to the fed-funds futures market, had been for one more rate cut this year, though not until the Dec. 10-11 confab.\n\nBut that was before the ISM factory gauge for September was reported as 47.8, farther below the 50 reading that denotes the dividing line between manufacturing expansion and contraction, and which had been economists\u2019 median forecast.\n\nIn the Treasury market, the yield on the two-year note\u2014the maturity most sensitive to Fed rate expectations\u2014is down sharply at midday Wednesday at 1.50%. That\u2019s off 16 basis points from Tuesday\u2019s early levels, prior to the release of the weak ISM report, which has since reverberated through global equity markets.\n\nThe benchmark 10-year note yields 1.60%, down 14 basis points from its pre-ISM levels and at its lowest level since Sept. 6.\n\nThe yield curve\u2014as measured by the difference between the three-month Treasury bill and the 10-year note\u2014has become slightly less negatively sloped. The spread between those two maturities has narrowed to minus 18.5 basis points from minus 20.2 basis points before the ISM release Tuesday morning, reflecting the increased expectations of Fed easing.\n\nBut that is failing to give a lift to financial stocks. The Financial Select Sector SPDR exchange-traded fund (ticker: XLF) is down 1.7% at midday and down 4% from a week earlier. The benefit to financials from a slightly less inverted yield curve is being swamped by effects from fears of a further economic slowdown. The Industrial Select SPDR ETF (XLI), which is sensitive to the outlook for growth, is down even more sharply, off 2.3% at midday.", "created_utc": 1570389317, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/de7ux0/rate_cut_again_how_far_this_is_reliable/", "is_self": true}
