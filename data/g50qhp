They announce AH Tuesday from their hobo shack next to the Santa Monica Pier. This time the angle isn't EPS. It's guidance. Snap is only able to provide guidance 90 days at a time so they will announcing Q2.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SNAP/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SNAP/)\n\nHandy Dandy link to Yahoo Finance, I'm not walking you through it if you can't be fucked to check the Yahoo Finance of what you're investing in Jesus probably wouldn't approve but here we are.\n\nSo, let's start from the top, the valuation. Roughly 20B in market cap, trading 11X trailing Revenue (1.7B FYE19). For the uninitiated that's a lot. Now that's not ALWAYS a bad thing, if you're working on the cure for cancer that you can sell for ten dollars of Cost of Goods Sold, yeah I'm going to invest in your company at 11X earnings.\n\nHere's the prob:\n\n[https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/4/16/saupload\\_52891963f6f0e51423b16ee80b7d51d6.png](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/4/16/saupload_52891963f6f0e51423b16ee80b7d51d6.png)\n\nThey are WAY overpriced by this metric compared to Peers, and it isn't even warranted. They have rising competition in form of TikTok (notably PINS, TWTR etc.. do not have established rivals in their space)  They have significantly worse margins than their Peers as well. (The SA article where the pic comes from does a good job going into detail).\n\nSNAP has been losing money for a long time, in fact since ever. They have never been profitable. So why are they worth 11X trailing revenue? **Revenue GROWTH**. Their share price growth has been fueled by consistent revenue growth every Q (and the two Qs that put into question revenue growth KILLED share price). Keep in mind, despite all of this growth, they are nowhere near being a true EPS entity, they need to kill it for a LONG time to get to revenue high enough to generate earnings.\n\nQ2 guidance will be a poison pill for SNAP because of how fucking bad it will be. Why is that?\n\n**The underlying nature of their advertising contracts. (which make up all of their revenue)**\n\nIf you decide to peruse their 2019 10-K, Snap actually does a great job disclosing the nature of their customer ad contracts. Snapchat virtually only engages in short term deals to sell ad space. It makes sense, customers aren't comfortable making long term commitments to a platform like SNAP, they are fresh to the scene. They usually run \"promos\" where they sell heavily discounted ad space to get people in the door. They actually take careful note (probably because their auditors are assholes) that advertising revenue can be extremely volatile and that clients are generally quick to pull business from new players like Snap since the value isn't quite clear yet.\n\nSnapchat of course knows this. They are scared shitless and have been trying to frame the narrative:\n\n[https://seekingalpha.com/news/3557548-snapchat-touts-engagement-boosts-in-march](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3557548-snapchat-touts-engagement-boosts-in-march)\n\nThis sentiment has brought SNAP's share price from $10 at the bottom a month ago to $13 where it sits today. ($19 pre beerflu). More engagement = more revenue right? SNAP knows all eyes are going to be on their guidance. They know ADUs will be mostly flat and projected ARPU will be a disaster since most their growth is being generated on that front.\n\n**The Best fucking part.**\n\nI think what really binds a lot of bearish DD here is the that we're all dealing with shit that has already tanked in one way or another, we're all looking to piss on the grave of some company that's on it's way out. You may be thinking that since the drop from 19 --> 13 that's exactly what we're doing here. We're not. Check the 1 Year. This piece of shit was at 5 fucking dollars a share after everyone was sick of it's unprofitable shit in Jan 2019. It's been a TEAR since because of what again?\n\nRevenue growth. Join in for the earnings call on Tuesday to discover exactly how much revenue growth they think they have in store for Q2. The only reason I even thought of this play is because a hedge fund just took a massive short position recently on a rumour that 90% of their revenue essentially evaporated overnight. You don't need to buy that rumour but you should understand that SNAP has HUGE headwinds in their revenue growth story up ahead, and that's horrible news to a PRE-EPS company like them.\n\nI'll update with what the DPI activity was once it gets posted for Monday, if I had to guess Gamma Exposure and DIX tanked today.\n\nEDIT: A lot of 10,11, and 12p Expiring this Friday, (like probably too much but w/e)\n\nCredit KO Below for the tl:dr \" snap is gay and has 0 value, change my mind \"", "created_utc": 1587415060.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g50qhp/snapchat_inc_aka_micheal_burry_simulator_2020_its/", "is_self": true}
