{"id": "fe74vu", "title": "$LYV is about to go full t**s up", "selftext": "TLDR; Buy the f*** out of puts on $LYV (live nation). Expire anytime after 03/27 (spring break announcements. (*EASY*)\n-\n\nSo I know y'all don't like to read so i'm going to keep it as short as possible. \n\nTLDR about my credibility (*MEDIUM*):\n-\n I work with large companies, events, entertainment and HEAR a lot from idiot employees OF said companies. \n**I'm not stating I have information that is unknown to the public. I just know how these events work. The safety and government interaction behinds these events is insane and you don't even see it.**\n\n\nHow will they suffer? (If you can read *(HARD)*)\n-\nLive Nation own's a ton of venues. The company's income is directly from the entertainment industry. The unfortunate part for them? It's GIANT venues, in the most crowded places in the U.S. Public safety and police involvement in not optional. It's regulated by law and controlled by state/government. \n\nThere's going to be a ton of cancellations, like really soon, reallly soon. Spring Break happens from the 14th-27th of march, (hint the no earlier than expiration for max gains). Huge groups are announcing cancellations ahead of time. (I've seen it in my own industry, you've seen it in the news.). LIVE NATION DOESN'T HAVE A MASS AMOUNT OF EVENTS SOON BUT IT'S MORE THAN THAT. \n\nSpring Break cancellations will SHOOT this issue up. We've gone from the steps of international troubles, to supply chain yata yata yata. What's been massively missed? Internal entertainment and mass crowds. The entertainment industry has a massive red dildo about to be shot up (down?) its ass. Also, people are going to be holding onto their money (see 2008). The spending on entertainment is directly related to the economy, we're going down folks. \n\nThe government is closely working with these groups (CDC) and trying to suppress as much public panic as long as possible. They're trying to minimize damage. They want to stall as long as possible. It's really bad. I've personally seen a TON of events cancelled. \n\n\nInformational Links for the curious that want more reassurance on why i'm so confident.\n\n- https://www.livenation.com/#upcoming (All their venues and upcoming event's, it's a ton).\n- https://www.musicfestivalwizard.com/festival-type/live-nation/ (A visual example of how big festivals are, rock and rio generates 1.8B for the city).\n\n- https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/touring/9323647/concerts-canceled-coronavirus-list (Live nation starting the cancellations). \n\n- https://help.livenation.com/s/article/What-happens-if-my-event-is-canceled?language=en_US (Live natins refund policy sends full refunds, everyone with tickets is entitled to full reimbursement if they've purchased before cancel, RIP profits).\n\nEDIT: -\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2020/3/6/21162247/sxsw-2020-cancelled-coronavirus-austin-texas-virus-fears-public-health-event        \n\nsxsw has been cancelled.
