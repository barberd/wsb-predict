{"id": "cq1nha", "title": "Long LYFT, short UBER, make 30%. Quick and dirty DD.", "selftext": "Both of these companies lose a lot of money, that goes without saying. Personally I think the economics of this business look reasonably good over the very long term, but in the meantime more revenue = more losses and that's not a way to run a business.\n\nLYFT trades at 6.1x sales vs. Uber at 5.9x sales. Is this premium justified? Well seeing as LYFT is growing at 60% and UBER at 18%, well... absolutely fucking yes. For P/S parity to exist in 1 year, LYFT stock must outperform UBER by 30%.\n\nSo is this a simple and dirty 30% return? Yes, it is.\n\nBut LYFT is a much better company in other ways, too. While UBER's losses mount, LYFT has actually turned the corner already, and 2019 will be less of a money losing year than 2018.\n\nLYFT is managed by its founder CEO and has emerged from nothing to become a formidable competitor. A better managed company over time.\n\nOn the earnings call, when that Uber exec ripped into De Blasio as being a chode, LYFT gave a measured response.\n\nLYFT is a good brand and has always had a better idea about how to do business. They innovated on driver tipping, and purple lights in the car, and probably on other things too.\n\nSo it's simple... buy LYFT and short UBER. One is just far better than the other, no ifs ands or buts.", "created_utc": 1565740613, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cq1nha/long_lyft_short_uber_make_30_quick_and_dirty_dd/", "is_self": true}
