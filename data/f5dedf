{"id": "f5dedf", "title": "Some basic tools for your toolkit so you stop losing money on expired options", "selftext": "Since it's a holiday and we're all bored anyway I'm going to give you some *very* basic things to think about before you open a position. Who am I? I'm just a random dude with some business and finance education. I have had limited success and failures (over the past two years I've been up 90% and down 60%), but the key is that I *haven't cashed out of the game yet*. So, if you're looking for ways to justify your gambling addiction, read on. If you want to be the one retard who learns something today and not the 9 retards posting stupid shit in the comments, read on.\n\nToday I've picked a nice mix of glaring WSB faults and interesting things:\n\n1. Risk and reward expectations\n2. Stock and Options packages (ETFs and multilegs)\n3. Research aka Due diligence (DD)\n\nLet's dive in friendos!\n\n**Risk and reward expectations** \\- Generally investment managers, financiers, and traders gauge their performance for a quarter or year based on how they did **relative to the market**. So if the S&amp;P 500 only grows 6% in a year, a trader is successful if they made 9% gain that year. If the S%P 500 grows 20% like in 2019, you could literally just park your money in stocks and sell a year later for 20% gain, no skill involved. **Historically, the market has grown 10%** ***a year.*** I mention this in bold because most newcomers here really need to have their risk/reward expectations reframed. Usually the rewards are directly related to the risk that you lose everything. Doubling your money with a yolo call position is *incredibly risky and you are likely to lose all of your money*. This isn't a bear/bull thing (which is fucking stupid anyway. Imagine gambling/investing based on a fucking animal mascot). Pouring your money into shares of an S&amp;P 500 index is much more safe and likely to preserve your money. I think there is a big contingent of big brained smarties on this board who want much more risk and reward than buying shares, but don't want to fuck in the dark on WSB meme options. If you are ok making 5-10% a week instead of 5-10% a year, read on.\n\n**Stock and options packages** \\- Stocks get packaged up by companies and resold to you in two ways: mutual funds and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). These are pretty much the same thing - a bundle of stocks that you buy into - except ETFs are... exchange-traded aka sold as shares. Why do companies do this? To hedge against the risk we talked about before!\n\nWe need to digress for a second into different kinds of risk. If you had 0 toleration for risk, if you wanted a virtual guarantee of not losing money, how can you invest? You can buy **US Treasury bonds.** The rate of return on US treasury bonds is literally called *the risk-free rate* in finance and is about 1.6%/year or something right now. Pitiful. In our desire to see bigger returns *we must take on bigger risks.* There is **firm specific risk** related to the operations and financing of a specific firm ($BABA, $MSFT, $ADI). Let's say we didn't want to deal with this risk. We just want to take advantage of their growth of an industry, sector, or the market as a whole, without getting burned by the mistakes of any one individual firm. Then we can *diversify away* *firm-specific risk* and deal only with **market risk** by purchasing shares of every company in an industry, sector, or market. So State Street Global Advisors purchases a weighted average of the S&amp;P 500 and sells that package to you as $SPY. Any one success or failure in the S&amp;P 500 doesn't make SPY move much; it moves the way the market moves in general.\n\nOk, so, there are indexes/ETFs for everything. Whole market, biotech, manufacturing, industrial power, you name it. These are incredibly successful products - $SPY, $TQQQ, $PEY - because they are less risky and move slower than the individual stocks in the funds. What's the deal with options packages? **Options packages hedge risk in exchange for lower returns and are available on Robinhood (but never take the pre-built offered packages)**. Take a second at this point to go to investopedia and get a handle on spreads - you'll see things like Bull/Bear Put/Call credit/debit spread.\n\nSo let's say you have a belief that $MSFT is going up, but you don't want to *risk* everything on straight calls that could expire worthless in a week. You have some *options* (pun intended). You can reduce your risk by changing the rules - open a *bull put (credit) spread* so that you don't need $MSFT to go up, you just need it to not go down. Or you can lower the cost of your calls (and the reward) by opening a *bull call (debit) spread.* What I love about these is that the only cost/collateral RH requires is that difference between strikes in a spread. For instance, I have a SPY bull put spread right now with strikes at 330 and 329 - RH required $100 in collateral and gave me 12 dollars credit when I opened it (the difference between selling to open the 330 put and buying to open the 329 put), and I think I can close it out this week for a cost of 5 dollars, netting me 7$ on my 100. That doesn't sound flashy except that *7% a week is literally rich people insaneo gains on a relatively safe bet.* If you've read this far, my secret volatility play this week is opening a condor tomorrow on $ADI and closing it after earnings. EPS is estimated to be pretty low, but the firm's operating cycle is absolutely solid, so I think it'll move sideways on the news and we're going to make money on the IV crush. $1 spreads on the low and high ends, with strikes roughly 6% out of the money. Open it for 30 bucks credit tomorrow, close it for 15 bucks debit on Thursday.\n\n**Due Diligence** \\- DD is more art than science, and it's going to look different for stocks than for options, but in either case often the only difference between sweating nervously for a week while you look for a way to not lose so much, and relaxing confidently in your purchase, is 15 minutes of research. **The price of a share is related to the performance of the firm, even in 2020.** If you're trying to do DD on a specific firm as an amatuer, you want to look at 3 things - Quarterly/annual reports of earnings, analyst opinions, and the sector as a whole. Let's take $MSFT for example: Big revenue growth each year for the past decade, analysts say that Azure and Teams are solid products, and the tech sector is growing, so there's room for $MSFT to go up without having to take market share from competitors. That info took me 5 minutes to find, and with it I'm very confident that purchasing shares of $MSFT is a good idea. You can usually go to a company's website to find their financial information in a government tax filing form called a 10-k, but that can be pretty dense. You're looking for a page called the Balance Sheet.\n\nAnyway, hope you had a good read and learned something. If not, fuck off and lose all your money and disappear unnoticed in a few weeks like 99% of the people on this board.", "created_utc": 1581965092, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f5dedf/some_basic_tools_for_your_toolkit_so_you_stop/", "is_self": true}
