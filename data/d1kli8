Yet the bond market has been trading its '22 debt at or above par recently. Recent positive news includes:\n\n\\- sale of non-core business\n\n\\- upward EPS revision\n\n\\- very detailed buyout rumor at roughly double the avg share price over the past 2 weeks: [https://twitter.com/JonathanWexler3/status/1164205831904256000](https://twitter.com/JonathanWexler3/status/1164205831904256000).\n\n\\- partnership with the NFL:  [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190903005193/en/Tailored-Brands-Enters-Licensed-Collaboration-NFL](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190903005193/en/Tailored-Brands-Enters-Licensed-Collaboration-NFL)  \"We are excited to work with Tailored Brands,\u201d said Michelle Micone, Senior Vice President of Consumer Products of the National Football League, \u201cand offer our fans something **they\u2019ve long been asking for** through a licensing agreement with brands who continue to be recognized as **the industry leaders in men\u2019s custom clothing**.\u201d \n\nThis is important for several reasons. \n\n1) The NFL is hinting there is strong market demand for this product. Marketing hasn't even begun, but by the end of this NFL season, you can expect that every fan will know about the next coming of Men's Wearhouse and JAB. This is important because all the deep value models pre-NFL-partnership had TLRD valued much higher than its current value, but **assumed decreasing sales**.\n\nThere's now a good chance that sales will actually increase in the near-future thanks to the exclusive NFL partnership, and any other partnerships that may come down the pipe. If you plug growing sales into these models, a ten bagger is not out of the question.\n\n**Remember, 33%-50% of Americans call themselves NFL fans.**\n\n2) Despite all the chatter on the fashion snob pockets of the internet, Men's Wearhouse and JAB are still recognized by mainstream America as the leaders in formalwear. This hints that TLRD will likely form more partnerships with major sports leagues, and they are the **only** company with enough market power and street cred to get these kinds of deals. In Warren Buffett parlance, they are growing their moat.\n\n\\---\n\n**What about the bear case?**\n\n\\- Workplace casual is going to kill TLRD...right? Well, no. The workplace casual trend has been in play for over a decade now, and yet MW sales have had periods of significant growth throughout this period. This is clear evidence that the workplace is not the dominant factor in MW sales. There will always be weddings, black tie events, funerals, proms, lawyers, bar mitzvahs, etc.\n\n\\- Men's Wearhouse is lame compared to \\[insert fashion snob's preferred suit retailer here\\]. There are two problems with this. First, most American men are not fashion snobs. When you subtract the population of fashion snobs from the population of American men, you still have a huge population that needs suits.\n\nSecond, Men's Wearhouse has a high-quality line of **made-in-America** suits by Joseph Abboud, who even the fashion snobs agree, have quality that stands up to the trendier suit makers. And in today's political climate, you cannot underestimate the power of made-in-America.", "created_utc": 1567995144, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d1kli8/tlrd_100_in_a_year/", "is_self": true}
