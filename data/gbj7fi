{"id": "gbj7fi", "title": "CHNG call buying today.", "selftext": "Hello, hello, you may remember me from last time when may have lost you a bit of money with PFE unusual options activity.  Some were smart, though, and got out with a little dough. Also, don't confuse me with the other guy. He has a proprietary algo or something, I just look at barchart and decide what's up.\n\nThis morning lots of buying of 15 may 20 12c. Done in lots of 150, as of now a total of 35k spent on these things. CHNG earnings will probably be at or around the 15th, which makes these seem less like earning bets. (You don't typically hold options to expiration, bc theta). The relatively small size of this bet makes it feel less like institutional fuckers and more like some guy with 35k who wants to double his money based on some inside info. Or maybe we're all being fucked with by some guy who has fuck you money and can spend 35k on a joke.", "created_utc": 1588343703.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gbj7fi/chng_call_buying_today/", "is_self": true}
