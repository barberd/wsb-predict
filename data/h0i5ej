{"id": "h0i5ej", "title": "Buy RVs $LAZYW", "selftext": "**TLDR**  \nLong Lazydays RV warrants (Ticker: LAZYW)\n\nThis is a leveraged play on the RV retailer Lazydays (ticker: LAZY). These are warrants (same as options) that give you the right to purchase the common stock (LAZY) through March 2023.  \n\n**Let me make this easy for you**  \nIf LAZY stock doubles from $8.50 to $17, these LAZYW warrants are worth $2.75 (8x your money from current LAZYW price).  If LAZY triples to $24, these LAZYW warrants are worth $6.25 (18x your $).  Lazydays issued a press release today stating that their orders in May 2020 are up 90% relative to May 2019\n\n\n\n**Thesis**  \nIf you are old/have a pre-existing condition but want to go on vacation this summer you're going to avoid nasty AIRBNB's and the jail cell that is the modern day airplane. Instead, you're going to buy your own RV and cruise around, cook your own food, and not worry about the arrogant american who previously stayed in your hotel room that didn't wash their hands once during their visit.\n\n**Leverage**  \nMany of you will remember PRPLW being pitched on here. Those are up 5-10x depending on when purchased. LAZYW is a warrant as well - and its cheaper. Warrants are the same shit as an option... only difference is it is issued by the company instead of by the market - and in this case extremely advantageous because of the long maturity date which options usually don't provide. These mature in March 2023 - which means these have almost 3 years until expiration - significantly longer than the exposure most options will give you. The strike price is $11.50. For those who know how to read, the specific mechanics are that LAZYW gives the right to purchase 1/2 share of LAZY through March 2023, capped at a ceiling of $24 LAZY.\nIf LAZY hits $17, these are worth $2.75 (8x upside). If LAZY hits $24, these are worth $6.25 (18x upside)\n\n**Todays press release**  \nLazydays issued a press release today stating that their orders in May 2020 are up 90% relative to May 2019.

This is not investment advise. Do your own research. I reserve the right to buy/sell LAZYW without updating this thread (i.e. I have a life - be thankful you were blessed with this).
