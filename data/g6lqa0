It's next month and June contracts for WTI light sweet crude go negative right before expiry just like this month, because all those storages that were filled to capacity are still just as full. I load up on 1000 contracts and get paid millions of dollars to hold them. At this point two things can happen:\n\nScenario 1: Prices go up, and I sell all my contracts to make additional millions on top of what I was paid to buy them\n\nScenario 2: Prices go down and I can't exit my position without paying someone else even more money, which I can't do because I have no money. Now I am responsible for taking delivery of a million barrels of oil, which I also can't do. I get sued and declare bankruptcy.\n\nBut bankruptcy isn't a problem, because I am already worth $0. So this is a situation where I either become an oil millionaire, or lose nothing and stay broke.\n\nWhy is this not a 1000 IQ play for someone who already has no assets?", "created_utc": 1587644846.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6lqa0/making_lots_of_when_oil_futures_go_negative_again/", "is_self": true}
