It is not really WSB material but i know here i will get best advice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo i had IBKR cash account with 200K USD.\n\napplied for margin account, it was approved. \n\nNow, buying power is 800K USD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will not trade options. Only stock.\n\nHow much should i spend now to buy stock, if i plan to sell same day? How much if i have to keep it overnight?\n\nCan i now buy 600K USD of, lets say, BA, and hold it long? How much the stock would need to drop before the guys start liquidating my shares.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs there some special exotic rule i should be aware of? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks guys!", "created_utc": 1554989648, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bbzxln/help_me_clarify_margin_account_buying_power/", "is_self": true}
