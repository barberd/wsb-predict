EWJ $42p 3/27 EWJ $42p 4/17** \n\n**PLAN A) CDC's WORSE CASE SCENARIO HAPPENS:** The US continues to shit the bed, Millions infected, 0.5-1M die, and the coronavirus continues to be a big enough issue on social gatherings that the IOC or Japan say sorry bois, we gotta cancel.\n\n**PLAN B) THE NBA EFFECT:** So the NBA season is pushed back a minimum of 30 days. I foresee the players, owners, and all financial interests (casinos, sponsors, Nike, etc) in the NBA not wanting to lose all of their regular season games, but they may settle on aborting the regular season. If they jump straight to the playoffs, all the bubble teams fighting for playoff spots are going to complain, as well as lots of lost revenue for all parties for every game that is skipped. Teams have already been pursuing extensions with their arenas to ensure they can schedule games into the summer months. **American companies stand to make much more from the NBA season than the Olympics.** If the playoffs are pushed back a month, they are going to have the world's best players for the USA, Spain, Australia and all the other countries busy with the NBA playoffs, making the basketball events insignificant. And **NBC is going to have to fight for ratings with ABC covering the NBA playoffs/Finals.**\n\n**PLAN C) OLYMPIC TRIALS:** But u/thaddeuscastle, the Olympics are not until July, and I think the NBA will still figure their shit out before then, or the IOC just won't care about losing one event?!  Currently olympic trial season should be going on around the world. Last week, Atlanta hosted the US marathon trial pre-corona. Now many olympic trial events are being postponed, the upcoming ones are facing cancelation threats, and basically the timeline will be absolutely crunched when the trials could be rescheduled. Not to mention that other sports leagues are going to have more than normal conflict (Soccer = Top Teir Club Leagues PPD, Baseball = MLB PPD, Golf = The Masters PPD, Tennis, etc). Usually big name players skip olympics if there is conflict anyway, but  anyways for the top tier league play anyways, so no big deal.   \n\n\nSo there you go, three contingency plans that would all point to the Olympics being postponed, moved, or canceled. Puts on EWJ. Less contract vig than individual Japan-exposed stocks. Also, consider CMCSA (NBC/Comcast).", "created_utc": 1584216315.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fioknu/a_short_of_olympic_proportions_discuss/", "is_self": true}
