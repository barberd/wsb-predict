Improvise, adapt, and overcome!", "selftext": "Disclaimer: I\u2019m a degenerate who likes looking at graphs and has a gambling addiction (and uses RH)\n\nHi, it's me again. If you think I am a gay retard and made you upset bc you can\u2019t read feel free to give me a pride award, it\u2019ll be an honour. If I helped you make tendies, donate somewhere.\n\nFirst of all, I must say thank you to all the people who I got the awards from, means a lot to me to be valued by this autistic community.\n\nBy no means should people blindly follow my advice! I am a degenerate myself and am relatively new to this. Not many of you have big brains, but even just a couple of cells should be sufficient to make your own decisions.\n\n***What happened yesterday?***\n\nThe market was very uncertain during the last 45 minutes of the day and until last 2 minutes, the 15min candle was closing on red which was a signal to buy puts according to my retarded TA. Very, unfortunately, things took an interesting turn and the candle turned red.\n\nAfter the market closed Trump fucked everyone up by suspending travelling and bullshiting yet again (maybe he got beer flu himself, who knows), as a result, the stonks went down.\n\n***What did I do yesterday?***\n\nFor those who wondered and haven't read the updated in my post. Since the last candle was likely going to be green I have sent an order to buy puts, but thanks to our wonderful cocksucker Robinhood, the order wasn\u2019t filled in time and I was left tendieless( Yes, I know, I need to switch to another platform. Will do as soon as I can.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vp52o4xh09m41.png?width=1450&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cfcdd7af1ee54afaa2f6a1289a9be57042e2c5c\n\n***What\u2019s to do next?***\n\nIf you still want my advice here we go. I am still sticking to my strategy today and if this time if the market is closing with *3 consistent green 15minute candles*, I\u2019ll reverse their action. I will try to submit an order earlier and not get fucked again (in case if I buy calls and the market does indeed go up in the morning I will sell right away, can't hold calls for long in this market). Why could it bounce back temporarily? Well, no one knows, but fed could step in and do something, just like on Tuesday when SPY rose overnight. Another reason is that people might've oversold this morning.\n\nPlease be careful and don\u2019t fully rely on my thoughts, they are just thoughts and I don\u2019t mind to yolo my own money. We are in a bull market and SPY is a lot more likely to go down than up on a given day, so be careful and thoughtful with your actions. We are in a legendary period of time when it is quite easy to make money due to the volatility, just don\u2019t be retarded.\n\nI am expecting the SPY to go up right before the end of the day on Friday and if it does I will buy puts. If it doesn\u2019t I\u2019ll still buy puts, we\u2019re in a bear market fuckers!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR**: We\u2019re all fucked, tell your family you love them and make good use of this bear market, literally any SPY puts further than 3 weeks away and hold until Monday.\n\nLink to yesterday's post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fh1ney/back\\_with\\_spy\\_predictions/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fh1ney/back_with_spy_predictions/)", "created_utc": 1584022188.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhgwga/spy_titanic_improvise_adapt_and_overcome/", "is_self": true}
