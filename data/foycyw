{"id": "foycyw", "title": "WSB Research Crew Recruiting Announcement", "selftext": "Hey, guys. I posted that [stupid DD post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fe5s7e/the_fed_repos_are_an_attempt_to_prop_up_the/) a few weeks ago about the repo market and international liquidity. As promised, we've begun collaborating on research into potential plays to make, with our focus being primarily on identifying vehicles (like CEFs and ETFs) for betting against at-risk industries (oil, travel, healthcare, tech, et cetera).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe've hopped platforms a few times (between a github, gdoc, notion, two discords...) and we've found a permanent home on Microsoft Teams.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrently looking for perhaps a dozen or so very motivated individuals to participate in this project. The teams I've split the group into are as follows: Fundamentals, Technicals, Macro, and Developers. Currently, our dev team is working on building a scraper for the SEC EDGAR engine - it would be really helpful if they had a little more... help, especially from someone with past experience working with the EDGAR engine. Technicals has been predicting the market and setting up indicators for identified targets. Fundamentals has been working with the Dev team to define parameters for organizing data. Macro guys have been aggregating the reporting on the market and on COVID updates.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe've got a handful of people working with us who've posted some of the best DDs you guys've come to love over the past few weeks, including Taxation\\_is\\_theft and Variation-separate. Our Fundamentals team has access to Bloomberg information.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe just need more boots on the ground, and more active, dedicated members.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, I'm just throwing this out here to see what bites we get. DM or chat me with your background, interests, and goals, and we can discuss inviting you to the Teams platform.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCheers, guys.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nu/theycallmeryan hey approve this\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: forgot how fast shit blows up on this sub. I'll begin answering your DMs and chats around 730 EST. Thanks for the interest, guys, keep it coming.", "created_utc": 1585170728.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/foycyw/wsb_research_crew_recruiting_announcement/", "is_self": true}
