{"id": "enzxte", "title": "Arbitrage opportunities with put credit spreads?", "selftext": " I have got a question on put credit spreads if anyone can help me out. Suppose stock ABC is trading at 50$ a share. Suppose we have two puts that expire on the same date, lets say the 60$ and 70$ strikes.\n\nThe 60$ put costs 10$ a share and the 70$ put costs 20.50$ a share, for the sake of argument. This is an arbitrage opportunity, isn't it? Sell the 70$ strike, and buy the 60$ strike. You will have to make at least .50$ a share (20.50-10). Do I have this right? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIF anyone is willing to correct me on any misunderstandings, I would greatly appreciate this. If I am correct, is there any reason not to buy a whole metric fuckton of put credit spreads if I am guaranteed to make money?", "created_utc": 1578894142, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/enzxte/arbitrage_opportunities_with_put_credit_spreads/", "is_self": true}
