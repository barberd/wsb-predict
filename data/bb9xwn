{"id": "bb9xwn", "title": "Reminder that you're retarded", "selftext": "You aren't aware agriculture is finally failing in the US, one of the last bastions of the planet where it seemed like it was going to be OK for a while, because your kind (average lemmings) don't think shit being important is enough reason to talk about it so information like that doesn't always spread to you individually. You will act surprised when there's a potato shortage in the US this year and you will act surprised again when there's mass starvation a few years later.\n\nYou aren't aware 2020 is scheduled to have a massive economic rejuvenation even though *everybody* in the know has been trying to tell you for at least the past 10-15 years that I've been a conscious mind.\n\nYou think it's surprising there is a slowdown after a growth boom as insane as 2016-2018. Did you *want* a bubble?\n\nYou think I'm shitposting when I share [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bb9i5s/the_future_of_transoceanic_freight_get_in_now/) with you because despite being \"finance\" people you don't have a wide information basis about all the industries in the world you live in, not even a good enough information basis for a normal person, let alone a speculative trader, so you aren't aware the economy currently relies on unprofitable and unsustainable methods of getting people and freight across the ocean, you just pretend there's enough fuel for all the airplanes and cargo ships and pretend our environment isn't approaching certain doom at a faster rate than we're approaching an ability to do any cleaning at scale, let alone actual terraforming. \n\nYou can't do basic evaluation of a share price and just make completely random guesses of where LYFT should be when it's a brand-new stock that couldn't be simpler to analyze. \n\nMost of you failed to get into AMD at under $2.00 when it was the most obvious buy in the past 10 years. That's not an isolated example, most of you miss or ignore everything. Most *millionaires and billionaires* who make *millions and billions of dollars* on their trading somehow missed this too, but they can afford to be retarded so maybe they're retarded by choice, you guys cannot afford it and so clearly aren't doing it by choice.\n\nThe average lemming has an insanely strong addiction to pretending nobody is better than them, and I hate the average lemming, so I just like giving a reminder whenever I can of the fact that I'm better than you.
