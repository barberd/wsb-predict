{"id": "dcri3x", "title": "Disney &amp; ATVI Calls", "selftext": "Hello, my fellow degenerates, \n\nI'm seeking advice on Disney and ATVI. I bought into Disney at the $133 dip with a strike price of $140 by 11/15 which I thought was a no brainer. Of course, it dipped to $127 now, fuck me right? Should I double down at a strike price of $133 by 11/15? In regards to ATVI, we had a nice boost this morning due to the hype of COD mobile. I bought in at the $52 drip with a strike price of $60 by 11/15. Thoughts?", "created_utc": 1570112192, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dcri3x/disney_atvi_calls/", "is_self": true}
