{"id": "fflua0", "title": "Question About TLT and Interest Rates", "selftext": "Hey Autists! I have a question about TLT. My understanding is that as rates go down TLT is supposed to go up. Last week was actually able to make about 5% on my dry powder because I had it sitting in TLT. I was planning to leave it in there in anticipation of more rate cuts but something has me worried. If you look at the option charts for TLT and IEF there is WAY more people interested in puts than calls and this has me spooked. I asked my wife's boyfriend but he just told me fuck off. Am I missing something here? How come so many ten of thousands of people think these treasury bond funds will go down if they're supposed to go up as bond yields and interest rates go down?", "created_utc": 1583712604.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fflua0/question_about_tlt_and_interest_rates/", "is_self": true}
