There is also the general idea that the Fed \"can't\" buy stocks, by law, but with no oversight and its ease of saying \"we're going to buy ETFs that hold corporate bonds\" its clear that they can do whatever they want with no functional limitation - as those ETFs are just corporate bonds in stock form. We dont know what's on their balance sheet and they self report limited information about the size and type of assets.\n\n**BUT, forget about this indirect and opaque stuff.**\n\n**Other Central Banks do what the Fed can't.**\n\nIn particular, the Swiss National Bank. The SNB which is publicly traded so $SNB, has been buying US stocks for years. If it wasn't Switzerland they would be called a \"currency manipulator\", but instead we just coordinate our monetary policy with them. They are pretty transparent about it. They also pay dividends.\n\nSwitzerland isn't a large currency union so they can't realistically backstop and pump the US stock market for hundreds of billions or trillions of dollars, but they can be a large contributor to adding confidence.\n\nOther peripheral EU countries have their own Central Banks too if they are not in the Eurozone.\n\nSo pay attention to their balance sheets and actions too, to wonder who you are fighting. The $SNB would typically have to create CHF, buy USD and then buy US equities, but the $SNB fixes the CHF to be at near parity with the US dollar for half a decade, making it easy to negotiate block trades if they wanted.", "created_utc": 1586884418.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g19kil/other_central_banks_do_what_the_fed_cant_do/", "is_self": true}
