But if I didn\u2019t sell when I did ($22), I would have lost it all. It\u2019s currently trading at $5. I ended up meeting one of their largest investors in person long after I sold and he said word for word \u201cthey have no idea what they are doing over there.\u201d\nI have since made that money back two fold from pure luck. Had good trades due to just random timing and lucky stock picks. I\u2019m not great at this but my portfolio just hit 30k. Started with $300 in 2016 with AMD. So it\u2019s been an interesting few years. I\u2019m 25 now. It would be cool to hit a million before I\u2019m 50 so that\u2019s what the goal is for the account. Sorry I\u2019m ranting.
