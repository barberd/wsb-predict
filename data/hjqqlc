{"id": "hjqqlc", "title": "BYND is Strapped on a rocket waiting to propel", "selftext": "TL:TR BYND is going to the moon in the near term\n\nBYND was already partnered with Yum Brands and Starbuck. Its newest partner, in the biggest market yet, is Alibaba. As part of the partnership, Beyond Meat product will be available in 200 Freshippo Supermarket in China. Freshippo is a high-end supermarket own and operated by Alibaba that also offers grocery delivery. \n\n1) Chinese people love foreign products. When Costco opened in China, the line to get inside the parking lot was 3 hours; when Popeye opened in China, the line was also 2-3 hours. So you can imagine the potential of explosive sales Beyond Meat might experience. \n\n2) It can get viral. Just imagine if any influencer marketer hyped up Beyond Meat in China, I am 100% sure the demand will outpace their production by a wide margin. Even if just a small portion of high income of Chinese middle class tries it once or twice, that's already a very explosive growth for BYND for at least 1-2 years. \n\n3) The Alibaba partnership definitely has not been priced-in, BYND opened +10% today morning but pulled back to end the day. I can see this partnership at least double or even triple Beyond Meat's expected sales for the next year, assuming their product can match demand. I have friends in China already thinking about buying and reselling the product because it is already sold out. That telling you the demand outweighs supply by a lot. \n\nExpect BYND to explode in the near term and it can sustain a much higher stock price if the Chinese market is just moderately successful. I expect BYND to retest its previous all-time high within the next 1-2 weeks.", "created_utc": 1593666089.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hjqqlc/bynd_is_strapped_on_a_rocket_waiting_to_propel/", "is_self": true}
