As well, at least Thailand and Malaysia have started to see the beginnings of outbreak worries &amp; sickness confirmations, which would absolutely wreck them considering their shitty healthcare infrastructure, and thus wreck the material supply for 70% of the world's rubber.\n\nGoodyear Tire hosted their earnings call a couple of days ago, and stated that,  \u201cis not clear what the full impact of the Coronavirus disruption will be,\" when it comes to guiding future quarters.  They have a plant in China, the Goodyear-Pulandia plant. It\u2019s located in the Liaoning province, which is a critical port/shipping spot for China. The plant has been closed for 9 days, soft opened on the 10th, and employees will be \u201cworking remote\u201d until the 17th. \n\nClearly their inventory will be fucked due to no hands being on deck for half a month (1/6 of a fucking quarter), but that may not be the only worry here...\n\nIf the port traffic is down &amp; they aren't receiving raw rubber from the local SE Asian sources due to ***their*** production issues, then things will get much worse from there. China is responsible for 14% of sales &amp; 21% of their operating income as of Jan 2019, &amp; that has only scaled since then. \n\nThe rubber sourcing issue is what I believe was referred to when stated that Coronavirus outlook was, \"not clear.\" \n\n***Nearer to the next quarter's earnings, I would consider shorting $GT, and flipping long whenever you feel that the impacts of all of the above have been measured.***\n\n***Alternatively, you can long rubber on the SICOM.***", "created_utc": 1581522892, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f2t8mg/goodyear_the_coronavirus_dd/", "is_self": true}
