{"id": "fajqc5", "title": "Did I play $PTON right?", "selftext": "Hey guys, my name is Victor and I study engineering. I know a lot about gambling because i've been playing poker as a side income for the past five year. After reading WSB for a year I essentially switched from hard liquor to krokodil and opened a brokerage account a month ago.\n\nI've come to realize that, just like poker, trading FDs is very hard to learn because you can get punished for your good decision and, worst of all, you can get rewarded for bad plays.\n\nI made some money playing $PTON and i'd like to get you guys opinion on my thought process. Thanks!\n\nMy goal was to swing trade using RSI. Since stock used to only go up, I wanted an oversold stock that had an history of hitting overbought RSI and sell once it went back to that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI settled on $PTON because it was a retard meme strenght that was heavily shilled by /u/MikeThePutz*.* It's 1h graph took about 10 day on average to swing so I took an ITM 2/28 27c at around 27.75$ on feb 7.\n\nI knew I needed an exit strategy, so I decided i'd give up if RSI dipped back into oversold. I didn't stick to that plan because it felt wrong to sell after it hit a bottom but I think this is a big problem in my strategy I need to fix.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3z1daq8xejj41.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4fb4da552d5d6777561eb3e6a25602d0e0cc3ecb\n\nIt's really a miracle that I was able to get away with it since the big rally it had in the last few day happened while the market suffered an huge correction. I think the reason is that the lockup ending on feb 24th was overanticipated and it was a real surprise when it didn't go to shit. [There is also another retarded reason given](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/peloton-could-see-bump-home-201420811.html)\n\nI really don't think it make sense but I read in a bunch of place PTON was a coronavirus play.\n\nSince it was now overbought, and because people dont buy bike during the apocalypse, I immediatly bought a 27put for 3/20 expecting a pullback from the \\~8% gain day. I didn't intend on holding this puts for long considering how great the last few days were and I'm really unsure about expiry date. Once again, no real exit plan :X. My plan was to sell when 5 minute RSI went to oversold but it didn't happen and I got stuck holding overnight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCorona finally caught up today and i'm pretty proud to say I sold pretty much at the bottom. I decide to sell when it crossed 27 (a price it spent a lot of time on the last few day) and started to finally face some resistance. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f24drw5dfjj41.png?width=1026&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c57316910880b52bf8c94dba10799fd6f372ba86\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI once again bought a call once again because I felt such an hard drill had to be followed by a rebound, and I sold a few moment later because it was going sideways and it crossed down the 25 MA. Really not sure about this I felt like my plan wasn't really solid and I sold because I didn't have an opinion on the future direction of the stock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, i'd like a number 9 with a large fry.", "created_utc": 1582840556, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fajqc5/did_i_play_pton_right/", "is_self": true}
