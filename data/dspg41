I have an incredibly addictive personality... first it was games, and now \"trading\" (gambling). Gaming nearly had such a hold on me that I almost dropped out of undergrad, and apparently I haven't learned any better now that I'm in grad school. A friend showed me Robinhood this summer, and of course I thought, \"I can beat the system! I can know what I'm doing better than these idiots and make enough money to get through grad school with ease!\". And, of course, the first one was free - I turned $2,000 into about $7,000 on CLR calls when that Saudi oil field went boom boom. Did I withdraw my gains? Or even my principle? Nah, why limit my gains? This shit is easy!\n\nWhat happened over the ensuing two months was an addiction taking hold. I wanted, needed, craved seeing green in my Robinhood... and, of course, I didn't actually know shit about stocks, so I lost that $7,000. But I kept depositing more, too - this was all just bad luck, so I could make it all back!\n\nI deposited every penny from my checking account into Robinhood. As of last week, I put in $6,300, and I have $230 left. I don't know how I'll pay for rent at the end of the month. I don't know how I'll pay for the part of grad school not covered by my scholarships. I don't have friends or family who can help... I just don't know what I can do.\n\nI love this subreddit, and I love the extremism here... it's hilariously entertaining. But please, please be careful, guys. A $6,000 loss is nothing compared to some of what I've seen, but it's... it was all I had.  Do your best to actually keep your \"Personal Risk Tolerance\" realistic to what your finances allow.", "created_utc": 1573086732, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dspg41/please_be_careful_fellow_autists_dont_gamble_your/", "is_self": true}
