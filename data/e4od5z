{"id": "e4od5z", "title": "The infinite money bug /u/Aidangamer28 discovered has been around since at least March", "selftext": "I wrote myself some scripts to interact with the Robinhood API back in March. While testing them out I found something weird. If you bought options with the bid/ask at 0.01/0.00 and then tried to sell them back with a multi-leg order, Robinhood would buy them back at 0.01 each.\n\nThe bid/ask was at 0.01/0.00. You would buy for 0.01. When you tried to sell back, the bid/ask would still be 0.01/0.00, yet the RH API would let you sell for 0.01. You could buy as many shit 0.01/0.00 options you wanted, your RH net worth graph would drop (reflecting your poor choice), and then you could get them all refunded and your RH net worth graph would go back up.\n\nThis never failed and I never had any money taken out of my account as a result.\n\nI always thought this was an API-specific bug, and I was too scared to investigate it and risk legal trouble.\n\nMy guess is that /u/Aidangamer28's iron condors are erroneously getting filled due to a similar Robinhood order-flow bug. He accidentally found a way to abuse the bug I was too scared to look into.", "created_utc": 1575236864, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e4od5z/the_infinite_money_bug_uaidangamer28_discovered/", "is_self": true}
