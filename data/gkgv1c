Not gonna lie I'm kinda disappointed in myself. Just based on the sheer number of positions odds state some of them should have worked out - but here we are - with nothing working. \n\nI could not get on the right side of a trade to save my life today! I either missed the big momentum plays - was too late for them - or didn't FOMO into things when I probably should have. Big one for the day that I almost jumped in but didnt is SRNE - almost jumped in at $5 but didn't - and there go 300% gains. There are more than a few cases in the below where my stops saved me from worse losses though - so I'll take that and be happy. \n\nI'm not going to dissect all of the positions I took - but if I was going to summarize what happened - it was four issues. \n\n1. Missed entries on opening - I was watching things at open and though there would be more of a shakeout before going up - so I missed good prices on TWLO and DDOG which I was tracking.\n2. Not leaving at peaks - for UBER and TWTR I was up $100 at one point, but counted on my trailing stops to catch me with profit - but since they both peaked and then dropped I missed out on the profit opportunity.\n3. Calling momentum wrong over and over - the rest of my bad plays were emblematic of me just hopping onboard a ride up at exactly the wrong times - I really really had terrible timing for pretty much everything today.\n4. Hoping to get even - there were definitely a few things where I was like oh if this goes well I'll get even for the day and call it quits - I should've just cut it in the morning when I was only $20 down. Sitting on cash is a position!\n\nGoing to relax over the weekend - do some work for my actual job - and be happy about being up 50% for a weeks work. And also all my money finally arrived! - so I can jump in more throughout the day next week. I actually ended today with around $200 in dry powder, so I'll give myself a pat on the back for restraining when there really weren't any plays. \n\nOn the bright side an SLV play I had on my RH account finally printed 100% today - so I pocketed those gains today - an extra $330! So tha'ts money that did print! But I won't be counting it against this total here. \n\n**The Plan:**\n\n1. Get a TDA cash account and fund with $2000\n2. Play intra-day swing and momentum trades\n3. Cut losses early and often - wins will accumulate over losses.\n4. Take profits Regularly\n   1. Account Balance $4000 - take $2000 to cover initial investment\n   2. Account Balance $14328 - take $12328 to cover cash losses\n   3. Account balance of $6057.37 - take $4057.37 to cover equity losses\n\n**Position History:**\n\nDay 5: 5/15 -6.57% ($2665.08 - $2489.82)\n\n|Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|BYND 5/22 120P|\\-$18|1|$186|$168|\n|JD 5/22 50C|\\-$14|1|$134|$120|\n|JD 5/22 51C|\\+$1|1|$120|$121|\n|NEM 5/22 68.5C|\\-$23|1|$179|$159|\n|TWLO 5/22 205C|\\-$49|1|$400|$351|\n|TWTR 5/22 30C|\\+$30|3|$73|$78|\n|UBER 5/22 33C|\\-$12|2|$109|$103|\n|VTIQ 6/19 30C|\\-$4|1|$285|$281|\n|WIX 6/19 240C|\\-$55|1|$419|$364|\n|WORK 5/22 32C|\\-$13|1|$129|$116|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDay 4: 5/14 +9.96% ($1968.86 - $2165.08)\n\n|Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|TWLO 5/22 200c|\\-$26|1|$425|$399|\n|BAC 5/15 21C|\\+$63|3|$41|$62|\n|GS 5/15 172.5C|\\+$46|2|$183|$206|\n|JPM 5/15 87C|\\+$135|5|$68|$95|\n|LCRX 5/15 270C|\\-$77|1|$342|$265|\n|MS 5/15 37.5C|\\+$10|5|$44|$46|\n|WFC 5/15 24C|\\+$67|3|$41|$63.5|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDay 3: 5/13 +8.35% - $1356.57 - $1469.84\n\n|Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|CODX 6/19 20C|\\-$22|1|$277|$255|\n|TWLO 5/22 200C|\\+$174|1|$469|$643|\n|DDOG 5/15 70C|\\+$45|1|$200|$245|\n|NVDA 5/15 335C|\\-$39|1|$213|$174|\n|ZM 5/15 180C|\\-$39|1|$180|$141|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDay 2: 5/12 +29.53% - $1046.34 - $1356.57\n\n|Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|CRM 6/19 200C|\\+2|1|$263|$265|\n|EGHT 6/19 20C|\\+59|1|$191|$250|\n|TWLO 5/29 205C|\\+30|1|$370|$400|\n|VTIQ 5/15 30C|\\+224|2|$103|$215|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDay 1: 5/11 +5% - $1000.89 - $1046.34\n\n|Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|DDOG 5/15 55c|\\+54|1|$380|$434|\n|CSCO 5/15 44.5c|\\-16|2|$214|$198|\n|CHWY 5/15 39.5c|\\+12|1|$134|$146|\n\nFAQ:\n\n* Why do I have so many day trades with such a small account?\n   * Cash accounts aren't subject to PDT restrictions - instead what happens is that you can only spend up to the amount of cash you have in a day.For Example - at open today I have $1050 in cash - meaning I could buy up to $1050 in option positions for the day. As long as I sell whatever positions I have by market close - that $1050 plus whatever gains I made during the day are available as cash in my account by market open tomorrow. It does end up limiting the number of positions I can take in a day because I only have so much cash - but it allows me to easily prevent losses by having a tight stop loss - and it allows me to take gains when my positions do well.\n   * Technical Side:It does take time for the cash to \"settle\", ie. have the transaction be processed. For stocks that is T+2 - meaning your cash is available two days after you close the position. However for options that is only T+1 - meaning the cash is available back in your account the day after you sell the position.\n* What Broker am I using?\n   * TD Ameritrade and their ThinkOrSwim platform. You pay $1.10 for every round-trip contract, but it is definitely worth it - if only to be able to set a proper trailing stop.\n   * TD Ameritrade cash accounts also let you purchase options - which is not something thats possible with RH.\n* Please take my advice with a grain of salt - this is all coming from a guy who lost over $15,000 in the past two months - so pleaseee treat my advice with the skepticism it deserves.", "created_utc": 1589574537.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gkgv1c/day_5_515_from_down_to_up_the_road_to_1838537_657/", "is_self": true}
