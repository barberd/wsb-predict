They are based in Oregon USA.  They manufacture infrared thermal sensors.\n\nTSA data confirms that airport traffic is picking up, still relatively tiny however they have also put out a press release release outlining protocol to check all traveler's temperatures (referenced here  [https://www.wsj.com/articles/tsa-preparing-to-check-passenger-temperatures-11589579570](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tsa-preparing-to-check-passenger-temperatures-11589579570) )\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy question is, why hasn't this stonk mooned? It has done not much of anything but as states open up and we prepare for a protracted \"new normal\" even theme parks in asia are using this technology to screen incoming patrons, shouldn't this sell like hotcakes. My question to you esteemed gentleYOLO's is why it has not yet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: When I say it has done nothing I mean it's down like 19% YTD. Yes it is up 90% from March but this shit should be WAY up YTD, no? I don't get how fucking Sam Adams is up YTD and a company that makes infrared thermometers in the middle of the biggest pandemic is down YTD lol", "created_utc": 1589682607.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gl7k43/flir_why_hasnt_it_exploded/", "is_self": true}
