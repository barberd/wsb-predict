{"id": "f2l2fi", "title": "How to buy Harry Potter shares?", "selftext": "Sorry, I'm new here and cousin told me this is the sub to ask people about more speculative trades.\n\nMy broker (TD America Trade) misunderstood me and gave me Hewllet Packard shares back in 2015 when I told them to buy shares of HP. I found out today (after 4 years) that it was a mistake and it's up about 100% but I'm angry at the same time because I know I would have made a lot more money if it was Harry Potter.\n\nI've been a Harry Potter fan since childhood and I continue to believe the series will sell a lot of books and movies for many years to come. Perhaps even remakes. Also I saw the HP books have sold more than the Holy Bible itself (wow).\n\nAnyway as the title says how do I buy stocks in Harry Potter, and maybe I need to find a different broker if TD America Trade doesn't sell it?", "created_utc": 1581479706, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f2l2fi/how_to_buy_harry_potter_shares/", "is_self": true}
