Now we are seeing the biggest injection of human civilization https://twitter.com/realwillmeade/status/1226645959255433217?s=21\n\nIt is very hard to get against the market but bears finally found their best friend bats \ud83e\udd87.\n\nFirst of all there\u2019s no doubt that the data released by Winnie The Poo Poo is real. \n\nWe see possible leak of the real data here. https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=228004\n\nAlso on Weibo there\u2019s mountains of anecdotes and posts of people telling death stories and how big of a shit show it is. \n\nNow there\u2019s this 4chan genius hypothesizing Wuhan has burnt 20k bodies as a result of astronomically high density of SO2 being observed. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/inteldotwav/status/1226267582740811777?s=21\n\nNow we are seeing massive speculations on systematic shutdown of factories.

Sometimes you just need to back off from the market cause none of us retail autists are really that smart. If anything I\u2019d trust market liquidity and bet smaller positions buying dips. \n\nLastly red trades to all.", "created_utc": 1581294977, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f1i3zj/bears_best_friends_are_bats/", "is_self": true}
