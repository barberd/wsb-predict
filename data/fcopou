The general public does not understand the spread yet.  That sub posts up to the minute news.  Right now it\u2019s not big numbers but it is very widespread and the numbers will extrapolate quickly.  \n\n2.  The CDC is not testing enough people and they are not reporting accurate numbers.  Maybe pressured by Trump?  But shortly the true numbers will come out when they can\u2019t hide it anymore.  When they do the clowns at the fed wont be able to curtail the market impact.  \n\nI wouldn\u2019t love a 3/6 date, but I\u2019m feeling good about 3/20 and great about 4/17.  Short spy, tqqq, eww.  Determine your own strike based on your risk tolerance.  Things are expensive now.  Looking for 20 baggers was a thing of 2 weeks ago.  I\u2019m happy to try to aim for 100-200% return.", "created_utc": 1583207316, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fcopou/hold_your_puts/", "is_self": true}
