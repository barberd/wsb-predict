Unemployment insurance claims are putting out on average $340-350 per week, and on top of this, a majority will quality for an additional $600 per week for just being unemployed. \n\nIt seems that a majority if not all of these transactions are released in the form on a VISA Debit card. If I just roughly do some retard math, the minimum monthly amount in those VISA cards would be in the $35 Billion per month into these accounts. And no I didn\u2019t account for the $600 addendum, which even if 50% of the unemployed qualified, it would be close to an additional $31B per month. That\u2019s a grand total of $66B per month loaded into VISA debit accounts, which on a span on say 5-6 months of unemployment, would be worth $330B-360B for the next two quarters. Now granted, not all of the money will be used as I assume people will hoard some of it, but even 30% consumption would equate to close to 100B in added transactions for the next two quarters.
