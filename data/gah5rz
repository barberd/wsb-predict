If there is a bubble to pop it won't be happening until it hits around or near $1000 per share.\n\n***SPY was already up pre-market and continued climbing throughout the day today despite higher unemployment numbers, more business closures, and GDP contraction.***\n\nAll 5 will receive an ***additional benefit*** due to Dr.Jerome's **FED Promise Gurantee**, which will involve the fed continuing to pump money into the economy, help banks and larger corporations, and will be purchasing more junk bonds, along with other manipulation tactics.\n\nThis means that if you go in on all 5 of these with calls there is a 89% chance you will be ranking in massive dow either by the end of tomorrow trading day or until the end of Fridays trading day.\n\n**Never before has such a tsunami of money been (Potentially) on the table for free.** The only wild card is how much TSLA will climb, but you could remove that risk and still have a safe money making bet regardless.\n\n*Who is in?*", "created_utc": 1588192613.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gah5rz/fb_msft_qcom_tsla_earnings_after_hours_and_fed/", "is_self": true}
