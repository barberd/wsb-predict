There are about 2100 teams and I am 69th in Canada for the competition. The team that is number one also goes to my school and is in the other class. Their miles ahead in profit compared to # 2. The winner takes $2000 and a golden certificate that is perfect for university applications. If I win, I\u2019ll be set to start my life (fr) I am new to this and really want to win. I know everyone says not to put all your eggs in one basket but I really need to win and I\u2019m behind. The competition is ending in 1 month and I have 100,000 to spend (virtually). (Number 1 team already made 50k profit). What are some stocks that I can invest in that are about to explode this month. I\u2019m new to this and really want to win, Im a senior and have started researching the market, but no one seems to know anything about stocks around me. We\u2019re obviously not using real money but it is real stocks. We can only use stocks that are traded on NASDAQ, NYSE, and TSX.
