I'm reading a Benzinga report about an influx of May 15 $30 calls. \n\nPinterest isn't just mood inspiration - it's a conversion channel where people click before they make their purchase on CPG goods and whatever fucking bullshit people need for their children at Target. It's less a social channel and more of a search engine with a creative component. \n\nIt's also worth noting that the C-Suite isn't seeing enormous salaries - the CEO makes a hair less than $200K according go the S1 filing. \n\nI think it's a buy and the calls are a bit on the high side relative to the plummet. I'd eyeball a 26/$27 strike but that's just me.", "created_utc": 1573075022, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dsmq7g/pinterest_is_a_cornerstone_of_becky_it_took_a_big/", "is_self": true}
