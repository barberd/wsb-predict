Another is that it\u2019s EOM rebalancing.  A third interpretation is that the market sees the end of this epidemic soon, and has priced it in like the yearly flu epidemic. (Obviously, none of these are mutually exclusive).  As far as I\u2019m aware, the leading model ostensibly [confirms this outlook](https://i.imgur.com/DmHQm4h.png)- an April peak and then decline thereafter- but some important caveats: it doesn\u2019t look beyond August, and it also seems to trust China\u2019s apparently successful suppression of new cases, although SK and Germany represent other apparent models to emulate.  Is it realistic to expect the problem to go away after the first wave?\n\nAn [influential UK-focused modeling paper from March 16](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf) modeled that current lockdowns/social distancing indeed will allow UK cases to crest around late April, below hospital surge capacity.  \n\nBut it also found that relaxation of current suppression measures will allow a resurgence: [Figure 3 from Ferguson et al. 2020](https://i.imgur.com/xsKHvKo.png).  \n\nWith adequate surveillance, and continued measures protecting the elderly and immunocompromised, you can open the economy after the disease subsides, and reimpose lockdown suppression once cases rise above a trigger level:\n\n[Figure 4 from Ferguson et al. 2020](https://i.imgur.com/1O7f2On.png)\n\nHowever, note that this does not model proactive test, trace and isolate like in SK, just on-off of suppression measures.  We may get better at it over time, [Ferguson says]( https://i.imgur.com/B98tBOj.png), with SK as a model.\n\n\nWhat about SK? [This is what SK\u2019s new case history has looked like](https://i.imgur.com/YYN8cb9.png).  They did this *without* widespread lockdowns or social distancing, just with very intensive test, trace, and isolate.  However, do you think the US will be able to impose a \u201claw that grants the government wide authority to access data: CCTV footage, GPS tracking data from phones and cars, credit card transactions, immigration entry information, and other personal details of people confirmed to have an infectious disease\u201d?\n\nHow about Germany?  Germany instituted widespread test-and-trace fairly early on, with some success (notably on its CFR, although that\u2019s possibly due to its more China-like method of naming cause of death).  Its new case trajectory looks like [this](https://i.imgur.com/5wr8B4Z.png).  However, Germany [still had to institute lockdowns](http://archive.is/lp5mS), with significant community spread, unlike SK.  Germany, notably, doesn\u2019t have access to the data SK does, although things like a [mobile app](https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/03/27/world/europe/27reuters-health-coronavirus-germany.html) have been bandied about.  \n\n**Germany example tl;dr**: Germany is probably a best-case scenario for the US once we get this under control, because of Western civil liberties.  **But it still took a shutdown to accomplish it.**  This, one could imagine, militates in favor of a dynamic like in Ferguson et al. Fig 4.\n\nSome questions:\n\n**Can Germany or the US adopt a cluster-suppression SK approach once the current epidemic has died down?**\n\n**Does emulating Korea require invasive measures that won\u2019t fly in the West, or can workarounds be found?**\n\nPositions for everyone to inverse:\n\nDIS 96p Apr 03\n\nDIS 75p Apr 17\n\nBoring details below:\n\n----\n\n\nThe model relevant for the US, [medrxiv paper here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.27.20043752v1), updated projections [here](https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections), also confirms [the peak coming in mid-April and declining thereafter](https://i.imgur.com/DmHQm4h.png) (current as of Mar 31).  They assume current social distancing and nonessential business closure will be in place for the duration.  They also essentially assume that the epidemic *can* be brought to heel, and that new epidemics can be suppressed, [based mostly on China\u2019s example](https://i.imgur.com/vfn379y.png):\n\n>**\u201cMany other locations, including all other provinces in China, have so far successfully contained transmission, preventing a general outbreak\u201d**\n\n They also don\u2019t really model post-first-wave epidemics, only to the completion of the current, but say: \n\n>\u201dModeling for US states based on one completed epidemic, at least for the first wave, and many incomplete epidemics is intrinsically challenging.\u201d\n\nOn that front, the best-case examples would be Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea, and Germany.  \n\nIn South Korea, the intensive test, trace, and enforced isolation of suspected cases has so far been able to mostly squelch the disease at the cluster level (of course, without serological surveys, it\u2019s hard to know this for sure).\n\nCheck this out:\n\n>*South Korea is also enforcing a law that grants the government wide authority to access data: CCTV footage, GPS tracking data from phones and cars, credit card transactions, immigration entry information, and other personal details of people confirmed to have an infectious disease.*\n\n>*The authorities can then make some of this public, so anyone who may have been exposed can get themselves - or their friends and family members - tested.*\n\n>*People found positive are placed in self-quarantine and monitored remotely through an app or checked regularly in telephone calls until a hospital bed becomes available. When this occurs, an ambulance picks the person up and takes them to a hospital with air-sealed isolation rooms.*\n\n[13 Mar source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/italy-south-korea-differ-tackling-coronavirus-outbreak-200313062505781.html)\n\nNew clusters have been identified and pursued, and it remains to be seen whether SK\u2019s success will hold ([Mar 17 source](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/coronavirus-cases-have-dropped-sharply-south-korea-whats-secret-its-success#)), but [this is what SK\u2019s new case history has looked like](https://i.imgur.com/YYN8cb9.png).  They did this without widespread closures of nonessential businesses; things like museums have reopened since mid-March.\n\n----", "created_utc": 1585680891.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fsit3k/is_the_market_really_not_pricing_in_the/", "is_self": true}
