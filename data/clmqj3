I\u2019ll also only be watching for about an hour at a time.  With recent Volatility not sure if it\u2019s too wise to leave options unchecked.\n\nAre you buying 50 delta riding your direction and making a spread to lock in profit?\n\nDo you tend to prefer making it a debit spread or a credit?\n\nOr do you just open a debit spread and wait until 50% profit?\n\nPs how to turn $6k into $12k?", "created_utc": 1564860485, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/clmqj3/playing_with_90_delta_options/", "is_self": true}
