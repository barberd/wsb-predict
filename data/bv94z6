{"id": "bv94z6", "title": "Congressional activity: week of 6/3 to 6/7", "selftext": "Good Friday, and welcome to this installment of Congressional activity and financial markets. The general idea is that the statements and actions of federal legislators can have an effect on broader markets. I try to provide interesting happenings as well as participants. I don't suggest any specific positions: I'd like those to come from consensus in the discussion.\n\nA few things to keep in mind:\n\n- All of this is subject to change at any time (i.e. votes can be delayed, hearings can be canceled, witnesses can be struck). The House and Senate operate under their own rules, and those rules are entirely enforced by the chambers themselves.\n- The House is controlled by Democrats, and the Senate is controlled by Republicans. So if a hearing is happening in the House, it is somewhat safe to assume that it reflect a relatively liberal position. However, the committees have representation by both parties, so the discussion won't be entirely one-sided.\n- In general, recorded votes on the ``floor'' of either chamber are taken the most seriously, followed by votes (or hearings) taken by the full committee, followed by votes (or hearings) by a subcommittee.\n- The Senate is generally taken more seriously than the House, since it moves slower and is less likely to produce legislation. Thus, the legislation it does produce is exceptionally important. A corollary, though, is that the Senate has much less activity in any given week (only 100 members, but the same workload [plus appointments] as the 435-member House).\n- The floor schedule of either chamber is notoriously hard to predict more than a day or two in advance, as it is structured almost entirely by party leadership and can change on the whims of that leadership. Hearings, however, are relatively more stable and scheduled. (In other words, the hearings are much more certain to happen, while the votes can be added or subtracted with much less certainty.)\n- This is not all activity, just activity most likely to be relevant to financial markets. There is also no guarantee this activity has an effect on any individual stock or market. I'm not an expert, and this is not advice. It is the beginning of a discussion.\n\n***\n\nResults from last week:\n\n- The House and Senate were out of session for a district work week due to Memorial Day\n\n***\n\nShared activity (across both chambers):\n\nThe House will hold subcommittee hearings on 6/4 to review STELAR, the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act. STELAR is set to expire at the end of 2019. It's the centerpiece of a protracted battle between local broadcasters (https://www.multichannel.com/news/nab-launches-fight-against-stelar-renewal) and cable and satellite companies (https://www.rbr.com/atva-seeks-to-secure-stelar-for-consumers/). Originally, STELAR was meant to help remote areas (with satellite) receive local channels (with no nearby affiliate) by providing a means to negotiate rates of retransmission. Technology has evolved, though, and STELAR is no longer technologically necessary, but cable and satellite companies still want the rates and concessions. The ATVA from above is an industry-backed force. The House is run by Democrats, so the language in the hearing is likely to be consumer-friendly. There's no witness list yet, but satellite companies (DISH and T, owner of DirectTV) get mentioned the most in the coverage.\n\nThis is paired with Senate full committee hearings on 6/5 on the changing media marketplace (https://www.commerce.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/hearings?ID=AE6E9B57-F306-46CF-8D9C-245A9AE16E60). The intent is ``to discuss how new entrants in the video marketplace and the development of digital programming and streaming services have impacted consumer viewing habits and preferences. The hearing will also examine existing laws governing the video marketplace and their role in fostering access to content and promoting competition, localism, and diversity of viewpoints.'' Witnesses include the president of the NCTA, an interest group that promotes an open internet, and the president of the NAB, the interest group that defends local broadcasters in the STELAR discussion mentioned above.\n\n***\n\nHouse activity:\n\nThe House is likely to take a vote on HR 6, a bill to extend Obama-era immigration protections for so-called Dreamers, or immigrants who came to the US at a young age. It also outlines some other specifications on criminal behavior (https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/BILLS-116hr6ih/pdf/BILLS-116hr6ih.pdf). The intent of the legislation is that Congress can override Executive Orders through legislation, and this is the House's attempt to do just that. To be clear: this has zero percent chance of becoming law. The Senate probably won't even pick it up, and the president would never sign it. But it is directly targeted at Trump's attempt to end DACA in 2017 (https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/trump-dreamers-daca-immigration-announcement-n798686). This is going to send off a Twitterstorm like no other. Given the recent tariff rhetoric with Mexican imports, this might inflame those tensions even more.\n\nThe House will hold multiple subcommittee markup sessions on 6/4 (https://docs.house.gov/Committee/Calendar/ByEvent.aspx?EventID=109543) to markup HR 2500, defense appropriations (https://docs.house.gov/Committee/Calendar/ByEvent.aspx?EventID=109543). Markup is just committee work on a bill, but it might be salient and bring contract amounts for defense companies into the news cycle.\n\nThe House will hold subcommittee hearings on 6/4 on the risk of leveraged lending. They will feature finance professors as witnesses, so I'm imagining a lot of testimony on the effects of instruments featuring derivatives and how they are catastrophic for the financial system. The hearing features as-yet-unnamed legislation. One piece (https://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/bills-116pih-lleea.pdf) wants more risk management compliance; another (https://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/bills-116pih-lldaa.pdf) is designed ``to  require the Director of the Office of Financial Research to carry out an assessment of risks posed by the leveraged lending and collateralized loan obligation markets to the economy or financial stability of the United States, and for other purposes.''\n\nThe House will hold subcommittee hearings on 6/4 on modernizing VA medical records (https://veterans.house.gov/legislation/hearings/subcommittee-technology-modernization-hearing-modernizing-health-records). This could be interesting, as most of that work is currently contracted out to the private sector (https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2018/10/24-companies-join-vas-health-record-modernization-team/151815/). The second link contains names of companies popularly associated with the contracting work. If the House discusses more contracting, or better subsidies, or better contracts, or any combination, they might get a boost.\n\n***\n\nSenate activity:\n\nThe Senate is likely to take a vote sometime this week on their version of the Congressional budget (https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/1332/text). Budgets are not appropriations, they do not have force of law, and they only set broad spending targets and authority. In other words, they do not actually spend any money. But it might be worth it to comb through the budget (it's long) at your leisure and imagine the headlines that might emerge, specifically as they relate to private players. \n\nThe Senate will hold full committee hearings on 6/4 exploring expanded grid-scale energy storage (https://www.energy.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/hearings-and-business-meetings?ID=83B728AC-6708-40D6-9B96-CC007F5B5906). Grid-scale energy storage looks to help make power grids more flexible by storing excess power and deploying it during periods of high demand. There are a ton of energy storage companies (see https://www.prescouter.com/2018/08/six-energy-storage-companies-2018/), and two of them, Xcel (the CEO) and Fluence (a VP) are on the witness list. The bill (unnumbered at this time) authorizes subsidies of $60,000,000 annually for five years for the research and development of such systems (https://foster.house.gov/sites/foster.house.gov/files/FOSTER_029_xml.pdf, pg. 11). So these companies will likely look good in competition for those subsidies.\n\nThe Senate will hold subcommittee hearings on 6/5 on patent eligibility (https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/the-state-of-patent-eligibility-in-america-part-ii). Normally this would look like a nothingburger, but the third panel of witnesses is exclusively about biotech (General Counsel, Association for Accessible Medicines; Deputy General Counsel for Intellectual Property, Biotechnology Innovation Organization; Counsel, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America). This might be especially salient, given the recent protests against the costs of HIV drugs (https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/05/30/727731380/old-fight-new-front-aids-activists-want-lower-drug-prices-now) and the fight Gilead has had with the government over its patents, given federal money for drug research (https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/gilead-ceo-insists-federal-government-patent-for-hiv-prevention-pill-truvada-is-invalid/2019/05/16/7c0a79b6-77e1-11e9-b3f5-5673edf2d127_story.html?noredirect=on). \n\nThe Senate will hold hearings on nominations to a ton of financial positions on 6/5 (https://www.banking.senate.gov/hearings/05/28/2019/nomination-hearing). Nominees include Thomas Peter Feddo, for the Treasury for Investment Security; Nazak Nikakhtar, for Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security; Ian Paul Steff, for Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Director General of the United States and Foreign Commercial Service; Michelle Bowman, for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; Paul Shmotolokha, for First Vice President, the Export-Import Bank of the United States; and Allison Herren Lee, for the Securities and Exchange Commission. Bowman is a reappointment, so not too much new news there. But she might get questions on the health of the economy during her hearing (for the record, she's claimed that it is ``supporting most American families'' earlier this month [https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-federal-reserve-household-survey-20190523-story.html]). Any one of them could cause a bit of stir, but it's not in the full Senate yet.", "created_utc": 1559317538, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bv94z6/congressional_activity_week_of_63_to_67/", "is_self": true}
