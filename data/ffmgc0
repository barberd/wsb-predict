When you buy a put, you want the stonk to go down. If the price goes below your strike price, you make money correct?\n\n2. When you exercise a put option and buy 100 shares of equity of a certain stock, what happens if you don\u2019t have enough capital to do so? Ex. I bet $SPY goes down to $290 and I decide to exercise my option but I can\u2019t afford to buy 100 shares of $SPY because it is too expensive.\n\n3. Vice versa. What happens if you lose way more money than you currently have? Ex. I bet $SPY and suffer -$3,000 but I only have $700 in my TDA acc.\n\nThanks guys. I know I will be fucked so please fuck me harder than your wife fucks her boyfriend AFTER you answer a question of mine.
