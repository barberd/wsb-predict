{"id": "hiodd7", "title": "TSLA valuation", "selftext": "This is a topic that has already been milked alot but I want to talk about it.\n\nTSLA's book value is 6B, revenue is currently negative but it's not important bc it's a very small number compared to their cash.\n\nThe fact is that it currently has a market cap of 197B, so if hypothetically their debts disappear they got a book value of 32B, let's add another 20B for their brand so 52B, let's also say that their profit quadruples to 16B instantly, now it's fairly priced or even a bit undervalued if you use discounted cash flow as a method of evaluation.\n\nBut I dont think this is such a realistic view, I think Teslas will be widely used in the future and in years it will become a commonly used car not a rare/luxury one, but it's not an instant thing like in my example.\n\nBut it's possible that in years they quadruple their sales and so their profit, but that kind of advance is more or less already priced in the current price.\n\nI think if you buy now and hold it for decades (as you should do when you are investing) you will see a profit, but there's not a margin of safety and that cash would be better spent elsewhere where it would have better returns.", "created_utc": 1593527273.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hiodd7/tsla_valuation/", "is_self": true}
