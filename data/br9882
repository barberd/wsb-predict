Musk owns **33.9M** shares out of **178M** shares outstanding\n3. TSLA's share price of **$211.03** means Musk's holdings are worth **$7.1B**\n4. Assume a worst case margin requirement of **100%**\n5. Musk would need to secure **$507M** with **~$1B** in stock\n6. Musk has pledged **13.3M** shares or **$2.8B** at the current stock price\n6. That means Musk loans are secured by roughly **18%** of his shares pledged\n7. **18%** is well below the **25%** loan-to-pledge requirement set by the TSLA board\n8. TSLA would would have to be around **$151.53** for Musk to be in violation of the board's rule \n9. If #8 became a danger, Musk could simply pledge more shares, as only **39%** of Musk's shares are pledged right now, and the stock price would have to drop to **$151.53** before he'd have to pledge more.\n\nSources:\n\n1. https://ir.tesla.com/node/19821/html (507M in personal loans)\n2. https://ir.tesla.com/node/19856/html (Musk stock holdings)\n3. https://ir.tesla.com/node/19771/html (Shares outstanding pre-dilution)\n4. https://ir.tesla.com/node/19906/html (Dilution from Maxwell acquisition)\n5. https://ir.tesla.com/node/19861/html (Dilution from capital raise)\n6. https://ir.tesla.com/node/19726/html (Musk shares pledged)\n\nE: Added more data", "created_utc": 1558438076, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/br9882/elons_margin_call/", "is_self": true}
