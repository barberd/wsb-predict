{"id": "guo71a", "title": "Started 3 months ago, 5k to 24k to 500 to turning my stimulus check into 7.4k ( current )", "selftext": "So I was always interested in finance and I came across this sub and wanted to learn more about options. It all started with a hunch on Tesla, got around 12 shares with 5.5k I had in my savings. Then I started browsing the sub and didn\u2019t want to say anything especially since I had shares. Those share skyrocketed and I was able to start doing options just a few no more than $100. My whole family saw my returns and wanted to get in. I felt like Jordan Belfort. As my total got over the 15k mark my cocky ness got worse a lot. I said fuck it and started spending 1-5k on SPY options. I bought SPY puts mid week beginning of March and thurs and Friday following really fucked me in the ass big green dildo. I said fuck this let me \u201cinverse myself\u201d so I sold the SPY puts at a loss and bought SPY calls. I was full blown gambling big shot at this moment, all emotion no strategy. The next day, the big drop occurred and my account eventually deteriorated back down to 10k, started selling my Tesla shares to get money to double down on my SPY calls. Eventually it got down to $500 in a matter of 2-3 weeks. My parents could tell something was up, I was shook and it felt really bad but I kept coming here and reading about stories of people losing big and learning a lot and turning it around. I know 24k may not seem like a lot, but to me a 25 year old that grew up with nothing it\u2019s a lot. I didn\u2019t give up, and once my stimulus check came in I deposited that 1200 faster than I cum in you girlfriends mouths. My whole approach changed and I had nothing to lose but I really learned a lot from losing a lot. Slowly got myself up to around 7.4k and am taking it slow and using a notebook for strategy and moves daily. My portfolio consists of some safe plays right now but I have never been more confident in the positions or myself. DKNG 35c 1/15/21s, GOLD 26c 9/18/20, BA 160c 2022s, HIG 45c 2022s. There have been ups and downs but my point is that I wouldn\u2019t have wanted it any other way. You have to lose in order to succeed. It may feel bad at first but it teaches you how to react when it happens again ( and it will ). Do your own homework and take it slow, make a plan ahead of time and stick to it, no emotions, and always take profits. I really appreciate all the autists in here for all the insane shit that showed me the way. Hopefully I will keep winning but I am no longer afraid to lose. I look forward to losing as it is a nice reminder of where my autism started.", "created_utc": 1591030547.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/guo71a/started_3_months_ago_5k_to_24k_to_500_to_turning/", "is_self": true}
