{"id": "fyt01f", "title": "Current and Future Economy a Workers Perspective", "selftext": "I work at a manufacturing plant that was labeled an essential workforce.. the company offered employees the option to take a furlough I have not yet.. I will if I feel it necessary for health reasons. This company employs around 300 to 400 people and 32% of them took the furlough mostly due to said employees having family related health matters and or preexisting conditions. I'm just writing this as an example of the economic damage going on even at essential work places.\n\nHere is the part that scares me we make things for others that then resell these items. On the day to day under normal operations customers will call with new product orders that need to be designed made priced etc... \n\nNormally we would get 20 to 30 a week now we are lucky to get 1 or 2 a week. My point here is (and maybe its already obvious and writing this was a complete waist of my time) .. even essential workforce's are going to be dramatically effected as given in example above. \n\nNow imagine this across the whole nation, with company's big and small. Even if some of these company's manage to stay afloat and operational during these lock downs, I believe that a very large percentage of said company's will not return to there previous employment levels. Sure unemployment levels may come down some but I think they hover at record levels for the foreseeable future. \n\nNow with this in mind the average American carries about $130,000 dollars of debt, the majority from mortgages. Even with all that's been shitting the bed most people will still have an obligation to pay their bills.. ya sure maybe they'll be able to skip a payment or 2 .. but they fact remains that all debts must be paid. (Insert any politicians name here) \"we are going to let you skip your student loan payments for 6 months, we are going to let you skip your mortgage payments for 2 months, and you cant be evicted so don't worry , its just a flu\"\n\nThe problem here is ya you can skip payments and forgive interest here and there until the printers run out of ink, but at some point we are all going to have to pay the fuck up or get a PP in our butts. But fun fact the majority of us wont be able to do so with out taking on more debt from the same banks that are putting their PP's in our already stretched bung holes.\n\nWhen this happens its just going to create another fast growing housing and debt crisis the likes of which has never been seen before... again like the one that just happened ..but again another time at a different time but like last time but worse.\n\nThen the banks will own a bunch of shit, we will own a bunch of shit, and Mr. FuckinBRRRRRRRRRR will buy all of that shit again like last time but again in the future.\n\nIf your asking yourself holy shit the guy writing this is retarded yup I am, I once held my breath for to long for fun and part of my brain suffocated.\n\nHere is the take away the market is going to come back down again in my opinion in the next few weeks SPY will test 250 then this fake bitch will test 290 and be flat for maybe a few months, and if were lucky <--- sarcasm ... within the next year we are going to find out how all the big banks, hedge funds, and large corporations squandered our tax dollars away on some scam or shitty derivative to increase there profits while putting there big PP's in our butts. This Beer Virus is great depression phase 1, the BRRRR virus is great depression phase 2.\n\nBOOM THE NEXT GREAT DEPRESSION\n\nBuy puts \n\nI have no current position as of now but might try a little SPY on Monday\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2020/03/23/the-federal-reserve-moves-to-buy-corporate-debt/#6262129b4c47](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2020/03/23/the-federal-reserve-moves-to-buy-corporate-debt/#6262129b4c47)\n\n[https://www.debt.org/faqs/americans-in-debt/demographics/](https://www.debt.org/faqs/americans-in-debt/demographics/)\n\n[https://www.fool.com/millionacres/real-estate-financing/mortgages/heres-size-average-americans-mortgage/](https://www.fool.com/millionacres/real-estate-financing/mortgages/heres-size-average-americans-mortgage/)\n\n[https://www.thestreet.com/personal-finance/average-income-in-us-14852178](https://www.thestreet.com/personal-finance/average-income-in-us-14852178)\n\n[https://www.valuepenguin.com/average-household-budget](https://www.valuepenguin.com/average-household-budget)\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp)", "created_utc": 1586565977.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fyt01f/current_and_future_economy_a_workers_perspective/", "is_self": true}
