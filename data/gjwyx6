{"id": "gjwyx6", "title": "The SLV Standard", "selftext": "Are you tired of inversing yourself only to inverse your inverse 3 more times and still losing a shitload of cash???\n\nBulls and bears- we've been fighting this whole time that both sides have not kept their eyes on the true prize here- commodities. \n\nIn times of recession and uncertainty, one thing has always remained a safe haven for investors- commodities. Combine that with the fact that the governments of the world are printing fucktons of money devaluing the currencies of the world? Guess what can't be printed?? **SILVER AND GOLD BABY**\n\nAlright here are the fast facts:\n\n1. SLV jumped from around $9 to $45 during the great recession. This time around, the fed is printing **much** more aggressively than the last time and in a shorter time span as well.\n\n2. The DOW to Silver ratio is at its 2nd highest peak in the last 100 years, with the highest peak coming before the dotcom bubble crash, when it immediately started a reversal to generational lows.\nhttps://www.macrotrends.net/2610/dow-to-silver-ratio-100-year-historical-chart\n\n But hey, thats cool and all, how is silver doing compared to gold?  \n\n3. Gold to Silver ratio is at its all time high for the LAST 100 YEARS. Yes, in THE LAST 100 YEARS, gold has never been as valuable compared to silver as it is now. In Nov 2008, the ratio was at 80 and eventually fell to 38. GLD is up 3.8% since the crash and SLV is down 14.3% and poised to regain those losses.\nhttps://www.macrotrends.net/1441/gold-to-silver-ratio\n\n4. SLV also appears to have broken out of its trading range for the past month and a half and is ready to rebound to pre corona levels and beyond.\n\nPremiums on SLV calls are still cheap, around 40% IV with potential to be a 10 bagger.\n\nPositions: SLV $15C 12/31/2020", "created_utc": 1589496440.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gjwyx6/the_slv_standard/", "is_self": true}
