While my wife is out having sex with straight men,  Im stuck at home with my pecker in my hand, thinking \u201cno way Japan doesn\u2019t postpone or cancel the olympics.\u201d \n\n33% of Japans population is over the age of 60. You think they\u2019re just gonna risk yeeting away a whole generation? \n\nThey expect 600,000 tourists and 11,000 athletes to come into Tokyo. Japan still hasn\u2019t been able to demonstrate control of the situation, and were already seeing professional sports get pushed back. NBA? Fucked. MLB? Fucked. NHL? Fucked.  Not to mention that Donny suggested them to postpone it as well. \n\nOfficials from the Olympic committee stated that they\u2019re not even considering postponing/cancelling them. My bet is they\u2019re lying for as long as they can to hold onto whatever investor sentiment is still left. \n\n$EWJ $44p 4/17\n\nEDIT: The games are set to start July 24th-August 6th. For when/if they announce the postponement officially....Your gay guess is as good as mine.\n\nI read somewhere that cancelling the \nOlympics could affect their GDP by 1.3%. \nFind the source yourselves because there\u2019s too much \ud83c\udf08porn in my search history to find it.", "created_utc": 1584051208.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhoq5w/2020_tokyo_olympics/", "is_self": true}
