{"id": "fjperq", "title": "Timeline of 2008 Bailout Approval Process on Stock Performance", "selftext": "With mongering on CNBC about the likes of a potential Federal bailout of industries that have been getting pummeled (airlines, cruises, etc), I was curious to dig up some performance of stocks throughout the quick approval process of the bailout in 2008.\n\n**Note:** The bailout in 2008 was focused on banks and the financial sector (with the exception of autos), so performance can only slightly be compared. However, it is still interesting to see how the stock market digested this information.\n\n**The Bailout:** The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, AKA the bank bailout of 2008, created the $700B TARP fund (Troubled Asset Relief Program) that enabled the purchase of toxic financial assets. Additionally, other Fed action took place over this time period involving providing liquidity to financial/money markets, and that is not included as information.\n\n**A Timeline:**\n\n\\- **September 19 2008 (Friday):** $SPY close 124.12\n\n\\- **September 20 2008 (Saturday):** Legislation from Department of Treasury is sent to Congress seeking approval for $700B bailout.\n\n\\- **September 22 2008 (Monday):** $SPY close 121.31 (**-2.26% since 9/19)**\n\n\\- **September 29 2008 (Monday):** House of Representatives **rejected** the initial bailout bill, causing stock market to collapse. $SPY close 111.38 **(-8.18% since 9/22)**\n\n\\- **October 3 2008 (Friday):** $700B TARP fund is approved by the federal government. Includes Capital Repurchase Program targeting banks, purchase of preferred shares of AIG, and bailout of Big Three Auto Companies. $SPY close 110.34 **(-0.93% since 9/29)**\n\n\\- **October 6 2008 (Monday):** $SPY close 104.72 **(-5.09% since 10/3)**\n\n\\- **October 10 2008 (Friday):** $SPY close 88.5 **(-15.49% since 10/6)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Total Results over Bailout Discussion/Approval Period:**\n\nChange in $SPY from 9/19 through 10/10: **$SPY -28.69% (nice)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**tl;dr** Any bailout won't bring calm to financial markets. 4/17 $SPY 200P. Also I hope cruises aren't part of the bailout discussion, that is actually the dumbest not-straight move in history.
