{"id": "f6xs4l", "title": "Lay pipe with Forterra FRTA", "selftext": "Small cap, low volume stock that makes precast concrete pipe.  New CEO back in July 2019.  \n\nVery low volume options with huge spread between bid and ask...  BUT....  There's something for everyone:  IV% is high so good premium for theta gang.  Volatile stock price (tripled since last year) so good for call buyers or put sellers.  Also, no dividend for you short sellers to pay every quarter if you think this run is done.    \n\nIMO, this thing is recession proof because if the economy shits the bed, the government will stimulate with infrastructure spending.  If economy keeps ripping higher with increasing GDP prints, then new construction means laying more pipe.  Plus, ancient stormwater systems, sanitary sewer, potable water distribution will always need to be replaced.  \n\nThey report on Feb 27....  Their earnings are very cyclical because you can't lay pipe in the middle of winter due to horrible weather in northern US/Canada and frost in the ground.  But I'm looking for good 2020 guidance  and a double by year end.   Good luck.", "created_utc": 1582225108, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xs4l/lay_pipe_with_forterra_frta/", "is_self": true}
