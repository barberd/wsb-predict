I think technical analysis is a bunch of voodoo and have never done it in my life BUT it is remarkable how well OJ tracks technicals and it looks like it's gearing up to SPIKE again!! And we got a few NEW PIECES OF INFO to add to the thesis....\n\nSince your boy's last post I sold off just a few calls that turned in the money and some expired OTM which is to be expected, but as the price dipped and ranged the past month I been adding MAX additional cheap long dated way OTM calls so I'm now [long 450 calls](https://imgur.com/eqhPN1n). (Don't forget you can't trust close prices or position value/P&L calculations unless the options trade that day or are in the money.)\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is the latest post [in](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gkeeoy/frozen_oj_broke_recent_high_resistance_up_4_today/)  [a](https://www.reddit.com/user/_KissMeThruThePhone_/comments/gjuqkz/we_juiced_for_those_frozen_oj_futures_options_u/)  [series](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1dse5/frozen_oj_futures_call_options_update_100k_booked/)  [which](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fob7fw/froze_oj_futures_call_options_to_the_moon_600/)  [you](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flzpxz/frozen_concentrate_oj_futures_6_today_long_may/)  [all](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flbinq/l_o_n_g_frozen_concentrate_oj_futures_options/)  [IGNORED](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkyh5i/coronahedge_1_state_prices_nuclear_war_and_frozen/)  to your peril but PLEASE REVIEW FOR CONTEXT!!!!\n\nK i gonna make this REAL quick for you w some new info:\n\n1. [https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonconstable/2020/05/29/the-covid-19-pandemic-is-set-to-push-orange-juice-prices-to-record-levels/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonconstable/2020/05/29/the-covid-19-pandemic-is-set-to-push-orange-juice-prices-to-record-levels/#4c83424394f2)I agree and been tellin u this for a few months!!!\n2. THE [TECHNICALS ARE HOTTT](https://imgur.com/OmZUPOa).\n   1. The 12-day Hull Moving Average is slowly on the upswing and looks about to cross the 24-day. I like Hull because it is faster moving but still smooth and simple to interpret...crossovers aren't as important as changes in direction!More importantly, there is a remarkable level of support, and for the past few weeks we have seen no excursions to the upper half of the projection cone. The last week was a bit dicey but with a MASSIVE buy today that ate up every ask til $1.32, bursting through the intraday 52 week high. Closed up $1.28 but bouncing off the support line and a massive buy through $1.30 is a VERY good sign.\n   2. I think technical analysis is a bunch of garbage but SOMETIMES it becomes self-fulfilling AS LONG as there are longer term fundamental trends (the primary thesis we have been developing) that underly it. OJ trades remarkably fractally and always seems to need a 40-60% retracement before it hits new highs. It's now or never and this chart says why! We've been on the lower half of the support resistance cone for a while but with today's action and the market DUMPING it looks like it's [ZOOM ZOOM!!!](https://imgur.com/3gwctpY) After today's huge 200+ contract buy that blew away the 52 week high intraday, tomorrow or Monday could be a very big day.\n   3. The [weekly chart](https://imgur.com/Rbw98M9) tells you all you need to know, and for the past few months, there's a LOT of green. Implied volatility on the long dated way OTM calls are still relatively low if you can buy on a down day (always use limit orders!) given even at $1.28 we are on the low end of historical price range!!!\n3. NEW IDEA: remember how I explained in my prior posts, how retail demand dynamics are so strange and different (shopping patterns, demand phase-changes, etc) that normal-times projections and estimates and realtime shopping and production data might not give any informational advantage??? And as a result it may be hard to actually tease out how much of a persistent, long term increase in consumer demand the pandemic will generate because there is so much noise? Well MOST of the market for FCOJ is actually institutional (at least in USA and EU, most grocery customers now buy fresh squeezed, though the prices track)...and institutional uses have been SLOW TO REOPEN...BUT...that means a huge chunk of the market still hasn't been adequately assessed in terms of THAT Segment's demand increase. Think about it, sure we know, and have priced in, the fact that grandpa and grandma are going to reach for the OJ at Safeway every time they go to the store instead of 3x a year when they feel like splurging on a \"bad sugary juice\"...BUT since so much of the end user institutional demand is still shut down (cafeterias, airlines, hotels, restaurants, bars, jamba juice, etc. etc. etc.) and will reopen SLOWLY the full impact on whatever demand increase on THAT side of the channel still remains to be seen!Similarly to the early-pandemic shopping patterns at grocery stores being so novel and supply chain issues obfuscating the real increase in demand from that segment, the slow reopening will obfuscate the real increase in demand from the institutional segment---this means we really STILL cannot project how much demand will increase but there will likely be surprise to the upside given the slowness of reopening and how segment-level reopening confounds end-user demand changes within that segment.\n4. FINALLY and this is REAL REAL SIMPLE!!! Domestic consumption from the top world markets, which again has been on a slow but persistent decline for years, [only has to rise to 2015 levels](https://imgur.com/OGE1eGW) because of the coronavirus for total stocks of FCOJ to sold down to historic lows!!! We've got a low-production year in both Brazil and Florida, Florida is looking like a high hurricane risk year, Brazil is LOL fucked COVID19 style and they're the biggest producer....and if the projections in the USDA report screenshotted above ([link](https://downloads.usda.library.cornell.edu/usda-esmis/files/w66343603/00000g55g/kp78h0193/citrus.pdf)) aren't met because one of the above, AND demand increases remember ONLY TO 2015 levels we will for the first time in history be literally OUT OF FCOJ there will be NO MORE literally ZERO INVENTORY LEFT.\n\n[Long 450 FCOJ futures call options July August Sept November mostly deep OTM my mans!!!](https://imgur.com/eqhPN1n)", "created_utc": 1591926343.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h7bjxl/frozen_oj_futures_update_my_mans_it_is_time_to/", "is_self": true}
