And here\u2019s why", "selftext": "Simon Property group is the largest mall operator in the US. Not only that, but they\u2019ve been crashing for over a year now.\n\n\n\nAlso, purely informed speculation, people aren\u2019t going to be going shopping at malls and retail centers that much in the coming months if the exponential super growth of the Coronavirus continues in the US as it has in the other countries. \n\nHere\u2019s a chart for you glue sniffing retards that like books with pictures \n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/TJuUN8B\n\nNot only has this stock been going down for the last *year*, it\u2019s joined the great \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b crash and the recession with the massive daily losses.\n\n\nSo here\u2019s the math for the retards in the room. The stock was already trending down before the bear market. Now it\u2019s crashing too. No matter what you do, a long put literally can\u2019t go tits up, even if the market returns to normal state. Literally free money\n\n$100 5/15 SPG P\n\nNote: I\u2019m not licensed to give retards any advise about what you should invest in. Happy to bear here.
