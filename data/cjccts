I\u2019m a longtime lurker and this is my first post. Bear with me ;).\n\nHistory: I put $25 calls on BYND pre-IPO and missed when it opened at $40. Stock has been an absolute monster ever since. I flirted with the idea of selling $100 calls when the options market opened. Would\u2019ve lost crazy money. Here are my takeaways:\n\nWhy I think it\u2019s a good stock: \n\n1. Innovation: Euphoria aside, it\u2019s a very innovative product. Too much of today\u2019s market is lacking real innovation. Unlike TLRY, a plant-protein meat alternative just didn\u2019t exist. There was no commercial market. Simply put, people haven\u2019t eaten this shit before. Best competitive moat is something completely new. I think it\u2019s safe to say this is 10x better than any vegan alternative. Here\u2019s a good sign: When other companies are marketing your product to their existing customers (see dunkin) you\u2019ve created something very valuable.\n\n2. Management is solid: Look up the origin story- smart guys. Inventors. Seems like a good team. Managing the post-IPO PR well. \n\n3. Market share growth: these massive partnerships they\u2019re securing are expensive but crucial for distribution. And BYND\u2019s biz dev team is crushing go-to-market strategy. Broad distribution, great marketing/hype, well timed into existing health trends. They\u2019re doing the right things.\n\nOk, so you\u2019ve explained the buy above. But at these levels, this has to go down. Come on, 600%? Bro I\u2019m going to short...\n\nMaybe not. Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. This company has extremely high long term growth prospects. For investors looking for protected returns years into the future, BYND represents an extremely disruptive play into an entrenched industry. For Joe Shmoe, this might not make any sense. It\u2019s too overvalued, right? Wrong. Other investors are just playing a different game. These people are bidding up the opportunity to gamble on an innovator. Might be reasonable bet when you are flush cash, but innovation demands very high multiples. \n\n2. Here\u2019s a quick rule: The larger the upround, the more undervalued the stock. Here\u2019s a quick story, but there are countless examples of this playing out in business: Facebooks seed round was 5 million valuation. 8 months later, it raised money at 80 million valuation. 15x in 8 months! 6 months later, that April, they were valued at 585 million. Another 5x! Do you sell? By September, an offer for $1billion from Yahoo!. A yeah later, $15 billion valuation from Microsoft. What\u2019s the takeaway here? when you have momentum, the steeper the valuation, the more undervalued the company. There are differences between the public and private markets, and I\u2019m not claiming BYND is anything close to Facebook, but the general rule is to not short the winning horse. For large players, they\u2019re hunting for monsters that can move the needle. \n\nTakeaway: think twice before thinking of jumping into this game against this kind of momentum. There\u2019s more at work here than you think and there is a high chance of getting burned.\n\nDisclaimer: don\u2019t own any stock. Would if it goes down. Overvalued for us. Just might not be so for them.", "created_utc": 1564412311, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cjccts/alright_i_had_to_do_it_why_bynd_is_fairly_valued/", "is_self": true}
