{"id": "eeay7e", "title": "How To Stonks", "selftext": "As a solo investor, you\u2019re simply not equipped to hedge against the risks of short-term trading. You might diversify your trades or you might even them out, but that only slows the rate at which you lose money. To successfully trade in the short term is to YOLO EVERY SINGLE TIME. Your chances of winning a blackjack hand against the house is about 48%, while your chances of coming up on top against the casino after 10000 hands is 0%. Gambling while the odds are against you is exactly what short-term trading is. If you choose to even out your bets, you might be up for awhile, thinking you are a 0.001% genius, Jimmy Neutron-type motherfuckers but in truth, you\u2019re as retarded as anti-vaxxers, you\u2019re anti-probability. You\u2019re that 65 yr old man at the slot machines playing $0.05 spins, watching the animations, trying to squeeze one last drop of dopamine to save your dying soul, hoping Jesus appears onscreen to save your sorry ass. You might YOLO and lose all your money but you\u2019ll not be left with nothing after 3years of sleepless nights when the odds have finally caught up to you, costing you MONEY, TIME and HEALTH! MY GOD! So be a self-loving individual and go ALL-IN or GO LONG, anything in between means you love losing money like don\u2019t even try to pretend you\u2019re sad when you lose money, you love that shit, own it. Call up your wife and tell her you can finally go on welfare! \n\n\n- Charlie Munkey, Vice Chairman of Brokesure Laughaway", "created_utc": 1577051773, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eeay7e/how_to_stonks/", "is_self": true}
