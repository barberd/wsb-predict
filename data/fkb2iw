We ALREADY KNOW that the volatility will be extremely high and what is happening is that autists with \ud83e\uddfb\u270b combined with logically flawed thought processes keep trying to buy short calls and puts. It simply leads to many trades and anxiety whereas if they had \ud83d\udc8e\u270b they would have made even MORE MONEY if they just bought LONGer PUTS.\n\nPlease don't be an autist. Don't trade 50 times a day just to lose it all rather than holding your PUTS.\n\nAs Stephen Hawkings once said, \"Don't doubt your vibe\" \ud83d\udc8e\u270b always wins. \n\n* IWM 4/24 75p\n* EWG 7/20 20p\n* EWQ 6/19 23p\n* EWU 7/17 22p", "created_utc": 1584472228.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkb2iw/an_abstract_on_why_are_important/", "is_self": true}
