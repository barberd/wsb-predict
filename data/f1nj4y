I HATE IT AND I HATE MYSELF.", "selftext": "Quick introduction: my parents are brokers blah-blah family thing, blah-blah.   \n\nThe point is \"I AM STUPID BLONDE\", okay? Dad always wanted me to learn how they do their stuff and I was a little bit cheating just to escape his shitstorm.  Mom also doesn't get that this is not my thing. So the whole mess is actually not about that... They gave me 10000$ and said that i LITERALLY have to grow it twice. No guide, no nothing. Robinhood link and fuck off papers. Aaaand here is the end of the story \u2014 I fucked up and lost all my money on shitty stocks and now I am:    \n1) broke   \n2) unloved   \n3) damned   \n4) probably homeless     \n\nAnd Holy Grail, I wish somebody could fucking tell me before there are options where I don't have to go unprepared AF to the market.     \nNo money before, no money after, just test your shit and make insights. I mean I\u2019ve heard a lot about different simulators... But as we all remember, I don\u2019t get any of these schemes and maths.  Where should I go and what should I do\u2026..    \nFirst, my friend came to me with a few options like, as I said before, simulators, so we started to search on the internet if there is an easier way to try my luck. I started to search through App Store, Google Play, startup platforms, etc. Have you guys ever heard of Fantasy Invest? Cause I didn't. And today while scrolling Product Hunt I've noticed their launch page. Of course, after all these years I have a mental trigger on words like \"finance\", \"options\", \"invest\" etc.  That's the reason why I reacted. I am truly sorry about all this shit around the post, but I swear, I don't know what to do and why am I so damn stupid. So tell me more, did you use any apps like this one or anything else to grow your skills?  I know you hate here newbies and babinvestors.  \n\nBut GOD PLEASE SEND HELP.", "created_utc": 1581323751, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f1nj4y/fuck_the_stock_market_i_hate_it_and_i_hate_myself/", "is_self": true}
