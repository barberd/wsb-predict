{"id": "egkvve", "title": "LONG PTON", "selftext": "Ok so hear me out, my boomer manager and I got talking today about stocks and one thing led to another before I asked him what he thought of peloton. His eyes FUCKING LIT UP and he said his wife has been nagging him to get one of those. He's your typical upper echilon 6 figures plus salary with multi million in properties type of boomer. This PTON machine is clearly not designed for us bottom of the barrel type of folks. It's for rich ppl who dont give a shit about a 2k bike. It's a drop in a bucket for them as long as that keeps the wifey happy.", "created_utc": 1577500422, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/egkvve/long_pton/", "is_self": true}
