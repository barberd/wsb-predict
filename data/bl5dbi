Let me explain \u2014 and take note, I\u2019m no genius -- this is just quick \u201cpen and ink\u201d analysis points:  \n\n\n1. **WE HAVE TIME.** Unlike JPOW\u2019s fuckery on Wednesday, Trump\u2019s announcement today presents us an opportunity to not make emotional decisions and strategically map out our plays for the week and beyond. At the very least,   consider that a true positive.\n\n2. **PLAYING BOTH SIDES.** The Chinese delegation is threatening to cancel trade talks on the back of Trump\u2019s tweets. Now, this is just a threat, but it also gives us an opportunity to set up our strategy. For me, the Chinese could cancel their DC delegation visit this week, which will piss of the markets even more. We may not know what the delegation wants to do until Monday, maybe even Tuesday. So, as the market tanks tomorrow, we can begin averaging in calls that have the potential to build in gains lost on Monday. Consider this with SPY/QQQ/XSD calls at end of the week, or possibly mid-way next week. In case the Chinese do cancel the delegation visit, consider wide-ranging OTM puts on those indexes \u2014 as the market will not be pleased at what may be considered Trump updates that were put out in bad faith.\n\n3. **DONT FORGET INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES.** Tracking individual companies with large Chinese sector exposure. Some of the top companies include Wynn Resorts, Qualcomm, Micron, AMD, Intel, WD, and Nvidia. The same strategy for individual companies apply to item number 2 above with a call or put strategy. .\n\n4. **SUMMER MONTHS STRATEGY.** It may not hurt to start believing the US/China trade deal just doesn\u2019t come to fruition. If this is the case, we know May will be a huge sell off, if not, correction month. Start thinking 2-3 months down the road after the dust settles. Where will the profit plays be? What ERs will be coming up? What\u2019s the future of oil look like with a correction? Other things.\n\nJust some thoughts friends. But be thankful this announcement didn\u2019t come intra-trading. We have time to pause, reflect, and strategize.", "created_utc": 1557103515, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bl5dbi/some_initial_thoughts_on_the_new_tariffs/", "is_self": true}
