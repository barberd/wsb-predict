{"id": "gozyec", "title": "PENN Covered Call help for a noob who got lucky", "selftext": "I\u2019ve been long on Penn and am still very bullish on them long term. I have 2,000 shares at $15.00 average cost. I personally think they can get to $50+ by January 2021 but am willing to cash out anywhere between $40-$50.\n\nGiven the rally this week, I was going to start selling covered calls at a $40-$50 strike price for January 2021 expiration. My thinking...if the rally continues I can just cash out comfortably with extra cash from the option sale, if it falls I can take the proceeds and buy more shares with my call premiums again or buy the calls to close the position profitably. \n\nIt feels like I\u2019m playing with house money as it is and the only downside I see here is if the stock explodes above $50 but I would\u2019ve made so much I wouldn\u2019t really feel bad.\n\nIs there anything else I should consider or any flaw in this logic before I do it?\n\nEDIT: The stock is currently at $30 in case anyone hadn\u2019t been keeping track", "created_utc": 1590214107.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gozyec/penn_covered_call_help_for_a_noob_who_got_lucky/", "is_self": true}
