(UGI - $2.90 to $46.52)\n\nNotable Put Activity\n\nSome unusual put activity (~48:1 over calls) is being seen in iShares J.P. Morgan USD Emerging Markets Bond ETF (EMB + $0.60 to $113.15) which is primarily being driven by a couple of blocks that simultaneously traded on the September 20th expiration:\n\n109.00 put (open interest is 2,001) \u2013 a 5K block traded for $0.24 when the bid/ask spread was $0.15 x $0.50\n108.00 put (open interest is 44) \u2013 a 5K block traded for $0.16 when the bid/ask spread was $0.10 x $0.40\nIt\u2019s difficult to be certain (because of where the trades took place within their respective bid/ask spreads) but it appears that a $1.00-wide bear put spread was established for a net debit of $0.08 (x 5K contracts x 100 multiplier, excluding commissions) which would suggest that the block trader believes that EMB will close below the break-even price of $108.92 at expiration.\n\nFastenal Co. (FAST + $0.39 to $28.95): Puts are outpacing calls better than 6:1 which is primarily being driven by a 5K block that was bought on the August 16th 30.00 put for $1.00 when the bid/ask spread was $0.85 x $1.05 (open interest is 4,033). We know this block is a new position and we can assume the intent is bearish in nature since the trade took place above the midpoint of the bid/ask spread.\n\nVolume Signals     \n\nCharter Communications Inc. (CHTR + $1.45 to $381.19): Option volume is running at over 8x the daily average of 308 contracts which is primarily being driven by four mid-sized blocks that simultaneously traded on the September 20th expiration:\n\n425.00 call - A 660 block traded for $1.11 when the bid/ask spread was $0.75 x $1.40 (open interest is 14)\n415.00 call - A 660 block traded for $2.03 when the bid/ask spread was $1.65 x $2.50 (open interest is 35)\n345.00 put - A 660 block traded for $3.67 when the bid/ask spread was $3.40 x $4.00 (open interest is 118)\n335.00 put - A 660 block traded for $2.69 when the bid/ask spread was $2.30 x $3.00 (open interest is 504)\nWe know these four blocks are new positions and it appears that a short iron condor (long 425.00 call/short 415.00 call/short 345.00 put/long 335.00 put) was established for a net credit of $1.90 (x 660 contracts x 100 multiplier, excluding commissions) which suggests that the block trader believes that CHTR will close between $345.00 and $415.00 at expiration (in which the entire $125,400 premium, excluding commissions, will be retained).  \n\nL Brands Inc. (LB - $0.04 to $23.73): A 5K block was sold on the September 6th 20.00 put at the bid price of $0.50 (open interest is 0). We know this block is a new position given the open interest figure and we can assume that the block trader either believes that LB will close above the $20.00 level or is comfortable taking a long 500,000 share position in LB in the event that the stock closes below $20.00 at expiration.   \n\nElanco Animal Health Inc. (ELAN + $0.67 to $32.48): Option volume is running at roughly 30x the daily average of 171 contracts which is primarily being driven by a 4,700 contract block that was sold on the September 20th 30.00 put for $0.60 (open interest is 0). We know this block is a new position given the open interest figure and we can assume that the block trader either believes that ELAN will close above the $30.00 level or is comfortable taking a long 470,000 share position in ELAN in the event that the stock closes below $30.00 at expiration.   \n\nGauging Volatility\n\nThe CBOE Volatility Index (VIX - 2.64 to 21.95) has been in the red all day today (intraday range is 20.83-22.87) as equity markets are higher across the board around the mid-day mark today (DJI + 98, SPX + 12, COMPX + 40). VIX option volume has been above average today at 427,126 contracts (#3 on the top 10 most actives list) and the activity has been definitively call-biased (the volume put/call ratio is currently 0.24). The most actively traded contract is the November 20th 35.00 call as volume is 41,628 versus open interest of 43,302.", "created_utc": 1565119081, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cmv09s/options_market_8619/", "is_self": true}
