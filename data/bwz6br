{"id": "bwz6br", "title": "Fuck options, 3 Dividend Stocks for 2019", "selftext": "We all love dividend stocks, as they give us a steady and \"free\" income that can either be withdrawn or reinvested. As a result, I composed a list of my 3 most favorite dividend stocks for 2019.\n\n1. Abbvie (ABBV): By far Abbvie's most popular drug, and in fact, the best selling pharmaceutical product right now is Humira. However, what could be concerning for Abbvie is Takeda\u2019s Entyvio, which has beaten Humira in a study. This is not a concern for Abbvie though. Risankizumab, or Riza for short. Riza is currently in the making and could potentially be a huge hit for Abbvie once released. Its target drugs are similar to Humira and can easily beat Entyvio. With Riza is also working on Upadacitinib, or Upa, a drug that is in phase 3 for the majority of the diseases it is set to help. Upa also has similar target diseases as Riza and Humira. Abbvie pays a quarterly dividend that equals up to 5.49% yearly. They have been growing this dividend for 6 years and it has seen a 17% 5-year growth rate, which is incredibly fast.\n2. AT&amp;T (T): The acquisition of Time Warner by AT&amp;T allowed them to get access to an immense variety of TV channels including CNN, HBO, Turner, Time, Sports Illustrated, and Warner Bros. AT&amp;T current liabilities stands at 64 billion dollars and their long term liabilities stands at 167 billion dollars. This is an enormous amount but has started to become better as Randall L Stephenson, the CEO of AT&amp;T, is determined to get rid of AT&amp;T\u2019s sky-high debt. AT&amp;T offers a massive dividend of 6.39% annually and has been growing this dividend for 35 years. \n3. Leggett and Platt (LEG): Leggett and Platt is a company that sells a huge variety of materials used for homes, cars, and planes. This sector is relatively stable in terms of price movements, as we are always going to need furniture, beds, floors, and wires. So it\u2019s not a business that has the potential to go away overnight. The stock offers a pretty enormous dividend of 4.34% annually. This dividend has been growing over the past 46 years, which is pretty impressive, as they still kept their dividend up even in the recessions. As far as value goes, their PE ratio is almost identical to the sector median, which suggests that it is not overvalued or undervalued. However, when comparing the PE ratio of Leggett and Platt to its history we can see that the stock is undervalued from that perspective.\n\nIf you don't enjoy reading this extremely long text, I created a video that goes over these stocks in more depth: [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txd8gYLYeGs)", "created_utc": 1559713950, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bwz6br/fuck_options_3_dividend_stocks_for_2019/", "is_self": true}
