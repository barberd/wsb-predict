I played all FDs and lost it all. Yes, I was bummed out for losing 12k  but it wasn\u2019t exactly because of the money. It was all the time and hard work I put in which caused stress and turned into a failed project. As a rookie trader I wasn\u2019t used the feeling of watching money literally disappear. I wanted to test myself and failed at it which didn\u2019t give me confidence to invest the large amount of money I had saved up which was the original plan. I said fuck it though and gave it another shot. I wanted to do things different and part was only trading shares. I got 3:1 margin and decided that was risky enough on its own. I\u2019m only writing this because I love this community and the last thing I want is to be known as a fraud.  I\u2019d like to continue to share my success and failures here but if I\u2019m not welcomed then that\u2019s that. Am I good to carry on?", "created_utc": 1563942153, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ch3c1q/mod_verification_as_asked_ive_been_getting_a_lot/", "is_self": true}
