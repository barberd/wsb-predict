{"id": "g1lh7d", "title": "How to make money in this market (just ride the waves)", "selftext": "So I've been doing a DD into this current market and realized one thing......all the money I have lost ($30k or 1/3 of my total positions) has been because I am trying to predict the market instead of just reacting to what this market is already doing.  If I had just waited 3 days after the first crash when the indicators said so and bought puts reacting to what it was doing, I would've made a killing.  If I would have started buying calls after this market started surging, I would've made even more.  All the volatility and MACD indicators are working just fine, so use them.  \n\nWe all know this thing is probably coming back down.  Might retest the lows, might not.  Might blow right through them.  We don't know, much less when.  So stop trying to predict and when the momentum indicators tell you to, just jump on that wave baby and let it carry you.\n\n$60k cash gang\n\nEdit:  Dumbed down, don't need to understand version.  Just set up MACD on your chart (make sure it is set to \"Daily\") and look up $SPY.  When that bitch goes sub (-10.0) divergence, sell preasure is in.", "created_utc": 1586927232.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1lh7d/how_to_make_money_in_this_market_just_ride_the/", "is_self": true}
