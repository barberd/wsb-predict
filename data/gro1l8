The company has been consistently losing money since it debuted on its IPO.  Well over 90% of its COGS is from China.  A looming trade war is going to impact them hard.  I am surprised this stock is not covered more on WSB considering how it is basically has great potential to become a meme stock.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[CMF turning negative, can you believe it hit a low of $21.70 in March?  ](https://preview.redd.it/pqlelv347c151.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e13c99cd06a9fd92fa05e01547893532d0295a9)\n\n[https://stockcharts.com/freecharts/pnf.php?c=yext,PWTADANRNO\\[PA\\]\\[D\\]\\[F1!3!!!2!20\\]](https://stockcharts.com/freecharts/pnf.php?c=yext,PWTADANRNO[PA][D][F1!3!!!2!20]) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nInsiders dumping the stock in a sea of red.

And one of W's main product lines is outdoor lawn and patio furniture.   This also coincides with the summer moving season for renters and house buyers.  If sales are good then the stock could potentially rally higher and hit an uptrend again.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: No position in $W yet - waiting to enter on a rally.
