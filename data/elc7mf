{"id": "elc7mf", "title": "I'm a physician and I'm long KRTX. DD inside.", "selftext": "Xanomeline is a drug proven in prior phase 2 studies by Eli Lilly all the way back in 1997 to be very effective in treating psychosis in Alzheimer's and Schizophrenia patients. However, it was dropped due to unwanted side effects from its muscarnic agonist effects (parasympathetic things like vomiting, salivation, diarrhea etc.). But, drugs do exist that are antimuscarinic, but don't cross the blood brain barrier to cause CNS effects (like benadryl makes you drowsy).  You could theoretically combine them together to counteract the side effects. Trospium is one such drug; so, Karuna therapeutics was formed in 2009 to combine xanomeline and trospium as KarXT, and study it in schizophrenia/alzheimer's.\n\nPhase 2 topline results were released in November 2019 and were extremely positive, hitting hits primary endpoint. It showed PANSS score at five weeks of treatment was 11.6 point reduction compared to placebo. PANSS is a well validated scoring system to measure reduction of symptoms of psychosis. To compare how effective this is to the best selling atypical antipsychotic that already exists, see the drug Abilify (https://www.aristadahcp.com/efficacy-pivotal-trial). That drug achieved PANSS reduction of 14.7. So why would psychiatrists potentially pick KarXT over Abilify and similar existing antipsychotics? Because antipsychotics, as dopamine antagonists, have horrible side effects. They can cause disturbing extrapyramidal effects like tardive dyskinesia ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUr8ltXh1Pc&amp;t=32s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUr8ltXh1Pc&amp;t=32s)). They can also make you fat, raise your cholesterol. Muscarinic agents like KarXT do not cause any of this and the phase 2 trial further demonstrates:  No evidence of somnolence, extrapyramidal side effects or weight gain compared to placebo. \n\nAnd finally, of course; the Phase 2 results showed KarXT was very well tolerated as opposed to the Phase 2 Eli Lilly studies back in 1990s. There were similar discontinuation rates between KarXT (20%) and placebo (21%). \n\nReward: \n\nBest case scenario, is compare this to the drug Abilify (aripiprazole) by BMY. They hit 7.4 billion in peak sales in 2011. As the best selling atypical antipsychotic used to treat the same things KarXT is targeting but with far worse side effects, if KarXT becomes a similar blockbuster and becomes favored by clinicians for its better adverse effect profile, then if this shit hits global peak sales of over 7 billion in the future, we can apply a conservative biotech industry average of 3x multiple to sales to generate a market cap of 21 billion. That would take years (like by 2030) but represent 1100% upside to the current price. More realistically, I would expect the company gets bought out well before then.\n\nAlso more realistcally, other actual analysts such as from Citi project peak unadjusted sales estimate in schizophrenia to $4.7B from $2.3B.  But, that is for schizophrenia alone. However, if KarXT eventually also proves to be effective in ameliorating psychosis with Alzheimer's, expect the peak sales estimate to climb towards that 7 billion.\n\nRisks: \n\nYour investment goes to zero because biotech.   \n\n\nFinancials: \n\nvery solid. After phase 2 topline results, a public offering of 2.6 million shares priced at $96 a share should have added roughly 250 million in cash. Their 3rd quarter 2019 financial update showed cash balance of 161 million and they projected that amount ALONE was enough to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second half of 2021. This includes multiple clinical and development milestones INCLUDING a Phase 3 clinical trial of KarXT in psychosis related to schizophrenia. So, at a cash pile of 411 million to start in 2020, we should expect a low probabilty of further offerings or dilution to the stock in the near future.\n\nTldr: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKRTX is severely underpriced relative to its significantly derisked pipeline drug KarXT. You can observe its stock price has climbed everyday of actual high volume with the big boys buying but has been dumped by MM/algo/panicked retail investors on low volume days. Its public offering price at NINETY SIX dollars a share in November 2019 after phase 2 results means that should be the price FLOOR for this stock at this stage. That is a 33.6% upside to yesterday\u2019s close.", "created_utc": 1578407189, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/elc7mf/im_a_physician_and_im_long_krtx_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
