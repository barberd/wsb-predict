Media\u2019s trying to make it seem like he\u2019s home shooting the shit watching Tiger King and downplaying the severity of actually recovering from this.  Truth is not only are Kung Flu patients taking up intensive care units, they\u2019re flooding rehab facilities after they\u2019ve recovered and will require tons of care after the fact.  Which brings me to my final point - home care companies - the final tendie to be plucked out of the recovery process.\n\nTLDR\n\nSPY 200P 5/1 - Cuomo lieing to your faces\n\nAMED 185C 5/15  - Home care (tri-state)", "created_utc": 1585976966.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/funux0/ny_patient_zero_not_home_from_hospital/", "is_self": true}
