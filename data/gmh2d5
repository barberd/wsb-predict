Come dance in the sun with me on SNDE as this \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 to 20 dollars tomorrow. From its current price at 2.55!!!\n\nHere's why, Oil isn't going negative again, that's a once in a lifetime event. Never should have happened, never happening again. SNDE majorly tanked right around the beginning of the year right when Oil catered. We're they doing great before? No, but all those stocks are way over bought. I'm talking about one that isn't, yet. \n\nThese guys have been making hedges to help protect themselves against a down turn. Hedge at 55 dollars to sell right before the down turn.\n\nhttps://sundance.irpass.com/profiles/investor/PDFview.aspx?b=2370&ID=92249&m=rl&g=1186\n\nSo this is the part where I include all my other research. However all that shit is worth about as much as anything in this economy, so just know but just know I've consulted my oracles, and they've confirmed just like they confirmed my mid March puts this will print. So if you like me bought puts when you should have bought calls, and you missed the RCL 20% jump over the weekend, this is your chance. All you tanker whores should take a page out of the winning playbook and switch sides before its too late. \n\nNot selling you? OK I did a post over on investing for those guys and they weren't impressed either.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/gkps4i/sundance_energy_dd/\n\nI bet you won't be impressed when this moons tomorrow and you didn't fucking buy some shares that cost 2.55 a piece.\n\nEdited and resubmitted because my tard self tried to post this while walking the Dog and messed up the ticker. Also I don't think enough of you will buy into the above to move this bad boy so cool your jets if you thinks that's what I am about.", "created_utc": 1589859968.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gmh2d5/sundance_dd/", "is_self": true}
