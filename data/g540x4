The company is currently at $23.79 and the markets have discounted the company based on pessimism and uncertainty of when things will revert back to normal\n2. Unlike most U.S Airlines, Delta does not hedge fuel costs while most airlines are locked in at say fucking $67 dollars a barrel. Delta acquired a refinery in 2012 to produce jet fuel for its fleet (of which crude is an input so lower prices will lower cost)\n3. Oil prices have just shit the bed, and Delta is in the perfect position to capitalize on extremely low oil prices for future profitability\n4. I wager that in the earnings call conference, mgmt will have comments on how much they can potentially save\n5. DAL benefitting from lower fuel prices will free up capital for future capex and fleet expansion  and investors will overlook low earnings (which has been \"priced in\")\n\n**Disclaimer**: Not sure how airlines negotiate these future contracts especially in this fucked up macroeconomic environment but due to oversupply of oil from economic slowdown, prices should remain low.\n\n**P.S.** Royal Caribbean, which also does not hedge fuel prices may move once markets react to DAL's release.", "created_utc": 1587425780.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g540x4/dal_stock_will_fly_postearnings_dal_424_35_call/", "is_self": true}
