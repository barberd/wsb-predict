I personally think they will do really well. Computers are being bought out left and right. Also people working from home are also buying printers, and ink as well which is high profit.  HP also has their instant ink subscriptions which makes them good money as well. Demand is extremely high for monitors, laptops, desktops, and printers so they should crush the earnings report. Yet the stock is trending downward. While Dell their rival is trending upwards.", "created_utc": 1590521593.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gr3vvs/hpq_earnings_report/", "is_self": true}
