TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nPositions - \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mrg4f3ov3on41.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae54d459fbbfff345b027a4147b87fa183a290fc\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xcozxn1y3on41.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=e097d1d69ddde5170747e824aa1b32cf23554d35\n\nIn June, Eldorado and Ceasars announced a merger/buyout of CZR for $8.40 plus .0899 shares of ERI. The deal is scheduled to close in the first half of 2020 and the contract doesn't have an out for Force Majeure or anything similar. CZR is currently trading at $4.5, well below the value of the deal. As of 2pm EST 3/19 there is a 200% return to buy shares and hold until the deal closes. The initial end date to close the deal is June 25, but [a NY Times article](https://nypost.com/2020/03/11/eldorados-acquisition-of-caesars-may-be-in-trouble-due-to-coronavirus/) points to efforts to close the deal ASAP.  [This Seeking Alpha article is also an interesting read.](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4331531-eldorado-resorts-now-interesting)\n\nCZR is trading way below the merger value due to the risk of the deal falling through. There have been a few articles that have stated the financial penalties for abandoning this deal, but the merger contract is the best place to research this ( [http://www.snl.com/Cache/IRCache/ce066ae36-d2d9-28c3-e48b-b30ab32744fa.html#d767286dex21.htm](http://www.snl.com/Cache/IRCache/ce066ae36-d2d9-28c3-e48b-b30ab32744fa.html#d767286dex21.htm))\n\n\"If the Merger Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances relating to changes in the recommendation of the board of directors of Eldorado in favor of the issuance of shares of Eldorado Common Stock in the Merger or in certain circumstances following the failure of Eldorado\u2019s stockholders to approve such issuance, then Eldorado will be required to pay Caesars a termination fee of approximately $154.9\u00a0million. In addition, each party will be obligated to reimburse the other party\u2019s expenses for an amount not to exceed $50\u00a0million if the Merger Agreement is terminated because of the failure to obtain the required approval of such party\u2019s stockholders (creditable against any termination fee that may subsequently be paid by such party)........\n\nThe Merger Agreement also provides that Eldorado will be obligated to pay a termination fee of approximately $836.8\u00a0million to Caesars if the Merger Agreement is terminated (i)\u00a0due to a law or order relating to gaming or antitrust laws that prohibits or permanently enjoins the consummation of the transactions, (ii)\u00a0because the required regulatory approvals were not obtained prior to the End Date or (iii)\u00a0due to Parent willfully and materially breaching certain obligations with respect to the actions required to be taken by Parent to obtain required antitrust approvals. \"\n\nWhether Eldorado bails or not, it's clear that Eldorado is going to finish the regulatory process on this either way. There is also a 1/3 cent per day penalty for every day past March 25th that the regulatory process isn't completed, so I expect this deal to close or cancel fairly quickly.\n\nOne big question that I can't answer is why isn't Eldorado buying as many shares as it can, driving the price up to $8.4, which is what they are paying anyways? One answer might be that they are not legally allowed to do that, another might be that they will, but right before the deal happens (so that they don't trigger other investors that the deal is 100% happening. I have spent some time reading the merger contract (linked above) but it's a lot of text. Maybe one of you knows or can find out in the contract whether or not ERI can buy shares on the open market?\n\nThere are  682,161,838 shares of CZR and a market cap of \\~3 billion. Much of that is owned by institutions, but with price falling every day it is clear that people and institutions alike are selling. ERI agreed to pay $8.40 cash per share, a 5.7B value before the .0899 shares.\n\nAnother nice thing is that the risk should be limited, unless CZR goes to 0. These are unprecedented times, so while that is possible, it is certainly unlikely.  I don't really think that anyone in the deal or currently lending to them wants them to go to 0, but in this market I could see it happening so fast that nobody can stop it. One example of a partner that probably wants this deal to go through is VICI, the company that is going to own some of the strip properties and lease them back to Eldorado. The reason that i believe that they are still happy with the deal is that they have put/call rights in the contract. If I understand the call/put contract properly, VICI can force Eldorado to purchase the properties in 2022-2024 if it is better for them. JP Morgan should also be okay with the debt that they have committed to because they have to put their money to work somewhere, and the gaming industry is historically a highly profitable industry.\n\nTL;DR - Eldorado Resorts (ERI) is purchasing Caesars Entertainment (CZR) for $8.40 cash plus .0899 shares of Eldorado per share. Caesars is trading at $4.5. Purchasing shares and holding until the deal closes gives \\~200% return ($4.50 for \\~$9.10). This is a good price for the risk of the deal not closing. There are too many companies with too much exposure to let this deal fall through. Buy CZR and hold until the deal closes for a great short term return.", "created_utc": 1584640586.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flefok/caesars_and_eldorado_arbitrage_opportunity/", "is_self": true}
