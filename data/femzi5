I bought some calls after I saw his DD and I am 50% up so far.\n\nAfter reading his DD, I did some more research on GIS to see if the company actually has good potential to go up.\n\n**SO, here is my DD :**\n\n***ABOUT THE COMPANY***\n\nIt is a global leading food company that serves us the food that we love such as Cheerios, Haagen Daz ice-cream, Nature Valley, Annie's, Yoplait yoghurt, Betty Crocker, Pillbury, Yoki and many more. During 2019, they generated net sales of $16.9 billion.

Expected EPS for this quarter is **77 cents** and it seems like they will probably beat that considering they mostly had an **EPS of 80 or more.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAccording to [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/consumer-defensive-stocks/?utm_campaign=quote-yahoo&utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral&yptr=yahoo), General Mills (GIS) is the one of the best value consumer staple stock with a 12 month Trailing **P/E Ratio of 15.5** and a market cap of **$32.6B.**\n\n**This stock is expected to go up especially once people start stocking up Cereals & Canned Foods.**\n\nThe stock is currently trading at **54.77.** The calls for **3/20** **60$c's** are **cheap** right now. **Expected earnings on 3/18 premarket.**\n\n**TL;DR -  60$c | 3/20**\n\nMy position : [https://imgur.com/9IrRlxp](https://imgur.com/9IrRlxp?fbclid=IwAR1DWmHvpUb7M4pVSyL2wF3QmBV4i1hiqHICN52rqCC5GuOjod3FfYF6FtM)\n\n**Disclaimer : I am not responsible for your trades.
