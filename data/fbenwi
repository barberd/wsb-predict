{"id": "fbenwi", "title": "Weekly Round Up and What's Next", "selftext": "What a week. What happened? With the explosion of cases in Italy and South Korea, the markets finally took into consideration that the coronavirus is indeed a global pandemic. As the autists here are well aware, the WHO is actively paid off by the Chinese government and other interest groups, see global pandemic fund. This led to one of the fastest sell off's since the 2008 financial crisis, with the S&amp;P hitting lows from October 2019!\n\nWhat about the coronavirus in the United States? CDC testing criteria were artificially set high in order to suppress case count. This is called patient under investigation (PUI) criteria. The requirements for a diagnostic test were to have symptoms of coronavirus and the patient either i) traveled to china or ii) directly came into contact with an infected patient. You can't have a case if you don't test for it, \\*taps head\\*. The US has conducted less than 600 cases as of last week, whereas South Korea is conducting more than 10,000/day. \n\n[https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/t0228-COVID-19-update.html](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/t0228-COVID-19-update.html)\n\n&gt;And here in the US, \u00a0in our local we have done about 500 in our local patients...\n\n[S&amp;P \\/ES Futures 1 Yr\\/1 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/58qk89viuvj41.png?width=1966&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e18cef80a5c69b90d9677a6887f1bcbac1ce97de)\n\nIf stock markets are falling, then why are other safe haven assets such as gold and even meme metals like palladium falling? \n\n[\\/GC Gold Futures 1 Yr\\/1 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/ahfiw1jruvj41.png?width=1966&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3874915205b7274b9af8dd0922a8df21da6c0ad0)\n\n[\\/PA Palladium Futures 1 Yr\\/1 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/8m0ziwk2vvj41.png?width=1966&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e545982358efda8f308e437b78dced33c140ebfe)\n\nDuring extreme financial stress, people sell other assets such as metals and commodities in order to liquidate capital to cover other positions. Extremely strong sell off's happen during after lunch, starting around 1:30pm EST due to margin calls and forced liquidation. Thus, people sell traditionally other safe haven assets in order to cover capital requirements. This same pattern happened during the 2008 financial crisis.\n\n[\\/GC Gold 15 Yr\\/1 Week Chart with S&amp;P overlaid in purple in the same time frame](https://preview.redd.it/ucpk716svvj41.png?width=1966&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b614ec51bd9905b4ba60706cd7ac0ec458c055e)\n\nWhat about other macro indicators such as oil and bonds? WTI oil has crashed below $50/barrel despite OPEC proceeding to do more than 1 million barrel/day production cut to create a price floor. Given the current situation and fears about a global decline in energy demand, it is increasingly likely that there currently is not a bottom in oil, and we may even see prices below $40/barrel. \n\n[\\/CL Light sweet crude oil futures 1Yr\\/1Day](https://preview.redd.it/oyo1bn00xvj41.png?width=1966&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84ff63f3c7192b7b73203be2d2101e5222f5718f)\n\n[TLT iShares 20+ year treasury bond ETF 1 Yr\\/1 D](https://preview.redd.it/w6efniivyvj41.png?width=1966&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05b4c90e1ab35ccaef9673d9a1554060673b28f0)\n\nTreasury bonds are considered one of the safest assets as they have the backing of the US government. Treasury bond demand has been artificially high since the 2008 financial crisis and introduction of Dodd-Frank act, since MM need to satisfy margin requirements with treasury bonds as collateral in order to trade certain derivatives. This has led issues to the repo market, with the Fed doing Not QE. With increasing pressure from the global pandemic, troubles in the EU/asia, demand is higher than ever, creating lower yields. Will we see yields of &lt;1% on the 10 year treasury note?\n\nWhat's next? \n\nCDC has updated testing requirements now that cases have been identified in California, Oregon, and now finally people that have no exposure source identified. \n\n[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-criteria.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-criteria.html)\n\n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/a-second-case-of-coronavirus-found-through-spread-in-california/2020/02/28/ae53c93a-5a77-11ea-9b35-def5a027d470\\_story.html](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/a-second-case-of-coronavirus-found-through-spread-in-california/2020/02/28/ae53c93a-5a77-11ea-9b35-def5a027d470_story.html)\n\nThe Fed has indicated that they will be stepping in as necessary in order to stabilize markets. While there may be a quick large bounce in the short-term future (rate cuts), coronavirus outbreaks will be identified in the United States with increasing diagnostic testing. If the USA is not able to effectively mitigate outbreaks, despite central banks collaborating to ease financial stress, there is still major downside risk in the markets over the coming months. Another major catalyst is Japan and the 2020 summer olympics.", "created_utc": 1582992658, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fbenwi/weekly_round_up_and_whats_next/", "is_self": true}
