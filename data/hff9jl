{"id": "hff9jl", "title": "UPS Puts", "selftext": "Hey guys just wondering if anyone taken a look at the UPS chart and the strong resistance level at around $110.00 that it is at right now. It is at 66 on the RSI on the 6 month chart so it is close to being overbought. I am bearish on the market in general with what is goin on in Florida, California, Texas etc... but want to know what everyone else thinks about a put option play maybe $105.00 8/21 and hold for a week or two until it retraces back near $100. I\u2019m new to this but just lookin for other perspectives and opinions.", "created_utc": 1593055836.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hff9jl/ups_puts/", "is_self": true}
