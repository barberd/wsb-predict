Credit to /u/mgr4 and others who helped contribute to this DD through discussion and research\n\nI\u2019m sure most of you degenerates are too lazy to read them, much less figure out what\u2019s going on, so feel free to skip to the tl;dr. But for those of you who care, here\u2019s my take on things. I wanted to post because this is a rare good opportunity on WSB, and also because it needs to be explained more simply, with greater examination of the details, so that my fellow gamblers can understand.\n\nI told people to buy PCG back in December almost six months ago [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e7h72m/pcg\\_growing\\_more\\_and\\_more\\_likely\\_to\\_exit/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e7h72m/pcg_growing_more_and_more_likely_to_exit/) when it was under 10$ and looked like a potential bankruptcy exit was possible. It ran to 18$ by February on the idea that PCG would exit bankruptcy and made mucho tendies. If you played this and made money, great, if not don't fret, you got another shot rabbit, don't choke this time\n\nJust this morning Barclays upgraded to overweight, earlier UBS upgraded to 15$ PT based on exiting bankruptcy likely\n\nToday we got a once in a lifetime do-over thanks to COVID where we are at the final precipice of bankruptcy exit, its priced at 11$ (and rising with upgrades each week), the final votes are the next two weeks and things are all looking positive.\n\n**TL;DR PCG going towards 20$ by end of June, Shares = free $$, 5/29 calls near 14.50/15 are high risk targets, 6/19 calls towards 15$ are less risky and mucho money, september 20C are free money, buy, sell on run up next 6 weeks and IV spikes**\n\n**PCG - A Load of Hot Shit**\n\nPCG is a CA power company that did a bunch of naughty things and some homes / people burnt up (CA is a tinderbox come summertime). This resulted in PCG having to account for huge insurance [claims](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/2019/01/21/as-30b-in-wildfire-claims-bankrupt-pge-california-wonders-who-will-pay-after-the-next-conflagration/#5a60d3c72699), which obviously sent them into bankruptcy. The share price understandably plummeted:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4vir721wnxy41.png?width=773&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0c47db89008359b791a0d1765969f4c52d4a433\n\nNow, the more observant among you may also note rather large spikes in volume in Jan 2019 and December / Jan 2020, followed by the share price rising significantly. What caused these spikes, you may ask? Well, the chance that PCG could come out of bankruptcy in a manner that would be beneficial to the shareholders of PCG\u2019s equity. However, both times the plan was delayed, resulting in lower confidence and the share price dropping.\n\nClearly, if these had been actual exits, PCG would have skyrocketed\u2014we\u2019re seeing the price hit $17-20+ on *proposals and rumors alone*. That\u2019s because PCG is monopolistic in California, and would be an absolute beast given two things: 1. It could exit on semi-favorable terms and 2. It could ensure, in some way, that it wouldn\u2019t get fucked over by a fire yet again through enforcement of measures to reduce risk (and a nice tidy 20B+ wildfire fund that the state provides to help utilities reduce the burden of paying for fire liabilities).\n\nSimply look at the following screenshot of its income statement these last few years, and imagine what it would look like if \u201cunusual items\u201d (give you one guess as to what those are) were removed:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i2r4y3vxnxy41.png?width=660&format=png&auto=webp&s=d86e04b205546dcce59fcc720a0ab11bce57082d\n\nGood news, degens! The bankruptcy exit plans are underway again, and they do the two major things mentioned above. PG&E is allowed to remain solvent and continue generating huge revenues ($4.3 billion + in Q12020 and even more in Covid times as people stay home). Second, assuming PG&E [exits by June 30th](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/02/18/pge-jolted-billions-quarter-loss-wildfire-costs-bankruptcy/)\u2014a provision designed to help speed the process along\u2014they\u2019ll have access to $20+ billion in protection from a CA fund for future wildfire liabilities. So why will the bankruptcy exit occur now, when it didn\u2019t in the past? Well, as Sir John Templeton once said when noting the four most promising words in investing, \u201cThis time it\u2019s different!\u201d\n\n**A Phoenix from the Ashes**\n\nFor detailed past context on this whole process, read this article, it's great  [https://www.ft.com/content/582dd6e7-2ea5-4520-ae4c-d50c00c3799e](https://www.ft.com/content/582dd6e7-2ea5-4520-ae4c-d50c00c3799e)\n\nHere\u2019s a timeline of the bankruptcy exit process. The two key dates are today, the 21st, and the 27th, which are when the victims' votes and the CPUC approval vote will be in, respectively, and when judge will confirm bankruptcy exit plan assuming everything positive. I\u2019ll explain these terms soon, but just know that if both of these pass, PCG will almost certainly exit, resulting in mucho (California term) tendies when judge confirms bankruptcy exit:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mz45y0uynxy41.png?width=257&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbd24b8306a61de087f8d2a2c87f7686fbc7edb8\n\nWhat are the chances of these votes passing? I\u2019ll address the CPUC vote first. The California Public Utilities Commission is basically in charge of regulating utilities like PCG and therefore of approving bankruptcy exit. They are influenced mainly by their commissioner and by the governor. Gov. Slickback (Newsom) has already approved of the current proposal, and will urge the CPUC to approve it. In fact, the previous Gov. was largely ousted in part because of how he handled the PG&E situation. The CPUC commissioner also approves, and CPUC members are doing everything they can to see that this passes, including waiving a $200 million fine against PG&E. They\u2019ve essentially [approved already](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-pcg-8k-pg-e-2020-may-12-18395). Basically, if the people vote yes, CPUC will vote yes too.\n\nAnd the people of California have been voting overwhelmingly in favor of the plan\u2014we\u2019re talking around 97+% of the votes that have been cast are \u201cyes\u201d votes. The plan needs only *2/3rds* of those who bother to vote to vote yes. Further, the votes mentioned below account for a huge portion of those who can *possibly* vote (\\~70k max claimants and far fewer than that will vote). If you aren\u2019t grateful for me wading into 60 pages of legalese to find this, fuck you (and yes, I didn\u2019t just trust the seeking alpha article).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cl9loyn0oxy41.png?width=470&format=png&auto=webp&s=8465086d456c2e93fa6ba22128a8892fa5a526b9\n\nAdditionally, in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QttBK69kb6s), a lawyer representing several thousand more claimants mentions that his clients' votes are overwhelmingly in favor of the plan.\n\nThere\u2019s only one issue in all of this, and it\u2019s not even a real problem. A man named William Abrams is essentially alleging that a small proportion of the votes are invalid for [conflict-of-interest reasons](https://www.kqed.org/news/11817486/pge-bankruptcy-judge-weighs-potential-conflict-of-interest-of-fire-survivors-lawyer); Abrams wants these votes to be thrown out or wants the lawyers involved to initiate a re-vote with more disclosures. The WSJ picked up on this, causing algos to drop the PCG share price earlier this week.\n\nThe motion can be [read here](https://restructuring.primeclerk.com/pge/Home-DownloadPDF?id1=MzYwNDQ5&id2=0) and is, in my opinion, largely BS. This is true on a purely mathematical level. From what I understand, the total debt owned by wall street firms is around $20 million dollars out of a $100 million credit facility. This hardly seems a conflict of interest when the facility is fixed-rate, and the creditors to Mr. Watt\u2019s law firm have no say over him. Further, Watts\u2019 law firm may make up to $1 billion from settlement, which is not considered by the court to be an issue (after all, contingent settlement fees are what align clients and attorneys\u2019 interests, allowing victims to get compensation in the first place)! The $20 million pales in comparison and is a red herring.\n\nAbrams actually has an alternate motivation himself: to get PCG to admit liability for the Tubbs wildfire, which destroyed his home. This is blatantly obvious when you consider the [letter he filed to the court](http://restructuring.primeclerk.com/pge/Home-DownloadPDF?id1=MjE4ODc5&id2=0) in August of last year. Abrams has a *totally understandable* motivation, but his claims are not legally legitimate. Further, he\u2019s positioning himself as an advocate for victims, whereas in reality he\u2019ll be screwing over the only company which could provide them with remuneration, as well as causing payments to be delayed by years and years.\n\nTake a look at the [response](https://restructuring.primeclerk.com/pge/Home-DownloadPDF?id1=MzgyNTYy&id2=0) which was filed to Mr. Abrams\u2019 motion: short, no-BS, and compelling. It doesn\u2019t seem like the big boys think he\u2019s worth worrying about.\n\nAlso worth noting is that the Judge, Dennis Montali, really wants this thing to go through. He\u2019s taken Abrams\u2019 claim \u201cunder advisement,\u201d which essentially is necessary for PR and optics, but is largely ceremonial. If he was keen on delaying the vote he\u2019d have done it at the hearing on the 12th. Since then he's moved forward with confirmation protocol and vote staying same. Consider the advise, dismissed.\n\nLastly, Governor was supportive if the CEO steps down as well as the BoD is replaced\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/pg-e-ceo-to-step-down-after-tumultuous-year-11587564703](https://www.wsj.com/articles/pg-e-ceo-to-step-down-after-tumultuous-year-11587564703)  is stepping down mid-June, his job was to navigate bankruptcy exit, he's done that, time for new CEO\n\nBoD is being replaced except 3 people  [https://www.wsj.com/articles/pg-e-promises-board-shake-up-as-it-pursues-californias-approval-on-bankruptcy-exit-11580535837](https://www.wsj.com/articles/pg-e-promises-board-shake-up-as-it-pursues-californias-approval-on-bankruptcy-exit-11580535837)\n\n**So who else knows this?**\n\nI\u2019ve done enough DD for you already. Go [look](http://holdingschannel.com/bystock/?symbol=pcg) at the involved players betting on an exit: Centerbridge, Elliot, Apollo, etc. [Serengeti Asset Management](https://serengeti-am.com/) is a bankruptcy focused hedge fund that often profits when firms exit bankruptcy, and they have nearly 10% of their portfolio in PG&E. More will pile in once the bankruptcy exit is confirmed, and still more when the company emerges from bankruptcy (many institutional investors have mandates to hold off until such things happen). There's over 80% tute ownership, billions in a company in Ch11 currently. What happens when they exit and have liability protection for future fires and can truck on to a proper PE valuation? Big money inflow is what\n\nFurther, dark pool data shows buying at every slight dip:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uvvz2062oxy41.png?width=1879&format=png&auto=webp&s=155826b7029b6a00e31046a96e8d36a9aa0c0f5e\n\nFor Dark pools, read this article  [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/050614/introduction-dark-pools.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/050614/introduction-dark-pools.asp)\n\nBecause of the aforementioned issues, PGC\u2019s stock price has been depressed. While I\u2019m not going to lie and say that I could accurately value it going forward, I will note that a \\~3x NTM PEG is standard for utilities. If you want to compare metrics further, Edison International is the closest peer at 2.7x. In any case, the process of PCG\u2019s depressed stock price recovering towards a more normal ratio should begin this month, and rapidly accelerate. I\u2019ve seen longer term targets from $15 (UBS just raised their target to this, and they\u2019re definitely still being conservative because of the hearing) to $25+. See below for a lazy comp set, and mess around with the numbers yourself:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dmsdj9t3oxy41.png?width=788&format=png&auto=webp&s=154ca45cd6aa48f03f8ae8d0e1b9398afd1c6540\n\nThere are two bear theories that are uncertain.\n\n1. Fires can happen in summer. If this happens PCG sells off just by fear of fires. My play involves selling before end of june on run up and then just wheeling PCG. Definitely not holding through entire Summer\n2. August 29th according to settlement plan is when PCG must deposit settlement money which is half cash and half issued as new equity. How much dilution will occur is uncertain as it must add up to 6.75B, but the idea is that this is undervalued and will normalize to 20s when exiting bankruptcy and be less dilution than expected. It'll get into a trust that sells shares in 18 months to return victims money.\n\nUltimately, the point is that smart money is betting on this play. Because we\u2019re all single minded degenerates, that might be a turnoff, but it\u2019s a vital piece of the puzzle.\n\nThere are other attractive things about PCG, too, particularly in this environment: it\u2019ll actually be helped by more people staying home, it has no chance of falling in recession as utilities are safe havens (and this is massively undervalued), etc. But I\u2019ve written enough. I\u2019d encourage you to do your own research, and to look into all these interesting points.\n\n**TL;DR for you illiterate fucks.**\n\nPCG [go up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFTLKWw542g).
