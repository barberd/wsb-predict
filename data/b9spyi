{"id": "b9spyi", "title": "The case for $DOW", "selftext": "Dow is a grand old company that makes chemicals - plastics, glass, resins, etc used in wide variety of sectors like  construction, transportation, consumer goods, etc. \n\nDow split off from DWDP. The spin-off created a weird split - if my calculations are correct DOW has more than half the revenue/EBITDA of pre-split DWDP but less than half the EV. Dow enterprise value now is 57B (42 equity + 20 debt - 5 cash) and has 9B of EBITDA - resulting in 6.3x multiple. Most peers trade at 10x. \n\nMight be a good one-month trade while the market figures out the prices. Own May 17 $60 calls.
