{"id": "g1nvvm", "title": "\"Markets are looking forward\" is bullshit.", "selftext": "This phrase pisses me off more than JPowell right now. The notion that this retracing and recovery is based off investors seeing hope and a brighter future is so hypocritical. Are you seriously going to tell me that in early March before any stay-home order, double digit US death count, non-china border closure the market was eyeing Q1 revenue reports and saying \"oh shit it's fucked dump now.\" Over a month before earning release??? Price in my ass!\n\n\nI don't buy it, because if you apply the same forward thinking logic to April 15th, this shit is so fucking grim we should be gapping down each morning and circuit breaking by noon. Any economy reopening before antibody research shows promise, testing kits are as common as cell phones, or a vaccine is weeks from FDA approval is irrational. \n\nExactly what is looking so good about our Q2-Q3 future that has us still greener than my fucking toe fungus!? I'm a realist,  which is obviously retarded right now because all I see in the future is wave 2 and a daily trump rant about how is immune to mistakes.", "created_utc": 1586938824.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1nvvm/markets_are_looking_forward_is_bullshit/", "is_self": true}
