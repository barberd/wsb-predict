Preferably on a company with a cheap underlying...and a business that even wsb can comprehend?\n\n$TACO (Del Taco) reports earnings on Monday AMC, here is why it\u2019s going up and how to play it:\n\n1) QSRs (quick service restaurants) will benefit disproportionally from pandemic per several studies\n\n2) 99% of del taco restaurants have drive thrus, per 10-K\n\n3) MEANINGFUL insider buying before and after pandemic, and mgmt team increasingly focused on execution. mgmt team is aligned with shareholders and has said theyre willing to sell company if opportunity presents itself. (I\u2019m not banking on this short term but it\u2019s cheap and attractive business (ill get to this in moment)). also mgmt team came out last week and said theyre all taking 20% pay cuts. they\u2019d rather the stock go up.\n\n4) CHEAP STOCK. $189M market cap was valued by PE at $500M a few years ago. p/b of 0.65, forward p/e 14, little l/t debt, strong fcf \n\n5) strong customer base that loves the food. go on twitter and reddit and search del taco. look at google trends and search glassdoor reviews. loyal customers and well run business\n\n6) increased and timely marketing that will finally present itself in q1. They introduced the app and have been pumping coupons since start of 2020. and it will drive sales. Also go on youtube and look up del taco on SNL; the skit with Adam Driver is actually fucking funny and it was the first SNL skit of 2020. effective marketing is effective. AW MAN IM ALL OUT OF CASH\n\n7) they have already pulled guidance which dropped stock, should fall even if bad er\n\n8) other random thoughts: stock doesnt screen well (go on finviz youll see comps missing). everyone loves tacos, there arent many fast food mexican restaurants in USA, there\u2019s really just taco bell and i suppose cmg. also the demographic market of the chain (southwest and west coast) increases effectiveness of branding and helps the growth argument throughout country. also the mgt team has been closing restaurants that arent profitable since last year, this will help bottom line and tailwind going forward \n\nTLDR: everybody loves cheap tacos, tendies will rain on cinco de mayo. $TACO calls\n\n$TACO 7.5c 6/19\n$TACO 10c 9/18\n$TACO shares for the r/investing lurkers\n\nEDIT: Grammar\nEDIT 2: ER is Monday AMC", "created_utc": 1588436129.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gc92qt/calls_on_taco_for_cinco_de_mayo_tendies/", "is_self": true}
