What do you think will become of it?", "selftext": "So for those of you who don\u2019t know what I\u2019m tackling about, ALXN(Alexion pharmaceuticals) has a successful drug for a rare disease called PNH, for which it charges a shit ton because the disease is rare. It\u2019s the only option for people with the condition so they can charge whatever they want. APLS (Apellis pharmaceuticals) has a drug called APL-2. It has shown promise in phase 2 clinical trials. It is a drug for the same rare condition. Phase 3 clinical trials of APL-2 will compare the drug to Soliris. If it does well, then ALXN stock will lose a ton of value and APLS will go to the moon. I think that however this trial ends up, the result will be bad for ALXN. I think that APL-2 will be approved regardless because of its success in phase 2 trials and ALXN\u2019s constant violations of FDA rules for the manufacturing of soliris. This is just my idea, anyone else have a perspective on this?", "created_utc": 1570206767, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dd9rcq/what_are_your_opinions_on_the_apls_alxn_feud_what/", "is_self": true}
