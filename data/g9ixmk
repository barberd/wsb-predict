There will be no upfront out-of-pocket costs to people who receive an order for a test through a doctor or healthcare provider, including telemedicine providers.\n\nAntibody blood tests offered by LabCorp are administered across the U.S. at tens of thousands of doctors\u2019 offices and at LabCorp\u2019s nearly 2,000 patient service centers, including LabCorp at Walgreens locations. Results will be available to the ordering healthcare provider within 1-3 days after the date of specimen pick up. They are also available to patients in the LabCorp Patient\u2122 mobile app.\n\nAdam Schechter, president and CEO of LabCorp, said: \u201cWe are bringing the full force of LabCorp\u2019s science and testing capabilities to serve individuals across the U.S. whether they had the virus or believe they have the virus. We stand with all Americans, healthcare workers, and those on the frontlines who are helping people in need.\u201d\n\nRichard Ashworth, president of Walgreens, said: \u201cCOVID-19 response requires collaboration across industries and sectors, and we\u2019re pleased to further our relationship with LabCorp in order to improve access to COVID-19 and antibody testing in many of the communities we serve. By continuing to expand our testing efforts and resources, together we\u2019ll play a critical role in helping to keep our communities healthy and enabling more Americans to return to work once they can do so safely.\u201d\n\nLabCorp began antibody blood testing on a limited basis to high-priority healthcare workers in late-March and currently has capacity to perform over 50,000 antibody tests per day. By mid-May, LabCorp expects to be able to perform 200,000 tests per day as more tests and testing platforms receive U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).\n\nThe COVID-19 antibody blood tests detect the presence of antibodies to the virus and can help identify individuals who have been exposed to the virus. While antibody tests are helpful to understand if an individual has developed antibodies and a potential immune response, antibody testing should not be used as the sole basis to diagnose or exclude infection. Knowing a patient\u2019s results might be useful in the determination of important decisions, such as the ability for hospital staff to care for patients.\n\nThese tests have not been reviewed by the FDA but are being offered by LabCorp in accordance with the public health emergency guidance issued by the FDA on March 16.\n\nLabCorp is committed to providing critical information regarding COVID-19. Updates related to LabCorp\u2019s response are available on LabCorp\u2019s COVID-19 microsite.\n\nMore information about LabCorp at Walgreens can be found at http://www.LabCorp.com/Walgreens.", "created_utc": 1588060076.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9ixmk/labcorp_announces_coronavirus_covid19_antibody/", "is_self": true}
