The tires kick up money behind them. \n\nIn 1 school bus there\u2019s bears. The bears placement could be anything. Hanging out widows holding jousting polls. Or on top with machine guns. \n\nIn bus 2 there are bulls doing similar things. \n\nIn the middle WSB guy is putting his arms out in order to prevent a crash. \n\nIt\u2019s pretty symbolic actually. \n\nThat\u2019s all. I\u2019m thinking use a lighter color pallet idgaf tho you\u2019re the one carrying out my idea. \n\nThanks so much you guys are fucking awesome", "created_utc": 1590221346.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gp19bu/wsb_artists_needed_for_a_flag_design/", "is_self": true}
