Looking through the forums it seems that it's overrun by kids not having a clue about what they're doing.... prove me wrong please.\n\nI'm looking at a possible short term speculative bear play on Paypal. The price is extended past daily stochastic and the weekly charts is displaying a bearish pinbar. On top of that, Paypal for me is overextended in price and due for a pull back to the moving averages.\n\nMy only contradiction is that the SPX is on a strong bull -run at the moment so I'll be counter-trend trading. Initially i think I'll wait until tomorrow for another bearish candle before I commit to a trade. I'm thinking of doing a bear-put spread option on it, or maybe some synthetic option combo with a cap on loss, expiring around 17th July.\n\nI'd like to know your thoughts on my opinions.\n\nI'm also always eager to learn especially in regards to options trading so please send any decent resources.\n\n**EDIT: A small short down to the 20 EMA where it has bounced off previously. ($146)**\n\n**EDIT: see attached screenshot for my thinking:**\n\n[https://i.ibb.co/Dbxh6Hx/20ema.png](https://i.ibb.co/Dbxh6Hx/20ema.png)\n\nEDIT - is there another sub reddit for options trading?", "created_utc": 1591308817.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gwrjae/possible_short_on_paypal_pypl/", "is_self": true}
