I feel like this IPO will be succesful and like 13 months down the road Pinterest gets busted for lying about all their shit. Nobody uses pinterest anymore, I used to see pinterest links being shared on Facebook all the time. They say they Have 125 Million users in the USA. Theres only 230 Million Adults over 18 in the USA. Who is their demographic? I cant remember the last time I saw someone share a pinterest Link. Its like Myspace that shit is well on its way out. \n\n\nHere is the google Trends interest over time on Pinterest. \nhttp://magaimg.net/img/7rvx.png\n\nThis is another shithole \"tech\" company thats really just a website, that is doing another cash grab IPO.", "created_utc": 1555600025, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bemmox/pinterest_ipo_another_shithole_tech_company_dd/", "is_self": true}
