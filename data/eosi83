{"id": "eosi83", "title": "Question Regarding SPY Puts", "selftext": "I hold SPY Dec 17 275p. My trade thesis is that there will be a downturn at SOME point in the next 3 months. Although an ongoing uptrend until then would make me lose value to Delta, it would also keep the Vega value of the options fairly low.\n\nWhen the correction DOES come, I would gain money from Delta AND Vega, as spot price would grow closer to my strike, and IV would go up as well.\n\nIn the meantime, this far out from expiry, Theta effects are mitigated.\n\nSUMMARY: If SPY goes up, I lose money to Delta, but if it goes down I gain from Delta **and** Vega. In the meantime, Theta losses are fairly gentle.\n\nIs this a fair understanding of how The Greeks might affect my position value this far away from expiry? I'm still fairly new to this.", "created_utc": 1579040064, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eosi83/question_regarding_spy_puts/", "is_self": true}
