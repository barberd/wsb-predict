Bay Area is on total quarantine until early April (recent news), and none of their employees are going to be able to show up. Engineers might be able to work from home but production employees can\u2019t do shit. No production employees = no production (I did the math). Btw, Fremont is where they make the cars.\n\nIf Tesla Fremont closes (pending announcement in next couple days), the other Gigafactories will have little to no production. They can\u2019t produce car stuff (motors, inverters, battery packs, etc) if there aren\u2019t any cars to put them in (I did the math). They\u2019ll still stay open to produce energy products, but no one cares about that.\n\nQ1 is gonna to be terrible.", "created_utc": 1584412428.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjxiof/boomer_virus_actually_has_a_huge_impact_on_tslas/", "is_self": true}
