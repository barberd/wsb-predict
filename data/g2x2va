{"id": "g2x2va", "title": "A reason you lost money on puts that isn't JPow", "selftext": ">50% of market volume is either high frequency traders or systematic quantitative trading. What these strategies have in common is that they do not react to news, as a rule. Yeah they want you to believe that they've coded together some ass-kicker NLP news dissection algorithm that trades news faster than anyone else can, but the reality is that any systematic strategy based on this has been closed down because it's generally impossible to backtest correctly and the sharpe ratio just isn't that great. Thus, I guarantee if you ask anyone in the business, the quant firms who are responsible for the majority of trading volume are basically acting as if nothing is happening, like we're still in January, no Wuhan virus has ever come about. There's no conspiracy here, it's just that these firms move too slowly to be able to make an adjustment like that. This isn't necessarily a good thing for them, and it's likely that they will lose a ton of money. But that's at least one reason why the market is behaving \"like nothing has happened\".", "created_utc": 1587107673.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2x2va/a_reason_you_lost_money_on_puts_that_isnt_jpow/", "is_self": true}
