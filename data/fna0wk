{"id": "fna0wk", "title": "Originally Authored WSB Letter to Airlines (Not Copied from Business Insider)", "selftext": "Dear Airlines,\n\nLike you, I was upset to see and hear about what happened over the last month across the United States.  \n\nWhile the facts and circumstances are still evolving, especially with respect to why airlines defied CDC Recommendations the way they did, to give you a clearer picture of what transpired, I\u2019ve included below a recap from the preliminary reports filed by our employees.\n\nAs you will read, this situation was unfortunately compounded when several of the airlines we had politely asked to not use buybacks over the years refused and it became necessary to contact Congress to help.  Our employees followed established procedures for dealing with situations like this. While I deeply regret this situation arose, I also emphatically stand behind all of you, and I want to commend you for continuing to go above and beyond to ensure we fly right.\n\nI do, however, believe there are lessons we can learn from this experience, and we are taking a close look at the circumstances surrounding this incident. Treating the American people with respect and dignity should be at the core of who we are, and we must always remember this no matter how challenging the situation.\n\nOscar", "created_utc": 1584921380.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fna0wk/originally_authored_wsb_letter_to_airlines_not/", "is_self": true}
