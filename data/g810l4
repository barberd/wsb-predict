Literally cannot go tits up.", "selftext": "So Friday, my shitty bank reversed my paycheck and my manager told me I may have to wait for up to a week to receive it. \n\nI instantly shit myself because I have my credit card bill, car insurance and a car payment that is due and currently all my money is in DHT 9c 5/15. \n\nI called American express and before I even finished my story they told me that they will push my credit card bill back 2 months. They didn\u2019t ask me to verify my bank, they didn\u2019t ask me about my employer, fucking nothing. They just pushed back my bill.\n\nIf it was that easy for me, imagine the millions of their other customers who are unemployed, haven\u2019t gotten unemployment benefits, and haven\u2019t gotten their stimulus check\n\nThey are legit not making any fucking money right now. \n\nLiterally cannot go tits up. \n\nAXP 55p 5/22", "created_utc": 1587847605.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g810l4/allin_shorting_axp_after_one_phone_call_literally/", "is_self": true}
