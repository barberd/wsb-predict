When I got $25,100 dollars on my account, I began to day trade. \nLittle did I know, your have to maintain a balance overnight of 25k, before that PDT restriction is lifted. \nI got called for $3500 in margin activity this morning, for all the day trading that I used yesterday. Now I have to give everyone I know a rimjob and BJ, for the extra funds, just so my account isn\u2019t locked on 2/18 until 5/18. \nDon\u2019t be an idiot like me.", "created_utc": 1581434229, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f29phj/psa_part_rime_day_trading/", "is_self": true}
