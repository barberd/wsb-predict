{"id": "gn9gnq", "title": "\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b Predicting 18% Market Drop", "selftext": "I\u2019m predicting at least an 18% market drop from current S&P levels, even with Fed intervention, which cannot be sustained for the full duration of COVID-19. IMO the market has not priced in prolonged consumer behavior shift, global outbreaks suppressing GPD, and an American resurgence. My estimate is we see a very strong drop triggered by (a) another resurgence, AND (b) worse than expected economic data OR (b) commercial real estate collapse.. Please change my mind:\n \nVirus: Despite COVID-19 news, a vaccine will not likely be ready for at least 8 \u2013 12 mo., without a vaccine, we risk an immediate resurgence, as this is already happening in China. Moreover, the virus is evolving by taking longer to show symptoms with prolonged effects.\n \nExport Market: Something not a lot of people are discussing is the US Export market. This is already back to 2015 lows and 2012 highs. Seeing the dependency on crushed Asian export markets, not considering China trade wars, it\u2019s unlikely to rebound anytime soon.\n \nSmall Business: Small business accounted for 45% of GDP in 2010. Statistics currently show 40% of small business could fail. If this happens, US GDP would fall from its 21,200 B level to ~ 15,476 B, its 2014 level, when SPY was 180 levels.\n \nCommercial Real Estate: With 40% of small business failure potential, commercial real estate leases would be unpaid, leaving to massive delinquency by landlords and creating instability in the commercial real estate market.  \n \nUnemployment Trailing Indicator: If you look at the 2008 unemployment drop, as well as other recessions, the effects were gradual, so we crept into a recession and out of it, whereas the drop here is immediate and far greater than 2008. What is particularly concerning is most of those effected are low income, meaning they have little savings and are likely to have debt.  \n \nConsumer Behavior: Even if the virus is controlled, consumer behavior will do one of two things. Millennials 38% of workforce and Gen Z, who nobody really cares about, will go out like nothing\u2019s wrong while Boomers and Gen X (majority of consumers) will not. The economy cannot be supported by Millennials alone, in-fact, the only thing their going out will do is further spread the virus to fuel another resurgence.", "created_utc": 1589973129.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gn9gnq/predicting_18_market_drop/", "is_self": true}
