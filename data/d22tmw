No matter how much you think you're saving on free options commissions, it doesn't even come close to Tasty or ToS's order execution &amp; ultimate money saving services. Why does order execution matter? Are you tired of RH \"0.01\" morning glitches? Have you ever tried selling or buying multi-legged options (ie. iron condors, strangles, straddles, credit spreads, and other strats that actually make u money) on RH only to be last in line and cucked by others in ToS and Tasty getting filled immediately before you? If so, then simply don't options on RH... Very simple.\n\nTL;DR: Robinhood is for poors, and ToS &amp; Tastyworks is not for poors", "created_utc": 1568090804, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d22tmw/sir_this_is_a_wendys_rant_on_why_rh_sucks/", "is_self": true}
