This community actually changed my life. Here's my percentage profit since I opened my IB account in January. I can post other screenshots for proof if anyone cares.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l8kmawa0tuu41.png?width=1086&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a8d49dd72a8c7a09448324d66cc34e18c2f80a4\n\nI don\u2019t know if anyone cares about posts like these, but I thought I\u2019d share my progress since January when I discovered options (and WSB). Until that point, my portfolio was about 50/50 between VTI and individual stocks. My first experience with WSB was to board the TSLA train in mid-January on its way up. I only bought shares, but I still made about $3000 out of it, which was amazing for someone still in the index fund mindset.\n\nIn early February I jumped on SPCE and tried out options for the first time. I missed out on selling at the high but I came away with $10k profit. I also tried out some MSFT options, including the infamous 3/20 $200c. Luckily I just about broke even on the MSFT calls. Then, in the end of February rug pull, I made a panic decision to liquidate everything. My portfolio went down by $4000 on 2/24, and I just felt that worse was coming.\n\nI ended up riding the wave down with a mixed bag of puts, and it took me a while to settle on SPY and some of the EW ETFs. I had a few potential 10-bagger positions along the way, but I was always taking profits in the 100-400% range so I never got to that level.\n\nMy nearly-all-in play was Friday 13 March, when the president introduced his CEO parade and the market surged during the last hour. I bought SPY puts (and a bit of INDA) with May expiries, and I averaged down on my cost basis during the hour. By EOD I had $78k in (of $110k total), but I was down $14k on paper from the megapump.\n\nOf course, I had no idea that SA and Russia were going to crash the price of oil over that weekend, and by the end of Monday I closed my positions for a $55k profit. I regret not holding INDA for another few days, because I missed out on another $10-15k. But I\u2019ve since learned to be happy with what I do have, and to know that I\u2019ve been incredibly lucky.\n\nSince then I\u2019ve been sitting on 100% cash most of the time. I didn\u2019t catch the wave back up because I just had no idea what was going on. I\u2019m now waiting for the next leg down, assuming it comes. I have a shopping list of stocks I want for the long term, and for the most I think I\u2019ll go back to being a boring investor, while keeping a bit on the side for options. The bonus is that for next few years my profits are tax-free thanks to my living arrangements.\n\nPositions:\n\n12 SNAP 5/15 $15p (bought Wednesday morning, down 48%, I\u2019ll let it ride for a few more days)\n\n2 SPY 7/17 $250p (bought AH today)\n\nI tried to buy 2 SPY 5/1 $285c AH as well for insurance purposes, but my order didn\u2019t get filled. My fingers are crossed for a flat/red Monday open.\n\nI also wrote two BA puts today for $120 and $115, expiring 5/1. If I don't get assigned, free money, and if I do, then I\u2019ll use the shares to start selling weekly or monthly covered calls. If the price tanks after that, then I\u2019m okay with holding those bags for a while.", "created_utc": 1587772912.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7jm8g/thank_you_wsb_95k_in_2_months/", "is_self": true}
