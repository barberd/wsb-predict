{"id": "gqhpi8", "title": "Weekly Theta Gang Thread", "selftext": "I can\u2019t believe much hate I got for playing DAL and predicting a bounce based off of technical analysis. Well it is a good thing I remembered how stupid this sub is and played it again because it bounced exactly like I predicted and by how much I predicted. I even re-read the same comment by u/astrophysics23 three times because it was amazing how completely and utterly wrong he was in everything he said. He also pledge to keep buying the DAL puts I\u2019d write but is too chicken shit to post screenshots.\n\nRant over. This week I\u2019m mostly going to be writing puts on spx because I think investor confidence has come back and the more we test the ~297 resistance the more green we will see when it breaks up. Let me know what options you plan to write this week. \n\nProof of 4.7k profit: https://i.imgur.com/yG2wqQA.png https://i.imgur.com/TF2spOQ.png https://i.imgur.com/Sydgi7y.png https://i.imgur.com/JsGBHjc.png", "created_utc": 1590435511.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gqhpi8/weekly_theta_gang_thread/", "is_self": true}
