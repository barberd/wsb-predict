I don\u2019t know how to trade options, but I can\u2019t get enough of Mr Powell\u2019s lubeless green dildos. I\u2019ve been dollar cost averaging into the \ud83c\udf08est \ud83d\udc28 ETF I can find throughout this entire March/April rally (BBUS: *BetaShares U.S. Equities Strong Bear Hedge Fund - Currency Hedged*) What do you guys think of this ETF? It has huge fees for an ETF (1.38% pa) and Deutsche Bank is the EFT custodian. So far I\u2019ve managed to turn $93K into $68K ($54k in BBUS holdings and $14K cash on the side). What would you do if you were in my position? I\u2019m worried that even if all my \ud83c\udf08 \ud83d\udc3b dreams come true, there might be some Deutsche Bank counter-party risk that I don\u2019t understand.
