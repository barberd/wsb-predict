{"id": "hb2bg9", "title": "TSLA is overvalued", "selftext": "Just look at their income statement and balance sheet, they got 6B in equity and operate at a loss, the loss is tiny compared to all the cash they have and it's not that important because they are in a growth phase where they're expanding and doing r/D so i don't care about the losses, pls their book value is 6B, market cap is 191B,\n\nThey make approx 20% profit margin before interest and taxes and also operating costs, with operating costs they're at a loss of 100M which is peanuts.\n\nBut if they don't reduce cost of goods sold they still won't have profits even without debt.\n\nFor the price to be reasonable they should have a P/E ratio of like 20, that means 9.6B of net earnings, to achieve that they should increase their earnings alot (thing that i deem possible in the next years, i think Tesla is the future of cars) and reduce their costs of operations and production.\n\nAt the moment the price includes realistic future growth in it so i think it doesen't make sense to buy it at that price.\n\nThe company is in a mediocre financial situation having 6B in cash but also 10B in long term debt and 1.5B in account payables(already subtracted receivables).\n\nEdit: if you consider that on the next 20 years they will make 10B profit a year, starting from 2020, at a 10% discount rate that I pulled out my ass, they would be worth 186B.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think?", "created_utc": 1592434915.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hb2bg9/tsla_is_overvalued/", "is_self": true}
