{"id": "hdvvim", "title": "I'm still a little bullish on NKLA", "selftext": "So I should start off with some caveat. I'm holding a whole mess of warrants.\n\nNow, that said, I'm still a little bullish on NKLA, at least enough to hold onto those and exercise or sell after July 3rd.\n\nWhat's my opinion of the companies value? It doesn't matter, and sometimes that's what I need to remember. \n\nWe could argue about the fact they haven't produced anything, including convincing evidence of their claims. Nothing sold, nothing to show what true edge they'll even hold in a claimed market space. \n\nRetail investors already showed they're in for enough tendies to push it where it is. And for all of you saying the institutional investors are just going to cash out, I feel like you're applying your own logic to the institutional investors. When many of them invested, I'm sure they have a span of time in mind to hold the investment.\n\nBut the absolute biggest thing to make me question the seemingly overwhelming opinion here that it's going to tank in early July is the utter cockiness of that viewpoint. Every time I see WSB take a heavy lean towards a \"sure thing\" it typically inverses or surprises everyone with some THETA straight lines.\n\nI doubt it moons to 100, but with the level of arrogance of the whole board saying it tanks early July... I feel just fine about holding my warrants to get closer to the share price before exiting my position. \n\nThank you retards for making me feel better about something I was otherwise a little worried about. Godspeed, and for the ones who bought puts at the current premium, you're the true retards of this situation.", "created_utc": 1592844431.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hdvvim/im_still_a_little_bullish_on_nkla/", "is_self": true}
