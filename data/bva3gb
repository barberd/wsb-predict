{"id": "bva3gb", "title": "Beyond Meat (BYND) - My Due Diligence", "selftext": "Here\u2019s my DD for BYND over the next several months.\n\nShort term (1-4 months) - very bullish\nMid to long term (6 months +) - very bearish\n\nHere\u2019s the thing. Before their IPO I didn\u2019t even know what Beyond Meat even was. I\u2019m a big meat guy (dislike anything related to veganism), but even for myself I\u2019m tempted to give their \u201cmeat\u201d a go.\n\nThere are many people out there, just like myself, who didn\u2019t know this company even existed, but are curious to give it a try. This is possibly why many stores have sold out of all their product.\n\nRight now the stock is trading off hype and I\u2019m guessing the people \u201ctrying\u201d their product will boost sales/revenues for this quarter and next. \n\nEssentially the IPO was free marketing. When the hype is gone the organic growth will slow down and the stock will sink.\n\nDisclaimer: I don\u2019t hold any positions and this is not investment advice.", "created_utc": 1559322126, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bva3gb/beyond_meat_bynd_my_due_diligence/", "is_self": true}
