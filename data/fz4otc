{"id": "fz4otc", "title": "Thinking of betting against real estate in this market? Dream on.", "selftext": "> [Dream](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/drm?countrycode=ca) is a leading developer of exceptional office and residential assets in Toronto, owns stabilized income generating assets in both Canada and the U.S., and has an established and successful asset management business, inclusive of $9 billion of assets under management across three TSX listed trusts and numerous partnerships. We also develop land and residential assets in Western Canada for immediate sale. Dream expects to generate more recurring income in the future as its urban development properties are completed and held for the long term. Dream has a proven track record for being innovative and for our ability to source, structure and execute on compelling investment opportunities.\n\n\n\n**PRIMER**\n\n\nFor the following piece, I am going to use the information found in the following materials as a primer. They are a good read if you have the time or desire.\n\n-Dream's [Annual Report](http://www.dream.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Dream-2019-Annual-Report_final.pdf)\n\n-[2019 Management Information Circular.](http://www.dream.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Dream-Unlimited-2019-MIC-v14-FINALSecured.pdf) We have to use the 2019 one, as the 2020 one has not yet been issued.\n\n-Toronto has a housing bubble problem [1](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/canada-property-bubble-1.5394421) [2](https://www.ubs.com/global/en/wealth-management/chief-investment-office/life-goals/real-estate/2019/global-real-estate-bubble-index-2019.html) [3](https://betterdwelling.com/ubs-global-real-estate-correction-phase-emerging-toronto-climbs-bubble-list/)\n\n-Beer flu is causing major problems for real estate [so far](https://business.financialpost.com/executive/posthaste-the-coronavirus-crisis-has-cut-toronto-housing-sales-in-half-in-just-two-weeks)\n\n-Torontonians have a big [debt problem](https://www.thestar.com/business/2019/08/21/torontonians-taking-on-debt-at-fastest-rate-in-canada.html)\n\n-A \"perfect storm could be brewing\" due to the pandemic, household debt, and housing prices [1](https://www.macleans.ca/economy/economicanalysis/coronavirus-plunges-canadas-economy-into-the-abyss/) [2](https://www.macleans.ca/economy/economicanalysis/do-we-really-expect-canadian-households-to-bail-out-the-economy-again/)\n\nThese general themes are my premise for the analysis of the company.\n\nI will reference some page numbers throughout this piece as a reference. Please note that these are the page numbers of the actual PDF, and not the page numbers located at the bottom of the corresponding document. \n\n\n\n**WHO THE F*CK ARE YOU?!**\n\n\nI am a retard who lives in Toronto and does some trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. That's all you have to know. Welcome to my Ted Talk. I will do you all a favor and get the boring (but still important) financial shit pertaining to this company out of the way first.\n\n\n\n**LET'S TALK MONEY**\n\n\n76.7% of their revenue came from Asset Management for 3 months ending Dec \u201919, 59.6% for year of 2019 (per pages 44-45 of the Annual Report). This was their bread and butter for 2019, which was a big difference from 2018 where it was their development in Western Canada.\n\n> Fees related to development activities and partnerships included within this segment can fluctuate depending on the number of active projects and on Dream meeting certain milestones as the development manager. We expect that development and other management fees will continue to increase in future years as our existing developments progress through construction milestones.\n\nSome of fees they get for their asset management are on pages 14-15 of the [Annual Information Form.](https://www.docdroid.net/Nvvyfeo/aif-pdf#page=14) Basically, if some of the factors in my premise come to fruition, then they will likely be looking at a pretty big hit at their fee-generating revenue.\n\nPage 52 of the Annual Report gets into what they call the stabilized income generating assets. Arapahoe Basin in Colorado is the main asset they list there for 2019. Arapahoe Basin has been closed for [almost a month due](https://www.arapahoebasin.com/covid-19-updates/) to beer flu.\n\nThis won\u2019t necessarily crush them, but they have 100% ownership of this one, so that will definitely hurt, especially when you consider it represented a good chunk of their stabilized income generating revenue sources for 2019. Furthermore, we don't know when it will re-open.\n\nThey sold their stake in the [Dream Global REIT,](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/12/10/1958737/0/en/Dream-Global-Real-Estate-Investment-Trust-Announces-Closing-of-Blackstone-Acquisition.html) which undoubtedly inflated earnings further, as that was a massive one-time transaction (per page 50 of the Annual Report).\n\nThey also have a boatload of condo inventory relative to their housing inventory (per page 99 of the Annual Report). This is particularly interesting when you consider how [ridiculously inflated](https://www.narcity.com/real-estate/ca/on/toronto/toronto-condo-prices-are-more-expensive-than-the-average-canadian-home) condo prices have gotten in Toronto.\n\nSure, people have been gobbling that shit up for years now, but perhaps it is possible that the perfect storm in my premise will be the catalyst that wakes people up. For those who are familiar with housing economics and spatial models, I personally think as millenials and Gen Z start having their balls finally drop, urban sprawl will happen more as they opt for cheaper, larger, detached housing in the suburbs, but that is based a lot off anecdotal evidence and would be more of a long-term thing to consider.\n\n\n\n**PUMP IT**\n\n\nYou may notice that Dream's stock has done well over the past year, even factoring in the selloff that happened in mid-March. However, there is more than meets the eye. They had some massive share [buybacks](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/02/25/1990332/0/en/Dream-Unlimited-Corp-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-Results-Significant-Growth-in-EPS-and-Book-Equity.html) over the past year.\n\n> In the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, 0.3 million and 2.0 million Subordinate Voting Shares were purchased for cancellation by the Company for $2.5 million and $16.5 million, respectively, under its NCIB representing **12% of annual trade volume.**\n\nThis is also detailed a bit on pages 58-59 on the Annual Report.\n\nThis was already a low float, low daily volume stock, but there are now just 92.2 million shares outstanding, and having 12% of your 2019 trading volume be in the form of buybacks is massive. Some may try to position activity like this as management simply being confident in the company's future, but I think there may be something else at play here.\n\nThis is clearly something that contributed to pumping the share price. This makes them and their company look nice and valuable, of course, but it also lines their own pockets too. Pages 50-76 of the Management Information Circular get into this in more detail, but since many will not want to read it, let [this](https://i.imgur.com/yErZOv5.jpg) give you an idea of what it means.\n\nThe pumping of the share price would allow them to receive higher cash bonuses for performance (based on year-over-year change in total equity per share), and would also help the performance share unit plan and share option plan yield a lot more money for them as well. There is one person who it obviously benefits the most based on the table I posted, and per page 59 of the Annual Report:\n\n> The President and CRO owned an approximate 40% economic interest and 85% voting interest in the Company as at February 21, 2020.\n\n\n\n**STAKES IN REITs**\n\n\n> As of February 21, 2020, we held $743 million units at fair value in Dream Office REIT (D.UN) and [Dream Alternatives](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/10/17/1930910/0/en/Dream-Asset-Management-Corporation-Increases-Interest-In-Dream-Hard-Asset-Alternatives-Trust.html) (DRA.UN), which accounts for over 60% of our current market cap before considering our extensive land holdings in downtown Toronto which are carried at cost on our balance sheet or the value of our remaining asset management contracts.\n\nThat note in the Annual Report was a big oof for them, as the prices of the two REITs ([D.UN](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/d.ut?countrycode=ca) and [DRA.UN](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/dra.ut?countrycode=ca)) have come off quite a bit since then, as well as their own share price. You will notice that the Dream (DRM) share price has fared a bit better. Dream's market cap back then was around $1.286 billion, whereas it sits at about $968 million now. The difference between then and now in their equity positions in the two REITs is about -$218 million. You should also be aware that this includes the (unrealized) profit that they made on buying more shares of D.UN in [late March.](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/24/2005159/0/en/DREAM-UNLIMITED-CORP-ACQUIRES-UNITS-OF-DREAM-OFFICE-REAL-ESTATE-INVESTMENT-TRUST.html)\n\nClearly, the market has \"pRiCeD iN\" the loss of value directly from the equity loss, but how much of anything else has it \"pRiCeD iN?\" I am not even seeing the reduction in asset management fees due to the declines of the REITs in the current price. The 52-week low is below $7. We closed at $9.48 on Thursday.\n\n\n\n**CFO RESIGNS**\n\n\nThis part is purely speculation, as I do not have any additional information than anyone else here would have, but it is something that piqued my interest nonetheless.\n\nThe [resignation of the CFO](http://www.dream.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Dream-CFO-Resignation-News-Release-v3-FINAL.pdf) of the company rather abruptly to \"pursue another opportunity\" is also something I found interesting. This is especially interesting when you consider she is leaving an opportunity that compensates her pretty handsomely, yet Google searches can't even reveal what this other opportunity is.\n\nAnother interesting tidbit is some of her [recent transaction history of shares](https://docdro.id/G5eNzie) right before and shortly after the resignation was announced. I will leave it for you to interpret what that might mean.\n\n\n\n**RISKY BUSINESS**\n\n\nIf you have made it this far, you can surely afford to read a bit more. Page 60 of the Annual Report goes over some \"Risk Factors.\" Give that a quick read. If you accept the premise, I would say that factors such as Development Risk, Delays, Real Estate Ownership, Rollover of Leases, Market Conditions, Residential Rental Business Risk, and Asset Management Risks could be pretty fuckin' big problems.\n\n\n\n**AT A GLANCE**\n\n\nNow this is definitely a weaker point (hence why I just threw it in at the end).\n\nCheck out what [office space](https://leasing.dream.ca/) they have for lease right now in Canada. Based on what I could see, clicking the button to show fully leased properties does not increase the total number by as much as you\u2019d think. Based on that, it seems only about 56% of their properties appear to be fully leased. \n\nIn addition, page 49 of the Annual Report shows that there are a shit-ton of projects that are still in the stage of planning or construction. If beer flu just turns out to be a short-term blip, then that is one thing. However, if after reading the premise you consider the potential ripple effect this may have, if it does throw a wrench in the Toronto housing market, you have to wonder what becomes of these projects, and how much is pRiCeD iN.\n\nTake this information for what it\u2019s worth. I don't put a ton of value into it, but I found it useful at a quick glance.\n\n\n\n**ROUND UP**\n\n\nAlright, since I know there is probably not a single person who actually read all this shit, time to give you the retard version.\n\n**TL;DR - Housing bubble in Toronto + massive debts of Torontonians + unemployment/uncertainty caused by beer flu = recipe for disaster for Toronto housing. This company has too much skin in the game in Toronto, I don't think there is as much pRiCeD iN at these levels as there should be, and I find some of the shit I outlined in the write-up regarding the buybacks, the executive compensation, and the CFO's resignation eyebrow-raising.**\n\nDo whatever you want with this information I have provided. I am not liable for your stupidity. I don't fuckin' know.\n\nThank you for listening to my Ted Talk.", "created_utc": 1586609847.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fz4otc/thinking_of_betting_against_real_estate_in_this/", "is_self": true}
