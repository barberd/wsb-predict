They will host an analyst call to discuss the financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2020, at 6pm EDT Wednesday, May 27. \n\nEarly March, MESO announces its plan to start testing its allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell drug remestemcel-L in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by COVID-19 in the United States, Australia, China and Europe. \n\n In the first smaller study, 12 patients were dosed with Remestemcel-L . Within the first 5 days, ten patients (83%) survived, and nine patients (75%) were removed off ventilator support after a median of ten days.  To put these results into perspective, a study of ventilator dependent covid 19 patients in a NY hospital had a mortality rate of 88%.  \n\nThey started to dose the first patients in the phase 2/3 trial of their stem cell therapy, Remestemcel-L, on May 5th.  Results from their previous trial produced positive results rather quickly.  \n\nGood news imminent?\n\nMESO 6/19 17.5", "created_utc": 1590520109.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gr3ds1/oh_meso_horny/", "is_self": true}
