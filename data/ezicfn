They literally take shareholder money, light it on fire, and then harass female employees and pay them with shareholder money.  This company (which, i'm told, has an iphone app) is valued at 62 BILLION dollars.  The entire company is literally an iphone app.  \"Oh, but its a special iphone app, u/Slaggon3\".  No it fucking isn't, and just to prove that it wasn't some other shit company named Lyft made the same dumb app.  \n\n\nTL;DR, UBER is losing investors' money.  Typically it tanks on ER.  $33p for 2/7 are real cheap and gonna print max tendies when this shit returns to sub $27", "created_utc": 1580943935, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ezicfn/uber_er_dd/", "is_self": true}
