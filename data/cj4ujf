{"id": "cj4ujf", "title": "TSLA ER FAIL SBUX ER WIN tldr; blew some of my education fund on Tesla ER, made it back plus more on Starbucks ER", "selftext": "So recently I had some funds for the remainder of my degree wired into my checking account. I let my pops know I was going to manage some of it myself, essentially swing trade it or let it sit in something passive for weeks at a time. In true WSB style, I was mostly in $TVIX and $UGAZ then slingin' some FD's here and there. I took a decent sized hit on $V ER, opened the day down a considerable amount. I went to work with the two remaining day trades I had and got in some pre earnings $TSLA FDs finishing the day roughly even, I was happy with it. Then $TSLA ER happened, quick pop up to 268, no buyers and down she went, nearly 12%. Opened the next day down even lower, I wasn't gonna fold, but I was a little more tense at this point. I went big on $TSLA calls shortly after, doubled my losses on $TSLA and took a decent chunk out of my newly acquired funds. Spent most of the rest of the day kind of sulking and feeling sorry for myself until I was sitting at my desk..10 minutes to closing bell. I noticed $SBUX ER was at the end of the day, a name I was very familiar with, had been following it for weeks, played Q3 ER of 2018 and made a considerable amount then as well. I took the remainder of what I had in my account after being down more than a couple grand and all-inned $SBUX. I sat there for minutes after the bell, it actually even moved down about 1.5% before jumping more than $6, a huge beat. I made seven grand the next morning selling shortly after the opening bell. \n\nI felt compelled to share my degeneracy with you folks here because if this story inspired even one of you, it'd be worth the fifteen minutes I spent typing it. I'll try to attach proof and everything here, thanks for being a part of my first real post on reddit. Happy FD'ing. \n\ntldr; lost a chunk of my educational funds on $TSLA ER, came back in a big way on $SBUX ER. \n\np.s. would love a flair \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[booked the initial loss, then booked some more](https://i.redd.it/mon6bvleh5d31.png)\n\n*Processing img 2zq9o8dfh5d31...*", "created_utc": 1564365934, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cj4ujf/tsla_er_fail_sbux_er_win_tldr_blew_some_of_my/", "is_self": true}
