All of WSB holding puts will be cumming uncontrollably in their pants at 9:13 am. At 9:14, you\u2019ll hear a very light hum coming from outside. You\u2019ll try to ignore it, thinking it\u2019s just a utility worker fixing something. It slowly picks up in volume until all of a sudden, you hear an impossibly loud BRRRRRT! Disoriented by the sheer loudness of the noise, you\u2019ll run outside and try to make sense of what\u2019s making that horrible, deafening sound. Upon seeing nothing that could be making such a noise, you\u2019ll look back to your phone and see that SPY starts to make the most abrupt V you\u2019ve ever seen while it was at -8.13%. Before you can even compose yourself and figure out what the fuck is going on, an amber alert goes off on your iPhone. A video starts auto-playing of Jeremy Powell dressed in joker makeup, cackling like he\u2019s a regular in Arkham Asylum. He\u2019s laughing and howling like a lunatic while he mimics the sound of an A-10 warthog. \u201cBRRRRRT HAHAHAHA! BRRRRRRRT \ud83e\udd21\u201d.\n\n\n\n\nEverything fades to black. You fainted from the sheer stress of the situation. When you finally wake up, you\u2019re dazed and confused. You\u2019re surrounded by men in cloaks, in an unfamiliar land. \u201cHey you, you\u2019re finally awake\u201d says the man across from you. Todd Howard, you son of a bitch. You did it again.", "created_utc": 1585354038.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fq972q/this_is_how_i_see_the_start_to_this_week_playing/", "is_self": true}
