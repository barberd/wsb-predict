How can WSB use this? \n\nHere are my dumb ideas\n\nIs any country on this planet is capable of waging such a frantic, total war like China to combat the Beer Virus? \n\nChina is going to be like the first kid in the family to get sick, and the first one to get better. \n\nThe worlds factory (Thats China) will be the only thing running. Even if they have no $$$ to pay the workers they'll crack the whip. Remember the ghost cities they built. \n\nTraffic might be a good indicator when Chinas health improves. \n\nNotice wuhan is not ok. Beijing looks like they're driving to and from work and thats it. With out flooding the post with screen shots, Seattle is starting to show a dip. \n\nSimply as an example, Notice $MLCO was one of the only entertainment Stonks to go up today. They are also geographical you can look up the cities they have resorts in. You could watch the cities and when you see people driving on the weekend in that city, tourism has gone up. \n\nbut not for now I am holding $LYV 3/20 47.5, $LVS 4/17 $40, MGM $20 9/18 PUTS I still see red in entertainments future.\n\nAny one else?", "created_utc": 1583546898.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/feof9j/watching_chinas_traffic_is_the_way/", "is_self": true}
