{"id": "exla50", "title": "Turbo spreads for UNLIMITED TENDIES?", "selftext": "I've heard about spreads but this seems like free money if you look at European Turbo's. Turbo's are basically just stocks but the stock is leveraged by insane amounts.\n\nFor example for GOOGL I can short with a leverage of 260x (!) and long for 30x.\n\nSo what prevents me from just putting 500 dollars in both of them to literally make garuanteed money at earnings? If the stock goes down by, say, 5%, then my 500 dollar short would become 130 000 dollars (yes, the leverage is actually that insane). If it goes up by 5% my long gains 15 000 dollars. In both situations I can lose 500 at most thanks to turbo's having an automatic stop loss.\n\nSo what prevents me from making millions with these insane spreads?", "created_utc": 1580630742, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/exla50/turbo_spreads_for_unlimited_tendies/", "is_self": true}
