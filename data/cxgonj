(What else could it be \u2013 a gift from shareholders?) And restructuring expenses? Well, maybe last year\u2019s exact rearrangement won\u2019t recur. But restructurings of one sort or another are common in business \u2013 Berkshire has gone down that road dozens of times, and our shareholders have always borne the costs of doing so.\"\n\nWorkday, Palo Alto Networks, BOX and all these other cloud cos are fleecing investors with non-GAAP. PANW for example has EPS of 5, however GAAP EPS is negative as they just print stock which is a real expense. BOX has GAAP EPS of -1, non-GAAP is 0. Why the fuck is stock-based compensation excluded in non-GAAP !", "created_utc": 1567170468, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cxgonj/nongaap_bullshit/", "is_self": true}
