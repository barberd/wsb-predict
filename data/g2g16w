It's not statistically accurate.\n\nhttps://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/\n\nThe site above is tracking all cases of CV in the world. There's been past speculation on this sub that the IHME model isn't very accurate. Looking at the recent data, that statement could be correct. Daily deaths from April 14 and 15th broke RECORDS for number of deaths per day. \n\nThe argument currently is that deaths are a lagging indicator. Fair to say. But we're having another problem as well: cases shot back up yesterday for the US, up 3,000 from the previous day. If I had to guess, Easter saw a lot of people coming together, and starting yesterday those people began experiencing the symptoms of CV.\n\nQuick aside: we've all been aware of the fact that cases miraculously decline on saturdays and sundays over this whole timeline. Is it because cases are coming down, or are labs simply having part of their workforce take the weekend as per normal work week schedules, thus reducing testing capacity?\n\nThis is not just the US either. Look at Spain's data. Yesterday they had 6,599 newly reported cases. Last time their new case numbers were that high? April 4.\n\nI'm no scientist, or statistician, but I make my money on looking at the real data and not just taking the narrative's word for it. And these new numbers are severely deviating from the consensus view of how the virus is declining.\n\nI find it implausible that when we open the country back up we will continue to see cases level off or decline when the data is currently suggesting in a full lockdown America is struggling to see new cases decline. Taking the Easter weekend as a potential reason for new case spikes, it is worrisome to see the country trying to open up when clearly this virus comes back so easily.\n\nI will of course disclaimer that I am not a scientist or a statistician, and if anyone with more expertise would have some rectification for these deviations from expected outcomes of case spread, I would welcome the correction. \n\nPosition: MAR 65P Jul 20", "created_utc": 1587047679.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2g16w/this_might_be_the_deadliest_covid_week_for/", "is_self": true}
