Jim Cramer and Mark Cuban both said the market is overbought and Andrew Cuomo mulls over reimposing lock-down.\n\nSo you know me as the lifelong gay bear that didn't cash out the 95k on my VXX calls last friday. This market has no legs. Fed's were not doing QE, they were pumping the market but JPOW stopped that last Wednesday. But they left this market with a false pattern (leading to the kangaroo investor).\n\nBut these kangaroos are actually really bears and they could still convert back to bears, and instead of bullish pressure they will go back to bears.\n\nI still have puts on big overblown companies like LULU, CMG and AZO. We're set for a massive correction.", "created_utc": 1592200136.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h9a1cm/bears_lives_matter/", "is_self": true}
