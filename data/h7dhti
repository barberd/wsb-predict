{"id": "h7dhti", "title": "TXN Wheel of Misfortune", "selftext": "Well retards I finally did something stupid enough to post about.\n\nI sold (2) TXN 125P 6/19 last week for 1.04 each. Cash covered of course, so 25K locked up.\n\nI was hoping I could pick up those pennies in front of the train a couple times before I got assigned.\n\nTXN went below 125 today, and I'm fearful I'll be assigned come next friday.\n\nIf that is the case, I pray TXN doesn't dive too far below 125 so I can sell (2) 130C's biweekly for a decent premium and lower my cost basis.\n\nIf TXN pops back up above 130 my 200 shares will be called away for $1000 profit plus what premiums I will have collected on the way.\n\nAutists, pray I don't have this much money locked up for more than 2 months. Give my dumb ass strength that I follow through according to the strategy.", "created_utc": 1591934084.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h7dhti/txn_wheel_of_misfortune/", "is_self": true}
