Now my bearish thesis is \"at what point do 12 year olds stop FOMOing into an overvalued 10 year bull market\". \n\nMoney printer go brrrr is great for a short term trade congrats to call holders, although there are good reasons this will not last. \n\nA lot of players are not providing a bid for this market to continue. The only ones who are confidently buying are RH traders. Top of book depth in notional value has declined to alarming levels. Since most of you have only been trading for two weeks, this basically means that there is nothing but air on the upside and downside of the market. This is why the market goes down 6% in a day, and then up 3% the next. It takes less money to move the market because there are less participants willing to take on the risk. \n\nThink of the depth of book as the amount of chairs in a game of musical chairs. In 2019 there were a lot of chairs for people to take a seat. Now, the only players left are RH traders while the world watches. Carl Icahn took a chair, Warren Buffet took a chair, the god damn algos who provide the bid and ask on the book took a chair. \n\nAgain, congrats to the euphoric call holders who are printing money like JPow. However, people are becoming suicidal on this sub reddit and it is hard for me to watch. \n\nThe daily percentage moves in the futures market are getting larger, so please take that into account. Do not go all in and please do not trade away all your life savings if you have been doing this for less than a year. If you have been trading for less than one year, keep 90% of your savings in a bank account. Use 10% for YOLOs. If you lose that 10% allocated for YOLOing, take a 6 month break from trading at least. This is simple risk management. \n\nI am not telling anyone to buy puts or calls, who the fuck knows where the market is going to be next week. I am just trying to say the market is beyond fucked right now. People are gambling their life savings and killing themselves over it. It has to stop. \n\nTLDR; Stop gambling ALL of your life savings. There is no more liquidity on the book. Market can move very quick up or down without any news. If you are new and going to gamble, use a small portion of your savings, so that if you lose, you will not want to kill yourself.", "created_utc": 1592319957.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ha5qqy/when_does_buyer_fatigue_set_in/", "is_self": true}
