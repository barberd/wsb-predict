The responses are available after you take it.  I'm pretty sure this doesn't violate posting guidelines but please inform me if it does.  Scrolling in recent posts I see one survey that was from some fucking loser trying to conduct research from some piece of shit app he probably never built, I ain't about that shit, this post is entirely for our (my) enjoyment.\n\n[https://forms.gle/zvi17yAhUSzL7vTc7](https://forms.gle/zvi17yAhUSzL7vTc7)\n\nThe questions are:\n\n*How large is your \"Investing\" portfolio?*\n\n*How much have you made or lost over the course of your \"Investing\" career?*\n\n*Years of experience \"Investing\"*\n\n*Trading Platform*\n\n*Which do you consider part of your trading strategy?*\n\n*What is your favorite stock to play? (Ticker only)*\n\n*Are you retarded enough to play HTZ?*\n\n*What best describes you? (select all that apply)*\n\nIf you have other question ideas (that are good) then I'll add them.  I'll post some graphs of the responses if I get enough.  Also if you guys think this is stupid, be sure to tell me, over and over again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Added age and location", "created_utc": 1593317890.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hh85bo/for_fun_i_made_a_wsb_survey/", "is_self": true}
