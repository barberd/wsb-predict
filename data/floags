Malls have been dying for years now, including the retailers within them like Sears, Belks, Macys etc. It\u2019s a terrible business model. Malls are essentially highly leveraged retail outlets that can\u2019t possibly survive mandatory closures. The government won\u2019t be there to bail them out. They\u2019re focused on bailing out airlines and manufacturers to preserve logistics and production.\n\nTL;DR: Buy puts on shopping mall operators such as SPG. Wait for them to go bankrupt due to closures.
