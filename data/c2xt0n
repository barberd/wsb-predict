Shs shorted increased by 563k, +10.41%, in June even though its stock price rose +62.58%. Shorts are down -$558 million, in mark-to-market YTD losses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the borrow rates have been rising for the past few days. In calling around, I got 83% yesterday morning, 88% yesterday afternoon, 90% at market open, and 93% as of a few minutes ago. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStinks to be down, but the thesis of a squeeze remains intact for me so I am still holding. It might be a bad decision, though. I am not a financial advisor and I don't know what I am doing. If you are AT ALL nervous about losing this money, just get out while it is $160 and not $40. This is very overvalued and the company is not a good business to be in.", "created_utc": 1561046451, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c2xt0n/bynd_borrow_rates_from_s3/", "is_self": true}
