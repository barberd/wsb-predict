The results of this research should not be generalized over thousands of weeks of earnings releases. Proceed at your own risk.)\n\nToday, we will be analyzing the outcomes of impartially investing into companies, holding all else constant, in anticipation of their earnings releases. There is no doubt that earnings season is a fascinating period, where otherwise low beta stocks have the potential to move double digit percentages on an improved (or retracted) outlook on a company's guidance. For more speculative investments, a beat or miss can provide even greater movement. And with these movements, of course, comes the possibility of major gains. Who doesn't like major gains?\n\nBut the disappointing reality is that attempting to play earnings is nothing more than glorified speculation. And when you consider the enabling attitude of online communities, caution is thrown to the wind. In a 2015 article by [Market Watch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/avoid-gambling-on-earnings-results-2015-01-22), they argue that:\n\n>\"In fact, anyone who takes positions ahead of a stock's earnings release in anticipation of a stock's move is speculating and gambling, and although it is a very popular practice by smaller investors, more seasoned investors tend to avoid taking positions at that time. They realize that they do not know where the stock will move, even if they are confident in their earnings predictions because stocks often move in surprising ways after earnings releases.\"\n\nAnd as is further pointed out, premiums leading up to earnings can be run up to exceptional levels, and unless you are trading an inherently volatile stock that usually maintains high option premiums, premiums can fall off a cliff following earnings, no matter the direction. The article goes on to point out additional risks with playing the earnings \"guessing game.\"\n\nOk, that seems pretty intuitive. But I think there is a competitive advantage to be had, somewhere, someway. Right? Markets cannot be 100% efficient: dissemination of information is not perfect. What if then, we could attempt to find this competitive advantage. We could backtrack to previous earnings, evaluate current earnings, and screen across different fundamentals to see if there are any discernible trends. What could go wrong.\n\nSo, I sought to ignorantly invest in all companies reporting earnings over the week of 5/11 to 5/15, and evaluate whether there were any interesting insights we could come up with.\n\n# Methodology:\n\nAs you can tell from the title, this post is Part 1 of an ongoing series of posts, week to week, evaluating earnings under this lens. With this being said, the methodology I use in this first week is...primitive (to say the least) but will be refined week to week, targeting an end goal of identifying an observable trend.\n\n1. **Timeline.** For this report, I will be evaluating earnings reports covering the trading week beginning 5/11 and ending 5/15. In the future, I plan on backtesting previous weeks once we've refined our methodology. For the time being, we will be forward looking.\n2. **What Earnings to \"Play?\"** For this analysis, I will be referencing earningswhispers.com's \"**Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for the trading week beginning \\[insert Monday of chosen week\\]\"** earnings calendar. If you aren't familiar with r/EarningsWhispers, they create weekly earnings \"calendars\" that detail popular companies' earnings reports for a given week, organized based on date and time of release (before market open or after market close). Having worked in-depth with their calendars while setting up this analysis, I feel that their calendars represent a solid mixture of companies, specifically diverse in risk (value/growth), market capitalization (large/small/micro), and sectors, and industries. For this report, I will be referencing [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarningsWhispers/comments/gghsn7/most_anticipated_earnings_releases_for_the/) earnings calendar. If there are any recommendations for services with more comprehensive report coverage, please let me know.\n3. **Investment Size.** To ensure that we were able to buy into all companies (no matter how high their share price was), I designated $1000 per investment. I tested again using $100 per investment, and the percentage difference was negligible. Besides, with fractional shares accessible on major platforms, investment size is less about concern and more about standardizing the return % we get.\n4. **Security of Choice and Holding Period.** For my first iteration of this project, I decided to invest using common stocks instead of options. Although options are the go-to choice for playing earnings, I figured starting with fewer variables, i.e. common stocks, would be a good foundation. Later on, I'd be interested in redoing these scenarios with options. For each stocks' holding period, I chose a 24-hour timeframe in order to minimize non-earnings influences. My rationale was as follows. For BO stock, purchasing the stock at close the day before the pre-market earnings release would reasonably approximate the markets anticipation of earnings pre-market and reaction to earnings through the following trading day, eliminating the impact of non-earnings news as much as possible. I applied this same rationale to the AO stock, however it is more difficult to approximate because the market's accessibility to anticipation/reaction prices is flipped: anticipation for a BO stock is purely institutional investors (while reaction comes from the broader market) while anticipation for an AO stock comes from the broader market (while the subsequent reaction following earnings is from after-hours trading). Being said, I'm considering playing around with different holding periods to more efficiently block out non-earnings movement and encompass earnings movement. If you have any suggestions, drop below. The investment schedule is as follows (modeling the beginning of the week):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5/8/20 4:00 PM - Purchased BO Stock\n\n5/11/20 9:30 AM - Purchased AO Stock\n\n5/11/20 4:00PM - Sold BO Stock\n\n5/12/20 9:30AM - Sold AO Stock\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReiterating above, this methodology is very basic, but will be improved as we go forward. From the below results, I already have a few interesting ideas for future earnings investments, including: purchasing based on P/E versus industry P/E, sector, revisions in last 30 days, RSI, 72 hour holding period, etc.\n\n# Data:\n\n|Date|Before Market Return|After Market Return|Total Return|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|5/11|(-$229/$8934): -2.56%|($1381/$9816): 14.1%|($1152/$18571): 6%|\n|5/12|(-$277/$9880): -2.81%|(-$226/$8881): -2.54%|(-$503/$18761): -2.6%|\n|5/13|($650/$8951): 7.26%|($-531/$8808): -6.02%|($119/$17760): 0.6%|\n|5/14|($360/$9791): 3.69%|($975/$8870): 11%|($1336/$18662): 7.1%|\n|5/15|(-$98/$8953): 1.00%|N/A|(-$98/$8953): 1.00%|\n|Total|||($2006/$82887): 2.40%|\n|Total|**DOW:** \\-2.30%|**SPY:** \\-1.50%|**Earnings:** 2.40%|\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Date|Largest BM Mover|Largest AM Mover|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|5/11|\\-9.7% ($UAA)|96.97% ($NVAX)|\n|5/12|20.3% ($NSPR), -19.32% ($CSPR)|28.37% ($ISR)|\n|5/13|35% ($EFOI)|\\-20% ($SDC)|\n|5/14|25.3% ($ETM)|49.1% ($ACB)|\n|5/15|15.5% ($DKNG)|N/A|\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Positive Gains|Negative Gains|Neutral Gains|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|40|43|2|\n\n# Results:\n\nDespite the fact that our earnings investments outperformed the market last week, there are a few anomalies to account for. Most importantly, the average positive gain was larger than the average negative gain. Despite the fact there were more negative gains, positive gains usually sent the stock proportionally higher. This is demonstrated through major movers like $NVAX and $ACB, which made up 73% ($1450/$2006) of total gains for the week. As I continue to comb through the results, I will update this section of the post. If you find anything interesting, please comment and I will add it.\n\nIf you would like to see the raw data, the spreadsheet is linked [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wIfzRnjqUy6_xfuecrfECEskgLy1UcAG8KrmaZH-DJA/edit?usp=sharing).
