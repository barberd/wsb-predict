{"id": "hecl9g", "title": "Digesting PCG News", "selftext": "PCG is a ticker I follow since I live in CA and my company mainly deals with fund of funds involving energy and oil. I have been seeing 3-4 posts/wk here and some misguided stocktwits about the ranging nature of PCG, and because of the news coming, I wanted to relay why I became long on PCG (shares) yesterday and why I plan to add more. Far dated calls (Sept & later) can be a play as well.\n\n-The stock offering is nothing new, it was part of the bk exit plan, and the consensus is that the offering will be better than expected to appease the victims' trust and all interested parties involved\n\n-We've been seeing a lot more interest from institutions and funds the past couple weeks and with July 1st as the tentative exit date from BK, these excluded investors who couldn't buy while in bankruptcy will come in. My company has also interest in adding PCG because it holds up well in a down market at these prices.\n\n-Big named funds like Appaloosa and Baupost committed to adding more shares. Since this is one of the biggest bk exits in the U.S., there is a long list of underwriters such as Goldman, Morgan, and others that will accumulate shares. Institutions and funds love when big name players get into a ticker.\n\n-The current issue will set a floor, this will likely get pumped up to get a higher close before 7/1. $10 is a strong support w/ a confluence of price & trend lines. Shares should stabilize here and possibly climb closer to $12 by 7/1 because the victims' trust value can not fall further under the 6.75 billion amount. There will be backlash if that were the case; PCG, institutions, and all interested parties will only benefit by buoying up the stock price.\n\n-Indicators show extreme oversold, while at the same time accumulation for buyers. Short sellers have taken advantage of the uncertainty before bankruptcy exit to shake out weak hands. However with a near dated certainty now, the profit potential for shorts has waned because there can be price spikes any moment.\n\n-Likely see some form of a short squeeze\n\n-Our valuation of a forward P/E ratio of 2.52, also EPS growth is accelerating, so growth in the next 2 years will be better than the last few. Fundamentals indicate a cheap valuation to hold for the long term w/ a coming short term spike\n\nPositions: Shares & 9/18c $20", "created_utc": 1592910233.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hecl9g/digesting_pcg_news/", "is_self": true}
