{"id": "fyh8wq", "title": "How WSB is bailing out billionaires and hedge funds.", "selftext": "Let's keep it simple - the FED is providing assets to avoid a liquidity crisis.  Their most recent announcement that they'll be facilitating purchase of below investment grade corporate bonds (also called junk bonds) was expected...although it came much faster than it should have.\n\nWho holds below investment grade corporate bonds? Many 'companies' and now pension funds (as mass downgrades are coming).\n\nStarting with giant Pension Funds - these have ridiculous required returns (usually 7% or above) which makes them take in high risk assets like crappy corporate bonds.  Why do they have these required returns? They need to stay well funded to keep paying out, it's just math (based on the crappy initial funding which was decided on by  some 'intelligent' CEO/leader).  These 'leaders' decided to structure them this way to entice people to work for their organization.  Dandy, except for the whole high risk part.\n\nTaking a look at the 'companies' - simply put if you roll them back to the final holding company it usually as a few shareholders (billionaires) or is a hedge fund.\n\nSo why is the FED intervening on behalf of hedge funds and billionaires? That should be obvious.\n\nNow lets take a break and look at what happens if the FED wouldn't intervene.  Pension Funds have to dump junk bonds or are left holding the bag. AND crappy companies go bankrupt.  This can be called austerity.  Very scary media stuff.  But what actually happens if we allow crappy companies to go bankrupt...the poor employees who are invested in the company actually own more of it.  That's not a bad thing, go bankrupt, employees own more, actually rebuild the company after firing the crappy leadership that put them in this situation in the first place.  \n\nNow to you WSB.  Yes, you're right that your puts should have printed...the economy is heading to the toilet...your sweet $ went directly to the counter party you agreed to pay if you were wrong...guess what that counter party is likely a hedge fund/ultra wealthy person who knew the FED would step in.  We can choose to ignore the fact that BlackRock had a conversation with the government and then were allocated $500B to spend on investment grade corporate bonds including buying their own ETF.  How would like to be given $ to 'save the economy' and instead you just buy a Tesla? Well the media would say that you did your job, some factory worker is getting paid to make you the Tesla but nevermind that it only cost the American Economy $500B to buy a Tesla (aka billionaire spending, trickle down bs).\n\nTl;dr\n\nYour puts are going to hedge funds and billionairs that know the government is bailing them out specifically and sticking the tab to the American people and economy.\n\nPS. When the FED buys junk bonds to keep crappy companies afloat to keep the ultra wealthy (who own a lot of these crappy bonds) happy you create Zombie companies.  Zombie companies are essentially really shitty companies that suck at what they do and provide really little value to the economy but are subsidized by the people.
