My conclusions are as follows:\n\n1. You cannot rely on the market to *always* do anything.  The market is completely crazy and often defies trends, particularly in periods of volatility, except:\n2. The American indices have consistently moved together, even in times of volatility, and\n3. US Treasury yields (10-Year) and gold seem to generally oppose each other, though with a bit weaker correlation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith  respect to the question of stocks and treasuries, it seems much less appropriate to view these as linked assets at all.  In some periods, these have correlated positively; in others, negatively; and in some, not at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBeyond  this, I'll let the data speak for itself, as it bears witness to the pure insanity of the markets--especially within the past few weeks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith  that said, a few pointers on how to navigate the visualizations, as they are quite different than most stock charts.  The X and Y axes each represent the closing price (in the first visualization) or daily price  change (in the second and third) of one security.  Each dot represents  one point in time, showing the closing price (or daily price change) for one security on one axis compared with the same information for a  different security on the other.  The progression of time is represented  by the changing color of the dot, with a key at the top of the visualization; unlike in most charts, time does not have its own axis.  Here, you can \"follow\" the progression of time by starting with the red  dots and moving toward the green ones.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne  additional note: this is not investment advice.  Do with it what you will, but I take no responsibility for your actions--smart or otherwise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-vamostoros\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR  If you want to play 3D chess, you have to read more than one line.\n\nSPY Apr 270C, AMD Apr 49C, TQQQ 3/27 55C, DIA May 293C (Oops...)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jmb1us6vybo41.png?width=1836&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bc22677d0e5d1d8a97b5e02e2b8acb3b0a59b2a\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2rzywpuvybo41.png?width=1836&format=png&auto=webp&s=75c2674e93258dbf595671e9da0dcf7fcabe9ade", "created_utc": 1584929450.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fnc2so/3d_chess_the_relative_pricing_of_stocks_bonds_and/", "is_self": true}
