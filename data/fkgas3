I've known about wsb for some time now, but when this COVID stuff was stirring around December/January, I knew this was the place to come. I was blessed in that one of my loved ones is from a country in SE Asia and thus was talking to me about the virus well before the news media in the west even whispered about it. I knew it was going to be bad when it got out of China, and I told myself if it got into a western nation that I would sell all my stonks and try to actually time the market.\n\nThankfully, I did just that. While watching you retards in the meantime, I managed to ride SPY puts and VIXY calls up to the 200k spot, then the rest of my positions are getting me to where I'm at now. It has been a seriously intense last month, and my first 200k had me shaking. Its literally more than I make in over two and a half years of work. I just need to remember who I am (a fucking retard) and where I came from. The best advice I've been given by my loved ones is to treat this money like it's borrowed, as though someone gave it to me for safekeeping. Obviously I'm going to be more of a dumbass than that with it, but its helped me think more carefully about how to handle it.\n\nPositions [https://imgur.com/s2ATbCq](https://imgur.com/s2ATbCq)\n\n[https://imgur.com/Y7a483i](https://imgur.com/Y7a483i)", "created_utc": 1584491166.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkgas3/from_70k_to_400k_in_one_month/", "is_self": true}
