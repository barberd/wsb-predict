{"id": "fps5st", "title": "Probable Coronavirus Rebound", "selftext": "I see a lot of people assuming that this will last for a maximum of 2-3 months, and then the market will rebound, or something along those lines. I think there's great reason to believe that we'll be in this for the long run, possibly up to a year.\n\nBelow is a graph of deaths chronologically through the time of the Spanish Flu.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Spanish Flu, Spring 1918- Spring 1919](https://i.redd.it/6k9go9slv5p41.gif)\n\nAlthough Coronavirus and the Spanish Flu are different diseases, they exhibit a lot of the same characteristics, the rate/method/conditions of infection being the most relevant. Both diseases are air transmittable, exhibiting a R-0 of between 2 and 3 (exponential rate of growth). I think the biggest factor that we should think about when making long term plays though is the effect of climate on viral transmission. Humidity is believed more and more to be one of the largest contributing factors of viral transmission.  \\[Studies\\]( [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333087331\\_Low\\_ambient\\_humidity\\_impairs\\_barrier\\_function\\_and\\_innate\\_resistance\\_against\\_influenza\\_infection](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333087331_Low_ambient_humidity_impairs_barrier_function_and_innate_resistance_against_influenza_infection) ) have linked high humidity to a large decrease in infection rates, and conversely, low humidity to a large increase. This is probably pretty obvious, everyone knows that there's a flu season, but the interesting part is that this (almost certainly) effects all respiratory viruses like Coronavirus.\n\n>inhalation of dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11\u2013deficient Mx1 mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.\n\nSkimming through the details here, the part I think is important is the fact that low humidity air diminishes the mucus layer. The mucus layer is one of the main defenses against respiratory illnesses, which are typically transmitted through the nose, mouth, and eyes. This is especially true with Coronavirus- I'm too lazy to find the papers but it has been confirmed multiple times that throughout the initial contagious period, a massive amount of virus clumps up in the throat, leading to the frequent airborne transmission we've all heard enough about.\n\nIf all of that is legit, this means we're probably looking at, yes, a decline in \\~2-3 months, a period of economic rebound throughout the summer, and then a significantly more potent round of virus. Do what you will with this info, but considering estimates for vaccine time frame are all hovering around a year, it appears poo will hit the turbine like never before this coming autumn and winter. (see above graph and make comparisons) I don't think I have to mention that the magnitude of this whole situation is way higher than the Spanish Flu from a global perspective, considering how intertwined global civilization is.\n\nRemember, everyone's in this together, and long term this will probably mean a larger emphasis on public health and community support if we're abiding by the example of 1918-1919. Do what you will with the info, but definitely stay safe and healthy, and stay resilient. Hard times make strong people.\n\nTL:DR-\n\n2-3 months of this shit, social/economic rebound during summer, shit possibly double fucked in autumn/winter 2020\n\nPositions-\n\nHaven't narrowed down specific options, but generally I'd say puts for 1/21 as soon as market rebounds in the summer.", "created_utc": 1585290925.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fps5st/probable_coronavirus_rebound/", "is_self": true}
