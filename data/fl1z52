Lululemon closed down all of their retail locations in the US and Europe and are prime target for puts. Their target market is high school and college girls who buy $200 leggings to go to school, Starbucks, and the gym. European rollout of their retail\nStore has been a flop as well. \n\n1. These college girls are all out of work, no money for that Lulu\n2. Schools, gyms, and Starbucks are closed. No need to purchase new outfits to wear outside\n3. Retail malls will be closed for quite some time, majority of sales are in store\n\n\nTLDR; LULU $119 3/20 and $95 4/17", "created_utc": 1584583671.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fl1z52/the_last_frontier_lulu_lululemon/", "is_self": true}
