{"id": "fc5ldy", "title": "Making the most of the WHO report", "selftext": "I assume none of you are going to read the [WHO-China Joint Mission findings](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf) but it's worth skimming. Here are some call-outs:\n\n* The original death toll (CFR = crude fatality toll) in Wuhan was 17.3%. This is for anyone with symptom onset between Jan 1 and Jan 10. 1 out of 6 dead. Refer to page 12.\n* Note that they also state a CFR of 0.7% for those with symptom onset after Feb 1. But don't get excited by the news. First jump to Page 14: \"Among patients who have died, the time from symptom onset to outcome ranges from 2-8 weeks.\" Now ask yourself why anyone would report a CFR for post-Feb 1 symptom on-set when they know that it takes 2-8 weeks for death to set in and the report had a final submission date of Feb 28.\n* The most interested piece to me is this. Page 12: \"13.8% have severe disease...and 6.1% are critical.\" Now jump to the Detailed Technical Findings section, page 32: \"About a quarter of severe and critical cases require mechanical ventilation while the remaining 75% require only oxygen supplementation.\"\n\nBasically, the original 17.3% CFR in Wuhan was most everyone who was Severe or Critical and couldn't get proper care. Now lets do the math for \"mechanical ventilation\": (13.8% severe + 6.1% critical) x 1/4 = 5%. **5% of cases need mechanical ventilation.** When this hits hard, people die if the hospital doesn't have enough mechanical ventilators.\n\nAll right, now tell me what we short and where we go long. Who is best suited to roll out a whole bunch of ventilators to cover the 5% of people who will need it?", "created_utc": 1583118311, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fc5ldy/making_the_most_of_the_who_report/", "is_self": true}
