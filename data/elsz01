{"id": "elsz01", "title": "Weirdest bets", "selftext": "Bought PZZA leaps when the CEO got in trouble saying the n word in 2018. The stock tanked at the time and my rationale was that a CEO saying the n word has no impact on the underlying business or tastiness of Papa John\u2019s Pizza. The only risk was that people would boycott, but that was be unlikely since most people\u2019s activism is just tweeting so others can see that they have the correct point of view. Up 103% on the position and wish I\u2019d bet a more substantial amount.
