Also, while I don\u2019t think the Coronavirus is a threat to any of us, it\u2019s still worth discussing the economic impact. \n\nFirst, the stocks most dependent on China: https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/06/here-are-the-companies-wall-street-is-worried-most-about-if-a-full-blown-trade-war-breaks-out.html\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-stocks-exposure-china-185734394.html\n\nThe yahoo link is a little old but use the info as you wish. WYNN reported earnings today and they missed, also reported they\u2019re losing 2-2.5 million US dollars a day. Their Macau casinos will remain shut for 2 weeks minimum. The semiconductors are all way up on the list as well, and are suffering as most of China\u2019s manufacturing has remained shut down (80% of it). Apple supplier Foxconn also delayed the opening of production in Shenzhen, told employees not to return, and lowered its 2020 outlook due to drop in manufacturing. Apple has further delayed the reopening of its retail stores in China. All of these companies (Semis, Apple, Nike, etc) not only rely on China for revenue/sales, but also manufacturing. \n\nMost of the semis released earnings recently, prior to any realizing the virus could have a large effect on revenue and supply. I\u2019ll be playing $MRVL earnings for early March, and watching the casinos (WYNN, MGM) into next earnings. If they pop up a bit in the coming weeks I\u2019ll grab some puts for mid May/June because their quarters are going to be poor. Same goes for the other semis with large China exposure. \n\nI also expect a SPY pull back just due to the size of the Chinese economy and the length to which it\u2019s been mostly shut down. Additionally, the virus seems to be spreading at a continuous pace with no signs of slowing yet (within China). They can pump a few billion into the market, but that doesn\u2019t come close to making up for the lost revenues and manufacturing from the second largest economy.", "created_utc": 1581119214, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f0j6s6/china_and_the_upcoming_weeks/", "is_self": true}
