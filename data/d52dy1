{"id": "d52dy1", "title": "[LONG] Revolve ($RVLV) heading into October trade talks and 11/5 Q3 earnings", "selftext": "**SITUATION OVERVIEW**\n\nRevolve Group IPO\u2019d 11.8M shares on June 6, 2019 at $18/share (implied market cap $1.23B). Shares rose 180% to $50 in the ensuing two weeks, a move driven by a Citron report with a $50 price target and high investor appetite for IPOs that summer. Shares then plummeted after hitting an ATH on June 19. Even a decent Q2 report on August 8 (beat on \u201cconsensus\u201d Revenue, small miss on EPS) failed to reverse sentiment; instead, shares fell another 15% after earnings. Recently, RVLV seems to have found support around \\~$21/share. Trade war concerns have likely overshadowed strong fundamentals, and shares should see some upward momentum heading into the October U.S.-China negotiations.      \n\n**BUSINESS OVERVIEW** \n\nRevolve is a leading online fashion retailer for Generation Z and Millennial women (ages 18-44). In the 12 months ended 3/31/2019, Revolve\u2019s websites generated 9.8 million unique visitors per month, 56% of which came from free and low-cost sources. In fact, Revolve\u2019s customer acquisition costs are some of the lowest in the industry. Revolve spends \\~$38 to acquire a new customer. E-retail competitors like Farfetch spend \\~$100\u2014and that number is rising. While Revolve\u2019s CACs have increased modestly over the last few years (CAC was $30 in 2014), contribution margins and customer lifetime value are also rising. \n\nRevolve drives this outperformance through innovative marketing efforts that target social media influencers. In 2009, Revolve began shipping free samples of its products to influencers. Today, Revolve continues to cater engaging content through a network of over 3,500 influencers. These influencers wear free Revolve merchandise, vacation on Revolve\u2019s dime, and attend Revolve-exclusive parties\u2014all while documenting the experience on Instagram.\n\nIn 2018 alone, 75% of marketing spend ($55M) went to performance marketing efforts like the Revolve Festival at Coachella. Revolve has taken a leaf from the Kering and LVMH playbook by curating a lifestyle around its brands. But instead of peddling $1,000 pumps and $10,000 handbags, Revolve strikes a premium price point ($275 average order size as of Q2 2019). I have not come across any lifestyle brands that have executed this specific strategy as well as Revolve has. \n\nRevolve currently segments its revenues and gross profit between two sites: REVOLVE ($258 average order size in FY18) and FORWARD ($653 average order size in FY18). Both websites offer a product mix of apparel, footwear, and accessories. The REVOLVE site sells merchandise from \u201cemerging\u201d third party brands (42% of net sales), Revolve-owned brands (31%), and established third party brands (26%)\u2014850 brands in total. Here, Revolve has seen immense success developing and selling its own 21 brands. Owned brands represent 8 of the top 10 brands on REVOLVE. 4 of the top 5 search terms that led to a purchase at REVOLVE came from owned brands. \n\nThe FORWARD site sells luxury fashion from brands like Gucci, Fendi, and Balenciaga\u2014250 brands in total. FORWARD comprised 12% of sales in the LTM, and REVOLVE the remaining 88%. Revolve has also dipped its toes in beauty, menswear, and lower-price apparel. In Q2 2019, Revolve launched the website superdown, which strikes the $40-$60 price range for most SKUs and targets Gen Z women. \n\n**MANAGEMENT** \n\nCo-Founders and -CEOs Michael Mente and Michael Karanikolas demonstrate management expertise, having grown Revolve to a $1B valuation with only $15M in outside capital from TSG Consumer Partners since 2003. Together, they own 68% of 57M Class B shares post-IPO (a combined \\~$900M as of September 2019).      \n\n**THESIS**\n\n**Revolve has a path to 100% upside by 2021 with relatively low execution risk**\u200b. The Company is poised to capture significant market share from legacy retailers by capitalizing on a changing retail shopping experience. In doing so, Revolve is also building brand equity in a portfolio of premium-fashion brands; customers view these not as private labels, but as highly desirable and independent peers to other established third-party brands on the REVOLVE website. And as Revolve realizes a more favorable owned mix, it will enjoy stickier revenue, higher margins, and more efficient use of working capital. Numerous additional growth engines can and will propel the Company beyond its current demographics and segments. These include: beauty, mens\u2019, accessories and footwear, and international, among others. \n\nTrading at 2.6x 2019E Revenue and 29x 2019E Adj. EBITDA, Revolve looks appropriately valued relative to peers. However, I have high confidence in management\u2019s ability to satisfy annual targets given a long track record of successful execution and the fundamental merits of the business model. Very few retailers boast a 6.2x 4-year LTV/CAC and 89% net sales retention. \n\nAn investment in Revolve is an investment in:  \n \u274f technology-first operators with considerable skin in the game  \n \u274f a data-driven sourcing and fulfillment back-end  \n \u274f an integrated stack of e-commerce websites  \n \u274f a social media presence that reaches tens of millions of eyeballs \u274f a growing suite of owned and diversified brands  \n \u274f the future of fashion retail      \n\n**TARGET MARKET AND INDUSTRY TRENDS** \n\nThere are 57 million Americans in Revolve\u2019s target market of 18- to 44-year-old women. While only a small proportion of them has (1) the discretionary income and (2) the fashion sense to shop at Revolve, the market is far from saturated. Management estimates that their target demographic is less than &lt;3% penetrated worldwide. Revolve retained 1.2M active customers in 2018; this implies a global market of 40M active customers. \n\nMore than ever before, consumers\u2014especially women\u2014are buying clothes online. The U.S. online apparel, footwear, accessories, and beauty market was $117B in 2018; it is expected to grow at a 13.2% CAGR to $170B in 2021. Social media use is amplifying this trend. Customers are increasingly discovering and transacting via websites like Instagram, which lead in brand engagement. In March 2019, Revolve announced a partnership with Instagram as one of the first retailers to offer in-app checkout. \n\nOf course, legacy department stores compete in e-commerce as well. But they offer a value proposition materially different to Revolve\u2019s. The big boxes (e.g. Nordstrom, Amazon) target too broad of a demographic, offer ubiquitous brands, and react slowly to fashion trends. Revolve, in contrast, has carved out a niche that caters to fashion-forward Millennial and Gen Z women specifically. Furthermore, Revolve has developed a reputation for seamless customer experience: free 2-3 day shipping, free returns, 24/7 customer service, order tracking, 90-day warranties, etc. \n\n**OUTSTANDING E-RETAIL PERFORMANCE** \n\nRevolve boasts some of the most impressive e-commerce performance and metrics in the industry. Management has made LTV/CAC data available on every annual cohort of customers since 2014. The 2014 cohort in particular exhibits a 3-year LTV/CAC of 5x and a 4-year LTV/CAC of more than 6x. Expectedly, this ratio has deteriorated slightly\u2014today\u2019s customers are more expensive to acquire. The effect is offset slightly by improving contribution margins and growing LTV. \n\nRevolve also tracks customer retention by cohort. On average over the \u201814, \u201815, \u201816, and \u201817 cohorts, Revolve retained 62% of the cohorts\u2019 net sales from the year in which it acquired a customer (Year 0) to the next year (Year 1), and 102% of the cohort\u2019s net sales from Year 1 to Year 2. Surprisingly, retention has been improving with successive cohorts. In 2014, Revolve retained 84% of the prior year\u2019s net sales. In 2018, Revolve retained 89% of the prior year\u2019s net sales. \n\nThese metrics speak to growing customer loyalty, satisfaction, and stickiness at Revolve. \n\n**GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY DRIVERS** \n\n\u274f  **Sophisticated inventory management and small-batch offerings**   \n By some counts, Revolve is a technology company that also happens to sell clothing. Their back-end leverages millions of historical and real-time data points about customer preferences to capitalize on fashion trends and source inventory accordingly. By ordering in limited quantities, Revolve has also succeeded in generating a sense of urgency around its products. 79% of net sales in FY18 were made at full price, suggesting that this strategy is working. Return rates are slightly under 50%\u2014in line with industry standards. \n\n\u274f  **Growth in owned brand penetration**   \n Revolve has created 21 brands (with more on the way). These owned brands generate greater productivity per style2, larger average order sizes, and higher gross margins. REVOLVE\u2019s brand mix also represents a moat against competition. \u201cEmerging\u201d (see: less widely known) third party and owned brands collectively drive 70% of sales at REVOLVE. Therefore, there is less overlap between REVOLVE\u2019s product offering and those of other e-retailers. \n\n\u274f  **International sales growth**   \n Non-Americans comprise 45% of the social media following across Revolve\u2019s Instagram accounts, but drive only 18% of sales. A more seamless international ordering experience could bridge this gap. Management ranks its international customer experience, in order of best to worst: UK, Western Europe, Australia, Canada, Asia. It recently completed \u201clocalization\u201d efforts in the UK to improve fulfillment. More Western European countries are on the way. \n\n\u274f  **Enhanced product mix and target demographics**  \n Men\u2019s fashion has historically not sold as well through Instagram, but that too is beginning to   \n change. Net-A-Porter has seen massive success with its men\u2019s offering, Mr. Porter ($2.5B FY17 Revenue, 1.1M Instagram followers for @mrporterlive). REVOLVE MAN exists, but needs a dedicated website, in my opinion. Beauty is another area that Revolve has begun to develop, but that involvement is still in its infancy. \n\nManagement stated on the Q2 2019 call that men\u2019s and beauty will take the backburner; legacy REVOLVE, FORWARD, and superdown will take priority in the near-future. As an investor, I would rather buy into a management team that does a few things well rather than many things poorly. \n\n\u274f  **Recurrence of growth at FORWARD**   \n Revenue growth at FORWARD turned negative in FY18 (-5.5% YoY) and Q1 2019 (-9.8% YoY). Management attributes the decline to its decision to reset inventory levels and refresh the product mix. Resultantly, average order size and active users have fallen over the last several quarters. In Q2 2019, growth turned positive once again (+14.6% YoY). Q2 2018 may have simply been an easy quarter to lap, but I buy management\u2019s explanation. \n\n\u274f  **Lower entry point merchandise via superdown**   \n 33% of Revolve\u2019s social following belongs to Generation Z. These younger customers have lower discretionary income than Millenials. superdown\u2014Revolve\u2019s answer to lower-price retailers like Urban Outfitters and ASOS\u2014could draw hundreds of thousands of new customers into the Revolve ecosystem. Some cannibalization is to be expected, but Gen Z and Millennial tastes differ enough to segment products between two websites and price points. My own experiences confirm that Gen Z is a substantial growth opportunity: Several of my female friends are aware of Revolve and would like to shop there, but find it too expensive for their budgets. \n\n**TRADE WAR**  \nRecent price action likely reflects Revolve\u2019s trade war exposure. I believe management has greater flexibility around trade issues than the market is giving credit for. First, Revolve does not disclose the geographic breakdown of inventory, but leaves some clues in the S-1: \n\n\u274f  \u201cWe do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. \u200b**We use multiple third-party suppliers and manufacturers based primarily in China** and, \u200b**to a lesser extent, the United States and India** to source and manufacture all of our products under our owned brands. We engage our third- party suppliers and manufacturers on a \u200b**purchase order basis and are not party to long-term contracts**\u200b with any of them\u201d (24). \n\n\u274f  \u201cThe U.S. government has recently imposed increased tariffs on certain imports from China. While **the current tariffs only affect a small portion of the products that we currently import from China, specifically handbags and makeup, the current U.S. administration has increased the tariff rate from 10% to 25% and indicated that the higher tariffs may be imposed on additional imports from China, including finished goods apparel and shoes**\u200b, which, if imposed, would include a predominant portion of the products that we import from China\u201d (40). \n\nThe majority of Revolve\u2019s inventory\u2014particularly for owned brands\u2014is sourced from China, though most of its imports are not (yet) subject to tariffs. On the Q2 call, management cited the following mitigants: \n\n1) REVOLVE and FORWARD customers are less elastic to price than those of discount retailers. They argue that customers are more interested in what\u2019s \u201cnew and exciting\u201d than finding the best price for a particular SKU/style \n\n2)  Management has strong relationships with vendors in China; in a world with prolonged tariffs, Revolve could offset some costs to Vendors (it has leverage in threatening to switch to apparel   \n markets like Thailand or Vietnam, for instance) \n\n3)  Revolve has plans to diversify inventory sources over the next 12-18 months. As such, the trade   \n war represents only a short-to-medium-term headwind \n\nThe latter two points are admittedly more compelling than the first. As an investor in Revolve, I am also pleased to learn that Revolve sources inventory via purchase order rather than contract; switching costs should theoretically be lower during a supply chain relocation. I do not have sufficient information to assess the impact of a protracted trade war, but Revolve has some levers it can pull. \n\n**VALUATION** \n\nRelative to other e-commerce peers, Revolve looks fairly valued in the context of its 2019E revenue growth and profitability. I used sell-side consensus numbers from CapitalIQ.\n\nI value Revolve on multiples of both 2021E Revenue and 2021E Adj. EBITDA. My estimates do not differ materially from sell-side, though I assume no growth in the FORWARD segment and instead take a more bullish view on top-line growth at REVOLVE. I am forecasting $893M in 2021E Revenue and $110M in 2021E Adj. EBITDA.\n\nI present a wide range of enterprise value multiples to reflect uncertainty over long-term growth prospects and account for a potentially weaker retail market in 2021. The valuation would have to fall to below 1.7x 2021E Revenue or 14x 2021E Adj. EBITDA for investors to incur a loss on the position\u2014both of which are relatively unlikely given the strengths of the business discussed hitherto. Even at a relatively conservative 20x 2021E Adj. EBITDA, RVLV would trade at a 43% premium to current prices. On consistent earnings momentum, the name could very well double in the next 2-3 years.   \n\n**Q2 2019 RESULTS** \n\nQuarter 2, 2019 (ended June 30) was Revolve\u2019s first quarter as a publicly-traded company. Q2 has historically been Revolve\u2019s best quarter due to higher volumes in anticipation of the summer months. \n\nThe Company missed slightly on Non-GAAP EPS and beat slightly on revenue. Forecasting is difficult for even the most experienced management teams, and Revolve should get better at it with time. \n\nManagement confirmed the completion of a new warehouse facility that will provide capacity beyond 2021. Lower FCF of \\~$2M during the quarter was the result of higher capex for this fulfillment facility. Management also instituted revenue guidance of $598M-$608M and Adj. EBITDA guidance of $51M-$56M for FY19. \n\nHeading into Q3 2019, RVLV should benefit from the recent launch of superdown. \n\n**tl;dr: Buy RVLV 12/20 $30's**", "created_utc": 1568648338, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d52dy1/long_revolve_rvlv_heading_into_october_trade/", "is_self": true}
