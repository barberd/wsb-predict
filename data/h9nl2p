Consistent growth, profits, recession resistant and pays out dividends.\n\nI've looked into KO, WMT, LMT, DIS, MSFT and a few other boomer as fuck stocks but i wanna know if there's an ultimate boomer stock i can't find? like 5% dividends, consistent growth, a bunch of ceos with receeding hairlines and don't care about employee safety or paying a decent wage.\n\nFollow up: what's your experience with investing in boomer stocks and is there a better strat for consistent growth i haven't seen. \n\nThanks; appreciate the advice :)", "created_utc": 1592251007.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h9nl2p/whats_the_best_boomer_stock/", "is_self": true}
