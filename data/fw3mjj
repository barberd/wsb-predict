To solve this problem, $BYND needs to make \u201cBeyond Bat\u201d.  Same great bat taste that you\u2019re accustomed to, but without all the global pandemics.  They need to act quick, before Impossible Foods copies them and makes \u201cImpossible Bat Burgers\u201d. \n\nBYND can get Ozzy Osbourne to be the spokesman and face of the company.  They can make commercials where Ozzy safely eats the bat burger. They can get all the former actors who played Batmen to endorse it too as it prevents the needless slaughter of the almighty bat and we don\u2019t want to piss off all the \u201csave the bats\u201d environmentalists. \n\nTLDR; Buy $BYND calls; fake bat meat will replace tendies as the best thing since sliced bread.", "created_utc": 1586196249.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fw3mjj/how_bynd_can_prevent_the_next_pandemic/", "is_self": true}
