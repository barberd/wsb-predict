I hope this post finds everyone well.\n\nAfter quite the hectic 2 years of college, 6 years of either bearable or overall bad mental health and a break up from the most serious relationship I've ever had and probably will have a for a while, I finally decided to tell my family I want to take a break for at least one school term for my mental health. Before people worry or meme my mental health, I am a LOT better now, no longer needing medication and overall making some really good lifestyle changes.\n\nAnyways, after finish up some stuff during the summer I'll be starting a \"self discovery\" phase. One of the things I'll do is travel around the world (gotta use those tendies), working on tech (i.e Digital Nomad) and as always monetizing autism.\n\nNow, as many of you know, Tinder is a very useful tool to meet new people, specially when traveling constantly and not really having the time to connect with a lot of people \"organically\". I really do not want hook ups but I figured I might as well make a proper tinder profile if I want people to want to know me.\n\nPlease suggest me any things that I should put on my Tinder Profile, any places I should go to or any life advice! \n\nTinder Profile Information:\n\n\u2022 1- 9 Pics\n\u2022 Tinder Bio\n\u2022 Current Work (So far I'm putting down Financial Trader in TD ((ya boi is not American and WealthSimple is not that great in Canada)))\n\u2022 School (shoutout DropOut gang)\n\u2022 My Anthem\n\u2022 Spotify Favorite Artists", "created_utc": 1553433301, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b4w7qt/college_dropout_traveling_and_tinder/", "is_self": true}
