Luckily Snap took a nose dive below $16 today. However when I wanted to exercise my option sell (buy?) I couldn\u2019t figure out how to do it and as the market got closer to closing Robinhood traded the contract. I still made some money but I feel like if I wasn\u2019t so retarded I could have made some decent tendies.  Why am I so retarded? How do I not fuck this up next time tendies are made?", "created_utc": 1569617835, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/da6g39/im_retarded_some_help_and_clarification_would_be/", "is_self": true}
