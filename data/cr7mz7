I have recently signed up for RH so I can play with some options but I feel like I need to learn more about the terminology and everything. I am very familair with the market and have my own strategies but I just don't know the very basics of the terminology involved.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf any of you could share some \"like I'm 5\" resources that would be awesome thanks", "created_utc": 1565968046, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cr7mz7/sources_for_options/", "is_self": true}
