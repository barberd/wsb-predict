They will stop the power rationing and we can make MASSIVE tendies. It's only $4 per share now and it's down 50&amp;#37; in 2 days. IDK if it counts as, \\\\\"insider knowledge,\\\\\" but my mom knows the lady in charge of important PG&amp;E contracts. She a great cook and makes awesome nuggets. But for reals tho. Her advise was to buy the crap out of calls right now. I'm conflicted cuz PG&amp;E can't do anything without lighting it on fire. ](https://preview.redd.it/kg08u35yldv31.png?width=643&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e269e2fb0091d1989184834dbd2d444e05c792fe)", "created_utc": 1572310281, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/doifxt/pge_will_moon_before_1122/", "is_self": true}
