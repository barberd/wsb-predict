I checked their website today and realized they were having a sale, bringing the price to $18. \n\nScared that the price difference would alter the space-time continuum and cause Elon Musk to create a CyberRocket, I promptly drove to Kohl to get a correction.\n\nI returned the shirt, only to discover that I was refunded $17.24. When I referenced the price on the receipt, the clerk told me that the receipt only showed the original price, and that I had also gotten a discount. \n\nPissed off at myself to not double-checking the price, I got in line to *buy* the shirt again. Upon leaving, I realized I had paid $**17.84,** a whole **60** cents more than what I originally paid. \n\nMy point is, I'm sure there's going to be a whole bucketload of autistic retards that can't read and do the same thing as me. 60 cents might not be much, but enough people do it, it can easily turn into 69 million, or even 420.\n\nLong $KSS.", "created_utc": 1574480715, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e0cjhn/buy_kohls_stonk_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
