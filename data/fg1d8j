Here's my acoustic DD on why each of these companies is a buy.\n\nRationale:  \n**BMY**  \nAll the DD was done by this fellow autist, worth the read:https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fefxrq/dd_on_bristolmyers_squibb_bmy/  \n*Decision: 17APR20 @ 65C*  \n  \n**DGX**  \nEveryone is going to be requesting to get tested for Coronavirus here in the coming weeks.  The media is running stories of high-profile old people contracting the virus -- boomers will flock to their centers to get tested.  DGX is one of the main companies manufacturing & shipping these tests.  Lots of hedgies are increasing their stake in DGX.  \nhttps://www.fool.com/investing/2020/03/05/major-medical-test-provider-to-bolster-us-covid-19.aspx  \n\"The FDA is making a highly unusual exception for Quest Diagnostics by allowing it to provide this service on a nationwide scale without subjecting its coronavirus test to the usual battery of tests. \"  \n*Decision: 17APR20 @ 120C*\n  \n**LH**  \nLH is the one of the other major players distributing coronavirus testing kits.  \n*Decision: 17APR20 @ 195C*   \n  \n**OXY**  \nOccidental Petroleum Corporation produces 658,000 barrels of oil per day.  If you've visited the Permian Basin in recent years, you know this production wont slow much at all.   \n*Decision: 18SEP20 @ 37.5C*  \n  \n**VIRT**  \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fg0hqd/virt_dd_big_brain_shit_is_about_to_moon/  \n*Decision: 17APR20 @30C*  \n  \n**USO**  \nSaudi Arabia's Aramco is now a publicly traded company. They are tanking the price of oil by flooding the market until a new deal is reached. Putin isn't a bitch, and Trump is the bigliest deal maker of all time.  USO will return to it's mean well before EOY.  Contracts are cheap as hell right now.  \n*Decision: 15JAN21 @ 11C (Leap)*", "created_utc": 1583786147.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fg1d8j/bull_plays_uso_oxy_virt_lh_dgx_bmy/", "is_self": true}
