{"id": "far24t", "title": "The Equalizer", "selftext": " I didnt like school much so i joined the military at 20. For 5 years I fucked around, hit fat rails, ate shrooms, dropped a lot of acid and had a lot of girls. I got out, got married, and hadnt been able to buy a home or have a kid, not because i didnt make decent money but because California is stupid expensive. \n\nFast forward to today. Im 28, im almost done with school, make about 4k a month after taxes. My wife and I are working on our first kid and now, thanks to this sub, we stand to make life changing money. Just like that we'll have capital to make real progress in our life, buy a house, pay whats left of our debts. \n\nThe playing field is getting leveled and its a beautiful thing. I wil sleep tight with my pockets full of boomer bucks. Robinhood, you truly live up to your name. Thank you all and i will see you in the AM for our morning bloodbath orgy.", "created_utc": 1582874759, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/far24t/the_equalizer/", "is_self": true}
