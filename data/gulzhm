{"id": "gulzhm", "title": "REZI - Severely Undervalued Security Industry Supplier w/ new Riot Tailwinds", "selftext": "Resideo Technologies Inc is a business spun-off from Honeywell, which also includes their home security offerings. The company continues to license to Honeywell brand name and is essentially a supplier for many (if not nearly all) home security companies. Their other products include home comfort products and other automation/internet of things offerings that integrate with other products like Alexa. The company also withdrew guidance for the year which has driven down the stock price. \n\nIn my personal experience, I also used to sell Honeywell equipment that is now a part of Resideo and there  is not only a lot trust in the Honeywell brand, but most people buy security based on fear and the desire to have \"peace-of-mind\". The same reasons gun sales are probably soaring is very likely driving up security sales which should lead to an undervalued supplier in the industry to soar as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Relevant Info:***\n\n* TTM Revenues: $4.951 billion\n* Market Cap: $837 million\n* Breakdown of Revenue Sources from 10-k (Page 80):\n   * ADI Global Distribution\\* - $2.813 billion\n   * Comfort - $1.103\n   * Security - $520 million\n   * Residential Thermal Solutions - $552 million\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLink: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/REZI/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/REZI/)\n\nLink: [http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001740332/5dec6c06-c71f-41dd-aa8f-beaed38e766d.pdf](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001740332/5dec6c06-c71f-41dd-aa8f-beaed38e766d.pdf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\**ADI* is the leading *global* wholesale *distributor* of security, AV and low-voltage products for licensed contractors.

Below is a small excerpt from their recent earnings call:\n\n\"For residential sales, we're seeing a reasonably resilient outcome through April and early May. As mentioned, we temporarily suspended some of our sales practices, but we're already beginning in certain markets to return to our traditional approaches. While we obviously see a lower number of leads, ***we've witnessed a significantly higher sales conversion rate, reflecting strong intent to buy security***.\"\n\nLink: [https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/05/09/adt-inc-adt-q1-2020-earnings-call-transcript.aspx](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/05/09/adt-inc-adt-q1-2020-earnings-call-transcript.aspx)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen looking at Resideo's recent earnings, their CFO details in their recent earnings how all business lines were down in the 1st quarter including security, but there was still strength in the resilience of their security business.\n\n\"The revenue decline in Q1 was driven by lower volumes across security, comfort and RTS... But we saw a reasonable sales tail off there. And on Security, I think we had saw the least sales tail off, but maybe that people take that more seriously, ***if there's an issue there or if they really want to enhance the security in their homes or their offices, they take that more seriously than Comfort and RTS***. And maybe that's why those sales held up a little bit more\"\n\nLink: [https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/05/10/resideo-technologies-inc-rezi-q1-2020-earnings-cal.aspx](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/05/10/resideo-technologies-inc-rezi-q1-2020-earnings-cal.aspx)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, as detailed in ADT's earnings with sales picking back up in April and May, the downstream effects of security companies ordering more equipment from suppliers should pick up in Q2. In addition, with the recent riots surrounding the George Floyd situation, small business may consider installing newer protective measures (besides guns), to provide greater \"peace of mind\" that people are looking for when they buy security.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nREZI should be trading at least a P/S of nearly .5 in my opinion based on the likely strength in their security cash flows. In addition, the company has had profitable quarters/years, so a profitable earnings call in the upcoming earnings call could send the stock soaring.", "created_utc": 1591023095.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gulzhm/rezi_severely_undervalued_security_industry/", "is_self": true}
