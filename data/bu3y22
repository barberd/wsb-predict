What is the greatest difference between 2001 AMZN and 2019 AMZN?\n\nA: The swoleness of the CEO\n\nWhat is the greatest difference between 2005 Facebook and 2019 Facebook?\n\nA: The swoleness of the CEO\n\nIs it really a coincidence that whenever you hear about a young genius CEO, they are nearly always described as \"skinny?\" Examples include Zuck, Shkreli, young Billy Gates, and countless others.\n\nBack when Bezos and Zucky were skinny mamas boys, these stocks were rockets. Now that they have been hitting the gym, these stocks are sluggish and weak. From this we conclude that stock performance is inversely related to the fitness level of the CEO.\n\n\"But why?\" I hear the tumultous masses asking, questioningly. The answer is simple and grounded in neurobiology and the endocrine system. A fat/skinny CEO has something to prove. They are an intellectual creature who merely eats to pacify and ignore the wants of the body, whose real drive is to do something in the realm of abstract thought.\n\nA fit CEO is an animal, hormone- based creature, who stays home from work if they are not feeling the animalistic drive(looking at you, Zuck), or who fucks around with married women on a private jet because they discovered that is a lot more fun that crunching numbers in a spreadsheet(looking at you, Mr. Bezos).\n\nWhenever you see a successful company CEO start lifting weights, it's time to sell your position. They have turned from philosopher to village chieftain sex demon. However, if they built the company and were fit from the start, that's perfectly fine, and only provides upside in case they cut down on gym hours to put in more hours at the company. Using this one technique, you can cut down on 15% of your losses, and double your upside, and stock anal-ists will hate you for it.", "created_utc": 1559069872, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bu3y22/market_factor_analysis_long_skinnyfat_ceos_short/", "is_self": true}
