The amount of open interest puts is crazy. It will probably tank which is fine. If it does, buy calls that are out until next quarter. HCA is a healthcare stock that is growing rapidly. \n\nHere in Kansas City it is consuming the market. Before HCA, Saint Luke's dominated the market here but now there is competition. Their hospitals and clinics are getting busier and busier every quarter. They are building more and more clinics and have a deal with CVS to promote CVS' pharmacy.\n\nWhile HCA is in debt, they don't care. They are taking one out of the CVS playbook and are buying out any competition then raising prices. CareSpots...bought out, now they're CareNow. Charging people $140 to just SEE the doctor. Anything else, is even more money. \n\nTheir Dallas Fort Worth locations are expanding and being revamped. Soon, they'll expand into a new market after they become partners with more cities to screen their employees.\n\nThey also offer employees all the overtime they want because they can't find enough people to fill the spots.  HCA will become an industry leader soon. HCA to 200 end of year. \n\nSorry I didn't post this sooner, was too busy getting fucked by China.", "created_utc": 1580163187, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/euvg8y/healthcare_autist_hca_next_big_thing/", "is_self": true}
