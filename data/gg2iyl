My GSX 5/15 $30p is up 58% today, my GSX 5/15 $35p up 25%, and my GSX 6/19 $25p is up 10%. But GSX is up 2.7%...\n\nHere's a thought: with Citron's newest tweet (https://twitter.com/CitronResearch/status/1258761120451407873?s=20), people expect GSX to drop come Monday, leading to an increased price in puts even though the stock itself went up. \n\nWhat do you all think?\n\nEDIT: It was the tweet! It was posted at 10:10am and GSX fell from 41.90 to 40.80 immediately afterwards. You can see the value of my put jumped up but then stayed there instead of dropping when GSX returned to 41.90ish: https://imgur.com/a/arNllfq", "created_utc": 1588974703.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gg2iyl/gsx_is_up_27_but_my_puts_are_up_20whats_going_on/", "is_self": true}
