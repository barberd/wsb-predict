{"id": "hchtfe", "title": "Weird Price Correlated Movements", "selftext": "I trade Bank of America options a lot. Today there was way more volume towards the calls than the puts yet the stock itself was going down up until around 2 pm. \n\nThen from 2-4pm almost the entire banking sector and DOW, SPY, QQQ, basically all trended up the rest of the day to 4pm. I watch a few other banking stocks at the same time and found the BAC $26, 6/26 Call was barely moving from .3 while other bank stocks call option, trading only a small fraction of the volume that BAC\u2019s call options were, were all gaining price fast relative to BAC Call options. \n\nI ended up deciding to go with Citigroup and bought C $53, 6/26 Call option at 2:24pm for 1.28 and then sold it at 3:16 for 1.51. That is almost an 18% rise. During the same period of time the BAC $26, 6/26 Call only went from like .32~.36 or about a 10% rise. I mean the thing I\u2019m confused about is that the BAC option vs. the Citigroup Option only rose about half( ~10% vs. ~20% ) than the C option.\n\nWhy did the BAC call option rise about only half the percent that the C option rose in the same time frames from ~2-3:30? Also like I said about the volume, the $26 BAC call option had volume of around 5,000 by 2pm while the C call option only had only maybe 300. \n\nAnd the price difference was basically ~.33 vs ~ 1.3, so it seems like the price of the BAC call option shouldve exploded when BAC\u2019s stock price rose vs C stock price rising at a similar rate correlation. \n\nit\u2019s really confusing me why the BAC call didn\u2019t rise as much percentage as the C call option, and I would\u2019ve guessed based on the volume that the BAC option would actually go higher percentage but yea it did only about half.", "created_utc": 1592638136.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hchtfe/weird_price_correlated_movements/", "is_self": true}
