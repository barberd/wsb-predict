Maybe they make a profit this Quarter.\n\nI saw someone make a post about OPk last week and it was met with a lot of hatred. I am curious, for those of you that have been tested for Covid, did you get tested by bio reference? I read their investor presentation and it indicated that they could test 50k people a day for Covid and 400k people per day for antibodies. Presentation can be found via google: OPK investor presentation.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m looking to buy OPK 2022 2.00c, talk me off the ledge or I\u2019m doing it tomorrow.\n\nI also saw someone posted that in Florida alone OPk has performed nearly 250k tests. Seems like maybe they might make a profit this quarter.", "created_utc": 1593496331.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hihdpt/is_opk_a_dud_or_is_bio_reference_their_saving/", "is_self": true}
