Last Monday, high yield (junk bond) oil companies were essentially given a death sentence within the next 6 months. \n\nWhy? Non integrated (not XOM or CVX) can't roll their debt over because no one in their right mind is going to lend to them. Worse yet, since 2014 a good amount of money in oil is private equity money, which naturally leveraged up to get a greater return.\n\nBecause these PEs are so leveraged, contagion is spreading into other lower grade companies who can't easily access the credit markets. This includes a large portion of Russell 2000 small caps.\n\nFor example, small manufacturers can't get the raw materials in from China, and can't create value if there is a quarantine because employees can't work from home. No cash flow = can't service debt, plus the new problem of not being able to roll over debt.\n\nYou can give a bank money and persuade them to lend, but as we have seen from TARP, you can't make them because no bank is willing to take on more credit risk with a recession on the horizon.\n\nCredit spreads all the way to BBB have exploded these last two days, much more than during the coronavirus declines the weeks prior. Everyone waiting for the corporate debt bubble to pop, this is the start.", "created_utc": 1583967448.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fh65bu/its_beginning_to_be_a_credit_crisis/", "is_self": true}
