{"id": "eafvrw", "title": "SHOP and ROKU", "selftext": "After getting dildo fucked by SHOP and losing 10k on SHOP puts today, I decided to actually do some research on this shit meme stock. Who the FUCK is buying this retarded ass stock and other shit meme stocks like ROKU which swing randomly every fucking day.\n\nWell it turns out they're institutional stocks. What this mean is gay ass big boy institutional investment firms like Fidelity and Vanguard and those cunts buy these stocks as growth stocks. When they get more money from retail investors to invest, they buy more and more of these stocks to add to their portfolio. When retail investors want to withdraw money from the funds, the fund managers liquidate these stocks. Well it turns out ROKU and SHOP are both in the portfolios of many of the same investment funds. https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ROKU/holders/ https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SHOP/holders/\n\nSo I ran a regression on SHOP closing prices and ROKU closing prices for the past year. And this was the result https://gyazo.com/42ae6f202ed78d14e5031d68a8c3d493\n\nHere's a graph of the two stocks. https://gyazo.com/3d6d5355df2a793e8caffbe0569fe084\n\nWhat does this mean? It means SHOP and ROKU are meme stocks that are traded almost hand in hand with each other. When one moves up, the other moves up, when one moves down, the other moves down. It has a R-Square value of 0.85, which is a high correlation of the two stocks. SHOP has been going up all week, whereas ROKU has been going down this past week. I only took middle school statistics so I have no idea what I'm saying, but maybe buy some ROKU calls or SHOP puts on Monday extended 2 weeks out. ROKU will either be rebounding or SHOP will be dropping.\n\nTLDR: Buy ROKU calls 2 weeks out or SHOP puts 2 weeks out. I've only taken middle school math so take this investment advice with caution. I may actually just be a fully blown autistic retard. Thanks", "created_utc": 1576301829, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eafvrw/shop_and_roku/", "is_self": true}
