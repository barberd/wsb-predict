There isn't going to be a recession anytime soon in the USA.  Capital is heading to the USA because companies are still doing well.  I think we might be looking at a 1997-1998 scenario with China being the dead dog though.  Hong Kong is about to implode.  This would be like the Asian financial crisis part 2.  US markets did well going into 2000 with the US dollar index going bonkers.  Europe is garbage now.  China is about to hit the skids.  Global bonds are all prices to perfection.  This is a recipe for US stock appreciation.", "created_utc": 1564629814, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ckiv3k/us_dollar_index_went_up_a_lot_capital_flowing/", "is_self": true}
