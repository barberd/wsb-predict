(STZ), a leading beverage alcohol company, today provided a response including fact-based consumer trends to address unfounded concerns about the impact of the COVID-19 virus on its business and consumer sentiment related to the company\u2019s Corona beer brand.\n\nBased on recent IRI retail trends, sales of Corona Extra remain strong, with dollar sales up 5% in the U.S. per the latest 4-week period ended Feb. 16, nearly doubling the 52-week trend for the brand. Similarly, depletion trends for Corona Extra for the first two months of this calendar year through Feb. 26, as well as the month of February, have also outpaced their 52-week trend. In addition, IRI dollar sales trends for the entire Corona brand family are also outpacing their 52-week trend in the latest 4-week and 12-week periods. Furthermore, all business units supporting our beer business are seeing positive sales trends for the brand thus far this calendar year.\n\n\u201cOur thoughts and prayers go out to those affected by this terrible virus and we hope efforts to more fully contain it gain traction soon,\u201d said Bill Newlands, president and chief executive officer at Constellation Brands.  \u201cIt\u2019s extremely unfortunate that recent misinformation about the impact of this virus on our business has been circulating in traditional and social media without further investigation or validation. These claims simply do not reflect our business performance and consumer sentiment, which includes feedback from our distributor and retailer partners across the country. We\u2019ve seen no impact to our people, facilities or operations and our business continues to perform very well. Unlike many of our competitors, sales of our beer brands are focused almost entirely on the U.S. market. Our company does not have much exposure to international markets such as China that have been most impacted by this situation. I\u2019m extremely proud of the efforts of our team. We\u2019ve built good momentum as we gear up for the upcoming summer selling season.\u201d\n\nABOUT CONSTELLATION BRANDS\nAt Constellation Brands, our mission is to build brands that people love because we believe sharing a toast, unwinding after a day, celebrating milestones, and helping people connect, are Worth Reaching For.
