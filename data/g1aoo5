And it doesn\u2019t help that the dumbass\u2019s on this sub will post stuff like \u201c I am in Trumps reopening task force\u201d. If you wanna get arrested, be my guest. At least let people see the warning and monitor their behavior because this sub is for sure under investigation. If you look at the data, the second after a retard comes on here and makes a recommendation, middle schoolers and bots alike both take it and run with it. With that logic it\u2019s very easy to run undetectable p&d schemes. I get its against the rules but it happens. Just don\u2019t post shit you\u2019ll regret cause you don\u2019t wanna be getting piped in prison for white collar crimes on Reddit.", "created_utc": 1586888006.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1aoo5/yall_removed_my_warning_sec_bloomberg_mistake_by/", "is_self": true}
