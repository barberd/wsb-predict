{"id": "f8mpa2", "title": "I'm coming out of the closet.", "selftext": "I've had my bull hat on for years, even pushing back against the hordes of gays on wsb over the weekend... But the time has come. I'm ready to go \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b. Here's my grounded rationale;\n\nThe Chinese supply chain is obliterated. I have an ecommerce business that relies heavily on China for its supply. I'm good for another month, may be two, but after that I'm screwed. But here is where it gets scary: I am one of the last one standing in my niche. All my competitors around the world have either run out or are days away from running out of ALL their products.\n\nHere is where it gets even scarier: I and my competitors are only sort of middle-of-the-chain. The businesses that depend on my industry being around are also screwed, they get all their supplies either from me, my competitors, or in the very rare case of high volume movers, direct from China. That supply chain is FUCKED.\n\nIt's more of the same in all the other micro-small businesses that rely on China to supply them. Vape shop shelves are empty. Dollarama, Dollar Tree, all the mom and pop dollar stores; FUCKED.\n\n&gt;90% of small eommerce businesses with physical inventory and other small electronics physical stores are going to be out of inventory, they're all fucked.\n\nThe owners of these micro and small businesses makes up a solid chunk of the population with incomes between $100k - $1 million. That's a LOT of disposable income that is going to disappear and be unable to buy an iPhone or the likes even if those were available, which means even the big businesses are going to suffer, even if their supply chains aren't in China.\n\nNow there's rumors of factories opening up again and commerce starting up again. That's true. Except workers are reluctant to go to work, only the ones desperate for money are going back and the ones that do go back WILL at some point catch the virus. This is first hand information directly from the suppliers I personally know. These people do not want to be out there, and there's good reason for that.\n\nNow obviously these effects won't be seen till earnings for Q1 2020 start to come out. So my play is far out. I'm keeping my long positions open as they're all dated for 04/17 and later just in case there is a recovery or at the very least a slight move up, but I'm hedging the downside with 50% of my portfolio depending on the WHO announcement tomorrow morning. \n\nAll hail the gay bear general.\n\nTL:DR, September puts for SPY $300", "created_utc": 1582523065, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f8mpa2/im_coming_out_of_the_closet/", "is_self": true}
