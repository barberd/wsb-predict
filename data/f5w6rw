{"id": "f5w6rw", "title": "Dish Network - 2/19/2020 BMO (Bearish)", "selftext": " \n\n**Stock: DISH Networks (DISH)**\n\n**Direction:** **Neutral Bearish**\n\n**Price Target:** **40$**\n\n**Type:** Call Credit Spread\n\n**Fundamental:** Dish is currently in transition to a wireless play from their traditional hardware cable business. While its current in a downtrend, long term debt is high compared to cash on hand. In addition, DISH requires a massive 10-15 Billion worth of cash to complete its 5G dreams. While they can generate funding through banks and potential partnerships with large tech companies, it is still a very uphill battle.\n\n**Technical**: Priced above in 20, 50, 200 day moving average, with visible lower volume since last earnings; a spike in volume during the Sprint + Tmobile merger announcement. MACD shows bearish divergence. RSI shows around 75, overbought. Options sentiments are very bearish in volume and bearish in open interest. Implied movement of about 8.9% or 3.61$.\n\n**Sentimental**: Dish has been on a decline due to the rising popularity of streaming. However, with the merger of Sprint and TMUS, Dish is positioning themselves to become a 5G leader with their telecom towers and proposed new investments. This can optically revitalize the company\u2019s image, but the logistics and capital requirements are very high and not clear enough.\n\n**ROI: 23%**\n\n**Risk Level: 3 out of 5, Risky**\n\n**Sell: 2/28 44$ Call, Buy 2/28 45$ Call**  \nThe crux of this play is based on technical and option volume/OI sentiments. Due to the recent optimism surrounding Dish's upcoming role in the telecom space, especially due to their spectrum assets, DISH stock has jumped to the 40$ range. However, short term realities will weigh heavily on DISH in this transition period and will require DISH to show process in its ambitious 5G plans.\n\nThe wildcard would be additional updates on progress of their 5G transition. This would have a bullish and unpredictable affect on the stock price.", "created_utc": 1582050207, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f5w6rw/dish_network_2192020_bmo_bearish/", "is_self": true}
