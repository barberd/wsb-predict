The stock has taken a beating because of Covid19 & movie theater closures.\n\nInvestors think Cineworld's C$34/share buyout offer will be cancelled, yet Reuter's reported, \"Cineworld Says No Change In Co's Position On Cineplex Takeover Since March\" on April 7. That's double your money at C$11.69 (at post) if it goes through.\n\nInvestors also think Cineplex will cancel their monthly $0.15 per share dividend in their next ER that they delayed until June 29, 2020.\n\nInvestors are discounting Cineplex's possible rise of online movie rentals to offset their onsite losses.\n\nThe odds don't get better than this but do your Due Diligence before investing.\n\n52 Week Range: C$6.30 - C$34.39\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[CGX Stock Performance](https://preview.redd.it/rwgnvzs486051.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=08dbd99e27456108bb33073a24af63a1a8f36821)\n\n\\---------------------------------------------\n\n**Cineplex Inc.**, formerly known as Cineplex Galaxy Income Fund and Galaxy Entertainment Inc. is a Canadian entertainment company headquartered in Toronto, Ontario.
