Here's what they're not saying: the prop up isn't just the Fed with the unlimited printer to banking institutions, buying ETFs, and backing every loan in the states... it's also the MMs along with exchanges themselves through direct price manipulation intervention. Yeah, I said it. The markets refuse to let this thing go down, and it's not because Jpow's printer makes MSFT go higher, it's because the people who dictate pricing have put parameters in place that limit the downside, artificially inflate bid and ask ratios, volume, all that, to give the illusion of up days when fundamentals, market sentiment, are all down.\n\nThe market is supposed to have its ups and downs, and when we disallow the downs and punt them into the future, the market becomes fake and unstable. Jpow's printer makes the bulls feel good right now, but he's putting them through a castration machine, they just don't know it because the illusion shows them in a massive field with all these hot cows they think they're about to fuck. This up day is very fucking ominous. Might wanna put gloves on those diamond hands and always be ready for the systemic cliff fall, because this is bad.", "created_utc": 1585831743.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ftlr3g/if_theres_anyone_who_doubts_the_extent_to_which/", "is_self": true}
