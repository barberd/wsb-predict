{"id": "fwnq7j", "title": "I've switched to puts.", "selftext": "FACT:  The S&P hit its current low on 03/23/20.\n\nALLEGED FACT:  [Using the RSI, the S&P retests its lows 28 days later (median)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/canaccords-dwyer-expects-market-retest-221658700.html)\n\nFACT:  28 days after 03/23/20 is 4/20/20.  FOUR-TWENTY!  It's destiny!!\n\nFACT:  2,792 is a 50% retracement level.  I'm not saying retracement working is a fact.  I'm saying 2,792 is the 50% retracement level.\n\nWe're basically at 2,792 now so it seems like a great time to switch to puts expecting a retest of 220 on or around 4/20/20.  So what do we buy?\n\nWell, we don't want theta decaying us in the ass so when we sell these puts since we're not holding to expiration, we want 30-45 DTE.  45 days from 04/20/20 is 06/04/20.  That means 06/19/20 expiration or 06/30/20 expiration.  \n\nPersonally, I'm taking the 06/30/20 because I want extra time for this to happen just in case the market isn't so easy that some random guy can make money this easily.\n\n**CONCLUSION:**. 240p 6/30 with the intention of selling once SPY hits 220 or maybe 228 because the retest would come within 4%.    I could do a 230p but I'm worried full retest won't happen because of Powell doing Powell things so I want my strike closer to being ITM right now.\n\nThey're selling for ~$9.00 each now and I'm hoping to sell ~$27.00.\n\nA sudden test of the low may help drive IV back up so the time premium when I sell could be higher than it is now even though the VIX is pretty high already lol\n\n**EDIT:**  The market is forward looking.  Right now, the next thing is \"The virus has peaked and we can start thinking about when the economy opens again\".  But on 4/20, that will be old news and the next thing will be \"The virus has peaked and started opening the economy and this place is not going to open overnight\"", "created_utc": 1586277588.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fwnq7j/ive_switched_to_puts/", "is_self": true}
