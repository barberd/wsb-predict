{"id": "e0p88f", "title": "Another Hunch", "selftext": "Anyone that has been following the HP XEROX shit show might have the same feelings as me. HP continues to flirt with a 20 dollar stock price and I think people are hesitant to buy in to the possibility that Xerox buys them out. I personally think this will 100% happen, Xerox is in hot pursuit and has HP is a pretty sticky situation.\n\nMy hunch is that HP will announce the acquisition of it's company on their ER on the 26th. I was thinking we might see a response this weekend, so there is still time, but I think they will go forward with it on ER day. \n\nIn my opinion, this is an only win situation unless by for some absolutely ridiculous reason HP sticks to their guns and denies the bid. But I think there are two scenarios that will most likely occur. HP will miss on ER and announce the Xerox buyout, pretty much saving any shorts. OR HP beats ER and the stock pushes to 22-23 but there is still the issue of addressing the Xerox bid, they can't escape it, and according to Xerox, HP shareholders will benefit from the buyout, pushing the stock maybe even to 24-25 if they beat and they agree to the acquisition. \n\nEither way, I don't think HP will holdout, I think this thing gets announced this week and I think it's a definite win for call buyers. I've also been seeing much more OI and Volume leading up to this week in HP calls. So do with this opinion what you will, but I'm buying in now while shits cheap.", "created_utc": 1574547965, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e0p88f/another_hunch/", "is_self": true}
