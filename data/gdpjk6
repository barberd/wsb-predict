See for yourself:**\n\n* [https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2010/34-61595.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2010/34-61595.pdf)\n\n**I know you lazy fucks aren't going to read that, so let me summarize:**\n\n* If a security drops more than 10% in a day, a short sale circuit breaker is triggered\n* The breaker lasts 2 days (current day through end of \"next-day\" trading session)\n* The rule gives priority to long sellers and imposes an uptick rule on additional short sales\n* An uptick rule means that to sell short, your \"ask\" must be at least 1 tick higher than the current \"national best bid\"\n\n**Here's a quote directly from the SEC document:**\n\n*\"We believe it is appropriate at this time to adopt a short sale-related circuit breaker because, when triggered, it will prevent short selling, including potentially manipulative or abusive short selling,   from driving down further the price of a security that has already experienced a significant intraday price decline, and will facilitate the ability of long sellers to sell first upon such a decline.\"*\n\n**Why is this important?**\n\n* Because price can't be driven down further for at least 2 days\n* This usually leads to a rebound / reversal rally\n\n**Let's take a look at what happened to Tesla**\n\n* Tesla triggered the circuit breaker at 11:39 on Friday\n\n*Proof:*  [https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/dynamic/symdir/shorthalts/shorthalts20200504.txt](https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/dynamic/symdir/shorthalts/shorthalts20200504.txt)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6acn6f7mwuw41.png?width=413&format=png&auto=webp&s=33183220d4518cac36c60c1ed16365b0f01c3dfa\n\n**What was the price at 11:38?**\n\n* Approximately 700\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ongs8yv7xuw41.png?width=610&format=png&auto=webp&s=086624c2c85a6c52638cce3700b607c47bda714e\n\n**Now let's take a look at what happened the rest of the day:**\n\n* Notice how it struggled to stay below that amount\n* For put holders, always look to exit within the next 10-20 minutes after this triggers\n   * This will likely be your \"max profit\"\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ifx5d9ylxuw41.png?width=556&format=png&auto=webp&s=c35d86719342773c0ea3093fc93db25022d95a33\n\n**Now what happened today?**\n\n* Tesla mooned to 769... 10% gain\n* Without any downward pressure, the rebound easily gained momentum and continued throughout the day\n\n**Before you criticize me.. I'm fully aware that there are other rules / regulations that also play a role.. I just wanted to point out one of the reasons why Tesla mooned today..**\n\nIf you want to beat the exchange, you need to understand every rule... inside and out", "created_utc": 1588646120.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gdpjk6/tsla_mooned_today_because_short_selling_was_banned/", "is_self": true}
