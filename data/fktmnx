Examples are Carnival cruises right now, their market cap is half their debt on the balance sheet. GE's market cap is just slightly below their debt. This is a common theme for so many of the largest companies right now.  \n\n\nWhen this has happened in past recessions, do banks take over these companies? Do they give these companies time to recover and provide some type of loan forgiveness?
