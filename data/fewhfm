Not even close", "selftext": "There are currently 340 confirmed cases in the US (likely more because limited testing). \n\nThe number of infections doubles ever ~5 days. By first week of May, we are looking at +1M cases in the US alone. \n\nThe US is not a dictatorship like China and the Americans are not obedient to Gov bullshit. This will make it impossible to contain the bat virus like China did. \n\nThe US healthcare system is also not fit for purpose. It\u2019s a profit maximising industry that works great for individual people that have some super rare hereditary disease requiring a $5M shot of a recently developed gene therapy or state of the art cancer treatment.\n\nBut it\u2019s absolute trash in dealing with mass outbreaks. Unless the government comes out and guarantees 100% of medical bills related to the bat virus and starts building ICUs like China did, this shit is going to spread like wildfire, doubling the number of infections every 5 days. Even if people on great health insurance get treatment, they can get reinfected almost immediately if exposed to the virus again. \n\nAnd guess what, the vaccine (which is at least 9-12months away) will have to be rolled out country wide, for FREE for it to have any chance to work. If they start charging for it, you can forget about stopping this virus. Free &amp; US healthcare don\u2019t go hand-in-hand \n\nTLDR: buy puts SPY 250 by May", "created_utc": 1583594507, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fewhfm/we_havent_hit_the_bottom_yet_not_even_close/", "is_self": true}
