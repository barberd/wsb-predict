{"id": "f7voun", "title": "$GE - Outlook for 2020 - Discussion", "selftext": "GE is a boomer stock. I did not think there was a future after their dip below $10, but it seems they are poised for a comeback.\n\n**Pros**\n\n* Power Generation. As green energy becomes the norm, their wind turbines and solar market will gain traction. They have a smaller foothold in hydro, steam, and nuclear as well. Overall, their power division accounts for around 18% of revenue for GE. This is slow and steady growth.\n* Aviation. They have a growing jet engine division with some lucrative prospects. Approved for exporting of the Leap-1C engine to China. In talks with Airbus, who may ditch Rolls Royce for the more fuel efficient and less costly GE turbine for the A330. Boeing caused GE to bleed cash with the grounding of the 737 MAX, but the new CEO, Larry Culp, is working some magic for a strong second half of 2020.\n\n**Cons**\n\n* They have a lot of debt. Not as bad as it once was, but it is still an issue. They ended 2018 with $55 billion in debt. Even with $20 billion in liquidation of their healthcare division, they have a considerable amount on their books. Again, this is slowly being reduced, but it is the elephant in the room.\n* Corona Virus' impact on cash flow. Larry Culp is anticipating negative $2 billion for the first quarter. While they also expect a snap back, who knows with this bullshit virus. They have operations around the world so we're stuck waiting to see how big of a hit their supply chain takes.\n\n**TL;DR** \\- I think GE is going to have a good run over the next few years. It is cheap now, so buy calls.\n\nI don't know what I am doing or what I am talking about, but have decided to YOLO my whopping $1500 RH account into 50 $13 calls for 4/17.\n\nProof of position:  [https://imgur.com/gallery/NTlKHg8](https://imgur.com/gallery/NTlKHg8) \n\n**Am I just plain stupid?**", "created_utc": 1582392677, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7voun/ge_outlook_for_2020_discussion/", "is_self": true}
