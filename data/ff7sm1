Currently it's at 2.32$. **Their all time highest reached at 17.68$ in 2015-2016 from approval of the ZIKA virus news**. They have history of approval with CDC.\n\n* I believe there's a possibility for a small growth this upcoming week if everything goes well with OPK and still a bit early to get in as the price dropped on Friday, which I bought in at 2.60$, but I believe this will not trend downwards this coming up week.\n\n* Let me know on your thoughts \n\nMy Positions:\n\nShort Term for next week news - OPK 3$ call 03/13\n\nMid term to play it safe - OPK 3$ call 04/03", "created_utc": 1583643511, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ff7sm1/opk_big_news_next_week_if_everything_goes_right/", "is_self": true}
