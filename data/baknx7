Although it has risen quite a bit recently so not sure what the effect will be on SP. Also keep in mind it's most likely gonna be based on AMD IP, not 100% but pretty good chances. I'd say 90% chance.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is tesla being tesla it could hype up AMD quite a bit even if the revenue from that IP is quite small. Self-driving being super hyped right now + tesla being the most hyped in the category. But who knows. If you're looking for a YOLO look into it. And I don't think this is fully priced in yet.", "created_utc": 1554668564, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/baknx7/theres_probably_a_play_to_be_made_with_tslas_new/", "is_self": true}
