But you live and learn. And hopefully, do better mistakes next time. \n\nFed has kicked the problem down the road not solved it. Fed bought us time until we have a vaccine now if the vaccine comes in the next 3-4 months we will be fine otherwise we will go through all the motion of recession if the vaccine take 18 months as predicted by many (Bill Gates, Former FDA). \n\nThis also align well with the November election cycle, Trump can keep the market propped up until ducks come home to roost. \n\nSo why is the market going up?\n\nWithout Fed intervention, we were assuming all of these companies are going to file bankruptcies next month, now that overhang is removed there is sense of relief and sugar high (fed printing high). \n\nLook at the biggest rallies all of these companies were assumed to be going bankrupt next month now they have liquidity problems solved for the next 6-9 months. \n\nAll the quality stocks like AAPL were laggards in this rally compare to this overleveraged garbage. \n\nHere is a relevant video \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qoaTItTsfM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qoaTItTsfM)\n\nI fully believe what the Fed did was the right thing to do (maybe not for bears, including me) \n\nHere is a great comment explaining what the Fed did and its effects \n\n[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22827276](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22827276)\n\nI am not the one for market prediction since it's nearly impossible but mostly likely it trade sideways with good amount of volatility and overshoot to both upside and downside (SPY 240 - 300) until we see really economic fallout or vaccine which overcome first.", "created_utc": 1586484706.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fy60yt/fed_delayed_not_solved_the_problem/", "is_self": true}
