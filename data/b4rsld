{"id": "b4rsld", "title": "LEVI DD", "selftext": "Levi is the most disrespected and ignored ticker in this subreddit at the moment. It could easily double or triple within this year. It has an 8.5 billion valuation while GOOS has 5b, and American Eagle has like 3b, just for frame of reference.  Levi is the de-facto Jean company in the world. No one wears jeans, you wear Levi\u2019s. \n\nSo why is it being ignored by some of the smarter people on this sub? What\u2019s wrong with the stock besides the fact it went up 30% on its first day? It\u2019s not like Snapchat, it actually sells tangible products at a profit, and has existed for like 100 years I think. \n\nThis stock is an easy double/triple bagger at $40-$60. Can someone PLEASE tell me why I shouldn\u2019t throw my fucking life savings at this company?", "created_utc": 1553397121, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b4rsld/levi_dd/", "is_self": true}
