Own a business whose products you\u2019ll never afford", "selftext": "I almost didn\u2019t want to post anything here for you retards coz you\u2019d leverage your mum\u2019s IRA all because you fucking cucks believe it \u201cliterally can\u2019t go tits up\u201d well guess what retard, you\u2019ve lost your life savings and you\u2019re paying for your wife\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s condoms. Cheers.\n\nYou probably haven\u2019t heard of FTCH (with your bank account in overdraft can you even afford to use it?) but it\u2019s a luxury retail site used by those that know how to make their money AND KEEP IT (you guessed that right, your wife\u2019s boyfriend) to buy the best apparel that money can buy. Think LV, Prada, Gucci, and other shit you\u2019ll never be able to afford in your shitty lives. Now, for some DD coz even though I insult you cucks this much I want you to make shitloads of tendies:\n\nWhy FTCH?\n\nDon\u2019t expect to return to any semblance of a \u201cnormal life\u201d for a long time to come. The second wave of Covid infections has not even fully begun yet. This means that e-commerce has not even reached the full extent of the potential that it has. Yes, you read that right. AMZN will still grow, not necessarily in the next month, or even the next 3 months, but to buy and hold AMZN for the long-term is most definitely a winning investment. But how do we make the kind of stellar 200% gains that there is simply no chance of AMZN ever replicating, now that it has reached Phase 3 of its growth? (if you don\u2019t get what Phase 3 means, read this: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2018/01/11/business-life-cycle-spectrum-where-are-you/#25ee744def5e](https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2018/01/11/business-life-cycle-spectrum-where-are-you/#25ee744def5e)) FTCH is one such company.\n\nSome stats on the luxury retail industry:\n\n1. sales have risen at a 5% compounded annual growth rate since 2008\n\nlimited e-retail penetration at just 12%, compared to [30%+ for the broader apparel category](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/farfetch-stock-could-run-way-181010780.html#).\n\n1. Farfetch owns about 5% of the global luxury fashion e-retail market today, up from about [2% in 2016](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/farfetch-stock-could-run-way-181010780.html#). The biggest e-commerce players in the world own about [10% of the market](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/farfetch-stock-could-run-way-181010780.html#)\n\nUltimately, you want to get in on companies that have a solid business model, have demonstrated growth potential, and have demonstrated A NEED FOR THEIR PRODUCT. I cannot stress how important this is. I don\u2019t give a shit if a company\u2019s financials look amazing with net positive Free Cash Flow and EBITDA year-on-year. If they do not have a product that people will always need/want (think Google, Apple, Cybersecurity, Consumer essentials), the company is going to die. Period.\n\nDue to the huge scope of this company and the niche clientele it serves, it has an amazing chance at making more money than ever, since lesser consumers would be willing to go out for the next few months - people who don't spend money on your wife\u2019s boyfriends\u2019 cuck parties. It is for the ultra rich.\n\nOh, did I mention? FTCH is 35.7% owned by insiders. Why is this good for you, the shareholder/options trader? Your interests are aligned with the leaders of the company. In words you'll understand: tendies many many.\n\nObviously buy options because the risk/reward ratio is so much more worthwhile than shares.\n\n**NOTE: Do not buy the July calls unless you want to get fucked by theta decay. Or do, and post your loss porn here. Can\u2019t wait.**\n\nTl;dr\n\nFTCH 10/16 22c\n\nFurther reading though I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re not even gonna bother reading:\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/farfetch-stock-could-run-way-181010780.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/farfetch-stock-could-run-way-181010780.html)", "created_utc": 1592402905.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/harth7/buy_ftch_you_cucks_own_a_business_whose_products/", "is_self": true}
