{"id": "g15k70", "title": "Clorox Earnings Will Be Huge", "selftext": "Clorox is killing it in this economy, being an industry leader in CLEANING PRODUCTS during a PANDEMIC. They also sell a vast number of other products that people use every day. Their stock value has risen notably while most other stocks have dropped hard. Their earnings report is on 05/01, where they're sure to report an impressive increase in sales. We've now seen what happens when companies report huge losses for this quarter (looking at you JP Morgan) and it somehow is good. Printer goes BRRRRR. Imagine what a fucking juggernaut like Clorox is going to look like after they report their earnings. The best part is, they were turning their brand around BEFORE all of this started.\n\nCLX 192.50C 05/08", "created_utc": 1586871057.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g15k70/clorox_earnings_will_be_huge/", "is_self": true}
