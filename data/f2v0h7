The WSB youtube clip from 2018 shows clicking multiple options, but when I do that on RH site it says I can only purchase one option at a time. If I simply buy a call and try to sell a call, it forces me to own the underlying security.\n\nThanks for the noob help :)", "created_utc": 1581529705, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f2v0h7/bull_call_spread_on_rh_wont_let_me_buy_multiple/", "is_self": true}
