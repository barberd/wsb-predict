{"id": "gczz67", "title": "Intermediate Outlook on the Natural Gas (NG) Market", "selftext": "So the futures market just opened up minutes ago, and [Natural Gas futures opened up over 3%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/ngm20). I think this commodity market is looking very bullish the next few months heading into the summer, and I will explain why. Natural Gas futures are mostly energy complex supply/demand affected, meaning that if you pay attention to the news in the market for the commodity as well as the analysts that make predictions, you can anticipate price movements with some level of predictability (not fool proof). Last week, the EIA released its usual Thursday [Natural Gas Storage report](http://ir.eia.gov/ngs/ngs.html), showing a build of 70 billion cubic feet (bcf). This was bearish sentiment, which resulted in NG futures prices declining as a result (just to give an idea how the markets react to news). The build was above expected, indicating that producers have not shut in the supply increases as much as anticipated, following months long of demand destruction on the LNG (liquid natural gas) markets.\n\nHowever, this last Friday, a report from the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rising-natural-gas-prices-are-a-hot-bet-11588339279) indicated for the first time in about a year, a bullish indicator for the NG futures market. Speculative positions for the commodity were net long (buy-side; bullish) for NG, meaning that the majority of open interest in the NG market was anticipating increases in NG prices. This has been largely driven by the increased expectations for additional/larger shut-ins by NG producers, which will tighten supply for the commodity and drive up prices. Of course, many may be asking \"but since energy market demand is so low (i.e. negative oil prices); won't NG continue to suffer from the demand destruction it has been experiencing?\" While it is true that natural gas demand is very low, it has historically been more stable than WTI demand, and it is already very close to it's 25 year low of $1.552/mmbtu (selling pressure has decreased the last two months significantly). It is likely that supply-side indicators (i.e. shut-ins by producers) will have a greater impact on NG prices in the intermediate to long-term. Shares of Range Resources, EQT, and CNX have all almost doubled since February.\n\nSo while the short-term price outlook for [Natural Gas looks grim](https://www.naturalgasintel.com/articles/121859-natural-gas-forwards-highlight-continued-battle-between-supplydemand), if you have some patience, the market presents a unique opportunity to capture so price appreciation due to supply chain indicators in the NG market. If you are involved in the futures market, it is hard to anticipate price action on NG for the next couple weeks (it has been very volatile as of late); but taking a long position with a 3-6 month outlook may turn out to be very lucrative. Of course if you are not trading futures, individual nat. gas producers like the ones mentioned above are always an options (although the results of shut ins may already be priced into these), and there is the ETF UNG which is similar to USO in that it holds 80% of its funds in the front month Natural Gas futures contract (an indirect way to invest in the nat. gas futures market).\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not long or short any position in the Natural Gas market currently, however I am actively examining the market for the commodity for an entry point.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR UNG Calls or Put Credit Spread (or naked Puts for those risk loving autists) for the options players. For those that have a futures trading account, Buy-side NGN20 or NGQ20, or call options on NGN20 or a put spread on NGN20 (both have decent open interest, so they are fairly liquid).", "created_utc": 1588546243.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gczz67/intermediate_outlook_on_the_natural_gas_ng_market/", "is_self": true}
