But cash sitting in a bank account looks boring.\n\nThere's always going to be an advantage to looking at things throughout the day to take advantage of trends and shifts of direction, but obviously some plays are probably to burn up everything if you're not keeping a close eye on things vs. others.\n\nMy thoughts on low time commitment stabler plays:\n\n\\- Plays into ERs a month or two out to take advantage of IV increase to balance out time decay. I like the thought of doing this in particular on recent steep drops that were growth stocks like OLLI and ULTA since I think they have a good chance of bouncing back and I could probably get away with just calls vs. straddles and get out sometime ahead of the ER.\n\n\\- 3 mo/6 mo/LEAPS, with maybe checks beginning/end of each day for potential securing any quicker profits and shifting things around. Barring shit like a popular CEO dying in a fire, shifts wouldn't be so major that I'd have to keep a close eye on things I think.\n\n\\- Safe-ish sells rather than buys - maybe longer term wheel strategy on stable companies I'm generally bullish on, and avoid holding through ERs to avoid risky situations.\n\nI feel like between these, gains can still be well above the lame annual 8% /r/investing would settle for while not needing to pay attention to Orange Tweet Man or news other than beginning/end of each day.\n\nAnyone use these sorts of strategies with low time dedication and if so, how's it worked out?", "created_utc": 1568230639, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d2vo5e/low_time_involvement_stable_growth_strategies/", "is_self": true}
