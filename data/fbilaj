I'm not saying go out and buy a bunch of shit Treasury bonds that are barely going to earn you any money.  I'm saying go out and buy Treasury calls because the implied low volatility makes them cheap as chips.  Every boomer is out there dumping their stocks and are buying them up as we speak.  $GOVT 6/19 $27 calls are only 50 cents right and are on pace to hit the money by Tuesday.  I'm currently up +314% on calls purchased earlier this week and I have until June to ride this train to the top.

Investors tend to shy away from credit risks, such as corporate bonds (especially high-yield bonds) and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) since these investments have higher default rates than government securities.\n\nAs the economy weakens, businesses have a more difficult time generating revenue and profits, which can make debt repayment difficult and, in the worst-case scenario, lead to bankruptcy.\n\nAs investors sell these risky assets, they seek safety and move into U.S. Treasury bonds.  \n\n\nTLDR:  $GOVT 6/27 $27 Strike", "created_utc": 1583008299, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fbilaj/thanks_to_our_secretary_of_treasury_steven/", "is_self": true}
