More than I have in the last 5 years playing with stocks. \n\nI am not writing up a huge DD post because frankly time is money. \n\nCommvault is one of NJs best tech company\u2019s. Very undervalued. Q1 2020 they were profitable. Currently trading in the 40s with average price target 45 according to yahoo finance. A Buy rating. Next earning isn\u2019t till end of July so I am long on my calls. \n\nPosition: CVLT 52.50 c Oct 16 20. \n\nI am long hoping that this becomes the next tech stock to get traction. \n\nFigured I would give back since you degenerates share so nicely.", "created_utc": 1591144307.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gvjj90/commvault_cvlt/", "is_self": true}
