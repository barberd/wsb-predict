I'd like to take the time to write this post to pay respects.\n\nDuring his 3-4 years on WallStreetBets, he helped grow the subreddit to what it is today. He was known for his AutoModerator work, teaching AI to recognize Robinhood Screenshots via TensorFlow (I think), mass banning script, bot skills, and much more. One of his publicly notable works was the WSBVoteBot, which gave three members the opportunity to become a mod by using the bot as a medium for moderating, myself being one of the three. I am forever thankful for that opportunity and am really saddened to see you gone. I might not even be on WSB today without you. Even though we did not chat a whole lot over the years, nor did we see the same way on certain things, I am always here if you'd like to talk/vent if you happen to be reading this.\n\nPlease take care and be well.", "created_utc": 1581861776, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f4r0xo/pour_one_out_for_uswineflupandemic/", "is_self": true}
