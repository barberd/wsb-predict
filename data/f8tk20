{"id": "f8tk20", "title": "NOK IS TENDIES", "selftext": "Alright, so NOK doesnt look good to a lot of people. Their earning rates were disappointing. Boo hoo, they still beat what the reports were saying. They also suspended their dividend BUT now they can focus on 5G. Fucking amazing, they already are working on 5G in places like Europe and Japan. I predict the US soon. But look, basically this shit can't go tits up. Right now at $4 a stock, it's a golden opportunity to bust a load into and make profit.\n\nOr sit out, miss this opportunity and don't get YOUR FUCKING TENDIES. More for me, because at the end of the day it's a spectacular stock at a great place to buy.\n\nSauce: https://investorplace.com/2020/02/nok-stock-turnaround/?mod=mw_quote_news\nAlso GlobeNewsWire", "created_utc": 1582561083, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f8tk20/nok_is_tendies/", "is_self": true}
