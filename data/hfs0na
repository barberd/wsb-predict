{"id": "hfs0na", "title": "Preliminary Injunction requested by INO denied. News story not yet broken.", "selftext": "For Inovio\n\nFrom the court records:\nhttps://courtsapp.montcopa.org/psi/v/detail/Case/201231066#/\n\nTheir injunction to get the manufacturer to transfer technology required for scale up was denied. No news on this has been reported yet. Might be a good time to sell while you can and buy back later.\n\nEdit: To explain more thoroughly, up until this point, Inovio has been manufacturing their Covid vaccine and all others through a single manufacturer. When the vaccine began to look promising, Inovio requested the manufacturer scale up in order to make a commercial quantity instead of just the trial amounts they\u2019ve previously been ordering. The manufacturer responded that they would be unable to do that, so Inovio sued them to force them to share the technology, as per their contract in the event of being unable to fill the order. This preliminary injunction would have forced the technology transfer ASAP. Now Inovio will have to wait through this court case.\n\nSome quick and possibly crappy links:\n\nInovio sues manufacturer:\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-03/inovio-tells-court-supplier-is-holding-covid-vaccine-hostage\n\nRuling expected soon (from 2 days ago):\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/news/2020/06/23/inovio-vgxi-covid-19-plymouth-meeting-injunctionr.amp.html\n\nConsidering this is big news, no one seems to have noticed the injunction was denied yet.
