I work at a place where we have a FedEx pick up and drop off station and customers do not stop complaining about the issues they have with the whole FedEx process and their employees. Almost every day I have to take care of some complains about missing packages or where on earth it is. \n\nAlso I never heard a single complaint about UPS. Probably due to the fact we don\u2019t deal with UPS, but the statement is a fact either way. \n\nSecond of all, it looks like it\u2019s about to moon. https://imgur.com/a/jMyzt83\nI know history doesn\u2019t repeat itself, BUT in the world of e-commerce how can UPS be worth less than it was 5 years ago? Plus look at all those ups and downs. \n\nAnd last, UPS does a ton more long distance shipping than FedEx. Maybe they aren\u2019t doing next day deliveries as efficiently, but they are able to reach more customers than other shipping companies will. \n\nAll in all, I\u2019m either selling everything to buy UPS calls or depositing my next paycheck and a half.", "created_utc": 1582603486, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f94aqo/cant_go_tits_ups/", "is_self": true}
