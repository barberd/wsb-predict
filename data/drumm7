Some people on this sub claim that you have to have gazillions of tendies in your brokerage to make any money trading options but I'm living proof that shit isn't true.  As you can see I've been making my run since August and have done pretty fucking well.  I started with a whopping $250 initial investment to get the party started.  I now have about $4k.  Was up $5k a few days ago (it's been a rough week).  Total investment thus far = $500.\n\nA little background about me, I have a steady job, save lots for retirement, own a home (w/mortgage), and have a family.  \n\nRule #1 is don't invest money you can't afford to lose.  25x leverage, fuck that.  Be willing to lose it all and not really give a flying fuck.\n\nRule #2 don't get greedy.  Take your gains and fuck off.  This is a lesson I've learned and will probably continue to learn.\n\nRule #3 don't blow your load YOLOing.  While I don't necessarily adhere to the 1-2% trade rule, I try to spread my nut around.  \n\nRule #4 try different strategies.  I still have a lot to learn and am trying different trading strategies.  Strangles have worked well for me and I plan to try some credit/debit spreads, butterflies and iron condors in the near future.\n\nRule #5 do your own DD.  This sub is great for a laugh and there are some nuggets now and then but don't listen to most of these retards.  \n\nRule #6 find a method that works and diligently adhere to it.  I'm honing my own method (I'm not telling you fucks) but figure out what works and what doesn't, rinse and repeat.\n\nRule #7 don't lose all your money on a shitty trade.  Figure out how much you're willing to sacrifice to Plutus (30%, 40%, etc.) and when you hit this threshold cut the rip cord and live to fight another day.  Stop-Limit to save what ass you have left. I've done this, it sucks but it's better than going bankwupt. \n\n![img](nd9hrj86rsw31 \"Sick Gains\")", "created_utc": 1572930811, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/drumm7/you_can_make_phat_gains_with_a_baby_accountheres/", "is_self": true}
