I saw the AAL, UAL, and AKL all dropped over 10% today. Meanwhile, LUV only dropped about 3.5%, which is about what a normal stock did in today\u2019s market. And amazingly, it\u2019s still .8% up for this past week. It seems like it just closely follows whatever the market is trending for that day, LUV and SPY look pretty similar recently. Is there a reason that Southwest was not as affected as the rest of the airlines? Or is their drop due?", "created_utc": 1583456978, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fe5lwd/why_didnt_southwest_airlines_get_hit_as_hard_as/", "is_self": true}
