Considering most of the major provinces were entirely shutdown this will obviously had a large impact on the revenue and profits of Alibaba.\n\nI think a lot of people consider AlbBaba the Amazon of China, but unlike Amazon AliBaba is really a holdings company that is the poster child for many different Chinese businesses that help produce through ecommerce.\n\nConsidering that AliBaba is an ecommerce business, obviously these divisions of the entire company are entirely reliant upon exportation of goods. \n\nThat would mean during the quarantine these companies would have zero production, exports, or revenue. I would also imagine that because of this there had to be reallocation of cash and other resources to ensure the divisions of the company were able to stay afloat and \"in business\"\n\n*Now I know you're probably thinking \"no shit they are just going to take a hit on their revenue, profits, etc,\"*\n\n**Here's the catch:**\n\nIt's obvious China is an authoritarian government with complete control over it's people and economy.\n\n**But did you know that AliBaba, the face of the Chinese economy, reports their own financial statements to the SEC. There is no investigating, no possible method of verification, yet we still allow US investors to \"invest\" because it is out of our jurisdiction. They report their earnings to SAIC (China's SEC), who then reports it the SEC. But what the fuck is stopping them from propping up balance sheets 10x as an incentive to bring more American cash flow into their own economy.** \n\n**Stop looking at AliBaba as the face of Chinese free markets, the same \"free market\" that bans short selling, and starting see it as the fiscal puppet of the regime.**\n\nIs it crazy to think AliBaba's financial statements are in fact fraudulent, reporting cash balance, revenue, and profits as a result of financial subsidiary by the regime itself? Like what the fuck could the SEC do to verify any of that shit yet it is still listed on our exchanges. \n\nI think there is a huge chance that it's really an initial bubble as an attempt to bring more US money into the Chinese economy. Who the fuck is stopping them from having say $10-100 billion in total assets and reporting shit like previous reported 179% growth in revenue. \n\nAlso note that Jack Ma's foundation sent millions of masks and testing kits to the US today, generous indeed, but you're telling me that China coming out of quarantine and a massive shortage of these products suddenly ramps production that quickly and decides to donate it instead of focusing on gaining back lost profits. Or is it really an attempt to put trust back in the US investors that AliBaba has incredible production capacity.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\n**TL;DR: AliBaba is an unregulated business in authoritarian regime with complete control in any reporting of its balance sheets. With the effects of the corona virus we need to keep an eye out on fraudulent financial statements.**", "created_utc": 1584157573.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fichz6/what_are_the_chances_alibaba_is_a_gigantic_fraud/", "is_self": true}
