{"id": "fat1eb", "title": "Tales From Inside the War Room", "selftext": "Ok listen up cucks, at the end of the day we\u2019re all here to make money whether you are a gay bear or chad bull. True autists know that you can suck a cock and get your fuck on simultaneously, it\u2019s called a three way. Where am I going with all of this - some of you guys don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to actually work at an investment firm when this shit is exploding in front of your eyes. I\u2019ve been on the phone all day talking people off the ledge, our trading volume was so high I had to help put orders through, which hasn\u2019t happened in a while. Yesterday our whole firm had a 15 minute session video conferencing across our offices, with our fearless leader telling everyone to basically calm the fuck down, and buy the fucking dip in pieces because nobody knows when it will bottom out for sure. Most of our clients are invested in diversified equities and fixed income and are really pretty stable for the most part, but it doesn\u2019t stop people from having a full blown panic attack when they turn on fake news claiming the largest point drops ever, when in reality only the percentage matters. I\u2019ve been waking up at 4AM every day over the last couple weeks staring at futures, treasuries and commodities, doubling up my nightly xanax and beer cocktail, knowing what waits for me in the office. It\u2019s one thing to be able to check your phone and trade stonks while taking a shit and then go back to your real job, but it\u2019s another to be a slave to it during times like this, needing to know every second every update so when a client calls in I have all the latest shit. My eyes are glued to the screens all day and they fucking burn when I finally leave. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love my job, but times like this really test your cock and balls. It\u2019s not always so easy to sound happy and reassuring on the phone with clients while my Thomson One screen is flashing blood red, but they are looking to us to hold their hand and walk them through the tough times. When I walk around the office everyone\u2019s face is red and you can feel the anxiety in the room. I try and make jokes to everyone but I\u2019m feeling it too, more than others because just like you I\u2019m leverage to my personal risk tolerance. I\u2019m buying SPY puts and TLT calls with my cash reserves in between getting fucked in the butt, hoping to soften the blow on my real holdings which are still all equities. Unlike a lot of my clients I\u2019m comfortable with way more risk, but it still fucking sucks when your \u2018safe tech stocks\u2019 get bukkaked all over. The true bull and advisor in me knows it will go back up, and I hate making money while sucking cock, but everyone is a little gay sometimes and that\u2019s ok. I hope this was enlightening to those of you who are not in the same line of work. Just remember, bulls make money, bears make money, and pigs get slaughtered.", "created_utc": 1582887403, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fat1eb/tales_from_inside_the_war_room/", "is_self": true}
