We could do it in an industry that is \"undervalued\" such as sex toy industry or gaming industry etc. We can work to release an IPO for our company and get hella tendies. Our stock is going to be shit at first but then we can artificially raise it by doing what Softbank did and taking out loans leveraging our shares then reinvesting in the company. Our company will double to $100m and hella autist moms will start buying. While these autist retarded r/investing kids and other moms buy our stock we can start selling against it. Here we can either cash out or do one last final $DIS call and get the tendies. then in the earnings report, we can declare bankruptcy. If the SEC investigates we can just say we hired an autist CFO for \"corporate social responsibility\" and the entire financial department were special eds from r/wsb, and they would just leave us. \n\nVoila, basically doubled our money and doubled our hookers and cocaine spending in proportion and pulled a Theranos. \n\nWhos in?", "created_utc": 1574132412, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dyees9/infinite_tendies_company_for_the_more_cultured/", "is_self": true}
