{"id": "dhagfl", "title": "Correlation djia/ dax - coca cola", "selftext": "So I have been looking at charts between the two tickers, KO : CCH.L, and they act very very similar.  Of course the Dax does not close before DJIA opens, however the intraday moves the same way from what I have seen.  \n\nI don't have all of the data for current price on DAX when DJIA opens. What I have provided in the link below is the probability of the day's outcome.  \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VdyZDVciUH-yHPvBz25TXF949_rU_XkIQwpmeD-tT3c/edit?usp=sharing\n\n76% of the time they both close the same way bullish or bearish.  I do understand that the intraday entry and exit are the key.  However the peaks and pullbacks I feel can be timed.  Yes KO is adjusting pre market....so I am still missing something here.  \n\n\nI am not a financial advisor if it is not obvious.
