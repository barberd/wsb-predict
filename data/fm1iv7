The witching days are habitually red, and thinking this one would be like any of the others was crazy. In fact, thanks to most of you all these past two days talking about it I held off on calls knowing there was no way it would blast like it did last week. Dont trust random people who post big walls of text, follow the tracks and draw your own conclusions. You're less likely to be left bagholding those 3/23 260c that xxPussySlayerxx promised would print.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHopefully we all learned a valuable lesson, trust your own DD and research, not 3 paragraphs of chart assumptions especially when playing with big money you are too afraid to lose. And if you see EVERYONE on wsb saying one thing, it is probably going the other.  \n\n\nThat said, we are all holding SPY puts for the weekend and I think we will all lose out on them come monday morning.", "created_utc": 1584734072.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fm1iv7/to_everyone_who_was_so_sure_of_the_witching_hour/", "is_self": true}
