(Yes that means stupids like us).\n\n**Outline:**\n\n1. **Current medicines**\n2. **Upcoming medicines**\n3. **Why now**\n\nNo need to even go to the bottom, **TL;DR SPY 220p 4/20**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn December, ITCI got FDA approval for a new drug, Caplyta, for adults with schizophrenia, which became available in pharmacies on March 23. Stock price shot up form $12->$35 as pharma stocks normally due after approvals. Following the trend, it started to decline until there was a stock offering, around $29 for 10,000,000 shares and then it was hit by the CC (corona crash) and is now sitting at $15.81.\n\nTheir, drug, which on the word of my psychiatrist is quite novel, and only has mild side effects. But that is besides the point. Effective drug, mild side effects and 3.5 million adults means some decent sales.[some numbers or something](https://sardaa.org/resources/about-schizophrenia/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut that's not even the best part, they have a few trials in phase three for Biploar depression and Dementia.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/20sdqqpfu1r41.png?width=1226&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa351c357f85d79c66d38c97d14203889ab0b09c\n\n[Image Link](https://www.intracellulartherapies.com/technology-and-pipeline/)\n\n**Yes yes, an FDA approval**, even in phase 3 can take up to three years or more. But here is the saucey part, the same drug that got approved for schizophrenia is the one currently on trial for bipolar and dementia (along with the necessary additions). While this doesn't prove a lot to us, we do know that this drug has already been approved for other disorders, so it seems the safety of it may no longer be on trial, but rather the effectiveness of treating other disorders. Now I'm not well versed on FDA approvals, and I'd ask anyone to read more about it, or ask someone who knows a bit more the process before listening to anything I say here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The last point**, people don't stop buying medicine during a virus, people are still going to need their pills. So while the stock is already priced down because of corona, it might be worth taking a look at investing, because if there earnings is at all good, then the company is probably going to go from being your average pharma stock, to perhaps having a few reasonable treatments on the market.\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nSorry to break whatever order I had when I started, here is a link providing specific information about the drugs currently in trials: [10-Q](https://ir.intracellulartherapies.com/news-releases/news-release-details/intra-cellular-therapies-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-5), or if you don't want to read that:\n\n\" Our global adjunctive bipolar depression Phase 3 trial, Study 402, is ongoing.\u00a0 We anticipate reporting topline results from this trial in mid-2020. \"\n\nand\n\n\" Subject to the results of Study 402 and our interactions with the FDA regarding our bipolar depression program, in late 2020 we expect to submit a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) to the FDA for regulatory approval for lumateperone for the treatment of bipolar depression. \"\n\nor if you don't know how to read paragraphs:Results for one drug come back mid 2020, the other is submitted late 2020.\n\nSome things to think about:\n\n1. I don't know much and this is my first time doing research on a stock\n2. You'd probably want to know something about the FDA approvals process before investing\n3. I don't know how much of the schizophrenia economic pie they are going to take from existing brands\n4. Before their next drug gets approved, they'll probably start hiring drug reps, to promote the new drug after its approved, you could look at this as an indicator for approvals (I think)\n\nI honestly don't know if I could recommend an options play on this stock because of the timelines, but if you keep it in your back pocket for a couple months and drug gets approved for a different disorder, you could possibly see some nice returns.", "created_utc": 1586114296.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fvjhcg/a_look_into_itci/", "is_self": true}
