Last night was stressing, thinking what have I done lol. Even though I'm 90% sure of myself and am right 90% of the time on stock movements (over course of at least 2 weeks) I can't hold that long (lost out a lot on early exit throughout my trades), so early this morning when CRM was above 152 I sold. Ended up basically break even, but it dropped soon after so good choice in my book. \n\nEnded up buying FDs on CRM instead for only 1k when it was near its 150.5 low. Willing to lose 1k, but not the 20k I had on the line even though I don't see any way it can drop below 150, or not rise to 155+ as soon as end of week but definitely by next week. Will make a lot if it gets to 155+ like I think it will.\n\nOther play is LULU earnings. I am bullish so got 1k FDs calls. Pure gamble but I don't do that often.\n\nSo what are your moves today?", "created_utc": 1560353284, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bzsla1/plays_for_today_now_that_you_see_how_market_opened/", "is_self": true}
