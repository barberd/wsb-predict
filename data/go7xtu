We can't, yet. \n\n\"The closing price of the company's shares in the market must have a minimum per-share price for a majority of trading days during the three prior calendar months. The current minimum price is **$3.00 per share** for \"covered securities\" or $7.50 per share for non-covered securities.\" - CBOE rules\n\nIn case you missed it, NNDM just accomplished a **world-first** in Additive Manufacturing, or \"3D printing\", specifically for high performance and military grade electronics. We're talking about 3D printing thick and durable microchips, with electronics soldered to both sides, meeting the specs for military and ISS use. This has never been done before in history, and the Intellectual Property value here is extraordinary.\n\nhttps://www.nano-di.com/investor-news/hensoldt-and-nano-dimension-achieve-breakthrough-in-electronics-3d-printing\n\n*NNDM owns the patent to both types of \"inks\" used to manufacture this process.* Inks are the material the printer jets out and layers to 3D print an object. 3D printing military-grade, double-sided microchips is especially hard, and this company is now proven to be the best and only in the world.\n\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/02/25/1741237/0/en/Nano-Dimension-Receives-Patent-Approval-from-both-the-U-S-and-Korea-Patents-and-Trademark-Offices-for-Innovative-Dielectric-Ink.html\n\nThis accomplishment means NNDM has successfully condensed the laborious production process of the highest performance computer chips in the world into a singular 3D printing unit, the DRAGONFLY LDM, with its **patented inks**: AgCite Nanoparticle Silver Ink\nDielectric Nanoparticle Polymer Ink, being the keys to unlocking this process.\n\nThis news broke Tuesday 5/19. Share price promptly jumps to close at $3.40, (reached $6 AH) after sitting at ~$0.70 for months. NNDM announces 18M direct offering at $2 per share the next day which will only increase outstanding shares from 27M to 25M. These shares hit market tomorrow, but the news is priced in already: closed today at $3.09. Intense volume the last few days, and MM's are now making sure this ticker will be optionable ASAP.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/nano-dimension-prices-35-9-124241223.html\n\nIMO this is a prime buy and solid company: true blue-chip in the making, or a strong buyout target. Their CTO has a remarkable track record as well, and this IP is a game-changer. Once this stock becomes optionable, I'm sure you can imagine the tendies. For now, go long and make THETA work for you. Good luck every gang.\n\nnote on the chart - 1:10 Reverse split in 10/2019. Listed on NASDAQ in 2016, I believe at what would have been $8 at the time. This was indeed a tech penny stock a few weeks ago, trading at $0.07 relative to 2016 (300M initial offering). The true value of its IP has not been realized until the PR 2 days ago. Now, you can buy at the new bedrock: $3.00. Welcome everyone!\n\nPS: if this works out all I'd ask for is a sweet Nano Dimensional Oracle flair.", "created_utc": 1590103960.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/go7xtu/nndm_will_never_close_below_300_again/", "is_self": true}
