Couple of reasons why...   \n\n1) They have dropped in price and most analysts have them at a buy or strong buy.   \n\n2) No recommendations are showing a sell or hold since Jan.  \n\n3) The value is way under what it should be.   Experts suggest that they should be at 12.50 average right now.   Low 8.00 and high 16.00.   \n\nI think this is poised to be a good investment.   Crossing my fingers!   \n\nReference:\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/EVRI?p=EVRI&.tsrc=fin-srch](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/EVRI?p=EVRI&.tsrc=fin-srch)", "created_utc": 1588012770.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g96kyj/anyones_thoughts_on_evri/", "is_self": true}
