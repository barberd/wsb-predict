Final damage before TDA liquidated my account.", "selftext": "Final damage screenshot seconds before account was liquidated:  \n    \nhttps://i.imgur.com/e0sEWEm.jpg\n\nThanks to me UPRO and TMF now are 50% stress tests on TOS, no margin reduction credit, and from 36% and 24% stress tests respectively. Or maybe I'm on reg-t when I took the screenshot, IDK and IDC. Talking with risk management apparently I flew under the radar as they didn't see a margin balance due to the box spread until other account alerts went off as customer service will take a look in when anyone is negative 1 million or more PnL as a courtesy to chat with their clients. Needless to say customer service was horrified and I got another margin phone call to wire in $1,250,000 in the next five minutes or they'd liquidate. I guess they give Portfolio Margin customers a little bit more leeway... \n\nI took the five minutes to grab this one final screenshot. I'm hoping for some bailout money from coronavirus too. \n\nI talked with the bankruptcy lawyer that set me up with the asset protection plan and he already dropped me as a client. I never imagined beer-virus would do this to me. \n\nI'm gonna take some time to just not think about the virus or anything else. \n\n# TL;DR what strike/put/call/etc\n\nI discovered a bug in my broker's risk management software. I guess buy RCL calls per my previous DD.\n\nEdit:\nPrevious post entering the trade and proof of portfolio margin/etc:     \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fepd4q/portfolio_margin_is_10x_worse_than_u1r0nymans_box/", "created_utc": 1584650225.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flhb0d/i_failed_my_portfolio_margin_call_final_damage/", "is_self": true}
