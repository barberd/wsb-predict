I was wondering if anyone has been monitoring pharmacy companies in anticipation for earnings?\n\nPersonally I was looking at RAD for the past few weeks. I had a call position for April 17, which is about a week or so after they release earnings. However, due to the virus I sold my calls for a minor loss and converted my positions to puts. \n\nI am still really liking RAD under the new management and how they beat earnings 2 Qs in a row. They look like they are doing some fantastic work, and about a week ago they got Bank of America to buy a bunch of their receivables for 500M in cash - the cash will come in October 30th if I am remembering correctly (which is crazy considering their cap is around 700-800M over the past few weeks)\n\nI'm also wondering if their next Q will be even more profitable with people running to pharmacies to get supplements in fear of this virus. There is also a fairly large amount of short positions on RAD, the position has been increasing over the past week as the stock continues to trend down with the market. However, I think earnings could really turn the stock hard. But I'm also slightly fearful that there will be too much bad news for even a positive earnings report to do much to the stock.", "created_utc": 1583150256, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fcazz9/thoughts_on_pharmacy_stocks_in_the_next_few/", "is_self": true}
