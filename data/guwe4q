{"id": "guwe4q", "title": "Nokia's Time to Shine", "selftext": "I know this stonk is always the bud of jokes with everyone always saying 'this time it's different' and 'they're coming back for real now', but it seems like this might be the moment. I made a post on them at the beginning of this year and jumped into the 1/15/21 4C contracts at 64 cents per contract. They proceeded to go up into the 90s, then dropped all the way down to 10 cents in March. You better believe I diamond dicked my way through March and held on, and they finally are back in the green,  closing at 69 cents today. Nokia was up over 6% today and appears to be getting the double pump, jumping after hours another 5% already.\n\nRecent technical crayons - Passed the 200ema on the highest volume since earnings with no significant company news. Upgraded by ANALysts, Barron's and Investor Place are pumping the shit out of them right now with 2 articles in the last 3 days, and they are now above their levels pre-beerflu, signaling high optimism around their 5G rollout.\n\nMacro/Fundamental Shit - People are trying to diversify away from China (Huawei) in this environment, which leaves more opportunity for companies like NOK and ERIC to pick up the slack. Nokia is on pace to generate FCF by EOY and restore the dividend to full strength sooner rather than later. Based on comparative valuations in the industry, they are a steal as well.\n\nI would recommend the contracts I'm holding if you think I'm the good kind of autistic. If you need more deep level 'tism then go for the 5Cs and leverage up to your personal risk tolerance. Another benefit of this play is that the contracts are so cheap because of how low priced the shares are, and also extremely liquid. You can dip your dick in the honey without fucking the bees, and that's just how I like it.", "created_utc": 1591056488.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/guwe4q/nokias_time_to_shine/", "is_self": true}
