This \u201cloophole\u201d is a result of their system not using the value of the contract that was sold to offset the cash received from writing the calls. What SHOULD happen is you sell a call for say $2,000, then the value of the contract should be close to $2,000 and be accounted for in the account as a -$2,000 holding so that the total equity in his account doesn\u2019t go up by $2,000 like it did to open up Reg T buying power. By accounting for the value of the contract as a negative number, the total equity goes up by $0 (or close to it since the value of the contract will be changing all the time) when the premium is credited to the account, which would prevent the ability to use margin to buy more shares of the underlying.
