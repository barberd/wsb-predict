Obviously I lost all three. LULU and COST both had positive earnings releases and even exceeded EPS, but it boilded down to they were over valued and it didn't impress wallstreet expectations. MU I decided to do puts on because even if they met EPS, they are over valued and stock would fall. Turns out it was a revinue miss and they made EPS but only to the dot.  And they STILL went up in value! This is driving me broke! Help please so I don't keep making the same mistakes.", "created_utc": 1576707515, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ecjm88/what_am_i_missing_about_playing_earnings_lulu/", "is_self": true}
