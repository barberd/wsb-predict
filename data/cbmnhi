{"id": "cbmnhi", "title": "Short $LYFT", "selftext": "Currently sitting in a LYFT on my way downtown for dinner with my girlfriend. We have already endured the following: \n\n1. Horrid odor of cigarette smoke in the car. Awful.\n\n2. Car seat in the back upon arrival. I am currently sitting in the front while my girlfriend sits in the back. I enjoy holding hands with my girlfriend and cannot do so due to seating constraints. Terrible.\n\n3. Driver insisted upon taking us on the expressway downtown, ignoring Google\u2019s directions and our pleas that the expressway is plagued with construction. Pathetic. \n\nSHORT $LYFT! Despite my absolute hatred of $UBER, I will be longing it and holding regardless of financial outlook! SAD Lyft! SAD!", "created_utc": 1562793696, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cbmnhi/short_lyft/", "is_self": true}
