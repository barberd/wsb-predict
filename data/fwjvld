Bulls are interpreting this as a positive economic outlook. The market is rallying on this bizarre interpretation.\n\nWhile I am genuinely pleased to see infection rates slow, our only realistic exit is herd immunity. The economy will not reach an inflection point to recovery until the majority of our population have become infected. The lockdowns are responsible for the slowing infection rates. The lockdowns prolong the timeline for herd immunity. Do not be fooled.\n\nAt the time of writing, the US has 368k confirmed cases -- up from 1k confirmed cases three weeks ago. Even if the spread slows us back down to a few thousand active cases, lifting the lockdowns will just kickstart a second wave of mass infection.", "created_utc": 1586263508.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fwjvld/psa_slowing_infection_rates_are_at_odds_with/", "is_self": true}
