{"id": "b6y3up", "title": "$LYFT ....... $SNAP explained?", "selftext": "Snapchat is still up 89% in the last 3 months.... WTF?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHad a conversation with a friend over a LOT of booze around this one last night. Could the banks and tutes be propping up SNAP before the LYFT IPO so they can trick people in to thinking LYFT isn't going to be worth 1/4th the IPO price in a year? I mean.... SNAP was at $5 and doubled..... Someone wants retail to think losing money is \"invest-able\" and the narrative around SNAP's eventual demise wasn't going to bode well for the tech IPO market. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe I'm just pissed that SNAP puts will expire worthless today and most likely would be worth major tendies after the gaming launch/pump/fail. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe the banks want retail thinking over-hyped IPOs have a shot even when the underlying business does nothing but burn money. SNAP's short squeeze to 11 sure does look a lot better for LYFT than if it were at it's actual value which is under $5 IMO", "created_utc": 1553870520, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b6y3up/lyft_snap_explained/", "is_self": true}
