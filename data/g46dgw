{"id": "g46dgw", "title": "Fastest monthly jobgrowth ever was in 1983. One month added 1,118\u201d jobs. At that rate it would take 20 months to regain all the jobs lost so far", "selftext": "https://data.bls.gov/pdq/SurveyOutputServlet\n\nSo that was the fastest growth ever in the US for a single month. The following months was above average at 300k+. Adjusting for population that would equate to 1,6\u201d jobs added in one month. We have no idea how the job market will act once restrictions begin to lift but it would be reasonable to assume we get an initial boom in employment followed by a slower pace.\n\nJust for fun, let\u2019s do some massive assumptions:\n\nJob losses stops at 30\u201d (two more weeks of losses.. that is optimistic in other words) \n\nInitial boom is 10\u201d for the first month\n4\u201d second month\n3\u201d third month\n2\u201d fourth\n1,6\u201d fifth\nThis leaves us with 9,4\u201d still unemployed\nFollow that up with a slower but still accelerated pace of 400k/month on average it would take an additional 24 months to get back.\nAll in all 29 months to get back to 4% unemployment\n\nSo what does this tell us? **Even if we \u201conly\u201d get another 8\u201d jobs lost AND the first five months have an average 12,5x ***(10+4+3+2+1,6=20,6/1,6=12,5)* **the previous RECORD monthly job growth we could still be looking at 2,5 years before we are back at previous levels...**. And those are optimistic numbers I would argue.\n\nThis at the same time as the rest of the world is trying to do the same. Way more added debt on corporate and national level from already record highs. Fear/caution regarding a second wave. A consumer that dramatically increases their savings-rate (paying off debt / regular savings) as always happens after a crisis. All of this in an economy (the US) that is 70% consumer driven.\n\nTLDR: it\u2019s fucked up. A depression scenario is the most likely for a few years. How this is still assumed by the markets to get a U- (or even V-!) shaped recovery is insane.\n\nPlease prove me completely wrong. My puts are counting on this. \n\n$130k TSLA 525p for September down to $50k now.
