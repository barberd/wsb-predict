{"id": "fy9g41", "title": "The Bull Market is Dead", "selftext": "I posted a short DD regarding the fed and why I think their actions are pointing towards long term economic stagnation. You can check my recent posts to read but it basically says that the fed foresees a slowdown and that they are taking these measures because things are bad.\n\nListed below are some charts that I have been keeping track of since the start of this crisis. Perhaps the most alarming chart is that we broke right through the 10-year trend line that we established following the great recession.  The other chart simply shows what kind of trading range we are in. I will note that I typically find horizontal lines to be more reliable and do not like trends unless I can see them on the weekly chart. I'm not one to praise charts, but they are useful to measure risk and potential opportunities present within the market. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b7uzkb8gexr41.png?width=1814&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ef1792060727c056122cbc25b7b6b8200bb5033\n\nShall the event occur where we break the 10-year trend line again, I think we will go to 214 or lower. This area is heaviest in the volume profile and is clear horizontal support. (support to me and how I read charts)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0r2nanxjexr41.png?width=1818&format=png&auto=webp&s=645c1ff7028747020663107c44b0cbeea30eefe6\n\nFinally, I included another chart of running PE Ratios. We again see a range in which the tendency is to revert to the mean. Given that profits are likely to slip for the next few quarters, its not unlikely that we will revert to this mean before seeing fair valuations appear.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1s1qdfllexr41.png?width=1158&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b8297bad5ff9ba160ce356864c2b2727a04a93b\n\n**Please keep in mind** that bear markets take time. They wear investors down until absolute conviction and flip the opposite direction. **We could be stuck in this trading range for months**.  **NOTE**: A lot of markets in Europe still haven't topped out after '08 and definitely aren't in 2020. If you need any more evidence that we could move sideways for years look at the trading range of SPX from 1997-2013.\n\nPositions : July 17 240 Puts\n\nTLDR: Long term bullish trend at risk which could send us to 214. Reversion to mean likely to take place in company values and unlikely to see all-time highs in most names for quite some time.", "created_utc": 1586497253.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fy9g41/the_bull_market_is_dead/", "is_self": true}
