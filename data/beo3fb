Aiming for TIGR because the market cap looks more promising.. \n\nThey all follow the same weekly trend\nPrevious similar chart patterns and all 2019 IPO \"holdings\" listed about a month ago so start there, look at the 1 week points to present, all gains. But then again it can all be coincidental being that theyre all new.. Whats your outlook longtirm for TIGR is the question for that 1.7B market cap?\n\nIMAC - https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/imac/interactive-chart?timeframe=1m\n\nWTRE - https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/wtre/interactive-chart\n\nTHCBU - \nhttps://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/thcbu/interactive-chart?timeframe=1m\n\nIve only looked into TIGR though.. And have another email subscription to look forward to lol..\n\nWhats your outlook longtirm for TIGR is the question for that 1.7B market cap?", "created_utc": 1555607506, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/beo3fb/i_never_thought_id_post_here_but_i_need_second_or/", "is_self": true}
