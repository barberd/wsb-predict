{"id": "bkrp8x", "title": "$AMZN", "selftext": "So looks like monday is going to start with a loss.  Hope no one purchased calls, the stock is already overbought.  Historically management starts selling more and more shares when the price reaches to the point it is now. Seems like $2k is the tipping point for $AMZN as beyond that price its unattractive to investors.  If anything I would do a put spread but even that is fucking expensive with amazon.  As management sells shares the price will be lowered and then more buys from investors (repeat cycle).  It may not drop too much due to this.. Not to late to cancel those calls you bought after thinking warren buffet loves $AMZN. Bet WB has PUTS when his best friends at amazon sell their shares.  Ill come back monday and see how you did :)", "created_utc": 1557015837, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bkrp8x/amzn/", "is_self": true}
