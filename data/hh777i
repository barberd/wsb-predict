{"id": "hh777i", "title": "$FSLY going up", "selftext": "Alright so this week I bought some FSLY calls, and panic-sold the next day wiping over half of my all time gains. If I had just waited a couple more days I would've doubled my portfolio instead. This stock has nothing, but good news. Sure the owners are constantly selling their stocks, but they're not hedge funds or investors. They just probably need the cash. I'm tired of being cucked and I think this shit can hit a 100 dollars in the next couple weeks. I'm going to put my remaining cash into calls and just stop checking RH for a few days. The line is mostly under 20MA, which seems like a strong bullish trend. Am I an idiot?", "created_utc": 1593313655.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hh777i/fsly_going_up/", "is_self": true}
