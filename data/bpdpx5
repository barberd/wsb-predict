I can't really complain about the amounts of money I've lost, but it's been four times now where I buy options at what I think is the peak high/low of the day and it always goes up 10-15 cents after I go in.\n\n  \nMy luck has been fucking garbage. This happened most recently with GPRO puts, where I went in on the second peak at $6.60, then it shot up to $6.80, then crushed earnings going up to I think $7.40. The next day it dropped to around $6.70, decided to recover some of my losses and sold here. Literally 15 minutes after I sold it dropped to $6.45.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis morning I bought 8 SNAP puts at $6.35 (was around +6% here), and it's still somehow going up lol. I have basic understanding of bot manipulation and I know I'm retarded, hence why I'm here, but is there something I'm missing?", "created_utc": 1558019370, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bpdpx5/missed_a_peak_for_the_fourth_time_in_a_row/", "is_self": true}
