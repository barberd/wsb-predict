I honestly don\u2019t think we are equipped half as well as China is to deal with an outbreak in Chicago or another major metropolitan area.\n\nHow long will trading rest on coronavirus news? It\u2019s simple math: the 2 week incubation period minus the attention span of the average bull tells us this news should blow over by Wednesday.

They have pulled doctors from all over the country to fight this. I truly believe they have this under control within their own borders, but the problem ultimately rests with us and other countries that have seen patients show up.\n\nI will mention however, one of my coworkers from the mainland said that the Wuhan region is surrounded by forested areas and thus lots of wild animals etc. and that after SARS in 2003 they predicted the next outbreak would be from that area because of this. Well here we are. He also said \u201cin some of the southern areas of China they eat everything that flies except the plane, and everything on the ground except the train\u201d. So you can imagine how easy it is for outbreaks like this to occur.
