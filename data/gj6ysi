Just not as good a day as yesterday - but I'll take an up day over a down day any day of the week. I did well in the first hour, but my losses halved my gains from that time - and then ran out of free cash.\n\nToday was another hold my breath at open and see where we go - I managed to stay patient and find good entry points. I was tracking OKTA, TWLO, WIX, CODX, and DDOG this morning - and managed to get into good entry points on CODX, TWLO, and DDOG. Unfortunately CODX went the wrong direction and got stopped out quickly in the morning - If I had the cash I was looking at reentering at around 1PM when the MACD crossed - but missed out on those +200% tendies - would've been around $350 additional.\n\nAfter TWLO and DDOG worked out, I got impatient looking for some new plays, and dropped into NVDA, ZM, and got pretty quickly stopped out of those as well, with those losses halving my gains for the day. Glad that I got stopped out of them - but wish I had respected the MACD for NVDA and not gotten in when I did- it was overbought and crossing in the wrong direction. ZM was also overbought but hadn't crossed yet. SPY then fell out and that was the day.\n\n* Lesson for the day is patience - wait for the good plays, they will come. For example as I'm writing this CRM, WIX, and VTIQ are solidly heading in the direction I like and I was tracking them.\n* Another lesson is watching my trailing stops a bit closer - they were a bit too tight on DDOG, the small drop below consolidation at 10:15 caught it out.\n* Final lesson is that sectors tend to move together - I could've caught OKTA along with TWLO but I moved a bit too slow on it and missed the entry - that should come with experience though\n\n**The Plan:**\n\n1. Get a TDA cash account and fund with $2000\n2. Play intra-day swing and momentum trades\n3. Cut losses early and often - wins will accumulate over losses.\n4. Take profits Regularly\n   1. Account Balance $4000 - take $2000 to cover initial investment\n   2. Account Balance $14328 - take $12328 to cover cash losses\n   3. Account balance of $6057.37 - take $4057.37 to cover equity losses\n\n**Position History:**\n\nDay 3: 5/13 +8.35% - $1356.57 - $1469.84\n\n|Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|CODX 6/19 20C|\\-$22|1|$277|$255|\n|TWLO 5/22 200C|\\+$174|1|$469|$643|\n|DDOG 5/15 70C|\\+$45|1|$200|$245|\n|NVDA 5/15 335C|\\-$39|1|$213|$174|\n|ZM 5/15 180C|\\-$39|1|$180|$141|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDay 2: 5/12 +29.53% - $1046.34 - $1356.57\n\n|Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|CRM 6/19 200C|\\+2|1|$263|$265|\n|EGHT 6/19 20C|\\+59|1|$191|$250|\n|TWLO 5/29 205C|\\+30|1|$370|$400|\n|VTIQ 5/15 30C|\\+224|2|$103|$215|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDay 1: 5/11 +5% - $1000.89 - $1046.34\n\n|Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|DDOG 5/15 55c|\\+54|1|$380|$434|\n|CSCO 5/15 44.5c|\\-16|2|$214|$198|\n|CHWY 5/15 39.5c|\\+12|1|$134|$146|\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1589401482.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gj6ysi/day_3_513_from_down_to_up_the_road_to_1838537_835/", "is_self": true}
