Volume will continue to drop until news of extreme good or extreme bad brings voters to the booth, so to speak. This leads us to a classic \"it will go up or down\" scenario, but first the theta decay will continue to eat any options in the sub-30 day category alive. If you're under 50-25% value on your options at this point, and 14+ days out, and you don't care about money, I'd hold for your miracle. If you're under 25%, pray for rain, and sell for sprinkles under 7 days. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWSB loves to lose money because :diamond hands:, otherwise known as the \"I've already lost the foot, I may as well lose the leg\" strategy. If you're trying to make money, you should be scalping an edge, or selling the news. (Currently there is no news). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat you should be waiting for: \n\nMortgage industry collapse: \n\n [https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-04-02/home-mortgage-default](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-04-02/home-mortgage-default) \n\n [https://www.inman.com/2020/04/13/jpmorgan-chase-tightens-mortgage-lending-standards-amid-uncertainty/](https://www.inman.com/2020/04/13/jpmorgan-chase-tightens-mortgage-lending-standards-amid-uncertainty/) \n\n [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/13/coronavirus-requests-for-mortgage-bailout-jump-78percent-in-one-week.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/13/coronavirus-requests-for-mortgage-bailout-jump-78percent-in-one-week.html) \n\n [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/business/coronavirus-companies-restructuring-bankruptcy.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/business/coronavirus-companies-restructuring-bankruptcy.html) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis tells us that liquidity is drying up, as expected. I've not been able to find any significant closures, one bankruptcy out of the California area I can't find the link for, but was only approx $156mil company. Not a large fish by any means, but it is the correct first sign that small higher risk lenders are likely to start failing. For a shitty and quick explanation of this process: \n\n [https://thefinancebuff.com/what-happens-when-your-mortgage-lender.html](https://thefinancebuff.com/what-happens-when-your-mortgage-lender.html) \n\nThe simple fact is that the fed has ALREADY taken on more debt in a shorter amount of time than it ever has before. This is available to view on its balance sheet, as it took on a pile of debt in order to 'buy' assets the same way a pawn shop does. Except the pawn shop, rather than need to be profitable, knows it can just take tax payer money to pay for the shit it bought.  \n\n [https://wolfstreet.com/2020/03/20/feds-balance-sheet-spikes-as-everything-bubble-morphs-into-financial-crisis-2/](https://wolfstreet.com/2020/03/20/feds-balance-sheet-spikes-as-everything-bubble-morphs-into-financial-crisis-2/) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf the fed tries to take on enough debt to buy the mortgage market out, we will most likely see inflation as the fed needs to continue to print money to meets its most basic needs. While this was a worry circa 2010, the unemployment rate only jumped 5% over approximately 16-18 months. We've jumped (conservatively) 10% in 3 weeks: \n\n [https://www.businessinsider.com/record-unemployment-filings-jobless-claims-coronavirus-recession-economic-slowdown-2020-4](https://www.businessinsider.com/record-unemployment-filings-jobless-claims-coronavirus-recession-economic-slowdown-2020-4) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSimply put, the system is extremely unlikely to be able to handle the shock. Adding to our above Mortgage thesis, we have to add unemployment payments to the already huge problem. States that pay unemployment will start to see within a month or two will see the math on the wall that their unemployment funds banks will run dry due to shock. Who will they turn to when 15-20% of their citizens are living on zero dollars? The Fed, who is already broke. \n\n [https://www.cbpp.org/research/introduction-to-unemployment-insurance](https://www.cbpp.org/research/introduction-to-unemployment-insurance) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat we should be looking for here? States with already high unemployment are most likely to start failing. They'll be able to short-sell by stealing funds from their other pots to cover temporarily, but there will likely be announcements about tertiary programs getting cut (because they had to de-fund them to pay for unemployment). \n\n [https://money.cnn.com/interactive/economy/state-unemployment-rates/](https://money.cnn.com/interactive/economy/state-unemployment-rates/) \n\nHow does the government get the economy started again? Well, pretty simple, it needs to hire everyone. Think this is crazy socialism? See \"The new deal\" and \"World War II\" for the largest employment opportunities of the 1930s. I could foresee some capitulation by conservatives for a UBI to dig out of this, if the people have to do something similar to The New Deal. This is a way for them to save face when they really just want to tell poor people that they should just die off. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo where are we now? We're face checking over the side of the cliff, waiting for the push. Remember that plunge periods are exponential in momentum, while growth periods are compounding. When you think you're ready to get on the ride, check your indicators, get on, and hold tight. You'll be wrong, you'll miss the top by 5-10% on either side, and that's OK. If you're airing on the side of caution, it is better to be late than early. If you see a circuit breaker, you're already late, but better late than never. Play short windows and reload for as many bounces as you can for exponential growth (and risk) on that RH account. Pull 30% out on reloads if you want to make a ton of money and still have a 90% ride. The smartest play is to bank your original risk and play the 'free' money.  The fall will likely last around 45%-55% of the previous 33 day fall, so somewhere in about 2-2.5 weeks. \n\nDon't be terribly fooled by the Governors talking about re-opening. They will, and the market should bounce a good bit up on the news. The businesses that went out of business will not be magically 'reopened'. The unemployed will not just magically find jobs at the job store. Schools that were cancelled for the year will not magically re-open. People will not magically be un-afraid of CV19 and start going to restaurants/movie theatres/ or buying cars at DEC2019 levels. Their logical play here is to try and limit the rate of decline for the next plunge, not to prevent it. Bears get ready, bulls tread lightly. \n\nPositions: \n\nCash only while intra-day trading. \n\nAs previously stated, I've continued to intraday trade only. Something stupid is keeping my TD Ameritrade acct from xferring my funds to the options bankroll, so I'm stuck in stocks only till that gets resolved. I've been working on a continuously variable stoploss formula for previous <timeframe> volatility to create adaptive stoplosses on the fly for smaller time-frame trading (sub 1 minute). \n\n60ish trades friday for a total of -.10c, pretty happy with that result considering it was the first test of my open ended stop loss idea. Today was bungled and I practiced freehanding the 15 second chart for 120 trades in 60min, also for -.10c.
