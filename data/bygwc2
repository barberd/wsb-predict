{"id": "bygwc2", "title": "$FB prediction for week of 6/10-6/14", "selftext": "So today I stumbled upon the amount of call volume for 6/14 that went through the roof at the $180 strike price. CNBC did a halftime report on it spotlighting just under 10k in volume. At close, volume was just shy of 38,000. They usually have a run up to earnings, but I\u2019m not convinced it will have the same successful run up this time around. Here\u2019s my DD\n\nChart analysis: https://ibb.co/zXY8Trz\n\nAs you can see on the 3 day chart, the yellow line on the bottom shows RSI around 50% and moves within a healthy range of median. The top channel in between the yellow lines show a fair price around $167-$168. You can see on Wednesday that there was the most volume and the price was steady between the $167-$168 range. Thursday had less volume, but stayed within range for the most part, but did hit $169, but wasn\u2019t overbought. It was a healthy gain. Now looking at Friday, volume was high, traded $4-$5 higher, but RSI was over 70 majority of the day and didn\u2019t fall below 68 at all. \n\nThe Put call ratio is .006 for 6/14 $180s way in favor of calls. Now this can mean one of two things:\n\n1) someone is trying to offload a shit on of shares at that strike and doesn\u2019t want the price to drop with a major sell off. I don\u2019t see this as the case, but maybe it is. \n\n2) market makers want to make money on writing calls to make up for the money they lost holding this stock before they sell their shares so they make more of a profit on the sale.  I see this as being the top since their was a decent amount of short interest this week. I\u2019m in favor of this more than anything. Maybe they got wind of the discussions at G20 early and want to get out of Facebook. Maybe they just want to squeeze more money out of the market not expecting a $180 hit by Friday. Who knows? Bottom line, it just doesn\u2019t look right. \n\nSo from my prediction, I think FB is going to possibly run up in the short term Monday to sell more calls, but more than likely I think buyers just got trapped in calls that they thought were cheap and now there will be shares offloaded and bring the stock lower. Maybe not $150 in a week, but I see it at least getting back to mid $160s. If there\u2019s a big sell off on Monday, the calls will more than likely be worthless. I don\u2019t see an uptrend continuing for FB in the short term. \n\nBuy 6/14 $170p or fuck it and lotto some $160p and scrape some pennies while this shit is falling. Fuck, might even end up being ITM if there\u2019s some major sell off action. Good luck out there.", "created_utc": 1560056949, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bygwc2/fb_prediction_for_week_of_610614/", "is_self": true}
