Some other discussion items on 2), 3), and 4).\n\n**1) Adjusted EBITDA**\n\nI am confused with this Adjusted EBITDA figure because I do think the actual EBITDA is lower than -$612m. See, there are two ways of getting to EBITDA from income statements and I know there is no standard measure for this so companies add back any item they feel under \"Adjustments\"..\n\nBut if you're curious, the easiest way to look at this is starting off from Revenue...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ol6ohyynumx41.png?width=1140&format=png&auto=webp&s=fea3361b94442109bff24ca707855a09e89a0554\n\nHere the easiest way to look at EBITDA is by deducting cost of revenue, operating expenses, R&D expenses and basically anything above your operating profit. Usually depreciation is not reported separately, but UBER does so (see the note that cost of revenue is exclusive of depreciation anyway) so no need to add back. Another item to add back that makes sense is the stock-based compensation which is part of your operation expenses in the income statement but is a non-cash item so doing all of this brings us to a proper EBITDA loss of $858m.\n\nNow the way UBER calculate their Adjusted EBITDA is by reconciling from Net income, which is shown here.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w58eca0bvmx41.png?width=708&format=png&auto=webp&s=9de2d7adffb749adb4d56c848d0cd4ca9a2c80e7\n\nYou would expect these two reconciliations to be consistent but let's say UBER does add back other items such as COVID-19 response etc (which they actually adjust in revenue but it would not matter from a math perspective).\n\nYou see, the logic is that all the other items should somehow need to be reflected in your income statement such as the interest expense, net loss to minority, other income etc. One of the weird items here is the goodwill and asset impairments adjustment of $193m, which actually is not shown anywhere in the income statement. Typically, I'd expect to see the loss in there but while it is shown in CF statement, it is not part of the other items in income statement. So while you start off with your Income statement reported Net income, you go and add back an item that is not there.\n\nSo it looks like our difference of $246m, can be attributed to COVID response of 24m, UBER eats india transaction of 10m, and some legal, tax items of $19m and that $193m...I think it makes sense to add back some of these items but not including that $193m in the income statement is weird to me, as its already being adjusted in the cash flow statement.\n\n**2) Year over year growth**\n\nWhile for certain businesses looking at year over year results makes sense because of seasonality, I don't see why it would make sense for a growth stock like UBER.  It is only natural to beat your metric that is from 3 quarters a go, simply because you are growth stock. And market has already priced in that growth a year a go anyway. So year over year is meaningless, especially when quarter over quarter UBER has shrunk and not grown.\n\nSo when we have Q2 and Q3 results that will not beat their year over year measures given how things look, what is the headline going to be?\n\n**3) Business trips and Pooling and COVID**\n\nI do think one economies of scale of shared drive companies have is the pooling service, by which you generate more revenue for almost the same cost/mileage - something Taxi cab drivers would dream. While it's a great idea because it is a win-win for both the company and the consumer, social distancing that I expect to be the norm in the next few months will definitely harm this.\n\nAt the end of the day, you might think twice when you're sharing a Toyota Camry back seat with 3 random drunk people in the middle of the night.\n\nOther growth area I've always considered big for shared drives are the business people segment. Thinking of it, UBER solves a great problem with all this business travel where you don't have to think about renting a car/trying to get a cab in places you don't know - you call your UBER as soon as you land, knowing that its waiting for you. And since you are not paying for it, you will call the premium car whatever the distance.\n\nProblem is, most businesses that require travel such as consulting/advisory, finance etc., will not be going anywhere at least until September.  I do think intra country business travel will be reduced greatly, and shared drive is going to get affected.\n\n**4) UBER EATS potential**\n\nThis one is really an open discussion. The reason why I am skeptical about this one is that this that I think economies of scale is much harder here. Again, I think pooling is the greatest thing from a shared drive company perspective, but it is not as simple to implement the same for UBER EATS as the normal riding.\n\nWhile your algorithm can certainly identify two orders in close vicinity so your driver can drop both of these, this one is much more time sensitive than pooling for shared drive. At at the end of day, you may be ok to wait in the car listening to your music while the person before you is being dropped off, you will not wait the driver to drop off your food in 3 different places (and he has to get off the car, go to the door, find the apt etc.) as you dont want a have cold pizza delivered in 50 mins.\n\nWhile EATS might have partnership with big chains, some of them will definitely create their own platforms (such as Domino's) as they will be much more efficient than you can ever be. Add on top this, the cost burden to restaurants who are not happy, the competition from all sorts of apps and so on.\n\nThe key thing here is while you may want to get into an UBER car for its convenience/premium thing, you probably do not care how your food is delivered, i.e. some random dude in Toyota Camry or in a Cadillac Escalade. Therefore you don't have the same convenience/loyalty/premium service aspect here in EATS, all of a sudden there is no customer stickiness at all. Yes you still collect loyalty points, but given their fees and and tips, do you want to get your food cheaper or not? You are sitting your home anyway so it does not matter how things are delivered in the background.\n\nAnd finally, if you cant be profitable from EATS during COVID or day 1, how sustainable is that business model as there is no real economies of scale as I mentioned earlier.\n\nTLDR: UBER Puts for Q2/Q3 timeframe when the market realizes growth by itself cannot be separated from the business model.", "created_utc": 1588986487.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gg5tum/uber_financial_statements_and_outlook_dd/", "is_self": true}
