About a month ago, I was down to about 28k. Then I decided that all I really needed was one good yolo and I'll be back to green all time. Well SPY was approaching ATH at the time (around 294), so I figured that it was pretty obviously going back down.\n\nMy philosophy is that if you're going to open a position, you need to be confident enough to go all-in. And if you're confident enough to go all-in, then might as well do so. Now it only follows that if you're so confident in a direction, might as well do 1-day expiries to get max tendies. (This is also why I almost exclusively trade SPY, more 1-day expiries). So that's what I did.\n\nWell in the past month SPY broke ATH's again, and I kept losing on my positions (either call credit spreads or puts). I was down to about 1.2k last Thursday. About then I realized I wasn't going to make it back, so I did what anyone else would do in my position: make another deposit. I pulled the last $5k from my savings and dumped it into RH. Friday morning, I was under 4k.\n\nI got bailed out by China cancelling some agriculture visit or some shit which got me back to almost $10k. Call credit spreads expiring Monday got me back to just under $15k. By now I've learned my lesson and set a rule for myself: Don't buy one-day options. So I went long-term and bought puts expiring Friday instead of Wednesday, and also sold some further OTM puts expiring Wednesday as a sort of hedge. Well as we all know, SPY tanked a lot on Tuesday (would've been up to $50k by then without the hedges but oh well). I spammed a bunch of put credit spreads about an hour before close (370 total). I ended the day at about $30k.\n\nSo now it's Wednesday, and I close everything out because it's hard for me to keep track of more than one position (I don't know if I should think uppies or downies when staring at the screen). Closed everything about 36k (the put credit spreads had lost a bit of value). So now I was about back to where I started at before my yoloing. I figured that maybe this is a good time to stop. I remembered some other autist saying costco is gonna be huge in China, so I figured I might as well buy long-term calls for the ER. Ended the day at $40k because of the PPT pump at the end.\n\nWell this morning COST was down 0.6%, and I was actually only down like 5% on the calls overall. Now I looked at SPY, and it was down about 0.5%. In my bearish days I would have seen this as capitulation and go all-in on puts. But I then remembered that being a bear was not very cash money, and that stocks really only go up. So I sold my COST calls went all-in on SPY calls expiring tomorrow. Now this was a flagrant violation of my no 1-day expiry rule, but I figured that since it was a 100% play, it was a reasonable exception. Was down to $26k at one point, but closed for a nice 40% gain at $48k, making me green all-time. Now I'm all-in on iron condors 292/294 and 299/301 expiring tomorrow.\n\nI've learned two big lessons from my plays this past week.\n\n1. Don't self-impose any restrictions - wouldn't have made the gains today if I followed my rules.\n2. Hedging is for pussies - if I didn't hedge by selling OTM puts on Tuesday, I would be about $20k richer now.\n\nNever stop depositing. If you blow up your account, pulling out won't make you the money back. If you lose big, you'll eventually win big. And once you lose enough, you will be able to feel the market, and you stop losing.\n\nThank you for coming to my TED talk.\n\nDisclaimer: [https://xkcd.com/1827/](https://xkcd.com/1827/)", "created_utc": 1569531749, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d9pvxs/to_hell_and_back_again_the_autistic_dante/", "is_self": true}
