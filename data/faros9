And now  you\u2019re a sad shell of your once glorious existence? Want to start making money again? If you answered yes to any of these questions, follow these next two plays. $INTC puts, $50 or lower expiring next Friday or the Friday after. Not only is Intel selling off like everyone else, they are in one of the hardest hit sectors. Above all, their next gen processors are benchmarking at similar levels to AMD\u2019s current gen. While costing more I might add. This is due to intel still using 10nm technology that is inferior in every way compared to AMD 7nm. This gap in capacitor density is only going to widen when AMD hits 5nm next year. Not only that, they are losing market share in every segment, commercial servers, custom, hedt, gaming, etc. AMD also has the silicon wafer advantage due to TSMC. Lastly, $EXPE puts expiring same time as the last, at $90. Nearing all time lows in a all time correction. On top of that , the correction itself will specifically harm Expedia as travel will lessen. Your still a bull, just one that is experimenting with cock in the ass while you figure yourself out. Remember this, having gay sex once is pretty gay, but doing it all year like a gay bear is really fucking gay. Therefore bulls are still less gay. In all seriousness, you should look at this massive correction as a huge advantage. It\u2019s literally the same as buying calls, but with more gains as the crash ha sheen so drastic.
