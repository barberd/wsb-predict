If anyone else has been watching GSX, you'll notice the stock behaves almost exactly the same every single day. It shoots up in a straight line at open, then comes back down to either a bit above open or goes into the red.  Not sure if this is some sort of CCP manipulation (CHINA! probably doesn't want another LK), short squeeze, or something else.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo the strategy seems easy, wait for the initial pump, buy some puts a month or two out (just to be safe, cowardly i know), sell for a solid 20-30% profit, repeat. EXCEPT, the real reason to play this stock is waiting for the inevitable day when it drops 90%+ overnight, leading to lots of $$$. Premiums are pricy on these options for sure, but they don't lose too much value even when the underlying rockets up 5-10% in a day, everyone seems to know the implosion is a question of when, not if.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow are other people playing this?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrent positions:\n\n$25p 7/17 x3 (currently +21.5%)\n\n$35p 7/17 x10 (currently -9.92%)\n\n$15p 10/16 x44 (currently +30.72%)", "created_utc": 1591514818.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gy7xoy/gsx_techedu_china/", "is_self": true}
