{"id": "es4ebf", "title": "Earnings and IV Crush", "selftext": "A lot of new faces here so I thought I\u2019d let you gays know what the fuck is up. \n\nOkay, imagine a stock is that hot dick you matched with on Grindr.  For this example, you\u2019re trying to get that McDonald\u2019s dick (MCD).  You\u2019re chatting and he says he wants to meet to give you that MCD on 1/28.  You\u2019re fucking pumped, I mean this dude has everything and his pics are amazing.  1/28 is the day it happens and what a glorious dick-down you\u2019ll receive on that day.  This is the (earnings) date.  \n\nFor the next couple weeks, your dick is pumpin harder every minute with anticipation of a pink sock from your fuck boi.  Your tiny pp growing is also known as implied volatility (IV).  It grows substantially before the MCD (earnings) date. \n\nFast forward to 1/28. You\u2019re so god damn excited, you\u2019re walking around with rager like a kid that just saw his parents fucking.  And then it happens, you finally see your Grindr date at 4:15 pm.  Now, something terrible happens to your libido; it drops. Why? Well, as my father used to say - \u201cbehind every hot guy, is a guy tired of fucking him.\u201d  Your little pen cap is crushed (IV) and flaccid.  \n\nApproximately 2 weeks before ER, the IV starts climbing and will immediately crush after the report.  This is inevitable.  If you don\u2019t understand why, try looking up the definition of IMPLIED.  \n\nSo how do you use protection with your soy boy to ensure you get as much MCD as possible?\n\nBuy 2 weeks before and hope it goes in your direction, sell right before earnings. And not a day or two, minutes before.  Straddles work well too. \n\nSay you forgot about the MCD and you want to get in day of?  The safest play would be iron condors or flys to collect some premium.  The next best play is selling contracts but those could end horribly.  And finally, you could straddle.  With this play, you\u2019re hoping the intrinsic value offsets your FOMO autistic ass.\n\nWhat happens the day after you get that delicious clown dick?  The IV is minimal so you could hop in with very cheap premium and ride any post ER wave, guilt free. \n\nStop asking why your yolo FDs are worthless the next day.  They\u2019re worthless because you\u2019re worthless and you got dicked down by a big red Grindr Penis.", "created_utc": 1579655261, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/es4ebf/earnings_and_iv_crush/", "is_self": true}
