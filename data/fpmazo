I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be a violent drop like the one we recently saw, or more than likely it will, but in order to do so it\u2019ll have to break pass the support level of $241. I think we'll see a re-test of the $222 support level in the upcoming days.\n\nFundamentally speaking, this recent rally (dead cat bounce) won\u2019t last.\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\nEDIT -\n\nTL;DR\n[SPY $245p 4/3](https://ibb.co/dfJ1ykM)", "created_utc": 1585265939.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpmazo/spider_price_retracement/", "is_self": true}
