It could keep going up or down.  But the fact that I have some choice in my own financial well-being is so eye-opening.  I didn\u2019t have to suck dick or put on a happy voice (I work in a call center) to a rude piece of shit.  I just had to research and make the best decision I could with the knowledge that I have.\n\nIt\u2019s not much.  In fact these are the first options I\u2019ve ever bought.  But to know that this alternative exists actually made me enjoy my shift more today.  To know that I can set my own goals and take my own risks in a way that does not requiring appeasing other people.\n\nIt may be unrealistic to think I could retire in 5 years (at age 35), but sometimes the possibility alone can change your outlook on life, even if it\u2019s unlikely.", "created_utc": 1581383307, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f20hb8/i_made_more_on_msft_and_spce_today_than_i_did/", "is_self": true}
