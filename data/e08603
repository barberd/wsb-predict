In one day they went up to $126.00 because this guy had sent me an email. I need more help on which Stocks to buy that will hike up that much. \n\nI'm thinking of buying CRK (Comstock Resourcing Inc) because I heard Jerry Jones has a big stake in them. He's the owner of the Cowboys Football Team. And I heard he has something to do with Chesapeake Going bankrupt. \n\nAny advice?", "created_utc": 1574460168, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e08603/which_stocks_to_buy_that_are_cheap_hello/", "is_self": true}
