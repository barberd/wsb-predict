I am here to say its Earnings report dip is bullshit.\n\nGLUU destroyed their earnings report despite the original perception... **Year-Over-Year, their total assets are up 14%, their total bookings, up 7%, their Ad bookings up 32 freaking % and get this.... their Year-Over-Year Revenue... 18%...**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor me at least, GLUU is hitting all the right triggers and there were perceived poorly in their earnings report because they did not beat the high expectations they were given by a handful of analysts.\n\nThey have 3 more anticipated games coming out within the next 4 months that have all said to be positively reviewed in Beta testing as well as 2 more original IPs coming out next year. \n\nAs the trends have shown over their past few ER's (good or bad) they take roughly 1-2 months before skyrocketing again. For example, their last ER on Feb. 5th... Between Feb. 5th and Apr. 5th, **their stock rose over** **28%**. ($2.51) \n\nAgain, between Oct. 30th and Dec. 31st, **their stock rose over 18%** ($1.24) \n\nAnd AGAIN, between July 26th and Sept. 26th, it **shot up 27.5%** ($1.59) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe proof is in the pudding folks and this pudding is 18% off right now... I want to buy both a few shares as well as some $12 calls probably expiring June within the next few trading days (after this tariff bullshit blows over and I sell my remaining calls/puts) unless there is something in the market that would heavily disrupt this industry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll see y'all at the moon with my McDonalds Happy Meal in 2 months.", "created_utc": 1557291201, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bm13mv/why_i_am_buying_gluu_and_you_should_too/", "is_self": true}
