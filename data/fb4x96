Check the chart, ALL FUCKING DAY this thing is fine. I\u2019m watching it up till the last minute. I should\u2019ve closed the position but I just figured it\u2019ll expire in the green and I\u2019ll get paid. Nope. Some bullshit happened in the last 1 minute there you can see it on the amzn 1 day chart; it shot over 1880. Well fuck me in the nuts right? Now me being a fucking peak autist I had no idea what this entailed, but I assumed I was now on the hook for 1.88 million dollars of amazon stock. Told my wife and of course she was debating murdering me or divorcing me or both. Call my broker and he asks like 20 people in his office and confirms i can buy to over first thing Monday morning during premarket. Presumably making my loss $10k, you know instead of 1.88million. Well don\u2019t be like me, always close your fucking positions because this market is a rigged son of a bitch and will fuck you every time: \n\nProof of position https://imgur.com/a/gPVI8dM", "created_utc": 1582938788, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fb4x96/always_close_out_your_green_positions_before/", "is_self": true}
