What I am is a 300lb neckbeard that loves the show Billions, cries at the end of Wolf of Wallstreet, and comments on Pornhub videos. But anyway\u2026I\u2019ll be using AMD due to the bull gang love and CGC cause some autist is giving out wrong info, don\u2019t buy that shit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**RSI:**\n\nDafuq is RSI? Well\u2026it stands for Relative Strength Index\u2026and Wikipedia says it\u2019s \u201ca momentum indicator that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the price of a stock.\u201d For our purposes here, think of it as just one word, **Momentum**. We can look at the momentum of a stock based on specific criteria, 250 days and 10 days and select times to buy and sell contracts of said stock. This generally works on a 1day \u2013 5minute chart. I like to day trade options, scalp, take my tendies, hit up Wendy\u2019s\u2026dat baconator nawmean. *Find what works best for your trading style*.\n\n\\*RSI | 250-day Indicator\\*\n\nThink of this as the \u201coverall\u201d momentum of the stock.  RSI is used for overbought/oversold positions and floats between 30-70. For our trading, think of 50 as our indicator line. Anything above is a \u201cbullish\u201d stock and anything below is a \u201cbearish\u201d stock.\n\nBullish: AMD \u2013  [https://imgur.com/a/sbTXDb7](https://imgur.com/a/sbTXDb7) \n\nBearshit: CGC \u2013 [https://imgur.com/a/nI2BTpd](https://imgur.com/a/nI2BTpd) \n\nThis shows the long-term trend of the stock, rather it\u2019s on fire or crashing like Pier 1 imports. As you can see AMD is bullish and well, I will repeat don\u2019t by that shit CGC yet options wise (until it hits the below stuff, the call the fuck out of it).\n\n\\*RSI | 10-day Indicator\\*\n\nThe 10-day chart shows your entry and exist points (look to call / look to put) for potentially gaining max profit.\n\nSimilar to the 50 line for the 250-day indicator, we\u2019re looking at the 30 and 60 lines for the 10-day chart.\n\nTreasure Map: AMD - [https://imgur.com/a/K12HIkG](https://imgur.com/a/K12HIkG) \n\nAs you can see, usually charts come around after the 30 and 6 levels. So for buying calls, watch for the stock to drop below 30 and then place a put on the loop-around back once it crosses 30 again. Ride it up as long as you want, but once it crosses 60, I sell the option, rather ITM, ATM, or OTM.\n\nSame for puts, but inverse, put at the 2nd 60 line , exist at the first 30 line break.\n\nHopefully you\u2019ll profit. I even added in some puts to show the bear gang some luv. &lt;3 fap n nap\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**MACD:**\n\nNow that you\u2019re an expert options ~~trader~~ autist at RSI, let\u2019s move to MACD\u2026I like to call it the MacDaddy. But really, MACD stands for Moving Average Convergence Divergence and it\u2019s a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security's price. For our purposes, none of that shit matters, we\u2019re looking for X marks the spot on calls or puts.\n\nThis one is simple, use the 50 line as your baseline (similar to RSI 250) with 12 and 26 as your settings. Anytime the moving averages cross (make an X) above the 50 line, that\u2019s usually a sign to put, if below the 50 line, that\u2019s usually a call option.\n\nExample: [https://imgur.com/a/C9KdtDm](https://imgur.com/a/C9KdtDm) \n\nMake sure you review the chart overall, look at the amount of time it took to move $X amount. Based on your dollar movement estimate for either calls or puts, always multiple by 10. For example, if a stock is $11, and I put a call for $13, I wouldn\u2019t want to cut myself short, so I\u2019d get a call that\u2019s about 20 days out ($2 x 10 = 20) Jesus titty fucking Christ break out the calculator already and do your own math.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**GAP:** \n\nMy personal favorite and I\u2019m not talking about the GAP between my eyebrows either, thanks genetics. Fucking 2020 caveman over here. Anyway\u2026\n\nI like it cause it\u2019s easy and narrows down my choices for what to call or put. I look at stocks that gapped up or down and use the above RSI and MacDaddy to see if it\u2019s at a good entry point. If all 3 stars align, viola, you\u2019ll be driving a cybertruck in no time.\n\nExample GAP: [https://imgur.com/a/peLJBTk](https://imgur.com/a/peLJBTk) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Parting words of wisdom:**\n\n\\- It\u2019s a marathon, not a race\n\n\\- No one went broke locking in profits\n\n\\- Don\u2019t be greedy, build you stack once option at a time\n\n\\- F for the Bear gang\n\nLuv, \n\nFap-n-Nap", "created_utc": 1578544897, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/em4qnr/autist_trading_with_rsi_macd_and_gap/", "is_self": true}
