It\u2019s been fun watching y\u2019all lose money in this kangaroo market, meanwhile I\u2019m up 300% on SPACs. Anyway the next play no one is talking about is on the forefront of the Green Revolution. \n\nThe company PureCycle has developed a recycling technology that allows it to remove odor and color from polypropyelene plastic to produce virgin plastics. This is one of the most most common plastics in the world, and this development means that plastic companies can now reuse their products indefinitely. \n\nNestle has already signed a deal to partner with them. GRAF is the ticker for the SPAC looking to take them public. While not confirmed yet, warrants are still trading for $1.40 right now. If confirmed, this is a 10 bagger.\n\nGo Green, go bet on recycling", "created_utc": 1593113536.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hfshu8/big_green_bet_on_recycling_purecycle/", "is_self": true}
