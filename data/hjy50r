As an example, try following the 50x bagger option list that's always published weekly  in wsb, R:R is > 1:50, but following them would've made you lose money, because ... the probability of it occuring is  < 1:1000. Get the point ? Similarly, the chances of SPY hitting 320 within next Friday is in my view less then 3%. So with that this play will actually give you probability adjusted 1/12 \\* 33 \\~ 1 : 3 Risk:Reward ratio, not bad huh ? \n\nAnd those of you saying why not sell puts, better premiums ? That's like selling car insurance in the parking lot of a dive bar to a guy who just had a case of budlight with several DUIs to his name already (aka our current QE drunk market). Besides if you plan to do a credit spread, the net premium is not that far off.\n\nYou might be wondering what are  my qualifications to rant on all this ? Well any retard can get a phd in math and then work for Citadel or Bridgewater, however I'm the same guy that brought you these memes.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hhyozc/bulls\\_on\\_the\\_wsb\\_boat/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hhyozc/bulls_on_the_wsb_boat/) \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/himde3/the\\_last\\_sub\\_standing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/himde3/the_last_sub_standing/)\n\nMaking meme's for WSB without shelling out for cameos is like one of the most intellectually challenging thing in the world, hence I must have big brains. Now going into Independence day weekend, we will hear much market pump talk from politicians promising the ocean,moon and stars all in one pork belly package bill. It's just talk, you may choose to get in on Monday for a chance of slightly higher premium price, but end result is the same by 7/10 the 320C will expire worthless.\n\nSo again retards if you don't hate tendies, for next week do this \n\nSPY SELL 320C 7/10 \n\nSPY BUY 325C 7/10  (Optional leg for credit spread)\n\nAs I'm concluding, the SPY is swarming up, and Trump is due for a press conf but have faith autist the \ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udc3b force protects !\n\n**(However check back regularly, if I tell you to close your position then GTFO)**", "created_utc": 1593700541.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hjy50r/fear_the_walking_dead_spy_zombie_markets_iv/", "is_self": true}
