You had bought the grande meal the night before, but after your $69 AMD FDs rose 25% on the day, you decided to jack off and hit the hay before you could finish. You have 3 tacos left, you turn on the news because it makes you feel more like you know what you\u2019re doing and less like the taco crumb-covered autist you are. A female news reporter is talking about something. She has big tits. They remind you of your mum\u2019s. You watch them for a while. With two tacos left, you look away from her tits. Behind her you see images of Wall Street. There are graphs drawn with a colour you\u2019ve never seen before. You start to listen. She says something about the biggest correction since 2008. Your dad had still been around back then. You haven\u2019t seen him since. Your child support payments were beyond his personal risk tolerance. The big-tit lady looks at the camera. She asks, \u201ccould this be the first day in the next recession?\u201d  *Uh oh*. You know that word. The R word. Not the R word that kids used to call you at school; the other one; the one that means bad thing are happening. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou start to panic. You manage a \u201cguh\u201d as you scramble for your phone. It\u2019s on 7%. You had been to lazy to reach 2 feet to plug it in before you collapsed into a taco induced slumber. It\u2019s an iPhone. You feel a glow of superiority over those plebeian Android cucks. The glass on the back is badly cracked. A loose shard of iPhone glass cuts your finger. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou try to unlock the phone, but your greasy fingers don\u2019t register. You try to wipe the grease off on your bloated stomach, but it\u2019s covered in taco crumbs. You lick the grease off and wipe your wet fingers on your ass. They smell, buy you manage to unlock your phone. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou open RobinHood. It looks angry. Your AMD FDs are down 82%. Your SPY weeklies are down 90%. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou pull open WallStreetBets. *Trusted WSB, they\u2019ll know what\u2019s happening.* You see a user who had commented \u201cBull Gang 4 Lyfe\u201d in your AMD TENDIES thread  last night. He has just commented \u201cBull= Shit. Bear gang till I die.\u201d You call him out. He calls you a faggot. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYour eyes are wide as you scroll through hundreds of panicking threads. *Fuck.* You realise that you still haven\u2019t closed your positions. You rush back to Robin Hood. Those naked SPY puts a WSBer had convinced you to sell are nowhere to be found. *What\u2019s a \u2018Margin Call?\u2019 you wonder*. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYour TSLA calls are up 35%. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYour phone rings. It\u2019s an unfamiliar number. You don\u2019t answer. You toss some tendies in the microwave, but for some reason they just don\u2019t taste the same. You call your mum in tears. She calls you a faggot. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou sigh. There\u2019s only one thing to do.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou log onto WSB, and post a new thread. The words come slowly, they\u2019re still alien to you, but at last your post is ready.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u201cSPY puts are literally free money. BEAR GANG WHOS UP\u201d\n\nYou feel bad, but comments start to roll in. Bear after bear offers their approval. You feel a warm glow. The sun is still shining. In some ways things have changed, but at heart they\u2019re still the same.", "created_utc": 1579600974, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ersk91/its_march_1st_the_sun_is_shining_and_the_bulls_on/", "is_self": true}
