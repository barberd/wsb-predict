How to make money when the day is doing nothing.", "selftext": "Previous post:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6y9be/hooray\\_a\\_return\\_to\\_our\\_tea\\_roots\\_large\\_scale/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6y9be/hooray_a_return_to_our_tea_roots_large_scale/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, today was a pretty light volume day. 84M on SPY by EOD. The daily thread was chock full of \"losing money doing nothing\" type comments, so I thought we'd spend some time on how to make money when your options are decaying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLets start with the basics:\n\nIf you start a day with 5 puts for $220 SPY. You notice that the day doesn't seem to be doing much of anything. The closer you are to the date of your options expiry date, the more Theta decay will affect them. An excellent question to pose to yourself:\n\nIf I didn't already have the position I'm in, would I buy based the same setup right now based on current information, current price, and current projection? If the answer to ANY of those is no, then sell. You can rebuy the SAME POSITION end of day if you want back in, and you'll prolly save money (unless your brokerage charges for options, in which case you'll have to measure it).\n\nMy example hypothesis:\n\nTommorow will be bigly red. I buy puts with an expiry of 4 days out, so that I have time to unload my position if it doesn't work out.\n\nTomorrow comes, and the day is a stall 1 hour into it. Well, the most volatile hours of the day are the first and the last, and not much happened. I surmise that today will actually be a nothing day, but tomorrow is a blood red day for sure. What do I do at 10:30am? I close the position. If my theory is still my theory at 3/3:30, I won't have spent all day paying for decay just to be the one hanging on to the option.\n\nHow could this fuck me? Well, if you saw a massive increase in volatility, than buying it back is going to be more expensive. On the other hand, if volatility is going crazy, its much more likely that something will actually happen, so theres that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you know that holding options all day makes them decrease in value, you have to ask yourself something basic. Who profits when options decay? The seller. Now they have an asset to cover that isn't worth as much as they got for it. The difference between the cover and the sell prices are your profit. It is theoretically capped, as a stock (so far!) can't go below $0.\n\nNow lets talk about how you make profits off options strategies, the straddle and the strangle.\n\nThe Long straddle.\n\nThe long straddle makes money when the underlying stock moves in a direction. The more it moves, the more you make. You don't have to know which direction its moving, but it needs to move. You lose money on a straddle to decay just like everyone else. 2x the decay(s) actually, so these are not long term holds. If your long straddle doesn't move on a slow day, you'll out the decay of your premium equal to the decay of your theta and delta (time and volatility). You can still make some money back sometimes selling at the EoD, 1530-1600 by selling when the volatility is normally a bit higher. Note: this will rarely MAKE you money on a slow day. This is a strategy that you open by BUYING a call and a put with the same expiration date, and the same strike. \"limitless\" profit, defined maximum loss (the cost of your premiums).\n\nThe Short straddle.\n\nMost things here are the opposite of the long. For starters, lets be clear. Your profit is 100% limited to the cost of the premiums you sold them for. What does that mean? Well, lets make one thing real big and clear. IF A LONG STRADDLE HAS INFINITE PROFIT POTENTIAL, THAN A SHORT HAS INFINITE LOSS POTENTIAL. Short straddles should be a bit more managed because of this fact. If your theory is wrong, you need to get out. How does a short straddle work? Well, you sell a call and a put (still same date, still same price). The buyer holds on to them, and the greek decay starts to eat his premiums. If the market doesn't move in a way to make them profitable, the decrease in premium value goes into the pockets of the person who sold them. How do you play these? The opposite of the long. You buy and hold for decay. If you want to increase your earnings potential with these, you buy while Delta (volatility) is high ,because it will have more 'premium' value to decay. I will warn against this, because if volatility is high, it is much more likely that it could spike away from you, and you could lose a lot of money. If you buy and sell these during low volatility times, you'll make less, but also risk less. If you want to make more money on these, my advice is to scale (open more safe positions rather than taking fewer higher-reward/riskier positions. I also like to close mine at 3pm, because I can avoid end of day volatility, and the risk they might walk away from me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBecause you want to make money off of movement, or lack of it, I prefer to buy the above strategies when the current market position is at a high-liquid strike price, such as 280, or 275. If you have to buy one that is off-center a bit, realize your profit may be a bit off-center too. In addition, some of the less popular strike prices (282/3 vs 285) generally have less volume, so getting in/out can be more problematic, which could fuck up your gains. These are generally \"pattern\" independent strategies (meaning buy whenever, as long as you're close to what you think the \"center\" time is), as long as the general trend period (Up and down over X time frame) is low. If there is a lot of rapid up-down 3-4 points, like a horizontal zipper, it indicates that there is more volatility, so purchase accordingly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLong Strangle\n\nThe long strangle is similar to the long straddle. What is the primary different? You don't buy identical strike prices for your call/put (still same expiration). So Market position is lets say, 250. You buy a call for 255, and a put for 245, so you have a Range of 10. Because the current market price is 250, and you bought away from the current market price, your premiums will be a little bit cheaper. However, you will have a 'dead zone'. 245 to 255 is no man's land for you, if the underlying doesn't move out of that range, your options will expire worthless. Because of this, the cheaper price, you need a greater movement. The upside is that your gains are still potentially infinite. The downsides are that you have a dead zone, and you're still rocking 2x the amount of decay from theta and delta, so you need the movement to be fast enough to beat the loss to decay. I really never buy this strategy, as I'm not a fan of its extra complications.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShort Strangle\n\nLike the Short straddle, this strategy makes money off of decay. The difference between the long and the short, is that you ONLY profit when the market price exists in the space \"between\" your strike prices, which was previously the only place we DIDN'T make money. The dead-man-zone is the money maker on the short. I think a short strangle can be easier to make modest returns because the dead-zone gives you more flexibility, but your gains will be smaller. One thing to remember, these can have the same inversed \"limitless loss\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne thing you might ask, how can I reduce my risk from this \"infinite loss\" potentiality? Cover your short by buying 100 shares (per straddle/strangle sold) of the underlying asset when you open the position. This can obviously get expensive, but the maximum risk you have at that point is the cost of your shares. If the strangle's legs expire worthless (because the option didn't move in price, and decay ate away the value until expiry), you still have 100 shares and you can do it again! (if you believe the same theory to remain true). Or, sell the shares for whatever difference in price for a smaller profit/loss.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/ouZ0jdg.png](https://i.imgur.com/ouZ0jdg.png)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo 85m volume today, pretty weak. These minor movements definitely make me think we're getting ready for a big move, and I'd still bet downward. One thing to understand, is that the 2nd legs down are not always as big as the first. We may find some of these attempts to 'fix' things do indeed shorten the length of our next leg down. Really, my hope (except for ma tendies) is that they build a staircase to keep the crash from being too severe. And actually, I think people will make more money in total if there are steps down, because they'll have more opportunity to flip out of bad positions and more opportunity to try and get a slice of the down than if its all over in 1/2 days.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/HIPu0tN.png](https://i.imgur.com/HIPu0tN.png)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf we look at the above (crash of 29) , we can see the efforts following the big crash bar take MONTHS (each bar is 1 month on that chart) to get to the 2nd crash phase. While some things may happen quicker, we can't be sure. The crash of 29 took 3 bars to crash, and 5 bars to recover (over the dead cat, and on to the 2nd leg of the fall). If we use the same math for the 2020 crash, that it took 5 weeks to crash, it could take 8 weeks (we're currently in week 5, so 3 weeks left) to get to our second leg. The recession in 2016 was 4 bars to crash, 6 to get to the 2nd leg, and the 2007 crash was roughly 22 weeks down, 10 up, to get to the new leg. Though if I'm being honest, 2007 was a wavy messy crash. It had closer to 4 legs down than 1down /deadcat /1down. We may be in store for a few more weeks of this sorta \"maybe?\" slow nothing days like today.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLastly, I'll address a topic a few people post about regularly in complaints.\n\nI will likely never post gains and losses porn. I am not interested in feeding the hopes and dreams of the lottery seekers, or making those who have already lost their pots feel bad about their failures. I've had days making decent (but not crazy) gains with straddles, and also days where I lost a bit too.\n\nI spent this morning trading (1) share of spy with some new indicators, on a few different timetables. I made a whopping $1.01 testing some new stuff, but I was profitable in 66% of my trades, which I was happy about.\n\nI hope the information you might take away from my long winded ass posts is useful, and maybe keeps you from an early death. Remember, you need money for the climb. If you make some decent gains before then, that's pretty cool too. Happy hunting autists.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl:dr Words, More boring words, Magic 8 ball says: Spy 69P 4/24/20", "created_utc": 1587768202.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7ibxy/the_tea_leaves_are_more_irrational_today_than/", "is_self": true}
