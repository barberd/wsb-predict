You buy some juicy puts, you\u2019re thinking \u201coh hell yeah, this is my last $37 but I\u2019m an Oracle and I know that the unemployment numbers are 3x what they expect.\u201d Easy money right? Wrong. Jpow\u2019s burner phone buzzes. Why? A text message.\n\nWhat does that text message say? \u201cSomeone just bet against you big J\u201d\n\nNow Big J isn\u2019t going to stand for that, so he calls up George Soros and next thing you know it, markets green.\n\nNow this all makes sense, if I was JPow I\u2019d do the same shit. But here\u2019s where the market is rigged.\n\nYour puts are now -50%. JPow thinks he was a little harsh, so tomorrow he decides to let the markets pull back and give you your money back.\n\nHe thinks, \u201cAh he is down 50%, I\u2019ll make his puts go back up the 50% he lost.\u201d\n\nBut if you run the numbers. That doesn\u2019t bring your account back to green at all, in fact you\u2019ll still be down 25%! So jpow actually needed to let your account double.\n\nDoes that even make sense??? You lose half, and gain half and you\u2019re still down? It\u2019s all rigged. You literally can\u2019t make money in this shit.\n\nAnyways, SPY $69p 4/20", "created_utc": 1585238107.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpdwh0/stock_market_is_rigged_and_heres_why/", "is_self": true}
