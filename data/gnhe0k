{"id": "gnhe0k", "title": "SE is a strong buy", "selftext": "* Very strong growth (\\~170% YOY) in one of the fastest growing regions in the world. Good leadership, products, and relatively diversified revenue streams.\n* Running a comp with Shopify shows it has higher revenue, stronger growth and more diversified, yet less than half the valuation\n* SE is equipped to become an industry leader. Southeast Asia and Brazil are interestingly one of the highest engaged phone users in the world (more on this later).\n\nSea limited has three products in three industries.\n\nThe first is games. They own Free Fire which is the most downloaded game this year in the app store. The games section contributes about half their revenue.\n\nThe next two are growing at a very rapid rate. It is their ecommerce site Shopee as well as Sea Money, which is an online banking/wallet in Southeast Asia. Both are growing at very rapid rates [https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/05/18/sea-limited-se-q1-2020-earnings-call-transcript.aspx](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/05/18/sea-limited-se-q1-2020-earnings-call-transcript.aspx)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSoutheast Asia is a place you want to be invested in for the next 10 to 20 years.

All of SE's products are directly tapping into this growth, and it faces little competition in expanding all three of their revenue streams, although I am more interested in Shopee and SeaMoney.\n\nIf you want to do more research, I found these videos really insightful.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0svmVGfqBWk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0svmVGfqBWk)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUbwvREnVhU&t=1977s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUbwvREnVhU&t=1977s)\n\nI have 400 shares in SE.
