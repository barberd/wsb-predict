The company has been trying to boost sales by burning through cash to get celebrities for advertisement and giving out basically FREE fucking coffee (I've seen 90% discount before). The company is no where near competitive comparing against Starbucks in China.\n\nHell the company is also trying to sell its brand on how good its coffee is, but the sad truth is that 90% of people that go to Starbucks in China are there for frappes and to look fansy.\n\nAs a matter fact people in China are laughing at the fact that LK was able to raise so much capital from the US market. Just go look at their profit and cash flow. It's insane how American investor think this shit is worth over a billion", "created_utc": 1585845697.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ftpme3/why_is_lk_so_high_in_the_first_place/", "is_self": true}
