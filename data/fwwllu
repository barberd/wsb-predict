I'm sure everyone here knows what Target is and does so lets get into it.\n\nLooking at their 2018 10-k (that's the most recent one? help fuzzy) Target has $41.29B in assets which consist of 1844 properties, 1525 of which are owned, 161 are leased, and 158 are owned on leased land. 40 of those are distribution centers. \n\nAs of 2/2019 they have $1.556B in cash on hand, down $1.1B from 2017's $2.64B due to $1B in share repurchases and store upgrades.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Revenue** has increased $2.7B or 3.7% from $72.7B in 2017 to $75.35B in 2018, yet \n\n**Net Income** has only increased \\~$30million.\n\nFrom what I can tell, this is because their **profit margin** are getting tighter. They had a 6.9% profit margin in 2016, now it's down to 5.5% in 2018.\n\n**EBITDA** decreased from $6.75B in 2017 to $6.61B in 2018. What does that mean? No really, what the fuck does that mean?\n\n**Dividends** for 2018 are (were) $2.54 per share\n\n**Earnings per share** have risen from $4.69 in 2016 to $5.29 in 2017 and $5.51 in 2018.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Target seems to be buying shares back pretty aggressively**\n\nin 2017 TGT bought 17.6m shares @ $58.44/share totaling $1.02B in buyback, in 2018 TGT bought 27.2m shares @ $75.88/share for $2.06B\n\nThis is probably a good sign to go long on them alone, but what do I know?\n\n***Their debt is as follows***\n\nTarget took on $1B in debt @ 2.5% interest due 4/2026 and $1B @ 3.625% interest due 4/2046. They also took out $750m @ 3.9% due 11/2047. It looks like they repurchased or paid back $344m in debt in 2017 actual cost was $463m and took a $123m loss. \n\nthey have a $2.5B revolving credit line that originally ended 10/2022 but was extended 1 year to 10/2023. \n\nLong term debt (LTD) and Contractual Obligations (CO) \n\n<1 year $1.002B LTD/ $2.95B CO\n\n1-3 years $2.15B LTD/ $3.885B CO \n\n3-5 years $63m LTD/ $1.58B CO\n\n\\>5 years $7.121B LTD/ $14.822B CO\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Required Principal Payments** \n\n2020- $1.094B \n\n2021- $1.056B\n\n2022- $63m\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR  $TGT has a good amount of cash on hand, their revenue has continued to climb year after year, net income is around $2.9B. They have to pay $1.09B in loan principal payments in 2020, $1.05B and 2021, then only $63m in 2022 which given revenue and income seems easily doable. They took a hit just like almost everyone else but I think they will be fine. **$TGT 1/2021 110c** maybe wait until next week to buy since we seem to be at the tail end of a rally.", "created_utc": 1586307270.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fwwllu/i_was_inspired_by_our_dad_fuzzy_and_upon_my_wifes/", "is_self": true}
