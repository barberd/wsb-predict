{"id": "bk58q1", "title": "Qualcomm (2) vs FTC (0)", "selftext": " Justice Department asks for hearing in Qualcomm antitrust case\n\nSo we good. DOJ said if a rule hit Qualcomm hard it would harm competition because only few left with 5g in other countries. And ofc from a national security point for the USA. The apple Settlement also put a damper on FTC case. Qualcomm will fly high when FTC settle/dismis.\n\n\"(T)here is a plausible prospect that an overly broad remedy in this case could reduce competition and innovation in markets for 5G technology and downstream applications that rely on that technology,\" the Justice Department wrote. \"Such an outcome could exceed the appropriate scope of an equitable antitrust remedy. Moreover, it has the distinct potential to harm rather than help competition.\"\n\nQualcomm stock will jump to the moon. Apple Settlement Qualcomm scored 1-0. Now its 2-0.\n\nIf you see an huge jump in Qualcomm stock before hours. This is why.\n\nToo late to bet?\n\nhttps://mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKCN1S82G1", "created_utc": 1556864664, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bk58q1/qualcomm_2_vs_ftc_0/", "is_self": true}
