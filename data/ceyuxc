The impression I'm getting from the call is the concern of a slowing economy and the threat of big competition such as Apple and Goldman Sachs are jumping into the consumer business banking model and industry. All of which is making investors somewhat skittish about the bull case for Capital One.", "created_utc": 1563486880, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ceyuxc/cof_earnings_thread/", "is_self": true}
