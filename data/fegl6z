{"id": "fegl6z", "title": "TDA PDT discussion", "selftext": " So I apparently triggered a PDT call when I rolled some options yesterday. Called just before open today and the guy said no worries, just don\u2019t make another day trade and you\u2019ll be good(I did 4 oops). \n\n   Now this is where it got interesting, apparently if you do go over the 4 limit they will unlock your account if you call up, up to 3 times in one year. So it seems every quarter you can get a \u201cfree pass\u201d for PDT penalty. I thought that was interesting so I figured I would tell all you degenerates as well. Happy trading!\n\nTLDR: if with TDA you get locked out as PDT just called up to 3 times in a year and they\u2019ll unlock you", "created_utc": 1583514718, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fegl6z/tda_pdt_discussion/", "is_self": true}
