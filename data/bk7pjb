Wouldn't the purchase of the out-of-the-money put trigger the wash-sale rule, as I purchased a security on the same underlying after closing a position within 30 days? What about the selling leg of the out-of-the-money?\n\nFinally, if I end up profiting from this spread, both puts would expire worthless. For the put that I paid a premium on, would it still be allowed to be a capital loss subtracted from my gain?", "created_utc": 1556885234, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bk7pjb/how_do_options_spreads_work_with_the_wash_sale/", "is_self": true}
