Strong demand in both EU and America splitting the 9 new realms. Several realms were marked \"Full\" (scale of low, medium, high, full) but people kept registering anyway. Blizzard is saying the several \"Full\" servers may be so overwhelmed the queue system will fill with \"several hours\" wait and people unable to join the queue. So they added more servers and are advising players to move.\n\nhttps://classic.wowhead.com/news=294636/gehennas-now-full-wow-classic-realm-population-updates-for-august-22nd\n\nSupposedly even the \"low\" realms have populations that would be fully populated realms with queues in 2006. Any realm at \"medium\" or above can expect queue times to play.\n\nHopefully ATVI publishes some numbers on \"new\" accounts. Most of the traffic will be existing customers but I can absolutely see people playing classic, getting to max level and deciding to try retail after realizing how grindy it is. Then they'll be in the hook to pay for the expansion packs on top of the $15/mo.\n\nSitting on 9/27 $50c myself which is 1mo past the Aug 27 global release. As a reminder for you younguns this version of WoW was so addictive it caused women to prostitute themselves for in game currency.
