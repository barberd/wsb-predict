{"id": "fvhja0", "title": "Weekly Theta Gang Thread", "selftext": "What an insane week! Total profit was around $16.5k with a huge part of that due to wheeling into USO. I said this before and I\u2019ll say it again, anyone shorting oil in the low $20s is absolutely brain dead. Even without the tweet oil would\u2019ve shot up to $30 soon. It doesn\u2019t matter how low supply is, when enough rigs shut down price will have to go up. Also, every piece of news was about countries begging Saudi to cut production and even logistically the Saudis need to cut due to their break even being the $70s. This is why they wanted Russia to agree to their plan to cut more during the last OPEC+ meeting. I\u2019m not sure where all these people got the info that the Saudis break even is in the teens but it is fake news and they are hurting as much if not more than everyone else. Finally, I know this sub doesn\u2019t believe in crayons but WTI hit $20 **FOUR** separate times and each time it bounced off with significant volume. \n\nThat being said I\u2019m writing more puts on USO this week when it inevitably dips. Probably try to write options on SPY and AMD since there are no fun earnings this week. Let me know what options you are writing. \n\nProof from the last week: https://i.imgur.com/5f09pNz.png \n\nThe first two option plays expired worthless. Not pictured was the WFC puts which was another $300 in profit. This screenshot is right before I sold the USO shares and bought back the calls early Friday so I missed out on the big EOD run. Total profit off of USO with all the puts, calls, and shares was 21k over the past 3 weeks.\n\n\nTLDR: Big money wants WTI above $20, I cashed in on this fact.\n\nEDIT: 60% of my profit from this year has been from writing options, this one play I decided to keep the shares to wheel USO due to the reasons above. I still wrote puts to get assigned the shares.", "created_utc": 1586107689.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fvhja0/weekly_theta_gang_thread/", "is_self": true}
