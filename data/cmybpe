Gay-Fil-A Edition.", "selftext": "*Forewarning:* I have $ADHD so this didn't end up too in depth. \n\nWith the recent claims that Gay-Fil-A is attempting to take Wendy's market share, I thought I should come set the Wendy's Bear Gang straight.\n\nFirst of all, Wendy's is bringing back the Spicy Nuggets. Yup. That's right. August 19th. Get out that ranchie ranchie and buy some calls. I'd put Wendy's target price at $23.44 for August 19th. \n\nLet's look at point number two. I've heard rumors that $WEN is looking at getting some $BYND burgers. Those rumors are retarded. Motherfucking Dave would turn in his grave if he heard this. Those fucking dog food burgers are frozen. Wendy's meat (she has a dick) is never fucking frozen. \n\nOn the other hand, Gay-Fil-A has been pairing up with $AAPL with it's Zesty $AAPL Cider Vinaigrette dressing. It's shit. Don't try it. \n\nIn summary, Bull Gang $WEN. Bear Gang $AAPL.\n\nWin with $WEN.", "created_utc": 1565136013, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cmybpe/serious_an_indepth_dd_of_wen_gayfila_edition/", "is_self": true}
