More and more people will be needing to sell their shit as they run out of unemployment claims this July and eBay is the bro-man. They recently raised their Q2 expectations which saw a nice increase but it\u2019s calmed down since. Once Q2 earnings come, we\u2019re golden. Hell I even sold something on eBay a month ago to sell a junk ps4 for a ridiculously high price and I haven\u2019t used that website in 2 years\n\nThere\u2019s some minor scandal with cyberstalking in the news this week but this happen years ago and the people were already laid off and an investigation launched. It should\u2019ve been priced in. But this has given us a little mini dip to get in. \n\nIt\u2019s in the name!! Buy it!!", "created_utc": 1592580184.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hc2m06/easy_bull_play_ebay/", "is_self": true}
