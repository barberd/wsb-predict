Huge OI on the july 10 strike with good liquidity. This is basically a swing play. They mine silver and gold as well so I think the summer time bullishness with silver will make sure that sbsw will rise to the upside. \nTLDR: sbsw 10 dollar strike for july is very cheap. Typically with a spike in sbsw they double. Alternatively, sell puts as sbsw will probably hold 7.30", "created_utc": 1590768990.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gsvwxh/sbsw_is_due_for_a_comeback_pure_swing_play/", "is_self": true}
