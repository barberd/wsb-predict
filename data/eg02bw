SPR has consistently been bouncing up and down like a ADHD kid who\u2019s forgotten to take his concerta on the intradays which makes it a prime candidate for swinging options.\n\nI\u2019ve consistently swung this shit for a week every time it dips, I sell 1/17 67.5 Ps, re buy them the next day with around a 20% ROI then using what was made to enter more 70s on the Tips rinse and repeat. \n\nIf you look at SPRs charts from the daily to the year, you\u2019ll see it\u2019s not looking too hot for SPR.\n\nTake my guidance with a grain of salt, I\u2019m here to make you autists money.
