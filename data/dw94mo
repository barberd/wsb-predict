Apple stock is getting squeezed, and it'll keep going up for a while. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's about 4.4 billion AAPL shares outstanding\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\* Apple buying back around 80-100m shares / quarter\n\n\\* Central Banks keep bagholding AAPL shares (Norges Bank, Swiss National Bank, Bank of Canada and most likely a bunch of others that aren't public)\n\n\\* Papa Buffet keeps bagholding AAPL shares\n\n\\* Index-based ETFs and funds keep loading up on AAPL shares\n\n\\* Other bagholders that baghold\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLeaves about 129.5m NON-BAGHELD (ie not with HODLrs) shares outstanding currently, down from 205m around March.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMSFT free-float market cap: $1.1T, AAPL free-float market cap $1.17T\n\nMSFT S&amp;P500 weight: 4.37%, AAPL S&amp;P500 weight 4.33%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe two weights need to be inversed so AAPL buying and MSFT selling will continue. The feedback loop will keep making AAPL's weight go up. Other mega caps will be flat or down (AMZN, MSFT, FB, GOOG), except for BRK which will keep inching up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWay OTM calls, June 2020 expiration so it catches 2 quarterly reports (end of Jan and end of March).", "created_utc": 1573735952, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dw94mo/long_aapl_for_the_incoming_supply_squeeze/", "is_self": true}
