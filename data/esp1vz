There are retards out there who think the Warriors still have a chance to win another championship LOL. Sports betting makes crazy money those idiots because they don't have r/wallstreetbets giving priceless financial advice.\n\nDraftKings is the ultimate money machine that will take everyone's free donations into their bank account. Instead of YOLOing your money into some fake ass space clout tourism, make REAL money when DraftKings will have a makeshift IPO by merging with DEAC. \n\n(Source:  [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200106005487/en/](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200106005487/en/))\n\nThis shit is just getting started and the merger is expected in the first half of 2020. GUARANTEED money when this shit goes live. Stocks are for the rich and the poor. However, every daily middle-class fuck named Bob goes balls deep on some $SUPERBOWL calls. DraftKings is gonna be the first legal sports casino that will be on the stock market. \n\nGet in this shit before your dumbass $SPCE calls shit the bed when you realize daddy Musk controls all of space.
