Bold headline to grab your attention**\n\nSome generic garbage about well known investment theories over multiple decades.  How are they relevant to a 2 week hail mary prediction?  They're not, but it gives the illusion I know what I'm talking about.\n\nHere is a [bearish article](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/stock-market-hasnt-seen-absolute-bottom-yet-says-mark-mobius-2020-04-14?mod=mw_quote_news) that I'm sure no one will take the time to read, but due to confirmation bias, put holders will automatically agree with.\n\n**II. Technical analysis**\n\nGeneric fortune telling garbage such as \"support\" and \"resistance\" that makes believing in astrology look reasonable by comparison.  (Number above where we are) is resistance.  (Number below where we are) is support.  Doesn't matter if we collapse through support like it's nothing or break through resistance like it's nothing, there is nothing that will prove the generic statements about support and resistance wrong.  \n\nAlso I drew some fancy lines that shows this is indeed a bull trap.\n\n**III. Some other useless garbage about other markets***\n\nMention commodities, including precious metals, perhaps treasuries to make oneself seem knowledgeable.  More thoughts on what COULD happen versus what will really happen.\n\n**TLDR: this is a hail mary prediction that will gain me a cult following if I'm right and I'll just try again on a new account if I'm wrong. God I love reddit and this sub.**\n\nEdit:  The rally from below 2200 to present levels was perfectly predictable, if you looked at fundamentals and technicals.  No fucking way I'll say anything of the sort **BEFORE** the fact but I'm pretending to be a timeless sage in hindsight.\n\nThese are interesting levels that I'm keeping an eye on: 2500, 2700, 2950.  What does it mean and what tradeable insight are to be gained from these numbers? lol fuck if I know.  Also there is a possibility of a rally to 2880 but I'm looking for an initial fall to 2760 this week perhaps maybe.", "created_utc": 1586875517.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g16sv6/the_great_collapse_why_sp_500_will_drop_below/", "is_self": true}
