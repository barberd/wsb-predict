OR you might hit a point where you wanna take your profits and run before shit hits the fan. \n\nAs a side note: also don\u2019t be afraid to abandon a position at any time if it\u2019s advantageous to do so. \n\nJust today i bought a short-term call option for CCL and closed out of it within an hour. I didn\u2019t plan to do that, but i watched the charts and it looked like a good time to scoop up small gains and get out. If I had no more day trades, i would have been stuck holding and may have lost money. \n\nDon\u2019t put yourself in a position where you\u2019re locked in.\n\nEdit: fixed to \u201cshort-term call option\u201d", "created_utc": 1586912270.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1hw1y/psa_dont_make_plays_if_youre_out_of_day_trades/", "is_self": true}
