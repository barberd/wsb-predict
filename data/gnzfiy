Deleted last time due to hate messages.", "selftext": "\"I was looking into earning statements for SHOP and noticed something weird. Below is the Q-o-Q revenue percentage increase for the previous 4 quarters: 320.48 mil 361.97 390.55 505.2 +49.52% +47.77% +44.62% +46.91% So during the covid-19, their quarterly revenue for the latest quarter gained at the same rate as during \"normal\" quarters. The rate of gain is strangely consistent too. Anyhow, SHOP is majorly held by institutions. So don't buy puts. Prices can't go down if no one is selling. This might be a good short-term calls play if they're cooking the book. Pretty sure the next earning will be +~50% in revenue too.\"\n\nI posted this 2 days ago but deleted it because of the hate messages. I turned out to be right so far (short term).", "created_utc": 1590076579.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gnzfiy/again_something_is_odd_about_shop_or_shopify/", "is_self": true}
