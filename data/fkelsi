{"id": "fkelsi", "title": "[DD] Go long on $CHGG", "selftext": "I'll keep it nice and short for you autists. I'm a university student, and as you know, a ton of colleges have moved to online coursework for the rest of the semester. This means no TA's, no office hours, no going up to your professor after class to ask for help. Sure emails exist, but when the professor is busy responding to the other 120 people in the class, where are you going to turn to? Chegg, thats where. Lots of big brainers are also stuck at home, and will be bored but ready to answer college problems to keep them sharp. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey have earnings on the 27th of April, but the only calls available around that time are April 17th and June 17th.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; $CHGG $35 6/17 CALLS\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would post positions but market is closed. Will update in the morning after the market opens and I enter the play.", "created_utc": 1584484613.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkelsi/dd_go_long_on_chgg/", "is_self": true}
