I'm loading up on 4/17s and 5/15s this week.\n\n5/15 12.5p 4/17 12.5p 3/20 15p\n\nBREW is the Craft Brew Alliance Inc. A bunch of hipsters on the west coast making garbage water. Okay, they're gonna be hit like everyone else, but what makes this interesting to a retard autist?\n\nNothing fuck you\n\nOkay what's interesting is where the breweries are, and that they're nearing an acquisition by Anheuser-Busch. The breweries are Redhook (Seattle), Wildmer Bros (Portland), Kona (Hawaii), Omission (Portland), Square Mile (Portland), Appalachian Mountain (North Carolina), Cisco (Nantucket), and Wynwood (Miami).\n\nNobody is flying out to Hawaii and it's already expensive enough to live there, tourists make up a shitload of Kona's in-state revenue.\n\nPortland has restaurants starting to do delivery-only. Good luck getting a case of your hipster shit dropped off at the front door.\n\nSeattle and the whole area is just getting worse.\n\nFlorida is a shitshow.\n\nConcerts and sports events are getting cancelled. Vegas is dying. People aren't stockpiling gluten free pale ales. Production will slow. Inventory could tank if this goes on long enough.\n\nBut then again don't listen to me because I'm a retard.", "created_utc": 1584317690.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjbje1/brew_is_hipster_shit_destined_to_tank_to_tendie/", "is_self": true}
