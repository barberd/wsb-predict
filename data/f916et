Looks like he made good money. If it really is 50 cents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe paid 4.9 million ($4,900,000) for vix calls for March 24 calls paid for $0.49. Those are now worth $1.50 (or close to it). Since it's worth $1.50 today I think from my math the person made $10,099,880 in profit + their original investment of $4,900,000 totaling = $14,999,880 (I think.)\n\nHere is the CBOE video - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-27hb9C6Ke0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-27hb9C6Ke0)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know 50 cent seems to miss some and loose but I have seen where they are right and work out too.
