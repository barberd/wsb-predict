{"id": "ce3h44", "title": "WFC DD is it going to pop??", "selftext": "So I went in and today bought like 19 call contracts at different price points and expirations. The stock took a dumb after earning. When you look at the earnings etc you see its really doing quite well. I think its going to bounce back. It posted greater earnings, income and revenues. Plus they have been cutting costs. Now they did say they expected the rate cut to hurt them lower rates are bad for banks. But then they also went ahead and got a dividend bump too. I think tomorrow or by Friday my contracts are going to turn into some nice paydays. Or I will go ahead and blow away a few tendies on Wells. Thoughts ? Did you think the drop today was on point or what. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nnews links \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wells-fargo-wfc-q2-earnings-190807061.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wells-fargo-wfc-q2-earnings-190807061.html)\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/wells-fargos-dividend-hike-to-boost-yield-to-more-than-double-peers-sp-500-2019-07-16](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/wells-fargos-dividend-hike-to-boost-yield-to-more-than-double-peers-sp-500-2019-07-16)", "created_utc": 1563313135, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ce3h44/wfc_dd_is_it_going_to_pop/", "is_self": true}
