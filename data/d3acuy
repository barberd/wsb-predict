The fines have grown for their malfeasance, but it isn\u2019t slowing them down.\n\nIs this usual? \n\nI have also noticed that another company, Boeing, despite not having a viable civilian product in aviation and being propped up by defense contracts and the 737 Max not being able to fly (or sell) has to be validated by multiple aviation administrations (EU doing its own evaluation). For all intents and purposes Boeing has a massive overhead cost right now: the 737 max *is the best selling aircraft in history that can\u2019t fly* and many airlines are hurt from planes that have been delivered but can\u2019t even use. Even a large order cancellation (48 planes cancelled by Garuda Indonesia, an almost $5.7 billion sale) didn\u2019t hurt their stock very much. Same thing for flyadeal\u2019s $5.9 billion order cancellation had almost no real impact on the stock.\n\nGM currently is in the throes of a [3.4 million](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gm-brake-recall-gm-recalls-3-4-million-pickups-suvs-over-braking-problem/) vehicle recall due to *braking issues*, and their stock hasn\u2019t seem affected by the recalls or even the tariffs. The recalls are primarily on their truck lines - their vehicles with their biggest profit margins, which will have shrunk considerably with how much it will cost to fix them and even hurt future sales with loss of consumer confidence.\n\nBy all logic the fines due to mistakes should be seriously hurting their stock as profitably takes a dive and they eat into cash to deal with the problems, but many of these companies seem \u201cimmune\u201d.", "created_utc": 1568305522, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d3acuy/do_finesrecalls_affect_stock_price/", "is_self": true}
