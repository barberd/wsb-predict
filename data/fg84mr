This virus is going to bend us over so hard, we'll feel it long after the boomer population gets decimated by it. I want to hear opposing sides of my autistic bets. I want to understand how I'm not a stupid dumb fuck.\n\nLook at Italy. Wuhan. Japan. Iran. All these places are royally fucked for the short to near term.  There's no difference between us and them (except Iran for all I know). They took \"archaic\" measures and quartentined the fuck out of everyone. As you all know, Italy essentially declared martial law tonight and locked everyone in their own homes. From various reports, their hospitals are over run. They're by no means an impoverished country and they're still royally fucked.\n\nHOW IS THE UNITED STATES NOT HEADING TOWARDS THE SAME FATE?!?\n\nWhat the fuck is the Trump Administration doing so exceptionally well that we're not all destined to end up in a lock-down to save the boomers??\n\nHow do not end up with a massive population that is hospitalized? How do we not end up with a shit ton of people not going broke, declaring bankruptcy, defaulting on their shitty sub prime auto loans and taking out this fragile economy?!?!\n\nAlso, fuck off with \"but the flu kills more people every year\" bullshit. If that's your argument, you're not coming to the table ready.\n\nSomeone please convince me to sell my SPY Puts for June ($160 strike).", "created_utc": 1583813728.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fg84mr/how_are_we_not_going_to_get_the_ever_living_life/", "is_self": true}
