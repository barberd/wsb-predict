I'm personally in 3000 shares at 15.72 on the crazy dip.  I have firepower capital to purchase another 5000 shares on dips.\n\nLets face it, road construction isn't going under anytime soon.  As the economy develops, so will infrastructure.  $ROAD is pretty much a monopoly in the states it operates it.  It has significant deferred revenue (since government contracts take a shit long time to pay out) which means future capital will come in fast and huge.  It sits on a potential goldmine of landmark revenue due to continued investments into the domestic economy by Trump.  It has nearly 0 debt, cash on hand, and actually turns a profit.  It is quickly expanding in the USA with recent acquisitions of \nasphault firms further cementing (that's a PUN) its foothold into the road construction monopoly in the states.\n\nToday's trading range was from 15.53 to 18.74 which is a HUGE range.  I got in on the lower end of the range (and it still looks to be on the lower end of the range).  I see this trading back to around its upper range 18.74 in 1-2 weeks easily.  It's currently trading hugely down today due to overreaction (and profit taking) from its missed earnings (which wasn't as bad as it looks if you read into the financials).\n\nIf you followed my previous DD suggestion on $SCVL, you'd have made over 10% and banked huge gains on that (I'm still holding that FYI).  So listen to me again you autists, stop playing with turd shit like $PTON, $ROKU, $TSLA.\n\n***UPDATE 1 (12/10):*** The bounce from its lows of 15.53 to its current price of 16.43 (as of this update) is a testament.
