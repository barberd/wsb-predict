We are confident in this short, but you\u2019re a big boy... do your own due diligence. Manage your risk and hopefully we all get rich if we're right.  And let me specify by what I mean by \u201cwe / us.\u201d \u201cWe / us\u201d = a discord server that has been monitoring this play since someone else and their trade group found some unusual put activity. We are not associated with this trade group in any way, shape, or form and we have not been able to get in contact with them regarding $HTHT. See the original post here, it has a lot of good information: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g09e17/htht\\_the\\_next\\_lk/?sort=new](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g09e17/htht_the_next_lk/?sort=new).  In the sake of transparency, feel free to PM if you want to discuss this with us further.\n\nAlright fuck nuggets, here\u2019s the DD. After reading the original DD post, I started monitoring the options volume on $HTHT intently. It was definitely unusual, considering the put to call ratio on this stock was 34:1 and most of the puts were for 25p 5/15 despite this stock rising. I was really skeptical and thought it could be a pump and dump, but I\u2019ve been searching for Chinese frauds to piggy back off of and profit from (think $LK) so I kept checking up on this.\n\nWeeks pass, and I don\u2019t see this play being shilled anywhere online (mainly checked Reddit, 4Chan, Twitter, Stockwits, and general Google searches). At most there are some comments here and there from AI Twitter bots picking up weird put option flow. The thing that made me go all-in, however, was a bulk purchase of about 17,000 put options ($25p 5/15) right at the end of the market day, April 22. This was larger than the other bulk purchases by a large margin. It was about $360,000 worth of puts for a stock that sees historically low options volume and whose stock price was still rising. I did some digging and found out that they were applying for a waiver for some of their debt covenants. Someone on the original DD post even mentioned it and noted that they\u2019d be likely to receive it. Well, come April 23rd they announced that they received that waiver. Here\u2019s a simple timeline: the waiver was granted on April 17th, the final and largest bulk purchase of put options came in on April 22nd, and the news was announced April 23rd. So, this sounds good right? They got the waiver, so end of story, right? Well, maybe not.\n\nWhoever bought all those put options is still holding onto them. There wasn\u2019t enough volume on Friday to see any meaningful change in OI if this person was selling. Most of the volume on Friday was possibly more people flooding in due to noticing a \\~5% decline in their stock price and the news about the waiver. This waiver isn\u2019t great news for them due to the requirements that they have to meet:\n\n1.) Minimum EBITDA of 1 Billion RMB = 142 Million USD.\n\n2.) No cash dividend for the duration of the waiver.\n\n3.) Net asset value needs to be more than zero.\n\nAdmittedly, $HTHT may not be a Chinese fraud, but my group and I have discovered that it\u2019s an extremely flawed business on the brink of collapse. Qi Ji, the owner of $HTHT, built an empire the size of Hilton in 10 years. It took Hilton 100 years to get to this size. How did he do it? He said by taking the tech sector model of venture capital debt expansion and applying it to the hotel business. Well, that\u2019s not good when you need to meet those three requirements and your liabilities outweigh your assets. According to $HTHT\u2019s SEC filings, they had an EBITDA of 4 billion RMB, and they announced on the 23rd upon revealing of their wavier that their business is faltering in Q1 and Q2 (duh, it\u2019s COVID-19 jackass). But by how much? About a 50% decline. The waiver is only extended until June 2021, but they may run out of steam much quicker. In Q1, they had to close 73% of their hotels under government mandate, they\u2019ve laid off a lot of their staff or put them on furlough, and they\u2019re searching for credit lines. Currently, they have liabilities of 2,571 billion RMB and only 919 million RMB in assets.\n\nIn short, $HTHT is fucked and an insider knew about it. We think that there was a small self-off this Friday, but that more is to come out concerning the financial strength of the company. The largest shareholders are Qi Ji (the owner who has a shady past), his domestic business partners, his holding company (Winner Crown Holdings), and a few of his other companies Qi Ji owns ([Ctrip.com](http://ctrip.com/)). There are two major western investors, Accor (a French hotel group) and Invesco (didn\u2019t do too much digging on this one, just know it\u2019s American). There are almost no retail investors. So, if Qi Ji needs funds, he\u2019ll most likely turn to selling his equity, right? He can\u2019t exactly go out and get more debt-based funding while he has to meet the above requirements. If he starts selling his stock in $HTHT it will tank (Qi Ji - Winner Holdings, Ctrip.com, himself, and his directors - hold approx. 58.2% of this company's stock. As an individual he owns 37%). Well, Accor and Invesco won\u2019t want to be bag holders, right? If this dude sells at a steep discount, it will devalue the shares held by those institutions. Soon, we may be seeing all the big players flee for the doors.\n\nFeel free to correct our logic on this if we are wrong, but we are confident in our play and think this is what is currently going on.  I\u2019m mainly posting this to help gather more information on $HTHT and notify you autistic fucks to what we are seeing.\n\nTL;DR $HTHT $25p 5/15\n\nSEC Filings: [https://sec.report/Ticker/HTHT](https://sec.report/Ticker/HTHT)\n\nOptions Volume: [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/HTHT/options](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/HTHT/options)\n\nWaiver: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/huazhu-group-limited-announces-leverage-020010690.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/huazhu-group-limited-announces-leverage-020010690.html)", "created_utc": 1587839847.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7yq8r/calling_all_autistic_investors_htht_puts/", "is_self": true}
