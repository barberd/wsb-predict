{"id": "h0ob7c", "title": "ORCL before earnings", "selftext": "Wanted to see how the sub felt about playing Oracle now/tomorrow for a run up on earnings. IV is still pretty reasonable around ~49% for 06/19 55 calls. This recent dip might be a good time to get in before next week. Earnings will be on 06/16 After hours.\n\nI currently do not have a position but the 06/19 56c is at .97 currently and will most likely be a bit lower tomorrow based on the after hours price.\n\nBuy the dip and sell before earnings, or yolo through? or be a gay bear? \ud83d\udc3b", "created_utc": 1591835597.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h0ob7c/orcl_before_earnings/", "is_self": true}
