If you can't be bothered to read for 5 minutes before putting money on something, you don't belong here.   You're not an autist; you're just a full blown retard.\n\nWhat you should do first is go read the post where I called the price of the stock pre-earnings and as a great [COVID Recovery Play: PRPL to $12-$14 by 5/12 and $20-$24 by end of Q1 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g30vst/covid_recovery_play_prpl_to_1214_by_512_and_2024/)**.**\n\nAfter that, you need to go read how I predicted the beat on earnings consensus over the weekend here:   [Purple (PRPL) Earnings is Monday After Hours: Here's What to Expect](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ggp2vx/purple_prpl_earnings_is_monday_after_hours_heres/)**.**\n\nOnly after reading and understanding those two things will you be capable of making tendies as described below because you will actually know what you are doing.\n\nIf I've already exceeded your maximum word count, go back to reading the memes on the sub so you can cool your overheated brain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote:  all quotes below are paraphrased from the earnings call.  I am not transcribing that thing.\n\n# 2020 Q1 Earnings Release\n\nEarnings could not have gone better.  PRPL is literally a brand new business that should catch your eye for investment.  I am solidly in the $19+ camp [from my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ggp2vx/purple_prpl_earnings_is_monday_after_hours_heres/) based upon results and the guidance given.   You can still make tendies on this play because PRPL builds its price action over time, which I will cover below.   Let's look at some numbers first.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n||Consensus|Actuals|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Revenue|$106.97M|$122.4M|\n|EPS|$0.05|$0.11|\n\nA solid beat on Revenue, EPS, EBITDA and Adj. EBITDA.   Just an amazing quarter, but the historical isn't the best part.   The forward looking is ***amazing***.  Before we get into that, a few more numbers that matter.\n\n**Receivables**\n\nPRPL has a large wholesale business which means it has significant exposure to bad debts due to retail brick and mortar locations closing and retailers who are obviously cash starved.   Joe told us on the call  that their wholesale accounts are \"largely current on their receivables\" and Purple is \"continuing to get paid almost entirely across the board\".\n\nAwesome.  This means very little bad debt and the revenue earned will convert to cash.\n\n**Warrant Liability Accrual**\n\nYeah, I called this one.   It was material to the shift in EPS, but you are an idiot if you care.   This stuff is equity and should be treated as equity.   Yes, GAAP requires otherwise, but the FASB doesn't always make the best decisions.\n\n**Supply Chain**\n\n>Our supply chain has not as yet been significantly affected by COVID-19. Currently, our domestic suppliers are able to continue operations and provide necessary materials when needed. Suppliers in China were temporarily closed as a result of the pandemic but we had sufficient inventory on hand. Many of our suppliers resumed production in March and are able to supply materials as needed. As a result, we don\u2019t expect supply to have a material impact on our ability to meet anticipated demand.\n\nThere you have it.  Pretty much no supply chain risk.\n\n# Forward Looking Guidance\n\nPRPL did not provide formal guidance for the rest of the year, but the rest of the year is what they mostly talked about on the call, and the management team clearly wanted you to understand April with their \"[Second Quarter Preview](https://investors.purple.com/press-releases/news-details/2020/Purple-Innovation-Reports-Record-First-Quarter-2020-Results/default.aspx)\".  Let's look at what they said.\n\n**Cash**\n\nThey ended Q1 with $26.4M in cash (down from Q4's $33.5M in cash); however, **they ended April with $62.5M in cash**!  Management really wanted to call it out so they put the April cash number at the top with all of the Q1 numbers on the earnings release, which I thought was funny.  In reality, they've done a fantastic job at managing expenses and converting inventory on hand into cash during the quarter.   This should give you quite a bit of confidence in the management team.  This is probably more cash on hand than they have ever had, which means they are well weathered to not just manage this storm (which is a storm that is cash flow positive for them), but to invest ahead of the competition for the future.\n\n**Hiring and Capacity**\n\nJoe confirmed that \"the furlough is all but over\" and Purple is \"actually in hiring mode right now to bring people in fairly aggressively\" in order to expand capacity.   According to Joe, \"***demand has not waned at all***\".  Purple is still selling very near capacity (they brought a new machine online and are expanding their hiring aggressively to fill the capacity).\n\nPRPL announced previously, as a result of COVID, that they were deferring all capital expenditures.They've now done a 180 on that statement.  PRPL is accelerating the completion of the Max 7 machine in order to increase capacity another 20% over last year, which should be done this quarter.  The Max 8 & 9 machines are still happening, but because they are being built in their new east coast manufacturing facility, it is unknown whether they will get them done this year.\n\nIf you have been paying attention to my previous posts, you will remember that ***the Max 8 & 9 machines were not necessary to meet the pre-COVID guidance*** provided for the year.  This is part of why ***PRPL is going to beat their original pre-COVID guidance this year***.  Read on.\n\n**Wholesale Sales**\n\nWholesale is down dramatically.  Duh.  85% of wholesale doors were closed during April, but they have seen through April that sequential wholesale orders have been increasing.   **Believe it or not, we are happy for wholesale to stay closed longer for PRPL.**   What!?!   Yep.  We'll get into that more in a second, but let's talk about the hedge to revenue that wholesale provides.\n\nI strongly inferred in a previously post that PRPL can simply expand wholesale doors to make up for lost same store sells.   Joe just came out and said it on the call:  if wholesale sales are slow to recover on a same store basis, the could just expand to more doors.\n\nAdditionally, their wholesale partners burned through their safety stock of Purple mattresses.  As wholesale doors are opening up, large orders are coming in to restock their inventory.  The trend for wholesale remains to be seen as doors reopen and Memorial Day weekend comes in.  Wholesale doors are achieving up to 85% of demand at most right now and this is a good thing.\n\nThis means our worst case scenario is that PRPL will meet their pre-COVID guidance for the year by simply expanding wholesale doors.  The hedge.\n\n**Direct to Consumer Sales**\n\nTHIS is why PRPL is going to BEAT their pre-COVID guidance for the year.  I'm calling it now.\n\nApril DTC sales were up 170% YoY for the full month.   170%!!!  Not only that, Joe explained that:\n\n>It has been remarkebly consistent.   Briefly saw DTC retract at the end of March.  PRPL saw pretty consistent DTC performance at the beginning of April, but a retraction in wholesale as stores shut down.  ***About the time the stimulus checks hit, we saw a pretty significant increase in our DTC business***\\*\\*.\\*\\*   We did some surveying and we don't think its entirely related to the stimulus checks themselves, but really some sentiment and people settle into the new normal. Since that time, ***we've seen a consistent but eleveated performance on DTC***.  It has really be pretty remarkable on how consistent it has been.\n\nThis means the run rate exiting April was greater than 170% YoY for DTC (if the average of 170% includes half the month at a lower rate).   Joe told us that this is more than offsetting the decline in wholesale.\n\nPRPL will beat pre-COVID guidance for the quarter and for the year because:\n\n* They have a new Mattress Max machine as of the beginning of the quarter (20% increase over last year's unit manufacturing capacity)\n* They are still selling everything they can make.\n* They receive greater revenue and margin from every DTC unit relative to wholesale.\n\nTherefore, we will see a revenue and earnings beat for the next quarter and likely the rest of the year.\n\nPRPL management believes that unit demand never disappeared and that they've seen a shift of demand from their brick and mortar partners to online (which means PRPL makes more money per mattress).\n\nAdditionally, they've seen a decline in marketing acquisition costs as many competitors are struggling and overall advertising costs are dropping nationwide.  The acquistion model online is much more simple than attempting to spend to get people to go into stores (for anyone who understands modern digital marketing, these means they will be able to scale their spend and revenue justifiably easier and faster).  New customers as a % of all customers (in terms of traffic and purchases) has gone up as they have been able to cast a wider net digitally and had a higher conversion rate.\n\nJoe's words about the boost in revenue caused by the shift to DTC are:  \"it is distorting revenue up\".   Joe, this is going to distort the stock price up too.\n\nLastly, Joe stated very clearly their plans for wholesale reopening offsetting DTC revenue in their manufacturing constrained world:  \"they would throttle their wholesale growth until they could continue to expand their capacity\".  DTC for the win!\n\n**A slow return to normal will benefit Purple by boosting per unit revenue and margin.**\n\nLike I said, this is a brand new business.\n\n# Forward Looking Price Action - More Tendies!\n\nThere are still opportunities to make tendies with PRPL tomorrow and over the next quarter.  Here is why.\n\n**PRPL Builds Price Momentum**\n\nBecause PRPL is a mid-market stock with not a lot of following and mid-market volume, its price actions are not immediate.  The typical pattern after earnings is that the price adjustment builds slowly over the next day to whatever direction earnings dictates.   Then, the price action continues to build over the next quarter.  Look at the price action after the Q3 2019 earnings call if you want the most pronounced example of this.\n\nWherever we start tomorrow, I'll bet money that we end much higher.\n\n**PRPLW Lag**\n\nPRPLW warrants do not behave like your typical CBOE options where market makers have algorithms changing the bid/ask on every strike with every movement of the stock.   Typical market makers accept those prices at every level because they are delta hedging with your play.\n\nPRPLW warrants are OTC and there is no options chain currently, which means not a whole lot of market making.   While this makes them less liquid, it also means that PRPLW warrants typically lag the price of PRPL stock on the way up as you are trading against other people.   Plenty of scalping opportunities on big price movement days if you know what you are doing.   If you don't know, it means you can usually get a good deal if you buy into a longer-term hold.\n\n**Short Interest**\n\nSHORT INTEREST INCREASED!!!  The 4/30 numbers are out tonight and short interest increased a whopping 33.5%!   That means we have a short float of 10.72%.\n\nIf you recall my weekend post,  only 16.44% of float is left with non-institutionals.   Those 2,439,121 short shares are going to get squeezed.   The shorts got hurt today with ER and they are going to want to slowly exit their position over the next day or so, which is another reason why we may see momentum in the stock tomorrow.   If there is a push behind it, we may see a much more dramatic squeeze.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yqo6ilxgv8y41.png?width=791&format=png&auto=webp&s=6bcdb6ded74c2d3281d7a98717e11aad72e17975\n\nWe still saw a significant amount of short volume through today.  As the stock gaps up, margin calls are going to happen.   As shorts cover and new buyers buy in, this will accelerate.   Depending on your broker, margin calls could have days to cover, which means we will see upward pressure over a few days.\n\n**Press Coverage**\n\nPRPL is still not a well known stock.  It will likely get some better press coverage over the next few days for two reasons:\n\n1. It slaughtered earnings better than most companies this season.\n2. Casper, a media darling, reports tomorrow morning.\n\nIt is Casper's first earnings release since IPOing.   Whether or not it is a disaster, most reporters will start drawing comparisons to PRPL.   More visibility through the day tomorrow and weeks to come will drive further new investment as people start to understand what is happening here.\n\n**Index Additions**\n\nPRPL gapping up and growing will only increase the number of indexes it gets added to and therefore funds that are required to buy in.   More cash investment required over the next few months will only support a growing stock price.\n\n**Great Fundamentals**\n\nLastly, this stock had great fundamentals before this huge earnings beat, and fundamentals always win in the long run.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck tomorrow and let's get some tendies!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Positions\n\nI have one share of PRPL.   I made $2 on it today and am up $1.91 since open.   In great wsb tradition, I'll probably do a gain post on that.\n\nThe PRPLW warrant prices don't update AH.   That's where I ended the day.   I had a steak dinner tonight to celebrate.   The wife tried to give me a chicken salad from Panera, but I wasn't having it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p8xftnpzz8y41.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=005bd6c3156a79eeab3d4ec007858cb6efb94c73", "created_utc": 1589251556.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gi2hed/prpl_killed_earnings_tendies_can_still_be_made/", "is_self": true}
