Companies worry that earnings will miss? They slowly and quietly lower estimates. \n\nThe entire game is rigged for stock prices to go up and all the systemic problems that led to 08 did was ensure the government put in a safety net. The Fed has even openly said they would be open to the idea of outright buying securities, if needed, to ensure they had another tool in their tool box. \n\nSo, stop looking at the markets through the eyes of a market participant and start looking at them through the eyes of a politician or government figure. Then, ask yourself: which of them is going to actually let themselves get labeled as the one who killed the bull market. In this era of unprecedented government manipulation of the stock markets any bet that markets will crash has better odds if you just went to Vegas.", "created_utc": 1580655354, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/expie0/heres_why_the_markets_wont_crash_in_2020/", "is_self": true}
