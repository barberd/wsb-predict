{"id": "fuhj5z", "title": "A lot of you\u2019re selling puts but you should really be buying more", "selftext": "A lot of you bought puts when SPY was near the bottom of the downtrend which was $218. Volatility was at it\u2019s highest so they were expensive...and now you\u2019re getting screwed so you\u2019re like fuck this and selling for a loss because you\u2019re getting IV crushed. \n\nBasically, you\u2019re the same as the bullish investor who bought shares of SPY when it was at a support level of $263 during the downtrend. Then it dropped to $218 and now he\u2019s like fuck this I can\u2019t take this pain anymore so he sells. Then the next week SPY goes back to $263 and he realizes that was a dumb move. \n\nYou want to buy puts when a stock is at a resistance level (such as $263 for SPY) and when volatility is low. If you bought closer to $233 or $218 then you bought near the support level which is the opposite of what you want to do. Puts are cheaper when SPY is on the uptrend at a resistance level like $263 with volatility also being lower...so your cost to profit ratio will be much greater because when VIX goes back up the puts get more expensive which is good for you. \n\nAlso, a lot of you are buying puts that expire in a week or two. This is a bad idea. If I\u2019m holding puts that are 3 months out then my plan is to SELL them 30 days before they expire. Why? Because theta is a bitch during the last 30 days, the daily loss amplifies greatly. \n\nIn the last month there has never been a better time to load up on puts. VIX while still elevated is dangling right at it\u2019s support level and will likely not go any lower. SPY has already retraced to $263 which was the top. Now we\u2019re on our next leg down which I believe we will go below $181 and closer to $167 with VIX going over $100, all by the end of April. \n\nThis sideways chop has been killing everyone but this is not the time to sell. You need to be loading up more because when VIX goes above $70 again and you\u2019re like \u201coh shit it\u2019s going down let me buy puts\u201d you will buy them for a much more expensive price. \n\nI bought puts at the end of January on the opinion that the virus was going to crash the marker and I suffered in the red for almost 3 weeks before the market started to go down. It was a painful 3 weeks but the wait was worth it. VIX was like $15-$20 then when I bought.\n\nPoint is you make the most money by being in a position to profit BEFORE the stock moves greatly. Not during it or near the end of it.\n\nWhile TA is highly frowned upon here (mostly because none of you know even wtf you\u2019re looking at) it is very helpful in giving you key areas to look for (support and resistance) to know when to buy and sell. If you aren\u2019t using TA then you\u2019re essentially trading in the blind. \n\nHere\u2019s a chart I made for [SPY](https://ibb.co/vh0L2q2)\n\nThe blue lines are both support and resistance lines. When a stock drops below it\u2019s support line that same line then becomes the resistance and vice versa. Reviewing the chart you can see that it\u2019s a good tool to have to be able to predict when a stock may bounce or retrace while reviewing other indicators such as RSI and moving averages to back up your claim.\n\nRemember to ignore your emotions and trust in your DD. \n\nSPY SPX TSLA June 19th 2020 Puts", "created_utc": 1585951408.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fuhj5z/a_lot_of_youre_selling_puts_but_you_should_really/", "is_self": true}
