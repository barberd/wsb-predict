Then the shale revolution happened and the stuff went from value added to single-handedly keeping Al Gore from becoming homeless. Because production product from frack wells is light sweet crude, the product mix they produce is relatively high in nat gas and nat gas liquids when compared to more traditional E&P projects. The results of US oil production going hyperbolic is the generation of nat gas byproducts at such a rate that oil producers sometimes resort to flaring the excess due to a lack of alternatives.\n\nThis nat gas oversupply as a result of high oil demand has meant that, for the last 4 years, nat gas has hovered around breakeven prices for most producers. This has resulted in Henry Hub spot nat gas prices printing the lowest tick reading since electronic records have been kept of such things. Energy speculators have piled into nat gas futures short as a means to harvest premium from the relatively steep contango that the NG contract exhibits. While CL futures contracts have a reputation for being some of the most net long futures traded, NG futures have the inverse reputation. In recent history, NG contracts have been perpetually significantly net short. The few times in the last decade where this became untrue saw Biblical levels of short squeeze.\n\nThere are multiple inputs that can begin the cascade of short covering in nat gas, but the important variable in this instance is the historic bull route in CL futures that occurred in April. Nat gas lags crude moves but eventually nat gas will move inversely in a similar manner to the way crude moved: catastrophically.\n\nThe most obvious take is to hodl UNG shares to glory, but for those of us that understand futures and aren\u2019t into findom or being a money manager\u2019s pay pig, the contango rate in NG futures makes this solution undesirable. The alternative is to take up a position in a producer that is well positioned to capitalize on the inversion in the energy market that will occur once the nat gas market positioning rolls over (which is already starting)\n\n [https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/cftc-natural-gas-speculative-positions-1820](https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/cftc-natural-gas-speculative-positions-1820)\n\nMoves in stocks are leading indicators as they are populated entirely by speculators and not by participants looking to hedge risk as in the commodities market. Participants in the energy market have already begun to shift their holdings, selling off highly leveraged, crude-dependent producers (OXY \\*cough\\*cough\\*) and rotating into \u201cdry well\u201d producers which produce a much higher fraction of nat gas and nat gas liquids. The poster children for these types of wells are E&P companies in the West Virginia Marcellus shale fields \n\n [https://geology.com/articles/marcellus-shale.shtml](https://geology.com/articles/marcellus-shale.shtml)\n\n). Companies that produce in this region include COG, SWN, CHK, RRC, EQT, and a smattering of other E&P names. CHK\u2026. well what can I say about CHK that hasn\u2019t already been said. EQT and COG are decent companies but have less correlation to nat gas prices and therefore are suboptimal for playing the nat gas shorts\u2019 position implosion. SWN and RRC are the two most sensitive companies to nat gas prices. Because RRC is more leveraged than SWN, the fulcrum on which the share price balances upon is much more sensitive to the performance of nat gas futures.\n\n [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/range-announces-first-quarter-2020-213010611.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/range-announces-first-quarter-2020-213010611.html) \n\nThis can be witnessed in the 5 year range of the stock. Though RRC is arguably less profitable than its counterparts, it exhibits a fairly secure debt structure and maintains avenues to secure additional working capital if the need for short term liquidity arises (looking at you CHK). Technical analysis of both the RRC and NG continuous contract charts also point to a sympathy breakout developing in the next several weeks in both assets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oodijithd2x41.png?width=2156&format=png&auto=webp&s=fee82f2e0a9ad8027468f10f9d39d10ba083c6ec\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sy672ithd2x41.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=efdedeb43ec130ad8e32abef8decb9fa2b11af12\n\nRRC has recently broken above it\u2019s intermediate-term range and is now holding at the bottom of a low volume range that RRC swiftly traded through on the way down.\n\n [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RRC?ltr=1](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RRC?ltr=1)\n\n Resistance from where the tick is currently to higher prices is relatively miniscule. Charting suggests that it is attempting to move back to test its previous high volume range from $9-12.\n\nThis represents a 50-100% upside in the stock that will print rapidly once the stock begins moving. The impending volatility in the stock will be the product of two things: the unwinding of the short side of the NG futures market and the pairs trade that it will provide, and the astronomically high short float/ratio that the stock currently has the pleasure of experiencing\n\n[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RRC](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RRC)\n\n With few technical sell signals above us, when this event kicks off, pairs traders and shorts will likely rush into the bid side of the market, only to find that the order book has become too thin to accommodate them.\n\nTl;dr Crude is in the trash, Nat Gas is the Karate Kid, the gayest bears of them all are about to be yeeted to the upper stratosphere (Musk\u2019s BFR not required), and the chart for RRC doesn\u2019t lie. Disclosure: I may or may not have a bunch of RRC Jun19 6/8 calls spreads (because that was the only liquid one when I bought them when the underlying was \\~5.20). These are my two cents.
