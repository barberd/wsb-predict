(Prices below reference the US pricing of the ADR). 13% div yield, p/e below 10, has gone from $70-$16 in the last 5 or so years.\n\nPros: that dividend yield, nice p/e, possible gains?\n\nCons: levered as fuuuuuck. Dividend may not be sustainable at current commodity (oil) prices, dividend ratio is too high for their level of leverage. $70-$16 in 5 years. Wtf?\n\nIf oil goes up, she could be a winner, but if oil goes down we\u2019re looking at some dividend cutting and some sad numbers in my brokerage account.\n\nI\u2019m keen to throw money at it, but also keen to not light my tendies on fire.", "created_utc": 1578095921, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ejo5v2/vet_vermilion_energy/", "is_self": true}
