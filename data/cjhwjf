What the fuck spooked the market? Is this just the de-pricing in of additional cuts? It\u2019s like everyone got to their desk, market opened, And they were just like \u201cnah fuck that\u201d. \n\nParticularly if fed comes down hard on this just being an insurance cut instead of the start of a cycle, news comes back bad from China, and job numbers are strong we go down. Far down imo. \n\nMix all that with.. mediocre earnings this could be an equation for hurt if you\u2019re long. \n\nNeutral scenario is fed only cuts .25, but stays neutral on future cuts, AAPL doesn\u2019t tank, no news from China, and average job numbers. \n\nJesus take the wheel.", "created_utc": 1564436467, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cjhwjf/more_rekt_incoming/", "is_self": true}
