As philanthropic and humanitarian as Bezos is ([fuck you Whole Foods](https://www.businessinsider.com/whole-foods-ceo-employees-donate-vacation-coronavirus-report-2020-3)) , Amazon is hiring a shit-ton of new works, mostly those that have either lost their jobs or have been furloughed. I've thought this for a while, but the whole dependency thing on food/supplies/necessities magically showing up on your door step is handy-dandy till... it doesn't.\n\nIt's no news that Amazon literally treats their employees like slaves, offers sub-par working conditions, no bathroom breaks, and an environment where if you [croak while on the job](https://nypost.com/2019/10/19/amazon-workers-forced-to-go-back-to-work-after-fellow-employee-dies-on-shift/), no one gives two fucks and they'll replace you faster than [Prime-Now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGEAiUeiaKs). \n\nWell, after some DD (texting a few friends), I've come to the conclusion that Amazon packing any able bodies in their warehouses with [little to no proactive testing measures](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/amazon/amazon-workers-say-theyre-not-checked-for-coronavirus-symptoms-despite-cdc-recommendations/) and are [not even complying with the 6-ft, social distancing rule.](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-warehouse-modifications-during-coronavirus-2020-3) that their warehouses are soon going to be a breeding zone for the Coronavirus.  A friend also tells me they're allowing up to 60+ hours a week working! With an economy like this, who wouldn't?\n\n**Amazon warehouses are going to be like Jerusalem in World War Z.** Where are all their fulfillment centers? Right outside large cities like... oh.. I don't know.. [Manhattan, Akron, Jacksonville, North Las Vegas, Dallas.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Amazon_locations) Many of these are part of states that are already on lock-down. What's not mandatory in a lock-down? Going to work. What do you get for working in a breeding house of the most influential novel virus for centuries? Spread that to everyone you come home with. These lock down cities are going to have a false sense of security until these workers, most likely asymptomatic, gives their parents, spouses, children, etc a direct taste of this. **As much as our economy depends on Amazon bringing us essentials cause we're literally** [too fucking fat](https://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/articles/2018/07/06/12/42/cover-story-obesity-and-cardiovascular-disease-risk) **to run to the grocery store, this is going to cause chaos.** Grocery stores will be over run. Toilet paper will be our next commodity.   People will resort to eating Ol' Roys. People are going to panic, and mass hysteria will ensue. \n\nAMZN $1500P May 15 or puts on anything in the next 3-6 months.", "created_utc": 1584742496.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fm3wia/how_many_of_you_lazy_autists_get_your_groceries/", "is_self": true}
