{"id": "g27goe", "title": "My long and eloquent prediction by the time November rolls around.", "selftext": "Honestly, I think by the time the debates between Trump and Biden roll around we will have already had our first real taste of an absolute economic meltdown, or at the very least, be recovering from the first, shit has officially hit the fan market \u201cbottom\u201d per se. In which case Trump will still brag about how much worse shit we could\u2018ve been in had it not been for him.\n\nAt the very very very best, we will be on life support at that juncture, like we are now, EXCEPT most people will all be in agreement about it, save a few diehard retard boomers like that bitch who got fired from fox for saying Wuhan virus is a fake plot to overthrow Trump. In any case, come November,  we all will all know how much worse it will get before it gets better. Trump will probably pivot to something like: \u201cImagine if demented Joe were at the helm. Then we\u2019d really be fucked!\u201d\n\nAnd he might be right. But the more I think about it, when I see all you ABSOLUTE FUCKING RETARDS yoloing your life savings away on a whim, like a fucking millennial licking an ICU toilet seat in NYC, and still making it out on top, I could actually see how in some ridiculous parallel universe, Joe Biden could be the unlikely retard who somehow weathers us through the upcoming shitstorm, and into greener pastures.\n\nBut even though any halfway competent incumbent like a Governor Cuomo, would have a halfway decent chance of beating Trump, and even though Biden will be handed this presidency on a silver platter, Trump will still be re-elected, for better or worse.\n\nPosition: $75 IWM November Puts. Tesla, Amazon, and big tech will carry SPY through, BARELY, ...but not the small mid caps. And to answer your question, yes I am high, but not as high as your wife\u2018s boyfriend\u2019s bank account.", "created_utc": 1587008765.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g27goe/my_long_and_eloquent_prediction_by_the_time/", "is_self": true}
