Based on several factors, I\u2019m not currently allowed to \u201cearn\u201d money right now. So I can\u2019t yolo. But I have an income and I need to put some of it in a place with high liquidity come January 2, when, as things are now, I\u2019ll have no income and need cash.\n\nSo I\u2019m looking for a reasonably safe strategy with reasonably high upside.\n\nI\u2019m thinking TSLA box spread but I don\u2019t think I have the cash to do that on my Robinhood so I\u2019m guessing just slightly OTM calls. I honestly don\u2019t care if I lose a little money. That\u2019d be better than the hookers and booze it would have gone to.\n\nThanks ahead of time, fellow autists.\n\n!Remind150Days", "created_utc": 1563966195, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ch6qec/im_coming_to_you_guys_for_some_advice/", "is_self": true}
