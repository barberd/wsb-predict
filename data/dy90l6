Our objective was to describe trends and variations in Impella\u00ae use, clinical outcomes and costs across US hospitals in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) patients treated with MCS (Impella\u00ae or intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP)).\nMethods: From the Premier Healthcare Database, we analyzed 48,306 patients undergoing PCI with MCS at 432 hospitals between 1/2004-12/2016. Association analyses were performed at three levels: time-period, hospitals and patients. Hierarchical models with propensity adjustment were used for association analyses. We examined trends and variations in the proportion of Impella\u00ae use, and associated clinical outcomes (in-hospital mortality, bleeding requiring transfusion, acute kidney injury (AKI), stroke, length of stay (LOS) and hospital costs).\nResults: Among PCI patients treated with MCS, 4,782 (9.9%) received Impella\u00ae; its use increased over time, reaching 31.9% of MCS in 2016. There was wide variation in Impella\u00ae use across hospitals (&gt; 5-fold variation). Specifically, among Impella\u00ae patients, there was wide variation in outcomes of bleeding (&gt; 2.5-fold variation), and death, AKI and stroke (all ~1.5-fold variation). Adverse outcomes and costs were higher in the Impella\u00ae-era (years 2008-2016) vs. the pre-Impella\u00ae era (years 2004-2007). Hospitals with higher Impella\u00ae use had higher rates of adverse outcomes and costs. After adjustment for the propensity score, and accounting for clustering of patients by hospitals, Impella\u00ae use was associated with death: OR 1.24 (95%CI 1.13\u20131.36); bleeding: OR 1.10 (95%CI 1.00\u20131.21); and stroke: OR 1.34 (95%CI 1.18\u20131.53), although a similar, non-significant result was observed for AKI: OR 1.08 (95%CI 1.00\u20131.17). Conclusions: Impella\u00ae use is rapidly increasing among PCI patients treated with MCS, with marked variability in its use and associated outcomes. Although unmeasured confounding cannot be ruled out, when analyzed by time-periods, or at the hospital-level or the patient-level, Impella\u00ae use was associated with higher rates of adverse events and costs. More data are needed to define the appropriate role of MCS in patients undergoing PCI.\nKey Words: Impella\u00ae; Intra-aortic balloon pump; mechanical circulatory support; percutaneous coronary intervention; angioplasty procedure; cardiogenic shock.", "created_utc": 1574109237, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dy90l6/publication_for_20_abmd/", "is_self": true}
