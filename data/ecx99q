{"id": "ecx99q", "title": "TRUMP IMPEACHED [DD INSIDE]", "selftext": "Just kidding, this is about SQ vs MSFT.\n\nLet me preface this by saying I know this isn't /r/investing so it'd be retarded to ask for trading advice on here that isn't related to YOLO'ing something. That being said, you fags are my people and we're codependent as hell so why would I cheat on you now.\n\nAnyways, on to the actual setup....\n\nI own equity in SQ, thanks to that SQ/MU meme train (650 shares in play. Avg cost basis was $28 bucks). The high was $100 just over a year ago, but it dipped significantly and has been trading sideways in the $60s for months now. There\u2019s a ton of untapped/potential upside, but lots of inherent risk as well. The tricky part is, I\u2019m trading some of it on margin (I\u2019ll circle back to why that\u2019s important later).\n\nNow, I also own equity in MSFT (only 75 shares atm @ cost basis of $105) and one LEAP (call) contract ($115 strike, Jan 2020 expiry). My question to you is, what should I do with the call? \n\nI have three available options. \n\nOption 1 \u2013 \n\nI sell the call. The premium on the option was $11.50 (and since a call is the right to buy 100 shares at the prescribed strike price, the real $ cost was $11.50 x 100 so $1,150) when I bought it, and is now over $40 (so real equity $ = $4k). I\u2019m up 250% atm, and because I bought the LEAP over a year ago I\u2019d only pay long term cap gains tax on that. \n\nTl;dr this is the get rich quick + take the money and run option.\n\nOption 2 \u2013 \n\nI roll out the option (new strike &amp; expiry). Basically means I would sell the LEAP I currently own and use some of my gains to purchase another ITM (in the money) or slightly OTM LEAP, let\u2019s say Jan 2021 w/ $150 strike price. This is the worst option IMO, since I lose out on the right to own 100 MSFT shares @ $115, and don\u2019t see as much lift as if I were to sell the call outright. That being said, my portfolio (including the 650 SQ shares mentioned above) would remain intact and otherwise unchanged.\n\nOption 3 \u2013 \n\nI exercise the call, converting my contract into 100 shares at $115 per share (cost basis = $11.5k). I eat the premium (so lose out on the aforementioned immediate gains) but am also not taxed because there are no actualized gains. Here\u2019s the kicker though \u2013 I am stupidly not cash heavy like I used to be, so my risk appetite has shrunk considerably. At the moment, SQ is the only stock I own (that I\u2019m willing to sell) that would be long term cap gains taxed. So my thinking is this \u2013 I would sell \\~175 shares @ current value (so like $66ish pps), which would net me $11.5k pre-tax upfront and allow me to fund exercising the MSFT call. HOWEVER, I don\u2019t know how that would play out in real terms because of the margin I took out initially to own SQ. Worried some of that leverage might disappear as soon as I sell SQ because Robinhood has fucked me in the past in a similar vein with AMD. The closest analogy to this phenomenon would be entropy. Once it\u2019s gone, you never get it back. I need to continue operating within the Robinhood framework (in this case, at least), so this is sadly an actual consideration.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t sell MSFT anytime soon if I were to exercise (I\u2019d probably sit on them for a year+), so it basically boils down to whether the 175 shares of SQ will net me a greater profit than 100 shares of MSFT in the span of a year. \n\nTl;dr this is the long/value play, since MSFT is a rocket ship with no direction to go but up. I lose out on the gains on the contract premium, as well as all future gains of 175 shares of riskier SQ stock (possibly more, if my margin limits reset), to own 100 $115 shares of MSFT (trading at $155 currently). So as long as Microsoft\u2019s share price doesn\u2019t dip below like $124 (my true breakeven book value), I\u2019m cheddar.\n\n**So the super mega tl;dr is, what do you think would see the greatest ROE in 1 yr? 5 yrs?** \n\n**175 shares of SQ (currently trading at $65)**\n\n**vs** \n\n**100 shares of MSFT @ $115 (currently trading at $155) MINUS the initial $1.2k premium I paid for the contract**", "created_utc": 1576780311, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ecx99q/trump_impeached_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
