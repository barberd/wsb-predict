{"id": "e9bbij", "title": "Saudi Aramco", "selftext": "Okay guys let's get serious for a moment. The big oiler in the Middle East was just listed today on the market. They got an evaluation of 1.88 trillion dollars and the stock traded 10% higher above IPO price. Fellow autist, we need to jump on the bandwagon as early as possible. They are literally the BIGGEST company in the world. Even if they start to fail, The little arabs will be able to throw millions upon millions of shekels into the company due to their insane oil money. This could be it for us. This would be the lucky brake for all of us who lost our money on silly puts. This it the time for some HEAVY calls. This will be the moment we will be explaining to our grandkids, the moment we became millionaires.\n\nTLDR; Saudi aramco good, buy a shitload of calls.", "created_utc": 1576090565, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e9bbij/saudi_aramco/", "is_self": true}
