{"id": "g21v0g", "title": "Unusual/Aggressive Options Data: TAL NFLX NCLH WORK UAL", "selftext": "Here is the options data for today, these orders i found the most aggressive and unusual with repeating orders for several tickers expiring next month. Not all expires next month but watch the ones that do as they have time. Watch the OI tomorrow and see if these contracts go into OI or not.\n\nHere - [https://ibb.co/x8RFhkV](https://ibb.co/x8RFhkV)\n\nAlso   all these orders volume of the contracts exceeded the open  interest    in  multiple trades so it's most likely not closing  positions. Either    buy  to open orders or sell to open orders and  based on the       aggressiveness  of the orders one can infer its buy  to open.  Some of   these may be  hedges and some most likely not.\n\nDon't  just  enter YOLO's in  positions based on this data alone in most  cases.   Use    technicals/fundamentals/options data/market feelings all  combined     instead of just 1 of these.   Use protection like spreads if  you worry     about losing what u put in and be  smart, understand the  risks of   putting $ into weekly expiry's, consider a longer expiry.  Learn IV AND  IV CRUSH!!\n\nAlso with the market going lower use technicals/fundamentals/options  data-flow all combined.\n\nWanted to add, I make these posts a lot with different tickers, when I am most confident I make a whole thread for one ticker. Like I    did  in  the past with MSFT/AAPL/TSLA/DIS, I am saying this because I    have   different levels of confidence the orders will work out. These    orders   today are aggressive but not super super aggressive. So the    confidence   level is lower than something extremely aggressive and    unusual like SBUX order flow I posted about in the past.\n\nWe are in uncertain times so these orders have less of an impact.   Technicals say there is more room to fall in the indexes so most     companies should follow.", "created_utc": 1586988313.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g21v0g/unusualaggressive_options_data_tal_nflx_nclh_work/", "is_self": true}
