Cliff notes to follow. \n\nGatherings of 250 people or more are banned. So much for the mariners opening. \n\nSeattle area schools closed for 2 weeks minimum. \n\nPretty sure UW has canceled classes, I saw quite a few students loading up cars and toting suitcases this week. Definitely less students on campus. (I work at a jobsite on campus) \n\nGov Inslee also remarked that his actions would also reflect policies being laid out by trump tonight. \n\nNo doubt things are about to go tits up here. Loading up on canned goods, ammo, and puts tomorrow.", "created_utc": 1583967883.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fh69cv/wa_state_virus_update/", "is_self": true}
