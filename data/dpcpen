[LYFT **0.98%** ](https://quotes.wsj.com/LYFT?mod=chiclets)raised its outlook for the year and\u00a0built on recent Wall Street momentum with results that showed a 63% increase in revenue and more earnings per rider using its ride-hailing app.\n\nThe results prompted Lyft to improve its full-year guidance for the second quarter in a row. The company said it expects annual revenue to of $3.57 billion to $3.58 billion, up from $3.47 billion and $3.50 billion. It trimmed its estimate for adjusted annual losses to $708 million to $718 million, compared with previous guidance of $850 million to $875 million. \n\nLyft said Wednesday revenue climbed 63% in the three months ended Sept. 30 to $955.6 million. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had projected revenue of $915 million for the quarter. \n\n\u201cJust across the board, the third quarter exceeded our expectations,\u201d Brian Roberts, Lyft\u2019s chief financial officer, said in an interview. \n\nThe results mark the San Francisco-based company\u2019s third earnings report to Wall Street since going public, and provide one of the strongest indications that Lyft could achieve profitability and become a self-sustaining company despite investor skepticism over its losses and regulatory challenges. \n\nInvestors have already pushed the company\u2019s stock up about 9% in the past week, after Lyft\u2019s founders said last week at a Wall Street Journal conference that the company [would be profitable](https://www.wsj.com/articles/lyft-expects-to-be-profitable-a-year-earlier-than-projected-11571765364?mod=article_inline&amp;mod=article_inline) on an adjusted earnings basis, before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, by the end of 2021. That is a year ahead of analysts\u2019 expectations. \n\nThe company\u2019s net loss widened to $463.5 million in the period, compared with a loss of $249.2 million in the year-earlier quarter. Lyft attributed the bigger loss to $246.1 million in stock-based compensation and related taxes, tied to the company\u2019s March initial public offering.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, the loss narrowed to $128 million from $245.3 million, compared with a consensus analyst estimate for an adjusted loss of $206 million. \n\nAnalysts with Wedbush Securities wrote in a note Friday that they were expecting strong results and viewed the quarter as \u201canother step forward towards regaining investor credibility for Lyft.\u201d Wedbush expects Lyft stock to surpass its IPO price of $72 in the next 12 months. But the company has a long way to go to achieve that milestone: on Wednesday, Lyft shares were trading at about $44.\n\nKey to Lyft\u2019s future profitability is eliminating discounts and subsidies and making more money per ride. Lyft said it had more than 22 million active riders in the third quarter, a 28% increase over the same quarter a year ago. It earned an average of $42.82 per active rider, up 27% from the $33.63 it brought in per rider last year. \n\nMr. Roberts attributed the increase in part to Lyft attracting more passengers willing to pay a higher price\u2014mostly business travelers who can expense their trips to their company. Also, neither Lyft nor rival [Uber Technologies](https://quotes.wsj.com/UBER) Inc. are offering as many promotions and subsidies as they were a year ago.\n\n\u201cThe market is increasingly rational. There is significantly less discounting from a year ago, and we expect these market conditions to continue,\u201d Mr. Roberts said.\n\nThe company still faces some challenges, including a regulatory crackdown by states and courts. One of the biggest threats to Lyft is California\u2019s [passage of Assembly Bill 5](https://www.wsj.com/articles/california-enacts-law-to-classify-some-gig-workers-as-employees-11568831719?mod=article_inline), or AB5, intended to make companies classify workers such as ride-hailing drivers as employees eligible for legal protections. \n\nLyft has said it has about 325,000 drivers in California. On Tuesday, Lyft joined Uber and delivery startup DoorDash to unveil a ballot initiative intended as an alternative to reclassifying workers and which would include a guaranteed wage of at least 120% of the state\u2019s minimum wage. Advocacy groups representing drivers have panned the initiative as an effort to maximize profits while preventing drivers from unionizing. \n\nA decline in the number of new users and active drivers could derail Lyft\u2019s profitability timeline, according to analysts. Eric Ross of investment research firm Cascend Securities said Lyft\u2019s new app downloads have weakened since last year.\n\n\u201cOur measure of app downloads show consistent declines since very strong \\[second half 2018\\] growth,\u201d Mr. Ross wrote in a note.\n\nSimilarWeb reported a slump in the number of daily active Lyft drivers, which may suggest longer wait times for passengers if fewer drivers are cruising the streets for rides, according to the market intelligence company. SimilarWeb studied the number of daily active users for Lyft\u2019s driver app for Android phones.\n\nLyft\u2019s founders have said they are looking to subscription services to provide a meaningful portion of the company\u2019s future revenue and growth. This week, the company introduced a subscription service for about $20 a month, aimed at encouraging customers to take more rides by offering various perks and discounts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/lyft-raises-guidance-reports-increased-revenue-11572466096](https://www.wsj.com/articles/lyft-raises-guidance-reports-increased-revenue-11572466096)", "created_utc": 1572468916, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpcpen/lyft_raises_guidance_reports_63_increase_in/", "is_self": true}
