Was making small gains until I decided I wanted to live the GUH life, so I decided to experiment with the retarded stonk app. I deposited $2k (which the limit) from a debit card account with no cash but RH still gives you access to it right away. So, after that I upgrade to RH gold which has a $5k max instant deposit limit so total I have $5,160...put them in apple and spy calls and currently at $7,155.
