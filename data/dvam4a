Alright so I\u2019ve spoken to 4 Delivery drivers(3 UPS 1 Fedex) they all agree that they have been seeing a massive influx of blue boxes from Walmart. Walmart is eating amazons lunch in my opinion. Amazon even indirectly, in my opinion, highlighted this during their last quarter earnings report. First off Walmart has next day shipping that not only, allegedly, costs them less to ship but is supposedly faster than amazons. It is also free for orders of a certain value. Walmart has been price matching and price beating amazon. I\u2019m a Lego reseller and I can confirm that Walmart and target both have been crushing amazon in pricing. Those few dollars make a difference to business owners. In my opinion Walmart is positioning itself to be amazon but with actual physical stores which would one up them because they would appeal more to the lower income communities who cannot afford to ship their products or who simply are not on a FedEx/ups route. Walmart also has a borderline fascist form of food delivery that will allow Walmart employees to literally enter your home and stock your fridge but nonetheless less, people have been very positive about their grocery delivery, great thing about Walmart is they have a more direct consumer selection for groceries, everything in the store can also be shipped, allowing shoppers to see items first in person before deciding to buy. The strength of Walmart earnings is going to be based on its delivery service. Wall Street wants to see them compete directly with amazon. \n\nPlease gamble responsibly, I\u2019m not responsible for any losses or cocaine and whores you may or may not enjoy.
