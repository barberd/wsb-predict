{"id": "cqtrke", "title": "$CSCO &amp; Trade War", "selftext": "I think its pretty nutty that in less than 72 hours, Cisco lost virtually all their stock gains from the past 6 months. I'm looking at about the beginning of Feb 2019 to now.\n\nApparently CSCO was hit alot harder by the trade war than the market expected. Something about China shunning their business combined with low guidance for 2020. \n\nIs it common for a stock to drop like they did with that kind of news? Or is the market just very skittish right now with all the volitility? How common is it for a stock to lose 6 months of stock gains in 72 hours or less? \n\n***Tldr; Am I a total retard for thinking Cisco would spike up yesterday?***\n\nStorytime for context:\nI have made two options plays since I started trading options. First was AMD last week: http://imgur.com/gallery/M2fzl29\n\n2nd was a CSCO call for 52.80 break even expiring 8/16. This is where I'm at today Down down down https://imgur.com/gallery/E7nNW8e\n\nIn hindsight, buying a call with 3 days till expiration on the worst trading day of the year was a very bad idea. Also, investing $136 dollars on the call, and being 16 shares deep on CSCO avg cost of $51 dollars, my position heading into earnings was way too big. \n\nI would have been much better off had I split up my investment into other plays this week, such as $WMT or $A. More diversification of my earnings play this week would have been less risk to my portfolio. I just got too focused on \"Cisco wont lose\".  \n\nI intend to win my next option play. I've got $515 cash now, but I'm going to wait to see how long it takes for my losing stock positions to break even again, sell, and get back in this game with my full investment power.\n\nPs, for full context, this was where my portfolio was at before this week went to shit on Wednesday morning: Pre Wed news https://imgur.com/gallery/QkgYngs\n\nAutistic $LK share holding docked me -$40, then $CSCO continued to fuck me hard. Luckily $BABA came through for most of us today. Also shoutout to $GO. This discount baby ain't done yet.", "created_utc": 1565893431, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cqtrke/csco_trade_war/", "is_self": true}
