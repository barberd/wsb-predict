{"id": "e270dh", "title": "100 Million in one year or less", "selftext": "Hello fellow autists,\n\nI first started my trading journey around 16 months ago. I took out a loan and had an initial capital of 800 dollars, had absolutely no previous experience and started with Robinhood. Within a month I had around 30k dollars and was pretty damn happy. Afterwards things started going downhill after I tried messing with SNAP options and it definitely took me awhile to get back my edge.\n\nAt this point, I finally feel confident that I've got what it takes. I've learned the basics, developed my instincts, have a game plan when I open a trade, basically, I got my shit together. I've taken a couple months break to also reflect on any mistakes I might have been making.\n\nSo that's why I'm making this little bet with WSB, the bet is I will be able to make 100 Milion dollars in one year (or less) from the date of this post. If I win this bet, the first 50 people who comment on this post will get 500 bucks. If I lose, then I'll do something embarrasing, not sure what yet ( suggestions from  u/stormwillpass  are welcome).   \n\n\nP.S: I know the chances of this happening aren't huge but I (like many of you) believe I am **the one** who will succeed where so many have failed.", "created_utc": 1574812147, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e270dh/100_million_in_one_year_or_less/", "is_self": true}
