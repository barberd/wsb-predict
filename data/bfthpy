I just wanted to know my fellow August\u2019s opinion on trading a stock the day they release warning but not holding it through to the next day. What I\u2019ve realised is that a lot of stock will go higher on the day of earnings mainly because of buzz. I recently tried this with NFLX by holding it 2 days prior earnings. As you may know, it rallied up to the earnings call but was flat the next day due to weak guidance. I\u2019ve also done some backtesting and have seen many big tech names go through this pattern, what do you guys think of this and is it a more viable method than trading the earnings themselves?", "created_utc": 1555879997, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bfthpy/trading_the_run_up_to_earnings/", "is_self": true}
