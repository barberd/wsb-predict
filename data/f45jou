I showed my mom where MU\u2019s price is right now and she knew where it was before. She's at her wits end with me and I told her to just give it 2 more months, but she isnt having it. She took away my XBOX too and I'm in South Dakota where there is nothing else to do but play Halo 3. Shes telling me to go work in an oil field but I dont want to be killed when we are so close to financial success. Any South Dakotans I can stay with for the summer? I'll give you 5% of my profit. Or anyone else know what to do", "created_utc": 1581747288, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f45jou/my_mom_is_kicking_me_out_of_the_house_should_i/", "is_self": true}
