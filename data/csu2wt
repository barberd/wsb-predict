Current standards only see vessels using Low Sulfur Marine Oil when within 200 n. miles of US and EU territories; however, the new convention sets standards on international marine vessels that will essentially prevent the use of Heavy Fuel Oil.  \n\n\nHeavy Fuel Oil (IFO 380) has a bunker price of \\~$300 compared to a LSO (LSMGO) bunker price of about \\~$500 &lt; [https://shipandbunker.com/prices](https://shipandbunker.com/prices) \\&gt;  \nGoldman Sachs forsees 240 billion higher fuel price &lt; [http://www.weltinnenpolitik.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMO-2020-Global-Shipping-Blue-Sky-Moment.pdf](http://www.weltinnenpolitik.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMO-2020-Global-Shipping-Blue-Sky-Moment.pdf) \\&gt; plus scrubber market to see an additional 15 billion.  \n\n\nAccording to McKinsey:  \n\"\" We estimate that the switch to marine gasoil will add about 1.5 million barrels per day to distillate demand globally, leading refiners to run an additional 2.2 million barrels per day of crude oil through distillation. This should increase refining utilization in the major hub markets by 2.9 to 6.7 percentage points. Margins will rise as a result, with European Brent cracking margins expected to be up $3 per barrel. \"\"  \n\n\nExpecting shortages in the LSO market, increase in shipping price, and an increase in margins on extraction and refinement, now would be a good time to break open your \"Logistics and Supply Chain Management\" textbook from 1995 and start making bets accordingly.", "created_utc": 1566285569, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/csu2wt/dd_ocean_carriers_and_low_sulfur_regulation/", "is_self": true}
