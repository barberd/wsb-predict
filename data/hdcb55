We had a cross on MACD Exponential H1, H4, but we\u2019d need continuation downward on Monday to see the cross on the daily chart.\u00a0\n   * This would lead me to believe that we\u2019ll see some continuation Monday morning, but whether or not the bulls step in is still unclear.\n* Volume totally petered out by EOD\n   * Volume weighted MACD Daily looks lower\n   * Volume weighted MACD Hourly looks like we maybe found strong enough support\n      * Will it hold?\n* Monthly - looks a bit like a doji candle which could be a sign of market top\n* Weekly - trending up, but with some selling pressure\n* We do have some sell signals, but we also have a couple of buy signals as well\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Sell**\n\n* Big bearish candle with some potential follow through\u00a0\n* Momentum Crossover\n* MACD Crossover\n* Volume Weighted MACD (Daily) cross\n\n**Buy**\n\n* Daily bounce off the 21 EMA, although not with a lot of volume\n* H1 - Several of my indicators cross the signal line back up, albeit very sheepishly\n   * Lower time frames ultimately, but these need to happen first to change the larger time frames\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThere seems to be some indecision about where we head next. If there is not a little tiny bit of follow to the downside, I\u2019d be surprised. Note, it\u2019s very likely that I\u2019ll be surprised given how unclear this situation is.\u00a0This could also just be a pullback to the 21 MA with another leg higher.\u00a0I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we have at least another inside day before the market decides which way it wants to go.\u00a0I would also think we have some continuation lower to start the day at least.\u00a0", "created_utc": 1592765768.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hdcb55/spy_weekly_prep/", "is_self": true}
