{"id": "fxuqvn", "title": "A story of harrassment", "selftext": "The date is April 9th, 2020 as I walk into my therapists office. \n\nI sign in with the receptionist and sit in the corner far away from anyone else, it is obvious to everyone else that I am retarded.  \n\nSoon enough I am called to the room to talk with my therapists.  He is a good man and I believe that he actually cares about my wellbeing.\n\nWhat has brought me here again for the 3rd time this month you might ask yourself?  You see, just last month I invested in some puts on companies that will surely fail due to being closed and losing large parts of their workforce and revenue because of Covid 19.  DIS puts, SPY puts, PLAY puts that expire May 1st and even some long options on F and HOG.\n\nThe therapists tells me to sit down and asks if the bad man has touch me again.\n\"Yes he has,\" I stutter out fighting back the tears.\n\"Show me on the doll again where J Powell touched you.\"  \nI cant help but cry now, the pain is too much.  I grab the doll and pull out my little pp and force it into the anus of the doll.\nThe memories become all too real now and I begin uncontrollably sob louder while screaming, \"money printer go brrrrrr,\" and \"dont bet against Merica boy!\" All while fucking the doll.\n\nMy therapists has seen this before.  He tells me to calm myself as he will write a prescription for more xanax and lube for the next time Mr. Powell decides to fuck me.\n\nHe tells me i should sell now as nothing has expired worthless yet, but he has forgotten that I am retarded.  I get up and walk out of his office with tears still streaming down my face.  As I shut the door my therapists goes to his closet where my girlfriend has been the whole time. \n\n\"I'm going to fuck you like that retard gets fucked by Powell every day now.\"\n\"Money printer go brrrr,\" she says licking her lips.  \"Give this printer your ink daddy so we can printer more money!\"\n\nI log onto Robin hood to buy more spy puts when I get home.\nEnd", "created_utc": 1586447248.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxuqvn/a_story_of_harrassment/", "is_self": true}
