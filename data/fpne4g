I wrote this in response to why he should buy LEAPS on SPY. Some of you nogs are gonna nog, I get it, but if you aren\u2019t retarded just read this once.\n\nIt is a medium term investment of more than 2 years, with the option to buy at the strike. Right now premiums are very volatile, and being 2 1/2 years away from expiry and a possible near bottom in the foreseeable future. \n\nIll do the math; basic shot at my way of seeing this play. \n\nYou have $10,000 to buy up investments with. Say today you took that $10,000 and bought 90 contracts\nof SPY 12/16/22 Expiry at $500 at 1.12 premium, thats $112 per contract, times 90, thats $10,080 total investment. Volatility is high my friend, and boomers are taking their money out the banks, while younger generations like myself can\u2019t wait for the bottom\u2014it means a new bull rally, which every bull run in history is exponentially bigger than the one before it. This means that the chance of touching $500 is highly likely. The fed did this once in the 80\u2019s, once in 2008/2009, and both led to bull runs. \n\nAnyways...see these explanations.\n\nHere is the percentage profits on that trade with the calendar dates pretty far out (the chart goes further)\n\nProfit Percentages by Strike x Date > https://imgur.com/a/MHp60Qw\n\nHere is what you will have if it gets back to $350 by February 2021 > https://imgur.com/a/If4VBo1\n\nAnd say you got lucky and the market came back very hard - a lot of momentum on the upside, more volatility and it touches a new high of $400 then you my friend would have what is known as a \u201c10-bagger\u201d in one year, scraping clean with $118,080 minus your initial 10,080, and you scrape out clean with $108,000. Set some aside for taxes and go. > https://imgur.com/a/KSs1wdP\n\nI hope you enjoy reading this, because I enjoyed writing it and feeling it out by explaining it to you has caused me to unintentionally perform a bit of DD. The thing about all of these numbers still leave you with a little less than 2 years to expiry. I\u2019m probably going to make this play myself once I\u2019m comfortable we aren\u2019t in an up down market, because we are clearly way down and LEAPS are a sure fire way to make money, plenty of delta built into premiums right now.\n\nEDIT: Those numbers in the green boxes of the pictures represent your gains in percentage for you little kiddy retards, and I don\u2019t think millenials will become scared of the market, we can live check to check, so people will keep investing, and the S&P will surpass 350 easily. I\u2019m of course being optimistic, and you have to be.\n\n\nTL;DR\n\n12/16/22 $500c (LEAPs) 90 contracts will cost\nyou $10k, payout in a year is $40-108k.", "created_utc": 1585269921.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpne4g/if_you_have_patience_and_10k_heres_a_freebie_for/", "is_self": true}
