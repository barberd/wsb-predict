{"id": "helpqr", "title": "Advice for the gay bears (SPY 320)", "selftext": "I hate to help this faction out because most of the time you guys post the equivalent of an emo's myspace page as ''DD'' or ''TA\" and think the economy will crash because you want it to or something but I'm in between brokers and mega bored so might as well help you guys out.   \n\n\nSo basically today we bulled through both of SPY's recent resistance points at 312.2 and 313.7 meaning there's not much in the way of the Bulls until we hit 321.1 if we finish the day above 313.7. So at that point just get out of the way for the next week or so because we're going up babbyyyyy. (Also fucking lol at NKLA put buyers getting destroyed in 3 days, reverse FOMO if I've ever seen it).  \n\n\nBut not all is lost because 10 points ahead is basically a brick wall of resistance. Remember what happened last time we touched 320? Spy got rejected harder than a short bus kid asking a cheerleader out to prom. We probably won't see the same amount of blood we saw on that day but we will be due for a good market correction. We got strong resistance points all the way to 330 and from the institutional pullback we got last time we were there, very little desire from big money to fly that high.  \n\n\nIf we get there again the amount of positive news and FOMO will probably be through the roof and that's your time to strike.  We're already seeing a good influx of autistic bears posting their loss porn on the frontpage which means it's spooling up. When you see 2-3 fuckos put all their $$$ into SPY 330 calls it's going to be the go sign.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust don't buy some $ROPE till then', your day will come.", "created_utc": 1592942107.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/helpqr/advice_for_the_gay_bears_spy_320/", "is_self": true}
