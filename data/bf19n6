The more I think about it, the more I'm confident that SQ will bounce to 72.50ish on monday. 72.50 was support and has turned to resistance. SQ should bounce after five solid red daily candles and retest 72.50ish.  \n\n**The play: 4/26 (FD) 75calls. Ideal price between 0.26-0.32/contract**. Sell when SQ hits 71.90 (see blue line). If daring, sell when SQ hits 72 (see yellow line). If really greedy/daring, hold until wednesday.  [https://www.tradingview.com/x/xA5KZnmW/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/xA5KZnmW/)\n\n(note: i'm not sure if SQ will *reverse* and run up to ER, because it will depend on so many factors. If PYPL beats, SQ will jump for sure, for instance; but if PYPL tanks, SQ will tank as well. I'm gambling on a necessary technical bounce, after 5 days of drilling). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. **MCD**. \n\nMCD just had a MASSIVE pre-ER run up and made a new ATH yesterday. I was holding puts, of course, thinking it needed to cool off before ER and for profit taking. My timing was off by a day (i bought puts on wednesday, lol). I think it's time to load up on puts on Monday. Yesterday, the 190p 4/26 were at 0.22 (a great price). Before it starts pulling back on monday (my prediction) hope to load up on **190p's fd's at 0.22/3ish and sell at 0.35 for 1k profit.** \n\nER is on 4/30. It HAS to pull back before ER.\n\nThe 5/3 option prices are really expensive, obviously, because it's pricing in ER. It's probably less risky to pick up at a few 190put 5/3, currently $1.79 a contract, but you know it's not an FD play, so.... \n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/x/WRI4fJEs/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/WRI4fJEs/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. **QCOM**. Their ER is on 5/1. Investors will take profit after this massive fucking jump it just had. It will very, very, very likely retrace before 5/1. It has a gap to fill to previous ATH, which was around 76.50ish. i don't think it can hold until ER. Easy money play.\n\n**The play:**  buy atm 79puts 5/3 exp, for 2.16ish and sell when you like your profits. Exiting when QCOM hits 76.80ish is conservative and reasonable. \n\n**Another play:** 4/26 (FD), 75p (big open interest), for between 0.3-0.39ish. 0.3 would be an awesome price. buy 100 and sell when QCOM touches 77 on tuesday (my prediction), and sell for 0.55ish? \n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/x/CYIW7EDz/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/CYIW7EDz/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\\*ER plays:** \n\n1. **KO.** Massive fucking dump last ER. It dropped all the way to its 2014 high. Pretty shitty. It's now recovered over 200dma. It seems to me that investors are *looking* to be positive on KO. This is a kind of you can't kill what's already dead play.\n\n**The play:** 5/3exp 49calls for between 0.16-0.20. The ideal (fantasy) case: buy 100 for 0.18 on monday, KO beats and jumps to 49, and sell at 0.50, for on 4/23, for 2k profit or so. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. **T.** Two kinds of plays: \n\nA. buy as many shares as your porfolio can afford and leave yourself $1k in cash to fuck with options and hold the shares forever and rake in 6% dividend tendies until your 65years old. \n\nB. **5/10 33calls for 0.26ish.** This has the largest open interest. Buy 100 of these, for example, and if T beats, sell at 0.40ish, for 1k+ profit.", "created_utc": 1555692075, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bf19n6/my_plays_for_week_of_426/", "is_self": true}
