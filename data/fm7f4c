{"id": "fm7f4c", "title": "NYC Hospitals will soon hit capacity", "selftext": "We are not only hitting the exponential part of the curve for diagnosis boys. More and more patients with hypoxia (low oxygen) are coming in with the same profile - low/normal white cell count, low lymphocyte (that's a special type of white cell that is part of your adaptive immune system) count, high C-reactive protein (marker for inflammation), and lung changes on XRAY or CT scan. Lots of these are healthy young people who shouldn't be needing any oxygen even with the worse influenza. The big NYC hospitals have scrambled to get ICU's converted from regular medical floors and more ventilators. **But we are about to hit the exponential part of the \"critically ill patients\" curve.** \n\n  \nBeds are so tight that we will have to cohort positive patients into the same negative pressure room soon. We are running out of N95s - using the same one for a week straight! You're supposed to use one for each visit for each patient in reality! Even my regular face mask I'm allotted to one every 3 days. What the fuck is going on?!? NYC's health system is going to be on the brink of collapse at this rate by next Friday/weekend - mark my words. I wish it weren't true. This doesn't mean we will stop taking patients. It just means that the expected outcomes for each admitted patient will be inferior to what we should be able to provide as a first world country with supposedly advanced healthcare.\n\nI pulled out of my SPXS position for a modest 10% gain from last night today because I'm still waiting for my left nut to descend. There's no way the market will be able to rebound next week. I wish I had better than my paper hands but all my courage is being consumed taking care of these sickies at the hospital. \n\nPlease consider donating some of your gains to help your fellow healthcare autists stay protected to continue taking care of you guys. Stay safe you SOBs.", "created_utc": 1584756160.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fm7f4c/nyc_hospitals_will_soon_hit_capacity/", "is_self": true}
