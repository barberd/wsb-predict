{"id": "c1uf7o", "title": "CRM Tomorrow At Open", "selftext": "If you follow my posts and suggestions you'll know that I'm right a lot on big bets. Week before last week and last week I was preaching FB calls. If you listened, congrats. \n\nCool thing about the market is that there are opportunities everywhere. This week is big for stocks with fed meeting tues and wed. Personally, I think Powell will continue to be dovish but rates won't be cut. Overall market effect will be rally. If rates cut, effect will be rally. He wouldn't dare be hawkish, so I think we're safe with calls. However, some stocks are safer than others.\n\nCRM is one of the safest because it has yet to recover to even close to its post earnings level, which was a great earnings report. The double whammy of unrelated antitrust news (which arguably affects FB more than anyone and look at them) and the DATA acquisition pushed the stock down. It has been consolidating for a week, being accumulated, and it's nearly ready to take off to near its old levels in the 160s.\n\nA more conservative estimate is mid 150s, which I think could be the extent of its short term recovery, but am leaning more towards high 150s low 160s recovery over the next week. These estimates I believe will come to pass regardless of fed meeting.\n\nSo get your CRM calls soon. I am loading more tomorrow morning just in case, but tomorrow could be another consolidation day with little movement.", "created_utc": 1560812048, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c1uf7o/crm_tomorrow_at_open/", "is_self": true}
