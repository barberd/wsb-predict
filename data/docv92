I have calls I got last week at $155 for April 2020 EXP @ 1.9 and they should be trading much higher. I believe spot should be trading at $220 range and see the stock trading at 175 by mid November. The stock stopped its rise around 11 today and I\u2019m buying more $200 range calls tomorrow at open as I\u2019m expecting the stock to rise at close of day today and fall at open tomorrow before it gets back to $160 range by end beginning of NOV...SPOT is gunna continue to rise as the company has had 30% yoy growth and the only reason for its fall was worries in podcast investments...as the investments in podcasts in the industry show as Spotify steals some of APPL 60+% market share- expect HUGE returns and way better than expected earnings next quarter. \nI would love to see what you guys think", "created_utc": 1572287082, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/docv92/purchased_spot_calls_on_thursday_up_234_today_but/", "is_self": true}
