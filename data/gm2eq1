I learned that with credit spreads you can get assigned after hours and also even if you don't have enough buying power (unlike on RH where they will sell early to protect you, which is why I didn't close out). BA spiked down to $119.9~ AH.  Got assigned 500 shares ($60,000 worth of shares) (my account is a small $4k account). Got margin called for $25k this weekend. Sold them today for $4k profit.\n    \nhttps://imgur.com/a/E1n43ND\n   \nhttps://imgur.com/a/YPfYQ26\n  \nToday in school I learned that it's a good idea to close out and that this seems like a cheat code to get access to $60,000 margin lmao", "created_utc": 1589811941.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gm2eq1/4k_gain_off_a_mistake/", "is_self": true}
