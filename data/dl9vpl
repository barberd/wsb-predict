{"id": "dl9vpl", "title": "giving the heads up for an upcoming rally in China stocks with gold declining", "selftext": "My charts are reflecting a huge shift in asset allocation for Chinese investors selling their physical gold and putting it back into stocks.  Maybe stuff over there got so bad that investor sentiment hit rock bottom at least for the short-term.  I'm buying more FXI.  The big thing here is that Chinese stocks have shown better relative strength than the S&amp;P 500 in recent days enough to flip charts to the bullish side.  Charts have been bearish for Chinese stocks vs the S&amp;P 500 since early May of this year.  Things have changed.  This may be bullshit, but do what you want with your money.  Gold, on the otherhand, is going to hit the skids here.  The best case scenario for gold is to just do nothing, but that's not going to happen with the TLT possibly making a significant top.  If the TLT breaks the September lows, it's going to problematic for gold because gold basically follows treasuries in price.", "created_utc": 1571704797, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dl9vpl/giving_the_heads_up_for_an_upcoming_rally_in/", "is_self": true}
