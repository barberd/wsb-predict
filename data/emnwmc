If I hold it overnight I usually end up getting fucked with a massive move not in my favor.  What the hell.\n\nBBBY fucked me with their shitty earnings report yesterday.  Should have gotten puts because it's a shitty company.  But you know why I got calls?  Because their last earnings report in 2019 I had puts because it's a garbage company and that shit went through the fucking roof.
