{"id": "g9bqqw", "title": "The Cheesy Collapse of Papa John's & Domino's Pizza", "selftext": "In a podcast, former founder of Papa John's, Papa John, breaks down the current economics contributing to delivery pizza's rally in the current COVID environment. Check out the full clip [here](https://youtu.be/s4sPpzSWtEw?t=3932).\n\n**Factors Contributing to the Rally**\n\n1. People are not dining out and are consequently ordering more pizza delivery & takeout.\n2. Oil prices are extremely low = lower gasoline prices = fewer costs to deliver pizza.\n3. Cheese prices are very low. Cheese contributes to 30% of the cost of making a pizza.\n\nTogether, these factors are increasing the demand for delivery & takeout pizza and are also simultaneously reducing the cost of goods for pizza delivery services, making them more profitable. This has resulted in a rally for PZZA and DPZ. But when will it end...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So Why Short Pizza Delivery?**\n\n1. The stay at home orders will soon be loosened, leading to more people dining in. We may have some time still for this to be fully realized, but it could happen in a month's time. Especially in states that haven't been very severely affected by COVID.\n2. The price of cheese is not sustainable at $1/lb for the dairy farmer. They break even at around $1.65 - $1.70 / lb.\n3. Everyone will be driving again and oil demand will stabilize, increasing the price of gasoline and the cost to deliver pizza.\n\n**It's All About the Cheese**\n\nCurrently, cheese is less than $1.10 / lb ([source & chart](https://www.ams.usda.gov/mnreports/dywacheese_cmebl.pdf)). Milk is perishable within 3 days time. So, as the price of cheese falls, the dairy cattle are sent to the slaughter as the current supply for cheese far exceeds demand and more money can be made on selling beef than the cheese the cows produce. Once the demand for cheese stabilizes as people are getting out and about, the price of cheese will skyrocket to $2.50 - $3.00 / lb as the supply of dairy cows cannot be quickly increased to meet the new demand.\n\nFrom the USDA's most recent report on cheese ([here](https://mymarketnews.ams.usda.gov/viewReport/1059)):\n\n>Report 17 - Released on April 24, 2020  \n>  \n>Cheese production varies from plant to plant, region to region. Milk availability does not.      Cheese plant managers are managing output against the widely accessible milk supplies. Some      are cutting back, working on projects and updating. Others are running six and seven day      workweeks. Spot milk prices ranged from $6 to $8 under Class for the second week in a row.      Some cheese producers have reported upticks week over week in food service demand, but when      compared to previous years, the differences are noteworthy. Retail orders are somewhat busy,      as cheese market prices are so low customers are less hesitant to take on a little extra.      Regarding storage, multiple contacts report cold storage is and has been a concern. As      inventories grow, some cheese producers are looking to age/store cheese loads and wait for      greener market pastures. **All said, cheese market tones are bearish. Market contacts hope to      see some corrections posthaste, as some states are looking to, or already have, begun to lift social distancing restrictions.**  \n>  \n>Information for the period April 20 - 24, 2020, issued weekly  \n>  \n>Secondary Sourced Information:  \n>  \n>**The weekly average price for CME barrels is $1.0255, compared to $1.0115 one week ago. CME  blocks\u2019 weekly average is $1.0310, compared to $1.0080 last week.**\n\nAnd from the previous report ([here](https://mymarketnews.ams.usda.gov/filerepo/sites/default/files/1059/2020-04-13/173316/ams_1059_00056.txt)):\n\n>Cheese inventories are growing for the most part. There are some positive reports from cheese producers who are primarily shipping into retail channels, **but many cheese producers are growing concerned about storage space**. Some food service demand is reportedly growing      slightly week to week, although when in comparison to previous years, sales are noticeably      slower. Other contacts have said that even weekly changes are on a downward slant.      Production, in those plants that are running regularly, is active. There are some plants  closed for longer-than-normal holiday breaks, while others are closed to use this time for plant updating/maintenance. Milk is very available and wholly discounted on the spot market.      Reported spot milk prices in the Midwest was $8 to $6 under Class III. **Cheese markets are      some of the hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.**\n\nWe are starting to see an upward trend in the price of cheese ([here](https://mymarketnews.ams.usda.gov/viewReport/1601)). For a 40 lb block, the price increased by $0.12 / lb for a 40 lb block and $0.0425 / lb for a barrel of cheese. We may be heading for a spike in cheese prices soon.\n\n**When Should You Go Short?**\n\nPapa John's uses approximately 2.5 million pounds of cheese a week. Today, that means their cheese expenditures are approximately $2.6 million / week for cheese compared to $5.0 million / week when the cheese hits $2 / lb. **The business model of Papa John's is no longer sustainable once the price of cheese hists approximately $2 / lb**. Consequently, when you see cheese hit $2 / lb it is time to short Papa John's (PZZA) and likely Domino's (DPZ) pizza.\n\nKeep track of the price of cheese [here](http://www.cheesemarketnews.com/markets/dailymarkets.html).\n\n**TL/DR: Puts on PZZA and DPZ when the price of cheese hits $2/lb.**", "created_utc": 1588029265.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9bqqw/the_cheesy_collapse_of_papa_johns_dominos_pizza/", "is_self": true}
