{"id": "f3z001", "title": "Bullish on $SNE", "selftext": "$SNE has seen rapid growth the past few months and with the PS5 on the horizon there's further opportunity for growth. The PS5 has leaks and speculation but nothing concrete, the news that made it drop today is obvious. Anyone with half a brain would know the price of the PS5 would be expensive, the PS4 pro sits at $400 retail atm and they can't drop the price of that more than $100 because of manufacturing, and they would release a PS5 with only a $100 price gap between the two. The fact that it's gonna be expensive is known.\n\nIf they can't keep the price down, they'll sell at a loss on consoles, but with a subscription service, licensing for games and more they'll be fine. \n\nAll that matters is further information dropping, once a press conference occurs they'll skyrocket.\n\nSo, bullish on $SNE, just bought $75 calls expiring 4/3. Buy before the dip is over.", "created_utc": 1581715233, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3z001/bullish_on_sne/", "is_self": true}
