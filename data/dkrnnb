However, a few people I follow seem to be very optimistic about the NWL turnaround story. Do your own DD and trade accordingly.\n\n-----\n\n\"When S&amp;P and Moody\u2019s made their upbeat projections in 2018, they made an error that understated Newell\u2019s indebtedness, according to a Wall Street Journal review of the rating firms\u2019 calculations. They have since fixed their numbers, but still rate Newell investment-grade. Investors have been less forgiving, selling off the bonds and driving up their yield.\n\nThis past February, Newell announced that its debt was 3.5 times earnings at the end of 2018. But Newell failed to account for lost earnings from businesses it sold when it calculated the figure.\n\nInvestors were skeptical, said James Dunn of CreditSights, an independent credit research firm. He estimated Newell\u2019s actual debt load to be 5.3 times projected earnings.\n\nMoody\u2019s and S&amp;P\u2019s leverage estimates mirrored Newell\u2019s approach, according to a Journal review of their calculations. Moody\u2019s estimated Newell\u2019s year-end leverage at 3.8 times in a Nov. 2018 report. S&amp;P put it at 3.9 times in a July 2018 note.\n\nMoody\u2019s also overstated Newell\u2019s earnings by double-counting amortization when calculating earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization\u2014the denominator of the leverage ratio.\n\nAdjusting for the errors, Moody\u2019s estimate of Newell\u2019s leverage should have been closer to six times earnings, the Journal found.\n\nMoody\u2019s confirmed its 2018 calculation included earnings from businesses Newell had sold. Moody\u2019s said the calculation was just a different way of measuring leverage, though it agreed that double-counting amortization was an error, and said it corrected it in October.\"\n\n[WSJ Source Link](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bond-ratings-firms-go-easy-on-some-heavily-indebted-companies-11571563801)\n\n-----\n\n[Full article here - DocDroid](https://docdro.id/N0IZwdL)\n\n[Chart 1 - Non-financial corporate debt since 2009](https://imgur.com/z3TrHmb)\n\n[Chart 2 - Investors losing faith in Newell and Kraft Heinz](https://imgur.com/AMrT3VH)\n\n[Chart 3 - Corporate leverage ratio since 2009](https://imgur.com/mQf2z3B)\n\n[Chart 4 - Moody's estimates of Newell's debt repayment continue to fall short](https://imgur.com/E8cEzep)", "created_utc": 1571613692, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dkrnnb/moodys_sp_overstated_earnings_when_calculating/", "is_self": true}
