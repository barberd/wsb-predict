How the world reacts is all that matters, the market and media don't give a fuck about the truth. \n\nToday my university sent out 2 separate emails to the entire student body. First email they said they have decided to cancel ALL university related spring break trips. ALL of them regardless of location. Second email them came just recently saying they are cancelling our annual on campus dance marathon charity event. This shit never gets cancelled. Regardless of how serious this virus actually is everyone is losing there shit. \n\nTLDR; University is cancelling any and all upcoming travel programs as well as a massive annual event we have on campus. Coronavirus fears are FAR from over \n* we might moon still though bc market doesn't give a fuck", "created_utc": 1583358010.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fdka5a/beer_virus_news_fresh_off_the_press/", "is_self": true}
