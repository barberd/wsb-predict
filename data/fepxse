I'm working on a GitHub now.\n\n[It's here.](https://github.com/joesocktwo/Wall-Street-Bets-Master-Doc) Anyone with experience managing a repository, feel free to reach out. Respond to the discussion opened by ctabka to be invited as a collaborator.\n\nAlright, guys. Whew, holy shit. I did *not* expect my post to blow up like that. I woke up this morning to *hundreds* of messages and thousands of comments. I've been trying to get back to people who've reached out to me and haven't even been able to respond to half of the inquiries posed to me.\n\nFirst off, I'd like to thank you guys for your support and enthusiasm. I still think you're stupid, probably stupider than me, for listening to what I have to say, but I thank you nonetheless. For those of you who had friendly (or really unfriendly) criticism, I appreciate that, too. I don't care if you're trying to hurt my feelings: if you take the time to explain in great detail, even if every word you type is laden with disdain and malicious intent, I'm oblivious enough to social cues that I'm only going to distill raw information from what you write to me. I don't care if you're a dick about it. Educate me bby.\n\nSo, I've fielded a metric fuckton of requests to start a google doc so that users can collaborate on research. I think this is a fantastic idea. This sub is full of some really fucking smart people, even if they cosplay as full-blown retards half the time. I think that if the collective autism of this sub were harnessed, it could be very productive in identifying weaknesses in the global banking system. Wisdom of the unwashed masses, and all that.\n\nThat said, I've fielded a *metric fuckton of requests*. I want this process to be as orderly as possible. That doesn't mean a discord channel that's getting spammed 30 times a second with sToNkS gO uP memes. For that reason, I'm opening up these docs generally to WSB (and hoping that they don't get fucking vandalized) as a sort of repository for leads or analyses anyone here would like to contribute. Additionally, I'm trying to identify experienced traders or economics-minded individuals who would like to trawl through the data that the sub contributes and parse it. This means financial analysts, bankers, macroeconomists, experts on fiscal policy, forex and commodity traders, and data analysts/technical analysts. Additionally, I think we might need a lawyer as well. It wouldn't hurt. If you've got this experience, please hit me up in chat and we can talk further about goals and divisions of labor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you're interested in curating this document, please drop me a chat. I might not have the time to keep it clean and organized, and delegating this responsibility would be really helpful. Experience with GitHub will be prioritized.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLastly, I really want to make one thing clear: I have not yet recommended any tickers or options yet. I've disclosed my positions, but I'm an idiot. Don't be like me. My take on this could all be wrong. That's why I'm trying to democratize this research. I'm trying my best to recruit as much knowledge and experience as I can to back any DD before I endorse any positions. That way, if you lose money, the blame is distributed. I understand that I may have glossed over nuances, or misunderstood certain aspects of the shadow banking system or repo market in my prior post. Some of these mistakes have been brought to my attention with varying degrees of nastiness. *Thank you*. I don't want to mislead or misinform anyone. Please, just keep that in mind before you launch into a vitriolic polemic. But *do* keep the constructive criticism coming. It's been very... constructive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCheers, and, again, thank you all for your knowledge and contributions and enthusiasm. Stay autistic.\n\nGo off.
