So what should we expect? Microsoft has said they are expecting a 2%-3% decline in revenue. I think that\u2019s bullshit personally. Morgan Stanley and Goldman estimate we will see more like a 20-30% decline in GDP by mid-year. \n\nI'm too retarded and lazy to figure out what that means for corporate earnings exactly, but it\u2019s a lot. Def. more than 2-3%. \n\nRight now the Shiller P/E ratio is about 24. That\u2019s still nine points above the historical median (where stocks are more or less fairly priced) of 15. In fact, there are only two periods in our history that the Shiller P/E was meaningfully higher than it is EVEN NOW: the 1929 crash and the dot com bubble-GFC. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tm25dnki0mp41.png?width=1780&format=png&auto=webp&s=43e732056ea13b101e71dfdf6a7a9085d94bf6a1\n\nSo let\u2019s go conservative and say the denominator in that ratio turns out to be 5% overvalued after Q1 earnings and will continue to decline as long as the crisis continues. Well perhaps the P/E is even a few points higher. In a crash, it always drops once the bubble pops and sentiment turns to panic. And almost always ends up below that 15-point median. It certainly never *recovers* in a recession until the worst has passed. But it might LOOK like it's climbing if lower earnings doesn't translate into a SIGNIFICANT drop in stock prices after Q1 earnings come out. \n\nAnd none of us autists are retarded enough to think we'll be seeing a slue of outperforms. Thus, sell, sell, sell.\n\nAll that translates into stocks being overvalued even now. And *bigly overvalued* in an *obvious* and measurable way once earnings start coming in. \n\nSo stonks go down. Really how much they go down depends on Washington's response. Damage will be limited if they bring all the Governors and health agencies together in an intelligent (lol), coordinated (lol), and effective (lol) containment strategy. But, seeing as the administration avoided expanding testing for the first two months of the budding crisis for the sake of some numbers, I'm not holding my breath (except when I leave home. Which I don't because I'm in NJ and it's a goddamn nightmare here). And thus, corporate earnings suffer all the more.\n\nAnd when we're talking about fundamentals, my fellow retards, we're talking about price and we're talking about earnings. And it also looks like Orange Man's planning to just, you know, [take that $500b](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/us/trump-signing-statement-coronavirus.html) that was supposed to prop up the economy anyway. So don't think that's gonna make much of a difference.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR; SPY 07/17 $150P.
