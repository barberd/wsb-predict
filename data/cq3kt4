FXI shorts are good as a hedge because China is all messed up.  HK is ready to get run over by military.  This will cause massive chaos for maybe a few days in terms of capital flight from HK/China.  Fed lowers rates in September.  Trump/Xi do trade deal to get some good news on the table for China.  China is in no position of power like before.  They could do the stall game like before, but it just takes Trump pushing HK issue for Congress to do legislation right now.  Pelosi, AOC, McConnell, and other Congresspeople are already siding with HK protesters.  Trump knows Xi is stuck here.  Xi needs something done to keep the USA at bay here.  Trump just wants a trade deal which will give the green light to let China slaughter everyone in HK.", "created_utc": 1565750580, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cq3kt4/hk_gets_screwed_over_fed_lowers_rates_in/", "is_self": true}
