The driver first of all gave me the most disgusted face when he saw I had a bucket with me and stumbling , in case I vomit on his face . The building I work at is owned 73% by Chinese . I was given corona for XMAS instead of envelopes with $$ . My cousin has sealed me in his guest room with duct tape . I feel like ET when they were gunning for his ass . My days here on earth are numbered ....\n\nDear MOM , \nI am great . They are treating me real nice here and making it comfortable for me . They give me tons of ice pops so I don\u2019t have to climb 29 stories up out a flat window of glass and fall to my death as my timbs fly off . \n\nYour son \nSkelett | Dj_Poppz", "created_utc": 1581482826, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f2lqmo/corona_got_me_yodel/", "is_self": true}
