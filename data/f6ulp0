This thing is only going to go UP once they start getting into actually giving people rides to space. Unless the entire business goes belly up or their rockets explode, this thing is going to the moon (probably literally.) In a few years, after all you noob autists have made millions of dollars, what do you think you'll do with some of your winnings? Doesn't $250k for a trip to space sound pretty damn good? They're also going to do presales like Tesla. This thing is going to be huge.
