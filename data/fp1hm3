{"id": "fp1hm3", "title": "Discussion: The \u201cRebalancing\u201d rally will not happen", "selftext": "Alright artists. \n\nMuch like the quad witching this will probably not happen too. Here\u2019s why: \n\nIn the stock market there is something called price impact which is how much the stock market moves when someone buys or sells a stock. So in order to minimise this price impact, these big funds \u201crebalancing\u201d will slice up their big fat orders into smaller orders to not affect the prices. Because if they sell off their significant positions, this will cause a severe drop in the price of the stock which they sold off partially to rebalance which will just screw up the ratio for them again and vice versa for buying. Minimising price impact also reduces losses from sale of stock and extra premium paid for stock purchases.\n\nI can\u2019t remember the terminology for the slicing up of orders to minimise price impact so it\u2019ll be good if someone knows it and I\u2019ll update it so everyone can read about it. \n\nTLDR: Funds will not buy everything at one go and induce \u201csaid rally\u201d. SPY 200P 5/15\n\nDisclaimer: I hold 4/17 200P because I\u2019m too poor to buy may puts.\n\nEDIT: \n\nThe term according to u/aspiringDILF92 is called tranches. Also as an autist I was wrong about the benchmark but please refer to his comment if you\u2019re interested.\n\nEDIT 2: \n\nAnother term people have been floating is \u201cblock trading\u201d.", "created_utc": 1585181771.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fp1hm3/discussion_the_rebalancing_rally_will_not_happen/", "is_self": true}
