The after market hours closed exactly as this shift started and I don\u2019t really understand what\u2019s going on or why no one here is talking about it.\n\nI am sure someone more autistic than me knows what the fuck is happening but this cannot be good for any stock that any of us are trading going into tomorrow.\n\nGo take a look at a S&amp;P 500 futures or NASDAQ futures tracker and everything is coming down like an avalanche.  \n\nhttps://m.investing.com/indices/us-spx-500-futures\n\nAre our tendies fucked?
