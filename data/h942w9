I'm here to present that it doesn't matter, because I have cracked the code and have an earnings play no matter the if it is bovine, carnivore, or marsupial driven this week. If you think it will be a Bullish week, calls on JBIL (the name practically has the word \"bull\" right in it). Heading into a Kangaroo week, calls on KR (it is staring you right in the face, ya that's right, KR stands for Kangaroo). If we are heading into a Bearish week, calls on SWBI. Smith and Wesson provides the firepower to take down Ursidae of all type. KR and SWBI earnings on Thursday before open, JBIL earnings on Friday before open.\n\nTL;DR: Bullish - calls on JBIL, Bearish - calls on SWBI, and Kangarooish - calls on KR.", "created_utc": 1592176616.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h942w9/truly_autistic_way_to_play_earnings_this_week_kr/", "is_self": true}
