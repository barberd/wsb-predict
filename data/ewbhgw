Let\u2019s say 10 million ppl die all over the world cuz of this virus. Sure the first thing tht comes to mind is the fact tht the negative impact it\u2019s gonna have on China n shit BUT its actually the other way. U might ask why? How could it be the other around? It\u2019s bc of GDP. GDP is the sum of household spending, gov\u2019t spending, investments and exports. In a situation like this 10 million families are gonna get insurance money. The gov\u2019t is gonna spend more to improve everything so shit like this won\u2019t happen again. Sure exports probably won\u2019t have a positive effect but the gov\u2019t and consumer spending is a lot more than that. So a positive net GDP. This means that ppl are gonna have confidence in the economy and other shit which means they are going to start doing the shit they did before the virus. Also don\u2019t say \u201cbUt iT jUsT pAsSeD sArS iN nUmBers\u201d. STFU who gives a fuck its not like 170 ppl is a lot out of 8000. It literally 2% of them. In brief, even if 10 million people die nothing will change so plz stfu and buy the dip. come to when half of the population is dead, then we can talk about how fucked we r.", "created_utc": 1580415256, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ewbhgw/the_corona_virus_could_have_a_positive_effect_in/", "is_self": true}
