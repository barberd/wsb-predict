After this was announced, KR went from trading at 28.40~ to as high as 30.70 on Tuesday when the market opened. Full transparency, I hold positions at 30C for 2/28 and 30.5C for 3/13 that I purchased at near market cost on Tuesday.\n\nWhile I could've flipped my 30C calls I purchased on Tuesday for as high as a 1,600% return at one point, that wouldn't be true WSB fashion because I'm here for the huge gains, right? Well, after doubling up on my position today when it dipped to as low as $0.24 for the 30C options, I'm prepped for the rebound after this dip to 29.54 today.\n\nThis coupled with their Expected EPS of 0.56 (up from 0.47) to be reported on 3/5 is looking to make some big tendies in the week leading up to EPS pre-market. I'm sure the 2/28 30C will be shooting up pretty high from their current dip in anticipation for that.\n\nI'm feeling good about this because I've held NVDA through the dip to 232 and saw the gains through 290C, not that that has any relation really but the gut hasn't failed me yet.
