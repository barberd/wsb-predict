But SPY isn't made up of unemployment, GDP, housing starts, wage growth, MBS, etc.\n\nAlmost 20% of the S&P 500 is made up by FAGMA. And the tech industry isn't getting hit nearly as hard right now as manufacturing and service industries.\n\nIn the COVID world, E-commerce is going to dominate & online advertising is going to be paramount. So Google, Facebook, & Amazon are going to keep raking in cash. Apple will take a hit on B2C hardware sales next quarter, and its supply chain is fucked right now. Microsoft is a coin flip.\n\nThe S&P (and even the stock market as a whole) isn't a good real-time proxy for the economy anymore. All the medium sized companies need time to burn out through Q2, then it will hit like a ton of bricks. And then there if there is not a second wave in the summer, next winter will be hell (assuming no vaccine).\n\nEveryone is talking about a slow \"recovery\", but it's actually a slow burn, as economic activity tries to restart but we cannot quite get there. (I would say the \"recovery\" is almost priced in rn).\n\nWait until July/August to buy puts. Or don't, because I have no fucking clue what I am talking about.", "created_utc": 1588203467.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gaki0w/spy_is_not_a_proxy_for_the_economy/", "is_self": true}
