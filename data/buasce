President Donald Trump warned on Monday that US tariffs on goods from China could still \u201cgo up very, very substantially, very easily\u201d.\n\nThe signal from the widely-watched US yield curve, whose inversion has been a reliable indicator of past recessions, also intensified investor nervousness on Tuesday, because long-dated Treasury yields slid further below yields on shorter-dated government debt.\n\nThe difference between three-month and 10-year Treasury yields dropped as low as minus-9 basis points, nearing the year to date low of minus-11 bps. This measure of the yield curve has turned negative before every US recession of the past 50 years.\n\nCiti\u2019s global economic surprise index, which measures whether data are coming in better or worse relative to expectations, has been in negative territory for more than a year \u2014 its longest stint below zero on record. That has led analysts to pare their forecasts for global growth this year, to a median estimate of 3.3 per cent in 2019. This would be the slowest rate of expansion since 2009.\n\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley warned that, after adjusting for the effects of the unprecedented unwinding of the Fed\u2019s post-financial crisis bond buying program, the yield curve has effectively been inverted since November 2018.\n\n\u201cWe think this means the US economic slowdown and rising recession risk is happening regardless of the trade outcome,\u201d the equity strategists, led by Michael Wilson, wrote.\n\nThe Fed\u00a0has avoided\u00a0any indication that cuts are coming. Minutes of its most recent meeting, held on April 30 and May 1 before the latest round of tit-for-tat tariffs were announced, suggested that there was no immediate plan to move interest rates either higher or lower. Speeches from policymakers in recent weeks have reiterated the central bank\u2019s \u201cpatient\u201d approach.\n\nIn spite of the Fed\u2019s stance, investors\u2019 are anticipating that the central bank will have to ease its monetary policy.\n\n\u201cOne cut is likely. I would not be surprised if we see two,\u201d said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. \u201cA lot of it depends on how much of a deterioration we see in the economic data. But just the breakdown in relations between the US and China is good for one rate cut.\u201d", "created_utc": 1559108080, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/buasce/ft_investors_raise_bets_on_fed_making_two_rate/", "is_self": true}
