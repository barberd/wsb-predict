So when I saw D Pump make an announcement today about reopening the economy I bought some 4/17 TNA calls that I was going to sell tomorrow but I forgot I won\u2019t be able to sell them when the market opens and I yolo\u2019d everything in my RH account but that\u2019s not saying much. Anyway, I signed up for RH Gold and it gave me the instant deposit I needed to exercise 1 call. Assuming they\u2019re still in the money tomorrow I can just exercise 1 call at a time until I have enough to exercise 2 calls at a time and so forth right?\n\nEDIT: TNA not TZA - My bad I\u2019ve been buying and selling them the next day for awhile now and still fucked it up", "created_utc": 1587079676.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2qbac/wtf_do_i_do_with_my_calls_tomorrow/", "is_self": true}
