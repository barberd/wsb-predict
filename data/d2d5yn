{"id": "d2d5yn", "title": "$DIS Over Reaction From APPL", "selftext": "Does anyone else feel this is a bit of an over reaction from the APPL event? I mean APPL is only up .22% on this news? Literally .50 compared to DIS being down close to 3%. Disney had 2 billion dollar movies this summer and there streaming service literally broke there website when they offered the \"buy ahead\" deal for the 3 years. I hold 11/15  135 C and just averaged down and bought 2 more. Does anyone else feel this is a huge buying opportunity for some cheap calls? Who else jumped in on some DIS plays with me today?", "created_utc": 1568144634, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d2d5yn/dis_over_reaction_from_appl/", "is_self": true}
