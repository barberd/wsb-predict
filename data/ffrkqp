So while everyone is nutting all over their keyboards, I am sitting quietly, eyeballing Robinhood and not the premarket. So far it is 1:22am PDT, and I dont know how many west coast gang RH users are out there, but 1:10am PDT is usually when Robinhood updates. Unless they are doing their daily turning it off and turning it back on for their servers which they call  \"maintenance,\" expect that copy pasta \"....We're so sorry this is happening  to you!\" email along with your useless subscription to gold email real soon. Thats right, DIAMOND HAND FEATURES IS BACK. All yall poor fks who bought calls EOD friday on that micro PP pump will be sending more emails to RH tomorrow as you bleed out, and eventually be ignored.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOr Im just doubting Robinhood and I am retarded. will be fun to see how this plays out", "created_utc": 1583742433, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffrkqp/prayers_to_robinhood_users/", "is_self": true}
