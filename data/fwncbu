{"id": "fwncbu", "title": "Luckin Coffee PT.2, the 16 $IQ p/lay", "selftext": "tldr: IQ 16p 4/17\n\nMuddy Waters Research (aka [short activist Carson Block](https://www.muddywatersresearch.com/about/)) released a now-famous [anonymous report](https://twitter.com/muddywatersre/status/1223274746017722371) on $LK on January 31st claiming that Luckin Coffee was committing accounting fraud and straight up fabricating transactions.\n\nIt took almost two months, but LK finally dropped and has gone from trading at $37 prior to the report to now $4.39 and will likely be both delisted and subject to a class action lawsuit.\n\nEnter $IQ, the [Netflix of China](https://wolfpackresearch.com/iq-netflix-of-china-good-luckin/). [Muddy Waters is today reporting](https://twitter.com/muddywatersre/status/1247534498939465731) that iQIYI is committing a few different kinds of fraud:\n\n* They've inflated their 2019 revenue by somewhere between 27%-44%\n* They've overstated their user numbers by 42%-60%\n* They've inflated their expenses, the prices it pays for content, and other assets and acquisitions in order to hide the revenue they don't have\n\nThe problem with overstating your revenue is the money has to be somewhere, so you're stuck with also overstating expenses. This gives researchers two points of attack to figure out if your financials are accurate: the revenue side and the expense side. Muddy Waters has found evidence of serious fraud on both ends.\n\n[Full report here](https://wolfpackresearch.com/download/iqiyi-the-netflix-of-china-good-luckin/).\n\nIt took $LK 2 months or so to seriously drop, but it's my belief in the wake of their nosedive that accusations of Chinese firms with serious accounting issues will accelerate and we'll see much faster price action in the next week on $IQ. \n\nIf you disagree, buy longer dated puts.
