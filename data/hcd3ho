{"id": "hcd3ho", "title": "[$BYND] Beyond Meat has an indefensible position in the Consumer Defensive sector.", "selftext": "Beyond Meat is not a favorable play over the next few years because the factors driving its generous pricing ($158.28 per share, F/PE 277) will only weaken as direct competitors go public and proven competitors grow market share.\n\nSimilar to Virgin Galactic existing as the only public space tourism company, Beyond Meat is the only public company solely producing plant-based meat alternatives. This has multiple major implications. Since going public, Beyond Meat has seen considerable price appreciation simply because other meatless competitors, like Kellogg, Kraft Heinz, and Tyson aren't solely devoted to producing plant-based meat alternatives, thus BYND is seen as a pure play in the sustainable food space. Because of this favorable positioning, BYND benefits from multiple types of catalysts that inflate their stock price.\n\n1. Because of the limited environment for investing in plant-based meat producers (i.e. the only public one), Beyond Meat is inherently the go-to purchase for investors, which artificially drives up stock price. As competitors like Impossible Burger consider going public, and public competitors like Tyson, Kellogg, and Kraft Heinz grow their R&D and production of plant-based products, BYND loses this unique investment advantage and will see less price appreciation as a result.\n2. Because of the limited environment for investing in plant-based meat alternatives (and point #1), Beyond Meat's share price irrationally appreciates when the general industry receives favorable news. Similar to point #1, as the number of investment vehicles for this industry grow in number, the upside of favorable industry developments weakens.\n\nConsidering #1 and #2, even if Beyond is able to gain [mainstream adoption](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/beyond-meats-stock-is-wildly-overpriced-even-if-business-expands-perfectly-2020-05-08) as a permanent alternative to meat over the next few years, increasing players in the space will average out the \"hype\" that has driven this inflated stock price. With an average P/E ratio of 25 among Consumer Defensive companies, Beyond's $10 billion dollar valuation and F/PE of 267 only has room to decrease, as juggernaut competitors have greater cash flow to fund development and expansion of meat alternatives.\n\nI would monitor the sector for catalysts (to the downside) in events like IPOs, significant developments in the sales/profitability of publicly traded competitors' plant-based meat sales, and new competitors altogether.", "created_utc": 1592615804.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hcd3ho/bynd_beyond_meat_has_an_indefensible_position_in/", "is_self": true}
