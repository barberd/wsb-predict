Keep reading if you want to decide for yourself.\n\nEdit 2: Trade looks good still. Apparently that was not enough liquidity based on the action afterwards. Also made less wordy.\n\nI watch the treasury market quite a bit and it seems to have broken on 3/8. My hypothesis is that a liquidity crunch is forcing selling even as those positions are deep in the money and should have been \"safe.\"\n\nWith the recent market route bonds should have continued to rise (with their yields falling), but instead they had a massive reversal with both an all time rise and then drop within three trading days.\n\nIf you have any thoughts on why the treasury market is acting like this that I have not outlined then mention them in the comments and I will add them in.\n\n**Why are treasuries falling after 3/8 instead of being a safe haven?**\n\n1. Margin call?\n\nThere could have been a very large long bond/long (leveraged) stocks play that got margin called on 3/8, but that shouldn't have continued on the 10th, 11th, and today. Granted todays move is quite muted.\n\n2. Selling treasuries to buy stocks?\n\nMaybe on 3/8 and 3/10, but that doesn't explain 3/9 and today when bonds and stocks were sold off.\n\n3. Fallout from the oil market and these bond sellers are sniffing long-term damage to the petrodollar?\n\nMaybe. I don't know how to support or disprove that thesis.\n\n4. liquidity crunch?\n\nYes. We know from the repo market that there has been one simmering for some months now, and we know that banks suddenly had to scramble on 3/8 to inject more liquidity to meet the minimum funding levels required by law after their oil loans took such a hit.\n\n**How to profit?**\n\nWager on treasuries, especially long duration, falling sharply with a climb in yields. TLT, or any of the 3x bear/bull instruments could be used.\n\nI opened some puts on TLT 3/20 @ 136. They were .13 when I got in and some deals to be had if you check each strike as they were not very reasonably arrayed.\n\nThe Fed has a meeting on 3/18 where I assume they will cut rates, so I would exit this position before they speak, or at least take some profits.", "created_utc": 1584032062.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhjgol/puts_on_long_duration_treasuries_tlt_tmv_tyo_etc/", "is_self": true}
