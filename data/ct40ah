{"id": "ct40ah", "title": "DD for best buy earnings", "selftext": "Bullish: BBY stopped working there but this is all public information. So SEC don\u2019t come at me. Best Buy has seen a lot of foot traffic as of recently on accessories and credit cards and total tech support and protection plans. All of which are how they make major amounts of money. They do not make really any money on major hardware and appliances. They sell a lot of hardware with accessories attached which is also were they make money. I have 6 call contracts expiring August 30th when earnings are the 29th pre-market. Also best buy has had a recent drop of about 7$ for no real reason beside the entire market dropping that much. And under new management they have improved some business models. I\u2019m expecting atleast a 1-2% gain in the next week or so and a 4-5% gain on earnings bring its share price to about a 70.5$ price on earnings day with a run up same day around 1% bring it to 71.2$ per share. They are the only retailer that can actually out do amazon because with big ticket items people want to see a tv first before they buy it.\n\nTL:DR BUY CALLS ON BBY prior to earnings iv isn\u2019t that high so buy soon.
