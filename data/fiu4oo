{"id": "fiu4oo", "title": "Oil Tendie Tycoon", "selftext": "$GASL CALL - Any Strike Any Date \n\n$GUSH CALL - Any Strike Any Date\n\nI've been high on adderall all weekend doing deep research following Trumps Friday Commercial. I may be wrong, but I got a plan, and was going to share it with you people so you can tell me Im fucking retarded.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst:  OIL / GAS has taken a SHIT as everyone knows from the Saudi/Russia war. (Buying opportunity long term). Trump also mentioned about buying oil here in \"massive amounts.\"  Everyone here is  talking about $USO, which is great, but there is something better me thinks...  introducing.....\n\n$**GUSH**: DIREXION SHARES ETF TRUST DAILY S&P OIL & GAS EXP & PRD BUL 3X\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/AMEX-GUSH/](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/AMEX-GUSH/)\n\n[https://www.direxion.com/products/daily-sp-oil-gas-exp-prod-bull-3x-shares](https://www.direxion.com/products/daily-sp-oil-gas-exp-prod-bull-3x-shares)\n\nand\n\n$**GASL**:  DIREXION SHARES ETF TRUST NATURAL GAS RELATED BULL 3X SHARES\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/AMEX-GASL/](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/AMEX-GASL/)\n\n[https://www.direxion.com/products/direxion-daily-natural-gas-related-bull-3x-etf](https://www.direxion.com/products/direxion-daily-natural-gas-related-bull-3x-etf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDD:  These are two 3x leveraged Investment Trust Mutual funds at an ALL TIME LOW.  Im talking fucking 11 cents from once in the thousands years ago. These two funds are lightly traded ETFs on [https://www.direxion.com/etfs](https://www.direxion.com/etfs) but already had a spike in volume and interest on Friday (up 50%) .  They were both trading almost 1200% Higher than current values a couple weeks ago before the Oil war.  These funds are made up of underlying shares in shit like Chevron etc...They also still pay some boomer shit called dividends  (what those things??)\n\nAnyhow, I think scooping up a bunch of these CALLS at any strike and any date you can get your hands on may print MAD tendies. IF saudi/russia come to an agreement, or Trump starts buying stuff, or even mentions stuff about buying stuff...it Cant really go tits up. .its already near zero....  worse case you loose a few fuckin bucks..", "created_utc": 1584238550.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fiu4oo/oil_tendie_tycoon/", "is_self": true}
