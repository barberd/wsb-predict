Assemble your combined IQ of 5 and follow along.\n\n I\u2019m pulling my fucking money out of RH, and I\u2019ve put in a full withdrawal request 7 times already. They keep fucking going through so when robinhoods servers stop shitting themselves I might get 7x my money into my account.\n\n Now, by all no means should this ACTUALLY work but let\u2019s be honest, it\u2019s fucking Robinhood we\u2019re talking about here, they\u2019re the only thing more retarded than us. So go open your fucking app, go withdraw ALL your money 20 fucking times and either we all makeup for the sins of our yolos or we crash their servers again.
