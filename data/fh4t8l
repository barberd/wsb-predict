I've been in the HVAC industry for a very long time and we do the big boy stuff like at hospitals, sky rises and manufacturing plants etc. We are such an afterthought of an industry and are very unappreciated.\n\nToday, I received email correspondence from our President that no social gatherings are permitted while on the clock and only customer site visits are permitted.  Unfortunately in this pandemic, OSHA is a big deal to our industry and there is a clause about safe working environments giving the worker ultimate protection in the case of an unsafe one. What this means is that in the event of unsafe working conditions(CV)they cannot be forced to work and protected. \n\nI say all this because if the HVAC goes...your grocery store cases go, your operating rooms go, your data centers go, tech goes, your cell towers go...you get the point. We literally hold the fabric of the world together. If your tech goes, you wont be able to trade. You also can't pull money out of your bank. You better hope like shit this is over quickly or we might just hit the reset button. \n\nI will say this, if it came down to it I would set this phone down in a heart beat and put my field uniform back on to keep people communicating, eating and safe. It will be interesting to see how things go when you don't have heating, cooling and refrigeration.\n\nTldr: Any strike put 4/17 or further out $EME, $TT, $SPXC, $JCI", "created_utc": 1583962369.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fh4t8l/heating_and_airconditioning_insider_info_for/", "is_self": true}
