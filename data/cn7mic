{"id": "cn7mic", "title": "Over trading", "selftext": "Made $4k this morning in like 20 mins, then got greedy and lost it all.\n\nBut after 13 day trades between msft calls and FB puts, I\u2019m finally up $2.7k today.\n\nI honestly have a problem of overtrading. \n\nSo what happened was it took me one trade to make $4k but then I lost it all on the other 5 trades I entered after. I then made it all back with MSFT calls and I was up $2.5k.  Then guess what when I heard WH gonna fuck with Huawei I bought puts but didn\u2019t get the reaction I expected and lost that $2.5K plus $300 more. I then bought FB puts and this time I held it and sold it for $3k. Making my profit for today $2.7K.\n\nI\u2019ve noticed that I have an issue with over trading, I usually make a decent profit on my first trade of the day but then I start losing it all by executing multiple trades.
