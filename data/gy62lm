{"id": "gy62lm", "title": "Basic Introduction to SPACs", "selftext": "**What is an SPAC?**\n\nSpecial Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs) are also called \u201cblank check companies\u201d because they IPO without having any actual business operations. They raise a chunk of change with their IPO, and **they get two years to acquire a company and bring it public** via a \u201creverse merger\u201d. Companies aiming to go public with this route are typically 1x-5x larger in terms of market cap than the SPAC itself. \n\nThe money they raise in their IPO is placed into a trust that has two purposes: acquisition purchases, or liquidate and return investors their money. So, in practice, these companies will typically have a $10 floor on their share price, as that is what must be paid out to investors if the company does not successfully reach a deal. Shares are a highly speculative, but relatively safe investment if you\u2019re investing early. \n\nNow, I know all of you have heard of a little company called SPCE. Well, before it was Virgin Galactic, it was an SPAC trading under the ticker IPOA. With a $720 million IPO, it was on the larger side of SPACs which meant a lot more potential, and it ended up striking gold. Imagine getting in on SPCE way before anyone had heard of it. \n\nExample 2: DKNG. You all may be slightly more familiar with this, but a similar story. DEAC IPO\u2019ed at $400 million, which is almost half the size of the former but yielded a near identical result. \n\nThird and final example: NKLA. Now I know we\u2019re all familiar with what happened here. VTIQ IPO\u2019ed raising just $230 million. The smallest on this list, with very similar results as SPCE and DKNG. These are long-term speculative plays but they all have one thing in common: a solid company with a plan for the future that went public via a reverse merger with a SPAC. \n\n**Shares, Warrants, & Units**\n\nAll right. If you\u2019ve made it this far, you may be wondering how in the heck can I get in on the ground floor of these companies, and I\u2019m here to tell you. When a SPAC IPOs, typically its first offering will be of \u201cunits\u201d, which I had previously never heard of. These units consist of one share and a fraction of a warrant, usually a third. That\u2019s great and all, but if you don\u2019t know what a warrant is, I\u2019ll try to explain briefly.\n\nA warrant is like an option, except it\u2019s traded like a stock. IPOA.WS, DEACW, and VTIQW are all the warrants for the aforementioned SPACs. These warrants provide the owner the right (but not the obligation) to purchase one share of the underlying company at a predetermined price (typically the strike price is 11.50, just because) per warrant owned. Warrants have a few benefits: first, they\u2019re far cheaper. You can get away with investing a tenth of the capital in the same company, for what equates to 10x the potential gains. Second, warrants often have some intrinsic value when you purchase them. The warrant price + the exercise price frequently is less than the share price, which would result in arbitrage *except* for the fact that there is usually a waiting period before warrants can be exercised. \n\nSo, with three different choices (shares, warrants, and units) there is a way to invest for everyone. Loading up on warrants would be a true WSB maneuver, while shares would provide that $10 floor for a nice safety net in case the company fails. Units serve as a beautiful combination of the two, which allow you to safely invest while adding just a tiny bit of leverage.\n\n**New SPACs**\n\nNow that we all know the basics, let\u2019s take a look at some of the names floating around right now in the wake of the three ultra-successful ones this past year. I\u2019ll include three that I find interesting, and if there\u2019s any interest I\u2019d be happy to make a post regarding the other 10 I\u2019m watching.\n\n**FMCI(W)**\n\nForum Merger II Corporation IPO\u2019ed raising 150 million a while back, and after a few teases, they\u2019re announcing the company they\u2019ll be acquiring on Monday,  6/8. After announcing that the company would be *\u201ca high-growth, plant-based food company\u2026 sold through leading retailers and distributors across the United States\u201d,* there was a lot of speculation and hype about it being Impossible Foods, which pumped their stock quite a bit. While a merger with Impossible Foods is highly unlikely, the evidence points more towards a company named JUST. (This is my opinion and pure speculation, to be confirmed on Monday). This would be almost as good as Impossible and maybe even better for investors long-term. Assuming the stock falls when they announce any company other than Impossible, any dip would provide a nice entry point.\n\n**KBLM(W)**\n\nKBLM is an interesting play because it\u2019s warrants are dirt cheap. Like, nine-cents-per cheap. They\u2019ve already announced who they\u2019re acquiring, which puts it at a later stage in the process than FMCI, but they haven\u2019t technically voted to approve it. This vote takes place on 7/9, next month. They\u2019re merging with CannBioRx, a pharmaceutical company that aims to treat chronic pain with non-psychoactive cannabinoids, aka not THC which is the active ingredient in marijuana. A quick browse over their website ([https://cannbiorx.com/about/](https://cannbiorx.com/about/)) will be more helpful, but they have a truly world-class team and IMO a ton of potential to grow.\n\n**CCXX(/WS)**\n\nThis last one is special. Churchill Capital Corp III IPO\u2019ed in February, raising a whopping ***$1.1 billion***. Back to some stuff from earlier: first of all, they have no company to merge with yet. That means we have 22 months to find a company, and with over a billion to play with, it\u2019ll be a whale. Second, it\u2019s headed up by one Micheal Klein. He is a decorated figure in the financial sector, and has already brought a moderately sized SPAC (Churchill Capital Corp I) a very successful merger and has another SPAC in the works (CCC II). The buzz this massive IPO generated has been growing, but it still hasn\u2019t caught on as much as the meme SPACs we\u2019ve already seen this year. With 5x more funds than VTIQ, as soon as any news of a merger hits this thing is going to the moon. \n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nSPACs are like mystery boxes. With ultra-cheap warrants, and not a whole lot of downside on shares, they\u2019ll almost be like a savings account in the absolute worst case scenarios. However, they\u2019re becoming way more popular and with the successes of the earlier mentioned stocks I believe this sector is just getting started. There have been somewhere around 30 IPOs this year so far, which is far more than we\u2019ve ever seen in the past, and if they continue to bring us meme stocks and long plays like they have been, they\u2019re here to stay.\n\nDo your own research, or don\u2019t, but I heavily recommend hopping in on some of these companies before they find a target for their merger, because odds are it\u2019ll cause a nice rally. \n\n**TL;DR**\n\nSPACs brought us SPCE, DKNG, and NKLA. Get in on them before they even find a company to acquire, and print some nice tendies. \n\n**Positions**\n\nAVCTW\n\nKBLMW\n\nFMCIW\n\nFEACW\n\nAnd looking at about 13 other SPACs to get in on in the coming weeks. If you're interested, check out the SPAC sub (r/SPACs) and mods: I apologize if some of these have too small of market caps, but my stakes are not huge in these companies and I in no way want to pump them. Just excited about a new (to me) type of investing that I think is fun and worthy of WSB attention.", "created_utc": 1591505119.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gy62lm/basic_introduction_to_spacs/", "is_self": true}
