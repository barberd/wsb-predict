But what about mailing your shit?\n\nYou could mail a steaming turd to an enemy and get nothing for it, or you could mail a steaming turd to us and have a 92% reduction in your risk of colon cancer.\n\nPersonally, I like those odds, now listen up you reckless tendy loving animals. The name of the company is Exact Sciences (EXAS). It\u2019s a cutting-edge high tech molecular diagnostics company out of the Midwest. Their main prospect is a revolutionary non-invasive colon cancer detection product you can use from the comfort of your own home.

And BOOM 92% less risk.\u00a0\u00a0Think about it would you rather have your doctor shove a camera WAAAAY up your ass, or smirk while waiting in line at the post office?\n\n\nNow I shit you not Cologuard sales are up 63%.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone else smell tendies?
