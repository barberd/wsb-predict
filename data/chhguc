I've never made an options play that was truly 100% the right call. What's the best way to go about calculating what this option will be worth? Its $257.50 put exp 8/2 . From what I can tell the option has about $5700 more implied value now. I paid $800 for it.\n\nAlso , anyone got an DD for options plays for tomorrow. I'm trying to parlay this win into a downpayment.", "created_utc": 1564020164, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/chhguc/bought_algn_puts_today_finally_hit_the_nail_on/", "is_self": true}
