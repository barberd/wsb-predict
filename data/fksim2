{"id": "fksim2", "title": "Instant Deposit stole my tendies", "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nHere is evidence of a bug having to do with Robinhood's Instant Deposit feature whereby **cash disappears from your account**. This has happened twice so far yesterday (3/17) for a net loss of $20,000 cash, the first time for 15k, the second for 5k. The evidence pertaining to the second occurrence is most solid because at the time I had no open positions to which one might attribute this loss. The timeline is as follows on 3/17/20:\n\n* 12:22pm: screenshot of account at $17,232.84. All cash, no open positions.\n* 10:06pm: screenshot of account at $12,232,84, exactly 5k less. This was not due to loss, withdrawal, or margin payment.\n* 10:06pm: screenshot of message from RH showing my instant deposit limit decreased from 10k to 5k.\n* 10:06pm: screenshot of all withdrawals. There is no ongoing withdrawal for 5k that would account for this drop.\n\nPROOF -> https://imgur.com/gallery/MqzACKy\n\nNow I *had* withdrawn 10k *earlier in the day*, but as we all know, withdrawals are reflected immediately on your Robinhood account balance. This has nothing to do with that earlier withdrawal. I've opened various support tickets with Robinhood to no avail. This is not the only bug I've seen in the past few days. Check out [this description] (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fivlm3/robinhood_purchased_1000_shares_of_biib_on_my/) of a case where Robinhood erroneously purchased $300,000 worth of random stock on someone's behalf, without that person ever having placed an order for that stock.\n\ntldr; There is a bug in Robinhood and when your Instant Deposit limit drops, your own cash disappears. This is essentially theft. There may be more bugs.", "created_utc": 1584549523.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fksim2/instant_deposit_stole_my_tendies/", "is_self": true}
