I now realize why so 9.95/10 of you autists on here lose all your money. My last attempt was guessing AMD would go up because of E3. \n\nIn it's simplest form, options to me means you're better on a stock to go up or down within a certain period of time. Robinhood has this really nice \\*discovery\\* feature that makes it easier to lose money. If you're not familiar with it, it basically asks you if you think the stock is going to go up, down or sideways (It even uses really cool names, like \"Iron Condor\" to make you feel right at home). It then lays out choices for you that takes all the guess work out of actually understanding options, making it family friendly for even your 5th grade brother can lose all his fortnite money.\n\nHave I been successful at trading? Yes. In 09, where everybody was. I bought random shit and held and make 2-3-4-500% gains within 2 years. On Ford, 1200%.\n\nSo here is my method - Could someone just wait for the next recession, let the market pull back 30-50%, and then trade options using Robinhood's discovery feature (\"I think this stock is going to go up\") to bet that companies like Microsoft, Walmart, McDonald's are going to go up within 1-2-3 years? It seems like there's a 1% chance these stocks wouldn't go up, then we can all feel like winners :)", "created_utc": 1561331884, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c4e73n/on_a_scale_from_retard_to_full_retard_how/", "is_self": true}
