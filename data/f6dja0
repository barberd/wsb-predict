{"id": "f6dja0", "title": "Domino's Pizza 2/20/2020 BMO", "selftext": " \n\nStock**: Domino\u2019s Pizza (DPZ)**\n\nDirection**:** **Mixed Bearish**\n\n**Price Target:** **270$**\n\nType**:** **Call Credit Spread**\n\n**Fundamental:** Dominos has been treading towards all time high stock prices even though the last 2 quarters had lackluster results, focusing on weaker revenues and slower same store sales growth, especially in the united states. Domino\u2019s sports a higher than average short interest, which heightens upward risk. There have been rumors regarding a special dividend and/or additional stock buybacks. These 3 factors will make DPZ\u2019s earnings much less clear.\n\n**Technical**: Priced above in 20, 50, 200 day moving averages.  MACD shows bearish divergence. RSI shows around 60, moving towards overbought. Options sentiments are very bullish in volume and neutral  in open interest. Implied movement of about 5.8% or 17.30$.\n\n**Sentimental**: DPZ has been on a tear, coming from a september low of 230 to almost 300$ before earnings. Going into this quarter, EPS is expecting to show a 10%+ YoY growth. The main concern here is the lackluster performance last 2 quarters and the continued strength of delivery networks eroding DPZ\u2019s delivery strength. Wildcard here would be a special dividend payout that will stabilize the stock price or even send the stock upwards.\n\n**ROI: 18%**\n\n**Risk Level: 4 out of 5, Very Risky**\n\n**Sell 3/6 320 call Buy 3/6 325 call**\n\n[Robinhood SS](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/678294460425306197/679732169404710922/image0.png?width=377&amp;height=669)", "created_utc": 1582131333, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6dja0/dominos_pizza_2202020_bmo/", "is_self": true}
