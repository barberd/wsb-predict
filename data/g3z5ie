The jade lizard is a spread that will allow you to take advantage of the inherent larger IV on puts while simultaneously hedging you further from downsides via the sale of a call credit spread.\n\nHow does it work? You write a cash secured put as well as a call credit spread on a security. For instance, for the week that just passed, I wrote a 56.5 put on SQ and simultaneously sold the 61.5/62 call credit spread. I closed the spread at 50% profit.\n\nFor May 15, I\u2019m looking at MSFT as well as MGM. Personally, I\u2019m an ultra msft bull and wouldn\u2019t mind getting assigned a 100 satya shares. I\u2019m also happy holding MGM shares, and the IV for puts is crazy. Personally, for MGM, it seems that weekly options will also give you quite lucrative returns with relatively little risk. Twitter is also a good stock for this as well as AMD. Basically, you wanna do this on a stock u wouldn\u2019t mind holding. I\u2019m bullish on all the tickers above but also don\u2019t wanna go full bull mode hence this mildly bullish trade. Puts still carry crazy premiums so take advantage of this.", "created_utc": 1587259802.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g3z5ie/why_you_should_be_writing_jade_lizards_in_this/", "is_self": true}
