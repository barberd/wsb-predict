I wont mention the share price because automod is deleting my posts, but it's very cheap. The US section 232 ruling is fast approaching and most \"insiders\" suggest it's going to pass. At the latest we're looking at July. This gives the US uranium market an immediate, and required 25% market share. Right now it has a 0% required market share. There are only two legitimate US players and URG has the cheapest production.\n\nWhen 232 is passed, this will move parabolic. If it doesn't pass, you still have shares to dump and no time decay. \n\nMods, can you allow this? It's a legitimate play, not a faggy penny stock pipe dream.", "created_utc": 1559745288, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bx39eo/uranium_mining_shares_as_an_option_play_without/", "is_self": true}
