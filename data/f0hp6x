It is trading below this price because any shares over this amount is not guaranteed to be purchased and thus is a high risk of being worth a lot less after the sell. But as long as you buy 99 shares or less and tender those you won\u2019t have to worry about it.", "created_utc": 1581112820, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f0hp6x/600_for_anyone_xbit_tender_offer/", "is_self": true}
