Purple CEO Joe Megibow recently gave [this podcasting interview](https://www.spreaker.com/user/9041999/valley-voice-podcast-ep-9-purple-ceo-on-).  Let's dissect some of the juicy tidbits given.\n\n# Q1 was baked:  Wholesale accelerated\n\nIf you have been following this stock at all, you know that growth of the wholesale channel through partners like Mattress Firm are the reason the stock price was accelerating pre-COVID over the previous few months as EBITDA and then earnings started going positive ***while sales were accelerating***.\n\nAs of Q4, PRPL only occupied 1,800 doors out of the potential 5,825 doors of partners, who are begging for expansion.   PRPL is manufacturing capacity constrained and they sell every mattress they make (go listen to the Q4 call to hear this).  PRPL also said it only needed to add 900 wholesale doors to meet its full year sale growth plan (pre-COVID).   Wholesale is critical to understand the valuation of PRPL.\n\nFrom the podcast, we learned that wholesale revenue has accelerated to 50% of sales (an increase from 36% of net revenue from Q4). We know that wholesale revenue was unaffected up until the 3/9 earnings call, per the earnings call. As of 3/26, PRPL still had [half of their wholesale doors](https://investors.purple.com/press-releases/news-details/2020/Purple-Innovation-Withdraws-2020-Guidance-Due-to-COVID-19-Impact/default.aspx) operating. \n\nTherefore, and similar to many other companies, Q1 should be almost fully baked for PRPL.  Couple this with [the potential accrual reversal for warrant liabilities I describe here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g30vst/covid_recovery_play_prpl_to_1214_by_512_and_2024/), and we should see a solid beat for Q1 earnings.\n\n[Earnings consensus from Marketbeat.com:](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/PRPL/earnings/)\n\n[Consensus from Marketbeat.com](https://preview.redd.it/w8ajknwsssx41.png?width=1359&format=png&auto=webp&s=72b848383e0687481faf19cb05c8e4fbd66fabef)\n\nConsensus estimate per Marketbeat for Q1 Earnings is only $0.01 per share, which is very low considering that PRPL originally guided to $44M-$49M in Adj EBITDA for the year.   This guidance has since been pulled, but remember that Q1 was mostly baked and earnings was on 3/9, when most of the quarter was done.\n\n[Earnings consensus from Yahoo Finance:](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PRPL/analysis?p=PRPL)\n\n[Consensus from Yahoo Finance](https://preview.redd.it/etrfpmoqxsx41.png?width=914&format=png&auto=webp&s=048575d19e1f96523d70d4b232890f2bf942a5ef)\n\nYahoo puts the consensus higher at $0.05, but that is still pretty low considering Q1 being baked.\n\n# Online sales have skyrocketed!\n\nOn the podcast, Joe said that ***online sales have skyrocketed***. We can infer that these sales have largely offset the drop off in wholesale sales from store closings as ***90% of the previous furloughed workforce has already been recalled*** as of two weeks ago. PRPL only furloughed [35% of their workforce](https://investors.purple.com/press-releases/news-details/2020/Purple-Innovation-Provides-COVID-19-Related-Business-Update/default.aspx) anyways, so that means they are back operating with 96.5% of their workforce (The math is 35%\\*90% = 31.5% of workforce returned.  65% of unfurloughed workforce + 31.5% workforce returned = 96.5% of pre-COVID workforce).\n\nPRPL was banking on wholesale sales to drive 2021.  If Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) has picked up the capacity to get the team back to 96.5% capacity, then we might actually see PRPL ***beat*** original guidance on a go forward basis (with consideration of the 2-3 weeks manufacturing capacity was down) as DTC has more revenue and product margin per unit sold versus wholesale.\n\nI had put PRPL at $12-14 per share pre-earnings and was looking at $15-17 post earnings without the above information.  How big the shift into DTC has been can drive this stock up massively.\n\n# Job openings on the Purple Career site are accelerating\n\nA friend and I have been watching the job openings on the Purple careers site for the past few weeks, and new job postings are starting to happen again.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0zap30jrwsx41.png?width=144&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd212c191708aa1b80d9add28a78934738355288\n\nPurple is in the full swing of hiring again.  What's interesting is that, as of early this week, we started seeing manufacturing positions open up again.   It is likely that this is another confirming sign that Purple is again boosting their manufacturing capacity.\n\n# Stupidly high short interest will drive a squeeze\n\nIt would have been nice to get 4/30's numbers for this, but they come out at the same time as the ER.   If the ER is as good as I think it will be, we will be able to better understand this on the overnight.\n\nAs of 4/15/2020, the short interest is 8.03% of float; however, [83.56% of float is held long by institutions](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PRPL/holders?p=PRPL), which leaves only 16.44% left with non-institutionals.   Some of those institutions hold large chunks of float (look at you Coliseum Capital with 34.82% on 12/30/2019) and have been in a very long time (CC is on the board).\n\nShort interest as a percentage of non-institutional float is extremely high and could cause a squeeze, which will amplify an earnings beat.\n\n# Trading volume on the stock vs the warrants\n\nPRPL is not a meme stock with ridiculous volumes, but that shouldn't get your panties in a bunch if you are playing for fundamentals and not day trading bollinger bands.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7vm09z8d2tx41.png?width=346&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ef32c12caee555ff6ebcaea1d6078e0bcfcf320\n\nAlmost a million shares traded hands on Friday, which is above the average 461k over the last 30 days.    I would expect similar volumes before and after earnings.  This isn't a top 50 S&P 500 stock, but it does have more volume than many on the S&P.   This is typical for a mid-market stock.\n\nThere are no options yet for PRPL, but there are long half warrants, which are the same thing as call options for people who can put letters together in their head to understand another human's thoughts.  Go read the S3 filing on the warrants.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qad5rg1l2tx41.png?width=348&format=png&auto=webp&s=9693cc2c75360e599f20ef95654b89e749bf0a0a\n\nTo compare PRPLW to a typical CBOE option contract, you divide the numbers by 200 (100 shares per option contract x 2 warrants per share).\n\nSo, to compare, the 15,525,000 publicly traded PRPLW are like having a call option with an $11.50 strike and 2/2023 expiration with open interest of 77,625 contracts, that traded 1,608 contracts yesterday and trades 618 contracts on a typical day.  Those are SPX volumes or intermediate strike TSLA volumes with an open interest that would show up on every unusual options activity report.\n\nAnyone complaining about volume on the warrants either:\n\n1. Hasn't bothered looking at any actual volume data, or\n2. Doesn't understand basic math.\n\nSomeone in the comments will complain about volume, I guarantee it.  I will give gold to the first person who calls out the first person to complain and refers them to this commentary.\n\n# Technical Astrology\n\nAs you can tell, I believe in Technical Analysis at about the same level as astrology.  I'm a capricorn, so how should I invest? =)\n\nI only bring this up because there has been quite a bit of chatter about a golden cross on the weekly chart where the 50 day moving average has moved above the 200 day on the weekly chart.\n\n[Golden Cross](https://preview.redd.it/axjrb7d91tx41.png?width=1161&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb859570defa7e7ef55fe368e86e70b18191bf5b)\n\nThe only and best response is to show that there was a Death Cross where the 50 day moved below the 200 day recently as well.\n\n[Death Cross](https://preview.redd.it/8h4j5al51tx41.png?width=1167&format=png&auto=webp&s=d90f874eb2c763a6daff3a67d0cee9a9fe2b36fa)\n\nThe appropriate conculsion is that this kind of crap is meaningless and only serves for confirmation bias.  So, pick your chart based upon your beliefs and hold to it.\n\n# Potential Outcomes from Earnings\n\n[Probabilities of Share Price](https://preview.redd.it/ynb7j8xaatx41.png?width=460&format=png&auto=webp&s=600d2676c31b3434a6fee278b13ce87489643aad)\n\nI see an array of probabilities for share price over the next few weeks following Monday's earnings release:\n\n**$19+ Share Price - 30% Probability**\n\nIf online sales have accelerated to the point where Purple is having manufacuring constraints again, the higher unit economics will drive this puppy above $19 per share as they will drastically beat pre-COVID guidance going forward and we will be looking at almost an entirely new business.\n\n**$15-$17 Share Price - 50% Probability**\n\nIf online sales have accelerated to the point where the better unit economics close some of the gap to pre-COVID guidance, but not yet to the point where it is causing manufacturing constraints, then this stock will trade in the $15-$17 range in my opinion.\n\n**$12-$14 Share Price - 15% Probability**\n\nIf CEO Joe Megibow's comment about online sales skyrocketing was really just a flash in the pan driven by a stimulus check, but we end up below guidance in the near term with very little support from online, then this will continue to trade in the $12-$14 range and wholesale sales will quickly make up the gaps when stores are open again.  If you don't understand this, [go back and read this post as to why](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g30vst/covid_recovery_play_prpl_to_1214_by_512_and_2024/).\n\n**<$12 Share Price - 5% Probability**\n\nPRPL would need to have some sort of serious supply chain issue or withdrawals of more than half the doors worth of their wholesale partners for this to reasonably trade below $12 going forward, ***especially*** in light of the current trend among Q1 earnings releases in this COVID world.\n\n# Positions\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f2t4e26eetx41.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=243139b0ee3c1b34f82c411e646303c34cd8b425\n\nI am long 528,413 PRPLW warrants and one lonely share of PRPL.\n\n# \n\n# tl;dr\n\nNothing to see here.   Move along.  You wouldn't trade this anyways because there is no options chain and you probably don't understand what a warrant is.", "created_utc": 1589062958.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ggp2vx/purple_prpl_earnings_is_monday_after_hours_heres/", "is_self": true}
