I bought in at $5.20 per contract x 10 and ended up selling for $9 per contract. While I said that I would only close out at 100% profit (5k), this stimulus bill kind of messed things up and I had to close out early. Total profit was $3,800, so I sent this dude his 10% ($380) this morning. -[https://imgur.com/gallery/LBGal9e](https://imgur.com/gallery/LBGal9e)\n\nAn additional 10% just went to the WWP (haven't received confirmation email but will post as soon as I get it). Side note, I'm 26 and a vet and can promise this is the best charity you can donate to. I know a bunch of dudes my age I deployed with that are fucked up and are not getting what they need. If you're going to donate to a charity, please put your money here.\n\nPositions bought: [https://imgur.com/gallery/Vw0Seol](https://imgur.com/gallery/Vw0Seol)\n\nAnd sold: [https://imgur.com/gallery/m1Xi91N](https://imgur.com/gallery/m1Xi91N)\n\nSo this brings us to the next week, same thing applies. Post in the comments your best/funniest DD and I will pick one play.\n\nRules:\n\n\\-EXPIRES no later than 4/3\n\n\\-5k Total YOLO\n\n\\-Winner will get 10% of total profit\n\n\\-WWP will get another 10%\n\n\\-I will not cash out until 100% profit\n\n\\-On a scale of 1-10, 8 being the highest, the autism of the play can be no greater than a 6\n\nI made some pretty good money the past couple of days so if it's a play I really like, I might do 10k.\n\nThere's a million ways to fuck this goat, I am just holding the legs.\n\nFuck Derek.", "created_utc": 1585094259.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fog6gz/community_voted_yolo_pt_2_winning_dd_gets/", "is_self": true}
