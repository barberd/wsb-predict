But I didn't sell to lock in profit. AMD proceeded to dip, and now the calls that I bought for about 100 each now cost 139 each. Correct me if I'm wrong, but had I sold for 2,600. I could have just re-upped, and bought more calls than I originally had.", "created_utc": 1582079559, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f63py4/i_thought_diamond_hands_was_a_good_thing/", "is_self": true}
