{"id": "gj5jo3", "title": "CSCO Calls", "selftext": "Why do I feel like I\u2019m the only one all in on CSCO?\n\nI work Directly in an IT field. We are primarily an Fortigate shop, I just watched what happened to FTNT and Palo Alto Where they cater to SMB Space and mainly Hardware Players (With subscriptions.)\n\nI have a feeling CSCO that caters to Large Enterprise and Municipalities \\ Gov (in my area at least), Will leverage WebEx harder and more importantly Upgrade equipment. Equipment in place is likely to be Supported for Current workload + ~30% overhead. and more likely setup for High Availability (Meaning similar modeled Gear but redundant.) Not Higher loads.\n\nMy hopes are Enterprise needed a Step up ASAP in Front end devices, and maybe not so much switches. But hopefully a massive increase in Edge devices and Subscription services that went with them. Large Price tags but neccesities \n\nI can't be the only Idiot Holding through earnings can i? My only DD on this is our Vendors are flat out of any CISCO Firewalls. I dint add and more proof, casue well this is discussion not DD and i'm not giving away my next plays just yet on Vendors selling all this gear.  But go call your IT Dept. Ask if you can buy any Cisco Gear right now\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/bDuEpsi", "created_utc": 1589397216.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gj5jo3/csco_calls/", "is_self": true}
