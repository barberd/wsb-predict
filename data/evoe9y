{"id": "evoe9y", "title": "PTON Updated Short Interest and Earnings Estimates Jan 29th", "selftext": "Stock is likely down despite positive upgrades because JPM analyst wrote that there is some confusion with the lock-up expiration date and that the REAL lock-up ends Feb 24th, NOT March 24th. They didn't clarify why that was the case in the note. I went back through the S1 and it seems that provided they release earnings by a certain date and get deal banker approval, they can release some holders to sell shares after 120 days (instead of the normal 180 day lockup). So maybe that's why lock-up expiration is Feb 24th (after they report earnings). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nS3 has a short interest of 86% this morning\n\nIB has 70,000 shares to short for 38%\n\nFidelity has 0 shares at 29.5%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEarnings come out Feb 5th.
