All you have to do is memorize a 4 letter ticker for one of the biggest companies in the United States. Yet I see 80% of people here WHO OWN OPTIONS OR STOCK ON APPLE CALL THE TICKER APPL. It\u2019s A A P L not APPL. I know that APPL is basically the name of the company without the E but how could you constantly get the two confused over and over again. That\u2019s like calling Nvidia NVID or Exxon EXX. At least know what the ticker is if you own securities on the underlying company. Please I beg you all to preserve my own sanity.", "created_utc": 1562019838, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c812l5/its_aapl_not_fucking_appl/", "is_self": true}
