How do we know? \n\n1 - Wayfair already announced they're gonna have a killer quarter. If you don't know that already then GTFO and catch up on yesterday's news\n\n2 - Overstock and Wayfair are interchangeable competitors. I've used them both. Both are just drop shipping markets for other brands, similar price range. Don't trust me? Just look at their websites. Same shit, same prices\n\n3 - google trends. Look at trends for [buy furniture](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=buy%20furniture) or [buy couch](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=buy%20couch). Also look at [overstock](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%203-m&geo=US&q=overstock). Its going up. People are shopping there.  \n\n4 - extrapolating my own internal experience. As soon as I was forced into WFH quarantine I looked around and realized all of my furniture was shit. Stupid couch, ugly bookcase, and didn't even have a desk. I'm not alone here. People are stuck inside and need to spend money to feel better because they're addicted to consumerism. They can't spend on clothes, eating out, cars, and drugs, so they'll buy video games and furniture. \n\nNow normally I only do otm because I'm a degenerate gambler. But volume is low on this stock so I had to keep it boring. OSTK 5c 5/8\n\nAnd yes, I know its already up 30% today. I'm sorry I should have told you assholes yesterday but I'm lazy\n\ntl;dr Rich assholes stuck at home are upgrading their furniture.
