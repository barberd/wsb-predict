{"id": "cqgxnq", "title": "Overhyping Yield Curve Inversion", "selftext": "Has anyone else noticed that major news networks and even financial news have said little to nothing about the yield curve inverting the last several times it did so? Correct me if I\u2019m  wrong, but didn\u2019t the yield curve invert for a record length of time last quarter? Why does the media choose THIS TIME to blow it up way out of proportion?? Anyone who follows the bond market could see that it was teetering. The only people who are surprised and hit the panic button today are the same people buying TSLA calls @ $420 because they are infatuated with Elon M\u00f6\u00f6sk. \n\nThis leads me to believe that we will be in the green tomorrow and Friday because those who wanted to buy low and sell high decided that this time around was the time to scare the living shit out of middle America and cry wolf over the inverted yield curve. When Vox is posting articles screaming recession due to inverted yield curve you know that the boys upstairs REALLY wanted to drive the point home. \n\nIn conclusion: buy low. Sell high. SPY calls 8/15 expire @ $284.50 yoloooooo", "created_utc": 1565821389, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cqgxnq/overhyping_yield_curve_inversion/", "is_self": true}
