[They're up 80% \\(+$20\\)](https://imgur.com/NoaORN2) the past 3 months because all they gyms closed but Becky still needed to get in her spin class. Their earnings report came out great and the stock surged.\n\n**Anecdotal Evidence**\n\nI ask of you, how many people do you know that dropped +$1,000 on a new Peloton bike? I don't know a single person. I do, however, know at least 6 people who have bought smaller home gym items the past couple months. Things like dumbbells, elastic bands, etc. I know a few Becky's that recently got big into boxing. And Becky *loves* Dicks, they sell nice fitness clothes there too.\n\nToday during lunch I decided to make a little trip to my local Dicks and see what the status was. I was surprised to see as many people there today as you would see pre-pandemic. They've implemented covid-friendly measures to help put customers at ease, such as personal shopper programs, curbside pickup, and their spacious stores makes it easy to [social distance](https://imgur.com/zVQI9xz) yourself. \n\nI noticed quite a few empty shelves walking through the store; things like [bicycles](https://imgur.com/felomcl), random gym equipment, [dumbbells](https://imgur.com/iRMNqMY), kayaks, [disc golf discs](https://imgur.com/jQzYEaz), and [coolers](https://imgur.com/57DqyOA) were all sold out. If you visit their website you will find quite a few items marked \"limited stock\". You think Chad is going to risk losing his gainz because his Planet Fitness shutdown? \n\n**Sports Segment**\n\nThis is where the most uncertainty lies: team sports. It's no secret that a lot of little kid league and intramural sports have been canceled, and everyone knows little league and Dick's goes hand in hand. But I am curious how much that will actually effect their business. You know middle aged Jeff at work? That's right, the delusional parent that brags to you about how his little kid is going to be the next big NFL quarterback. I would be surprised if Jeff doesn't buy his kid training equipment so he doesn't \"lose his edge\" during the pandemic. Plus his kid has been annoying him and Karen to death while he's working from home. \n\nPlus it looks like a few leagues are already planning on going forward:\n\n[Youth sports leagues work with municipalities to allow teams to play this summer](https://www.wbay.com/content/news/Youth-sports-leagues-work-with-municipalities-to-allow-teams-to-play--570648401.html)\n\n[Even with some changes, metro kids ready to begin summer sports leagues](https://fox4kc.com/news/even-with-some-changes-metro-kids-ready-to-begin-summer-sports-leagues/)\n\n[IHSAA, IGHSAU approve opening summer sports seasons](https://www.telegraphherald.com/coronavirus/article_0ea14724-a2d7-5ebd-8b6b-d6352900902a.html)\n\n[Texas pushes for kids to return to normal during pandemic](https://www.brownsvilleherald.com/2020/05/21/texas-pushes-kids-return-normal-pandemic/)\n\n**Analyst Estimates**\n\n\n>\"Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods (DKS) is a market leading retailer of sporting goods. Through its 850 stores, Dick\u2019s provides consumers with an extensive selection of sporting equipment, apparel, and footwear. Although we understand the challenges Dick\u2019s and other retailers are facing, we are encouraged by the company\u2019s abundant liquidity ($69 million in cash and $1.36 billion credit facility availability) and underleveraged balance sheet (0.35x Debt to EBITDA).
