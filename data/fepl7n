When you call to change/cancel a flight for the \ud83c\udf7b virus, they will not hear you, thus leaving you with your ~~dick~~ ticket on your hands forced to make that flight. Free money, can't go tits up!\n\n\"Unreal! After holding for 2hrs to try and cancel a flight because @sxsw was canceled fue to #coronavirus, @AmericanAir agent picked up, said she couldn\u2019t hear and hung up. Called back and it told me to wait 2 more hrs. I still have to fly @AmericanAir on Tues. confidence = LOW!\"\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ShaneSkelton/status/1236092162397229056?s=19", "created_utc": 1583552712.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fepl7n/aal_to_the_moon/", "is_self": true}
