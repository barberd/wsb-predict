The beat was a result of higher-than-expected sales volumes, partially offset by slightly lower-than-expected realized prices. OGI sold 4,987 kg eq at an average net realized price of $5.40 per gram in the quarter vs. our estimate of 4,250 kg eq at a net price of $5.66 per gram. See Figure 2 for more detail.\n\nAdjusted gross margin came in at 60%, in-line with our estimate and consensus as a result of lower-than-expected COGS per gram offsetting lower-than-expected prices. COGS per gram came in at $1.99, below our estimate of $2.20 per gram.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA of $13.3 MM was a 47% beat on our estimate of $9 MM as a result of higher-than-expected revenue combined with lower-than-expected spend on G&amp;A and Sales &amp; Marketing. This marks OGI's third consecutive quarter with positive adjusted EBITDA.\n\nThe Company finished the quarter with $63.4 MM in cash and nearly 17,000 kg eq in inventory.\n\nImpact: Positive. OGI continues to execute on its domestic market strategy and posts industry leading gross margins despite its indoor cultivation facility (see Figure 3 for more detail).\n\nPotential $140 MM Debt Facility to Fund Growth\n\nOGI disclosed that it expects to receive debt financing of approximately $140 MM, subject to the completion of definitive documentation. The Company expects the majority of these funds to finance its expansion plans. The Company's Phase 4 expansion, which will bring annual capacity up to 113,000 kg per year, has $98 MM remaining in capex.\n\nThe Company expects to complete construction of its Phase 5 expansion by October 2019, which is expected to comprise an area of 56,000 sq ft built under EU GMP standards. The production area will be dedicated to edibles, extraction and processing. The facility is expected to cost $48 MM to complete and will help to position the Company for the extracts and export market.\n\nOGI also disclosed that they are actively seeking a partnership to develop cannabis-infused beverages in anticipation of legalization of extract products this fall. We believe the Phase 5 expansion and a potential beverage partnership to be key catalysts for the Company, helping to transfer its position as a leader in the dry flower market to the extracts market.\n\nTarget Price Methodology\n\nOur target price is based on a 50/50 weighting of 6x 2020E sales of $241 MM and 18x 2021E EBITDA of $106 MM. OGI currently trades at 5.2x 2020E sales vs. Intermediate peers at 3.4x and 11.9x 2021E EBITDA vs. Intermediate peers at 7.9x.", "created_utc": 1555464650, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/be1zn4/organigram_tsxv_ogiotcqx_ogrmf_on_the_cusp_of_big/", "is_self": true}
