US shale producers face falling cash balances, bankruptcy (and theyre already overleveraged) due to low prices putting the bonds at risks of defaults etc, causing downgrades. \n\nBut that's not all. With falling stock prices from coronavirus and economic worries, corporate debt is also at risk of being downgraded as companies committed a bunch of debt to share buybacks for the past decade. Rating agencies see declining value of assets that pertain to the bonds. It is a high probability they downgrade the rest of the 4 trillion in BBB corp bonds. \n\nSo what happens? 4 trillion dollars in BBB get pushed into the high yield market, adding to the 1 trillion already there. Interest rates spike on junk bonds, and pension funds puke as BBB bonds are no longer investment grade - only what pensions funds can buy (or higher).\n\nPension funds go bust because they cant find yield in higher grade bonds (thank the Fed). IPO companies like Uber and BYND and more go bust as they cant service their debt, potentially in the wake of a global recession. Rating downgrades shock credit markets. \n\nPanic selling, capitulation of overhead supply, and loss of confidence. \n\nTLDR buy longer dated index etf puts, vix calls", "created_utc": 1583866227.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fgit6k/credit_markets_and_the_crash_of_crude_oil_a_piece/", "is_self": true}
