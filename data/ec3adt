Ive been trading it for a while now, and recently got the hang of making a decent amount of money in it.  I posted a while back about going from 1500 or so to 12.5k and reinvested 2500 to go at it again.  I put all 2500 into some calls for early janaury and assuming this thing bounces off the current floor, ima let it ride and then buy some 160s for mid January.  If my plan takes hold, easy gains.  \n\nWhy do I think it will do this?  \n\n1.  Its a momo darling.  Enough shorted to get some filthy short covering runs, but tons of people pumping this so it tends to have crazy runs, especially after big pullbacks.  \n\n2.  It just had a big pullback from their CFO leaving, which, was mostly priced in from him selling all of his shares about a month ago.  No news yet on why he left, but I assume its just a normal poaching.  He left on good terms it seems seeing it was a several month long process and no backlash or outspoken anything happend.  \n\n3.  They are in a great place to hire a solid CFO and get a run from this.  ROKUs financiald have been doing extremely well.  Relatively low debt, insane growth, and the stock price reflects this.  Im sure they have more than enough money to hire an amazing CFO that is looking to capitalize on their amazing run and further it.  \n\n4.  It just bounced off a strong floor and ran up several % only to get hit with the dumb money sell off once the cfo news announced, but it held strong.  In other words, held strong through the bad news, could easily rip once new cfo plans are announced, probably will happen soon.  \n\n5.  Everyones been bragging about their holiday sales the whole time.  They have been selling insane amounts, but the CFO news took the hit.  Usually once it bounces of floors like this, a wave of upgrades will come in.  My guess is sometime soon a wave of upgrades is gonna come in, itll rally, theyll release good news about holiday sales, and kill it on the ER and itll rally to new monthly highs, and close to ATH then find a new floor.  As is the trend.  \n\nGodspeed fellow autists.  I see this rallying tommorrow after holding strong today.  I think it will open in the green, and do a nice run up, and upgrades will fuel the further run.  \n\n(It currently has a 200$ pt from one firm as well)", "created_utc": 1576622288, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ec3adt/i_think_roku_is_gonna_start_to_hit_new_monthly/", "is_self": true}
