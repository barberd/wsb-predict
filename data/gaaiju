{"id": "gaaiju", "title": "$NAT DD/ 23 Tanker with $70,000 per day", "selftext": "Fellow Autists & Degernates  \n\n\nI have no idea how extensively $NAT has been reported on here, but hear me out. Nordic American Tankers CEO Herbj\u00f8rn Hansson said on CNBC that they charge $70,000 for a day storing oil. He also said they have operational costs of $8,000 so that boils down to an average of $60,000 profits per tanker. Given that they have 23 Tankers in their fleet as of right now, that's roughly $1,380,000 per day. If they would ONLY have this price for 50 days in the quarter, that would yield $69,000,000 profits. (This is assuming that made ZERO money the other 40 days). Given Shares outstanding of 142,571,000 that would yield an EPS of $0.49. ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blqp2f0YBj8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blqp2f0YBj8)) \n\nHIGH Earning Estimates expect an EPS for the quarter is .35 and consensus EPS forecast is .25. Given all that, they report earnings on May 12 and should comfortably outperform the consensus. Given that tankers can charge up to $200,000 a day, and assuming they have this price for at least 50 days and making ZERO money the remaining days of the quarter, the projections are still conservative. What do you guys think? I'm long $NAT with a Credit Spread.  \n\n\nThis is obviously a short-term play but seems like a comfortable position.", "created_utc": 1588170648.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gaaiju/nat_dd_23_tanker_with_70000_per_day/", "is_self": true}
