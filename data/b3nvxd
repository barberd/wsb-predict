Anyone else believe BABA maybe way overvalued and then some?", "selftext": "**Just want to see if there is anyone else here that may have some of the same feeling regarding BABA...**\n\n**Some say now could be an okay time to buy and that we could still see another %50 in growth from current price of about $181.00 , some say it's a safe bet with not a whole lot of risk.**\n\n **I think that it could be time to go a little short..**\n\nI have done a whole lot of research which is not in the post, and what you see here is just you could say a personal opinion. My outcome is based in observations from varying financial reports and from collection of many different legal and fiscal data points relating to Alibaba from over the last 4-5 years.\n\nSo this is a stock I have watched closely since the IPO, I feel like there was in a way some connections with Alibaba and with the Chinese reverse merger bust which had until 2011 or so;  increased a lot of investor attention to the massive growth in the Chinese economy. Especially attracting western investors looking to get in on the China growth early.\n\nSo if we look at the timeline we can deduct that Alibaba had their IPO just 4 years at the most following the big  uncovering of the vast number of reverse merger frauds involving countless Chinese companies. We can assume that Alibaba's founder was undoubtedly surrounded by these sham Chinese companies that were milking western investors for trillions. I am not saying Jack Ma necessarily partook in any of these fraudulent reverse mergers directly , however in the years leading up to Alibaba's launch it would be impossible for a new, growing company to ignore everything that was going on around within their economic space.\n\nIs it really that far-fetched to believe that while the founders of BABA were busy laying the ground work and foundations for their business, while existing in a business ecosystem where questionable and downright fraudulent practices were commonplace and in many cases culturally 'baked in' ; that none of these numerous 'grey-area' financial trickery or outright fraudulent practices made its way in some shape or form into the roots of Alibaba? \n\nCould it be possible that elements from its conception act as a very realistic smokescreen or vail of secrecy which can very well be to the benefit of a company with so much gained and so much to lose even today?  But could these 'hidden hands' actions equate to very much the opposite for investors today? Will we see somewhat of a re-enactment from almost ten years following the brunt of all the China shenanigans?\n\nI think so , the question is just to how much of an extent will it be exactly? Could be small , could be much bigger....Could be bullshit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "created_utc": 1553155604, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b3nvxd/doubts_lurking_in_the_shadows_of_alibaba_anyone/", "is_self": true}
