{"id": "ds7y4m", "title": "The future of FUN - or why you should buy calls on Cedar Fair.", "selftext": "You've probably been to a Cedar Fair park before - Kings Island, Cedar Point, Carowinds, maybe even Knotts Berry Farm. The company is currently beating the pants off of their two main competitors: Seaworld and Six Flags. They recently bought two schlitterbahn parks and are planning massive expansion with California's Great America, buying all of the land the park resides on. The previous quarter, the park beat the shit out of earnings, and Haunt season just ended, which will give amazing revenue numbers, jumping Earnings Per Share. I'm expecting the stock to go to $60 and jump even higher, as the company gradually takes over territory from Six Flags. Let's be real people, six flags is going down the shitter and people notice. Their main way of making money is by taking over parks and expanding, rather than sprucing up their existing parks. Cedar Fair parks are cleaner, have higher quality rides, and are set in better areas. The areas that Six Flags does share with a Cedar Fair park are fiercly contested or are outright dominated by the CF park. Who goes to Six Flags America when Kings Dominion is 45 minutes away? Who goes to Magic Mountain when Knott's Berry Farm is right there in LA? Who would go to La Ronde when Canada's Wonderland exists?\n\nLong $FUN, and expect a big earnings call tomorrow.", "created_utc": 1572998500, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ds7y4m/the_future_of_fun_or_why_you_should_buy_calls_on/", "is_self": true}
