I tried to let everyone enjoy the fun, but I had enough.\n\nI bought 30 190 2/14 Calls. I was in this position for less than 30 seconds before MSFT dropped to the fiery tendieless depths at which it currently resides. I\u2019m down and have not been able to achieve a full erection since. \n\nI reached out to Microsoft directly - https://imgur.com/gallery/2uMYu6i I\u2019m hoping for all of our sakes they can resolve this issue. \n\nIf MSFT touches 190 before close on Thursday, I\u2019ll send the first 3 people to comment $100 dollars. \n\nMay the tendies forever be in your favor. \n\nWhat are our thoughts on ROKU?", "created_utc": 1581468303, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f2idft/i_crashed_msft/", "is_self": true}
