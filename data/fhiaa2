{"id": "fhiaa2", "title": "Intro to Repo", "selftext": " Since most autists on this sub thinks repos are just JPow pumping the markets up with funny money I decided to make a post to explain it.\n\nRepurchase agreements aka repos are agreements that the Fed enters with banks to make sure that there is enough in reserves/liquidity for banks to continue to loan money to businesses or customers. These loans are paid back the next day or within a period of time shorter than 2 weeks in most cases. When done once in a very long while these are no big deal as the bank keeps money flowing and the Fed makes money off the interest from the short term loan.\n\n[https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/repo-reverse-repo-agreements](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/repo-reverse-repo-agreements)\n\nSince September 2019 we have engaged in the only large scale, long lasting repo effort since 2008/2009. The link below shows the rate of repurchase agreements in that time. This indicates that banks do not have enough liquidity to do day to day lending and we are moving towards a liquidity crisis unseen since the last recession.\n\n[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WORAL#0](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WORAL#0)\n\nDo we avoid this? Maybe with smart policy, luck on the CV front and an OPEC+ agreement. If those things don't happen we may see the Fed lower rates to 0, engage in full on QE and start to assume toxic assets to brunt a possible collapse. - All speculation but it's my guess if CV hits hard and OPEC+ dig in on this production surge.\n\nTL;DR: Repos are not JPow sending the markets to the moon with newly minted cash, they're to prevent our banking system and the businesses that rely on it from collapsing.\n\nEditing one of my comments from the WAYMT Thread:\n\nSince interest rates are so low and the markets were doing so well, CFOs wouldn't be doing their fiduciary requirements if they didn't take loans to maximize their share holder value and do stock buy backs, sending the price higher. This has created a bubble of basically free money and increasing value. The interest rate on this debt is so low that if the market was outperforming that interest rate, the companies can make more money off of leveraging that debt. This has led to the highest levels of corporate debt ever.\n\n[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BCNSDODNS](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BCNSDODNS)\n\nIf we collapse too hard without thorough government intervention, companies will start to default on their interest payments and the largest corporate credit bubble in history may burst. I don't think Trump and the Fed will let that happen but we're being hit with the 1-2 combination of a demand/supply chain issue from CV and cheap oil kneecapping energy.", "created_utc": 1584027760.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhiaa2/intro_to_repo/", "is_self": true}
