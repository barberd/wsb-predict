{"id": "g98iyv", "title": "Ever wonder who buys shares in bankrupt companies?", "selftext": "Yeah, me neither until my puts on WLL didn't print.\n\nSo, in typical WSB fashion let's do some digging after we've already entered the trade. Who the actual fuck is buying this when they declared bankruptcy almost a month ago, and released their restructuring plan a couple days ago that includes wiping out the current shareholder's completely?\n\nGotta be dumbass retail investors right? Nope, they hold 1.03% of the shares and even the bagholders on Robinhood were selling today according to Robintrack. Mutual Funds hold 69.29% of the shares and other institutional investors hold 34.88%.\n\nSweet, smart money is holding the shares and they're clearly going to dump if the restructuring plan will wipe them out... um, turns out not so much. The 'smart' money guys are buying right now.\n\nFor example;\n\nFidelity Low Priced Stock Fund bought 206k shares\n\nHwabao Upstream Oil and Gas bought 1.6m shares\n\nDFA US small cap value bought 828k shares\n\nSSga Funds bought 4.9m shares\n\nBlackrock bought 310k shares and is the largest individual shareholder at 14.41% of total outstanding shares, because of course they are. Fuckers own everything.\n\nMillennium Management LLC bought 3.9m shares\n\nThe list goes on. I'm not betting that retail investors will be smart enough to read the restructuring settlement and sell these shares. It turns out that I'm betting against mutual funds that don't give a fuck because it's not their money. Awesome.\n\nSomehow shorting a bankrupt company that's about to bend their shareholders over and fuck them bloody is a bad idea.
