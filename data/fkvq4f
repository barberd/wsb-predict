{"id": "fkvq4f", "title": "Why TSLA is screwed:", "selftext": "You can trace the last TSLA rally to the announcement of the Cybertruck. All doubt was cast aside and investors just piled on it like ants on spilled caramel.\n\nBut you know those $100 deposits to reserve a Cybertruck? They are looking increasingly silly for people that just lost 30-40% of their portfolio. They are not going to spend 80k on a car in a year. Not a chance in hell TSLA is selling those 240k or whatever it was units that were reserved.\n\nThat and Elon thinks COVID-19 is \"dumb\". He cannot afford to stop now.\n\nTSLA is going to the shitter. Might not go bankrupt but will be a disaster.", "created_utc": 1584560522.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkvq4f/why_tsla_is_screwed/", "is_self": true}
