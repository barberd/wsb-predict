{"id": "epnsmp", "title": "Go all in on TSLA now, opportunity of a life time.", "selftext": "1. Macros are extremely bullish due to expectation that low interest rates are here to stay (before we expect interesting rate to go back up at some point, but now, there is no chance of that). Bubble will form. TSLA is the FOTM stock, it will pop tremendously on a good earnings report.\n2. Delivery number are very good at 112k. Delivery exceeded maximum production capacity as production is only at 105k (also a record, production is improving but gradually), so much so that I expect that there is a backlog going into Q1. An obvious piece of evidence for this is that Tesla has not reduced prices even though it has raised prices by $500 on Q4 2019. Last year Tesla drop prices substantially immediately in the first week of January.\n3. If point 2 is true, then Elon will probably revise his expectation for Q1/Q2 2020 to be fairly profitable. If this happens the shorts will be FUBAR as the short thesis will completely crumble as Q1/Q2 2020 unprofitability is critical to the short thesis.\n4. If point 2 is true, S&amp;P inclusion will happen shortly after Q1 2020. Adding fuel to the expectation of an epic rise.\n5. Model Y is expected to be released soon (my expectation is that it will release early Q2 2020), I remember the run up prior to release of Model 3. Taken all this together, the next few months has the potential for an absolutely epic run for TSLA.\n\nAll in TSLA.
