I DO KNOW ONE THING, BASEBALL. So I was thing if the Astros can cheat there way to winning the 2017 World Series and keep the gains(winning the championship). I think we can find a cheat that will give use a advantage and keep our gains(large amounts of tendies)? Now I'm stupid as fuck so this is as far as my brain made it on this idea. So my idea does kind of have parameters: 1)It needs to get us lots of tendies in this calender year. 2) It needs to benefit the whole organization ( The sub u/wallstreetbets ). 3) I need tendies so I am in on the cheat! You can go to prison but my virgin asshole has to stay that way! So you are going to have to price in me not going to prison! So someone with a mind past a highschool diploma (me). I was wondering if you have any cheat ideas that might help out this wholesome sub? Or just me with my $150 portfolio on RH?", "created_utc": 1579583826, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/erpzdk/can_we_find_a_cheat_code_like_the_houston_astros/", "is_self": true}
