The economy is still shit, people are still dying, and granted there may be some marginal money to be made on the ride up, when this busts it\u2019s going to suck if you\u2019re holding a call.  Who\u2019s says we can\u2019t slide back?  If I were a \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b I\u2019d be expecting tendies in the 1-2 week timeframe on this bubble.  Alas I am not anymore, instead I\u2019m waiting for the ride up after the pop.\n\n\nThat being said my recommendations are the following.\n\n800c 5/15 AND 630c 5/15. 70$ straddle both ways.  1000% guarantee to lose or make money. 50/50.
