{"id": "hbt5b6", "title": "[Chart] Voodoo & [Options] Chains - $NVDA and $SQ", "selftext": "I want to get this off my chest before I begin. Two posts in two days is a big no-no. A deadly sin. It should never be attempted and I don't recommend it... BUT that never stops me. Prayers up that this DD doesn't flop and go south. If you've never read my posts, welcome to the club. I'm a pretty technical guy and my DD reflects that, but I understand fundamentals and I will speak to those from time to time. If you don't know what I mean by voodoo and chains you probably don't know much about options. Stick around and find out more, nerd. Also, if you missed last night's DD on $HD and $SPOT it's right here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hb80hc/chart\\_voodoo\\_options\\_chains\\_hd\\_and\\_spot/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hb80hc/chart_voodoo_options_chains_hd_and_spot/)\n\nI put the offer out there today to do some DD on any ticker for whatever lucky autist replied to my comment. I got a few requests, but $NVDA and $SQ caught my attention for several reasons. Let's dive into these over-hyped, millennial stocks and discuss why both could definitely moonshot in the near term.\n\nFirst come, first serve. The first retard requested FB and NVDA. Everyone's second favorite chip maker gets the spotlight: **$NVDA**\n\n[6 month chart](https://preview.redd.it/a6sn6qrubs551.png?width=759&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f79f2b6863f12bdfd3aac10335ea54f2f203417)\n\n[3 month chart](https://preview.redd.it/lorxrwtwbs551.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4ef07337cb1196cfa8890b9b19f0da61c65bc1c)\n\nI would like to share a quick story with you: $NVDA was my first love in the stock market. Back before I knew how to trade options I picked a few shares up and flipped them for disgusting returns. This was during the 2017 run so I'm sure you can imagine the endless green candles. Today, $NVDA was trading near $370. ATHs is exactly $380.00.\n\nIf I have learned one thing from $NVDA it is not to doubt it during ER. That being said, just because the monster stock beats earnings doesn't mean the price will follow. Recent EPS has fallen between $.60 and $1.80. I have no reason to believe the chip sector will outperform this market given the macro risks, but I've said this before and been dead wrong. ER falls on 8/13 so watch out for this.\n\n$NVDA faces a competitive market among $INTC, $MU, $AMD, and others... The stock boasts a $227B market cap that could easily go to $275B in a delusional bull market. Financials are solid and healthy and the FCFs are increasing faster than you can sell a 10 bagger after a big red candle.\n\nTake a look at the graph since March and you'll see that $NVDA already traded a bullish flag pattern and confirmed the trend mid-May when it shot up to the $360 price level. $NVDA is trading in a tight and flat trading channel with high volume that is starting to taper off.\n\nRSI is signaling that the stock is nearing overbought, but this is $NVDA, so this stock could keep pumping. MACD is slightly bearish but it's a weak signal. Let's watch the price action tomorrow and see what happens - momentum doesn't lie.\n\nThe options chain is pricing in a $30 move on both sides after ER with high volume and open interest on this expiry.\n\nLet's get to the plays... debit spread on the short term and OTM calls on the intermediate term:\n\nFor 7/17 I like the 385c/400c debit spread. To enter this, you go long on the 385c and you short the 400c. This will result in a net debit on your account allowing for a relatively cheap entry and a wide window for tendies.\n\nIf you want to play earnings, try the 8/21 420c. 400 of these contracts sold right before the market closed today so someone is expecting a big gap up. I like the exorbitant strike price. I like the recent momentum. I'm going to watch for continuation and play accordingly.\n\nSecond on the list is Jack Dorsey's very own: **$SQ**\n\n[YTD chart](https://preview.redd.it/0cs9eth9cs551.png?width=763&format=png&auto=webp&s=5039f65807f21b9d868512b39b956a126bb10aca)\n\n[3 month chart](https://preview.redd.it/450gpv9ecs551.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c7778c7f68533a4eb63fbed87ad32b52a268bb7)\n\nThere isn't much I can say about $SQ that I didn't already say about $SPOT last night. The autistic fellow that requested this DD made a great point. This $SQ play is essentially the same play as the $SPOT play but we're looking at $100 price levels rather than $200 price levels. What we have here is a speculative company that is nearing profitability and ready to burst above resistance levels.\n\nThat's the tightest trading channel I have seen so far since March. $SQ has a goal and it knows how to get there. My advice? Don't buy puts. $SQ climbed over 100% steadily - I mean really steadily - since March and is starting to show an ascending triangle pattern off the short term support level at $75.\n\nRSI is screaming overbought, but honestly with volume this supportive I think it can hover at these levels.\n\nThe options chain is pricing in a $4 move on both sides for the 7/2 expiry.\n\nOther than ER on 8/5, we're missing a big event that will move this stock up. $SPOT had it's podcast deals and other news. I said I was going to play this like $SPOT, though, so let's get to the play: barely OTM 1-2 week calls.\n\nI'm going to pick up the 105c for either 6/26 or 7/2. How to play this? Monitor the stock for continued momentum - if the stock breaks out above $100, buy the 105c. If the stock price leaps tomorrow for some reason I'm going to watch the 6/26 and 7/2 110c and 115c. I probably won't be playing earnings on this one.\n\nTL;DR\n\n$NVDA deep OTM calls - 8/21 420c\n\n$SQ weekly calls - 6/26 105c", "created_utc": 1592537014.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hbt5b6/chart_voodoo_options_chains_nvda_and_sq/", "is_self": true}
