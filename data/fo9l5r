And, uh, we're gonna be opening, uh, relatively soon and we are, our time comes up, uhr, Monday or Tuesday, our, ya know the allotted two weeks, but we'll stay a little bit longer than that, but we wanna get opened very soon, I think that's a big reason it's gone up. I also think that fact that The Senate and The House, I, uh-wur, we seem to be getting along as much as you can get along, we seem to be getting along now on a, on a bill. I think that maybe had even less of an impact than the fact that we're opening up this incredible country, because we have to do that. I'd love to have it open by Easter, okay, I'd love to have it open by Easter, I will, I will tell you that right now. I would love that have that, it's such an important day for other reasons, but I'll make an important day for this too. I'd love to have the country opening up, just raring to go, by Easter.\"*", "created_utc": 1585072476.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fo9l5r/trump_town_hall_announcement/", "is_self": true}
