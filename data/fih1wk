{"id": "fih1wk", "title": "How far the SPY could fall? Comparing to Italy, South Korea, Japan", "selftext": "TLDR SPY 220p late May (at least).\n\nI've noticed something interesting - the South Korean, Italian and Japanese indexes have fallen to about the same level as 2016 lows as COVID-19 cases have risen and countermeasures are deployed. I was then left wondering if the infection rate (either percent of population or total numbers) is correlated in any way. So I went and [pulled the data together to have a look](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h_UqDH1cSFt-plDka9tvzKtf0zxDawoQQ69_qZpuu5A/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nSo that data is: World Health Org [data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data) of the infected in each country from Feb 1 to March 13. It's also the indexes (SPY, FTSE.MIB, KOSPI, Nikkei 225) and their percent daily cumulative change. Although I've put the data together, I'm no good at doing the number crunching to demonstrate my thesis: That as the number of infected climb there comes a point where the indexes fall to 2016-ish levels. Let's look at examples. \n\n**Italy**\n\n* Their market is currently at [the same lows as 2016](https://www.tradingview.com/x/B94UZn98/).\n* People think Italy is [10 to 12 days ahead of the US](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/coronavirus-has-italy-lockdown-what-rest-us-have-look-forward-n1155396).\n* Italy's index is down 40% from Feb 1 (see my chart).\n* Italy has at least 15,000 cases, 0.02% of population\n\n**South Korea**\n\n* Their market is currently at the [lows of 2012-2013](https://www.tradingview.com/x/0eNiXnYn/). \n* South Korea's market has fallen 17% from its Feb 1 place. But their market has been a bit rubbish since its ATH in 2018.\n* South Korea's cases have leveled off at 7,800 and 0.015%.\n\n**Japan**\n\n* The market is at the [highs of 2016](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZHI3OHdf/). \n* The Nikkei 225 has fallen 26% since Feb 1. \n* Japan has 700 cases (but is already taking a lot of countermeasures).\n\n**The USA**\n\n* The SPY is at [2018 levels](https://www.tradingview.com/x/JNz68aVZ/).\n* The market is down about 20% since Feb 1. \n* Cases - we can't even figure out that accurately.\n* A 35% drop from Feb 1 would be SPY to 220. A 53% drop would be SPY to 180.\n\nSo here's the thought experiment. If the US is ten-twelve days behind Italy, how was the Italian market 10-12 days ago? So 10-12 days ago the Italian market was at -7%, and it was at [2019 resistances](https://www.tradingview.com/x/TsFG1qsO/). Where's the US now? At around [2019 lows](https://www.tradingview.com/x/PgT8p4US/) - I think one could argue that that the US now is already reacting to global news, especially news out of Italy, whereas obviously Italy 10 days ago didn't know what was coming, hence the drop is \"ahead\" of schedule.\n\n**But in the end, if the US trend matches the trends in Italy (in particular), then the SPY could drop to 2016 levels, meaning a range between the low of 180 (worst case scenario) and 220 (matching trend?).**\n\nThere's **lots** of ways this analysis could be wrong. I'm really, really hoping people better with data will have a look and chime in. PLEASE READ THE COMMENTS FOR CLEVER PEOPLE BETTER AT THIS THAN ME. Everyone, feel free to go and copy out the data in my sheet and mess with it yourself.
