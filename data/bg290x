Totally just kind of a fuck fest of a week, so let's talk about it a bit.\n\n# My Project Update\n\nIf you want to stay up to date on the things I'm working on outside of here, follow me on my Reddit profile or feel free to message me.\n\n# How I Pick Plays For Myself\n\nThese plays are found using my own scanner criteria across a variety of metrics depending on market conditions. Picks are generated from that scan. Those scans are ran through scripts that check certain volatility skews. These are my own scripts, and I won't divulge much more than that about it. The indicative theory here is sell IV when it's high and buy IV when it's low, follow trends and follow the big money (I rarely list my credit spread plays, because I don't want someone to blow their retirement out of the water based on my advice). Volatility is literally the most important aspect in options pricing and finding positive EV situations. A few of the criteria for the ToS scans are:\n\n* Market cap of $5B+\n* Daily volume of 1M+\n* Volume, volume differential, RSI, 52 week low's and high's, ToS sizzle, and a few others decide what comes out of the scan, then selected as a pick based on script results/current market conditions/sentiment.\n\n# Results On Last Week's Picks\n\n**Bank of America (BAC) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Beat on EPS, lowered guidance, stock acted hesitant and got pinned at 30. If you weren't in FD's, you're probably still just fine here. A few guys sent me messages saying they finally turned green on Thursday on this play. Entries/exits matter.\n\n**Atlassian  (TEAM) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Ah this one disappointed me a lot. So they posted a deferred revenue drawdown to slowly decrease over Q3/Q4 and mentioned since they had raised prices people came in too fast last quarter, etc. That being said, they beat EPS, again, like I thought -- but lost. I would say it's definitely a good spot to get long shares and buy the dip, once it shows stabilization. I think 100 is historically a pretty important support level, but I don't remember and don't have any charts up.\n\n**Netflix (NFLX) -** ***BEARISH*** \\- So, what happened is somewhat bearish I guess, because Netflix didn't blow its load and just shoot to 400. That being said, I sold a bit of premium on this, and had some short dated calendar spreads to the upside in case they moved but no dice on half of that. I think they kind of sandbagged though, and I don't know if it'll just stay range bound but it's one of the reasons I don't trade Netflix or Tesla, almost ever. I don't like them much as trade opportunities, and I prefer just to buy some shares and understand I'm stuck with them.\n\n**Tilray (EA) -** ***BEARISH*** \\- Yo. They printed for me. And I think cannabis puts will, for the most part, print for you too for the next week or so, and then after earnings. I don't know how they're going to try to color their earnings report but holy shit, I think this is finally the quarter when people say, \"Ok, you have to make money now or sell SOMETHING\" because Tilray's given up like 20% in a few weeks now. The Canopy/Acreage deal is interesting, but what will it REALLY do?\n\n# Let's Talk About When To Buy Or Sell Vega\n\nI'm not going to talk too much about this. I'm making some more expanded content on it.\n\nBest tip I can give you: When IV is relatively low, be more willing to buy and take a long position, versus when IV is relatively high, be more likely to take a short position.\n\nBuy IV when it's low, sell it when it's high. That doesn't necessarily mean to sell any options you have if the IV goes up, but it can.\n\nAnyway, let's move on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Picks for Week of April 15th, 2019 [EARNINGS TIME]\n\n**All of the commentary on specific tickers are simply notes I wrote to myself. Each ticker listed is not a suggestion to buy or sell, but simply the ones I took notes on that I'm considering entering. These notes are not to you personally. These are not complete transcriptions -- simply summaries of my thoughts. Do your own DD.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Microsoft (MSFT) - $128.37 -** ***BULLISH*** \\- **They report on Wednesday after hours.** On the tail end of an upgrade but also coming into what historically, has been their strongest quarter for higher earnings surprises/moves around earnings (Q3), I'm bullish on Microsoft. From my estimates, there's a good chance that we see a record quarter for their subscription revenues, and I think a lot of things are just flat out going right. Azure is growing hand over fist, and Office 365 sub base is growing steadily, and I think the company's management is just making good decisions and doing a great job overall. LinkedIn is growing, I haven't done research on how much, but I really like the entire model the company has moved to over the last decade and it seems they can sustain and grow it, also. I expect people to profit take, so pick your poison and entry here before earnings. I don't doubt this stock could be at or above $140 by the end of June, though.\n\n* **Expected Move: $3.60** \\- Like I said above, when they've had their biggest earnings moves and surprises, it's been in Q3 historically. Not to say I think they're going to pop 10% or anything, because 99% sure they won't, but $5-$5.50 isn't out of the question.\n* **52 Week High: $123.52 -** They're making new highs, I wouldn't be taking the downside on them. Is a pullback possible? Sure, but it doesn't mean it's going to stick.\n* **Plays I'm Looking At -** I'm looking at long dated calls, strictly\n* Disclaimer: I am long options for this stock right now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Verizon (VZ) - $58.04 -** ***BULLISH*** \\- **They report on Tuesday before market open.** Verizon has some headwinds in the 5g market coming, not sure if they can offset their capex spending though. I think I read that it's well over $10 billion for the rest of the year. That being said, I think this is a proxy to Apple and other carriers in the idea that they do payment plans on devices and obviously make some kind of profit on those devices, and we found out sales weren't AS BAD at Apple as we thought there were, which would mean sales weren't AS BAD as we thought they were for mobile carriers.\n\n45% of their revenue is postpaid mobile. Obviously. Their growth in subscribers though is undeniable and there's always more kids with cell phones (I'm not using this as a REASON, just an example of a perpetually growing market). I'm bullish.\n\n* **Expected Move: $1.39** \\- I think market makers are underpricing these options, it's the main reason I'm playing it. My modeling shows a $2.25-$2.30 move, which means you're getting a bargain on IV and other things. Who knows by the time Monday I get this posted, though.\n* **52 Week High: $61.58 -** They're close to new highs and I want to be in there if they can break through it and rally above.\n* **Plays I'm Looking At -** Once again, long expiration calls, with some debit spreads that are a bit shorter.\n* Disclaimer: I am long options for this stock right now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**UnitedHealth (UNH) - $222 -** ***BULLISH*** \\- You can do your own research here but I think this stock is wildly undervaluing this company's assets and potential revenue. I think this stock really has room to run back up, and I have a personal price target of $292 on it. I think it can go even higher, though.\n\n* **52 Week High: $287.94 -** They're SO FAR off their 52w highs and I think that there's just been undue downward pressure and pain on the healthcare industry. I don't BTFD often, but if this isn't a prime place to do it, I don't know what is.\n* **Plays I'm Looking At -** Calls with time to play out. Some short term ones near the money, but planning on trading them day to day and just riding the ride up as well as the long game.\n* Disclaimer: I am long options for this stock right now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Tesla (TSLA) - $273 -** ***BEARISH*** **-**  **They report Wednesday after market.** After disappointing delivery numbers, I don't know how Tesla is going to save this quarter with earnings. I don't really think anybody's betting on them to rocket upwards, at all. Elon is a liability, as much as I love the fuckin guy, but there comes a time when you have to say, \"okay, we were ahead of ourselves with buying this shit at $300+\" They just need something as a catalyst, I don't know what their 2 PM announcement will have in the way of autonomous but anything they gain from today's announcement, I expect it to promptly give back with earnings.\n\n* **Expected Move: $19.09 - This could be even bigger by end of day.** It's just going up as I'm watching it right now, but anything they gain in their event will push this number slightly higher, but it could double this in a really shitty ER and normal world.\n* **Plays I'm Looking At -** I think this is a prime position to sell premium on calls to the upside. Even if it goes up after earnings, my plan would be to hold them and hope not to be assigned, and buy enough expiration to deal with it in case it does go up. It's always just a matter of time before they go back to $230 because of a car blowing up or somebody saying something stupid.\n* Disclaimer: I plan on being short Vega in these.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I got 3-4 more but I'm still hungover from Easter, and I need to rest. I'll add them mid day.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# State of the Market\n\nWe're going to get to those all time highs sooner or later. I hope it's sooner because a lot of plays I have are kind of betting on the short term being to the upside above those highs. I think that there's piles of opportunities right now, and I think we're going to see volatility greatly increase this week and next as May approaches. There's little question that the sideways action represents some type of wide-spreading accumulation and consolidation, so the question is will the people accumulating for the next move upwards on the S&amp;P be stronger than those taking profit? If so, we make all time highs and continue cruising. If not? See you in a few weeks 2,700.\n\n# About Correlated/Corresponding Picks\n\nCorrelated picks are important. An example is playing Apple/Facebook/Microsoft and SPY. If any of those gain, it's more likely SPY gains that week since it's weighted towards them, and the S&amp;P is weighted towards them. Calls in both double dips, but can see your money evaporate also. Buying tech sector puts and SPY calls makes no sense, for the exact same rationale unless it's a pure hedge against share value, or an isolated catalyst like a lawsuit or acquisition, in which case, it's probably going to pull the ETF/index down or up with it anyway. The best way to double dip is to find complimentary positions. Example: Verizon on top of Apple is good - if their streaming service is good and requires iPhone hardware, the market may see a boost in iPhone sales from Verizon and ATT, etc. Corresponding plays.\n\n# Will You Cover This Ticker/Give Me Your Thoughts On This?\n\nEdit: Not doing this much this week probably.\n\nIf you've got something you are eyeing, I'll occasionally be willing to offer my thoughts on the company and the underlying. **I can not, and will not tell you when to enter/exit/buy/sell any stock or option,** however. I will simply say what I think about the specific ticker and their outlook. Once again, it is simply **my opinion and not advice.** **If you ask for a ticker overview, include the ticker symbol with a $, like $AAPL,** so I can just search the thread for them. I probably won't go over them all and likely already have my thoughts on many, but I'll try to reply with thoughts on many. The threads will get longer week by week, so try to understand if I don't get to all of them. Below is a list of stocks I won't cover, and it will grow week by week. If you ask me specifically for advice on your own position, or situation, I'll simply ignore your comment. This warning is all over the post.\n\n**BEFORE YOU ASK FOR A TICKER:** Lots of people ask for the same thing, I don't mind adding color commentary on specifics if you have a question about a certain aspect of the company, but please just load all the comments and CTRL+F (CMD+F for Mac) and look for that ticker to see if there's a conversation going on about it already.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Private Messages/Chat Requests:**  Hit me up if you have questions. I may or may not respond. Depends if the question is stupid or not.", "created_utc": 1555940565, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bg290x/i_pick_options_so_you_dont_have_to_easter_edition/", "is_self": true}
