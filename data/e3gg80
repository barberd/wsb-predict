{"id": "e3gg80", "title": "AMZN love", "selftext": "Bezos is my king. He could give me anything and I would love it. I love how prime video is so great and that I can buy so many different videos on demand. I also like that I buy a hundred pack of condoms for 100 dollars. The thing is I wish he personally deliver my packages, why doesn't he bring them to me and thank me for my patronage of his fine e-commerce site. He should be thanking me for all the money I have spent on blow-up dolls and fleshlights. That is some good money and he should be thanking me.\n\nI get twitch prime but I'm not going to use it because I am afraid Bezos won't show up to give me my G-Fuel this week. I wish he would print a full page about me in the Washington Post, which he owns by the way. I want to be the feature and be shown to the world as Amazon's biggest consumer. I want him to mail me a love letter about how much money I spend on him. I hope AMZN hits 2500 one day and I hope I am sitting on Bezos's lap when that happens, I'm sure it will be a happy time.\n\nI really really am excited to for him and I heard he has been around town lately I hope I can run into him one day and say, \"I'm your biggest fan, do you want to go to this fancy French place I know\" and he'll say sure I would love to go to a fancy French place with my biggest fan. I would squeal with delight and get wine drunk before the main course and Bezos would take care of me and then I would lay in his lap as he drives off to the airport to leave. He would say thanks for teaching me a little bit about your city and would leave me exhausted at the airport, hunger and content. I would immediately call Dad to come pick me up and then be excited to tell him about how I met Jeff, you're boss and how cool he is and that I a great night with him.", "created_utc": 1575042848, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e3gg80/amzn_love/", "is_self": true}
