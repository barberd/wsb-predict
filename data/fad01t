These guys have super potential and are seriously undervalued right now because their  CEO ordered a Twitter attack on some Nascar reporter for some reason. This was on 2/24. \n\nSome more details:\n\nPenn National acquired Barstool Sports on 1/29 with 36% interest in the company. This resulted in a spike in stocks at the time, and a steady rise until this Twitter bullshit. Penn is the country\u2019s largest regional gambling provider, and their acquisition of Barstool definitely gives them an added edge amongst their competitors. \n\nLong-term, with increasing traction around legalizing and regulating sports betting and with a recent pass of these bills in 2019 across several states, this is an industry that should definitely be building up over time. If you\u2019re a spineless nobody then you could even buy the stock now and make decent tendies over time. But we don\u2019t have time for that. \n\nPoint is, are people gonna care about some Twitter drama within a week or two? I fuckin doubt it. A golden opportunity awaits!\n\nTLDR 3/20 30c 31c", "created_utc": 1582814339, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fad01t/penn_calls/", "is_self": true}
