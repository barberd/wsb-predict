Before I got into gambling I enjoyed myself a nice alcoholic beverage or two. Fast forward a few years and I am attending AA on a near daily basis.\n\nWanna know what you can't do during a national lockdown? Go to AA meetings. You cant go to NA meetings, you cant do shit. As you can imagine AA meetings online are absolute shit.\n\nWell what the fuck does this have to do with options trading? Good question. \n\nFirst off, the relapse rate of addicts is huge, even during normal circumstances. Take away meetings, and that number skyrockets. Now add in all the soccer moms drinking themselves to death on a daily basis to stomach being guaranteed with their shitty kids for a few months while schools are closed. \n\nRehab rates are going to explode when this is all over. Anxiety is at all time highs even for normal people.\n\nNow consider someone like me, completely sober and just raw dogging reality with no chemical escape. Makes a drink seem nice, but we all know where that leads.\n\nBasically what I'm saying is addiction treatment stocks are gonna go up. Or maybe down. Eventually. \n\n# $AMPH - Amphastar Pharmaceuticals Inc., producers of Narcan.\n\nWe had an opioid crisis before we all got locked at home.

Inc.\n\nMultinational behavioral healthcare provider. It operates a network of over 584 facilities. They specialize in substance abuse disorder.

(PFE) is a good one though. More tickers here -**[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/drug-addiction-treatment-stocks-watch-205254813.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/drug-addiction-treatment-stocks-watch-205254813.html)\n\nTLDR; No AA means more rehab. Addiction rates are already huge, and a national lockdown is going to make everything worse. Lots of companies make money from treating addicts.
