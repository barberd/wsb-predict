{"id": "g363l5", "title": "$GILD was a pump and dump", "selftext": "The reporter put out this piece https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/16/early-peek-at-data-on-gilead-coronavirus-drug-suggests-patients-are-responding-to-treatment/ which spiked the price of $GILD up 16% at one point while ES_F rose 80 points. When the reporter put out this incomplete study at close, $GILD had no liquidity, and the complete study would have been released in 7 days. The reporter got this information from a video in which a doctor at Uchicago was speaking to other faculty about the success of the trials, so the reporter got this information indirectly. Gild had to put out official statement later that day saying it is anecdotal and that we need to wait for the final statistical result. Big blocks of $80 strike calls traded last week and YESTERDAY on top of this. So how trust worthy is this reporter? Adam Fuerstein, has been previously accused of some \"stuff\", I don't see it ever was proven but you can judge for yourself out of the Washington Post back in 2014, the letter to SEC is no longer available on the web. https://t.co/2oAoVKh0OS?amp=1 Imagine your the Biotech Hedge Fund guy who bought up GILD shares and/or call options and then have one of your buddies put out on an article (on a medical website to get more legitimacy) or to tweet it out to a large following, especially during time of sensitivity. 34k Open Interest, 7.5k traded YESTERDAY - the thing expires TODAY, no one buys this many the day before unless they know something. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/0HEg1mH", "created_utc": 1587143387.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g363l5/gild_was_a_pump_and_dump/", "is_self": true}
