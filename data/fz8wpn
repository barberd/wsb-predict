It\u2019s a sword, but instead of having its handle at the end, it\u2019s handle is in the middle. If you\u2019re too autistic to understand just think of Darth Mall\u2019s lightsaber but a sword version. Okay so you take the sword and you aim one end at the person your trying to kill, and then you charge them. You\u2019re probably going to get stabbed by your end as well, but hey they might die first so it\u2019s all good. Now at this point your probably wondering what this shit has to do with stonks...\n\nWell it\u2019s all an \u201canalogy\u201d (if you don\u2019t know wtf that means type it in GOOGLE) here\u2019s how it works. I think we can all agree the market doesn\u2019t make any sense. News is like \u201cmost unemployed in 50 years\u201d but also says \u201cbest stock increase in 50 years\u201d. Okay so here\u2019s how the strategy works: pick a stonk, any stock. Buy calls for it AND buy puts for it. Now think about it, you CANT lose. One of them HAS TO GO UP. Now if you make tendies then repeat... if not then cry in your misery then repeat.\n\nPS 50/50 odds are a lot better than what most of you retards get anyways ;) Enjoy!", "created_utc": 1586622773.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fz8wpn/volatility_trading_101/", "is_self": true}
