WTF is Mirror?  [It is the yoga and aerobics version](https://www.mirror.co/) of what PTON is to bicycles.  \n\nIn my opinion, this was a brilliant move by LULU.  They already in the pants of all those yogis and now they can cross promote Mirror at a time when we're all scared to go outside or to our yoga studio and are instead buying $3000 Peleton bikes.\n\nPTON is up over 300% this year.  What will the acquisition of Mirror do for LULU?  I don't know, but I love that a powerful apparel company just became a tech company that benefits from the pandemic or the end of the pandemic.\n\nLULU 7/31 320C", "created_utc": 1593544135.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hitxfm/lulus_acquisition_of_mirror_makes_it_a_pton/", "is_self": true}
