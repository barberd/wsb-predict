Its insanity that its wonderful Q1 earnings caused nothing to happen. It seems like the stock price is entirely tied to the current \"by the minute\" oil prices. \n\nOil is gonna crash again in a week. Buy stocks for the dividends or buy options right now, literally 10 cents for june 15$ calls. Jesus christ could you imagine being 10$ itm on 10 cent call contracts. Put in $1000 and get back 100k.\n\n\nEdit: I've been shilling tankers a lot because none of this makes any fucking sense and the illogicalness makes me angry. 40% dividends!!!", "created_utc": 1589298599.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gids0d/eurn_150_below_fair_market_value_40_dividends_wtf/", "is_self": true}
