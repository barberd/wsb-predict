{"id": "gjr473", "title": "Theta gang roundtable: Selling covered calls on tankers", "selftext": "**TL;DR:** Buy tanker stock. Sell a call to the dimwitted call buyers. Collect dividend(s). Buy to close after the call value tanks when ex-dividend price drops. Is this EZ gainz or BIG RETARD?\n\nConsider EURN. They're trading at $9.64 right now. In two weeks, they'll pay a $1.16 dividend.\n\nNow you can sell a call on them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Strike, August call|Last price|\n|:-|:-|\n|5.00|4.80, extrinsic = 0.16|\n|7.50|2.55, extrinsic = 0.41|\n|10.00|0.90|\n|12.50|0.50|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe simple way to do this would be to sell the OTM call at 12.50. Then you pick up the dividend and the premium of an option that will likely expire worthless. And if it doesn't expire worthless you get a 25% gain on the stock for a 30-40% total gain depending on if the price shoots up before or after the dividend.\n\nThe trickier strategy is to sell the ITM calls. By put-call parity, you're selling a synthetic put on the underlying to insure the purchaser. Selling the ITM calls let's you collect the intrinsic value of the call which would let you get 25-50% leverage on the dividends plus win due to an immediate drop in the intrinsic value of the option following the ex-dividend date. Assuming your counterparty is not retarded, the risk here is that either they exercise before the dividend or that you can't fill the order with enough extrinsic value to discourage early exercise.\n\nBoth strategies share the risk that the underlying price plummets and you take a loss on the stock, but I think that's unlikely when tankers are already trading so far below their NAV.\n\nThis strategy seems like an easy way to get 5%+ gains in a month while holding a stock with a lot of upside potential. Not much, but honest and safe profits.\n\nLet me know what you think.", "created_utc": 1589478179.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gjr473/theta_gang_roundtable_selling_covered_calls_on/", "is_self": true}
