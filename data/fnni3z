They\u2019re most likely going to be bailed out too. The government will never let the major airlines fall- our society needs them to function. Do your own DD but I believe there\u2019s a lot of money to be made. Last week there was a 40% gain in one day.\n\nEdit: I am not claiming to know where the bottom is. I am only making mention of this because it\u2019s a very volatile sector and they have the potential to seriously rebound.
