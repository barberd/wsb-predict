They were priced at ~ .30.\nI slept through my alarm, woke to missing out on 1000% gains.\nQuestion is should I have placed the order with a limit price waaaay above .30 to give TD a chance to fill at open? Can I assume that even if I put the limit at $3.00, the order would fill at the lowest price available right at open?", "created_utc": 1580490523, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ewrgk7/opening_order_pricing_after_hours/", "is_self": true}
