Part 2 - 20% gains in one day so far", "selftext": "NOTE: THIS STOCK IS NOT AVAILABLE ON ROBINHOOD \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's been 2 days since I made this post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cp4e97/fuck\\_cgc\\_long\\_medmen/?sort=new](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cp4e97/fuck_cgc_long_medmen/?sort=new) \n\nMedMen is currently **up over 20% from yesterday. And we're just getting started.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why are we up 20% in 1 day? Will these tendies keep cooking?** \n\nThis morning, MedMen announced pro forma sales of  [$61M USD](https://www.newcannabisventures.com/medmen-sees-q4-revenue-at-42-million/)  \\- up 15% since last quarter.\n\nWith more US cannabis companies' earnings being released tomorrow (CWEB premarket, ACRG aftermarket), I believe we will see strong bullish continuation tomorrow as investors shift their focus from the Canadian sector to the US, where the % gain on investment will be exponentially larger.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Retail Locations** \n\nMedMen's current earnings period was based on only **37 retail stores, providing $61M USD in pro forma sales.**\n\nPending acquisition closures, MedMen will be licensed for **92 retail locations** across 12 states. \n\nMedMen currently has only 1 store open in Florida, but are on track to open 11 additional stores by the end of 2019. They are licensed to open up to 35 retail locations and have over 20 leases already secured at prime locations within the state.  \n\nFlorida is an extremely important state in the US Cannabis Sector. Currently, cannabis is only legal for medical purposes, but  [it is the nation's fastest-growing medical marijuana market](https://www.miaminewtimes.com/marijuana/florida-is-americas-fastest-growing-medical-marijuana-market-11161345), with over 10,000+ people signing up per month. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Cash Burn &amp; Cash Position**\n\nWhile the top-line growth is impressive, there was never a doubt MedMen would be able to sell product. Cash burn was always a legitimate concern though. With the difficulty raising capital in this industry (no access to banking, or non-dilutive financing), high cash burn means frequent share dilution. \n\nThe company announced today that they are on track for an approximate **30% overall reduction** in corporate SG&amp;A from the Dec. 2018 quarter. It's my belief that big money is closely monitoring this metric and will use this sign of positive corporate governance as initiative to begin buying larger positions of the stock. \n\nMedMen now has access to up to $280M USD over the next year or so from the Gotham Green Partners' investment mentioned in my previous post. They are perhaps in the healthiest cash position of any US cannabis company now and are set for aggressive expansion into more states as they legalize.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Political Factors (don't argue politics in the comments please, you savage fucks)**\n\nI don't want to make this post political, so I will focus on **what we know so far.** \n\nThere two likely scenarios in the November 2020 election:\n\n1. **Trump Wins.**  [Republican Senator, Cory Gardner has confirmed on multiple occasions that Trump will support individual states' rights on cannabis reform.](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/dec/19/cory-gardner-donald-trump-supports-marijuana-refor/)  More states will slowly come online as they see states like Colorado, California, and Illinois reaping the tax rewards of adult-use laws.\n2. **A Democrat Wins.**  [All of the top democratic candidates support legalization at the federal level, except for Joe Biden.](https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/2020-presidential-candidates-marijuana-positions) That said, Joe Biden's plan notes that he will not stand in the way of individual states legalizing, and he is on board for federal decriminalization and federal legalization for medical usage.\n\nWhatever ends up happening will not negatively affect MedMen. If it is up to individual states to make the decision, then we will likely see a protected and restricted market in which MedMen will continue to play the game of monopoly between the other few players.\n\nIf federal legalization happens, it likely won't be until at least March 2021, after a new president potentially takes office. By then, MedMen will have massive market share and will be ready to serve the massive influx of new users.\n\nChairman of Privateer Holdings, and CEO of Tilray  [said today](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/13/tilray-earnings-q2-2019.html);  *regardless of who wins the US presidential election next year, he expects the US to legalize marijuana... \"I think the tide has really turned and it doesn't really matter who's president in terms of cannabis legalization...It's really one of the few issues that has bipartisan support in Washington, DC.\"*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Economic Hedge**\n\nMany blue chip stocks are at, or near all time highs. The trade war and interest rate factors have some people panicking over a potential recession or market crash. It's my belief that the cannabis industry would be fairly resistant to such events. It is also my belief that considering the infancy of the industry, there is far more room for growth in the cannabis industry than most blue chip stocks at these current levels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**MedMen is still significantly undervalued.**\n\nDue to pressure from shorts, and FUD attacks in the media, the stock is bogged and is still trading at a significantly lower quarterly price to sales ratio than its peers.\n\n**Acreage Holdings** (Canopy Growth's US investee) announced pro-forma quarterly revenue of **$36.6M USD today**. Their fully diluted market cap is **\\~$1.42 Billion USD.**\n\n**MedMen** announced preliminary pro-forma quarterly revenue of **$61.3M USD today.** Their fully diluted market cap is **\\~$1.52 Billion USD.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**US Sector is getting spicy.**\n\nBefore market open tomorrow, Charlotte's Web will be announcing earnings. Their low float stock is poised to run on a potential beat. If they beat considerably, they are capable of pulling the entire US cannabis sector for a ride as more money is pulled out of the Canadian sector and dumped into the US space.\n\nAfter market close tomorrow, Trulieve will be announcing earnings. They are expected to have  [\\~$53M in revenue.](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TCNNF/analysis/) Their fully diluted market cap is \\~$1.08 Billion USD. What is notable however, is that they are only operating in Florida. Their cost to expand into other states is likely to come at the costs of current shareholders as dilution will be necessary. They are a very dominant player in Florida, however with MedMen and other companies now entering the state, it is expected their growth will slow down, as they are already at their maximum capacity for number of stores allowed in the state.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading. Hopefully some of you appreciate the DD. **I am long MedMen with all my tendies in the oven and we only just finished pre-heating.**", "created_utc": 1565752581, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cq3xxw/fuck_cgc_long_medmen_part_2_20_gains_in_one_day/", "is_self": true}
