They seem to have thousands of users already so I assume some of you are members and can fill me in.\n\nFrom what I understand, this platform allows you to make daily predictions on 5 pre-selected stocks. If your predictions are accurate you get a cash reward at the end of the day. If your guess is incorrect, there's no penalty...\n\nThere's no fee to sign up and no monthly membership fee.
