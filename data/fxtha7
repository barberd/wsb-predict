{"id": "fxtha7", "title": "#HEAR TURTLE BEACH", "selftext": "Hello my fellow autist,\n\nAs we are all getting our anus penetrated by buying puts, I was searching for different ways to make money. I thought of things I was doing everyday and could only think of 2 things: Masturbating & playing call of duty. I looked into activision stock but that shit is hella expensive and then I looked at what the fuck I needed to be gaming and that would be a headset. So I looked into headset companies and saw turtle beach. It has a pretty small market cap of 85m right now but last time when fortnite came out the stock went up into the 20-30 area. Right now it\u2019s trading at $6. I could see an increase in demand because everyone is gaming at home and needs a headset because otherwise you are very autistic and lonely. If you look at the google trends for gaming headset and turtle beach you can see another surge these last 3 months. You can see a nice pattern of spikes every Christmas because some 12 year old autist was going to tell his dad about his moms boyfriend if she didn\u2019t give him his headset. Analysts are thinking of a shit year for HEAR but as most of the autists in here I think I\u2019m smarter than those fuckers. If my theorie is right this thing is going to the fucking moon if it doesn\u2019t well then I lose a shit ton of monayyy. Now do whatever you want with this bullshit I really don\u2019t care. \n\nTLDR: just buy calls a few months out", "created_utc": 1586442850.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxtha7/hear_turtle_beach/", "is_self": true}
