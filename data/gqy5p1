{"id": "gqy5p1", "title": "TSLA DD", "selftext": "Alright so TSLA is a story stock. Here's the developing stories right now:\n\n1. China-US Cold War: doesn't affect it. No longer exporting to China. Even if they do, only parts and some batteries. China is heavily invested in TSLA, no rug pull for the foreseeable future. Zero impact\n2. Demand: strong. However, Q2 is shot. I'm expecting 70k-72k deliveries worldwide. Remember TSLA barely eeked out a profit last Q on 88k deliveries? Subtract maybe $150M of gross profit from the lower sales. Then add expenses for the opening and closing of factories. Then add some expenses for the PPE and donation all around for good wills. Then subtract $150M for loss of ZEV/FCAU pool credits due to TSLA did not start making EU cars until 5/18. The only way TSLA can be profitable this Q is for it to realize all $140M accrued ZEV credit and a crazy amount of FSD revenue. I don't see it happening.\n3. Battery day: priced in. V2G, cheaper battery, faster to produce. All cool. Take a while to show up on the financials, though. The point is TSLA is too big for this kind of reveal to build hype. The rumor is powerful with longs and gamblers piling in for months. Now that it's pushed to end of June, possibly July, those people are disappointed. What's there to wait for in the mean time? Elon is a show man. Don't expect any sooner on virtual. Has to be face to face. Not to mention large capex in the mean time to build up battery making lines. Tesla will post huge gains given a year for this battery tech to materialize. For now, lurking mode.\n\nTSLA has not underperformed the NASDAQ for no good reason. The fact is you have a tech company being slowed down by COVID in its transition to a bona fide techy. For now, it's primarily a manufacturer. It trades too frothy for a manufacturer. TSLA bulls however are some of the most resilient that's why it doesn't sell off. It's not displaying irrational exuberance either like it did in February. Consider this: back in February, there was no growth in the market. TSLA had growth. So it was a good gamble. Now, its growth has slowed down. Ecommerce, pot, vaccines, airlines, oil, etc... ironically became \\*growth\\* relatively to the March low. So, nobody is gambling on TSLA anymore. Don't apply the same mindset \"900/1000 here we go\". As stupid as the market is, it needs catalysts. TSLA has no catalysts for the next 3 - 6 months. IV went from 100%+ to 70%. And for good reasons. It's not going anywhere. It's just a boring, cash rich, cool product automaker. And that doesn't capture investors' imagination in these shitty times.  \nMMs were bleeding out of their asses for 4 months from 10/2019 to 2/2020 on calls. Now, they take revenge. Don't fight MMs, not when you're alone. Look at the volume.  \n\n\nPosition: weekly short 800p if cash gang, short 850c if bull gang.Short term play: 6/19 900c next Friday. China's May sales coming out early June provides some boost. Will not be enough to turn a profit so sell it quickly.", "created_utc": 1590503656.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gqy5p1/tsla_dd/", "is_self": true}
