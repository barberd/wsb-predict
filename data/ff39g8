I never got very high above 25k because I didn't have any semblance of the discipline to day trade or to trade that often.  I'd trade just for the sake of it and it would destroy me.\n\nI think my All Time chart is a pretty common one for those times... had my first big options win on MU, then lost it all on MU shortly after following Marty into the abyss, then became a permabear ZH reader for all of 2019 after the Dec 2018 drop.  The bottom was -86%.  When you've lost that much every missed opportunity torments you.  You just can't help but think about the time you liquidated 12k of AMD at $9 cost basis to gamble that money with options, or the time you sold your SBUX calls minutes before ER to responsibly take some risk off the table, only to miss out on a 30k gain the next day.  The constant dull shame of your portfolio is a daily thought.  You start wondering whether you have a gambling problem (you do).  You go to actual Vegas and can't really have fun at 5 dollar black jack table because you've lost 10 times that instantly on a shitty RH fill.\n\nYou have to turn this acquired risk appetite into a system that works for you rather than against you.My success started when I started doing debit spreads instead of just long calls/puts and when I learned to just chase whatever currently has existing momentum instead of trying to time breakdowns or breakouts.  And when I do want to do something retarded, make sure that it's both really cheap and will pay out at least 4 to 1 if it works.\n\nPositions and big wins for the last spike:\n\n13k on AAPL calls on my wedding day (which is when the spike started)\n\n30k on TSLA puts on 2/5\n\n15k on TSLA calls on 2/19\n\n30k day trading puts on the week of destruction at end of Feb\n\nTL;DR Get married and your graph starts going up somehow", "created_utc": 1583622324.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ff39g8/my_mod_application/", "is_self": true}
