{"id": "fem7gy", "title": "Buy solar where the sun is still shining upon the market: SolarEdge (SEDG) DD", "selftext": "In the face of significant market headwinds - I humbly submit for your consideration a bull case for SolarEdge (SEDG).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the last year, SEDG has continuously beaten market earnings expectations in spite of the now year and a half old [25% tariffs](https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/472691-analysis-trump-solar-tariffs-cost-62k-us-jobs) that were placed on photovoltaics against China - which has significantly diverted production to other areas of the world and at the time was seen as a potential pitfall for investment in solar.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecond, the company is for all reasonable purposes operating without any significant debt (D/E of 5.68) - which gives them a ton of wiggle room if we do enter a recession as a result of eurodollar/covid 19 problems. Additionally, it will insulate them from shock related to failing zombie companies who are leveraged to the tits.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThird, the stock is uncoupled from the broader market (-.25 Beta) and is still trading near ATH - implying that smart money is still pouring in despite broader market fears.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFourth, in the last year SEDG has significantly expanded its foreign operations - [signing new deals](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/solaredge-supply-enfindus-inverters-1gw-080000014.html) with European solar installers like Enfindus. As a result of this and its 33% earnings surprise in December its 2020 EPS expectations have been revised up 11 times in the last 30 days.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFifth, I believe that SEDG is in a stronger overall position than its primary market rivals [ENPH](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ENPH/analysis?p=ENPH) and [RUN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RUN/key-statistics?p=RUN) in large part due to its larger market share and lower total debt than either, giving it more potential leverage for growth than either moving forward. (Actuallly, interestingly, a very strong bear case can be made for RUN as a result of its negative EPS and total debt being greater than its entire market capitalization).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that SEDG represents both a long term growth opportunity and a good short term hedge against market volatility. It will continue to perform better than its major peers for the foreseeable future - and I believe that the future demand for renewable energy will only continue to increase. For this reason, I believe that bulls looking for a play to ride out this market will find SEDG to be a really good addition to your portfolios.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have no strong convictions regarding call plays in the face of short term market headwinds - but I would strongly support LEAPS or actual investment into the company. In short, make tendies where the sun shines.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: SEDG good company, SEDG make many tendies, you buy SEDG for tendies", "created_utc": 1583536804.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fem7gy/buy_solar_where_the_sun_is_still_shining_upon_the/", "is_self": true}
