They are gonna kill it with all this WFH \n\nAMZN - e-commerce is like the only thing still alive and booming.  AWS is absolutely fucking killing it (just like MSFT).  Amazon Prime video exploding from people staying home.  Yea you bet your ass they gonna kill it.  Guess who is the backend for ZOOM by the way... it\u2019s fucking AWS\n\nAAPL and GOOGL gonna be a wash prob. They will suffer but I\u2019m sure their services might help them break even. \n\nNow we had some crazy panic sell that took Microsoft to 130, amzn back to 1600s etc etc. but now that the panic is gone and Msft basically telling the whole fucking world \u201cwe rich fuckers\u201d what you think will happen??\n\nThe biggest dicks on the block just took a viagra.  It\u2019s gonna take a shit load to take SPY and QQQ to new lows IMO and even then, 2/4 of the big dicks need to go limp to get to 180\n\nPositions\nAMZN 3000c 1/2021\nMSFT 190c 1/2021", "created_utc": 1585628993.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fs6e6e/msft_aapl_amzn_googl_carried_spy_and_qqq_last/", "is_self": true}
