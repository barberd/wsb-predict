(PVTL), a leading cloud-native platform provider, confirms that, through a Special Committee of its Board of Directors, it is in discussions with VMware, Inc. (VMW) regarding a potential business combination, and we are proceeding to negotiate definitive agreements with regards to a transaction in which VMware would acquire all of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock of Pivotal for cash at a per share price equal to $15.00. **However, a definitive agreement between Pivotal and VMware has not been executed. There can be no assurances that a definitive agreement will be executed between the parties**. The foregoing information is being provided solely to acknowledge the public announcement on Schedule 13D/A filed by Dell Technologies Inc. (DELL), Pivotal\u2019s and VMware\u2019s controlling stockholder. Pivotal does not intend to provide any further information as to developments, if any, in its discussions with VMware regarding a business combination unless and until a definitive agreement is executed. \n\n\n$PVTL closed today at 13.95 or some shit. Went up around 7$ on the day this was announced. \n\n\nWhat\u2019s gonna happen if the deal flops?  Honestly the chances might be low but you know how autism works, and the fact that it\u2019s almost trading at the purchase price of 15$, as opposed to an inflated price of 10, this means big puts if the deal goes flip flop!\n\n\nDon\u2019t have a position yet - just thought about this at 12:20am.", "created_utc": 1565929426, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cr19mm/puts_of_a_lifetime_if_pvtl_deal_flops/", "is_self": true}
