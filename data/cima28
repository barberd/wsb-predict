{"id": "cima28", "title": "What exposure do current tech giants like Google and Amazon have to a possible bubble in the private VC funded markets?", "selftext": "So after reading that [Softbank wants to open a new fund with $108b to invest and a plan to raise a new massive fund every two or three years](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-26/softbank-forms-108-billion-vision-fund-2-with-apple-microsoft) ,  I'm wondering what the possible ramification are from the current Silicon Valley/VC bubble in the private market on public companies. \n\nIn the dot-com bubble the stocks and earnings of tech related companies like Cisco, Microsoft, Intel,.. non dot-com companies where hugly affected by the mania. Other then Cisco those Companies had an elevated P/E ratio but nothing as crazy as the dot-coms and was based on huge revenue and earnings growth largly by dot-coms buying hardware/software from those companies.\n\n[March 2000:](https://seekingalpha.com/article/2986486-15-years-after-bubble-burst-tech-stocks-competitively-priced)\n\n|| CSCO| MSFT | INTC | ORCL | IBM |\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|P/E| 221.7| 65.9 | 27.4 | 21.4 | 28.4 |\n|Market Cap|$591.4B|$620.0B|$341.4B|$135.0B|$229.7B|\n\nSo at the time it was pretty reasonable to be long those companies because of the real income they generated, if you didn't account from where the money was really coming from.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSimilar example now with money burning Electric Scooter sharing companies:\n\n* [Lime valuation $2.4b with $765m in total funding](https://growjo.com/company/Lime)\n* [Bird valuation of $2b with $415m in total funding](https://growjo.com/company/Bird)\n* [Uber, Lyft and Ford going in too](https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/23/the-electric-scooter-wars-of-2018/)\n\nThe capital spend mostly trickles down the supply chain to [Ninebot who bought Segway for $75m in 2015 and sold 1M Scooters in 2018](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/30/tech/segway-history/index.html) . Plus Bird [said](https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/16/18141418/scooter-vandalism-rugged-bird-lime-spin-acton) its electric scooters tend to last one to two months before they need to be replaced. Lime\u2019s scooters have a similar lifespan. This lunacy is just one part of the current misallocation of VC money which leads to misallocation in the supply chain. But this is just the tip of the iceberg.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are now [376 private unicorn startups](https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies) ($1b+ valuation) in the world with a total market cap of $1.2t. The total capital invested worldwide by VCs in [2018 was $254b and $65b just in Q4 2018](https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/xx/pdf/2019/01/kpmg-venture-pulse-q4-2018.pdf). Just for comparision the US VC investing in 2000, which was largly equilivant to global VC spend because Asia and Europe was to small, reached a peak of [$120b](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-01-08/venture-capital-still-flowing-to-silicon-valley-and-bay-area) in that year. \n\nWhen you exclude Asia from [what VC invested in the last 6 years was](https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/xx/pdf/2019/01/kpmg-venture-pulse-q4-2018.pdf):\n\n|Year|Quarter|US in Billion $|Europe in Billion $|Total EU+US|Mean Total|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2013|Q1|11|2.5 |13.5 |14.2 |\n||Q2|11 |3.3 |14.3 ||\n||Q3|11 |2.9 |13.9 ||\n||Q4|12 |3 |15 ||\n|2014|Q1|15 |3.5 |18.5 |21.4 |\n||Q2|20 |3.5 |23.5 ||\n||Q3|16 |4.2 |20.2 ||\n||Q4|20 |3.4 |23.4 ||\n|2015|Q1|21 |4.5 |25.5 |25.4 |\n||Q2|20 |4.3 |24.3 ||\n||Q3|24 |5.5 |29.5 ||\n||Q4|18 |4.2 |22.2 ||\n|2016|Q1|20 |5.5 |25.5 |24.0 |\n||Q2|25 |4.7 |29.7 ||\n||Q3|17 |4.5 |21.5 ||\n||Q4|15 |4.1 |19.1 ||\n|2017|Q1|16 |4.3 |20.3 |26.0 |\n||Q2|21 |6.2 |27.2 ||\n||Q3|25 |5.1 |30.1 ||\n||Q4|20 |6.3 |26.3 ||\n|2018|Q1|30 |6.3 |36.3 |38.8|\n||Q2|28 |6.3 |34.3 ||\n||Q3|31 |5.6 |36.6 ||\n||Q4|42 |5.9 |47.9 ||\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is 174% (248% when Asia is included) growth over 6 years, or 18% YoY, vs 75% with S&amp;P500 or 128% with nasdaq in the same timeframe (Jan 2013 - Jan 2019). \n\nSo where is all the money going and how much of it is ending on public balance sheets?\n\nNext to employees, as the biggest expense, is Sales &amp; Marketing and tech stack. I assume 40% goes to employees wages 20% S&amp;M, 20% tech and 20% other. \n\nNow how fast are they spending their invested capital? [Monthly Burn rate  for different startup funding phases](https://brex.com/blog/state-of-spend/).\n\n* Pre-Seed: 48% of the companies have a monthly burn &gt; $18k.\n* Seed: 65% of the companies have a monthly burn &gt; $50k and an average capital raise of $1.1m =&gt; They spend 4.5% of their capital per month\n* Series A: 47% of the companies have a monthly burn &gt; $400k and an average capital raise of $8m =&gt; They spend 5% of capital per month \n* Startups which succeeded to exist/raise capital after Series A: 50% of the companies have a monthly burn &gt; $900k raise on average $16.5m =&gt; They spend 5.5% of capital per month \n\nSo a typical startup spends about 15% per Quarter of its invested capital plus its generated revenues, which I neglect from this calculation. $47.9b in one quarter invested from VC then leads to $7.2b additional money spend per quarter for roughly 6 quarters. So tanking the numbers above this leads to:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Year|Quarter|Additional 15% burn rate capital for 6Q in Billion $|Cumulated spend over 6Q in Billion $|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2013|Q1|2.0 |2.0 |\n||Q2|2.1 |4.2 |\n||Q3|2.1 |6.3 |\n||Q4|2.3 |8.5 |\n|2014|Q1|2.8 |11.3 |\n||Q2|3.5 |14.8 |\n||Q3|3.0 |15.8 |\n||Q4|3.5 |17.2 |\n|2015|Q1|3.8 |18.9 |\n||Q2|3.6 |20.3 |\n||Q3|4.4 |22.0 |\n||Q4|3.3 |21.8 |\n|2016|Q1|3.8 |22.6 |\n||Q2|4.5 |23.5 |\n||Q3|3.2 |22.9 |\n||Q4|2.9 |22.1 |\n|2017|Q1|3.0 |20.7 |\n||Q2|4.1 |21.5 |\n||Q3|4.5 |22.2 |\n||Q4|3.9 |21.7 |\n|2018|Q1|5.4 |23.9 |\n||Q2|5.1 |26.2 |\n||Q3|5.5 |28.6 |\n||Q4|7.2 |31.7 |\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo in Q4 2018 approx. $32b was burned by startups, now I use the assumption that 20% of this, about $6.3b, is spend on Sales &amp; Marketing and $6.3b is spend on IT. I also use the [Googles](https://www.statista.com/statistics/266249/advertising-revenue-of-google/) and [Facebooks](https://www.statista.com/statistics/271258/facebooks-advertising-revenue-worldwide/) yearly advertising revenues and average down to a Quarter from 2016 - 2018:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Year|Quarter|Per quarter average Google+Fb revenue in Billion $|20% Percent of  Cumulated VC spend for S&amp;M in Billion $|Ratio|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2016|Q1|26.57 |4.5 |16.98% |\n||Q2|26.57 |4.7 |17.69% |\n||Q3|26.57 |4.6 |17.24% |\n||Q4|26.57 |4.4 |16.66% |\n|2017|Q1|33.83 |4.1 |12.26% |\n||Q2|33.83 |4.3 |12.71% |\n||Q3|33.83 |4.4 |13.12% |\n||Q4|33.83 |4.3 |12.81% |\n|2018|Q1|42.83 |4.8 |11.16% |\n||Q2|42.83 |5.2 |12.22% |\n||Q3|42.83 |5.7 |13.36% |\n||Q4|42.83 |6.3 |14.81% |\n\nSo Googles and Facebooks Adverting business would have 12-15% exposure to Venture Capital induced spending.\n\nAnd Cloud?  AWS has a cloud [market share of 32.3%](https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/cloud-market-share-q4-2018-and-full-year-2018) in Q4 2018. I'm using this [data](https://www.statista.com/statistics/250520/forecast-of-amazon-web-services-revenue/) for their Quarterly revenues. So I'm assuming 32% of the 20% IT budget for AWS:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Year|Quarter|AWS Revenue in Billion $|Startups IT budget in Billion $|Ratio|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2016|Q1|2.6 |1.4 |55.53% |\n||Q2|2.9 |1.5 |51.87% |\n||Q3|3.2 |1.5 |45.81% |\n||Q4|3.5 |1.4 |40.46% |\n|2017|Q1|3.7 |1.3 |35.88% |\n||Q2|4.1 |1.4 |33.55% |\n||Q3|4.6 |1.4 |30.87% |\n||Q4|5.1 |1.4 |27.20% |\n|2018|Q1|5.4 |1.5 |28.32% |\n||Q2|6.1 |1.7 |27.46% |\n||Q3|6.7 |1.8 |27.34% |\n||Q4|7.4 |2.0 |27.44% |\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AWS would have approx. 30% exposure to VC funded Startup revenue.
