If the stock drops, they sue. If there is any bad PR that causes a stock price drop, they sue. Bad earnings report? They sue.\n\nSo how to take advantage? \n\nGet together a group of retards, and make a large bet (100k+) on leaps of whatever company we like. \n\nThe only way a stonk doesn't go up is if there is some really bad news or PR about the company which causes the stonk to drop. Whatever company we choose had better hope there is no bad news that causes a big price drop, or we are going to sue the shit out of them and get our investment back.\n\nIf the Leap is profitable, and company has great quarter after great quarter, everyone is happy and we all walk away big winners.\n\nThis LITERALLY cannot go tits up.", "created_utc": 1581425755, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f27xnj/100000_free_options_plays/", "is_self": true}
