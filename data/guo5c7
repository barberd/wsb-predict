{"id": "guo5c7", "title": "Draftkings vs Fanduel Tech DD", "selftext": "Hello fellow autists, this is my first DD, so please be as rude as possible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nDKNG shares will print, currently at ATH, so it\u2019s hard to predict the near future for options play. Maybe LEAPS if you can afford it (I know you can't, I had to put it in to not be banned).\n\nThere are many catalysts upcoming for Draftkings that are talked about in length, but here is another angle to support the general confidence.\n\nI am a developer, which means I have no clue what I am talking about, but if you are still interested, read on.\n\nOne aspect when it comes to potential growth is that new markets are opening up by legalizing and who might gain the biggest share of those markets. Fanduel and Draftkings are the leading Fantasy Sports Apps and I wanted to understand their technical foundation to judge how they might do.\n\n1. App\n2. Hiring\n3. Tech Stack\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**App**\n\nI'll compare and explain numbers for the Android app.\n\nAs you can see, both apps have a very good rating, but as always the details matter. There is a system called NPS ([Net Promoter Score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter)) that assumes people will be a promoter or detractor or neutral, so we look at 5 and 1-star ratings and ignore the middle as they are deemed neutral.\n\n[DKNG Ratings Android](https://preview.redd.it/yy62p7j3wb251.png?width=656&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f26f9479b173f87cc42b75012505ad5da3e06cd)\n\n[FD Ratings Android](https://preview.redd.it/xg9mjbj3wb251.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a2a02d240d3e0779d02a9457cda9b4769077ceb)\n\nDK has 68k ratings, while FD has 37k, so DK is \\~54% bigger in this segment.\n\nDK has \\~63000 x 5, \\~5000 x 1 which results in 92% promoters and 8% detractors (4.7 stars).\n\nFD has \\~32500 x 5, \\~4500 x 1 which results in 88% promoters and 12% detractors (4.5 stars).\n\nSo while both apps are rated highly, FD actually has 50% more detractors. Why bother?\n\nThere is an important business metric called [Customer Lifetime Value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_lifetime_value#Methodology), where churn rate plays a huge part. And I'll assume for simplicity that detractors represent churn rate. I know this is not necessarily true and there are more factors to it, but just to show how the above numbers are relevant.\n\nSince most of you can't even read, I'll spare you the advanced math, but here is a simple version\n\n(monthly revenue \\* margin) / churn rate, if for both companies monthly revenue per customer (100$) and margin (25%) would be the same\n\n100$ \\* 25% / 8% = 312$ CLT\n\n100$ \\* 25% / 12% = 208$ CLT\n\nso churn rate directly translates to Customer Lifetime Value.\n\nSince DK is already 54% bigger and has way less churn, it will easily outgrow FD further. And fixing broken things in tech is hard, so it is highly unlikely that FD will turn these numbers around.\n\n**Hiring**\n\nI went to both companies open jobs sites ([DKNG](https://careers.draftkings.com/search) [FD](https://www.fanduel.com/open-positions)) and compared how many, what kind of and where the jobs are offered.\n\nThe food chain looks sth like this VP > Principal > Lead > Senior > Junior > Autist, so the higher, the more valuable.\n\nFD 13 jobs, 7 senior (VP, Lead, Senior, Senior, Senior, Senior, Senior)\n\nDK 14 jobs, 11 senior (Principal, Principal, Principal, Lead, Lead, Lead, Senior, Senior, Senior, Senior, Senior)\n\nSo the share of senior positions is a lot higher for DK and the roles themselves are also way higher on average.\n\nThose 14 jobs include 4 Site Reliability positions, which means DK is preparing for a huge influx of users and they continue to put a lot of effort into keeping their stellar user experience.\n\nAnother important factor is where they hire. Think of talent pool, networking options, conferences, and prestige as relevant aspects.\n\nFD hires in Edinburgh (9 out of 13), 2 in NYC, 1 LA, and 1 in Beaverton Oregon.\n\nDK hires in Boston (9) and Dublin (5).\n\nSo Boston has the MIT and a few other universities for talent pool and then Dublin. I know you retards don't even know where Dublin is, but let me tell you that it's a fucking tech hub. Google, Facebook, Microsoft, AWS, and a shit ton more in a rather small city.\n\n**Tech Stack**\n\nI was reading through all the open positions to get a feeling for their tech stack. I was mainly looking for red flags because the tech stack itself does not really mean anything, it's the people who use it after all. Here are the things I felt worth mentioning.\n\nFD uses AWS with container orchestration, so maybe Kubernetes which is pretty modern technology. Their Frontend uses Typescript and GraphQL which is a plus point in my book.\n\nDK uses AWS as well and mentioned Terraform which I rate highly.\n\nNo red flags, but also rather vague, cannot really draw any conclusions from that aspect imo.\n\nTo summarize, DK seems to have a better app, looks way better on the hiring and both probably use solid tech stacks.\n\nAgain, this is only one small aspect but I wanted to give back after having read about DKNG here a few weeks ago, so we can all make some tendies. I am long since DEAC and planning to hold til retirement (pls don't ban).", "created_utc": 1591030396.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/guo5c7/draftkings_vs_fanduel_tech_dd/", "is_self": true}
