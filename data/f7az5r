Massive short interest and was being pushed down by \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b.  Completely lost correlation with oil because of dumb bears.  Well guess what homos...this autist has 3/20 8c that are now in the money, and 10c that will be soon.  And I got them for nothing.\n\nThey just released some news, so we\u2019re getting a nice pop.  Up 24% pre market and could go parabolic\n\nEarnings are Wednesday.  Get in while it\u2019s hot, might be the only green oil stock today.  Time to shake the bears.", "created_utc": 1582291157, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7az5r/crc_moving_big_pre_market/", "is_self": true}
