Ive been a long time lurker and signed up to robinhood two weeks ago. I got a free $9 stock, so I guess Im in the green lol. I got $48 to put on options and dont want to lose our roof. I was robbed about a week ago for my money order for rent and my wallet so I have been SOL and dont want to have us lose our appartment. I have a 4 year old daughter too so I mean this situation truly sucks nuts. I only get paid once a month from my new job and dont get paid until the 13th again. I have been supplementing some dollars here or there through MTurk so its been okay..\n\nNo this isnt a gosh damn pity party, Im here to YOLO YOLO YOLO YOLO some options for $48 to make a whole life YOLO play to pay the rent this month. Fuck! And maybe some tendies!\n\nSo, any strategic advice on some puts or calls to buy for $48 to hopefully start the ball and get near $600? Or what to look for when doing the puts and calls? \n\n(Before you ask, yes I do have enough money for some food and gas for the month. The $48 is all I am willing to risk to hopefully get some money back) \n\nThanks al!", "created_utc": 1569287670, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d8g2sl/so_what_now_48_to_put_on_options_trying_to_make/", "is_self": true}
