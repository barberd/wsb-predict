They've done an amazing job to build up a brand, but this might be the end of that great run.  \n\n**TLDR; YETI p 4/17 (\"spring break\") and beyond pick a number less than an Andrew Jackson and more than the number of Coronas in a six pack.**\n\nIf you don't know what a YETI cooler or cup is by this point you need to get off WSB for like 5 minutes and go outside (but not near other people).  Even fucking Becky, sipping her Truly from her $40 YETI tumbler wiill readily admit it is overpriced Chinese produced stuff and that a Walmart mug at 15% the cost works just as well for keeping her drink cold long enough for her to suck another one down.  \n\nYETI has very limited US manufacturing capability anymore and almost everything comes on the boat from China. Do you think Becky is going to buy another YETI cooler just because they released yet another limited edition color that happens to match the interior of her Range Rover. OK, maybe. But the rest of the YETI army is going to stop buying for the near future. This includes Florida Man, Chad, the Salt Life Bro down the street, that douche with the YETI sticker on his jacked up truck, and fucking Karl, the former drywall guy who now runs fishing charters on his pontoon boat and thinks he is \"sponsored\" by YETI.", "created_utc": 1584549670.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fksk50/how_many_cases_of_corona_can_you_fit_in_a_yeti/", "is_self": true}
