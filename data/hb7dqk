{"id": "hb7dqk", "title": "COST is the perfect hedge right now", "selftext": "Listen up, you fucking autists. Obviously, rona cases are going up. Realistically, we should\u2019ve Beijing\u2019d down when we noticed an uptrend. Except, we won\u2019t because America is dumb as shit and only cares about our god damn economy. Maybe once our GDP slows to a halt like Japan will we actually give a fuck about this pandemic.\n\nBut, there is hope. Valdosta, Georgia closed down businesses again today after a 2x surge in cases. I expect local governments will start revisiting their reopening plans now that more than a dozen U.S. states are seeing the same rise in cases. But I expect some local governments are literally so distracted with race tensions (cough, LA) that they won\u2019t close even their daily cases exceeds New York in March (LA literally has over 50% of California\u2019s cases DAILY). What do you do when your government is so retarded that they won\u2019t quarantine against the virus, when the police won\u2019t protect you from rioters and looters because the country suddenly prefers anarchy over justice? No, you don\u2019t go on Zoom to have your sad excuse for a date. You stock up on bulk frozen goods, canned goods, toilet paper, and board yourself in with your rifle.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re overreacting\u201d\n\nFine. Let\u2019s say that I am. Then what if I told you that there\u2019s a retail company that 50% higher P/E than its competitors (30.1 5-Yr Avg P/E vs. 19.6 in the sector), opened 80 new stores and EPS INCREASED by 14% during the Great Recession. Even if you don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to lockdown again. We are 100% confirmed to be going into a recession according to J. Pow himself. \n\nThat\u2019s why COST is the perfect hedge. Let me dump you some stats I stole from Morningstar:\n\n\u201c[During the last quarter] digital sales rose sharply, up 66% on an adjust basis and nearly 100% in the quarter\u2019s last month.\u201d\n\n\u201cCostco posted over $1,300 in sales per square foot in fiscal 2019, dwarfing Walmart\u2019s roughly $485 mark and Kroger\u2019s nearly $680 \u2026 Costco even comfortably exceeds rival Sam\u2019s Club\u2019s approximately $735 mark, which we believe reflects its greater scale and operating leverage.\u201d\n\n\u201cCostco has averaged mid-single-digit member growth rate globally for the last decade\u2026despite membership fee increases\u2026[which] was roughly a 10% uptick, [and] resulted in no change in the retention rate in fiscal 2018.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter Costco raised U.S. membership fees in 2011, retention moved. Higher by roughly 100 basis points in fiscal 2012. The retention performance comes despite a membership fee that is higher than rival Sam\u2019s Club\u2019s charge ($60 vs. 45 annually.\u201d\n\nThe people shopping at Costco are not the people struggling to pay rent. The people shopping at Costco are the ones dumping their stimulus check into Costco\u2019s (excellently priced) $1,200 TVs. They\u2019re the ones leading to a 90% MEMBERSHIP RENEWAL RATE. Fuck, I cancel my Pornhub membership after the trial but I use that shit every day. They\u2019re the people that literally RETAIN THEIR MEMBERSHIP WHEN THE PRICE INCREASES. Netflix CAN\u2019T pull that off. Amazon CAN\u2019T pull that off. Costco CAN pull that off. That\u2019s because they\u2019re literally the poster child of the perfect company. Their employees get paid an actual wage, SO THEY WON\u2019T HAVE TROUBLE WITH PEOPLE WHO DON\u2019T WANT TO WORK BECAUSE THEY GET PAID MORE DURING UNEMPLOYMENT. Their store employees are diverse, so there\u2019s no risk from the current racial tensions. HAVE YOU HEARD OF A COSTCO GETTING LOOTED? \n\nTL;DR Franz Keto Bread at Costco is amazing.
