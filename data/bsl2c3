{"id": "bsl2c3", "title": "WIX Earnings Tendies", "selftext": "Some of you might remember my DD post on WIX in February. I figured out a way to peg their new subscriber count, earnings, and guidance with a high degree of accuracy based on a tool I have access to through work. Basically I have a good idea of what they\u2019re going to say before they say it, which is gold. Nobody cared since it isn\u2019t a meme stock, so I deleted the post after I was proven right and didn\u2019t bother writing one this earnings.\n\nThis earnings I ended up being off by only 1k subscribers when they have more than four million, so only missed by 0.03%. My revenue estimate was off by $67k when they have $174.3 million, so only missed by 0.04%.\n\nI knew it was going to be a disappointment especially after a 31.5% run-up from last earnings\u2019 crash, so I bought 6 140P @ 4.00 the day before earnings, expiring in two days. It was at $143 and change at the time. Stock tanked after earnings and I sold the next day at 6.00. Easy $1,200 overnight with very little risk. If I timed the exit better I could have doubled up, and if they didn\u2019t fudge their guidance it could have been 3-4x.\n\nProof: https://imgur.com/a/dTjhBwC\n\nPlanning to go harder at it next quarter, this was my first time using the model with real money so I didn\u2019t want to go too crazy.", "created_utc": 1558725842, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bsl2c3/wix_earnings_tendies/", "is_self": true}
