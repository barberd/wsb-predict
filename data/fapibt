They specialize in lab testing, and even if the virus doesn't take off to the point where vaccines are needed, lab testing will be needed one way or another. [CDC's testing](https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download) recommends rNA testers by them, which led me to look into them and saw [this article](https://corporate.qiagen.com/newsroom/press-releases/2020/20200226_coronavirus) about how they're shipping out testing kits.
