He\u2019s broken down the financials for WWE, and even during this pandemic they are raking it in. The loss of live house shows has decreased their expenses. They have maintained their lucrative television deals. Also, the large amount of layoffs have only helped the bottom line. Wrestling without fans sucks, but shareholders love it. \nFrom @wrestlenomics: \nThe average analyst estimate of WWE's earnings per share for 2020 is $1.265. \n\nThat implies a net income of $107.7mm for the year, which would be a company record, ahead of 2018's $99.6mm. The low estimate ($0.85) implies a $69.8mm net income.\n\nI don\u2019t have any positions yet, but I\u2019ll be looking for Jan 2021 calls on Tuesday.", "created_utc": 1590361774.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gpzizj/world_wrestling_entertainment_wwe_headed_for/", "is_self": true}
