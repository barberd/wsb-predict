{"id": "eynd1s", "title": "A few questions about Robinhood margin", "selftext": "Does Robinhood maintain a list of stocks with special concentration requirements, similar to TD Amertirade?  What's always pissed me off about Ameritrade is that they'll let you use your full margin buying power assuming a 30% maintenance requirement, but then immediately hit you with a margin call because the stock you bought is on a special list.  The easier way to do it would have been obviously to program the damn list into the purchasing function to reduce your buying power depending on what you're buying into, but can't expect much from a dinosaur broker like Ameritrade.  How does Robinhood handle that?\n\nAlso, if you go into a call, does Robinhood give you 3-4 days to liquidate (Reg T calls excluding, of course) like other brokers do or do they want you to liquidate the same day?  Do they bug you via phone or email to reduce your position or do they liquidate forcibly?  Is there a liquidation fee?", "created_utc": 1580807033, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eynd1s/a_few_questions_about_robinhood_margin/", "is_self": true}
