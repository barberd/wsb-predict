{"id": "gtpa47", "title": "(Long Post) Research regarding mREIT price adjustment overreaction from February to May", "selftext": "Does anybody else think that mREITs (most notably, Annaly Capital Management (NLY), down 41% since Feb. 20) have been subject to market overreaction and are thus trading well below their reasonable valuation? I'll include some facts and statistics below to show why that might be the case. Some of this will be paraphrased from their recent letters, and some will be my own observations regarding their financial records and how they've changed this year.\n\nBesides NLY, other notable mREIT tickers include MFA and NYMT. NLY is more equipped to deal with payment interruptions than NYMT- as for MFA, I'm not sure yet. If I find data to make a conjecture regarding that, I'll include it below.\n\nMBS stands for Mortgage-Backed Security.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. NLY's Agency MBS- as of March 31, 93% of its assets ($92 billion) are Agency MBS, which have improved liquidity and valuation as a result of the Fed's actions. Since December 31, they have deleveraged and consequently reduced the size of their portfolio from $128 billion to $99 billion (March 31). This action reduced their leverage ratio from 7.2 to 6.8.\n2. Actual forbearance percentages are quite low compared to the relative disturbance in mREIT prices.\"In mid-May the Mortgage Bankers Association indicated that the overall forbearance percentage stood at 8.16%, with Ginnie Mae-backed mortgages at 11.26%, due to a user base that is typically in jobs harder hit by coronavirus shutdowns.\" Comparatively, NLY's stock price has dropped 41%.\n3. The difference between the previous share price and the current share price is much greater than the estimated net income loss per common share (2.40 to 2.60 per share, with the actual share price having dropped 4.34 from Feb. 20th to May 29th). Even with little confidence in the estimation, the estimation would have to be off by approximately a factor of 1.74 to be considered useless (4.34 divided by ((2.4+2.6)/2), aka 4.34/2.5=1.736)\n4. Still paying dividends. On April 30, they paid a dividend of 25 cents on a share price of 6.25 (4% quarterly or 16% annually, which is very good). NYMT, on the other hand, cancelled a recent dividend payout. NLY has paid over $20 billion in dividends since inception.\n5. Book value difference as of March 31st was estimated at 7.40-7.60 (as compared to the March 31st share price of 5.07, and the current (May 29th) share price of 6.16.\n6. Sector rank- Their agency group, comprising 93% of their assets as detailed above, is ranked as the best in its sector.\n\nIf I find any more statistics that are worth posting, I'll add them to this post. Let me know what you all think. Positions disclosure: NLY Aug 21 Call (strike of $8) and NLY Jan 21 2022 Call (strike of $10). Will likely allocate more capital to equity next week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Oh, also, all their execs have been buying shares as of May 4th- scroll to the insider trading section on Finviz.
