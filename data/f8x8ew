With sunnova earnings AH, the best play is 27C RUN 3/20 and evaluate after sunnova pops later today to hold/sell prior to RUN earnings later this week.\n\nAnalysts estimates are stupid low imo and solar has been on a bit of a tear. I could do a serious DD on it but i know you retards dont have the time of day or the patience. \n\nSPCE has recovered today crazily enough, but its IV is stupid high and its bound for wild swings in the next few days. Solar stocks are just on an upward trajectory, and any indication of risk on activity springboards these names higher. \n\nDo it.", "created_utc": 1582574944, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f8x8ew/now_is_the_time_for_run/", "is_self": true}
