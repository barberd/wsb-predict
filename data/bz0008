{"id": "bz0008", "title": "Beyond Meat Autonomy Day?", "selftext": "Since Beyond Meat is now a tech company, I\u2019m wondering when they are going to have their annual event like Apple / Tesla etc showcasing their latest software and product announcement.  \n\nRumors are that they will unveil their Beyond x Richard Mille Tourbillon Watch, and then a plant-based product to rival Air Pods as well.  Less certain about when they will announce their OTT streaming service but apparently the GPU they are also working on is better than both NVDA and AMD ones combined.\n\nThese guys are geniuses and will soon disrupt Amazon.  If you want some math, subtract the entire market cap from Amazon, and add it to Beyond Meat\u2019s market cap, and you get about a trillion dollar valuation which is conservative.", "created_utc": 1560184506, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bz0008/beyond_meat_autonomy_day/", "is_self": true}
