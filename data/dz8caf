My thoughts and prayers go out to this fucking retard and hope to see he posts some gains in a few months. But overall what the fuck WSB we have found a new breed of short bus rider: AMD has to go up 71.7% after already having a 135.57% run this past year at expiration for the *trader* to break even. This person is so fucking autistic that I think he turned me normal and I\u2019m giving my extra chromosome back to the community. Until I can find a player even fucking stupider than this I will be signing off from WSB.", "created_utc": 1574284325, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dz8caf/poor_fellow_buys_amd_70_calls_may_2020_expiry/", "is_self": true}
