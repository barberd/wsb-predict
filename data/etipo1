{"id": "etipo1", "title": "SPCE Pump Is A Scam, Stop Buying It Morons", "selftext": "The Facts:\n\nSPCE used to be IPOA. IPOA was a blank-check company that was price-locked at $10-$11 (look it up).\n\nWhen IPOA became SPCE it essentially rebranded itself with a different mission statement. *SPCE does not produce anything, and is just encountering marketing manipulation.*\n\nDon\u2019t listen to idiots that keep recommending you invest in this shill. They are not your friends. They just want you to continue to pump their position.\n\nDon\u2019t be a greedy fuck &amp; blow your money on investments that don\u2019t make sense. Do research, and remember that for every well-times play there were 100+ poorly timed plays.", "created_utc": 1579909296, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/etipo1/spce_pump_is_a_scam_stop_buying_it_morons/", "is_self": true}
