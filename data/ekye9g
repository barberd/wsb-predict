Every rocket they lauch come back to the ground? why is it any diferent on their chart? I looked at 1hr, 30 min and even the 1 minute charts and the story is all the same, big boom incoming. \n\nLook closely at the picture i provided, you can ignore the math, that was some stuff I am doing for finding a way to calculate personal risk tolerance, but examine the rocket pattern. What happens when it runs out of fuel? what happens when it finds its target? IT WILL come down.
