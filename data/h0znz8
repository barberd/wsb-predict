{"id": "h0znz8", "title": "Fireye (FEYE) - The new normal and the next cold war DD", "selftext": "Alright boys there is a new normal coming, everybody knows this but there are still pieces of the puzzle that people are not connecting that are going to create huge opportunities for certain sectors while punishing others. A sector that should be advancing well BEYOND their pre-covid valuations is cybersecurity. Catalysts in the space\n\n1. **The business office is dead and buried.** Every white collar professional in the country has gotten the taste of what it\u2019s like to live from home. It\u2019s worked, people have adapted and learned how to adjust to their new environments. Businesses are able to operate just as smoothly if not more efficiently then they were prior. Work from home options are going to be table stakes moving forward and companies that do not offer it will lose talent.\n\nThat brings us to FEYE. Before Covid FEYE had already been pivoting away from their hardware-based product business to cloud based subscription model.  With this shift they set themselves up to be a crucial part of that WFH infrastructure. We\u2019ve already seen it with companies like splunk and cloudflare that have shot past their all-time highs as they are poised to capitalize on the new normal. FEYE is one of the most recognizable and trusted names in the space, they are going to be part of this new future.\n\n2. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDrfE9I8\\_hs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDrfE9I8_hs)\n\n**Yep it\u2019s CHYNA**. The new cold war has started. There is no denying this. Luckily for us this one most likely will not be fought with each country on their nuclear triggers. This is cold war will be a cyber war. China (and I\u2019m sure the good ole US of A as well) has been at it for years. It\u2019s seemingly becoming more brazen since the beginning of the pandemic. Already they\u2019ve attempted to steal vaccine data and I doubt has stopped there. This dovetails with the first reason I provided. With an expansion of WFH American businesses are going to be as vulnerable as they ever have been. FEYE is again positioned to be a major part of the WFH security infrastructure and thus protecting us from CHYNA\n\n3. **Valuation go BRRRRRR** \\--- With a strong balance sheet and minimal amount of debt FEYE is very well off financially and put itself in a strong position to take advantage of M&A or invest in it\u2019s business as it sees fit. I\u2019m not going to get into the heavy financial analysis but someone did a DCF on them in March [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-fireeye-inc-nasdaq-135904971.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-fireeye-inc-nasdaq-135904971.html)\n\nIf this nerd knows what he was talking about the fair value for FEYE is $18/share and this was before covid changed the outlook and created this huge opportunity in the space. At $13/share this looks to be great value in the worst case scenario and more likely than not a double or triple by year end.\n\nTo wrap it all up, I\u2019m expecting a huge ratcheting up between the united states and China over the summer. Expect to see more headlines around Chinese cyber attacks and we should be shooting for the moon with Fireye here.\n\nPlays: 9/18 19c or if you\u2019re a hero 6/19 15c\n\nGo get em\n\nTL;dr: FEYE set up to be a critical part of the WFH infrastructure and a key asset in the fight against china.
