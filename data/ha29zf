If you\u2019ve ever done a DCF valuation you know that one down year doesn\u2019t affect a company\u2019s valuation that much. Hell, even if you\u2019ve never done a DCF, you know many of these companies have been around for decades and will be around for decades more. the prospect of one down year shouldn\u2019t take 60% to 80% off your market cap unless you\u2019re levered your the hilt. \n\n2. It\u2019s Donald Fucking Trump. He will do anything to get re-elected. He\u2019s not gonna let the economy be in the shitter come November 3rd. This is a guy who\u2019d never run for President, never held public office, never served in the military, who you\u2019d get laughed out of polite conversation for suggesting he might win, who beat Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Hillary Clinton in a single election cycle. Of course it was gonna be a v-shaped recovery. I know this sub dislikes him but betting against him has been a losing bet for the past 5 years.", "created_utc": 1592307348.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ha29zf/why_it_was_always_going_to_be_a_v_shaped_recovery/", "is_self": true}
