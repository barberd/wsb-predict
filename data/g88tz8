Anyway, one of the recommend channels was a guy \"Why the stock market is crashing | Why I bought 60k in TSLA and SPY puts\" or some other retarded shit. So what do I do? I click on it like every other degenerate here. He goes on with his magical little crayons, and briefly shows a RH position.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI went to his most recent video, and what did he do, opened up a trading program, especially targeting people with \"little knowledge or experience with options\"., and promises them, not  verbatim, but hints that his trading program will help new options traders generate profits. This program costs \\~$400 to enter for the options portion of the \"program\" and an additional \\~\"$400\" for the \"investing\" portion, adding an $800 total on both programs.\n\nAs he's lost well over 100K on SPY puts, and about 30K on TSLA puts\n\nWe might be gamblers, but that is what options are for all retail investors, gambling, we know it's essentially gambling, so telling people, who likley know jack shit about options to blindly join this retards program, by promising \"returns\" is just gay and unethical.\n\nAfter posting one critical comment about his questionable program, I was shawdowrealmed from his comment section.\n\npromising returns at the roulette table is a lie, promising returns on options trading is a lie.", "created_utc": 1587878836.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g88tz8/will_karamanyoutube_channel_an_autistic_scammer/", "is_self": true}
