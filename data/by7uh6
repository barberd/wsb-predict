I hope everyone on this subreddit made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 10th, 2019.\n\n# **The market week ahead: Mexico tariffs and more data that may clear the way for a rate cut  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/07/weekahead-domm-190607-ec.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks have been rallying hard on the idea the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates soon, but at some point the market needs to see progress on the trade wars and economic weakness that are bothering the Fed.\n*****\n&gt; Friday\u2019s surprisingly soft May jobs report showed just 75,000 jobs created, 100,000 less than expected. That immediately raised expectations that the Fed could cut rates as early as July because the long resilient labor market is now seeing the impact of what has already been showing up in manufacturing data.\n*****\n&gt; The stumble in the labor market raises concerns that trade-related weakness in manufacturing will creep into other sectors of the economy. For that reason, economic data, particularly CPI inflation data Wednesday, could be a key market factor in the week ahead, as investors attempt to game when the Fed could cut rates. There are also retail sales and industrial production on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think investors will be nervous around trade and tariffs. Those will continue to drive sentiment next week. I think it\u2019s interesting that you have this idea that the \u2018Powell put,\u2019 the central banks, come in to save the day,\u201d said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. \u201cIt may feel good for investors, and it may extend the cycle longer, but I do think it compounds the longer term problems...Eventually this is going to catch up with the market in some way or other.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; **Mexico tariffs**\n&gt; Investors are awaiting any developments in China, U.S. trade relations, and they are also closely watching developments with Mexico. President Donald Trump has threatened tariffs of 25% on all Mexican goods, starting with a 5% tariff on Monday, if Mexico does not show that it is making progress in stopping migrants from reaching the U.S. On Friday, Trump said in a tweet there\u2019s a good chance a deal will be made with Mexico.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market was shrugging it off this week. It\u2019s been a strong week for the market, so [investors] seems to be taking it in stride,\u201d said Arone, noting investors were looking past the Mexican tariffs for now and focused on the Fed rate cuts. \u201cThe market seems to be applauding [rate cuts] right now, but I\u2019m not sure accommodative monetary policy in itself is enough of a catalyst for better economic growth and better earnings. We need more than that. This could be a bit of a quick hit or a sugar high.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks rallied after the jobs report, with Friday\u2019s gains capping what was already setting up to be the strongest week for stocks since November. The S&amp;P 500 was up 4.4% for the week, ending Friday at 2,873. Treasury yields fell to the lowest levels since December, 2017 in the past week, with the 10-year touching 2.05% on Friday. Fed funds futures also moved sharply, and were forecasting a 95% chance for a quarter point rate cut in July.\n*****\n&gt; Jon Hill, rates strategist at BMO, said the markets are now focused on the timing of a possible Fed rate cut and whether the Fed would cut by a quarter point or a half point initially. That makes economic data especially important, as investors watch to see if weakness has spread to consumers, in the upcoming retail sales report Friday, or whether inflation is weakening. Core CPI has been running above the Fed\u2019s 2% target.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYou would think the [fed funds futures] market is gravitating toward one cut in July, one cut in September and another in December. We have 2.9, 25 basis rate cuts priced in for 2019. This really raises the stakes for next week\u2019s CPI, given core year over year CPI is over 2%, and also now because we\u2019re in the Fed blackout period. There won\u2019t be any additional guidance coming out of the Fed this week.,\u201d said Hill. Fed officials do not speak publicly just ahead of meetings, and they are scheduled to meet June 18.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists have said the market is also holding up on the idea that President Donald Trump would not allow the trade conflicts to get so out of hand that they will cause a stock market collapse, since he views the market as a reflection of his success. That\u2019s the so-called \u2018Trump put.\u2019\n*****\n&gt; Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, J.P. Morgan equity strategist, said if Trump proceeds with his threat to put tariffs on the remaining $300 billion in Chinese goods that could spark a major sell-off in stocks, and the S&amp;P 500 could go as low as 2,500. But he also expects that sell-off would result in both a \u2018Trump\u2019 put and a Fed \u2018put,\u2019 meaning Trump would take some action and the Fed could cut rates to ease financial conditions and help the economy. The strategist said he is maintaining his 3,000 target on the S&amp;P for the year.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe believe the next round of tariffs that the Trump administration is threatening\u2014Mexico 5% and China Phase III\u2014could substantially increase the risk of pushing the U.S. business and profit cycle into an outright contraction,\u201d he wrote. Lakos-Bujas said he still expects trade agreements to be reached, in part because the Trump administration will not want to risk a market collapse or recession, ahead of an election.\n*****\n&gt; Lakos-Bujas said there are a wide range of possible outcomes, including a positive scenario where trade peace is achieved, earnings improve and the S&amp;P shoots higher to 3,200.\n*****\n&gt; In the coming week, investors will also be keeping an eye on China\u2019s data. On Monday, China reports balance of trade, imports and exports, first quarter GDP, current account and foreign exchange reserves. Chinese inflation data is released on Wednesday.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/AvJ2qyS.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/T9e0ObK.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/YKXy9i9.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/8v3NKIM.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9gMfvdY.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/yChCQrn.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/00uvffV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/VcDWeCO.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Xrf6h4m.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PziPmuo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/k0siEgZ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/XzHyZzj.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Not a Triple Top Yet \u2013 Support Has Held\n\n&gt; There has been a lot of chatter recently about an imminent \u201ctriple top\u2019 for the market across the January 2018, September 2018 and recent April 30, 2019 highs. It\u2019s not a triple top until it breaks support levels. Traders do need to be watching for support levels to be broken - which we have recently held.\n\n&gt; Holding support was bullish technical action. But remember this is the Worst Six Months and we expect more volatility, more testing of support and more sideways action \u2013 backing and filling \u2013 over the weaker summer months.\n\n&gt; We talked about these support levels on the blog a month ago as well. Here\u2019s an update to the chart from that May 7 blog post. I added some additional support levels. S&amp;P 500 level of 2580 at February/April 2018lows is critical support \u2013 a 12.4% correction.\n\n&gt; Breaking that level would bring the December 2018 lows into play, which would be bear market territory of -20% \u2013 and likely the low and a great buying opportunity. Good thing we are already in Worst Six Months Defense Mode since we shifted to market neutral after our official Best Six Months MACD Seasonal Sell signal for DJIA and S&amp;P 500 on May 1.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/36ed5cbc048410e6f6dcc0418a54096b/tumblr_inline_psp0j7ANWX1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Seasonally, Bonds Have Plenty of Room Left to Run\n\n&gt; Barring some rather abrupt reversal in the current trend in trade, tariffs, tariffs and even higher tariffs, bonds could have even more upside in their near-term futures. Back in the beginning of April we noted the 30-year treasury bond had a seasonal tendency to dip in April and early May (around the time stocks like to make a seasonal high) before moving higher from sometime in May through the end of August. Thus far this year this trade has been a perfect textbook setup. \n\n&gt; In the following chart weekly bars of the 30-year Treasury bond future appear on top with their seasonal trend since August 26, 1977. The 30-year Treasury bond did dip in April and as trade war concerns grew in May, as stocks slipped, bonds ripped higher. The recent rise has been brisk but considering the retreat in tech stocks further gains are not out of the question.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4c257107bcc73a5d12c72c5104c601bc/tumblr_inline_psjlfiUplt1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Bespoke Report -- Negative Void Coefficient\n\n&gt; Equity markets surged despite short term interest rate markets pricing near-certainty of multiple Fed rate cuts this year. How can an economy so bad that the Fed needs to cut mean stocks go up? We take a look around for some answers. We also review just how dovish the Fed has been relative to what markets have been pricing of late. While the domestic economy has definitely slowed down from the torrid pace of 2018, even the disappointing nonfarm payrolls number today paints a different picture than assumptions of multiple cuts from the front end. The global economy is less constructive, but there's a difference between weakness and a recession panic, as we show. Finally, we present an argument for why Fed rate cuts may not be necessary for the economy to stabilize and start to pick up again thanks to negative feedback loops.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/060719-BR-Sample.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for June 7th, 2019** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUzJbCiykLE))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 06.09.19** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$LULU** \n&gt; * **$THO** \n&gt; * **$AVGO** \n&gt; * **$UXIN** \n&gt; * **$HRB** \n&gt; * **$RH** \n&gt; * **$PLAY** \n&gt; * **$HDS** \n&gt; * **$FGP** \n&gt; * **$LOVE** \n&gt; * **$CHS** \n&gt; * **$TLRD** \n&gt; * **$SECO** \n&gt; * **$DLTH** \n&gt; * **$SHLO** \n&gt; * **$ASNA** \n&gt; * **$CPST** \n&gt; * **$JW.A** \n&gt; * **$AZRE** \n&gt; * **$ADXS** \n&gt; * **$CASY** \n&gt; * **$LMNR** \n&gt; * **$BBCP** \n&gt; * **$NEPT** \n&gt; * **$OXM** \n&gt; * **$SPCB** \n&gt; * **$DEST** \n&gt; * **$TMDX** \n&gt; * **$CBKC** \n&gt; * **$TUFN** \n&gt; * **$LIVX** \n&gt; * **$RENN** \n&gt; * **$SMMT** \n&gt; * **$CRWS** \n&gt; * **$UROV** \n&gt; * **$CUP**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/Xrf6h4m.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/tjVIyC3.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/XUmf17n.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.10.19 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fWAqTKe.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.10.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1EV06lf.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.11.19 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/XiD6PSJ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.11.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/w4crV2U.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.12.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.12.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vj1y4AK.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.13.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/6PhL91b.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.13.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oW0TFBe.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.14.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.14.19 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# lululemon athletica inc. $172.49 \n&gt; **lululemon athletica inc.
