{"id": "gm4gnb", "title": "The Bull DD of Doom", "selftext": "As I look at my account, exactly even on the year after making thousands and losing thousands, I have come up with a retarded theory.  If past results are indicative of future results, this is probably wrong, but I tend to do alright on my long term hunches, it\u2019s the short term ones that burn me.  I am not true retard, but semi intelligent, so take what I say with a grain of salt.\n\nI am going to make the case that we are on the precipice of a massive bull run of the likes not seen since 1999 and early 2000.\n\nAt the moment, there are two sentiment camps.  One is the bearish case, led by booffet and drunkenmiller.  You all know this one\u2026economy is fucked, GDP in the shitter, EPS growth dead.  Surprisingly, this is the consensus view.  If you think you are being a contrarian by being bearish, you are not.  You are sheep.  Take a look at TDA\u2019s movement index, or AAII bull/bear ratio below.  People are super bearish on the economy.\n\nhttps://imx.tdameritrade.com/imx/p/imx-pub/\nhttps://www.yardeni.com/pub/peacockbullbear.pdf\n\nThe other camp is the moderately positive camp.  You have probably heard this one as it\u2019s led by CNBC and other tard outlets.  Basically we will get a vaccine, nothing is structurally wrong with economy, just a temporary virus, Fed will smooth out the liquidity issues, 2020 is a blip year and good times will start again in 2021\u2026yada yada yada.  \n\nMy theory is they are both wrong!  The first camp is super smart and sounds intelligent, but that doesn\u2019t get you anywhere in the market, we know that.  The second camp is true retard, so like anything they luck into being semi right.\n\nThe truth is we are going to moon in a way that is straight scandalous.  The Fed has opened Pandora\u2019s box.  Have you seen M2 lately?  M2 is a measurement of money supply.  Here is M2 and velocity of M2 within the economy.\n\nhttps://themarketear.com/posts/cXmUXXuzj5/image/0\n\nWhat this tells you is the Fed is printing in a way never seen before, and all that money is not moving through the real GDP generating economy.  Take a look at this picture of M2 and SPY YoY growth:\n\nhttps://tme1.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/a834209413d62e93809f5ee8521513f6\n\nM2 leads SPY returns by around 250 days.  So what we are getting in the market now is just a taste.  A taste of the bull ramming that is to come\n\nSee traders and investors have figured out what QE and the Fed printing does.  We didn\u2019t know back in 2010 and 2011.  It was a new experiment and a lot of skeptics were very bearish for very good reasons.  But now we know that all that money printing goes right into risk assets.  As rates approach 0%, valuations approach infinity.\n\nBut unlike 2010-11, commissions for stock trades are at $0 with many brokers.  Which means this Fed QE experiment is going to be fueled by the FOMO of millennials who are tired of being fucked by their divorced boomer parents.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/12/young-investors-pile-into-stocks-seeing-generational-buying-moment-instead-of-risk.html\n\nAlso, as an aside check out DIX:\n\nhttps://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/dix?\n\nDark pool bottomed March 20-25 and has not let up on the buying since.  Been following this indicator for a couple years now and is the sole reason I am not negative in my account as I have not been shorting every top in this rally\n\nSo, to sum up the vision for the next few years and how people get fucked (I hope I am wrong).\n\nFirst, retail traders piling into all these 2000 P/E stocks are going to get screwed with a down turn this year.  This is a pretty safe assumption, but good luck timing it.  Sentiment needs to get more bullish for that to happen.  Boofet and his crew will feel smart.\n\nAs 2021 dawns, the market will make a nice rebound.  Everyone will feel satisfied.  The millennials who held will feel smug (\u201cI hold for the long term!\u201d).  Smart investors will grumble but at least they got a little bear market.  Trump will talk about how great his handling of the crisis is, and we can all put this behind us.\n\nBut something odd is happening, the market is not slowly marching higher\u2026it is going up a lot.  At first people will be happy; things are better than expected!  Then we will have our first +10% month.  Then a +20% month.  \n\nWe have spent all this time trying to avoid a bear market and deflation.  But something about this isn\u2019t right.  As the market chugs higher, the horror of our situation will dawn on us.  Inflation is still under control\u2026TVs are cheap as shit, even though Gold is going through the roof.  Oil is cheap too as any time oil peaks its head above 50, the frakers beat their meat with renewed vigor. The Fed will try and put a lid on it, but as soon as they stop growing their balance sheet, stocks take the ultimate shit, hitting circuit breakers in the blink of an eye.  The reason it takes a shit is the death of small business from the lock downs.   All that is left are zombie companies that don\u2019t make money but just keep rolling free debt.  If interest rates rise, these zombies die\u2026again.\n\nWe can see this happening right now.  With interest rates null and the Fed buying their debt, companies are going on a borrowing spree.  Just check out corporate issuance forecasts:\n\nhttps://themarketear.com/posts/cnAvowpp91/image/0 \n\nWhere is all that borrowed money going to go?  Shareholders!  Just like last time.  Although this time talks about laws being passed against buybacks will rally the sheep.  But the market is up and getting rid of buy backs will stop the party rather quickly, so that won\u2019t get far.\n\nAll of this combines to make 2021-22 triple digit years.  P/E ratios won\u2019t matter, because interest rates are at 0% or negative.  The difference between the rich and poor will balloon, but unlike last QE, we will still have millions unemployed and pissed off.  The gravity of the govt\u2019s error will dawn on them as they see the true cost of focusing on wall street above main street.\n\nEmployment won\u2019t bounce back like 2010-11 because there are just not as many businesses left\u2026and starting a business will be no good as margins are non-existent.  They are going to have many people very angry watching big companies and risk assets make money at seriously ludicrous levels.\n\nSo the strangest thing will happen, as LA burns and riots break out in New Jersey, SPX will hit 6k on a 5% up day.\n\nTLDR: Greenspan showed the way to make bubbles; the Fed has now perfected it.  QE works way better than imagined.  Money supply sky rocketing. Retail traders fuel massive stock market bubble while country burns.  Small and medium businesses die.  Massive unemployment. Only companies with access to cheap debt markets survive.      \n\nSPY 350 Jan 2022 Calls are cheap", "created_utc": 1589818550.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gm4gnb/the_bull_dd_of_doom/", "is_self": true}
