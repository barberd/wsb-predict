{"id": "fmk7lh", "title": "Mexico DD: Short EWW", "selftext": "Mexico is completely and utterly unprepared for this pandemic and the economy is going into this recession in an unbelievably fragile state \u2013 EWW has a long way to go.\n\n**Healthcare Statistics**\n\nOut of \u201cdeveloped\u201d economies, Mexico has literally the lowest number of standard hospital beds per person\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_countries\\_by\\_hospital\\_beds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_hospital_beds)\n\nMexico has \\~1.4 bed per thousand people. Compares this to other countries where the virus has spread dramatically \u2013 Italy for example, has \\~3.2 beds thousand people (which is even considered low-tier).\n\nNow the more important statistic is the number of ICU beds per person. Mexico has 2.33 ICU beds *per 100,000 people.* This compares to the US at 34.7, Italy at 12.5, South Korea at 10.6, etc. Not good.\n\nCounty Data: [https://www.statista.com/chart/21105/number-of-critical-care-beds-per-100000-inhabitants/](https://www.statista.com/chart/21105/number-of-critical-care-beds-per-100000-inhabitants/)\n\nMexico Data: [https://www.animalpolitico.com/2020/03/pocas-camas-hospital-baja-proporcion-medicos-enfrentaria-mexico-covid-19/](https://www.animalpolitico.com/2020/03/pocas-camas-hospital-baja-proporcion-medicos-enfrentaria-mexico-covid-19/)\n\nMexico has a generally unhealthy population. For example, they have the third highest obesity rate in the OECD (\\~33.0%). They also have the second lowest amount of federal spending on healthcare services in the OECD. [http://www.oecd.org/economy/mexico-economic-snapshot/](http://www.oecd.org/economy/mexico-economic-snapshot/)\n\nDeath rates are going to the moon once the virus begins to accelerate. The healthcare system will totally fail. People will panic, riots will start to take place, and labor availability will go to zero.\n\n**Government Intervention**\n\nThe president of Mexico is admittedly ignoring the virus and the inevitable impact it will have on Mexico\u2019s economy. He has publically said things like \u201cI have great faith that we will move our dear Mexico forward, that misfortunes and pandemics won\u2019t affect us\u201d\n\nMexico has performed a a very small number of tests for the virus to date. Latest data shows that they have performed 278 tests (likely more by now but not by much) \u2013 expect the number of cases to increase immensely as test are conducted. Let\u2019s compare the number of tests per capita:\n\nMexico: 278 tests / 134MM people: 0.000002 per person\n\nUnited States: 103,945 tests / 331MM people: 0.00031 per person\n\nItaly: 206,886 tests / 59MM people: 0.0035 per person\n\nCanada: 113,121 tests / 38MM people: 0.0030 per person\n\nBrazil: 2,927 tests / 214MM people: 0.00001 per person\n\nIndia: 14,514 tests / 1.4BN people: 0.00001 per person\n\nMexico is still taking a business-as-usual approach, and has not yet closed borders, dock, airports, etc. nor have they declared a state of emergency, ordered businesses to shut down or instituted work from home policies (they have now begun to \u201cencourage\u201d some of these, including social distancing). The only measures the President has put in place is literally praying to amulets that will provide a protective shield \u2013 seriously.\n\n**Mexican Economy**\n\nServices represents over 60% of the economies GDP, including sectors such as transportation, commerce, warehousing, restaurant and hotels, arts and entertainment, health, education, financial and banking services. Once the virus begins to take hold of the country, the big part of this sector will completely halt to a stop \u2013 60% of the economy.\n\nThe energy sector is also a major driver of GDP for Mexico. Mexican oil reached $14.0 per barrel last week.\n\nThe manufacturing sector in Mexico is another major component of the economy, specifically car manufacturing. As labor availability falls through the floor, plants will not be able to operate and will eventually shut down. The triple whammy of supply chain disruptions, carmaker shutdowns, and a collapse oil in prices are going to kill this economy. Fitch, Moody\u2019s and S&P\u2019s all have a negative outlook on Pemex\u2019s creditworthiness, meaning that there is almost definitely going to be further downgrades as the year progresses.\n\nPeak to trough in 2008, EWW fell \\~55.0%. This recession in Mexico will be much worse and longer drawn out the 2008 recession, destroying both supply and demand. EWW is currently down, 2020 peak to trough, about 40%.\n\nTL;DR: Mexican economy is going to absolutely tank. Buy puts on EWW.\n\nEWW P 17APR20 25.00; EWW P 19Jun20 20.00", "created_utc": 1584817501.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmk7lh/mexico_dd_short_eww/", "is_self": true}
