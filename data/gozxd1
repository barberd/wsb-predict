{"id": "gozxd1", "title": "Made some stupid option trades", "selftext": "First it was a Boeing put a few weeks back that lost me a little over 2k. \n\nThen a tesla call that lost me around 1500\n\nThen a apple put $1500 and that one was because I purchase wrong day for expiration, next day\n\nAt last 1500 lost on fb calls. \n\nAll we\u2019re learning experiences that made my gains look like crap. I deposited 7k a few weeks ago about 3 and this has been my journey. Profited about 3k or so and held to recover over 5k or so losses \n\nI came into the market hoping to bet against it with puts. I\u2019ve been playing since 2017. This year I was trying options with the most I\u2019ve traded with yet. \n\nImmediately I\u2019ve learned puts were not as popular with everything recovering and the fed injections.\n\nI have accepted that we do not know exactly which way the s and p 500 will go 6 months it\u2019s all speculation. \n\nI have decided to buy some shares of companies with holding and will call or put depending on there price action. \n\nThinking that I couldn\u2019t invest in this market for long term hedging seems like a smart way to use options instead of placing bets all the time. \n\nI am a planning to stick to following spy more as I am trading. I have noticed that not all stocks follow the spy as fast but after an hour or so with the spy legging up or down most stocks will re act. \n\nExcept for penny stocks which is I gave that up in 2018 except for the occasional rush.  \n\nI have been playing options for a while but with deciding to get back in full throttle these last few weeks it has been very numbing. Kind of a blow to the ego because I expected to win more then I lost. \n\nTruly glad I for the experience gained with these weeks got a great refresh of what to expect.\n\nI found this sub Reddit a few weeks ago and then found again today when on YouTube. This group makes me realize that we all make bets rather big or small for different reasons. Some win some loose. \n\nI\u2019m still new in this as compared to a seasoned and profitable trader but I have been trying to learn and teach my self as much as I can. \n\nI\u2019m looking forward to next week and just wanted to vent some because some of y\u2019all losses made me feel a lot better about the few times I traded up and recovered my losses. Last that I\u2019m not holding any major positions option wise over this weekend. \n\nI have a Macy call for July and a PCG call for July both I am not worried about\n\nPeace", "created_utc": 1590213940.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gozxd1/made_some_stupid_option_trades/", "is_self": true}
