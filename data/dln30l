(BIIB + $79.49 to $303.00): The biotech giant reported Q3 earnings of $9.17 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.95 beat) on revenue that rose 4.7% year-over-year to $3.6B (above the $3.53B expected). Sales of the company\u2019s rare muscle disease drug Spinraza increased to $547M from $468M year-over-year. Concurrent with the earnings release, Biogen said that it plans to seek U.S. regulatory approval for its Alzheimer\u2019s treatment (aducanumab) after conducting new analysis of clinical trials. Option volume is heavy today (5x avg. daily volume of 14K contracts) and put-biased (3:2 over calls) but the October 25th 300.00 call is topping the most actives list (volume is 7,611).\nProcter &amp; Gamble Co. (PG + $5.42 to $124.50): The consumer products company reported fiscal Q1 earnings of $1.37 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.13 beat) on revenue that rose 6.6% year-over-year to $17.8B (above the $17.43B expected) as organic sales increased 7% year-over-year. The company raised full-year 2020 core EPS to a range of +5-10% from +4-9% and revenue guidance to +3-5% from +3-4%. Calls are outnumbering puts roughly 5:3 with the October 25th 123.00 call being the most actively traded contract (volume is 5,312).\nSherwin Williams Co. (SHW + $19.58 to $569.99): The paint company reported Q3 earnings of $6.65 per share, ($0.15 beat) on revenue that increased 2.9% year-over-year to $4.87B (above the $4.83B expected). The company issued in-line guidance as full-year 2019 EPS is expected to come in a range of $20.90-21.30 (vs. the $21.07 consensus estimate) with net sales expected to increase by a low single digit vs. FY2018. Calls and puts are trading roughly even with the November 15th 550.00 put being the most actively traded contract (volume is 259).\nUnited Technologies Corp. (UTX + $3.27 to $141.50): The aerospace and industrial company reported Q3 earnings of $2.21 per share ($0.18 beat) on revenue that increased 18.1% year-over-year to $19.5B (above the $19.31B expected). Additionally, the company raised full-year 2019 EPS to a range of $8.05-8.15 (from $7.90-8.05) on revenue of $76.0-76.5B (from $75.5-77.0B) while free cash flow is expected to be $5.3-5.7B (from $4.5-5.0B). Calls are outnumbering puts roughly 4:3 with the November 15th 140.00 call seeing the most action from traders (volume is 983).\n \n\nNew 52-week highs (119 new highs today): Apple Inc. (AAPL + $1.16 to $241.67), Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY + $3.06 to $56.26), Dominion Resources Inc. (D + $0.26 to $82.68), Phillips 66 Inc. (PSX + $0.23 to $108.43), Target Corp. (TGT + $0.70 to $114.38)\n\nNotable Call Activity\n\nOption traders appear to be optimistic about Microsoft Corp. (MSFT - $0.23 to $138.20) ahead of the software giant\u2019s fiscal Q1 earnings report which is scheduled to be released after the market close tomorrow. Calls are outpacing puts roughly 5:1 with particular attention going towards the 150.00 call which expires at the end of this week (October 25th). Volume on this contract, which is the highest volume option contract (across all stocks, indexes or ETFs) on the board today, is 70,660 (vs. open interest of 3,356) which mostly consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought at various ask prices, which suggests bullish intent. Note: MSFT\u2019s all-time high is $142.37 which was hit back on September 19th.\n\nAlso seeing some heavy call activity (~3:1 over puts) is NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA + $1.44 to $197.46) as all of the top 8 most actively traded contracts are calls. The top two most actively traded contracts are the October 25th 200.00 call (volume is 13,023 vs. open interest of 4,521) and 205.00 call (volume is 4,556 vs. open interest of 1,297). Today\u2019s call activity may be technically-driven as shares of NVDA hit $202.53 earlier in the session, which represents the highest price since November 15th, 2018.   \n\nToday\u2019s Bearish Activity \n\nSeveral stocks are trading lower following quarterly earnings results:\n\nHasbro Inc. (HAS - $18.10 to $102.05): The toy maker reported Q3 earnings of $1.84 per share, ($0.33 miss) on revenue the rose 0.3% year-over-year to $1.58B (below the $1.71B analysts had expected). Operating margins in the U.S. and Canada weakened to 21.6% from 24.5% but increased slightly in the International segment (to 12.0% from 11.8%). The company said results were hampered by higher shipping and warehouse costs on toys imported from China (due to the threat of tariffs) as well as softening toy demand (as customers switch to video games). Puts are outnumbering calls roughly 4:3 with the October 25th 103.00 put garnering the most attention from traders (volume is 1,242).\nKimberly-Clark Corp. (KMB - $9.20 to $129.99): The manufacturer of U.S. household and personal care products reported Q3 earnings of $1.84 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.05 beat) on revenue that increased 1.3% year-over-year to $4.64B (below the $4.66B expected). The company issued in-line guidance as full-year 2019 EPS is expected to come in a range of $6.75-6.90 (from $6.65-6.80) and raised organic sales guidance to increase 3-4% from +3%. Shares of KMB are trading roughly 1% above the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of $128.80 at the time of this writing. Calls and puts are trading roughly even with the April 2020125.00 put leading the way (volume is 409).\nMcDonald\u2019s Corp. (MCD - $6.70 to $203.15): The fast food chain reported Q3 earnings of $2.11 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.10 miss) on revenue that increased 1.1% year-over-year to $5.43B (below the $5.47B expected). U.S. same-store sales growth was +4.8%, below the 5.17% analysts had expected (though global comparable same-store sales of +5.9% was above estimates). Shares of MCD are trading at a four-month low following the results. Calls are outnumbering puts roughly 3:2 but the October 25th 200.00 put is seeing the most action from traders (volume is 4,669).\nTraveler\u2019s Companies Inc. (TRV - $10.56 to $131.35): The insurer reported Q3 earnings of $1.43 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.92 miss) on revenue that increased 7.2% year-over-year to $7.57B (above the $7.17B expected). Core return on equity came in at 6.5%, down from 12.0% in the prior year. Today\u2019s ~7% drop puts the stock at a seven-month low and below the 200-day SMA. Puts are outnumbering calls roughly 3:2 with the November 15th 130.00 put leading the way (volume is 995).\n \n\nNew 52-week lows (42 new lows today): Big Lots Inc. (BIG - $0.20 to $20.12), CBS Corp. (CBS - $0.44 to $35.91), Teredata Corp. (TDC - $0.23 to $28.55)\n\nNotable Put Activity\n\nSome unusual put activity (~3:1 over calls) is being seen in Uber Technologies Inc. (UBER - $1.14 to $30.27) as option traders primarily target the March 2020 25.00 put. Volume on this contract is 6,290 (vs. open interest of 25,041) which nearly entirely consisted of a 6,200 block that was bought at the ask price of $1.80. It\u2019s likely that this block is a new position given the expiration date but we can\u2019t be sure given the open interest figure. From a technical perspective, shares of UBER ran up into resistance at the 50-day SMA (currently $32.28) over the past couple of trading days.  \n\nVolume Signals     \n\niShares MSCI Europe Financials ETF (EUFN + $0.01 to $18.73): Option volume is running at over 27x the daily average of 442 contracts which is primarily being driven by activity on the January 2020 20.00 call. Volume on this contract is 12,330 (vs. open interest of 749) which mostly consisted of a 6,666 block that was bought at the ask price of $0.15 and (at a later time) a 3,284 block that was bought at the ask price of $0.20. We know both of these blocks are new positions based on the open interest figure and we can assume the intent is bullish in nature since the trades took place at the ask price.  \n\nC H Robinson Worldwide Inc. (CHRW + $1.56 to $88.37): Option volume is running at over 12x the daily average of 510 contracts which is primarily being driven by activity on the November 15th 87.50 call. Volume on this contract is 3,176 (vs. open interest of 2,027) which mostly consisted of a 2,970 block. We know this block is a new position given the open interest figure and we can assume the intent is bullish in nature since the trade took place at the ask price. The positioning comes ahead of the company\u2019s Q3 earnings report which is scheduled to be released after the market close on October 29th.\n\nGossamer Bio Inc. (GOSS + $0.61 to $17.57): Option volume is running at over 7x the daily average of 1,904 contracts which is primarily being driven by an 8,000 block that was bought for $0.34 when the bid/ask spread was $0.00 x $0.50 (open interest is 13,713). However, since the block size is below open interest we don\u2019t know whether this is a new position or not.\n\nGauging Volatility\n\nThe CBOE Volatility Index (VIX - 0.26 to 13.74) has been on both sides of the unchanged line today (intraday range is 13.74-14.29) as equity markets are mixed around the mid-day mark today (DJI + 104, SPX + 7, COMPX - 5). VIX option volume has been tepid today (currently missing from the top 10 most actives list) and the activity has been definitively call-biased (the volume put/call ratio is currently 0.17). The most actively traded contract is the November 20th 21.00 call as volume is 14,505 versus open interest of 51,245.  \n\nShares of Facebook Inc. (FB - $6.09 to $183.67) are seeing a late-morning sell-off following news that an antitrust probe by U.S. states has expanded to 47 attorneys general and average implied volatility is getting a slight lift as a result (from 33% to the current level of 35%). Topping the most actives list among FB options at the moment is the October 25th 185.00 put (volume is 20,973 vs. open interest of 4,782). Note: the average implied volatility represents an estimated value for a 30-day implied volatility at the current underlying price, based on a curve fit of option implied volatilities.            \n\nChipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (CMG - $20.81 to $830.73): Average implied volatility is at 40% today ahead of the company\u2019s Q3 earnings release after the market close today, which is 4 ticks higher than last quarter\u2019s earnings release heading into the report (~36%), but below the average IV in the prior three quarters (which ranged from 43-50%). CMG\u2019s volume put/call ratio is hovering right around the flat line today (1.01) with the October 25th 800.00 put seeing the most action from traders.", "created_utc": 1571772842, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dln30l/options_market_102219/", "is_self": true}
