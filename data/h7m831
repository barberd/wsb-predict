I like undervalued stocks. It means they are sold at a discount and when their fundamentals are positive, it means the stock will go up again. I stumbled upon one that met all my indicators.\n\nI\u2019m talking about Meridian Bancorp, aka EBSB.\n\nHere are some fundamentals:\n\nMarket capital is 570+ million. Profit to earnings to growth (PEG) is lower than 1, which is favorable meaning the stock price is lower than it actually should be. Return on investment according to FINVIZ is over 20%, meaning if you let it cook for some time, it might see some juicy gains, rare, medium or even well-done; whichever you prefer. Price to cash ratio is positive too, lower than 3. Revenue has grown every year from 2016 onward (130ish million to 190ish million), as did earnings (30ish million to 65ish million).\n\nHaving a look at the technicals:\n\nThe stock price is below its 20-day moving average. It\u2019s below its 50-day moving average and surprise surprise, it\u2019s below its 200-day moving average. This adds to the undervalued part of the stock, meaning it\u2019s cheaper than it is on average. Relative Strength Index (RSI) tells me it is not overbought. It\u2019s around middle, meaning it has room for more upside.\n\nAverage volume is over 50k and analyst recommendation is \u201cbuy or better\u201d. To add to that, the last three quarter earnings it managed to do the following: BEAT by 0.09 > MEET at 0.25 > MEET at 0.25. Next quarterly earnings are in July, which means the positive history might increase the stock value as it gets closer to earnings date.\n\nYahoo Finance tells us recommendation trends are to HOLD the stock, while the rest consists of either BUY or STRONG BUY, indicating the prediction of this stock price rising in the future.\n\n\u00a0\n\nStill not convinced? Let me try it in WSB-wording:\n\n1. EBSBaby: this refers to WSB-baby, which can easily be linked with the EBSB-ticker.\n\n2. The company's name is Meridian Bancorp: a corp that bans, just like WSB!\n\n3. Positive is a good word. This stock is positive.\n\n4. Meridian sounds like a cool town in the world of Pok\u00e9mon. The slogan of Pok\u00e9mon is \u201ccatch \u2018em all!\u201d, which correlates to money. Catch it all!\n\n\u00a0\n\nCurrent positions:\n\nAugust 21 $15C\n\nAugust 21 $17.5C", "created_utc": 1591973965.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h7m831/positive_growth_prediction_in_ebsb_baby/", "is_self": true}
