Solid, thanks dude!\n\nWednesday is the big day. \n\nhttps://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6939045-Justice-in-Policing-Act.html\n\nThis legislation expects to require nationwide use of body cameras, according to congressional sources (Section 372). Also reported in major outlets (APnews, Reuter\u2019s, NYTimes, CNBC). I fully expect this to pass, but even if it doesn\u2019t, stay tuned for tendies. \n\nAAXN is well known in law enforcement equipment. Very qualitative company. DGLY has been around for 20 years and is viewed as inferior in some aspects, but has investor volatility potential. \n\n- DGLY recently sold $2.5mil of cameras to the KCPD, which has only 1,400 police officers, as each camera costs $500-$1,500.\n- There are 150,000 federal uniformed officers to which the bill directly applies to and an additional 650,000 state and local officers indirectly affected. \n- Some math tells us that this is an estimated $225mil-nearly $1bil in revenue. \n- This is not solely confined to state lines Canada as well utilizes Axon and Digital Ally cameras as well. The Calgary Police Dept has Digital Ally. Toronto set to begin to using cameras this summer. \n- During the Ferguson riots, DGLY hit $30 without any legislation motion. \n- DGLY just unveiled a new subscription program this morning for its cameras to offset an offering revision that had already been in the works far before the riots. \n\nShould this legislation not pass, we\u2019re still at the start of this run, as there is renewed demand for these cameras at the state level. \n\nI believe it will pass, and am holding at least through June in the idea it does, but whether or not, I believe we can see AAXN approaching $110 or higher and DGLY approaching $20.\n\nDGLY $5c 6/19 + shares \nAAXN $100c 6/19, $110c July", "created_utc": 1591637434.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gz3qxh/dgly_and_aaxn_stand_to_reap_profits_from_the/", "is_self": true}
