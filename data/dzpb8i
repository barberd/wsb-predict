{"id": "dzpb8i", "title": "Currently Have Downs But Want To Learn Autism", "selftext": "I\u2019ve worked for a large Bank Dealer selling fixed income securities to institutional investors for the past 10 years. This has taught me a case of severe down syndrome. I can run circles around most of my downey fixed income peers on a BB terminal, but only when it comes to the down syndrome market. The problem is... yields blow dingus in the down syndrome markets. My clients rarely ever answer my phone calls because who wants to be sold some down syndrome maturing in 30 years that will yield their portfolio less than the homeless boomer on their street corner makes in an hour? My clients see \u201cdown syndrome broker\u201d pop up on their caller ID and I get nothing but voicemail.\n\nHere\u2019s where you autistic fucks come in to play. This gives me about 4 hours everyday with nothing to do but learn some autism on my Bloomberg. Any severe autists out there know how can I use my BB terminal to start getting those sweet sweet tendies? Teach me how to autism on a BB.", "created_utc": 1574367882, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dzpb8i/currently_have_downs_but_want_to_learn_autism/", "is_self": true}
