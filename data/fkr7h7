This is the chance before domestic travel gets canceled to get in on it before the final tank and then bailout. I chose them because they have good customer service, but most of their flights are domestic, so they were impacted LESS than the other airlines by the international travel bans. Even as of this morning, flights are finally cheaper to book on them.\n\nLook, I love Southwest Airlines. However, their hubs are just going to continue to get obliterated. I don't think government intervention saves them. Not this time. I had a coworker(boomer) tell me that they had bought $LUV in the 30's many times and sell in the 50's many times, I just don't think this is the case.\n\nAs such, two days ago I bought 40 May 15 20P, paid $1.59 for them. Planning to hold until I'm ITM or they expire.\n\nOh I've made the money on SPY puts, Twitter Puts, EWG Puts(200 of which expire this friday and I'm fucked on).\n\nEdit: The 50k isn't on LUV, it's overall. Also-someone hacked my account and stole 18,000 southwest points from me, so I'm very bitter. Scared to call them and wait 2 hours on the phone. At least the person had the decency to book to vegas so they can gamble.\n\nEdit 2: Gainz  [https://imgur.com/a/yiL77iY](https://imgur.com/a/yiL77iY) \n\nPosition:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xdl2lyjl7gn41.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=28d9e5336c867bbeba93c4b2ddf76b1116fa06eb", "created_utc": 1584544919.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkr7h7/luv_dd_ive_made_turned_3k_into_51k_in_a_month/", "is_self": true}
