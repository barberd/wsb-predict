Take a look at the google 6 month graph. Each of these companies had a v shaped or swoosh (like nike swoosh) recovery. All the option chains havent picked up with it yet though.  Then compare it to the 6 month chart for a cruiseline, casino, or hotel stock. All the travel and leisure stocks have been trading flat the past month.\n\nTake fb for example. You can still pick up 2021 otm calls for under .7. Those bad boys have been creeping up from .2 and would have been priced at 4 to 6 a contract before the beer virus.
