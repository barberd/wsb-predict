{"id": "bum65c", "title": "Short Term Bullish", "selftext": "  \n\nWhile I maintain my long term bearish view, I have found some compelling data to suggest that there is some possible short term upside in the market. \n\n1. [https://imgur.com/a/eub7tPi](https://imgur.com/a/eub7tPi) The first piece of data set I am watching is the CBOE SKEW index. SKEW tracks the slope of the implied volatility curve of OTM SPX puts. Essentially it tracks the demand for protection of black swan events or tail risk hedges. Right now this index is insanely low. In the past 8 years, the index has only been this low twice, October 15 2014, and January 3rd 2019. After the first occurrence, SPY rallied more than 10% in the next 30 days and we all know what happened after January 3rd. Right now the larger players that trade SPX contracts are demanding very low amounts of downside protection.\n\n2. [https://imgur.com/a/Yzel8Eg](https://imgur.com/a/Yzel8Eg) Next is the VIX Call/Put ratio. The 10 period moving average of the VIX C/P ratio is noticeably low and has been one of my favorite leading indicators. On may 3rd 2019 I made a comment expressing my concerns that the VIX Call/Put ratio was extremely high and that we should expect some volatility in the markets.

Needless to say that worked out pretty well. The setup isn\u2019t as beautiful as it was then, but definitely shaping up for a short term rally.\n\n3.

If you are curious about these specific indices I would recommend reading their white paper.\n\n4. [https://imgur.com/a/ws7XXyS](https://imgur.com/a/ws7XXyS) From a TA perspective almost all of the 2 hour, 4 hour, and daily charts for SPY, IWM, and QQQ  are all showing bullish divergence on the RSI, Momentum, and PPO. This is a more subjective view so do with that what you will\n\n5. [https://imgur.com/a/JwPL0xQ](https://imgur.com/a/JwPL0xQ) Lastly, my own model that utilizes LSTM neural networks to forecast the SPY closing prices predicted the slump we have seen the past two days and is predicting a rally closing out this week and into the next. I use the past 23 years of Closing price, RSI, and Momentum and If you are curious about the model check my comment history for information and back tests. \n\nWith some important economic data coming out tomorrow the extremely near term outlook is unpredictable so take that into account. If GDP comes out tomorrow and it is absolute shit, then buying the dip might not be prudent. That being said, the data I am looking at point to a nice tradeable rally over the next one to two weeks. Right now I am in 6/7 282 SPY calls I bought this afternoon and will hold unless the divergence on the 4 hour chart for SPY breaks.", "created_utc": 1559174068, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bum65c/short_term_bullish/", "is_self": true}
