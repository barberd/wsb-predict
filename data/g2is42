Then I realized how they\u2019re gonna exceed EPS on Wednesday. Elon has figured out how to power fed printers with his batteries. This has enabled JPow to spin his printers faster than ever before. Here\u2019s the biggest part, there\u2019s no brrr now due to the quiet batteries\u2122\ufe0f. Investors aren\u2019t scared because they can\u2019t hear the printers when they put their ears to the door, so they stampede off like bulls to buy more calls. Therefore, SPY goes up too. You have all been thanking the wrong person. It\u2019s Elon we love, not JPow. So, thank you Elon for wrecking my account. You have beat the \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b out of me. \n\nTSLA 1000c 6/19\n\nSPY 1000c 6/19\n\nElon 1000c 6/19\n\nJPow 500p 6/19", "created_utc": 1587056277.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2is42/tsla_powering_printers/", "is_self": true}
