Anyway, EVH is in the prime opportunity to MOON. previous price before it crashed was 28 bucks, and it\u2019s now less than 9. however, it\u2019s been rising for the last week or so, and steadily so.\n\nNow that you know the context, here\u2019s why you should buy. Part of the reason EVH crashed is Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin banning it. Dude was a solid retard, most hated governor ever ( I\u2019m a kentuckian ) and wouldn\u2019t let them operate in KY, yaddayaddayadda. Well that motherfucker just got BOOTED out of office! AND THE NEW ONE SAID EVH IS CLEAR. Stock responded well to this today, but i believe it can go higher and higher. \n\nI recommend $10c in late january or early february\npersonally i own 75 shares of the stock", "created_utc": 1576014331, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e8xa6y/evh_dd/", "is_self": true}
