That's about 22% of the price you paid for the stock.  All sorts of reasons not to do this, bankruptcy looming and all.\n\nHowever, there have to be other companies not worthy on investing in that have options situations like this.  Trying to figure out a way to search for something like:\n\n* DTE <10\n* Option price as a percent of stock price > 15%\n   * That option being as close to ATM as possible\n* Significant volume/OI to make it a trade that will actually happen.\n\nThe DTE part is easy.  Finding the option is tricky -- it's a function (or correlated to IV), but finding those that are ATM (as opposed to way OTM or ITM).  I can find all sorts of ACB with crazy high IV, but I don't need a $40 put on ACB.  I want something that has the potential to narrowly miss assignment, but I'd be okay with assignment as well.  These also have the potential for the stock to tank. \n\nCouple weeks back I bought HTZ at $3.51, sold $3.50 calls at $0.91 then watch the stock swing between $2.70 and $3.60 for the week.  Was able to get out for $3.13 the next Monday.  ended up making 15% on the whole mess over 7 days.\n\nI haven't figured out how to screen for these yet with TOS or any of the other screeners I tried.
