Been practicing my trade strategies on TOS and want to play safer vertical call spreads with my extra cash laying around in my RH portfolio. I have normal options trading but it won\u2019t approve me for spreads because I\u2019ve never done any live trading on RH yet, I just hold stocks as of right now....is there a way to bypass this by just doing manual multi leg positions and closing out one at a time? What are the risks involved in trying this? Like getting assigned on something. I have about 3100 in stocks and an extra few hundred in cash. Should I just forget about it and switch to TOS instead? Can I contact RH support and see if they can upgrade me?\n\nAny help would be appreciated.", "created_utc": 1554991487, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bc09pn/vertical_call_spreads_wo_rh_lvl_3_options_possible/", "is_self": true}
