{"id": "feosk3", "title": "PRPL vs CSPR DD for Monday afternoon earnings.", "selftext": "First of all- This is real autistic due diligence. PRPL currently doesn't have options available so this is strictly a stock play. There are some public traded warrants that you can look into to maximize gains but this DD is purely for stock. Casper also doesn't have options available for trade and I am not aware of any publicly traded warrants.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7m1f85zpx5l41.png?width=1618&format=png&auto=webp&s=24cdbb48460482725badb77f112f5f98dcb5c46a\n\n* CSPR just recently IPO'd with an initial price of \\~14 dollars per share.\n* Their valuation cratered from 1.1B to less than 600M prior to their IPO.\n* As of right now CSPR is trading at less than 10 dollars and a valuation of less than 400M\n* Casper has never made a profit and has lost more than 300M dollars over the last 5-6 years.\n   * Casper serves more countries than PRPL and PRPL is now growing faster.\n* &#x200B;\n* CSPR subs their manufacturing to another company.\n* CSPR currently loses money on every mattress even though their gross margin is 50%+\n* CSPR will likely not be profitable for 18+ months.\n* CSPR has chosen to partner with target and open their own stores. Currently they have opened 60+ stores.\n   * &#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4nnkl35qw5l41.png?width=1452&format=png&auto=webp&s=82b4961f99d750dabdba6a0c56ba362c56651d35\n\nPurple is due to release earnings @ 4:30 Eastern on Monday, March 9th. The following items are DD that I have been doing over the course of the last 2 years.\n\n* Purple has been vastly under the radar as it went public through a reverse merger. At the time of the merger PRPL had just completed their second full year of business and they had net sales of 188M.\n* In purple's third year, they grew sales to 284M.\n* In 2019 (PRPL's 4th year) the company has projected sales of \\~400-425M. They report earnings on Monday.\n* Prpl has drastically improved their wholesale business.\n   * in 2018 Wholesale revenue was less than 25% of their sales.\n   * in 2019, Wholesale revenue is approaching 45% of their business in the latest quarter.\n   * At the end of 2019 purple was in approximately 1400 wholesale locations and had 5 mattress Max machines.\n   * See S-3 filing date below. Average selling price for a mattress is almost 1800.00 dollars.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eu9310azu5l41.png?width=1558&format=png&auto=webp&s=23b0041a3982c029edc136db81f7c5fc18c979f4\n\nThe CEO has recently made comments that in 2020, PRPL anticipates bringing on 4 more machines and improving operations to double capacity.\n\n* See link and watch from about 4:30 onward.\n* [https://www.nasdaq.com/videos/silicon-slopes%3A-joe-megibow-ceo-purple](https://www.nasdaq.com/videos/silicon-slopes%3A-joe-megibow-ceo-purple)\n* These machines lead me to believe PRPL might provide guidance of 650-700M which would be 40%+ growth.\n* PRPL's gross margin in Q3 was 45%\n* PRPL just released a new Harmony pillow.\n* PRPL has barely started penetrating the mattress market (Insert Mom joke here)\n* there are \\~30,000 furniture stores in the USA, PRPL is in less than 3% with ample room to grow.\n* TL;DR\n* Buy PRPL, wait for CSPR to turn profitable.", "created_utc": 1583548719.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/feosk3/prpl_vs_cspr_dd_for_monday_afternoon_earnings/", "is_self": true}
