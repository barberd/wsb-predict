{"id": "cw7995", "title": "Options Market 8-27-19", "selftext": " S*ource: Schwab Center for Financial Research*\n\n**Today\u2019s Bullish Activity**\n\nShares of Dow-component **Johnson &amp; Johnson Inc. (JNJ + $2.30 to $130.10)** are gapping up following news that an Oklahoma judge ruled that the healthcare giant must pay $572M for its part in fueling the U.S. opioid epidemic. The stock is moving higher as the fine was significantly lower than the $17B the Oklahoma Attorney General had been seeking to help pay for addiction treatment and prevention programs. Evercore ISI said fine expectations were between $500M and $5B with the consensus estimate around $1B. Puts are outnumbering calls nearly 2:1 with the September 20th 130.00 put being the most actively traded contract (volume is 6,774).\n\nAlso trading to the upside is **Caleres Inc. (CAL + $3.84 to $19.08)** after the footwear maker reported Q2 earnings of $0.62 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.04 beat) on revenue that increased 6.5% year-over-year to $752.5M (roughly in-line with the $752.2M consensus estimate). Brand portfolio sales increased 17.9% year-over-year to $359.6M while total Famous Footwear sales were $419.8M on same-store sales that increased 1.5%. Call volume is dominating (\\~7:1 over puts) which is primarily being driven by activity on the September 20th 15.00 call (volume is 3,115).\n\nLastly, **Altria Group Inc. (MO + $3.99 to $51.11)** is moving higher on news that the company is in discussions with **Phillip Morris International Inc. (PM - $4.44 to $73.29)**regarding a potential all-stock merger of equals. MO calls are outnumbering puts roughly 5:3 with the September 20th 50.00 call being the most actively traded contract (volume is 9,090). PM puts are outnumbering calls better than 2:1 with the September 20th 75.00 put seeing the most action from traders (volume is 3,983). PM average implied volatility is up to a year-to-date high of 36% this morning. *Note: the average implied volatility represents an estimated value for a 30-day implied volatility at the current underlying price, based on a curve fit of option implied volatilities.* \n\nNew 52-week highs (39 new highs today): **Agree Realty Corp. (ADC + $0.55 to $73.85),** **Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd. (AEM + $0.44 to $62.60), Idacorp Corp. (IDA + $0.70 to $109.71), Roku Inc. (ROKU + $2.59 to $145.60)**\n\n**Notable Call Activity**\n\nSome unusual call activity (\\~50:1 over puts) is coming up on the radar on **Cloudera Inc. (CLDR + $0.02 to $8.85)** which is primarily being driven by activity on the September 20th 7.50 call. Volume on this contract is 9,966 (vs. open interest of 13,376) which mostly consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought at various times for between $0.48 and $0.50 each.\n\n**Yelp Inc. (YELP + $0.65 to $32.68):** Calls are outnumbering puts roughly 20:1 as option traders primarily target two contracts that expire at the end of this week (August 30th):\n\n* 33.00 call (volume is 7,885 vs. open interest of 125): Transactions on this contract mostly consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought at various times for $0.56.\n* 32.50 call (volume is 3,588 vs. open interest of 56): Transactions on this contract mostly consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought at various times for between $0.71-0.86.\n\nWe know that the volume on both of these contracts represents new positioning based on the open interest figures and the bulk of the activity appears to be bullish in nature.\n\n**Today\u2019s Bearish Activity**\u00a0\n\nMoving lower this morning is **J.M. Smucker Co. (SJM - $10.17 to $102.76)** after the branded pet, consumer foods and coffee company reported fiscal Q1 earnings of $1.57 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.18 miss) on revenue that fell 6.5% year-over-year to $1.78B (below the $1.88B expected). Commenting on the quarter, CEO Mark Smucker stated, \u201cOur first quarter performance fell short of expectations primarily due to the timing of shipments and deflationary pricing in the coffee and peanut butter categories, as well as competitive activity in the premium dog food category\u201d. Additionally, the company lowered full-year 2020 EPS guidance to $8.35-8.55 (from $8.45-8.65) on revenue that is expected to be \u201cdown 1% to flat\u201d (from a prior view of \u201cup more than 2%\u201d). Puts are outnumbering calls nearly 2:1 with the September 20th 100.00 put topping the most actives list (volume is 1,307).\u00a0\n\nAlso trading to the downside is **Anaplan Inc. (PLAN - $2.86 to $56.49)** even though the maker of cloud-based planning software beat quarterly estimates and provided upbeat guidance earlier this morning. Anaplan reported a Q2 loss of $0.12 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.04 beat) on revenue that increased 46.2% year-over-year to $84.5M (above the $78.25M). Looking ahead, the company guided Q3 revenue to a range of $85.5-86.5M (vs. the $83.49M consensus estimate) and raised full-year 2020 revenue guidance to a range of $339-343M (from $326-331M). Calls are outnumbering puts better than 2:1 with the September 20th 60.00 call garnering the most attention from traders (volume is 1,289).\n\nNew 52-week lows (274 new lows today): **American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL - $0.16 to $25.03), Credicorp Ltd. (BAP + $1.44 to $202.22), Footlocker Inc. (FL - $0.34 to $35.35), Halliburton Co. (HAL + $0.18 to $17.68), Macy\u2019s Inc. (M - $0.05 to $14.66)**\n\n**Notable Put Activity**\n\nSome unusual put activity (nearly 4:1 over calls) is being seen in **Hewlett Packard Enterprises Inc. (HPE + $0.04 to $12.98)** which is primarily being driven by activity on the August 30th 12.50 put. Volume on this contract is 15,566 (vs. open interest of 1,151), which nearly entirely consisted of a 15K block that was bought at the ask price of $0.18. We know this block is a new position based on the open interest figure and we can assume that the intent is bearish in nature since the trade took place at the ask price.\n\n**Volume Signals** \n\nShares of the **iShares Silver Trust ETF (SLV + $0.42 to $16.94)** are pushing up to a nearly a two-year high this morning and six out of the top ten most actively traded option contracts across the market today are coming from this ETF. The top two most actively traded option contracts across the board today are the SLV October 18th 17.00 call (volume is 62,171 vs. open interest of 83,674) and the SLV January 2020 16.00 call (volume is 49,211 vs. open interest of 123,876).\n\n**Chubb Ltd. (CB + $0.35 to $155.56):** Option volume is running at over 20x the daily average of 144 contracts which is primarily being driven by a couple of blocks that simultaneously traded on the September 20th expiration:\n\n* 150.00 put \u2013 a 1,000 block traded for $1.40, directly in the middle of the $1.35 x $1.45 bid/ask spread (open interest of 210)\n* 140.00 put \u2013 a 1,000 block was sold for $0.35 (open interest of 49)\n\nWe know these blocks are new positions and it appears that a $10.00-wide bear put spread was established for a net debit of $1.05 which suggests that the block trader believes that CB will close below the break-even price of $148.95 at expiration.\n\n**Planet Fitness Inc. (PLNT + $1.12 to $69.49):** Option volume is running at over 5.5x the daily average of 904 contracts which is primarily being driven by activity on the September 20th 70.00 call. Volume on this contract is 3,160 (vs. open interest of 1,858) which mostly consisted of various sized blocks that were being bought for between $1.85-2.00, including a 1,064 block that was bought at the ask price of $1.85. Shares of PLNT have been in a downtrend for most of August but are exhibiting some relative strength today and appear to have found some technical support at the 200-day SMA over the past week.\n\n**Gauging Volatility**\n\nThe **CBOE Volatility Index (VIX + 0.44 to 19.76)** has been on both sides of the unchanged line this morning (intraday range is 18.49-20.35) as equity markets are mixed around the mid-day mark today (DJI + 7, SPX + 2, COMPX - 3). VIX option volume has been below average today at 209,991 contracts (#5 on the top 10 most actives list) and the activity has been call-biased (the volume put/call ratio is currently 0.44). The most actively traded contract is the September 18th 21.00 call as volume is 40,615 versus open interest of 154,710.", "created_utc": 1566925228, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cw7995/options_market_82719/", "is_self": true}
