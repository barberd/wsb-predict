He's like Hank Hill as in propane is his fucking life but he's actually smart. \n\nDisclaimer: I've only been at my job for 6 months so I still have a lot to learn. I'm retarded like many of you here but I was also baked on said call where actual important insight was being shared so I may slightly be remembering what he said wrong. \n\nAnyways, paraphrasing here, he said there will be a shortage of propane in the US because of Canada cutting their exports. He predicts that the opposite of what we're seeing with oil is going to happen to propane here by July.\n\nSuppliers of residential and commercial propane from fuel delivery companies are going to be impacted. \n\nThink about how many homes in the sticks use propane for fucking everything from heating, cooking, drying clothes, fireplaces, etc. Fleet vehicles from government and law enforcement use autogas propane. Same with UPS. Forklifts use propane cylinders. Farms use this shit to dry crops. \n\nI wonder if this could pump tanker companies even more, especially with $NAT mooning after the presser on NBC. I saw other ones like $TNP and $GLOP that looked attractive too. \n\nThis is the most recent article I found about the propane shortage in Canada from one of our industry magazines: https://bpnews.com/index.php/publications/magazine/archive/2294-canadian-rail-blockades-result-in-propane-and-goods-shortages\n\nCan any Canadians chime in on this? Is this still an issue and is it made worse because of COVID?\n\nTL;DR: Apparently there will be a shortage of propane in the US. I don't know what plays I'm making yet because I'm retarded but figured it might be worth looking into from someone who isn't as retarded as me.\n\nEDIT: Nice government website I found with colored lines and numbers about propane supply/demand https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/weekly/propane.php", "created_utc": 1587793286.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7oc9r/i_think_there_are_some_plays_out_there_to_be_made/", "is_self": true}
