{"id": "fitcwm", "title": "Frontline Diary: COVID 19 in Europe", "selftext": "Hey Guys.\n\nShit is about to get real in Europe, people only started taking this seriously today. \n\n***What is to be expected:***\n\nMassive exponential growth of cases in the next weeks (peak expected for 2nd or 3rd week of April)\n\nLots of companies already planning layoffs, some already started\n\nA massive amount of corporations (Huge, listed companies from sectors such as banking and insurance) do not have enough laptops or I.T. staff to setup remote work for most workers. There is not enough stock of laptops and suppliers are **filled to the brink** with orders from multinationals.\n\nSupermarkets are now starting to run dry and limitations of items per person should come in soon (not lack of supply, just overblown demand)\n\nThere is already a bunch of groups developing DIY ventilators for both hospital and private utilisation. Veterinarian ventilators + army equipment + private healthcare have been requested (not yet by law) to be made available for  public hospitals. (If you have technical knowledge please join @ [https://panvent.blogspot.com](https://panvent.blogspot.com) ).\n\nArmy Labs are now producing both test kits and pharmaceutical supplies.\n\nOur strategic reserves are already being tapped into.\n\nThe USA will face **severe difficulties** dealing with this being that no meaningful measures have been taken and they will take quite awhile to be effective (just look at Italy and they are not at peak yet)\n\nTLDR:\n\nBuy puts. Buy some food (responsibly), isolate as much as possible from high-risk persons (including your family) and make sure your circle of friends and family understand the seriousness of the matter and what it will cause in hospitals (anarchy, basically).", "created_utc": 1584235222.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fitcwm/frontline_diary_covid_19_in_europe/", "is_self": true}
