Stitch Fix is currently in an ascending channel, and has broken past both a descending resistance level at $26 and horizontal resistance at $28. The stock has a short float of 45.04%, and it is likely that most bears entered their short positions at the last time the stock was at $28. I know for a fact bears have strong hands, but I also know that I'd be crapping myself if I didn't cash out and now somehow am back where I started shorting. This fear could be compounded by 2 future catalysts: 1. this post and the wsb affect, 2. earnings coming up soon. We are close to a short squeeze, just need you fellas to do what you do. Forgot to mention this stock has had increasing bull volume for 6 days. **Also had to remove certain words so the post wouldn't get removed.** \n\n[Chart for anybody who is a visual learner \\(special\\)](https://preview.redd.it/eu9yanld6ei41.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9483fd39ada07469162bf9ed2dd918dc0e08fc4)\n\nNow for the fundementals:\n\nI still don't know what this company does. Something to do with clothes. \n\nWhat options to buy?Calls for $32 or up, depends how ballsy you are.
