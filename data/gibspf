Their Q1 2020 ER was on May 7, and in the weeks trading up to it was high as $12 and on May 6 it was $9.6\n\nWith the May 7 ER they announced a dividend of $1.10 (0.29 for Q4 2019 + 0.81 for Q1 2020) due to monstrous Q1 2020 (about as much as the entirety of 2019). The dividend record date is May 29 and June 16 (for Q4 and Q1).\n\n*Why* has the stock traded flat compared to the day before earnings?  Assuming the market values EURN at $10, should it be rising to about $11 for the expected dividend(s)?\n\nI don't think a massive beat / dividends was priced in either because they **beat EPS estimates by like 40%**.  I'm trying to wrap my mind around this but it just doesn't add up.  As things stand right now, if the market does value EURN at $10 then just holding the stock for 5 weeks guarantees a 10% return\n\nQ2 is supposed to be insane too because\n\n>So far in the second quarter of 2020, the Euronav VLCC fleet operated in the Tankers International Pool has earned about USD 95,000 per day and 71% of the available days have been fixed. Euronav\u2019s Suezmax fleet trading on the spot market has earned about USD 65,400 per day on average with 57% of the available days fixed.\n\nEdit: https://www.tradewindsnews.com/finance/deutsche-bank-prods-euronav-to-drop-dividend-perhaps-listing/2-1-806806\n\n>The world's largest crude-tanker owner is getting no credit for paying a big shareholder dividend and arguably none for being a public company,", "created_utc": 1589292170.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gibspf/eurn_shouldnt_the_stock_rise_to_account_for_the/", "is_self": true}
