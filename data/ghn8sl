{"id": "ghn8sl", "title": "WIX Breakout and (Pre) Earnings Play", "selftext": "I'm going to keep this brief. Wix is a company that allows you to easily make websites (think of something like Shopify but less enterprise/e-commerce focused and more targeted towards SMBs that simply want online presence). With the advent of the coronavirus has come much pain to small businesses and the like. What do they do to survive? Make websites.\n\nNow, WIX recently hit an all-time high this week. It recently indicated that Q1 results will meet previous guidance (which means there is a high chance it exceeds guidance). Analysts and the stock market websites you shouldn't listen to (but that you can use to your advantage) almost universally expect WIX to beat expectations. Fundamentally, WIX is very good. It has a strong niche, strong revenue growth, much-better-than-competitors margins, and is valued at significant discount to some of its peers that have run up recently. WIX also easily meets the \"famed\" Rule of 40. For small and medium businesses that want an online presence right now, it has Shopify beat for cost and flexibility (especially non e-commerce businesses).\n\nSo WIX is well poised to take advantage of the paradigm shift to online (because of our dear friend 'Rona). See Google Trends.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oiqe4pqqw4y41.png?width=1380&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e351e985c0a6a9deddfbbdfba2128bc940b8025\n\nBut regardless of fundamentals, the play I am advocating for is quite simple: take advantage of the fact that the big boys know most of what I have said already, and also that WIX is relatively less followed, and play the run up to earnings. Another factor that will work in your favor is that when the price of WIX moves, its option prices *really* move (I believe 3x on Friday, close to 10x since Wed). I'm playing the 5/15 $170c.\n\nTLDR: Play the WIX run-up to earnings and the fact people expect it to beat; buy the 5/15 $170c (or 6/19 if you're not totally crazy) and sell before earnings.\n\nIf you want I can do more fundamental-type analysis for WIX and analyze whether holding through earnings makes sense.", "created_utc": 1589202612.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghn8sl/wix_breakout_and_pre_earnings_play/", "is_self": true}
