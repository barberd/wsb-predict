{"id": "cfrco4", "title": "Don't let your Dreams be Dreams", "selftext": "This tale is for all of you out there who keep losing money and just don't know why (the whole sub). It's been tough to see all these red Robinhood screenshots and final goodbyes covering the front page...\n\nJust one year ago, this was me:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8d8qmv/any_good_comeback_stories_i_need_some_inspiration/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link\n\nA clueless idiot trading 100 times a week (options) while watching my money evaporate through my phone. Why was this happening to me? I was smart. I followed the market every day. I had good ideas and did thorough DD. Sure, sometimes I traded emotionally, and maybe I was a little too active and short-sighted with my moves, but I was certain that'd get better with experience. \n\nThankfully I have a good job, so I was able to reload and try again (post-screenshot). This time was different - to a point. I started with stocks only. I weathered the great dip through the winter last year, and started approaching net positive on the bounce. It wasn't long until I got greedy, the lust for options returned. I really busted out on the market recovery, made back my losses, then LOST it all again after being 100% options on SONO earnings (they beat big over the holidays, but the CFO quit...). Now here I was again, shouldering massive losses and feeling like an even bigger idiot than before. I made great calls. I rode Sonos from 9.50 to 13.00, and Square from 55 to 78, and I FUCKING LOST MONEY. How could I ruin months of gains in one stupid day?\n\nI continued on, half heartedly at first, but I was not going to give up. Work sucks. I don't want to retire at fucking 65 with one foot in the grave. I don't want to live my whole life completely dependent on a 9-5 working for necessity when I don't actually give a shit. I don't want to keep my money in a bank, getting a measly 2% kickback while they invest and loan out MY money.\n\nSo unlike the faggots here ready to off themselves at any inconvenience, I got real with myself, asked some big questions, and made an important change. Here's a screenshot of my account (TastyWorks) from Friday:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/mIR9gvT\n\nI am still largely retarded as you can see by my positions, but even so I am net positive and trading better than I ever have before. If you care and want to know what I changed, here it is. I think it could help most of the newbies on this sub:\n\nMy first plan of action was to ditch Robinhood. Robinhood is investing cancer. Firstly, it is intentionally designed to support emotional investing. You log in and the first page is a giant graph of your P/L for the day. You see +100% and a big green line blasting up and your little autistic heart feels a rush it never felt before. Then the day comes when you see a big red line blasting down at -20%, and you feel like King Leonidas crumbling in front of the fucking Persians. You trade to ride this rollercoaster and any logic dies the second those green numbers roll up or those red numbers roll down. Maybe you have a plan, some catalyst you're waiting for, but hey, you have buying power now, why not put it to use? No, that's stupid, but wait till 2:00pm hits at work and you're bored as fuck and, look, Tesla is down 3%, so it should probably go back up, it's Friday, that makes sense, and BOOM you lose another 500 bucks just because you're fucking bored. All it took was a couple taps and a swipe on your phone to ruin any investment plan you had. If you want to get serious, you absolutely HAVE to move your trading to a browser or desktop, use a platform that provides real information and trade analysis, and take the potential to impulse trade out of your god damn pocket. I could go on and on about how Robinhood sucks (margin rules are retarded, order execution is retarded, interface is retarded, etc) but just switch for a couple weeks and you'll learn on your own. This post is already becoming a novel.\n\nAnother obvious issue was stock options. Are they useful? Sure. Should someone trade options so frequently that they begin to blame the PDT rule for massive losses? Absolutely not. I broke out of my options addiction by asking a simple question: If I had a 500k account, would I still buy options? The answer for me was no. I knew deep down that options were not a safe or reliable trading strategy, and options trading for me was driven by greed, not by my best judgement. I mean, How could they be reliable? What could I really expect from options trading? That one day I would be good enough to get a 300% gainer every week and never lose? That I could keep the streak going even in a bear market (something I've never experienced) or survive a huge crash? If this was possible, professional traders would become fucking quintillionaires in no time. I had to get real about what I wanted out of trading, and that was to build long term wealth and retire early. During my very best runs, options trading could only make my account into an unreliable source of income and nothing else.\n\nMain issues out of the way, here's few common things people say and do on here that I used to eat up, but now it makes me gag:\n\n1. \"Ehhh the PDT rule stole my gains\" - this is easy, if you daytrade using Robinhood you're as clueless as a fucking penguin in the Sahara. There are simply never 3 day trades in a week that are worth the fucking risk. The amount of DD and sound logic you can fit into a day trade is fucking nothing without trading metrics that 99% of this sub (me included) will never learn or access (guess what, they're not on Robinhood). You have to trade seeing potential at least a month out.\n\n2. \"I/YoU can MaKe 1,500 A wEEk\" - anyone suggesting you can get regular returns on a weekly basis is fucking retarded. These people are either the dumbest people on the planet or they are trying to trick you.\n\n3. \"Earnings time. Calls or puts?\" - How about neither? This is a gamble every time, and the most likely outcome is that your options lose because of the high IV premium you paid for it, even if you get the direction right. Earning's run-ups can be reliable for stock purchases, but only bought like a month out. The report is a gamble, every time.\n\nWell that's that, I'm tired of writing and you stopped reading anyways.\n\nTLDR: Delete Robinhood, stop being impulsive, buy stock (not options) on defensible DD, trade to maintain and build capital instead of for income.
