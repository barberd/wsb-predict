I believe it will recover once this virus is over. Regardless of the legitimacy of Chinese business books, once they start production they will be the next big thing in China since the CCP will subsidize the shit out of them to reduce air pollution in major cities. That, and their only other competitor is Tesla... which is way too expensive for Chinese citizens, even for their middle class. \n\nGet your LEAPS ready boys. \n\nATM 2021 is going for 1.6, and the $10 strike is going for .53 with a delta of .32.\n\nATM 2022 is going for 1.95, and the $10 strike is going for .97 with a delta of .47.\n\nWait till the Coronavirus is past us, Chinese market stabilizes, and be the first one in to get your LEAP. This will be either the easiest money you will ever make, or the least money you will ever lose. \n\nTldr; NIO LEAPS. Not today. Nor tomorrow. Nor next week. But someday.", "created_utc": 1580684338, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/exx03s/nio_leaps_nio_leaps_nio_leaps/", "is_self": true}
