Results from SARS 2003 trials were grim.\n\n\u201cThese SARS-CoV vaccines all induced antibody and protection against infection with SARS-CoV. However, challenge of mice given any of the vaccines led to occurrence of Th2-type immunopathology suggesting hypersensitivity to SARS-CoV components was induced. Caution in proceeding to application of a SARS-CoV vaccine in humans is indicated.\u201d\n\n***DEADLY FAILURE***\n\n[SARS 2003 Vaccine Candidate Results](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3335060/)\n\n2. We have never successfully vaccinated against a corona virus. COVID-2019 is a highly transmittable diseases while its little brother SARS 2003 was easy to contain.\n \n\u201cWith SARS, most human-to-human infections occurred in health care settings that lacked robust infection control procedures. When infection control practices were implemented, the outbreak ended. Since then, the only occurrences have occurred through laboratory accidents. They have not spread throughout the community.\n\nCOVID-19 appears to spread person-to-person, through droplets that are expelled when a person coughs or sneezes and then are inhaled by a nearby person. Less often, it may be spread by touching an infected surface and then touching one\u2019s mouth, nose, or eyes. Transmission may also occur before a person becomes symptomatic\u201d\n\n[SARS 2003 v COVID-19 Comparison](https://www.biospace.com/article/comparison-2003-sars-pandemic-vs-2020-covid-19-pandemic/)\n\nNow you may be thinking? Market is mooning shut the fuck up. Hey, can\u2019t fight the trend I personally will ride the momentum...just remember this is short sided thinking...the FED has never lost a battle yet. It also has never had an adversary quite like this; COVID-19 having the ability to permanently alter society and reduce economic productivity for a VERY long period of time. Florida reopens, more states to follow...and TRUMP has put us in the perfect spot to go through another shock and awe period.  Remember by no means think this is a short term play, ride the FED pump and bullish euphoria up to its highest levels. The second you start seeing headlines and hints of a second wave you put everything you have into shorting everything that requires a face to face interaction or a grouping of people (hotels, restaurants, retail, leasure, etc). Amazon and the digital market players will fucking MOON.\n\nNow Playing : Future - Mask Off\n\nHerp. Derp. Probably lots of typos I\u2019m not fixing them. The virus can\u2019t be vaccinated against and it\u2019s much more transmittable than anything we have dealt with before. Long term impacts not showing yet.\n\nBears remember this acronym it will be used a lot : AED \u201cantibody dependent enhancement\u201d google it \ud83d\ude01", "created_utc": 1587262524.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g3zs1w/sars_2003_vaccine_failures_covid19_parallels/", "is_self": true}
