{"id": "gkcjxf", "title": "JCP UPDATE", "selftext": "This is a follow up post to [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/giinff/10\\_million\\_shares\\_in\\_20\\_minutes/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/giinff/10_million_shares_in_20_minutes/) . The day after that post JCP spiked more than 50% and today it spiked 50% again with just news of a possible bankruptcy... Ive sold at the top my calls twice because it drops off in minutes. Anyways, today the news was that JCP made its interest payment, to buy some time for its bankruptcy. This means they could go another few days or a whole month more before officially filing. Im getting out of JCP assuming they dont go through with it for a few days or their loan application is denied and they go to CHAP 7 instead of CHAP 11 meaning the stock would go to 0 real quick. Im just writing this to give a heads up to others that have more balls than me that want to bet on JCP actually getting CHAP 11 and the loan approved which would make the stock spike 50% at least (Cant predict how high). If you buy 0.5 6/19C and they go CHAP 11 you will hit the jackpot, I already called 2 spikes so I dont want to play with fire anymore... Godspeed autists!
