BAD NEWS PUMPS STONKS. $BA carries the Dow, Jerome has no choice but to pump.\n\n$BA is playing a support game right now, it bounced super strong support, I knew this was going to happen. \n\nRefer [to my post from yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h15zss/please_stay_safe_ba_call_holders/) when $BA was down -20% and I assured you autists it was gonna spring back up and its just a dip, glad i tripled down, because I came out in profit today, and $BA ain't done moving to the upside. \n\nThe volume is fucking insane on the daily chart, I'm talking all time high levels. This Boeing 737 Max crash bullshit \"news\" is a fucking retard put trap. News isn't going to stop this momentum. Don't get duped into selling your calls this is a guaranteed pump.\n\nYou fucking retard zoomers think its a reversal after a straight month of green and few days of red, so im inversing you retarted zoomers, THIS IS A RETRACE NOT A REVERSAL.\n\n*Side note(Serious): I talked to my functioning autistic friend today, i found out he has 800$ in robinhood. he has 1x ACB 9.5c 6/19. I explained theta to him so hopefully he can make some tendies and not get shafted.*", "created_utc": 1592007445.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h7wlkr/stop_saying_ba_calls_are_fucked/", "is_self": true}
