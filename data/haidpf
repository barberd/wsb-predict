{"id": "haidpf", "title": "The Prophecy of Demolition Man -- DD on YUM via Prophecy Method", "selftext": "For those of you who didn't see it, Demolition Man is a prophetic movie from 1993. In it, Sylvester Stallone (as a super cop) and Wesley Snipes (as a super criminal) are cryogenically frozen in 1996, and emerge in 2032 Los Angeles, which is completely unprepared for Snipes' wave of terror.\n\nThings have changed in 2032 (relative to 1996, which is where the beginning is set), and this is where this post becomes DD via Prophecy.\n\n\\- Society has become extremely polite and politically correct, to the point where people are constantly falling over themselves to avoid causing offense, and check for problematic content in every word they speak, engaging in drastic self-censorship, and pearl-clutching at the slightest error. CHECK. We are on course.\n\n\\- The police are basically abolished, and are largely demilitarized. CHECK. LA is doing that right now, and just defunded their police dept significantly. They even just gave up their grenade launchers and tanks!!!\n\n\\- No one gets laid EVER. CHECK. COVID is doing this for everyone, not just those who never got laid in the pre-COVID world.\n\n\\- Los Angeles has a chronic underclass that is ignored continually by the elites. CHECK. Nothing changed there.\n\n\\- Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes are amazing action heroes. CHECK.\n\nNow, you are probably wondering, that sounds like a cool movie u/Unlucky-Prize, but why is this relevant to me making tendies, which is why I'm on WSB???\n\nBecause the movie also reveals that the only restaurant chain (or even restaurant) surviving is **Taco Bell,** after a gruesome period referred to as the \"Franchise Wars\".\n\nIt seems to me that this COVID-19 catalyst is what is going to cause the Franchise Wars, and Demolition Man has already declared the winner. The combined market cap of US restaurant stocks is currently somewhere between 500 billion and 1 trillion, depending upon if you count privately owned restaurants. With monopoly pricing power, this value goes up.  Conservatively, that would put Taco Bell at a 2 trillion dollar company.\n\nRight now, YUM Brands, the holding company of Taco Bell, is trading at $27b market cap with a stock price of $92. Even if they have to do some mergers to get there, so let's assume 4x dilution, that's still a 20x upside to get to the 2 trillion dollar market cap.\n\nI think we are in the first stages of the \"Franchise Wars\", so I'm looking at J**anuary 21, 2022 LEAPS at a strike of $170, which I think you can purchase for about $0.70.** If we get even half way there, to a $1t market cap (with say 2x dilution on the way), that's a stock price increase of 20x, getting it from $92 up to $1840, which would be a **gain of 238,500%** over a 2 year period.\n\nIt literately can't go wrong. When you see the future clearly, it's the easiest game ever.", "created_utc": 1592361490.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/haidpf/the_prophecy_of_demolition_man_dd_on_yum_via/", "is_self": true}
