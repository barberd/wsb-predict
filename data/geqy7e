I just thought it was funny and would laugh at the misfortune of poor people. A few weeks ago I started trying to make some plays following the DD from popular posts. I went from being profitable AF, to now losing my portion completely earmarked for this experiment. Is it possible that people are selling inexpensive options and coming to this sub to try to pump them up and get autistists and general retards to hand over money? My main reason for thinking this is a certain option I held that would spike in value huge, when I would go to sell it it would tank in price . I cancelled and the stock went back up to a higher spot . Like it was easy to manipulate the value after posting to 1.2 million possible users plus all the lurkers. Let me know if this checks out . I just smoked the supreme so might just be high . Peace \n\nSpy 280 5/15", "created_utc": 1588794087.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/geqy7e/possible_securities_fraud/", "is_self": true}
