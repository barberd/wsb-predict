It\u2019s now at ~200.  Their LOWEST analyst target price is 248.  P/E ~20.\n\n\nhttps://www.benzinga.com/stock/Baba/ratings\n\nTheir projected EPS is ~20% lower than last year.  BABA has destroyed earnings every time for last 2 years. \n\nIf there is one thing I\u2019m certain of, it\u2019s that despite the lip service from trump, he will NOT start another major trade war right now.  Exactly zero percent chance.  He doesn\u2019t give a fuck if they started this virus, he just wants to be re-elected and place blame elsewhere.  He needs the economy as best it can be.  He\u2019ll talk tough but ultimately won\u2019t do anything until after election. \n\nThey have cloud computing and are the amazon of China.  But remember amazons earnings were so so because of 3-4 billion in covid related expenses protecting employees.  Chinese firms are not burdened by this sort of obligation.\n\nChina also reports no deaths (cough bullshit cough) in last 2-3 weeks from covid and are opening up the economy, but just like amazon this company should be thriving as an internet seller.  \n\nEven IF BABA hasn\u2019t done well, they\u2019d just fudge the numbers. You know, I know it. It\u2019s all just made up numbers. This is the only reason I see why they are trading at 200.  General skepticism about business practices and lack of familiarity with the company.\n\nI bought 30k in $210 calls for 5/29 yesterday. Already up to 42k.\n\nTheir earnings are 5/14, premarket\n\nAssuming they have a good run up before earnings, I will likely trim my position and hedge.  Im a fan of bull spreads when IV is super high to help negate IV crush around earnings. \n\nThoughts?\n\nI tried to get this in before market close today but decided to drink a beer instead.\n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/mTerKT9\n\nRe-Edit:   The earnings date is unclear. RH says 5/14.  Fidelity says 5/13.  Other sources saying 5/18 or 5/20.\n\nI cannot find a date on BABA\u2019s website.  So sometime in the next 2 weeks.  \n\nIf anybody sees official date published please post a link", "created_utc": 1588968982.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gg0q3u/why_is_nobody_talking_about_baba/", "is_self": true}
