{"id": "drz1ws", "title": "Short FB?", "selftext": "So Facebook [recently announced](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/11/introducing-our-new-company-brand/) that they are rebranding.\n\nImagine a company of that scale using such a bad picture for this announcement. Like the colour of the letters is almost the same as the guy's shirt and it makes the logo not stand out at all. But let's forget this minor detail in comparison, here's what their plan is: \n\n\"People should know which companies make the products they use. Our main services include the Facebook app, Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus, Workplace, Portal and Calibra.\"\n\n\"Over the coming weeks, we will start using the new brand within our products and marketing materials, including a new company website.\"\n\nHow delusional are they actually? Facebook is *lucky* that most of the users of Instagram and WhatsApp don't even have a clue that these services are ran by Facebook. Facebook is not cool anymore, it hasn't been in 10 years. Everyone knows that the \"boo\" in Facebook stands for \"boomer\". Some users of these services are also concerned about their data and it really won't help to remind them everytime they're using these services that all the data goes directly to Suckerberg. \n\nIt's actually in Facebook's interest that their customers are clueless and they're doing the exact opposite to keep it that way. This is a stupid move by Facebook and it shows that they're quite delusional about the public's perception of Facebook. Pretty bad move by FB imo.", "created_utc": 1572960056, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/drz1ws/short_fb/", "is_self": true}
