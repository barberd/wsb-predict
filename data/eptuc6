(Actual DD with charts)", "selftext": "Hey guys, this is Jim from Jim's Bulging Biceps Fitness Branded Water, and I'm here to talk to you today about how a recession is many years away.\n\nLet me introduce those of lesser knowledge among you to the Basic Bitch Becky Basic Business Cycle (most of you autists are very familiar, so this will be a quick recap).\n\nGrowth =&gt; Debt =&gt; Growth =&gt; Overspending =&gt; Inflation =&gt; Fed Acts to create recession\n\nOkay, now what's the second last part of that cycle? Inflation. Inflation always precedes a recession(After all, if there's no inflation, the fed can simply turn on the printing presses and create as much growth as it wants). In the postwar period, we can find just one example of a recession which starts with an inflation rate lower than the current one(2.30%). That was July 1953, the exact date of the end of the Korean war. The ending of wars always creates recessions as war spending dries up and soldiers have to find new jobs, but these are short-lived and lead ultimately to new bull markets and all time highs. So if Trump pulls all US troops back from abroad will we get a recession? Yes. Long story short: He won't. Chart for quick ANALysis(tho relatively easy to make on your own on FRED's autist playground website):\n\nhttps://imgur.com/O5U1UkY\n\nOkay, moving on. We have had no recessions at these levels of inflation, yet we live in a time of far more aggressive money printing retards than ever before. The fed will pump as much as they can into the system, as they are now doing, because it makes them look good and makes Ms. Jerome's famous blowjobs just that much better. They will justify it with all sorts of hocus-pocus logic. (\"Because inflation was below our magic 2% number for so long, we must now put inflation ABOVE the 2% money number for equally long time to break even!\" is one such 80IQ PHD rationale) \n\nOkay, but now the more discerning among you are asking: can't inflation ramp up very quickly, leading the current rates of inflation to be largely noninformative of future trends? Yes. However I have heard from many smart people that this is unlikely given the current state of the macro, the micro, and so forth. I defer your excellent question to them, and blame them fully if they are wrong.\n\nRight now in the Basic Bitch Becky Basic Business Cycle we are currently at growth, just beginning to step into overspending as falling \"true\" rates of growth must be supplemented by fed funny money so that Lord Trump can win in 2020, Mr. Jerome keeps his job and everybody looks like they know what the fuck they're doing. No recession 2020, no recession 2021. \n\nRemember to save your tendies, and Stay Hydrated.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nJim", "created_utc": 1579227574, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eptuc6/why_a_recession_is_not_in_the_cards_and_the_2020s/", "is_self": true}
