{"id": "fmr8do", "title": "Calls/Puts on leveraged ETF's?", "selftext": "Hello fellow Autists!\n\nI've been trading for a few years (mostly futures) and I'm a relative newbie when it comes to Options (pretty much just know how to buy a call or a put). Just wondering since everyone here buys calls/puts on SPY. Wouldn't it be better to instead buy options on the leveraged ETF's that track SPY? Such as SPXL/UPRO (3x bull versions of spy) or TQQQ (3x bull version of QQQ). Would the options have more return as the underlying will move 3x more?\n\nSomeone please educate this newbie autist!  \n\n\nEDIT: Nevermind, found my answer here:  \n [http://tastytradenetwork.squarespace.com/tt/blog/backtesting-options-on-leveraged-etfs](http://tastytradenetwork.squarespace.com/tt/blog/backtesting-options-on-leveraged-etfs) ", "created_utc": 1584840104.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmr8do/callsputs_on_leveraged_etfs/", "is_self": true}
