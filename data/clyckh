My reasoning for optimism is the Apple Card. \n\nI travel for business within the US. For the last few weeks, I have been noticing how many people use iPhone vs other devices. Almost every state I visited more people use iPhone and only half of them half Apple Watch (growth potential). \n\nHere is where the card comes in. They already have the customer base using their devices. I am sure they will make it easier or enticing to get the card.\n\nOne of the key aspect of the card is that Apple can use that data to market better services. (Part of the agreement of the card). That means competing with companies like yelp etc - based on your spending habits Apple can target advertise - you are where you spend your money, great marketing. \n\nOf course the other business growth can be tied to these services. Apple is spending over 4 billion in R&amp;D. Something big would have to come out of that. \n\nWhat are your thoughts? Good idea, don\u2019t do\nIt etc. looking for why it\u2019s good or why it is risky", "created_utc": 1564936598, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/clyckh/aapl_23000_call_june_2021_19/", "is_self": true}
