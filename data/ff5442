IV will remain high and we don\u2019t care?? \n\nI\u2019m too retard to figure this one out and hope WSB enlight me and other retards to maybe YOLO some more shit and post some fucking awesome tendis!!\n\nThanks guys\n\nEDIT: my fcking account don\u2019t allow me to sell options contract... only long calls/puts", "created_utc": 1583630596.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ff5442/the_option_game_in_this_high_iv_environnement/", "is_self": true}
