Apparently, it isn't worth that, as the price quickly dropped back to what it was at (118-119). \n\nI think people are still waiting on more numbers and information, such as TGT earnings (11/20) and other retailers earnings. It could be that MACY's (malls) won't survive, but TGT and WMT will. \n\nIn addition, \\[the short interest\\]([https://i.imgur.com/8TcWf3t.png](https://i.imgur.com/8TcWf3t.png)) on walmart has decreased. Soo, can we expect WMT to go up in the coming weeks? Especially before blackfriday?\n\nI personally have 11/22 FDs @125 and 11/29 @ 125\n\nIf you want to profit from WMT potentially moving from good TGT earnings, less trade war pressures, and an overall bull market, I suggest buying $121 Calls for Janurary. Maybe even $120, I don't do FDs often, but I felt good about WMT for some reason. \n\nWhat could go wrong:\n\nWalmart noted trade war is affecting their prices.\n\nI read in a daily discussion that walmart is a defensive stock, meaning it doesn't necessarily go down during bull markets and is more profitable during bear markets. \n\nWhat does WSB think?", "created_utc": 1573883039, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dx2x4s/wmt_discussion/", "is_self": true}
