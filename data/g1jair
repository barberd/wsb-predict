Luckily I still have some tendies left over from the crash. RETARDS GATHER AROUND, this isn\u2019t your father\u2019s Fed and it\u2019s not your grandfather's administration. This isn\u2019t 2008, 1987 or 1929. We\u2019ve seen those and we know how they play out, the beer virus crisis is new so stop comparing it and expecting it to behave like that old shit. Smart money is betting on Trump to be re-elected and if there's one thing that the financial industry can agree on it is that Trump is good for markets. It\u2019s clear that Trump is a believer in Modern Monetary Theory, that means that he doesn\u2019t allow budgets to get in the way of stonk gains. The man pushed a tax cut, 8 years into a bull market because there wasn\u2019t enough inflation. That was the beginning of stonks record breaking run.  Listen, I was holding SPY $200p like the rest of you retards and as much as I hate to admit it, we are in recovery mode. Look at the dumbass chart, recognize that shape that's forming? I know it's been awhile since the 2nd grade, but that shape is a V. Markets are rallying almost as violently as they sold off. We\u2019re all know that the beer virus is still killing all of New York and probably South Dakota too, the economy is shut down and nobody can pay their bills. And earnings??? Who is she? We don\u2019t know her\u2026 but what we have yet to realize is that the Trump administration will do WHATEVER IT TAKES for the S&P to break 3400 by November. \n\nRemember when we were all saying that the fed has our backs while we yolo'd our way to TSLA hitting $900? Guess what, we were right but now everyone is mad at JPOW. The fed destroyed the idea of fundamental analysis, P/E doesn\u2019t matter anymore. All that matters is companies having access to liquidity. \n\nFor the autists: Phase 1 is when JPOW started the brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr machine. It took some time to catch steam, much like lighting the fuse on a firework. We are currently in phase 2 where said firework launches towards the moon at unprecedented speed. Phase 3 is the inevitable explosion, but that\u2019s not going to happen any time soon.\n\nStrike and price? Glad you asked.\n\nSPY 5/15 297c\n\nOr buy basically any 30 delta call with 30-60 DTE that is less than $500", "created_utc": 1586917778.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1jair/jpow_youre_a_fiiiiiiiiirewooooork/", "is_self": true}
