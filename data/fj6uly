Flight attendants made mention they(Delta) weren't providing hot towels, blankets or pillows, all of which I never used before anyways. They didn't allow you to pick your snacks by hand per usual, they handed it to you, still served breakfast. Found out when we landed the conference tournaments were canceled, one of the main reasons we went.\n\nThursday 03/12 Stayed at a Caesars Property - Sportsbook was still open, you could only bet PGA and Horses. Didn't really seem they had upped their cleaning schedule. There were a few additional hand sanitizer stations but nothing more than normal. Dealers were business as usual, no masks or gloves.  As a whole it was like the whole coronavirus thing wasn't even going on to guests. Many hotels had closed the night clubs, pools, shows and buffets but I'm not sure about Caesar's properties. \n\nFriday 03/13 - Started to see a few more people wearing masks and gloves but no employees other than the janitorial staff. Was at a roulette table and someone asked the dealer if they cleaned the chips regularly in which he replied \"never\" the patron said I appreciate your honesty. Guests seemed a little more on edge as when someone coughed peopled tended to turn around and look who it was. Ended up walking to the Wynn, place was dead.\n\nSaturday 03/14 - Saw the Trump speech, got worried about a domestic travel ban so I rebooked to head home a few hours later. I have status with Delta so my wait was only 10 mins but for my friends who didn't have status and flew American had a two hour wait, others who flew Delta with no status had about a 30 to 45 min wait.  MGM announced two employees tested positive and domestic travel bans were already in place for federal employees, only a matter of time before public was my thought process. I had already lost a shit ton of money and figured I'd save money by leaving early while also proving myself a little peace of mind. Flew Delta One for the first time, those completely lay down seats and it was bad ass. Prior to take off the flight attendants asked if I had any wipes (Clorox) I'd like to throw away. Same thing on this flight, no pillows, towels or blankets but they did serve lunch. Arrived in ATL and the amount of people wearing masks and gloves had increased substantially, still not crazy numbers but way more than two days ago; saw about 3 to 4 dozen people. \n\nWYNN 04/24P $40\nMGM 05/01P $14\nLVS 05/15P $35\nCZR 05/01P $8", "created_utc": 1584300236.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fj6uly/ama_i_was_in_las_vegas_from_312_314_supposed_to/", "is_self": true}
