{"id": "fhl3r0", "title": "BAC BIG Put Option Flow", "selftext": "Today I saw BAC, they had aggressive option put orders for 15.\n\nHere - [https://imgur.com/a/vRDY55A](https://imgur.com/a/vRDY55A)\n\nThe  orders volume of the contracts exceeded the open  interest  in    multiple trades so it's  most likely not closing  positions.   Either     buy     to  open orders  or sell to open orders and  based on   the     aggressiveness  of the  orders one can infer its buy to  open.  Some  of      these may be     hedges  and some most likely not.\n\nThe TSLA calls are strangely aggressive as well.\n\nDon't   just enter YOLO's in positions  based on this data alone in most  cases.  Use   technicals/fundamentals/options data/market feelings all  combined instead of just 1 of these.   Use protection like  spreads if  you worry about losing what u put in and be smart,  understand the risks  of putting $ into weekly  expiry's, consider a longer expiry.\n\nAlso with the market going lower use technical's/fundamentals/options data-flow/market  sediment all combined.\n\nAlso, someone said ibb has ads so use an adblocker we are in 2020.\n\nEDIT - Wanted to add, puts are expensive so know that the premium is high and a move would need to be huge to make good $.\n\nEDIT  #2 - When the market is having extreme volatility it's harder for short  term options to have good success rates, consider spreads", "created_utc": 1584038109.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhl3r0/bac_big_put_option_flow/", "is_self": true}
