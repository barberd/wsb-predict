I had to keep looking up the definition of call and put on investipedia to be able to know the words I needed to make this post. I took up a job as a day laborer in Alexa factory to put together the $55 dollars dollars I currently have to my name. I am using it to buy UPWK 8/16 $15 calls $15.55 breakeven.
