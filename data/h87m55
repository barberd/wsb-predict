{"id": "h87m55", "title": "HTZ stock volume vs RH holders", "selftext": "I was trying to quantify the stupidity of this market, looking at the trading volume of HTZ.\n\nYesterday volume was above 285M, it means stocks were traded for a total value above 600M USD.\nI did not expect this value, not for a chapter 11 company traded \"only\" by RH users, in one day. \n\nIt seems to me very difficult, Robintrack shows user holding at 170K. 4000USD each, assuming that 100% of the RH holders perform one trade. I know RH is not the only platform but come on.... I cannot believe it.\n\nWhat do you economy experts think?\nDo you think it is possible that only retail is into this game with so high values?", "created_utc": 1592055182.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h87m55/htz_stock_volume_vs_rh_holders/", "is_self": true}
