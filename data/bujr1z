I had put $100 in Robinhood account last summer just for shits and giggles and have been expecting a market down turn, so I did some very light research and decided to purchase 1 SQQQ share and 3 SDOW shares and just let them sit.  They have been up and down (up +50% and down -15%).  I just checked my account this morning and my SDOW and SQQQ are gone.  I did some googling and found that the SQQQ and SDOW had a reverse 4-1 stock split on Friday.  My question is, since I did not hold 4 of these stocks I lose my entire position in them?  Thanks for your help in advance.", "created_utc": 1559161854, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bujr1z/sqqq_sdow_reverse_split/", "is_self": true}
