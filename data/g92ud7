However, after that IV crush i'm back in the position [Proof](https://imgur.com/a/dvnDzNk) i still think the thesis holds but ya'll drove up IV out the wazoo\n\nAaaaaanyways I got a JUICY one for you guys.\n\nOnce again, always do your own DD and research.\n\n[Level 2 Data and Option Chain](https://imgur.com/a/GZXWoc7)\n\n**TL,DR: CERS 5/15 6C**\n\n**COMPANY BACKGROUND**\n\nCerus Group is a medical device manufacturer in Southern California. They primarily specialize in blood, platelet, and plasma purification procedures. Now, normally their services aren't usually in too high demand, as most blood donors are pre-screened for diseases or other ailments. However, with the COVID-19 crisis driving governments and companies to find a cure, it puts Cerus group in an extremely advantageous position. Because COVID-19 antibody rich plasma is relatively rare and extremely valuable to study, labs cannot afford to screen patients, and considering most patients are older and have numerous ailments, their INTERCEPT procedure is extremely vital to purifying blood plasma in order to isolate COVID-19 antibodies. In fact, a look on their website shows that their process is already FDA approved for isolating COVID antibodies.\n\nWith the ramp up in antibody testing as well as an increase in testing, Cerus is expected to not only continue it current run up, but gain momentum rapidly as retail investors begin to pick up the scent. So far, the stock is 90% owned by institutions, a good sign that momentum is yet to pick up with the COVID-19 hype.\n\n**OPTIONS ACTIVITY**\n\nOn Friday, the 5/15 16C experienced an option volume of almost 5,000, representing a number of shares equal to almost a third of total daily volume. Open interest on the morning sat at 2000, indicating that there was significant opening of positions. Judging by the bid ask spread, most orders were at the ask, indicating aggressive buying. The largest order was an opening position of 1,665 contracts. However, this order's price was smack in the middle of the B/A, which is why I suggest caution entering this trade.\n\nUpon further inspection, the one minute chart indicates that the price increased slightly at the time of purchase of this huge block order. This indicates that the MMs that sold these options had to buy shares in order to hedge their delta. The price increase as well as the fact that institutions like to trade with a trend leads me to believe that the order was a discrete buy order to open, but the price action was so small that you really need to be careful.\n\n**Institutional Thesis**\n\nI believe that the institutions trading this option are bullish on this stock. It's a straight long call, and there was evidence of numerous sweep orders.\n\nOn the other hand, there was significant selling of this option as well, which is why I encourage caution and perhaps more analysis and discussion.\n\nI want to hear what you guys think, cheers\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQA: Is there still room to run after going up 5% today: Obviously since I'm posting it. Price target 6.5-7\n\nare there risks: Of course. Do your own DD before entering any trade\n\nhow is IV: IV was already fucked when I entered the position, so yeah, it's pretty high. But delta should make up for it\n\nEarnings: May 5th. Skewed to the upside. I expect guidance to moon this stock, never before has CERS's INTERCEPT been more valuable", "created_utc": 1588001371.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g92ud7/cers_unusual_options_activity/", "is_self": true}
