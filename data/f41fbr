{"id": "f41fbr", "title": "SPCE Options", "selftext": "Wanted to say this, SPCE has been rocketing up lately, Pretty confident these orders are correct and it will move higher at some point soon\n\nHere were the orders today - [https://ibb.co/wJJYyYv](https://ibb.co/wJJYyYv)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI see lots of little kids running around asking for the tendies so here is some advice.  Ideally you want to get in on the move before it happens. For example if you look at the old technicals for spce back awhile ago it based a support around $7-$8 and started to move higher. While this happened their were aggressive orders for calls going awhile out (a few months). That is when to follow them before the move has been made not chasing it now going $30+.\n\nHere is data back at the $7-$9 price mark - [https://ibb.co/PcPF9Xp](https://ibb.co/PcPF9Xp) , I have option data all through the teens too. I have so many examples where their was extreme call buying in spce that it would take awhile to import all the data, edit it, and publish but this has been happening for awhile.\n\nI feel now it's too late in the move to chase. Sure their will be more upside but why chase it? Just like TSLA, ppl were getting in back at $400-$500-$550 for huge moves higher. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy point is some of you little kids run around asking your mom for the tendies. Wait and get in early. Think of it like your sniping a target, you don't start chasing your target when you miss to get it, you wait and carefully plan your entry/exit/target/potential loss/etc... When sniping a target you calculate your bullet trajectory among other things and wait instead of rushing it.\n\nThink of it like a market sniper. Plan and then action instead of action then plan.", "created_utc": 1581725760, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f41fbr/spce_options/", "is_self": true}
