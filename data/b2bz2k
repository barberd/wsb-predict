{"id": "b2bz2k", "title": "New to investing, can somebody please explain how bankruptcy affects PG&amp;E stock?", "selftext": "So, I remember PG&amp;E stock hitting very low prices of like $9 a share back in February, because the news of Bankruptcy and acquisition broke out. I believe this was because if the company is bought out, all stock is lost without compensation? However, the stock has been steadily recovering since then, reaching $20 now and is continuing to rise. Is the risk of the stock's being lost no longer a problem, and otherwise, why are people still buying into PG&amp;E? And would it be worth buying a significant amount of stock right now with long-term return in mind?", "created_utc": 1552868028, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b2bz2k/new_to_investing_can_somebody_please_explain_how/", "is_self": true}
