Today, saw someone pay  $350,000 for 2 days to get guaranteed borrow on 100,000 shares. He must be getting margin calls on his short from his broker.\n\nSo here's what he did\n\nsold 1,000 June $70.0 c $1.37bought 1,000 June $70.0 p $9.37bought 100,000 shares at $65.5\n\nIf he just sits on this position, on Friday's close, he is out $3.5 no matter what.\n\nSo think what he did is turn around and sell the 100,000 shares that he is long. He is now left with long put short call position which behaves like short stock.\n\nHe needs the stock to drop at least 3.5 from here by Friday so he can cover for a profit.\n\nLongs out there may want to get paid to replace their long stock with long call/short put.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSource:\n\n[https://www.volsage.com/activityInName.php?ticker=nkla](https://www.volsage.com/activityInName.php?ticker=nkla)\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NKLA/options?p=NKLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NKLA/options?p=NKLA)\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1592420745.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/haxu3p/nkla_will_you_pay_350000_for_2_days_to_borrow/", "is_self": true}
