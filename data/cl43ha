{"id": "cl43ha", "title": "What are thoughts on investing in the weed industry?", "selftext": "I'm fairly new to this, but I am very interested. I've been watching the stocks of several companies for a while and while one (Aurora Cannabis ACB) is a canadian based company that tends to go up and down, as a company their business plan is incredible. They just signed a deal with UFC to study CBD. They are in 25 countries. They have a focus mostly on medicinal and top grade cannabis. Also a very cheap investment for the time being.\n\nAnother one I've been watching is Canopy, which is Snoop and Martha Stewart's company which is US based and focuses heavily on edibles. I know less about them than Aurora, though their current stock price is more than Aurora (roughly 5x).\n\nWith legalization becoming more prevalent is now a good time to invest? Thoughts on any of this?", "created_utc": 1564752410, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cl43ha/what_are_thoughts_on_investing_in_the_weed/", "is_self": true}
