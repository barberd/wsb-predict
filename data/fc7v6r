Unbelievable comparisons to symptoms 'showing' as a V-Irus compared vs what happens when one is hit with 60GHz waves, and it's impact on the uptake of oxygen via the hemoglobin. This specific frequency is absorbed by oxygen. 60GHz causes the rotation of the electrons around the oxygen molecule to spin, thus inhibiting the ability of hemoglobin to properly uptake these oxygen molecules. What would be the ultimate 'solution' to such a problem as this \"V.I.Rus\"? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XByF0fcFM0w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XByF0fcFM0w)", "created_utc": 1583130023, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fc7v6r/new_angle_retards_5g_in_wuhan/", "is_self": true}
