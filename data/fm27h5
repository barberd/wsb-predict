Do not worry I bought some RCL P $35 4/3 and sold monday on minimun profit. Because I was thinking \"wtf cruises are suspended so why tf is up.\" Sold at  around 32$ price. Two days later on wednesday it dropped below $25. Sometimes there are delays for prices to react to news and it is not priced in. \n\nAlso I was right you witchers, called market drop -3 to -5% by EOW. Red Friday. \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/filvlz/all\\_you\\_bears\\_with\\_paper\\_hands\\_have\\_to\\_get\\_a\\_hold/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/filvlz/all_you_bears_with_paper_hands_have_to_get_a_hold/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)\n\nTLDR: Don't get bamboozled TESLA will drop early next week. \n\nCurrent Plays:\n\n LULU $125 put - 4/24\n\nVXX $95 call - 4/24\n\nLYFT $20 Put - 4/24\n\nVXX $85 call 5/1\n\nPredictions: M-R ,T-R, W-G, TH-R, F-G   EOW -2 to -4 %\n\nThe Markets can't free fall like this all the time. During  a recession we will start to have more green days and even close green for EOW probably starting mid to late next month. But after a few weeks of that we will continue to keep going down.
