{"id": "d5c226", "title": "SPY DD- Market Crash incoming most likely", "selftext": "So I've been trading SPY options for like 7 days now and the market seems like it's glued to 300. I bought 302 calls- lost money. I bought 300 puts- lost money. So I figured I should do some actual analysis instead of burning my money. \n\nSo I googled \"300\" to figure out why SPY liked it so much and it led me to the wiki page for the Battle of Thermopylae, where 300 Spartans died to some Persians. When did the Battle happen? Late in the month of September. \n\nWe are currently in the month of September and the President of the stock market just basically threatened to go to war with all of Persia last night on Twitter. If my calculations are correct, SPY 300 is fucked and has the possibility of reaching 0 very soon. \n\nTldr; the SPY 300, much like the 300 of Sparta, is gonna get fucked by the end of this month. Load up on puts they literally cannot go tits up.", "created_utc": 1568694976, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d5c226/spy_dd_market_crash_incoming_most_likely/", "is_self": true}
