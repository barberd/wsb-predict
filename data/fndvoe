This is the culmination of the WSB play for this week (and weeks to come):  \n  \n* [Futures hit a 5% limit breaker today](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fn8awl/breaking_futures_hit_limit_down_in_the_first_5/). Tomorrow should be bloody. Weekend put holders look to sell tomorrow but maybe not right at opening bell. People in comments sections have been saying \"iS tOmOrRoW tHe DoUbLe BrEaKeR dAy?\" Nobody knows. Every breaker we've had these past couple of weeks has not been followed by another massive downturn. We've hypothesized double breakers before and it still hasn't happened. Sell your puts for gainz and roll into the next thing. But make sure to take your hot crispy tendies, don't make the mistake of waiting to squeeze the extra $3/contract out and then losing a bunch because you tried to time the market.  \n\n* Take your gains and roll them into the next thing. But what is the next thing? You can [wait for the bounce](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fn93z5/wait_for_the_inverse_dips/) and buy more puts. You can [buy calls at where you think the bottom might be and buy VIX puts with them to avoid IV crush](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmshcv/when_market_bounce_inevitably_comesdont_scream/). If you do buy calls, make sure to [hedge your bet](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fn5f4p/hedging_for_autists/) (basically the same DD twice-this shit must be important). Too bad I need to wear a helmet to leave the house and can't understand it.  \n\n* Nobody knows when the bounce will come but a lot of autists out there with much more wrinkled brains than me think [a bounce is definitely coming](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmhz1p/the_great_unwinding_why_wsb_will_keep_losing/) and the low could be all the way down to 213 but don't sit around and wait for that to hit to sell your tendies. Nobody ever went broke taking a profit. If you believe [this autistic fuck](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fm30na/dd_the_market_might_crash_hard_next_thursday_and/) then you'll be looking for a [b o u n c e](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmzu51/incoming_bounce_vix_puts/) to buy more puts or you'll be #cashgang until Thursday.  \n\n* BUT WHAT'S MY PLAY? STRIKE/EXPY OR BAN. Yeah, so if you want to listen to [somebody who doesn't know how to use Microsoft Excel](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmgg6l/i_manually_calculated_profit_margins_on_various/), you'll pick up some $SPY $180p 4/13 to sell on 4/3. His calculations were based on 2.69/share...good luck finding it for that price tomorrow.  \n  \n**TL;DR: Autist reads WSB and tries to gather the \"best\" DD in one post so his fellow retards don't have to use the even more retarded reddit search function. $SPY 69 4/20 or $SPY 180 4/13. I'm retarded. To inverse me buy my 3k of $SPY 280c 3/27 and save me from investing in $ROPE**", "created_utc": 1584937538.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fndvoe/the_wsb_playbook_323327/", "is_self": true}
