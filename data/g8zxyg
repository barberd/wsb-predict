It's almost like a pump and dump scheme.\n\nTake it what you may.\nBulls, you may be thinking, good fucking news, they haven't even gotten started yet.\nGay Bears, like me, I think this bubble is gonna burst real soon.\n\nEDIT: you know those special purchase vehicles SPVs that the FED's setting up, guess who's paying for that? tax money and pension funds. And leveraged. Lose money, np, more tax money and pension funds. Wait till main street start to realize what Trump and FED'S up to. I am starting to think that maybe Trump is so eager to open the economy because he knows this scheme can only last for so long. May the wsb kid bless us all.\n\n\nEDIT2: IK,IK, this may or may not be useful. But at least we bears can sleep sound knowing that it is actually a bubble, albeit we may not know when it will burst.
