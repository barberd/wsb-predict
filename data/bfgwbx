{"id": "bfgwbx", "title": "Gamble with me", "selftext": "Some plays for y'all. Obviously I don't condone doing anything posted here and your investment choices are yours alone. Options are very risky etc etc. I'm posting this primarily to hear reddit's thoughts on my positions.\n\nI invest in shit I understand and believe in. I have a medical background so i focus on healthcare. My philosophy is to go long and try to stay away from FDs as much as possible. I don't have the time to be checking my phone throughout the day or worrying about my positions. I set it and forget it.\n\nI will not advise you on individual strike, expiration etc. If you can't figure that out for yourself you need to stay away from this game. \n\n\nDexCom: this is a diabetes company that makes blood glucose sensors that don't require traditional calibration via finger stick. Totally revolutionized the industry with their G6 continuous glucose monitoring system. Their sensors are used with Tandems insulin pumps and they've partnered with Eli Lilly (\nhttps://provider.dexcom.com/industry-news/dexcom-announces-development-agreement-lilly-integrate-dexcom-cgm-connected-diabetes) and Novo nordisk as well recently. The next gen G7 sensor is in development with Alphabet a development partner. \n\nThe stock has recently taken a beating due to competition from Abbott's freestyle libre system which is similar to DexComs system. There are subtle differences. I believe DexCom makes the superior product by a thin margin. The next generation product, the G7 will likely be far superior to anything on the market.\n\nI think the diabetes market is large enough to support multiple large competitors anyways. \n\nEarnings are May 1st. I am bullish because I believe outlook on this company is great, Tandem did great with their last earnings and diabetes is rampant. Go long. \n\n\nNovartis: \nCan we talk about this company for a sec?\n\nJust take a second and look at that beast of a pipeline. \n\nTake a look at some of their assets. Some big names include Entresto and Gleevec. I'm super bullish because of their gad Dotatate product Lutathera, used for imaging AND treatment of neuroendocrine tumors. It's some real advanced shit and a real money maker for hospitals. \n\nRecent shift to focus on high margin products, including sell off of Alcon. Market perceived this as negative for some reason? I'm bullish.\n\nCheck the RSI on this company in the teens. \n\nWe're going into earnings soon. This may be the one for FDs, tbh. \n\n\nGME:\nCome on now. Do I even need to say anything here? This pos going to Earth's core. Their business model is fucked with streaming games coming. Disc-less Xbox to be announced in May, that will be a shot to the knees. The more we hear about Stadia (alphabet's streaming game service) and the likely soon to be announced competition from Amzn, this stock will continue to crater further and further. Moreover, they've guided eps of 0.00 for first quarter. So that nice dividend they've been paying out for so long? That won't be sustainable much longer when their cash flow is negative and the coffers are empty.\n\nShort this shit. Long dated puts as volume allows. \n\n\nMCD: \nI'm gonna be honest here. I recently watched the Ray kroc movie on Netflix and fell in love with McDonald's as a company. Ray Kroc was one of us. \n\nBesides all that, MCD doing some great shit with the drive thru and incorporating AI, data harvesting and all sorts of smart 2019 tech into their restaurants. It's some really innovative stuff. Big data works, just ask Daddy Trump. \n\nLong dated calls/spreads and shares is the play here. \n\nThey've got earnings coming up, I don't see any particular reason to partake in FD type gambling. Instead, the smart move would be to sell puts at peak IV, as the worst that can happen is you pick up some shares of a great company that's very likely to do well long term. Or buy LEAP calls and sell weekly, OTM calls against those if you're bullish short term.... I'm not even sure why I bother writing this, I know y'all will be buying FD calls at $210 the second the market opens anyways. \n\n\nWhat are your thoughts?", "created_utc": 1555793279, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bfgwbx/gamble_with_me/", "is_self": true}
