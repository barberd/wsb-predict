They all said to buy low and sell high. They did, but I didn\u2019t listen. They all said that the market is incredibly volatile and having a good exit strategy is critical. They did, but I didn\u2019t listen. They said that JPOW can print money and maintain this economy with a right mouse click. The did, but I didn\u2019t listen. \n\nBecause in my infinite wisdom, you know what sounded right? Continually shorting airlines. Could I have doubled my life\u2019s savings by buying crypto 3 months ago and holding until today? Sure, but where\u2019s the fun in that? Could I have bought $420 TSLA  calls and said fuck the gay bears and made a fortune \u2014 sure. But that\u2019s boring. \n\nInstead I watch out of the window of my cardboard box (albeit a big one) the U.S. economy slowly open and my options for my options dwindle.\n\nSometimes, you just need a pick-me-up. I am starting a GoFundMe to reverse my shitty trades. I figured that instead of continually wasting your money on puts, you should instead just waste it on me.\n\nCheers.", "created_utc": 1591136439.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gvh9qz/im_just_a_shitty_trader/", "is_self": true}
