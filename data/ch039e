{"id": "ch039e", "title": "Unusual HUGE stock jumps with no news or catalyst - July 2019. DD", "selftext": "There is some weird momentum or squeeze type activity going on this month. It's more than what's normal. I'm wondering if anyone has noticed or might have insight.\n\nSpecifically, there have been several huge, double-digit %, price moves in certain random tickers, out of nowhere - no clear news, rumors or catalyst causing it to happen. See below. \n\n*Disclaimer before you fools start shitreplying to this post. Just to be clear, yes big prices moves with no news or rumor do happen from time to time, and short squeezes do happen (though squeezes often have a public catalyst like surprisingly good updated guidance that triggers the squeeze).* \n\n*Also I know there are many newbie traders on here who know nothing about stocks yet or you only know about earnings and won't have any idea what I'm talking about or what all these words and symbols mean. BUT I also know there are a handful of guys on here usually hiding in the shadows who actually do know what they are doing when it comes to trading and have experience and so I'm posting this on the odd chance I get an informed reply. Thanks.*\n\n**Ok for example, this is just in the last 3 days:**\n\n**$YETI is up 12% today.** Why? I see no news. \n\n**$LCI was up 40% yesterday.** Why? I see no news. \n\n**$DDS was up 24% on Friday.** Why? I see no news. \n\nAgain I acknowledge stocks gap up with no news sometimes. And yes there could be news causing them and I just missed it when I searched, in which case I've just totally embarrassed myself and look stupid and lazy now. But I did search, and I'm not new to trading, and I can't remember seeing such huge double-digit moves on no news **and** so many instances of it in such a short span of time. It's starting to feel coordinated or manipulation or something like that. \n\nHas anyone else noticed this? Have any insight? Anyone think I'm wrong and this shit isn't so unique, this is normal, don't overthink it, nothing to see here?\n\nThanks", "created_utc": 1563923801, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ch039e/unusual_huge_stock_jumps_with_no_news_or_catalyst/", "is_self": true}
