I'm not expecting any of them to go out of business personally, but many are expecting another 10% or even further drop on SPY and worse depending on the business. With arguments of mirroring from the 2008 graphs, falling bond yields, and the possibility of foreign banks issues.

To our (before fall) of over 3,000 points. I would give counter-argument that this is not a bubble at least to my non-expert retard research and if it was at all a smaller one. Examples of financial bubbles can be found below. \n\n [https://medium.com/swlh/how-do-financial-bubbles-really-work-9d2ffca8de7](https://medium.com/swlh/how-do-financial-bubbles-really-work-9d2ffca8de7) \n\nTalking on cruise lines. During the 2002-2003 SARS Scare RCL dropped in that time 38% and CCL 32% in total. (RCL 23 to 14 and CCL 33 to 23). Obviously Coronavirus is much more serious but RCL has already dropped 47% and CCL 39.47% so while we keep going I'm not sure how much more it can fall at this point I guess. \n\nThis is the site used to gather stock history  [https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CCL/carnival/stock-price-history](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CCL/carnival/stock-price-history) \n\nI personally am expecting another drop as the US cases increases as we \\*eventually\\* start testing people smh on that. There are obviously many other factors like the large amount of repo money being put in and how another rate cut could affect us most views are overall negative and that we may enter the forbidden r-word without tools to help. \n\nSo yeah what does everyone else think? Also, u/Peetrius deserves a flair for eating nut as promised please gay bois get on that. \n\nPositions are I blew up my account so yeah.\n\nTl;dr: How fucked are we", "created_utc": 1583538604.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/femmej/what_bottom_do_you_expect/", "is_self": true}
