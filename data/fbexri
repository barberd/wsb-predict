All I do is drive from my house to work where I spend the day day trading and pretending to work while passing all my work down the person below me. I literally barely interact with anyone but my wife and I spend my weeknights and weekends yelling at kids on league of legends in between the limited messages they give me in game. \n\nOn a scale to 1-10 I\u2019ve got to be a 2, maybe, for likelihood of getting this thing. And boom, two nights ago I had a tickle in my throat. Yesterday I got full blown sick, and now here I am reading about symptoms and I have them all. I assume it\u2019s 1 of my two Chinese neighbors that brought this upon me. I saw him last week and I pretended to understand what he was saying for 5 minutes the other day while in my backyard. \n.", "created_utc": 1582993755, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fbexri/i_have_the_coronavirus_cali_usa/", "is_self": true}
