{"id": "eg83pz", "title": "Aurora Cannabis and \"Drift\" hype", "selftext": "I know everyone and their grandmother has been posting about ACB the past two days, but I found something interesting while searching for more info on \"Drift\", which a lot of posters have been saying was the name of a drink that ACB would be producing in partnership with Coca-Cola. Instead, based on the header image from \\[this\\]([https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/on-the-second-day-of-christmas-the-government-sold-to-me-a-gummy-containing-thc](https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/on-the-second-day-of-christmas-the-government-sold-to-me-a-gummy-containing-thc)) article, it looks like \"Aurora Drift\" is the brand of ACB's entry into the \"Cannabis 2.0\" market (which opened up the Canadian market to edibles and more variety of cannabis products). While it's possible that this could include some sort of drink, Aurora's recent press release, an in-house video, and other articles have only mentioned their new vape products, chocolates, gummies, and a few others - but no drinks as of now.\n\nI've also seen in various other boards that \"Drift\" will be the name which Aurora uses to enter the U.S. market. Now it's unclear when that might happen, but I do find it interesting that Aurora has already started using its \"Drift\" name in Canadian retail stores (based on the article image) but is maintaining secrecy around the brand on all online platforms until January 1st. Not sure if maybe the retail entry was mistimed or, maybe, that they're planning for a global launch of the brand on the first day of the new year. Also of note is that they recently hired a new \"Global Government Relations\" SVP, likely around mid-December (although it was just announced in their recent statement on the 23rd). While this role is probably just to handle their current dealings with various governments, they haven't had this role in the past as they've worked with governments from Europe and other places - so this could signal something. \n\nHope this helps some of y'all out there", "created_utc": 1577431640, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eg83pz/aurora_cannabis_and_drift_hype/", "is_self": true}
