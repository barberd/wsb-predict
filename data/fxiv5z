And, as I have said many times before, it has worked so well simply because of the mathematics of compounding: the big losses are essentially ALL that matter to your rate of compounding, not the small losses\u2014and not even the big or small gains. The big losses literally destroy your geometric returns and, equivalently, your wealth, through what I have called the \u201cvolatility tax.\u201d For risk mitigation to be effective, it therefore must focus primarily on mitigating those big, rare losses (the tails). More specifically, risk mitigation must have a very high \u201cbang-for-the buck\u201d in a portfolio when the chips are down in a crash, relative to the portfolio cost of that \u201cbuck\u201d the rest of the time\u2014a very \u201cconvex\u201d (tail) hedge.
