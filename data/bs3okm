{"id": "bs3okm", "title": "Mega-autistic DD", "selftext": " \n\nThis is too big to post in the Tesla megathread, so hopefully the mods can supress their gayness for a second and not remove this.  \n\nI\u2019ll start off by saying I never played TSLA, as I always thought it was retardedly overhyped and just overall unpredictable af. But I can\u2019t ignore what I\u2019m seeing, an opportunity to make fat stacks.\n\nTL;DR: Doesn\u2019t matter if you hate Tesla to death or would fondle Elon\u2019s balls with your tongue, doesn\u2019t matter if you think it\u2019s gonna go to 0 or $500b, you should think about playing it, short term this shit\u2019s about to launch another TSLA to space. June $40 puts are retarded.\n\nTSLA, the stats:\n\nShares outstanding: 176.77M \u2013 34.07B mkt cap @ yesterday\u2019s close\n\nShares free float: 126.83M \u2013 24.44B mkt cap @ yesterday\u2019s close\n\nWent down another \\~4% pre-market, to \\~$185/share\n\n3-month average daily volume: 10.83M shares / day\n\nYesterday\u2019s volume: 18.69M shares / day\n\n4/30/2019 short data:\n\nShort days to cover: 3.1\n\nShort % of float: 29.90%\n\nShares short: 37.925M\n\nEstimated short volume @ yesterday\u2019s close: 57M shares - 45% float shorted\n\nShort availability data from Interactive Brokers, in number of shortable shares:\n\n2019.04.14 TSLA|TESLA INC|700,000\n\n2019.04.15 TSLA|TESLA INC|800,000\n\n2019.05.02 TSLA|TESLA INC|450,000\n\n2019.05.22 @ 18:00:03 TSLA|TESLA INC|75,000\n\n2019.05.23 @ 06:30:02 TSLA|TESLA INC|200,000\n\n2019.05.23 @ 06:45:03 TSLA|TESLA INC|250,000\n\n2019.05.23 @ 07:00:03 TSLA|TESLA INC|250,000\n\n2019.05.23 @ 07:30:02 TSLA|TESLA INC|100,000\n\nWhat does the move from 75k availability to 250k this early morning, and back to 100k later this morning? It\u2019s the first wave of shorts covering, and the second wave shorting. Translation for you autists, smart money covered, dumb money is now shorting.\n\nOptions volume &amp; Max pain (Friday exp):\n\nTop call strikes:\n\n\\* 200 \u2013 18.5k vol\n\n\\* 205 \u2013 16k vol\n\n\\* 210 \u2013 11k vol\n\nTop put strikes:\n\n\\* 190 \u2013 17.3k\n\n\\* 195 - 11k\n\n\\* 200 \u2013 10.8k\n\nMax pain $205\n\nSeptember 2019 max pain $255\n\n40.000 puts with strike over $200 expiring this Friday. That\u2019s 4M shares to be assigned. Even though some of those are spreads, are there enough shares available to be assigned short for the nakeds, or will put holders need to buy? You decide!\n\nLooking at retail buying trends on Robinhood (info via https://robintrack.net/symbol/TSLA):\n\n1st January 2019: 81,923 TSLA holders on RH\n\n15th April 2019: 131,983 TSLA holders on RH\n\n13th May 2019: 146,812 TSLA holders on RH\n\n23rd May 2019 (yesterday): 156,175 TSLA holders on RH\n\nAssuming the average TSLA holder on RH holds 10 shares, that\u2019s 1.56M TSLA shares held on RH, or 1.2% of float. On RH, the buttcrack of stock brokers! That\u2019s insane. And I think assuming 10 shares / holder is an underestimation. While many may have just 1-2 shares, there\u2019s plenty of \u201cwhales\u201d that hold a lot more, including many that hold TSLA for selling covered calls, so a minimum 100 shares.  \n\n10 shares / holder avg = 1.2% of float\n\n20 shares / holder avg = 2.4% of float\n\n50 shares / holder  avg = 6% of float\n\nAbsolutely bonkers! I also estimate that around 80,000 of the RH holders bought at prices under $190 / share. Use the retail HODLERS to your advantage.\n\nThings to keep in mind:\n\n\\* Due to the sudden drop, a lot of put sellers will be assigned shares that they have to get rid of, potentially further tanking the price short-term\n\n\\* Elon\u2019s wink tweet yesterday &amp; general propensity to fuck around ala \u201c420 funding secured\u201d. I don\u2019t know what bullshit he\u2019ll pull out of his ass this time, but ask yourself if you really think he\u2019s not going to try to pull something.\n\n\\* Elon owns about 50% of the $30b SpaceX, which could potentially be used to bailout Tesla if needed (as per the leaked Morgan Stanley call)\n\n\\* Tesla still has $4B in cash on hand. Even if they\u2019re gonna go bust, don\u2019t be fooled into thinking it\u2019s going bust next week and take advantage of the panic &amp; FOMO.\n\n\\* Look into the institutional holders. Who is holding TSLA? Think about who would sell &amp; who wouldn\u2019t.\n\nOne last juicy bit: I\u2019ve heard some faint whispers that both Berkshire as well as Bezos are getting involved, Warren taking a stake in Tesla &amp; Bezos about getting a partnership agreement to supply some tech to one of his other ventures (that I don\u2019t know anything about). I\u2019m working hard to get some more info on this, but for now, you really should treat this as bullshit I pulled out of my ass. But if you think about it, it does sound like it could be legit. Just think about how &amp; what Buffer OG likes to yolo.\n\nRead this (and use your critical brain, motherfuckers):\n\n\\* [https://www.ccn.com/elon-musk-warren-buffett-berkshire-tesla](https://www.ccn.com/elon-musk-warren-buffett-berkshire-tesla)\n\n\\* [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshire-lithium/berkshire-denies-media-report-on-accord-to-extract-lithium-idUSKCN1PE0SX](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshire-lithium/berkshire-denies-media-report-on-accord-to-extract-lithium-idUSKCN1PE0SX)\n\nKeywords: Tesla, Geico, lithium, synergy\n\nI\u2019ll leave you with this bit (from this article https://theweek.com/articles/459166/how-warren-buffett-made-10-billion-during-financial-crisis):\n\n\\&gt; \u201cThe deals Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway made from2008 to 2011 involved giant, blue-chip companies like Mars, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, and Dow Chemical.Taking advantage of the general atmosphere of panic, Berkshire Hathaway was able to use its\"gigantic cash hoard to move swiftly and exact lucrative terms that created a stream of payments from the borrowers,\" says the Journal. For example, Buffett pumped $5 billion into Goldman Sachs shortly after Lehman Brothers collapsed, a massive boost of confidence in Goldman that shored up its stock price. Buffett bought $5 billion in preferred shares, and as part of the deal won warrants for an additional $5 billion worth of common shares. Which brings us to the real key to Buffett's success: Being Warren Buffett. When you've got the Midas touch, nearly every deal you make boosts investor confidence in the company in question, turning its success into a self-fulfilling prophecy.\u201d\n\nDisclaimer: I just liquidated most of my shit and took a long call position of $125k, which is worth about 80-85% of my portfolio, so I\u2019m either going big or going home bois (and by home I probably mean home-less). And no, I\u2019m not going to post strikes &amp; expirations, so don\u2019t ask. While some of you will surely go \u201churr durr trying to pump &amp; dump worthless penny stock\u201d, it\u2019s also putting my money where my mouth is. Besides, I couldn\u2019t pump shit with you monkeys.\n\nAlso, remember bois, this is not investment advice, don\u2019t base your investment yolos on what some rando is posting online.", "created_utc": 1558622000, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bs3okm/megaautistic_dd/", "is_self": true}
