When JPow hit the unlimited QE to ruin Bloody Monday 1.0 he halted the momentum, this is also when POTUS started taking the virus seriously and now the stock market is fixed (corrected).  \n\nFor every real reason we should be limit down tomorrow, but it is not a real thing and we will finish the week green.
