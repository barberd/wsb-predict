However, there are some embarrassing options sticking around from when I was full retard.\n\nHypothetically, if I have a call option for fucking Blue Apron (yes, seriously) that is worth zero and will continue to be worth zero until expiration (June), can I just dump it?

Can I just burn it so to speak?", "created_utc": 1557871617, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bop9xe/question_to_help_me_forget/", "is_self": true}
