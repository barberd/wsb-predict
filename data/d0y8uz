This is a non-sensical poll because people on WSB are morons, but I'm interested. Please post below your reason why or why not for where you think the S&amp;P will close.\n\nReasons it could close higher:\n\n* Trump Daddy clears the air ahead of the 2020 election year by settling things with China relating to the trade dispute and tariffs\n* News reports of trade talks with China in October 2020 are positive or somewhat constructive, even if nothing definitive happens\n* Consumer spending remains very strong for Q3 2019 earnings (watch WMT, TGT, AMZN, BBY, KR, and MCD as discretionary and staples) that are reported in October 2019\n* Federal Reserve continues lowering the federal funds rate to cut interest rates\n\nReasons it could close lower:\n\n* US macro data is weakening, we already saw this with China and Germany, plus US latest jobs numbers missed consensus; this trend continues\n* Market is very tippy and the 3,000 level has meaningful technical resistance that has failed to stick several times\n* The market only have 1 true correction this year in May 2019 and a flash correction in early August 2019 (which lasted VERY shortly)\n* Q4 2019 could be like Q4 2018 as traders lockup bonus for the year and dump positions ahead of re-buying in January 2020\n* Nothing gets done with trade, China keeps acting shitty\n* FY 2020 guidance for the few companies that will report in December is lackluster\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThick Daddy Trashy is interested in people's opinions.\n\nThanky.", "created_utc": 1567874288, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d0y8uz/wall_street_bets_dickhead_poll_does_sp_500_close/", "is_self": true}
