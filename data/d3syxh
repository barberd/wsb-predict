{"id": "d3syxh", "title": "China trade DD follow up.", "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a follow up to the DD I wrote several weeks ago, where I advocated a sharp escalation in the trade war in the first few months of 2020. Here is the link ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cuv4wh/my\\_china\\_theory\\_dd\\_the\\_trade\\_war\\_is\\_going\\_to\\_hit/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cuv4wh/my_china_theory_dd_the_trade_war_is_going_to_hit/)). TL/DR at bottom. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nContext:\n\nPLEASE READ my original post before this (ignore stock play recommendations at the end of my prior post, they are honestly retarded and I changed my mind on it and will detail my current position at the end). Did you read it? No? Go read it. This entire post is couched in my diagnosis of the situation as detailed in the prior post. Therefore, reading this alone won\u2019t provide a sufficient argument, so go read it. Below I have written down a step by step explanation of what is going on contextually, as I see it. The TL/DR is at the bottom. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(1) Both sides have a lot to lose IF THEY ARE BLAMED for a failed interim deal and the resulting escalation. This is a huge issue and it characterizes all of the news you have been reading this past week. If the trade war escalates it will cause a global recession and it will have huge consequences for whichever side receives most of the \u2018blame\u2019 for the resulting escalation. Whoever is blamed for this will face serious consequences: go read my prior post for how a Chinese recession would affect Xi and his cabal. For the U.S., a failed negotiation that is blamed on Trump would lead to him being canned and then prosecuted without his executive legal protections.\n\n \n\n(2) However, Trump DOES have the upper hand and everyone knows it. China has a weaker hand and they know it. How do both parties handle this situation? How do you try and strong arm someone WHILE preventing them from claiming you\u2019re an irrational asshole if a deal doesn\u2019t occur and shit gets real hot? This is how: you shape international opinion before the meeting. You use REALLY flowery language. Both sides postpone tariffs or peel them back. Both sides say \u201cI\u2019m open to an interim deal!\u201d. Both sides praise the others\u2019 leadership, congratulate them on a national holiday, and make the world think that you are ALSO interested in a de-escalation. Both sides tell the world that they are the responsible party and want a de-escalation. Everything that is going on right now is shaping their respective domestic audiences to blame the other side should negotiations fail and escalation occur. More importantly, by claiming to be the most reasonable party, you greatly reinforce your strength in talks, as the fallout from walking is less for you than it is for the other party. To restate this in simple terms, if China is successful in convincing it\u2019s people and Americans that they want de-escalation, but offer little, Trump throws a fit and escalates, they will still \u2018win\u2019: Trump will take the blame in both China and the U.S. for the resulting economic fallout.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(3) Per my prior post, China wants Trump out of office. They will be reluctant to give him what he wants here, which is a \u201cmeal ticket to reelection\u201d. That is what Trump is going to ask for. Everyone knows he has the stronger hand, so he is going to ask China for a \u201cGREAT\u201d deal. He has literally never settled for a shitty deal when he was in a strong bargaining position. Big agricultural purchases. Eliminated tariffs on American exports. Good-sounding intellectual property protection (although he may not push on this, and will seek big purchases instead, knowing if he is reelected he can push on IP in 2021). He wants a deal so good, he can parade around swing states and claim he took it to the Chinese to the cleaners. The stock market will moon, swing states will get Chinese tendies rained on them, and Trump will get reelected. The quid pro quo is that he won\u2019t escalate with his stronger-hand while asking the Chinese to help him get reelected. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(4) However, China is unlikely to go along with this. They want him out. They know if he is reelected he\u2019ll reneg and come back asking for a better deal. They don\u2019t trust him at all and see him as unpredictable. See everything in my prior post\u2014I have a much longer rationale for why Beijing wants Trump out of office. This trade war is a referendum on the U.S.-China relationship and its outcome will affect the next 10 years of U.S.-Sino relations. SO, if Xi won\u2019t sign Trump\u2019s \u2018get me reelected\u2019 deal, what is the Chinese play right now? Stalling. Xi needs to stall for time until Trump gets distracted by campaigning late next Spring. How best to do this? Participate in trade talks. Espouse flowery language, send delegations, engage in dialogue, reduce some tariffs on American imports (to China), paint yourself as the reasonable party (\u201cwe do not want to escalate\u201d). Don\u2019t cave to Trump, but draw the talks out into December, add a holiday hiatus, and then into January. If the Chinese can draw this out without escalation (which would hurt them more than Trump) into early Spring, 2020 campaign season will arrive and they know Trump will be too distracted to focus on them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(5) So, Trump won\u2019t get a \u2018great interim deal\u2019 and the Chinese will stall for time and deflect blame. So what should Trump do? I believe his most politically-successful path is to continue forward and escalate. There are several rationales for this. (5.1) A trade war that is \u2018stalled\u2019 and \u2018going nowhere\u2019 but still harming American consumers will hurt Trump. Imagine if he just \u2018tables\u2019 the trade war, people are going to think it was all for nothing. The optics would be horrible. It would be a great democrat attack line of his \u201cinsane and unpredictable wielding of executive power\u201d. If the trade war isn\u2019t producing tendies he needs it to be in-progress and evolving. (5.2) He can\u2019t give in at this point. First, China won\u2019t give a good enough deal to make it look like anything but capitulation. Giving in for a shitty deal right now makes him look like a pussy and people will ridicule him for throwing markets and alienating the world just to return to the status quo. Moreover, Trump has literally never capitulated when in a position of strength in a negotiation. We laugh about \u2018art of the deal\u2019 but the guy is consistent on some things. (5.3) Outside of farming communities (whose states he will still carry against any of the top polling democrats), the trade war has pretty broad bipartisan support. It is FAR less of a political dividing line than people thought it would be. People from Cali to NYC to know that China is \u2018wrong\u2019 on the issues and that we\u2019ve been stolen from for too long. Even Soros supports the trade war. Think on that. Trump, therefore, has political armor if the Chinese don\u2019t give him what he wants in November and he escalates. It would be hard for a democrat to argue against Trump on the issue, as it would be seen as coming off weak on China\u2014especially with the topics broad support. (5.4) Trump thrives on nationalism and conflict. The trade war provides him with an enemy he can blame, a boogeyman that he can attack with decent bipartisan support. He can drape himself in the flag\u2014a flag with decent bipartisan support\u2014and push a narrative of defending the U.S. from Chinese predation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(6) For these above reasons, Trump is (1) unlikely to get a reelection meal ticket and (2) likely to escalate. Over the next two weeks you\u2019ll see a lot of conciliatory and flowery language. People will be \u2018reasonable\u2019. This is all a show. It is theatre to convince the world that each side is \u2018right\u2019. Even during the trade talks you\u2019ll hear people continue to shape that narrative until\u2026drum roll please\u2026The Chinese are unreasonable! Who would have known! It will be such a shock, \u201cthey came here with false promises of looking to end the trade war but they offer nothing!\u201d. Trump will increase sanctions and go for the jugular. Xi can play the \u2018I don\u2019t want to escalate\u2019 card for so-long without a loss of face domestically. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(7) The Chinese will retaliate between early November and early December, with SPY hitting its floor between January and April 2020. China will want to take advantage of the political impact of a huge stock market hit before the holiday break. I think there is a decent chance they will play the single-use rare earth card (they halt rare earth exports to American companies\u2026but this only works once, as it leads to the development of related mines in Australia, southeast asia, and north Cali to take up the slack) sometime between December and January. That would have a huge impact for the year leading up to Trump\u2019s election, and the optics of it are \u201cgood\u201d for them in the sense that they are \u2018just\u2019 refusing to export to us, rather than them tariffing American imports. Even if some U.S. companies can indirectly get rare-earth, it will have a huge impact regardless and may be enough to tip consumer confidence into making the recession a reality. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(8) I think it is tempting to think \u201ctrump can\u2019t win in recession\u201d \u00e0 he will sign a deal. I think this ignores the alternative scenarios that I lay out above. I believe the political (U.S.) backdrop of the trade war, China\u2019s desire to boot Trump out of office, our stronger-position relative to China, and Trump\u2019s own persona, beliefs, trade-team, etc, all contribute towards this October deal possibility being unlikely. I think Trump may be able to win even with the U.S. in recession. Yeah, yeah, only one sitting president has gone to term 2 while in recession, but Trump has upturned a lot of conventional thinking. If he can turn the narrative on China, which I think is possible, I think game theory supports the idea of him willing to accept a big economic hit going into 2020. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is the play.  SPY 295 November 15th puts, SPY 285 December 31st puts, and SPY 270 January 17th puts, and SPY 260 March 20th puts. Also, SPXU, SSG, and as a wildcard, Lynas Corp (aussie rare earth company) LYSCF. Maybe JNUG. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*TD/DR the probability of an interim deal is low. Bears stay hard. The recent postponement of tariffs and flowery language of being open to an interim deal is unlikely to manifest in any actual deal.
