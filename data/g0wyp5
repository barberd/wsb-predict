{"id": "g0wyp5", "title": "What will be the next narrative to drive the market?", "selftext": "I'll keep this short and sweet: last two months have seen a couple overarching narratives from the market. Coronavirus concerns turned into fears as liquidity panic set in. Then the Fed stepped in to buy literally everything in sight along with repos, rate cuts, and business loans to support capital markets. \n\nWe're at an inflection point now where, at earnings season, the market hasn't given a shit about Q2 earnings over the last couple weeks (some TAers will note we're sitting near a 50% retracement level and have been holding it), only that liquidity fears have been settled and beervirus has peaked earlier than expected, implying the economy will reopen earlier than previously anticipated.\n\nSeveral narratives could unfold in the coming days/weeks: \n(1) Earnings season forces investors to realize companies have no visibility on their businesses. Investors realize there's no tangible plan to execute a reopening of the economy yet, and definitely not from the executive branch which has bungled the handling of the virus. And reopening is significantly harder than shutting down as it includes potential contact tracing, social distancing, rapid testing, etc. Many businesses will fold, and economic activity will be lighter than normal in Q3 and even then there could be rolling shutdowns if virus resurfaces en masse. Data bad with no lasting resolution in sight. \n\n(2) Fed buys equities, stonks go up. Bulls r fuk, for sure.\n\n(3) State and fed govt show they are able to handle outbreaks effectively, Trump doesn't fire Fauci, and economy reopens in June. Gilead's Remdesivir has approval by the summer and can be used as treatment while we await vaccines. Increased testing shows the virus is less deadly than thought, leading only vulnerable populations to limit their economic activity. Market doesn't care about Q2 earnings, or Q3 earnings. It wants to see that the economy reopens for good and if all goes well on that front, stonks keep going up steadily for the foreseeable future. \n\nThoughts?", "created_utc": 1586830722.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0wyp5/what_will_be_the_next_narrative_to_drive_the/", "is_self": true}
