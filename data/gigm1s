It is the standard of care in PPHN. NO also has several functions in the immune system, including antimicrobial activity (Killing or reduced replication of infectious agents viruses, bacteria, protozoa, fungi and helminths), anti-tumor activity (killing or growth inhibition of tumor cells), and tissue-damaging effect (necrosis or fibrosis of the parenchyma) to name a few.
