Stonks go up. AMD upgraded to BB credit from BB-\n\nDD courtesy of u/superdeeduperpower from r/amd_stock :\n\nTo put this into better context, BB is two notches away from what is considered \"investment grade\" (BB- -&gt; BB -&gt; BB+ -&gt; BBB-). BBB- is the first investment grade credit rating, so we are now within two steps instead of three towards not being considered a junk investment anymore!\n\n\nWhy does this matter for AMD? Some investment agencies won't touch our stock with a ten foot pole if our investment grade isn't high enough. This is likely why Lisa and Co. decided to start paying down debt before having a high EPS (which could have happened on the last quarter's earnings, if the debt was not paid down). Lisa is pushing the company as a whole forward slowly to open up those investment avenues. I'm hoping that now that the credit rating has been upgraded, we will likely see more investors move money into the stock, but it might take until a BBB- rating before anyone really starts thinking about it.", "created_utc": 1582331693, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7koo6/amd_should_go_up_credit_upgrade_at_sp/", "is_self": true}
