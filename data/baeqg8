But its mind blowing to me that people still short the stock? 12.43 %. 4-6 billions dollars lost from shorting the stock. Alone 3 billion from last spike that was fake with no growth and numbers.\n\nNow 2019 different story.\n\nPeople should short Nvidia imo. Mark my words Nvidia would plunged down to 99 dollars in 2 months time.\n\nBut plz tell me if you shorted AMD. Why and how much? If you calls AMD gow much why?
