Me. The David to Branson\u2019s Goliath. And as that rocket launches I\u2019ll swing those rocks at it with full force with One hand, while I buy as many OTM puts as I can with the other. When those rocks hit and that rocket comes down, I\u2019ll be gone with a pile of cash before anyone else has even opened up their RH account\n\nYou should all join me in buying puts and throwing rocks so we can make big bucks.", "created_utc": 1581340280, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f1q3b0/short_spce_by_throwing_rocks_at_the_launch/", "is_self": true}
