I think the fed is going to drop rates to zero or negative.  Golds gonna look good and we'll probably have another gold rush.   AUY was up at $20 in the last gold rush.  It's at $4.30 now.  I bought $5 calls for Jan 2022 at $0.85.  Probably a 50/50 shot of a 10:1 payout.   50% of the time it works 100% of the time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:   \n\n# A student whose classmates met with and touched VP Pence is now quarantined. On Friday, cadets at Sarasota Military Academy shook hands with Pence, who was visiting Sarasota for fundraiser. One cadet\u2019s mom had been in contact with a coronavirus patient.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7[**Fundamentals**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/search?q=flair_name%3A%22Fundamentals%22&restrict_sr=1) ", "created_utc": 1583285421.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fd5bcd/8_of_irans_parliament_tested_positive_for_bat/", "is_self": true}
