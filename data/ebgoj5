Since price got locked n loaded at $24.10 into the closed cuz of FDA, I figure I lose the 100 shares to assignment. This morning I woke up with the 100 shares still in my account, and my autistic ass watched it drop from $26 to $23.5 while recovering from the shock. Is ToS broken or am I the broken one?", "created_utc": 1576510775, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ebgoj5/amrn_wtf/", "is_self": true}
