{"id": "fku989", "title": "[DD] Bed Bath & Beyond is Over ($BBBY)", "selftext": "The following post outlines why I believe the coronavirus is the final nail in the coffin for Bed Bath & Beyond.\n\nFor a quick overview of the company: Bed Bath & Beyond is a retail company selling cleaning products, household goods, and toiletries (don't get erect over a similar sounding word to toilet paper quite yet, retards).\n\nIn recent years, its stock has taken a plunge. They've missed nearly every earnings report in recent quarters, leading to a swap in CEOs. In December, in the midst of the holiday season, **6 key executives left Bed Bath & Beyond**. The retailer warned that December and January store sales had slipped **5.4%**. Remember, this was before the coronavirus. The new CEO has been gunning for a recovery, but a 5% decline in sales during the holiday season, sprinkled with the coronavirus, is a recipe for bankruptcy.\n\nUnlike the airline, restaurant, and hotel industries which have been squeezed dry of shorting profits in recent weeks and yet will likely get bailed out by the gov, there's no chance for a bailout for fucking BB&B. The next earnings report is scheduled for **4/15,** and I have no doubt this will be the worst earnings report in the companies history. With the company's downward trajectory accelerated by the coronavirus, I am of the view that bankruptcy is highly likely. Their financials are trash, top-line, bottom-line, all lines are shit, and if the beer virus isn't eliminated within the next several quarters, I don't see any way in which this company will survive.\n\nFYI: Stores closed due to coronavirus. Online store still open. Let me know if you know anyone who uses the Bed Bath & Beyond online store instead of Amazon.\n\nTL;DR: Bed Bath and Beyond is beyond fucked. Possible bankruptcy and no bailout. Disastrous earnings report incoming.\n\n**BBBY $5p 4/17**", "created_utc": 1584555446.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fku989/dd_bed_bath_beyond_is_over_bbby/", "is_self": true}
