A month early. \n\nThis has been discussed over the last week or so in this sub but here is the official confirmation in their 8-K. \n\n\n\"The lock-up period is scheduled to end on March 23, 2020, which falls within the Company\u2019s quarterly blackout period that commences at the end of the day on March 7, 2020. Therefore, in accordance with the lock-up agreements with the underwriters, the lock-up period will end on February 23, 2020 and shares subject to the lockup period will be eligible to begin trading on February 24, 2020, which is ten trading days prior to the commencement of the Company\u2019s quarterly blackout period. The Company will also release the market standoff agreements when the lock-up period expires.\nThe Company estimates that, based on the number of shares of the Company's capital stock which as of January 31, 2020 are: (i) outstanding or (ii) subject to stock options that have or will be vested as of February 24, 2020, approximately 317.4 million shares of Class A common stock (including approximately 273.4 million shares of Class B common stock convertible into Class A common stock) may become eligible for sale in the public market at the open of trading on February 24, 2020, including (i) 3,448,275 shares of Class A common stock issued in the Private Placement and (ii) 86,206 shares of Class A common stock issued to the two directors of the Company in the IPO. This includes shares held by affiliates which are subject to volume and other restrictions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\"\n\nI would imagine this has contributed to the sell off during after hours.", "created_utc": 1580948428, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ezjh17/pton_slipped_a_finger_and_a_roofie_in_the/", "is_self": true}
