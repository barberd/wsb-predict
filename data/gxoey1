No more flipping my phone upside down and no more asking my wife's boyfriend for his phone charger.\n\nI thought I'd stop once I made all my $ back, but now I'm never leaving. Thought I would never post on reddit about this, but here I am, and I AM INCREDIBLY HAPPY. Love you guys.\n\nHAVE A GREAT WEEKEND!", "created_utc": 1591438524.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gxoey1/aal_gains_11k_to_95k_and_my_journey/", "is_self": true}
