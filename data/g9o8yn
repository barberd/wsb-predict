{"id": "g9o8yn", "title": "Tanker Earnings with Chart and Positions", "selftext": " Original Post got deleted because of no charts and no positions I guess, so here is the chart of the tanker rates for the last year. and here are some positions\n\ntnp 6/19, 9/18 5 and 7.5 \n\nasc 7/17 12.5\n\neurn 6/19 20\n\nTL;DR people think everyone knows about tankers.... people with money didn\u2019t do tanker math yet... I did math. Buy tankers.\n\nFor you all that think it\u2019s too late to get in the tankers, some of these companies are going to put up earnings numbers in Q2 that are 1/4-1/2 of their market cap.\n\nEURN will put up about 3.50eps- stock is 12.20\n\nTNK 7.50eps -25\n\nTNP 2.00 -4 (that\u2019s 50%)\n\nNAT 1- stock price anywhere from 4-20, at this point who knows\n\nDHT- 2.50 -8.30 (going to have a disappointing q1 because they got unlucky in the beginning of q1, as they said in their q4 conference call)\n\nFRO 2.50- stock 10.50\n\nAnd half the quarter is basically locked in because the ships are chartering for the first week of May at high rates. The day rates would have to crash to alter these projections. Even if rates went to 0 TNP still makes 1/4 of its market cap q2.\n\nThe product tanker guys, like stng and asc are even higher going forward, because their rates just jumped this past week. Just today, an LR2 (2 sizes smaller than a VLCC) now charters for more a day than a VLCC. Now this wasn\u2019t all quarter, but if it kept up, those rates would earn stng and asc (who own only MRs) closer to 80%-90% of their stock price every 90 days.\n\nLastly, every conference call these companies do, they let the analyst know what their average fleet TCE (day rate) is for the quarter to date. If you look at the analyst projections right now, they have not been updated yet. You are going to a get line of upgrades as the q1 conference calls end because of the monster numbers that the tankers have already put up in q2.\n\nTo show you how out of date the projections are, EURN has a q2 projection of 1.20.... they earned that in April.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c5ihggyhjkv41.jpg?width=1612&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8da5529219652de300b1f75c0c725e6b7a0cb49", "created_utc": 1588084315.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9o8yn/tanker_earnings_with_chart_and_positions/", "is_self": true}
