{"id": "el6xlm", "title": "Beyond Air XAIR DD", "selftext": "u/DrUNC83 mentioned this company in the daily discussion and I thought I'd take a look at it.\n\nI work in healthcare and there's a lot of money made using nitric oxide to treat pulmonary hypertension of the newborn in NICU's.  The problem is the hospital has to store the heavy tanks, replace the tanks, and if I remember correctly they have an expiration.  So if they're not used, they're out of luck.  Beyond Air has created a one-of-a-kind machine that creates nitric oxide from ambient air.  No tanks.  They're sitting at a market cap of 75M right now and FDA approval for their machine is supposed to happen this quarter.  Will it get approved? There has been ZERO SAEs during trials.  There is no reason the FDA doesn't approve this. Institutional holdings have increased as have insider buying in the last 3-6 months. \n\nThey're also trying to market toward disease processes that aren't normally treated with NO.  That could be huge for them.  Their trial out of Israel showed a decreased length of stay for patients with bronchiolitis.\n\nThe downside, if they do get approved sales are only likely to be around 300M.  They come with a proprietary filter that has to be replaced, so there's additional revenue but still your probably only looking at a 2-3 bagger max in the next year or two.  No option chain either.\n\nAnyways, thought I'd share.
