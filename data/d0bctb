It\u2019s a small play just because I don\u2019t like losing and want to learn before I start going in with more.\n\nI\u2019ve been trading stocks and forex for a living for a couples of years now, over the last week I\u2019ve been making a lot of plays on ULTA just due to the volatility and the easy money all except one went my way according to my technical analysis. \n\nThe bottom yesterday came in an area that has been a support the last year and a half. The bounce from this level was typically very quick as was shown with the climb yesterday and today. Due to this and the volatility along with the fact that the stock was oversold the sell off was a bit exaggerated, we are now in the perfect position for it to continue upwards. I\u2019m looking to get out above $240 but will be watching the 20 sma on the 1 minute to see when to truly get out.", "created_utc": 1567741168, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d0bctb/first_options_play_20_240_96_ulta_calls/", "is_self": true}
