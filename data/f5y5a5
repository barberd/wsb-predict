{"id": "f5y5a5", "title": "CAKE Earnings Tomorrow", "selftext": "Cheesecake Factory earnings are coming out tomorrow. I am feeling a little bearish on this stock so I suggest you autists go long.\n\nEPS estimate is $.60/share which is pretty much the same as a year ago, meaning no growth. Judging from past earnings reports estimates are typically pretty accurate and I could see them even achieving a small beat.\n\nMy bearish sentiment on this stock is that the restaurants under this banner are intrinsically tied to shopping malls (many anchored by Macy's stores which will be closing) which are getting destroyed by online retail.  \n\n\nThat being said, remember kids, being bear typically leads to less tendies.", "created_utc": 1582057639, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f5y5a5/cake_earnings_tomorrow/", "is_self": true}
