{"id": "g2zhb0", "title": "Taking stock of tanker stocks", "selftext": "Ladies and Autists, thank you so much for reading this post this morning. Now I\u2019ve travelled across half of my basement to be here and see about this post. Now I daresay some of you have heard some of the more extravagant rumors about what my plans are, so I just thought you\u2019d like to hear it from me. This is the account - it\u2019s no mystery.\n\nI\u2019m an oil man, ladies and autists. I have numerous tanker stocks across my brokerage accounts. I have many tankers storing many thousands of barrels per day. I like to think of myself as an oil man. And as an oil man I hope that you\u2019ll forgive just good oil-fashioned plain speaking:\n\nTwo weeks ago on April 5 I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fux17s/buy_tanker_stocks_if_you_like_tendies/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) some DD encouraging you all to invest in tanker stocks. Now those tanker stocks have [appreciated meaningfully](https://postimg.cc/BPq8gfPn), some by as much as 20%, which may tempt some of you to profit and return to your old ways of speculating on SPY puts. \n\nBut what I\u2019m trying here to do is invest. Yes I said it: *invest*. I know this is an unfamiliar concept to you all, but I promise that as a seasoned speculator and investor alike, both can generate substantial tendies. And these tanker stocks are an *investment*.\n\nIt\u2019s well known at this time that there\u2019s a shortage of oil storage. It\u2019s well reflected in the substantial contango exhibited in the futures market. It\u2019s well reflected in elevated day rates for VLCCs. And it\u2019s well reflected in DOE numbers showing record builds in crude inventory. But are tanker stocks fully pricing it in?\n\nI daresay they are not. The majority of these stocks are trading at mere 10-20% premium to their net asset value while day rates continue to soar. Where before these tankers earned a mere $20k/day transporting oil, many are earning well above $200k/day. I expect these tankers to achieve day rates in excess of $100k/day for most of the 2Q and into the 3Q. \n\nNow I\u2019m no mathematician, but if the average VLCC ranges in value from $15m to $90m brand new, let\u2019s say for an average of $50m, and these VLCCs are earning perhaps $100k/day for 90 days, that\u2019s $9m in revenue. In one quarter. \n\nYet the average *sell side analyst* - if you still pay attention to any of them... is reluctant to raise their (edit) day rate estimates for VLCC companies beyond $40k-$50k / day for the 2Q and beyond. How come? Because they\u2019re pussies. And having earnings estimates that imply 100%+ upside would seem *unreasonable* and attract too much attention from management, even if they know it\u2019s quite plausible.\n\nSo I reiterate. I\u2019m an oil man. I own many tankers storing many barrels of oil. And I\u2019ll continue to do so until the excess earnings is paid to me in the form of substantial price appreciation, perhaps through buybacks, or through  special dividends. DHT, FRO, TNP, and STNG remain among my favorites with EURN and TNP now my top picks.
