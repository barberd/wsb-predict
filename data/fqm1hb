{"id": "fqm1hb", "title": "Straddles Every Friday", "selftext": "Sup autists, looking at the guy who turned 900 to 18k gave me an idea. Since Friday EOD moves are so insane these days, why not buy 0DTE straddles at 3pm, and cash out at 3.55? Options near EOD trade for around 0.01 + Stocks swing either a lot up or down near Friday EOD, so one side of your straddle will just expire worthless & the other side will print. Sounds foolproof to me. Planning on trying this on Friday.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nposition: SPY 200p 15/5  **\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b**", "created_utc": 1585408643.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqm1hb/straddles_every_friday/", "is_self": true}
