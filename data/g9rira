{"id": "g9rira", "title": "INSM Unusual Options Activity", "selftext": "I have been seeing more and more of these posts pop up lately and I wanted to give it a try. I have been playing around with my scanner settings and this one popped up and caught my eye.\n\nAdmittedly I have not done a thorough deep dive yet, but I wanted to post this and see what people thought.\n\n[Options Chain and Level 2 Data](https://imgur.com/a/qXO2W4z)\n\n**TL,DR: INSM 5/15 $16 / $19P**\n\n**COMPANY BACKGROUND**\n\nInsmed Inc is a global biopharmaceutical company transforming the lives of patients with serious and rare diseases. The company's first commercial product is ARIKAYCE (amikacin liposome inhalation suspension), approved in the US for the treatment of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) lung disease as part of a combination antibacterial drug regimen for adult patients with limited or no alternative treatment options. The company's earlier-stage clinical pipeline includes INS1007, a novel oral reversible inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase 1 with therapeutic potential in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis and other inflammatory diseases, and INS1009, an inhaled formulation of a treprostinil prodrug that may offer a differentiated product profile for pulmonary arterial hypertension.\n\n**OPTIONS ACTIVITY**\n\nThe spreads on these are very wide, so it's not something I would normally even look at. But, the big blocks of puts that went through make it seem like someone knows something. Earnings are on the 30th and I couldn't find any information on any of their drugs with news pending, so it could be a pure earnings play. On both strike prices, open interest sits at 5 and 22 with the volume at 5005 and 5067.  Indicating that there was significant opening of positions.\n\n**In Closing**\n\nThis is just my attempt to try and make sense of an irrational market. I would love to hear from much smarter people on their thoughts. As of now I have zero positions, but I might try to buy a few and see if anything comes of it.", "created_utc": 1588094948.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9rira/insm_unusual_options_activity/", "is_self": true}
