I was on the call for an hour with the rep. We were making progress. Kept being put on hold till eventually it went silent. And I was on the phone for so long I figured maybe he was doing something & and I didn\u2019t want to hang up and waste all the time I had spent waiting.\n\nAfter 20 mins I started saying hello? Again, hello?, HELLO? \n\nAll of a sudden a new voice says back Hello?? Who is this?\n\n\u201cUm is this TD Ameritrade?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo buddy you have the wrong number sorry\u201d \n\nHe then hangs up ending my call. I\u2019m just so damn confused at this point. So I double check the number and it\u2019s 100% correct on their website 1-(800) number. So I call back\n\nThis time I hear the man that hung up on me like assisting someone saying \u201cokay let\u2019s get that before we get started here\u201d meanwhile I also hear the automated answering machine trying to direct my call. It\u2019s lagging and cutting in and out. So I just hang up. \n\nIdk what fucking dimension I connected to but my entire knowledge of how phones work is now called into serious question.", "created_utc": 1584978329.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fnm3i8/shitpost_brief_story_time_of_something_that_blew/", "is_self": true}
