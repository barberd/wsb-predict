Simple, figure out the next currency in out post-apocalyptic future which is probably ammunition. Rather than going short, I'm hedging my bets by buying ammo and buying dips. \n\nIf the market collapses, all my money is worthless anyway and I have great trade value in my ammunition. Don't get the meme calibers, just straight 5.56 NATO and maybe some 300AAC. Why 300 Blackout? The .300 cartridge is shot by only the most autistic gun nuts and preppers who likely already have their bug-out supplies while they are readying for the boogaloo. Those rounds are in high demand and expensive (at least until Wolf releases their steel-cased in March). \n\nIf this all passes, then the dips I bought will be tasty and I have more ammo to go shoot at the range. If it doesn't pass, then I've got subsonic ammo ready to go so I don't blow my ears out while killing zombies in my house.\n\nPS, if you haven't bought a bug-out bag yet, you probably should.", "created_utc": 1582803902, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/faaw9f/covid19_and_how_to_play_both_sides/", "is_self": true}
