Are they just gonna hold this dogshit on their books until the end of time?  What about all the junk bonds and ETFs BlackRock has been buying up?  Where do these go?  In an ideal world, they would slowly be introduced back into the market once it's \"standing on it's own\" again, whatever the fuck that means. \n\nExcept I don't think this is possible. [From 2008 to 2014, the Fed radically increased their balance sheet](https://thesoundingline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Balance-Sheet-of-the-Federal-Reserve-Total-Assets-1914-through-May-6th-2020.png) and only after **9 years** were they even able *to begin* to sell off a fraction of these holdings. \n\nNow here they are *again* holding the fucking bag that's looking to be multiples bigger.  If they even mention the possibility of selling this dogshit, the market is gonna crash.  So what's the plan? Is there even a plan?  I haven't seen this mentioned once and I'm hoping the wsb hivemind can soothe my fears.  \n\nMy personal opinion is they will inflate the mother of all bubbles to stave off a debt market collapse for possibly a few years which will crush all the bears\u2019 hopes.  By then, the balance sheet will be around 10-12 trillion and rates will be a 25 bps negative.  At this point, the Fed will *actually be out of ammo*.  When the next disruption hits, I'm not really sure what they can do from there.  That's when the mother of all crashes happens and it's probably guns and ammo time.  For a brief moment you'll be rich on your shitty RH account until you're gunned down shortly after by roving gangs.  The level of irresponsibility we're seeing is truly unrivaled.  They are playing with our economy like it literally can't go tits up which makes me fear for the worst.  Or maybe i'm retarded like [this guy](https://media3.giphy.com/media/G8ebH5TOE3pde/source.gif).\n\nWait for us to hit 315 and then go in on some SPY 180 P 2022 strike", "created_utc": 1589258415.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gi47fx/whats_the_feds_end_game_here/", "is_self": true}
