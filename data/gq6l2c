Archer's drinking philosophy is literally the Fed's Monetary Policy.  \n\n\nThe Fed hasn't been able to unwind its balance sheet since 2008. Every time they tried the market lost its shit. They can't let the market crash since while \"the market isn't the economy\" it is the pension of the country. So while the Fed isn't technically controlled by the White House they do everything to keep the markets from crashing because nobody likes being dragged outside and killed in front of their family by an angry mob who collectively lost 40 years worth of savings due to your policy decisions. This was true for Obama, this is true for Trump, it will be true for Biden or God Emperor Trump's barely living corpse (ALL HAIL THE GOD-EMPEROR OF MANKIND).  \n\n\nNow I listen to Macro voices because I have an engineering and a biochem degree so I need a place to learn that contango isn't a fruit. One of the guests, amid a whole bunch of quackery, pointed out that we get diminishing returns on debt with low growth even with ultra low interest rates. So to roll the debt over we need to take on even more debt and so on and so forth. This means in the next corona induced downturn the FED will need to print even more. How much? I dont know but if the printed 3 years worth of GDP, I wouldn't be surprised.  \n\n\nCurrently all of that money printing doesn't matter since demand has plummeted across the globe (deflation is caused by a decline in  aggregate demand and nobody is buying shit atm), but once the rest of the world has COVID handled and the US is still trying to get people to stop licking Walmart toilets then we are in for a bit of pickle.  (The US is going to get a seriously nasty wave since in places like Italy their \"opening up\" is our \"lock down\". We haven't taken it seriously and now the virus is endemic in rural America so we either shutdown the entire country Wuhan style, get a vaccine, or get 3 million deaths to achieve \"heard immunity\". Without one of those unpalatable options look for multiple major waves and shutdowns in the US and places like Canada barring entry to US citizens.)\n\nDeflation will continue in the US while inflation will occur internationally. This might mean big problems for US denominated debt as it will be more expensive to service it and the fed will have to print even more money to do it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat will this mean? I don't know. there is  a reason I chose the Discussion flair and not the DD flair.\n\n  \nDISCUSS!\n\nTLDR; Maybe Archer can stave of the hangover or maybe liver failure will kill him?  \n\n\nPosition: Cash gang (much reduced) and some biotech stuff that's too small for this sub", "created_utc": 1590391694.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gq6l2c/im_scared_if_i_stop_all_at_once_the_cumulative/", "is_self": true}
