Let me explain.\n\n# EDUMACATION TIME\n\nWhat is inflation? Inflation is the sustained increase in the price level in goods and services. Inflation is derived from a general price index, and in the US, from the consumer price index. Knowing that inflation is an outcome, not a set policy is very important. Inflation is a measurement after the fact, much like your technical astrology indicators. (\\*\\*ps, use order flow in your TA you wizards\\*\\*)\n\nHOWEVER, the actual act of buying bundles of these loans does not directly impact inflation.\n\nNow what is Gauge symmetry? Gauge symmetry is a function of math and theoretical physics that can be applied to finance models. What a gauge is, is a measurement. Gauge symmetry is when the underlying variable of something changes, however, we do not observe that variable change.\n\nA great example of this is if you and a friend are moving, and your friend is holding a box of tendies. The box is a cube, equal on all sides. If you turn away for a moment and she rotates the cube 90 degrees while you are not looking, and you look back - you would have no idea the cube was rotated. There was a very real change in the position of the cube in relation to space-time. Your friend acted on it. But you didn't measure it, in fact it would be impossible for you to determine if the box was changed at all if you weren't observing it. That movement of the box where you didn't observe it, is called gauge transformation and happens literally more then JPow fucks my mom in quantum physics. The object observably exactly the same even though it is not physically the same. The act of it existing as an observably the same box is gauge symmetry - it is by observation symmetrical.\n\nWhy this is important, is that fiat money doesn't have any absolute meaning. The value of $1 is arbitrary. furthermore, Inflation is a Guage symmetry. Inflation has no real impact on the real value of the underlying goods and services, but rather serves as a metric to measure the shift of value across a timeline.\n\nWhen JPow starts pluggin' your mom along with all these balance sheets, there is a gauge symmetry event happening. The money he is printing is entering the system (gauge transformation), this isn't an issue if all pricing against the USD get shifted equally, however, the market is not accounting for this money because we don't have real-time data on what is being applied where, we only get a slow drip in terms of weekly and monthly reports. WE HAVE OUR EYES CLOSED. This is a gauge symmetry event.\n\nWhen this happens in real terms, the market becomes dislocated from its real value price. Well how do we know there is a dislocation?\n\n\"YoU JuSt SaId tHe UnDeRlYiNg VaLuE iZ AbStRaCkKt HuRr QE aNd MaRkEtS Iz ComPlEx ReAd A TeXtBuK AbOuT FrAcTiOnAl ReSErVe BanKiNg YoU NeRd.\" - \\*\\*anyone rationalizing the bull run\\*\\*\n\nWe can look at Forex you fish.\n\nUSD lives in a bubble. The Yen is in a bubble, the RMB is in a bubble, and we exchange with each other. the Jap central bank has little effect on the CPI index (cost of goods and services) of the US. If the Yen prints a gazillion dollars, the USD is not effected EXCEPT in its exchange rate. YEN:USD would see a sizeable differential the more Yen is printed and vise-versa.\n\nSo NOW instead of JPow getting away with plowing your girlfriend, we can catch the bitch.\n\nInstead of looking at the gauge transformation at face value and then giving up because it is symmetrical output, we can look and see if this gauge symmetry carries over to the foreign exchange market. Well guess what happens when you look at the value of the USD against foreign currencies.\n\nConsistent uncertainty during the fed operations. Meaning the market of banks that partake in FX swaps don't know where to spot the USD. Generally a very very bad thing.\n\n[Value of the USD to Euro 2017-2020, notice the slow decline, then the chaos at the end ](https://preview.redd.it/6frfj9eoa2s41.png?width=2543&format=png&auto=webp&s=e256dc53308b55077366e86630b386c8ed592a67)\n\nAbove is the value of the USD to Euro, notice the sloping decline. The dollar has been growing weaker since 2017. At the end you see our present issues, lets #ENHANCE\n\n[USD to Euro, January 2020 to Present](https://preview.redd.it/p5cwgnf4b2s41.png?width=2532&format=png&auto=webp&s=26b008e733898dd9b69ad442e284d63ee23670ea)\n\nWhen you see those spikes, those are days in between Fed action. The value of the US goes up when the fed doesn't print because people aren't spending. Non-spending is a deflationary event and has a direct impact on the CPI. However, each drop when you line up the dates, was a date of Fed spending.\n\nLets look outside of the Eurozone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[This is the RMB to USD. Yes China manipulates, but look at the end of the graph](https://preview.redd.it/3ilhrdm7c2s41.png?width=2171&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e235f475bf7272b1f15311c8eaa830cd88759d9)\n\nChina manipulated rates early in 2018 however you can see the steady incline upward towards the of 2018. More specifically, lets look at it since December.\n\n[RMB value against USD, January to Now](https://preview.redd.it/hx4fuvpjc2s41.png?width=2545&format=png&auto=webp&s=8bcf165ffbead91562b05c6fd1ae21246118d927)\n\nYou Can see the Chinese RMB has been gaining steam since December, even with Chinese production falling off a cliff all through this pandemic.\n\n# What this rain man level autism means for the economy.\n\nLooking across the board at Forex we can see the USD having a schizo panic attack jumping up and down like me at a mathematics lecture.\n\nBut what does all this gauge BDSM and shit have to do with the markets? Well it shows 1 of 3 things are occuring.\n\n1. The fed is printing money to offset deflationary pressures of the economy being fuk for the past month, and therefore all this printing is offset by the loss of liquidity throughout the system and we are all retared. (SECRET: THIS IS WHAT ALL THE INSTITUTIONS THINK IS HAPPENING AND WE WILL ALL BE FINE.)\n2. The deflationary event is overplayed, and JPow just is nailing his coffin together. This would result in long term hyperinflation similiar to the Weimar republic. The only hedge against this is to load up on strong currency that do not manipulate and have enough distance from US markets that they can have some safety (ironically the Ruble is the safest currency. Low link to the USD and not influenced by China, and on discount rn)\n3. The gauge transformation is actually not as severe as they are blurting out, the fed does not pass go, does not actually print 10 Trillion dollars, and this was all a marketing ploy to not get Trump involved and prop markets. In this case, the real deflationary event is real, the USD red rockets harder then my cock and we end up market-wise at a very high asset price in relation to real value. This one is most dangerous because it increases the real value of debt and has mass dislocation between real value and market cap. You took debt at a fixed interest rate and a fixed principal, this would cause the biggest GUH in history when all of a sudden you are $100 million in debt and your revenue was $50 million a year ago, but now is only $25 million. That $100 million in debt is still $100 million and now you have a credit crisis because past values of money were inflated. This spirals into a large scale solvency crisis of any company utilizing current growth methodology (levering up to your tits in debt)\n\nIn only 1 of these 3 scenarios do we see any sort of \"good\" outcome? That would be the offset of deflationary pressures.\n\nIt is very important to understand that inflation is only a measurement, and itself does not denote value of real goods and services.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOption 1 of a print fiesta that works (something similar to 1981-82) seems possible. A similar environment and reaction occured in the early 80s when the government brute-forced a bull run using these same offset theorems but in that situation, Volker at the fed had interest rates at 21.5% and had 20% to come down to stimulate the inflationary reaction.\n\nLong term this would just lever up more debt and expanded the real wealth gap over time because we kicked the can down the road another 15 years. If that happens again socioeconomically I don't see capitalism surviving (yeah Im on my high horse get over it). This is the option that many fiscal policymakers and talking heads abide by and the reason why the markets are green. However, it is really just kicking it down the road and expanding real wealth inequality. You think Bernie Sanders is bad, wait until homes cost $3million dollars in Kentucky and AOC Jr comes around.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf we get option 2, we see hyperinflation and we turn into Zimbabwe, which is great, I've always wanted to see Africa. Long term we could push interest rate back to 1980 Volker levels and slowly revalue the US against real value commodities already pegged to the USD like oil. This would be a short term shock but because of international reliance on the USD system, we could slowly de-lever this inflation over 2-3 years and be back to normal capacity although the markets would blow their O-ring. Recession yes, but no long term depression.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf we get option 3, the worst long term option in my opinion, basically any company with any revolver line drawn down when that hits is going to go under, private equity won't touch it with a 20ft stick because cashflows couldn't possibly handle the debt on the end of the lever, and we see mass long term unemployment. The only way out of the spiral of option three is inflationary pressure from the fed+government, but because we are already so far down the rabbit hole at the current moment there's no fucking way we could print another 10 trillion. USD treasuries couldn't handle the guh and we would essentially be functionally forced into a long term (7-10 year) depression because nothing anyone could do would delever the value of the dollar. This would result in the long term collapse of the United States as a world power and would render us like Russia in 1991.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for coming to my ted talk.", "created_utc": 1586558184.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fyqkto/inflation_gauge_symmetry_and_the_big_guh/", "is_self": true}
