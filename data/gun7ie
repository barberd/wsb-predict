And I'm aware of a few more that I'm sitting out (PD)\n\nThe next tech play on my radar is ORCL, reporting on 6/18. Zoom is now using Oracle cloud, so I expect the forward guidance to be good. I'll sell before earnings if there is a run-up, and I'll hold if there is not. It's down on the day and I consider this a good entry opportunity. \n\nAre there any tech names reporting next week? I want to get in a little early before the big run up.", "created_utc": 1591027328.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gun7ie/the_next_stops_on_the_tech_earning_tendie_train/", "is_self": true}
