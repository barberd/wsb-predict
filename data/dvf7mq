{"id": "dvf7mq", "title": "Trading life", "selftext": "Hello brothers, \n\nWhen I first started trading this august, I was very hesitant and traded with very small amounts in blue chip companies such as tesla, apple, alibaba etc. and I was able to make around $1000(mostly from apple, bought around 3k worth of apple and held for nearly 3weeks). I started with $5000 and with this amount I knew trading individual stocks weren\u2019t taking me anywhere since it took me about 3months to make that $1000. So I started learning more about TA and other instruments which yield better returns, I then made nearly $8000 trading indices within 24hrs and thought I was unstoppable. Of course being a beginner that I am, I took riskier positions and nearly lost it all.\n\nI would like to get tips and strict rules that proficient traders always abide by when trading (habits, risk tolerance, position size etc.) and what did you guys do when you were all newbies?\n\nThank you.", "created_utc": 1573588146, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dvf7mq/trading_life/", "is_self": true}
