{"id": "furwfh", "title": "Oil to crash again", "selftext": "Thur/Friday Brent jumped from 22 to 30.5 thanks to Trumps tweets about fixing the crisis with an OPEC meeting.\n\nHere is what we know:\n\n\\-Oil supply is expected to beat demand by 30mbd (million barrels per day) in April\n\n\\-Trump wants Saudi and Russia to cut 10mbd\n\n\\-If Saudi and Russia cut 10mbd thats half their total output and twice what OPEC has ever cut\n\n\\-Saudi and Russia are sick of doing the cuts while USA take their market share\n\n\\-Saudi and Russia want USA to join in on the cuts\n\n\\-It is illegal for USA or its companies to join forces to cut and raise prices intentionally\n\n\\-Even if they cut 15mbd that will still leave 15mbd over supply\n\n\\-Even if they cut 15mbd that will only buy an extra 6 weeks until world oil storage if full\n\nSo why did price jump so much? I think its a dead cat bounce or momentum traders. It will most likely crash again to 20 and once storage nears capacity even as low as 10\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit - a point I missed too, 05APR Sauidis release their the May oil prices, being the day before the meeting it will prob be very cheap to hurt everyone more and act as a bargaining chip", "created_utc": 1585998503.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/furwfh/oil_to_crash_again/", "is_self": true}
