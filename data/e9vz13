Made 5K on them &amp; come Monday I decided to sell the ITM calls and roll them into OTM calls. For some dumb fucking reason I grabbed 5 - 01/24 232.50C and 15 - 12/27 235C. I guess I wanted more time to hit my lower strike price just in case shit went bad. GUH. Overall I put about 22K into these bad bitches, I mean come on, if that shit show ULTA can smash their earnings then there is absolutely no way LULU can go tits up. To add insult to injury my penny stock decided to dip a bit today adding and additional 8K to my total loss. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/1RymK9O", "created_utc": 1576195472, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e9vz13/becky_aka_lulu_fucked_me_good_29k_loss/", "is_self": true}
