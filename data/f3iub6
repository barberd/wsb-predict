I just wanted some people to share my story with. Very few friends (1), no family. I hope that it's not the end of the road for me. You guys can be my friends too. I did enjoy my time spending here.\n\nI'm genuinely somewhere on the assburger spectrum. Have experience in a few graduate level work. PhD in physics and masters level experience in two other STEM fields. Got hired by an AI consulting firm with 100k salary. Worked for a year or so there, saved up about 30k. I was the best at the office! Delivering results after results and my superiors loved me.  Even got a raise near the end of last year. Annual review was stellar.\n\nThat changed when my superiors handed me a project that made no sense at all. They have no relevant experience, and they wouldn't listen when I told them that it is not going to work. They must have signed a contract with clients. I had no say in what projects are feasible even when I have the experience. I tried to get something to work - but in the end they just told me not to do it. Note that I still got a raise at the end of year review. \n\nThe manager misunderstood some key concepts and I tried to tell him. He doubled down and pretty much called me an idiot (note that I had 10 years experience more than him). I stopped going to work social functions. I think that this is the reason why I got fired. There was no warnings what so ever. I don't even know what I did wrong. \n\nMy first bet was on BYND put $6000 for Feb 25 125c just a day after it went parabolic early January. It went so high! I think it reached a price of $125 in two days, and my $6000 turned into 24k. I was a moron and didn't sell. Only panic sold when it was at $12000. Making a 6k profit. I thought I really cracked the stock market with my TA then. And I kept making OTM bets like that. I thought BYND was a good stock so I kept buying calls on it. \n\nThen the beer flu happened. Everything just dropped, and I sold everything,  taking a 80% loss. Account down to about 6k. RIP. But I'm determined to build it back up. Did some researches on meme stocks everyone's talking about and found out SPCE. Everything seemed to click, many catalysts in the near future, and Richard Branson just won't die in a rocket crash. I put everything in and it's at about 10-12k. I shared what I found with WSB and everyone seemed to like it, I'm glad that I was able to help you guys print money.

Too much political correctness in AI, I was actually trying to look around for another job for a few months. Even given my experience and credential, it was very hard to get an offer. I guess being being an aspie can't really bond with the interviewers during the short times spent in interviews. I'll talk to my personal trainer next week and see if I can find a job as a trainer. At least I will be able to help guys get healthier, which is a much more meaningful job than making sure AI's aren't racist.\n\nIf you get through this far, thank you. I really appreciate. I just wanted to share this with someone. Peace.", "created_utc": 1581635813, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3iub6/got_fired_im_glad_that_i_was_able_to_do_something/", "is_self": true}
