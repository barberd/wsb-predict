{"id": "bhu1fm", "title": "0 DTE options", "selftext": "Hello everyone I currently trade the SP500 and Nasdaq futures but want to dabble into  the ETF options such as SPY and QQQ. I primarily hold trades for about 30 minutes and am looking to catch a dollar move on the underlying(SPY). I\u2019m wondering which options would provide the most leverage and gain for scalping. How far out should my 0 DTE strikes be? Does theta constantly decrease each minute? How much percent of a gain should I expect if I buy a 0 0DTE SPY call and the SPY rises a dollar since I bought the contract? Thanks!", "created_utc": 1556328446, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bhu1fm/0_dte_options/", "is_self": true}
