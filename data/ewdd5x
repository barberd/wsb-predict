I'm happy to announce that it's finished and available on Amazon.  Currently it's only on Kindle but it will be available on print as well within 72 hours:\n\n[LINK TO AMAZON](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084CZKCSP/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=wallstreetbets&amp;qid=1580421607&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sr=1-1)\n\nThe book basically blames grown ups for creating such a fun, massive, and legal casino where everyone can play.  And of course, the entire book is accompanied by stories from all of you throughout the years.  Some of which you probably remember and some of which you may not.   \n\nI wanted to share a PDF with you to include a free sample but the Terms of Service explicitly prohibit this, however you can read the first chapter or two for free right from the amazon store.  I encourage you to do so.\n\nu/haupt91 got a chance to read it and had this to say:\n\n&gt; I'm a little over half way through. I gotta tell you dude. I don't bullshit and I'm not gonna kiss your ass - but this is fucking great. The Jesse Livermore quote, the way the book is structured. The story-telling component in the beginning and the angle. It's really fucking good. I hope you release it right and have a gameplan.", "created_utc": 1580422396, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ewdd5x/wallstreetbets_how_boomers_made_the_worlds/", "is_self": true}
