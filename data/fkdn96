I also expect that as the lock downs are lifted and as things open back up, guess what all the people who\u2019ve been stuck cooped up in their homes will want to do ASAP....travel! And that might just be to local bars and restaurants but everyone is staying home, many companies are compensating, sometimes with 125% salary, so people won\u2019t be shy about travel, at the very least about taking taxis. \n\nAlso, according to RH, fair value is $44.00. Currently dancing around $18-$20, it\u2019s a steal and call prices are super cheap. $36 strike for September 18 is still less than a dollar (my position). 6 months from now (August), I think people will be back to going out to bars and things will be in near full swing. Recovery to January levels might not be that fast, but REGARDLESS, the value of your position WILL go up if you buy now. I don\u2019t believe UBER will dip below $17 at any point. If it does, it won\u2019t be for long. \n\nMy \u201creasonable man\u201d theory/2 cents. \n\nBring on the hatred.", "created_utc": 1584481115.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkdn96/shitty_ubertravel_dd/", "is_self": true}
