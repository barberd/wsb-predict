The stock normally rebounds a little bit in the following days and I close out my options. Example: CRM when they bought Tabelau. Stock tanked, bought options, a week-ish later sold them for profit. Most calls I buy are several months out.", "created_utc": 1563301549, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ce0xla/what_tools_do_you_use_to_gather_dd_on_a_company/", "is_self": true}
