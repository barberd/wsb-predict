{"id": "fay3yg", "title": "$NIO Earnings 3/3", "selftext": "NIO seems to have been propped up recently by a vague $1.4 billion bailout by local Chinese gov't. Before this news they were known for missing payroll, having similar cash infusions get nixed from billions down to what amounts to nothing when compared to the amount of cash they burn every quarter. Now pair this with Chinese auto market performing horribly before Coronavirus, and now being slaughtered as workers / production has been all but halted over the past few months. Yet NIO continues to hold near $4, quickly rebounding anytime it falls below, ignoring both US and Chinese index trends, it doesn't add up. I'm expecting the rug to be pulled on naive investors Monday morning and will provide sources below:\n\n\n$1.4 bil Bailout - https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nio-soars-china-government-deal-134501507.html\n\n\nMissing payroll - https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-13/struggling-nio-delays-salary-payments-because-of-coronavirus\n\nBurning through cash - https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/01/26/nio-sales-are-strong-but-cash-is-dwindling.aspx\n\nBurning vehicles - https://www.google.com/search?q=nio+car+fire&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk01icO9uU9QvYSNjg1ZqbX1wG3y0Og:1582909837285&amp;source=lnms&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjahMDU3vTnAhVlUd8KHb47CAwQ_AUICygC&amp;biw=1504&amp;bih=892&amp;dpr=1.5\n\nMany upset employees on glassdoor - https://i.imgur.com/ZKBh3WV.png\n\nChinese auto market - https://www.marklines.com/en/statistics/flash_sales/salesfig_china_2019", "created_utc": 1582910439, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fay3yg/nio_earnings_33/", "is_self": true}
