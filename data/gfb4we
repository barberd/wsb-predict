{"id": "gfb4we", "title": "TSN: Perry, IA Plant", "selftext": "Tyson is really dropping the ball, but it currently riding on the hopes of reopening and fear mongering a meat shortage. Sadly, it appears to be working for Tyson, but they are having issues with reopening. For example, in [Dakota City](https://siouxcityjournal.com/news/local/tyson-delays-reopening-of-dakota-city-beef-plant-to-wait-for-covid-19-test-results/article_45e0057b-6d56-50e0-8346-d5349a8bec08.html), they are delaying reopening it, and it is their biggest beef plant.\n\nTyson closed the Perry plant two weeks ago for cleaning and testing. They confirmed 700 cases, or [58%](https://theperrynews.com/fifty-eight-percent-of-perry-tyson-workers-test-positive/), of their employees have covid-19 a couple days ago.\n\nI have some friends who are contractors that were quarantined for two weeks and went back to work at Perry earlier this week. One of their guys got a high fever and were sent home to get tested. Despite my friend and his crew possibly getting covid-19, they aren't sending any of the engineers or other contractors who were in contact with my friend's crew home to get tested. Hell, other contractors are starting a shit storm about not wanting to go home and finishing their work despite being exposed. (Fucking dumb)\n\nBesides production running at a fraction of what it used to be, the plant is getting way behind on projects that have serious deadlines. All in all, some contractors who are working at the plant, even when it is shut down, will continue working despite being sick themselves.\n\nTyson is trying to contain the spread within their employees, but they have no real control over the contractors they have hired. I'm talking about the Perry plant having dozens and dozens of crews.\n\nDisclaimer: I closed all of my short positions of Tyson after earnings, but I plan on re-entering a short position on the day when I find out either the Dakota City, NE; Perry, IA; or Storm Lake, IA plants close again.\n\nTLDR: Tyson Plant in Perry, IA has 58% of their employees infected. Contractors are getting sick and are attempting to continue working, potentially spreading covid-19. No positions because the time isn't right.\n\nEdit: Tyson is reopening the Dakota City plant, despite no longer reporting the number of employees infected with covid-19 since April 30th.
