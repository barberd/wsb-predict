From my Nuke-proof (patent pending) hotel room, the city appears to me as though dreamt. The buildings smolder, ash falling as snow on an icy December morning many years ago. Where once people roamed, heaps of incinerated bankers and melted piles of robot rest.\n\nAll empires come and go - I'm not naive enough to think this Rome would live forever. In the end, the realists were made to look like fools, and the raving mad men and sooth seers won the day. We destroyed ourselves. To trade with each other nuclear warheads as though they were wampum. The first world is no longer. Berlin, LA, Paris, Moscow, Beijing, Tokyo. Merely ruins.\n\nA tear streams down my cheek as I watch over what remains. The remaining 5% in the sparingly untouched pockets of the rural West would be required to take up the task of building it all back up themselves. Could they do it - who might say. I reached for my coffee and pulled the mug close to my face, right under my nose, letting the steam veil my vision and sooth my scarred face.\n\n... And then a spark of excitability within me.... My puts.... Purchased two years before fallout. The first nuclear attack had already hit Berlin, and I said to hell with timing the market. If currency still exists two years from now, I'll be richer than the tech tycoons of the 20s.\n\nI wondered just how much the market had dropped since I purchased 8,000 of those SPY 15,000p contracts. About three years ago, SPY had cleared 30k - the bull run from DT's first term had ripped for decades, but alas, Rome must die. Currency began to lose its societal place after the DC attack anyway.\n\nI swiped my iPhone 73 RSXL and punched in my code to get into Robinhood...\n\nRed?\n\nIt couldn't be. My contracts..... $.01? How? I pressed SPY to get a read on where it was trading. I couldn't believe my eyes. I lost my grip on my phone, and it fell to the ground, cracking the screen.\n\n850,000? How could it be? How? Who was even trading SPY? The world was ash?\n\nI picked up my phone and swiped through the shards of broken glass. I pulled up MarketWatch, for a scruple of insight....\n\n\"BREAKING: NUCLEAR FALLOUT TO CONTINUE INTO THE NEXT 300 YEARS, ONLY PREDICTED ONE MILLION HAVE SURVIVED IN EUROPE - APPL, MSFT, AND NFLX AGREE TO IMPLEMENT INFINITE QUANTITATIVE EASING....\n\n...\n\n*Bullish*\"\n\nI reached for the window handle.\n\n\nTLDR: SBUX 75p 4/24", "created_utc": 1587684544.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6xg2f/the_year_is_2067/", "is_self": true}
