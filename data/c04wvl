Days before announcement?", "selftext": "TLDR: How do you play earnings?\n\nEg:\n\nToday\u2019s Thursday. \nFake Stock trading @ ~$100.\nEarnings after hours today. \nOptions expire every Friday. \nStrike prices at every $1.00\n\n1. Do you play straddle or strangle?\n2. If strangle, how wide?\n3. How many DTE do you play?\n4. How many days before the earnings call do you enter your position?\n5. How do you evaluate which companies are worth entering? (Eg: PLAY and BYND had big swings after earnings, so those would\u2019ve been excellent positions).\n\n6. And last but not least, has this actually worked?\n\n\nAs some examples of my own plays, as someone with only a few hundred in, I\u2019ve tried buying wide strangles with +/- 30% stock movement, where the premiums are like 0.03, with the hopes one of them jumps by like 1,000+%... \n\nAnd I do that with like 5-7 companies per week, entering only about a day before the announcement (sometimes an hour or so later), with moderate success. But it feels like blind luck when it works and I can\u2019t seem to nail down a pattern.", "created_utc": 1560427097, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c04wvl/on_playing_earnings_straddle_or_strangle_wide_or/", "is_self": true}
