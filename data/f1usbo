It derives 86+% revenue from e-commerce, which is basically one of the few industries that can massively benefit from a virus outbreak. Bitches who have bought puts point out that the coronavirus will impact the delivery and production of goods; however, government data has soon that deliveries have increased. And E-Commerce firms like JD have seen a sharp increase in orders: \n\n\"Previously, on a typical day, a courier for [JD.com](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=JD) in Beijing would deliver about 140 to 150 packages per apartment complex, said Lansong Sun, head of the company\u2019s delivery station in Yizhuang, on the outskirts of Beijing.\n\nNow, that\u2019s climbed to more than 200 orders a day\".\n\n Since Alibaba is an even larger player than JD, this must mean that Alibaba's e-commerce revenue will increase during virus times instead of decreasing. \n\nVery few people on the sub actually know what e-commerce means for Alibaba. Unlike Amazon, Alibaba actually acts mostly as a middleman in transactions, meaning it makes money off of vendors digitally. Whether or not the coronavirus spreads has very little to do with digital business activity. \n\nI believe that currently, Baba stock is down because of the market perceives Alibaba similar to Amazon, a logistics heavy eCommerce company. However, once BABA releases an earnings beat and healthy guidance, there will be a swift rise in BABA's stock price and the stock will no longer be a steal. Other catalysts for Alibaba stocks include their rapidly expanding cloud computing division and trade war progress. \n\nBTW I have a 9k position in Alibaba calls strike 220 expiring March 20th", "created_utc": 1581360472, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f1usbo/alibaba_calls_before_earnings_are_basically_free/", "is_self": true}
