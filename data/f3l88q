But actually, you\u2019re wrong because this next sentence is: I want RH to make a credit card where the points AUTO ACCRUE in your available cash section of your app. Then every month you pay the bill on time, RH also offers you margin at a lower interest rate. This is fool proof for us because it skips the step where you have to dump money into your account and it\u2019s fool proof for RH (with their risk management team at least) because they can rope in newbies to spend every dime they have on gambling options. \n\nThoughts? Should RH hire me?", "created_utc": 1581646630, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3l88q/new_robinhood_idea/", "is_self": true}
