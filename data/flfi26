Not so weird after you realize\u2026\n\nOn April 20th, approximately $146,000,000 of ITM put options will be expiring. In order for those options to rend a profit, there are only two options:\n\n(1) The put contracts are sold as a whole, generating a profit delta.\n\n(2) The put contracts are executed, the broker puts in a buy order for you, then subsequently triggers the actual execution by then selling those shares to whoever sold you the contract.\n\nNormally (1) is how most of us get our tendies. However, since the option is expiring, the large increase in put contracts being sold will create a drop in premium. Also, not everyone will/knows to do this, and further consider that many of these contracts have likely been purchased as a hedge (not meant to execute most likely) so that leaves us with option (2).\n\nThe issue is that unless you have secured Uber shares at a certain price point, your broker will likely be purchasing the shares at market, then selling them at your put strike price to finish the contract. \n\nWhat does this mean? Well it means that throughout the day, and close to expiration, you will likely see a movement analogous to a \u201cshort squeeze\u201d, but for your put options. \n\nAs $140 million dollars worth of contracts are executed, we are talking about 24, 242,900 shares of UBER, which at the current price point is $499,403,740 dollars worth of UBER. So approximately half a billion dollars in shares\u2026\n\nA half a billion dollars worth of shares to be purchased in one day\u2026 that might cause a bit (or a large) bump in the share price. This is also just talking about puts, and yes, not all contracts will be executed, but even half of that number will be an absolutely massive amount of pressure on the price, with a high risk of triggering a large increase in price.\n\nAfter all, isn\u2019t making $12 million dollars (by purchasing shares that have gone up significantly for the day), better than making $0?\n\nIf you read this far, you\u2019re probably thinking\u2026 WTF do I do then? Stop talking, I\u2019m getting angry!!! Well, if I\u2019m right, it\u2019s simple. Buy an UBER call, expiring March 27th. After all, we\u2019ll know after tomorrow if I\u2019m on target or not. Look at the price today, what changed? Put \u201cshort squeeze\u201d.\n\nTLDR, POSITIONS:\n\nUBER Mar 27 $25 C\n\nUBER Mar 27 $30 C", "created_utc": 1584644264.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flfi26/all_in_uber_calls_buying_today_and_tomorrow/", "is_self": true}
