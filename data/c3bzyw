We already know Papa Elon frequents this sub, so read up so we can load up on tendies.\n\nWe know the fuzz is self driving cars. After BYND and TLRY partner up for those THC patties... how are we going to cook or heat up our meatless tendies/patties while we bet our life savings on the road?\n\nEnter TSLA and WHR. Possible partnership could create appliances for TSLA. If TSLA smart, they would use this genius idea for their initial marketing for the pickup truck as their battery would power these special microwaves and air fryers.
