{"id": "femv9x", "title": "DD: Theme park wait times and closures", "selftext": "I live in LA but I spent the last 10 years living in Orlando and visited the theme parks probably one day a week on average; mostly WDW, but also Universal, and SeaWorld. I know that sounds like a lot, but they offer FL resident discounts on annual passes, and when you live there, you end up with a lot of friends in that sphere.\n\nFirst off: They don\u2019t reveal daily park attendance numbers, but you CAN download apps for any of these parks and see live wait times. The Disneyland (CA) app is different from the Disney World app (FL). In the SeaWorld app you can view all 3 locations (FL, TX, CA) in the same app. And finally, Universal Orlando and Hollywood are also separate apps.\n\nWait times are generally pretty consistent which makes them a good indicator of park populations. Newer rides are generally higher (Hagrid\u2019s Motorbike ride is newer and ~100 minutes today), and weekends are busier. But if you see the big IP attractions like Avatar / Star Wars get down below 30 mins on a weekend, that should be a red flag. I was looking at SeaWorld and it looked pretty slow, but it\u2019s also a Friday, so I\u2019m checking tomorrow and Sunday.\n\nSecond: WDW rarely closes. Since 1971 they\u2019ve closed less than 10 days or so, mostly due to hurricanes. If they take the same measures as the Disney parks in Asia and close for weeks, hopefully you\u2019ve already bought puts.", "created_utc": 1583539712.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/femv9x/dd_theme_park_wait_times_and_closures/", "is_self": true}
