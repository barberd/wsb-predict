{"id": "d6u9qu", "title": "Recession Imminent? - Reeeeeepo-colopyse", "selftext": "It's the end of September 2019 and you're the typical U.S. consumer. You're feeling confident, raw water in one hand and a greasy I-phone touch in the other. You've just left your job as a part-time yoga instructor to become an \"entrepreneur\". That's right, you've signed a 1 week lease for a corner office at the local WeWork. Sure, you might not be making money now, but you're confident in you'll be able to pay off your six figure student loans and retire early as soon as a Democrat's in office. Fortunately, there's a \"venture capitalist\" sitting in the cubical next to you the first day you arrive. You hit it off right away and both share a mutual interest in the MeToo and HandsUp movements. Feeling comfortable, the VC let's you know that actually, he likes your we-desk better than his own. You've got a standard issue we-succulent and some picture frames he'd like to use. But you're no fool, \"show me the money\" you say as he signs over funding to tune of $1Billion for your new venture, \"DeskSwap\". \n\n**You're the latest tech unicorn. You've made it.**\n\nYou decide to celebrate by doing CBD body shots off of the \"community-event-coordinator\" during your lunch-break at the WeWork wet bar, when you have a moment of sudden realization. You're a complete moron and the world is coming to an end.\n\n---\n\nThis realization is a sure indicator of peak market conditions. As the marginal consumer of Vanguard mutual funds, marijuanna stocks, and tech IPOS, the American economy, and thus the global economy, runs on the ignorance of millions of millennials.  Unfortunately for them, it's the geriatrics of the world who hold the real dough, and you can bet your fidget spinner that Grandpa isn't the idiot buying the BYND meat IPO. He cucked you a long time ago with social security and he has one more trick up his sleeve, that's right, 10yr treasury loans. \n\nWith yields going to as high as -2%, the octogenarians of America recognize that paying the government to hold their money is a better investment of their hard-earned dollars than investing in your future. Your grandparents saw you grow up and they know how little you're capable of. \n\n---\n\n*TL;DR* - **The recent debacle in the repo market is a sign that the Fed has gone full-retard. Banks and large corporations, run by senior-citizens, are trying to pull another heist on the \"entitled\" generation. Much like the housing bubble, the media continues to deny the potential implications of this yuge instability. We have reached peak autism, and with consumer confidence at all time highs, keep an eye out for recession.**", "created_utc": 1568982927, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d6u9qu/recession_imminent_reeeeeepocolopyse/", "is_self": true}
