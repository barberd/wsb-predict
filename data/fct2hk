I know that many boomers will see this as a signal to buy in and we may see a big increase in airline stocks over the next few days.\n\nMy puts expire on March 20. I know a lot of people also are holding airline puts DAL, AAL, UAL for the 20th. Should we hold our puts for the 20th, or would it be safer to sell off now (even at a loss) and buy longer term puts for airlines? Pre-market DAL is up 5%... I think it's a good idea to sell out now, wait for the market to go up, and buy puts during this faux rally.", "created_utc": 1583233928, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fct2hk/thoughts_on_airline_puts_for_this_week/", "is_self": true}
