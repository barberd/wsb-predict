{"id": "fi0jel", "title": "Question about crash", "selftext": "Considering how many companies are trading at 20x their PE or higher, how can they crash 30% from this? If (and i know this isnt how it works) they were to pay dividends of all their earnings to share holders it would take 20 years to match the stock price. So even if they have no earnings for 6 months, it would take 20 years + 6 months to do the same thing? If your buying stocks because of their current and future potentials, a 6 month set back doesn't seem like its 30% of a companies value.", "created_utc": 1584109969.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fi0jel/question_about_crash/", "is_self": true}
