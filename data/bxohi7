Completely did not expect this. The fresh platform and restaurant growth is literally jaw dropping. This is the fastest growing company I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. The only thing that concerns me is the Operating Margin being so negative. This will of course improve over time but it is still eye opening nonetheless. Not too worried about expenses such as SG&amp;A and R&amp;D because 1) revenue growth is far outpacing expense growth and 2) it makes sense that expenses will continue to grow for the next few quarters as BYND is investing in ways to grow their business. Their primary growth source has been new customers so far and expanding into more locations. Solid growth plan, for now. If they don\u2019t change their growth plan, I\u2019m worried their growth may come to a halt prematurely.
