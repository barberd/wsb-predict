I had 7k USD and thought I would short oil, because it had to drop, right? And drop it did. I used x10-16 in leverage.  7k USD became 16k USD quickly.\n\n I continued shorting, but price went up and I went down to 5k USD. I shorted a few times again and went up to 18k USD. I continued shorting but price went up again and now I am down to 3k USD. I never stopped believing in shorting. \n\n3k USD then became 27,5k USD when price collapsed royally when the WTI May contract expired. For some stupid reason I thought that oil at the price of 10,45 USD would crash. I bet all 27,5k USD and price went up hard and I lost it all. I could have pulled out of my position a couple of times and saved at least 50% but my greed said \"it will reverse\". My greedy fuck self should have invested a small portion of the 27,5k USD instead of going all in. \n\nDon't. Be. A. Greedy. Fuck. Like. Me. \n\nI hate my myself. I can't believe what I have done.", "created_utc": 1589483727.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gjsxir/dont_be_a_greedy_fuck_like_me/", "is_self": true}
