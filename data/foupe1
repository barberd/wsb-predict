Non essential business have to close and everyone must be six feet apart. Strict quarantine for people flying in and out and penalties for non essential travel . \n\nPrevious to this , they were on second highest alert and the virus seemed under control , but with double digit growth. They had some spikes recently . \n\nThey have big brother style contact tracing and publish all travel logs of patients . Singaporeans are law abiding and self lockdown well. Health care is universal and far better than USA . Test results in a few hours and they just invented a new test to get results in 5 minutes . Still couldn\u2019t get the virus to go the fuck away. \n\nTLDR: any hope this virus goes away in summer weather is gone . Anything less than draconian quarantine won\u2019t work . Puts for May and out . Spy 206p .", "created_utc": 1585158594.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/foupe1/dd_singapore_still_doesnt_have_beer_flu_under/", "is_self": true}
