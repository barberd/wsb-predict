{"id": "b68igc", "title": "So IG Group Opens Retail Forex in 'Murica - For people like me This is How You Can Pass the Approval Process", "selftext": "I have been trying to get an IG account opened but the last two attempts I have made were denied. I have never been denied the approval process for any of my FX accounts \u2013 but the fact that IG has about 30% lower spreads than the other FX brokers prevented me from giving up.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t know IG Group, they are a London Stock Exchange based company for the past 44 years with their really cheesy/corny \u201cchampioning the client\u201d slogan.\n\nI called up their customer support in Chicago and asked what the deal was. My license was okay, my documentation was fine, but I learned that currently, IG is only accepting clients that put on their resume they either have at least $50k in their savings OR make at least $100k a year but they are not being open about it.\n\nMost people here can agree; I don\u2019t like to report to companies online how much I have in my savings or make a year as it is not legally required by any federal body for an approval of account. It\u2019s not like they verify or check up on it. I was putting the lowest tier of income and savings thinking that was okay \u2013 but obviously it wasn\u2019t.\n\nSo on my third attempt, I filled out the application and put that I make over $100k a year and just like that \u2013 I now finally fucking have an IG forex account!\n\nI\u2019m not trying to shill IG or anything, but those who have been in the trading game the last 15-20 years probably feel that sensational prestige being able to have an IG account.", "created_utc": 1553714739, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b68igc/so_ig_group_opens_retail_forex_in_murica_for/", "is_self": true}
