Now remind yourself a bunch of those people work for big hedge funds and big banks because of daddy's connections and the truly worthless go raise funds for charities or something. A guy I know works for JPMorgan and he could be mostly aptly described as a rock eater (well take any anecdotal evidence with a grain of salt but I'm sure I'm not the only one to know a glue sniffer who works on Wall St.)\n\nSome single individuals like Michael Burry (who's now bathing in his pre pump WYNN/LVS/FL calls) are able to beat the market consistently but those people are so fucking rare they generally can't overcome the mass of retards that usually compose the rest of their funds or bank (even then they can be wrong, hello GME). These people represent 0.00001% of institutional investors and most of the time the money they move is not enough to get things going\n\nAnd that truth is reflected when it's put under the microscope:\n\n'' From January 1994 to October 2018\u00a0\u2013 through both bull and bear markets\u00a0\u2013 the passive [S&P 500 Index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp500.asp) outperformed every major hedge fund strategy by about 2.25\u00a0percent\u00a0in annualized return ''\n\nSo stop worrying about ''the rug getting pulled'' in these times because they can't pull the rug on their own. We gotta pull it with them too. We saw that when even big Daddy Buff got out earned by mental retards for 2 months straight. He sure as fuck didn't want to tank that 20% loss on purpose. So stop worrying so much about how ''big money'' is gonna fuck us and enjoy the ride of the most roller-coaster market of our lifetimes.  \n\n\nEdit: Don't wanna get banned so positions here, mostly cash cuz switching brokers but\n\nHTZ 7/17 2$ and 3$ Ps\n\nMGM 6/26 21$ C\n\nRDSa 7/17 35$ C\n\nPFE 7/17 35$ C", "created_utc": 1592081385.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h8fjcj/stop_pretending_hedge_funds_and_big_banks_arent/", "is_self": true}
