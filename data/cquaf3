{"id": "cquaf3", "title": "I've got a 15,000 Schwabb account for investing from a scholarship, I need advice.", "selftext": "So I have a scholarship that teaches us about investing and gives us each $15,000 to invest into three different companies and after we graduate we keep the profit over the original 15,000. We have a lot of rules to this investing but I'm trying to keep this post simple. So basically we can invest in 3 companies at a time and we have to hold onto the stocks for a year before we can sell (the scholarship foundation wants us to learn long-term investing). Last year I bought LUV, SNA, and PFG. I got fucked with those and lost money. Now we have to sell one of our old ones and buy a new one. The rich guy who funds this scholarship has a hand picked list of 76 companies that we choose from. From this lost i'm strongly considering buying Nucor. Idfk tho so any help is appreciated. If this breaks the subreddits rules I'm sorry I've got a deadline to submit this buy/sell request", "created_utc": 1565895619, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cquaf3/ive_got_a_15000_schwabb_account_for_investing/", "is_self": true}
