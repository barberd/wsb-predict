Their over-reliance on small medium businesses will be their downfall since mom and pops shops are  cutting their advertising budget to cut costs. Also with mandatory lockdowns being rolled out in more and more places the situation will only get worse and worse.**\n\nYelp primarily generates revenue from from sale of advertising on their site and app from local businesses and to a lesser extent, fees on transactions completed on their platform and subscription fees on their non-advertising products. \n\nDirect quote from Yelp\u2019s 10-K: **\u201dSMB have also historically experience high failure rate and we must continually add new advertisers to replace those who do not renew their advertising due to factors outside of our control such as the cleaning advertising budgets closures or bankruptcies. As a result SMBs may be the disproportionately affected by negative fluctuations in the business cycle and the worsening economic outlook would likely cause business is to decrease investments in advertising with with adversely affect our revenue\u201d.**\n\n\u201cWe generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. If we fail to maintain and expand our base of advertisers, our revenue and our business will be harmed.\u201d\n\n**Their customers aren\u2019t locked in. They can cancel at any time. I suspect they have lost a shit ton already and will continue to bleed.**\n\nRisk to Business listed in 10k:\n\n\u201dOur advertisers typically do not have long-term obligations to purchase our products. A substantial and increasing portion also have the ability to cancel their ad campaigns at any time. Their decisions to renew depends on the degree of satisfaction with the products as well as a number of factors that are outside of our control including their ability to continue their operations and spending levels.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s going to get ugly fast. I think this will trade in the single digits in a month.", "created_utc": 1584576612.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fl07g5/yelp_puts_13_821/", "is_self": true}
