{"id": "g5smyo", "title": "Weird Stuff Going on With USO", "selftext": "On this week's special edition of DDDD (Data-Driven DD), we'll be going over some funky shit that's going on in the USO ETF, and what may be the biggest arbitrage opportunity in the history of the stock market, driven by dumb retail investors pouring money into ETFs that they don't understand.\n\n*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so; look at what happened to all the SPY 220p 4/17 bag holders. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*\n\n**Brief Background**\n\nIn case you\u2019ve been in a coma for the past few days, you\u2019ve probably already probably know about the crash in oil prices and what $USO is. It\u2019s an extremely popular Oil ETF and used as a mechanism for retail investors to speculate on the price of oil without actually needing to deal with futures, and potential complications that come with them like negative prices and being forced to accept delivery - something a lot of people probably found out about yesterday. This Oil ETF has grown to be massively popular in the past few days. Here\u2019s some of their stats as of April 21 2020 closing from their website.\n\n[USO 4\\/21 Stats](https://preview.redd.it/kb79o4jzz9u41.png?width=554&format=png&auto=webp&s=eee37a1d967c134a83367ba3cc987d4703482f0d)\n\n**Buying The Dip**\n\nThey\u2019ve got almost $3 Trillion in Net Assets, most of which came in the past few weeks as a massive flood of retail investors came in to \u201cbuy the dip\u201d. They went from 156 million shares outstanding at Feb 29 to 1.1 billion shares on April 20th. We\u2019ll go back to how that works and why that matters later. They\u2019ve also become extremely popular on Robinhood, with it being the top bought stock recently, which I (subjectively) take it as a red flag.\n\n[Robinhood users holding USO](https://preview.redd.it/3r2jmum30au41.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=116a24ea155ac86ed266f9fe77db6ae7fc03bded)\n\nThis spike in demand has been causing this ETF to have several problems recently. A few days ago, it became so big that it held 25% of all front-month oil futures outstanding, forcing it to restructure what assets it held because of regulations. There's also theories out there that the fact that USO holds so many contracts was one of the causes of the May contract crashing so dramatically yesterday. Today, demand for their shares increased to the point where they were temporarily no longer able to issue more shares until the SEC approved the registration of new shares they filed yesterday. The caused USO to no longer reflect anywhere close to what the true price of the underlying assets.\n\n**How USO Works**\n\nUSO, currently as structured, ~~holds 80% of their value in front month futures and 20% in second month futures~~ (won't be true in a few days, see edit below). In theory, the ETF price should equal the value of the shares of the underlying assets, right? Well, that\u2019s not what happened today.\n\nLook at the \u201cPremium Discount\u201d number. This is the percentage the ETF\u2019s market value is over or under the actual underlying asset. It\u2019s supposed to be extremely small, at least when markets make sense. But the amount of \u201cbuy the dip\u201d bulls irrationally bought USO shares, causing the price dislocation we see today, where USO is worth 36% more than the underlying asset.\n\n[Q4 USO Premium \\/ Discount Day Count](https://preview.redd.it/5hy319k80au41.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1aca9b8dd1f7ec7683b318a64f11d3226280c4fa)\n\nIn normal markets, seeing a premium or discount of more than 1% for USO is pretty rare, and the ETF price usually reflects the actual oil futures. Usually, when there is a premium between the ETF price and Net Asset Value, USO\u2019s Authorized Purchasers would purchase more of the underlying assets and issue additional shares until the ETF market price is the same as the asset\u2019s price, giving them a nice arbitrage opportunity to make easy money. The problem is that the sudden spike in bulls trying to bet on oil made it so that this mechanism cannot be used until the SEC approves the registration of the new shares they need to do this.\n\nSo, what happens when USO's share registration does get approved? USO's Authorized Purchasers will start printing new shares like they\u2019re JPowell trying to cure COVID-19 with his money printer until USO drops enough (i.e. to $2.06, or whatever the NAV is) to reflect the actual prices of the futures they hold. This seems to be the rare instance of arbitrage in the stock market, and I\u2019m kind of shocked some hedge fund hasn\u2019t taken advantage of this by shorting USO.\n\n**Why hasn't anyone taken advantage of this yet?**\n\nOkay, so there's a clear arbitrage opportunity here, why hasn't some MM or hedge fund taken opportunity of this? I was wondering this too, and jumped on a call with a friend who works in the ETF space, so here's my best understanding of what he explained to me. Say you're managing billions of dollars and you see this, knowing that the SEC will be approving the share registration in a few days. Seeing the oil prices the past few days you don't want any oil exposure, so you don't want to take the risk of short oil and thus can't short USO outright. If you want to take advantage of this, while remaining neutral on oil, you would short USO while buying the underlying futures to hedge against changes in the oil prices. The problem with this is now you're holding oil futures for June, which you found out yesterday can in fact go negative and you might have difficulty unwinding your trade, which itself is too much risk for you to take, so you stay out of it.\n\nLinks to sources in comments because automod blocks this post if I add them here.\n\nTLDR; Dumb bulls are pumping USO to the point where its price no longer reflects actual oil prices because USO is waiting for SEC approval to correct it (which according to my ETF friend takes a day or two). USO 2.50p 4/24 and pray that oil futures don't go up more than 36% in the meanwhile.\n\nEDIT - Apparently, USO announced today that is now changing their holdings to be 40% June, 55% July, 5% August, although it doesn't look like they've started the process of rolling their futures yet, which might affect things, although the NAV should theoretically be the same", "created_utc": 1587521113.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5smyo/weird_stuff_going_on_with_uso/", "is_self": true}
