Literally no one pays any attention.  We may as well be Alaska. \n\nFor example, in 2018 Seattle was choked with wildfire smoke for almost two months.  \n\n* Each day, the sky had a strong haze or was just straight brown, and the sun looked a post-apocalypitic red.  \n* Air pollution was worse than China at it's worse; it wasn't quite as bad as those mountain towns but it was close.  \n* There was a run on hardware stores for N95 masks, most ran out. (Luckily I got one back then so I'm well prepared for our next phase of the apocalypse). \n\nNo one in America gave a shit, it didn't really make national news for more than a day or two, even though it literally lasted months.  Then a couple months later, San Francisco starts to get smoke from wild fires, and it's in the national media every single day for two weeks. \n\nThis time, Seattle gets hit hard by coronavirus, and I watched this again play out. \n\n* Community transmission confirmed in a teenager\n* 20 people dead in a week \n* Impossible for anyone to get tested without naming someone who tested positive already\n\nAgain no one gave a shit outside of Washington, not until NY and CA were also hella infected. Thankfully Seattle residents took it seriously and started socially distancing immediately.  My company told me to start working from home on March 3rd. \n\nFINALLY people woke up at the beginning of this week.  (FINALLY my puts are printing.)\n\nNow I'm watching everyone bitch about quarantine on their fifth day.  Haha fuck you it's day 16 for me asshole. Fuck this nation, I hope everyone's 401k burns like our forests.", "created_utc": 1584684845.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flq18q/people_care_so_little_about_seattle_living_here/", "is_self": true}
