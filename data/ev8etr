Alpha Pro Tech is a company setup to take advantage of this, hence the 100+% jump in the past week. Now the price is coming back down (-25% today) but IV is crazy. \n\nThe virus is confirmed in Europe and America, and is confirmed to be contagious in the pre-symptomatic incubational period. This is a very contagious virus, but not necessarily so lethal. Demand will outstrip supply for PPE in hospitals. \n\nWith this volatility and high potential for multibagging, it seemed like an interesting discussion to raise (didn\u2019t see a discussion in APT yet). \n\nI\u2019m going to try and let IV die down and jump in long.", "created_utc": 1580232168, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ev8etr/alpha_pro_tech_apt_carona_and_you/", "is_self": true}
