Although I have been very successful in the past predicting movements traders should always make an effort to adjust their positions based on changing political and media landscapes. This approach isn\u2019t meant to be any more accurate than a meteorologist predicting the weather. Take positions at your own risk and always do your own due diligence. I release these for thoughtful criticism from traders who use different approaches for analysis.\n\nTl;dr: Bullish in the short term but there is going to be a wall of resistance after 285. Sitting on call positions with a convex tail hedge and tightening my stops once the market price get above 285\n\nTicker: $SPY\n\nIntervals: 1W, 1D, 1H\n\nIndicators: MACD, KDJ, MA(200 & 50), ATR, NetVolume, VPVR\n\nSignals: \n\n1W: MACD Bearish Decreasing Divergence, Net Volume (730) Bullish, KDJ Oversold Converging Bullish  \n\n1D: MACD Bullish Divergent, Net Volume (190M) Bullish, KDJ Overbought Converging Upward\n\n1H: MACD Convergent Inconclusive, Net Volume (-21M) Slightly Bearish, KDJ Overbought Divergint Bearish\n\nKey Supports: \n\n257\n\n248\n\n243\n\nKey Resistances:\n\n273\n\n285\n\n297\n\nPosition: 280c 5/17 with convex tail hedge. \n\nTargets: Take profit at 283 or above. Looking for possible entries during a reversal at or below 257.\n\nNews: \\[\u201cOPEC and its oil producing allies on Sunday finalized a historic agreement to cut production by 9.7 million barrels per day, following multiple days of discussions and back-and-forth between the world\u2019s largest energy producers. The cut is the single largest output cut in history.\n\n\u201d\\] (https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/12/opec-and-allies-finalize-record-oil-production-cut-after-days-of-discussion.html)\n\nAnalysis: Bullish momentum seems to be building on longer intervals although history has shown that bear markets have the most significant rallies. Still expecting a continuation of bearish trends over the next few months but in the short-term bullish positions seem justified with potential entries presenting themselves early Monday. Take profit or tight trail stop target should be found at 283 or above.\n\nCharts: [https://imgur.com/a/HkK6hV0](https://imgur.com/a/HkK6hV0)\n\nOption Flow Data: https://imgur.com/gallery/FkIM1rL\n\nAlternative Plays: XOM, USO, MSFT\n\nYouTube Walkthrough on TA: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI0XgK-qdvc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI0XgK-qdvc)", "created_utc": 1586761220.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0dvcg/my_last_post_for_you_retards_spy_bullish_ta/", "is_self": true}
