I\u2019m reposting...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not autistic enough to trade options. My wife doesn't even have a boyfriend. In fact, I don't even have a wife. But I follow this subreddit just because it's hillarious. Looking for advice from professional autist. I know I don't belong posting here but respect that there are some smart people here.\n\nI thought I'd get smart and time the market with 20% of my portfolio this crash. My portfolio isn't much but it's important for my living expenses. Retired young due to medical issues. Was planning to buy back in when we bounced slightly off the bottom. If that failed was planing to buy back in where I sold out (only about 9% above current value). On Friday, I couldn't invest because of medical issues (not Beer Flu related and I'm no Boomer)\n\nSo I think Monday will open big GREEN. I'm not sure the best way to get back in. Should I:\n\n1.) Hold off because the market is sure to fall lower than Mondays open.\n\n2.) Play it safe and buy at open. No guaranty it will fall that far again.\n\n3.) Put part in Monday morning, And part in next week unless buying opportunity presents itself.\n\n4.) Other (open to suggestions)\n\nMissing out on Friday has got me scared about missing out. Which I think many others feel and why I think Monday will open higher. Why I'm seeking advice. I think COVID-19 fear is peak now and will gradually subside as we see it's less deadly than we now think. So I personally don't see it ever reaching Thursdays low. I'm not even sure if it will come back to Monday's opening which I predict to be very high. Basically I'm just scared which is a bad place to make decisions from. Also kicking myself for missing Thursday and Friday.
