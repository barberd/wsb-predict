{"id": "hc9a72", "title": "WSB is feeling like a certain sub that can't be named right before the crash", "selftext": "WSB has gotten really popular in the main stream, and its showing with it acting more and more like a sub that sounds like BC0IN at its height.\n\nDaily trade day threads have become less \"what stock looks to moon\" and become a stream of shady salesmen pushing pump and dumps of random no name companies, DDs turned to just straight up infomercials for a stock with ZERO volume and interest, and getting flooded with completely clueless traders who buy anything that looks like the next Nikola feeding it all.\n\nToday the discussion thread had to be modded because shady people were pushing penny stocks in chat.\n\nIf its not that, its racist and incel bullshit thats infected the sub because they have no where else to go and try to take over whatever sub they can.\n\nIt really feels like the time just before the coin (no automod here) crash when posters at a certain sub were asking \"how to buy the S&P 500 coin\" when the SPY crashed not realizing that it was part of the stock market and people were pushing completely fraudulent virtual bucks to people who didn't know better ending in a famous scam we all know about that popped the bubble and caused a certain coin to lose more than half of its value.\n\nAnyone else notice this? It gets really scary how many parallels WSB has to that sub I cant name without getting automodded and I cant feel but a SHARP crash is right around the corner with no warning or ability for the FED to even be able to stop it.\n\nIt has really reduced the helpfulness of the sub in general as shady people just show up in more and more numbers as time goes on drowning out the real autists.
