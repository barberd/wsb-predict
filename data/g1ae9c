There is only one measure that matters, how the flock feels. Right now the flock is composed of boomers aka stonks only go up, and first time autists aka my friends. I had a conversation with a PhD friend of mine recently... a fairly intelligent dick. He has 0 business experience or knowledge, yet he was trying to convince me $DAL was a value. I am like, retard all of the planes are parked. how are they gonna make money? He mad similar comments about other fucked industry\u2019s cruise lines etc... again I attempted to persuade him not to invest, explaining how fucktarded his logic was. Low and behold his portfolio is mooning and mine is fucked. Sooner or later the millennial\u2019s thinking they are gonna be Rockefeller and Buffet are going to run out of solvency. They will pull their 10$ trendies outta the market so fast even they Algos can\u2019t keep up. That\u2019s when the real recession will kick in.\n\nOr I am just fucktarded myself and am trying to rationalize missing the bottom\n\nIWM 110p 5/1\n\nRIP spy 220p I remember when you were up 2000% and I was taking your wife to dinner... diamond hands are for losers", "created_utc": 1586887074.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1ae9c/ta_is_bs_the_market_is_propped_up_by_millennials/", "is_self": true}
