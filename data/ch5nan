{"id": "ch5nan", "title": "YOLO the FED with Eurodollar Futures Options", "selftext": "Hi \n\nSo I\u2019m extremely new to trading options...but this subreddit is full of the type of autistic degenerates I wanna talk to. Below is a trade I\u2019m considering making. But like I said I have no idea what I am doing. But I heard from a famous investor that investing in things you don\u2019t understand is the best way to make tendies \ud83d\udcb5\ud83d\udcb5\ud83d\udcb5\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the FED have overtightened into a weakening economy and we are heading into a recession. Surely the only reaction function they have is to cut rates. When you look at the two previous cutting cycles the FED have had to cut rates lower than in the previous cycle.\n\nWhich means that the likelihood is that we are going to see rates pinned around 25 bps or even negative. \n\nEurodollar futures prices reflect market expectations for interest rates in the next three-months. So if you think that IRs will decrease then you want to go long Eurodollars futures.\n\nI don\u2019t have the capital nor the knowledge to trade futures...but as it\u2019s a highly liquid market there are options.\n\nI can buy Dec14\u201920 calls at 0.120 (contract size is 2500) which is $300. If IR do fall to 25 bps then these will increase $1575 (525%) return. If they go negative, it\u2019s Lambo time!!\n\n[charts](https://imgur.com/gallery/VcHJrHz)\n\nLink above has the charts and some of the details of the options and payoffs.\n\nWhat I\u2019d love to know is why this is a shit trade? In particular with regards to the Greeks. They are confusing as fuck\n\nThanks\nJB", "created_utc": 1563958334, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ch5nan/yolo_the_fed_with_eurodollar_futures_options/", "is_self": true}
