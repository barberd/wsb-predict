Especially as most travelers are old, they will be super careful of cruises.\n\nThey way Carnival botched the Diamond Princess does not help their image at all. The fear is often a lot worse than reality, and that's what will be on the minds of most cruise-goers during the upcoming summer season.\n\nOh yeah, and looking forward to cancellations, analyst downgrades, the bad earnings and outlook and a whole host of other problems. It's like when a cruise gets ecoli, there's a ton of news and backlash. Well this time, it's like the entire fleet had it.\n\nTLDR:  \n\n1. There will be shitty guidance (April earnings)\n2. Analyst downgrades will be incoming\n3. Way more sensitive than airlines who rely on business travelers\n4. CCL has almost no non-tourism land holdings\n5. Target market is old people, which are most at risk.\n6. (Even though they are not unionized) Worker refusal to work\n\nCCL P$30 March 20 or P$25 July\n\n\\----\n\nAlso, remember how we WEAPONIZED AUTISM'd MSFT, TSLA, SPCE up with cheap calls? The reverse works with puts too. Algos on the other side will need to delta hedge puts, do covered puts, or somehow attempt to borrow or sell the underlying.", "created_utc": 1582604392, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f94hy6/the_case_for_ccl_puts/", "is_self": true}
