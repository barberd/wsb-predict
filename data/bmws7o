{"id": "bmws7o", "title": "Thoughts on US - China talks", "selftext": "Serious talk bois, I wanna know what's the sentiment of the latest tariff talks in this degenerate sub here.\n\nPersonally, I got a few outcomes that will result from these talks:\n\n1. **China says \"\u4ed6\u5988\u7684\" and flips off the US, walks out of talks.** Trump uses it as justification to raise tariffs now and justify future tariffs in the future. China retaliates. We play the same game again in the next few months, except that its at 60% tariff levels. Maybe things will be different once China sends a warship into the market.\n2. **China attempts to delay talks.** Trump is furious and starts sending tweets to diss on China. China does not retaliate in hopes of 2020 US elections. If Tariff Man is re-elected again though, China is cucked big-time like some of our portfolios.\n3. **China gives in to some of US demands and appeases Trump.** Trump will probably tweet that he received a [\"big beautiful letter from Xi\"](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/928519663780208640?lang=en) like [good ol' pals](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/982954355509907457?lang=en) do. WW3 is averted and deadlines are extended once more for talks. Huge win for Trump, although not so much for China.\n4. **China literally becomes US' bitch.** China gives in to all of US demands, including greater access to Chinese markets and changing its economic laws and policies that favour the US more. &gt;!A possible merger between the US and China. Welcome to the American People's Republic.!&lt;\n\nThoughts?", "created_utc": 1557485364, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bmws7o/thoughts_on_us_china_talks/", "is_self": true}
