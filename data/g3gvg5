The sooner we open, the sooner everyone realizes the V-shaped recovery is a coronavirus-induced hallucination.  Nobody is going to want to go outside and spend money (do YOU want to go eat at Applebees and get infected by the high school dropout chef?)\n\nFrankly, I hope this house-of-cards market hits an ATH this week so I can double down.  You can't fix the economy until the health crisis is resolved, and the economic devastation will be most visible once we \"re-open\" (and eventually shut down again).
