Last thursday here i am, ready to place some OG bull bets to get that cheddar for friday opening bell. I have over 40 grand in options at the end of close on thursday. \n\n Friday morning started out like any other, woke up around 7.30, checked premarket and went and sat in the shower for the next 40 minutes and contemplated life while sticking one hand out the side of the tub and catching up on events as well as what you degenerates have been saying. Quickly i hop onto robinhood and see an \u201c ID required to trade\u201d notification, mind you i've been fucking trading on this account for over 3 months now and have never had an issue. I don't think to much of it and figure i can close my positions at the very least, which honestly was all that mattered for me on friday.\n\n  9.30 hits, shit goes all over, AMZN ofcourse fucks everyone because its a dickhead, and so in the first 5 minutes i go to sell it only to find out my account is fully fucking restricted and i cant buy or sell a damn thing. So here i am currently about negative one grand unable to do a fucking thing. Overdrive kicks in and i start getting my ID and bullshit sent to them. OF COURSE their upload notification fucks it up and fails to identify my ID and the account stays restricted. I proceed to send about 15 support tickets and even sit on hold for like 6 fucking hours with the customer support that i know doesn't actually exist and will never answer the phone. IM FUCKING LOOOOOOSING IT.\n\nAt the end of the day i was up 9 grand\u2026.\n\nSo yeah, i should have been fucking ecstatic but i was literally as emotionless as the night king before the attack. Just fuck this shit. I was fully aware i could wake up monday morning and it would all be gone and then some. \n\nWas up at 5 am today sending support tickets and calling phantom customer service. \n\nBy the end of today i had made another 5 and half grand, for a total sum of me not fucking doing a single thing the last two trading days of 15 grand. I have never been so stressed to make so much money in my life.\n\nFinally at fucking 3.30pm they get back to me and unlock my fucking shit. Took them 4 days. I have never fucking felt so much anxiety in 4 days, i almost fucking puked when i finally saw restrictions were lifted. I know a lot of you big boys and this wouldnt be shit for you, but man ive worked fucking hard for this cheese.\n\n I have closed all of those positions and will obviously be leaving these faggots while they eat ass and munch on \u201csnacks\u201d instead of focusing on their core issues. It was my fault for ever choosing them i know, but fuck free commissions sound good\n\nTLDR: Fucked with robin hood, got fucked by robinhood, still made money\n\nPS, also got myself banned at robinhood subreddit, fuck those pussies\n\nPPS, Just really want to get this out there to want you guys about them, these free commissions arent worth it, this wasn't the first or second time ive had issues with them either. They are a fantasy, a business model that has some much potential but they are to fucking stupid to properly utilize it", "created_utc": 1556569219, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/biu7q8/the_tale_of_the_double_edged_robinhood_ass_fucking/", "is_self": true}
