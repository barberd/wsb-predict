{"id": "gv0jbo", "title": "Market Timing Rant", "selftext": "One thing that\u2019s really annoying about this stuff is that we intuitively measure things from local bottoms to local tops, so we think, \u201cfuck, imagine if I\u2019d bought SHOP calls at $262 and sold at $844?\u201d Or \u201cimagine if I\u2019d bought PENN calls at $4 and sold at $39?\u201d\n\nBut the chance of an individual buying at the local low and selling at the local high, even within a week or month, is pretty much zero, let alone buying at the 52 week low and selling at the 52 week high.\n\nThinking about this right now because I get irrationally upset when I sell a contract and it goes up in value in the minutes, hours, or days after. The chance I was going to sell at the local top was low to begin with. Not sure if this is an argument to let winners ride longer or to lock in gains. Or maybe it\u2019s just an argument that you shouldn\u2019t be too hard on yourself when you sell too soon.", "created_utc": 1591072406.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gv0jbo/market_timing_rant/", "is_self": true}
