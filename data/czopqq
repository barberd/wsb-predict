I would like to know if you can donate me some links so I can study options trade.\n\nFor example, when I'm trying to learn something new I always like to do this question:\n\n\"If you could talk to your past self, what would you advise if you want to study what I am asking?\"\n\nThank you so much, sorry for bad english.\n\nPS: I'm trying to buy some US stocks (argentinian here, the economy went full hell), and I want something relatively stable. Someone told me to invest in utility stock, but, I don't know which ones are they.   \nI have a list of all the \"stocks\" that we can invest without having a US broker. Could you mind and check out which ones do you like? So i can investigate them later.\n\nI sincerely thank you in advance for the comments. Best regards, argentinian drowned. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Stocks ](https://i.redd.it/2fimrx0tdmk31.png)", "created_utc": 1567621483, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/czopqq/i_have_a_question/", "is_self": true}
