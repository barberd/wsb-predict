Welcome to the straddle.", "selftext": "Previous post: \n\n [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g53h2g/i\\_shook\\_the\\_crystal\\_ball\\_it\\_was\\_filled\\_with\\_tea/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g53h2g/i_shook_the_crystal_ball_it_was_filled_with_tea/) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nToday in the general \"how autistic can you be\" thread, I was asked a great question, courtesy of /u/[RB\\_GScott](https://www.reddit.com/user/RB_GScott/): \n\n\"Friday's SPY volume matched the volume on 2/21 right before the fall. What sort of volume levels are you looking for before it feels real?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo one can ever really predict if a stock will move up or down. Its just a matter of weighing your capital vs your risk, and quantifying your personal indicators. Here are mine: \n\n1. Our bounce seems to have stalled out according to the daily chart. We know that we need to begin looking for signs of reversal, while also being cautious that we know we're actively biasing ourselves to see something. There are 14 ways to read palms or tea leaves that say we're getting ready for the big down, but something to remember, THERE IS NO DELIBERATE FORCE APPLIED TO BRING US DOWN. Why is that capitalized like a retard wrote it? (well, one did) Because the same is NOT true in reverse, people are actively sabotaging the decline. Anyone that tells you that the stock market is zero sum is short sighted. We have a vested interest in making it go up. We have never crashed back to zero. We have regressed 5, 10, 20 years, but never all of the years. Its a bias we have to respect. \n2. We're looking for fundamentals to start failing. Fuck your cars, macd crossover, your amazon, your 3 bar play, your tesla, hammer doji bar, your facebook, all garbage. How about food, shelter, and industry. Industry, by the way, \\*IS\\* oil. Ok, so oil just shit its pants. Farming has started to stall out, farmers are once again considering dumping product or destroying product (this is actual grapes of wrath, by the way, for those of you who didn't read your books cuz you were too cool). Shelter, that bitch, shelter got the 3 month Trump dick delay. Its a real hindrance to our last big indicator. Will it hold strong? 700 billion in 7 days. Trump daddy promised to support oil no matter what, JPow said he'd never stop printing (and then he cut printing in half). We're in wild times. \n3. Re-opening failure. Up until people start getting sick, this will make the market go up or stall, realize this and stop bitching. \\*IF\\* people start getting sick fast enough, panic sets in, and you're all rich. If it doesn't, at least you're not poor. Why do I count on panic? I'm about to offend someone here, but oh well. Anyone 50 or under here has never really had to suffer a great epidemic or depression. We aren't fundamentally equipped mentally to understand why a war in Afghanistan should dare interrupt our evening Kardashian shows. If this goes tits up, people have to re-discover how to save plastic bags because they're too damn poor. It would be nice to think \"people change\", but how many times did your shitty ex girlfriend/boyfriend prove that to be false. \n4. Volume. So today was interesting. We had nearly identical volume up until the last hour today. We put on like 25-30m volume at the end of the day, and saw volume increase 80% from the previous day after that end of day boost, even though the end actually petered out to be unimpressive (no real sell off / buy in at EOD). The end of day gigantic volume increase is a great sign that something is coming.  \n5. Fundamentally, when buying a downturn, you have to check your work 3x to if you're buying a climb. The market really does go up more, and overall you're buying counter-trend. When buying counter-trend, the goal is to find out why you SHOULDN'T buy, not why you should. Money left on the table is better than money taken off. You can always find a new entrance, and honestly, if the fall starts, you can just skip the entrance and buy in the middle of a long decline bar, there will be plenty if we're right. \n\nMoving forward. The straddle. A straddle is a simple concept, you buy two identically opposed assets, in our case options, at the same time. Same strike, same expiration, and as close to same buying time as possible. \n\nWhat is a straddle fundamentally, and why is it good? \n\nA straddle is an option that is 2x as expensive (roughly) as a regular option. Both have limitless profit, and both hate it when you sit still. The big difference in a straddle is that you can make money going up or down, all you care is that it goes. \n\nHow is a straddle funded? \n\nStraddles suffer from 2x time decay, and 2x delta decay, because you have to buy 2 options to make it run. What does this mean? DON'T FUCKING SIT ON THEM. Seriously, if you need to think about whether you want to hang on to them, sell them while you think it over, you can always re-enter. Perfect straddle timelines: End of day to opening, Strong opening/closing movement, close immediately after. Advanced way to be a greedy shit on your options: When you think the leg you're on has finished moving up or down, sell the corresponding leg. If you're right, and you retrace, you'll make more money letting the other leg get some value back. IF IT STALLS DURING RE-TRACE, SELL YOU IDIOT, STOP RUINING THIS. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, \\*HOW\\* do options make you money? Options are fundamentally:\n\n (Underlying Value of Equity) x (Decaying Theta Multiplier) x (Delta \\[volatility\\] multiplier). \n\n\\*Note this is obviously simplified,  Hermione. Stop trying to teach Weasleys how to be Potters. \n\nYou also need to remember that delta WANTS to return to zero, so unless you buy in when Delta is already low, it is \\*also\\* generally a decaying multiplier. Because your value is based on multipliers, the option gets more value the farther away and more volatile it is. However, unlike oil, we know the lease amount an option can be worth: 0. So while an option might decay 50% to .50c, if the other side doubles to $2.00, you're .50c ahead. The only time this is really bad is when the option doesn't move in price, because the delta multiplier remains low and the theta multiplier continues to decay. This is why it is so much harder to get back to a previous value with options, because they are constantly suffering 2 forms of decay. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo if our straddles suffer 2x2 (4x)  decay, how do we profit from them? Define your timeline. DEFINITE YES I WILL GET OUT OF THIS AT THIS POINT IN TIME WHEN MY EXPERIMENT SUCCEEDS OR FAILS. \n\nStop telling me about your stupid ass diamond hands, we all know you can't afford diamonds after you blow your load being dumb. That shit is just cheap glass. You look like the trailer park bitch trying to look relevant after 40. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat are we saying when we straddle overnight? We're saying \" I want to participate in these mysterious gap up/downs, but we don't know feel we can accurately predict them, and I'm worried about missing the start of the plunge. If we're not mid plunge or rise on the OPENING BAR, then SELL. You can always re-enter bar two or 3 if you have a theory. \n\n\"Diicembr, I'm a moron and I didn't listen and didn't sell my straddle at the first peak like I promised I would, how do I fix this?\" \n\nIf its early in the day, there's a decent chance it will retest. When it does ,sell the profitable leg and let the loser retrace to previous mids. Of course, if you were paying attention, you'll also note you just payed for all that theta decay waiting. SELL YOUR SHIT AND JUST RE-ENTER THE 2nd RETEST. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nToday's post was angry because lots of people in the daily thread asking the same question: \n\n\"I don't know what to do, so strangers of the internet, please give me some worthless bias because I'm doubting my own\". \n\nDo nothing, this isn't your ride or die moment. If you completely miss out on the down, all the way to the bottom and you're just a ball of regret, buy Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple stocks, and go back to your life. In a year or 5, you'll have a lot of money and none of this stupid fomo stress. \n\nGood luck autists.
