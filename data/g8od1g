Wanna tell old Duncan what\u2019s bothering you? What\u2019s that, you YOLO\u2019d your mom\u2019s life savings on SPY puts? Now she has friends over every night, and they\u2019re saying bad words? Well champ, some mommys like being called those names. Maybe she cries in her room after they leave because she is still sad about Joe Exotic going to jail, I dunno. \n\n\nLets be honest champ, even if Robinhood did let you buy puts with good boy points, mommy has almost certainly margin called your GBP account too. Lets see if I can show you a little DD, that might make you some money, and maybe help you look at price targets in general a little smarter.\n\n\nSo, maybe you read an article that says the auto loan industry is about to go tits up. \u201cGreat\u201d, you say, \u201cI am going to short the nations\u2019 largest subprime auto loan company, Credit Acceptance Corporation ($CACC)\u201d. But mommy won't stop bringing home dates with that shallow thinking. \n\n\nNow the US auto loan industry divides its loans by FICO score. At the top are Super Prime, all the way down to Deep Subprime. Super Prime gets the best interest rates, and are the least profitable loans, and at the bottom are the Deep Subprime, borrowers with poor credit histories and therefore, extremely high APRs, usually between 15% and 19%. However, despite huge differences in the interest rates, almost all buyers end up with the same monthly payment:\n\n\n**Tier/FICO/Monthly Payment Average/ Share of Auto Loan Market**\n\nDeep Subprime/<500/ $490.50/3.9%\n\nSubprime/501-600/$493/15.95% \n\nNonprime/600-660/$486/18.36%\n\nPrime/661-780/$472/42.12%\n\nSuper Prime/781-850/$448/19.66%\n\nBut wait, each tier defaults at different rates! As of December, before the \u2018rona, default rates were already elevated\n\nDec 19 Delinquency Rates\n\n* Deep Subprime/Subprime--8.18%\n\n* Nonprime--2.89%\n\n* Prime--1.15%\n\n* Super Prime--0.25%\n\nNow, we can use the delinquency rate to offset the average monthly payment for each group, and then multiply it by its share of the market, like this:\n\n**Monthly Payment x share of balances x (1-delinquency rate) = (\u201cMonthly Payment Index\u201d)** \n\nThen just add each Loan Tier Indices up to get an estimated index score that represents monthly income in December of 2019 for a typical auto loan company. In this case it's 461\n\nNow, we need to know what is going to happen in a crisis. In 2010, at the bottom of the collapse of auto loan industry, we saw default rates increase 45%.\n\n\nDelinquency\n* Dec. 31, 2010 **5.27%**\n\n* Sept. 30, 2010-4.83%\n\n* June 30, 2010-4.84%\n\n* March 31, 2010--5.01%\n\n* Dec. 31, 2009--4.92%\n\n* Sept. 30, 2009--4.68%\n\n* June 30, 2009--4.47%\n\n* March 31, 2009--4.35%\n\n* Dec. 31, 2008--3.94%\n\n\n\nSo if we assume this crisis will also increase the already elevated default rates by 45%, then we can run our Loan Tier Index again and compare it to the original score. This will give us an estimate of the losses the auto industry can expect from this crisis. That new index score is 455\n\n\nSurprisingly, we find that because the industry has actually most of its loan balances with Prime and Super Prime buyers, that spike in auto loan defaults will change monthly revenues by just -1.28%\n\n\nBut, Duncan, what about CACC? Don\u2019t they focus on subprime buyers? Specifically with buyers with credit below 660? Yep, so lets run the same analysis, but for just for 660 and below credit scores. We find that their revenue hit will likely be -2.7%.\n\n\nThats...not too bad. \n\n\nSo now let's look at share price. Currently, CACC is trading at 270 with a P/E of around 7.8. However, TTM EPS in December 2019 was around 34.66. If we assume that EPS will take the same hit as revenue (-2.7%), we see that EPS drops to 33.7. If we assume the stock will return to the lower end of its historic P/E ratio of 10, that puts its target price at $336 per share, so at its current price of $271, it is actually worth **buying calls**.\n\n\nNow, I won\u2019t go into the balance sheet analysis, but CACC's debt levels are real low and their cash on hand will sustain them through a rough quarter or two. \n\n\nSo, lets think deeper than the algos. CACC specializes in subprime auto loans. No doubt, they will have an increase in defaults. But in the last crisis, their share price continued to rise. Why? Well, its because in an economic crisis, people who used to be prime auto loan customers, suddenly start to miss their mortgage, miss credit card payments, and generally tank their credit scores. Suddenly, their banks won\u2019t give them a loan, and CACC steps in. In a crisis, CACC is poised to make tendies as a lender of last resort to the droves of no-longer-prime buyers. \n\n\nSo there you have it little buddy. See, by taking your time, looking past the headlines, and running the numbers, your mom won\u2019t be the only person in the house making money by doing two D\u2019s at once. \n\n\nCACC 4/21 (or longer) 335c\n\n\n\n*I am not a financial advisor, this is just a an exercise, not financial advice. Also, the math involves a lot of rounding and assumptions to help us know if the current price is way off, or about right, don't confuse this for the work of a serious financial analyst.*", "created_utc": 1587941483.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g8od1g/cacc_subprime_autoloans_are_totally_gonna_go_tits/", "is_self": true}
