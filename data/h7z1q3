At least I get that sweet $1k instant transfer.\n\nTuesday, went bullish.  Did some dude's KR call play because of their earnings report Thursday.  Went well, bought KR $35c 6/19 at $0.80.  Stonks went up, got to $0.95.  Figured \"sweet, I'll lock in some of these gains.\"  Set up a Stop Limit order with the stop at $0.90, Limit at $1.00 thinking \"it'll sell if it goes below $0.90 or above $1.00.\"  Turns out, that's not how Stop Limit orders work.  Watched them tank all day Wednesday, bounced back to $0.85 Thursday morning so sold for a little bit of a gain.\n\nAlso bought DIS $130c 6/19 at $1.16.  Also tried to limit losses with a Stop Limit order at $1.00.  Also did not understand how a Stop Limit order works.  Sold it Thursday at $0.14.  Shoulda just held it to expiry.\n\nThursday morning, figure it's time to bear.  Buy my first put: SPY $296p 6/15 at $0.88 around 1 pm.  By 3:30, it's at $1.38.  Noice.  Screw around with a TQQQ call and UVXY put too, close both by EoD, didn't do much.\n\nFriday morning, I think \"another bear day, cool.\"  Put in a market order for SPY $301p 6/19.  Market price was $7.84.  Market opens, big green dildo.  Fuck.  Try to cancel, already fulfilled.  Got lucky, and it filled at $3.85 instead of $7.84.  Also bought TQQQ $71p 6/19 at $1.71.  I tried to sell the second dip of the day, would have made for a hell of a first week trading options, up over 100%.  That's when I learned what a PDT is.  Fuck.  At least RH stopped me before I actually got flagged.  Now, instead of up 80% on the day, I'm up 2% on the day, and holding SPY and TQQQ 6/19 puts through the weekend.\n\nBear monday?\n\nFuck it, I'll just drop $25k in there and PDT can eat a dick.", "created_utc": 1592016483.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h7z1q3/adventures_of_a_bicurious_bull/", "is_self": true}
