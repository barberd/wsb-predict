Obv high probability trades, with one bad one able to negate weeks worth of gains, yeah yeah, besides the point here. Anyways...\n\nI always knew option prices inflate prior to earnings due to IV, but seeing how drastic this gets sometimes because I\u2019ve been selling options is absolutely insane. \n\nFor example, I sold 215 LULU calls for $1 a piece the day of earnings expiring the next day. It was trading at $187 at the time. Had LULU not had earnings, those options would be worth a few cents. They were selling for a fucking dollar. LULU was also up 5% that day FYI \n\nI\u2019ve also noticed the IV increase has a strong directional bias... aka, even tho IV is rising, the wrong direction options don\u2019t benefit and lose value, while the right direction benefits BIGLY\n\nI noticed this on MDB and CRM. The day of earnings CRM had a few percentage points in gains that devastated the puts side but hugely inflated the calls side (granted puts were still relatively expensive but they lost a ton of value)\n\nSo I\u2019ve seen now that: \n\nIV increase prior to earnings causes dramatic increases in option prices of the right directional movement\n\nI don\u2019t know at which point in time prior to earnings IV begins to rise but it has an insane effect on the option prices of some stocks in the direction the stock begins to move prior to earnings \n\nSo the discussion topic: \n\nHas anyone tried an ATM straddles maybe 2 weeks out, on options expiring the week of earnings? \n\nYou need a minimum of +100% on the trade to be profitable, but...\n\nI \u201cFEEL\u201d like it\u2019s a can\u2019t go tits up play, where one side will definitely be boosted beyond 100% due to IV and directional movement \n\nAnd if there\u2019s no movement then the straddle shouldn\u2019t decay too much due to IV increase off setting theta on both sides of the stock doesn\u2019t move allowing you to exit with minimal loss \n\nHas anyone done this with success? \n\ninb4 this is a wendy\u2019s Sir\nInb4 \u201cyes\u201d", "created_utc": 1567908996, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d156ph/atm_straddles_a_couple_weeks_out_from_earnings/", "is_self": true}
