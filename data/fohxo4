Last week [Tinder downloads went up 13%](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3554771-tinder-sees-u-s-downloads-grow-in-past-week-report). That's right, some dating apps are up (a bit), some other apps not really, because during a Pandemic you can't really go out and meet up people. If you're smart you go on PornHub to get it over with and go back to making tendies. And if you waste space, you go online and send messages to randos that you can't conceivably meet up for at least a month or two, so that you can as well waste time together.\n\nWhat happens next? Well we're only at the beginning and haven't reached the peak yet which is expected in 1-2 weeks for NYC and probably 1-2 more week for other areas. We can't stay in lockdown for six months, but we can't either go back to work in two weeks like Trumpo saw us doing in his dream last night, because hospitals will be battlefields and if you have an accident on your way to getting the virus in the office, 911 will tow your car to clear the road and leave you on the sidewalk.\n\nIn reality what's gonna happen is that we'll stay home at least 2-6 more weeks, and when the beer virus growth is under control, businesses will gradually come back to life at a pace that allows dealing with new infections and regular care. This gradual re-opening will take another 3-6 months depending on therapy advances, better tracking etc. and bars and clubs will probably be amongst the last businesses allowed to re-open.\n\nWhat does it mean for MTCH? Put it simply, it's a watershed moment for online dating -- well, MTCH, since they own 80% of the market--, but the real growth isn't gonna be until Q2. Here is what's gonna happen:\n\nQ1:\n\n* people inevitably get horny in quarantine, after the [awkward roommate sex](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/imm/covid-sex-guidance.pdf) many people that never used online dating will install the app, set up their account and send bottles in the sea -- probably not pay for premium though, knowing that they won't go out on dates\n* as we've already heard here and other places, the quarantines will be a boon for divorce lawyers, each break up is two new users\n\nQ2:\n\nWhen people are gradually able to go out, they will need to unload their stress and celebrate by sleeping with strangers, and online dating is perfect because:\n\n1. bar & clubs will still be closed, and;\n2. you and your partner can exchange your covid status before you decide to meet up, hence avoiding getting the beer flu when you're only ready for herpes\n\nThis is such an obvious thing that I wouldn't even be surprised to see the gov supporting this usage in a few months to avoid super-spreader events in the upcoming waves.\n\nTiming: Match Group is expected to report their 2020 Q1 earning on or around 05/07, but are also obviously sharing numbers outside earning calls. I expect we will have a glimpse of Q2 usage by July.\n\nPrice: Match was already set to outperform this year, and lost -28.84% stock value in the past 3 months, while the S&P lost -24.70% over the same period. MTCH is the golden nugget while retards are still chasing quick returns on 1k+ P/E shops like ZM and TDOC.\n\nMTCH 7/17 95c", "created_utc": 1585101048.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fohxo4/mtch_717_90110c/", "is_self": true}
