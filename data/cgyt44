If there's an interest I can continue posting these.**\n\n \n\n**Today\u2019s Bullish Activity**\n\nSome notable upside earnings movers include:\n\n* **Coca-Cola Company (KO + $2.15 to $53.37):** The beverage company reported Q2 earnings of $0.63 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.02 beat) on revenue that rose 6.1% year-over-year to $10.00B (above the $9.86B expected) as organic revenue (non-GAAP) grew 6%. Comparable operating margin was 30.3% versus 30.6% in the prior year. The company reaffirmed full-year 2019 EPS growth of -1.0% to +1.0% while raising organic revenue growth to +5% from +4%. Shares of KO are trading at all-time highs this morning. Calls are outnumbering puts better than 4:1 with the August 16th 55.00 call topping the most actives list (volume is 1,058).\n* **Hasbro Inc. (HAS + $7.80 to $116.31):** The toy maker reported Q2 earnings of $0.78 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.28 beat) on revenue that increased 8.9% year-over-year to $984.54M (above the $958.91M expected). The company is attributing the robust results to strong demand for \u201cAvengers: Endgame\u201d toys. Shares of HAS notched a fresh all-time high of $119.72 earlier in the trading session. Puts are outnumbering calls roughly 5:4 but the August 2nd 114.00 call is the most actively traded contract (volume is 853).\n* **Polaris Industries Inc. (PII + $4.02 to $86.65):** The maker of power sports vehicles reported Q2 earnings of $1.73 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.08 beat) on revenue that rose 18.4% year-over-year to $1.78B (above the $1.77B expected). Gross profit margins on an adjusted basis declined 104 basis points year-over-year due to tariff costs and (lower gross profit margin) boats, partially offset by higher average selling prices. Looking ahead, the company said it expects full-year 2019 EPS to come in a range of $6.10-6.30 on revenue of \\~$6.81-6.87B versus the respective $6.06 and $6.78B consensus estimates. Puts are outnumbering calls nearly 2:1 with the August 16th 95.00 put garnering the most attention from traders (volume is 353).\n* **Stanley Black &amp; Decker Inc. (SWK + $9.51 to $151.01):** The home improvement tools maker reported Q2 earnings of $2.66 per share ($0.11 beat) on revenue that increased 3.2% year-over-year to $3.76B (below the $3.81B analysts had expected) as gross margins declined 80 basis points year-over-year to 34.8%. The company reaffirmed full-year 2019 EPS guidance of $8.50-8.70 (vs. the $8.63 consensus estimate) and said it expects free cash-flow conversion of approximately 85-90%. Calls are outnumbering puts roughly 3:1 with the August 16th 152.50 call being the most actively traded contract (volume is 112). \u00a0\n\nNew 52-week highs (77 new highs today): **Analog Devices Inc. (ADI + $1.63 to $119.34), Haemonetics Corp. (HAE + $0.37 to $122.80), KLA-Tencor Corp. (KLAC + $1.50 to $138.65), Kansas City Southern Inc. (KSU - $1.22 to $124.12)**\n\n**Notable Call Activity**\n\nOnline pet store **Chewy Inc. (CHWY - $0.51 to $29.70)**\u00a0is trading at a post-IPO low this morning but some unusual call activity is coming up on the radar. Calls are outpacing puts roughly 12:1 which is primarily being driven by two 8K blocks that simultaneously traded earlier this morning:\n\n* An 8K block was sold on the October 18th 30.00 call for $2.90 (open interest is 8,375)\n* An 8K block was bought on the October 18th 25.00 call at the ask price of $6.00 (open interest is 43)\n\nBased on the open interest figures it appears that a previously held long 8K call position was rolled down from the 30.00 to the 25.00 strike price, which suggests that the block trader is still bullish on this name but perhaps not *as* bullish as when the position was established. Chewy Inc. began trading as a public company on June 14th and the stock has traded in a range of $29.03-$41.34 since then.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL + $1.16 to $62.90):** Calls are outpacing puts better than 5:1 as the top eight most actively traded contracts are all calls. The most actively traded contract is the August 16th 62.50 call (volume is 6,275 vs. open interest of 2,133) which mostly consisted of a 4,936 block that was bought at the ask price of $0.90 (suggesting bullish intent).\n\n**Today\u2019s Bearish Activity**\u00a0\n\nMultiple stocks are moving lower this morning following quarterly results:\n\n* **Cadence Design Systems Inc. (CDNS - $1.22 to $71.44):** The chip-design software company reported Q2 earnings of $0.57 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.04 beat) on revenue that increased 12% year-over-year to $580.42M (slightly above the $579.41M expected). In terms of guidance, the company said that Q3 EPS is expected to be $0.50-0.52 on revenue of $570-580M (vs. the respective $0.50 and $576.12M consensus estimates) while full-year 2019 EPS is expected to come in a range of $2.11-2.17 on revenue of $2.315-2.335B (vs. the respective $2.09 and $2.32B consensus estimates). Calls are outnumbering puts nearly 2:1 with the August 16th 75.00 call topping the most actives list (volume is 511).\n* **Centene Corp. (CNC - $0.78 to $51.41):** The U.S. health insurer reported Q2 earnings of $1.34 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.10 beat) on revenue that increased 29.4% year-over-year to $18.36B (above the $18.02B analysts had expected) as managed care memberships increased 2.2M (or +17%) to 15.0M. The company raised guidance as full-year 2019 EPS is now expected to come in a range of $4.29-4.49 on revenue of $73.6-74.2B (from prior respective views of $4.24-4.44 and $72.8-73.6B). Calls are outnumbering puts 5:3 with the August 16th 52.50 call being the most actively traded contract (volume is 280).\n* **Whirlpool Corp. (WHR - $9.99 to $138.36):** The appliance maker reported Q2 earnings of $4.01 per share ($0.29 beat) on revenue that rose 1.2% year-over-year to $5.2B (above the $5.03B expected). Ongoing EBIT was $363M (or 7.0% of sales) vs. $343M (or 6.7% of sales) in the year-ago quarter. The company raised full-year 2019 EPS to a range of $14.75-15.50 (from a prior view of $14.05-15.05) and said that it expects to generate cash provided by operating activities of \\~$1.4B and free cash flow of \\~$800M. Puts are outnumbering calls roughly 5:4 but the August 2nd152.50 call is topping the most actives list (volume is 113).\n\nNew 52-week lows (147 new lows today): **Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY - $0.05 to $42.72), Intercept Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ICPT + $0.42 to $67.47), Kroger Company (KR + $0.09 to $20.95)**\n\n**Notable Put Activity**\n\nSome unusual put activity (\\~33:1 over calls) is being seen in **Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (ADM + $0.25 to $40.63)** which is mostly due to activity on the August 2nd40.00 put. Volume on this contract is 12,062 versus open interest of 66, so it\u2019s likely that this is all new positioning. The bulk of the transactions on this contract consisted of various sized blocks that were being bought for between $0.60 and $0.63 each, which suggests bearish intent. The positioning comes ahead of the company\u2019s Q2 earnings release which is scheduled to be released before the market open on August 1st.\n\nAlso seeing some heavy put activity (\\~4:1 over calls) is **Teva Pharmaceuticals Inc. (TEVA + $0.11 to $7.80)** which is primarily being driven by activity on the December 20th6.00 put. Volume on this contract is 42,761 versus open interest of 17,157, so we know that this volume primarily represents new positioning. The bulk of the volume consisted of various sized blocks that were being bought at various ask prices, including a 7,092 block that was bought for $0.52 when the bid/ask spread was $0.50 x $0.53 which suggests bearish intent.\n\n**Volume Signals** \n\n**Adient PLC (ADNT + $1.66 to $23.37):** Today\u2019s option volume on this car seat maker is 48,403 versus average full-day volume of only 189 contracts which is primarily being driven by three large blocks that simultaneously traded on the September 20th expiration earlier this morning:\n\n* 27.00 call: an 18K block traded for $0.76 when the bid/ask spread was $0.85 x $1.00 (open interest is 0)\n* 23.00 call: an 12K block traded for $2.35 when the bid/ask spread was $2.35 x $2.55 (open interest is 0)\n* 19.00 put: an 18K block traded for $0.85 when the bid/ask spread was $0.80 x $0.95 (open interest is 10)\n\nWe know these blocks are new positions based on the open interest figures but beyond that it\u2019s difficult, if not impossible, to determine what kind of three-legged combo position the block trader established here. ADNT is scheduled to report Q3 earnings before the market open on August 6th so this positioning captures the potential impact of that event.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**Omnicell Inc. (OMCL + $1.11 to $69.47):** Option volume is running at over 11x the daily average of 148 contracts which is primarily being driven by a couple of mid-sized blocks that simultaneously traded on the August 16th expiration:\n\n* A 750 block was bought on the 65.00 put for $2.20 (open interest is 48)\n* A 750 block was sold on the 60.00 put for $0.95 (open interest is 57)\n\nWe know these blocks are new positions and it appears that a $5.00-wide bear put spread was established for a net debit of $1.25 (x 750 contracts x 100 multiplier, excluding commissions) which suggests that the block trader believes that OMCL will close below the break-even price of $63.75 at expiration. The positioning comes ahead of the company\u2019s Q2 earnings report which is scheduled to be released after the market close on Thursday (July 25th).\n\n**Range Resources Corp. (RRC + $0.07 to $5.53):** A 8,650 block was bought on the January 2020 6.00 call at the ask price of $0.80 (open interest is 14,346). It\u2019s likely that this block is a new position given the expiration date but we can\u2019t be sure given the open interest figure.", "created_utc": 1563917459, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cgyt44/todays_options_market_72319/", "is_self": true}
