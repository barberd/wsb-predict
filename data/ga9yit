P/L on the screenshot doesn\u2019t include yesterday\u2019s gains. This is in my roth so no taxes.\n\nI said if SPY opened above 291 today I\u2019d send some WSBers money so I\u2019ll be doing that shortly. \n\nI\u2019ll probably be pissed in a couple hours for selling too early but it is what it is.\n\nAnother thing: not sure if anyone has had this happen but I had a big futures position that I opened at close. It was /ES 2890c x20 that I bought for 5.60. I normally open positions like this and sell futures contracts against them so I can get more leverage (try this out if you haven\u2019t, lots of money to be made). Anyways, out of nowhere TD messaged me and said I didn\u2019t meet Martin requirements (there\u2019s 50k in that account?) and they sold my position. Those contracts are now going for 30 a piece.\n\nHas anyone had this happen? Can I call and get money back?\n\nEdit: Sending money to people from my post last night.
