{"id": "f6mq5x", "title": "You like options? Here's some that might give some tendies: VSLR, CARG, ACM, LB (plus full info)", "selftext": "What's up fellow tendie-chasing autists!\n  \nI wanted to point out some option plays that are prime for a run over the next several weeks.  I entered these positions today.\n\nDisclaimer:  Again.  I entered these positions today.  This means I am holding this position.  This is a meme post, not financial advise.\n  \nRight.  Anyway.\n  \nVSLR.  It's a sympathy play to ENPH.  All of those who are butt hurt about missing a 40%+ run in ENPH should look at this one.  It has earnings coming up in March.  And there was a 3K contract sweep in the March 15 strike calls.  Why?  Because it's going to follow suit.  And you have a freaking MONTH.\n  \nNext up on the list is ACM.  Consistently hit my significant volume scanner and the MM's kept knocking it back down each and every time.  Huge volume spikes to $51 then they'd kick it back down to the median $50.  Then a huge volume spike to $52 and then they'd kick it back down to $50.50.  Almost to get people not to notice?  But hey scanners notice.\n  \nSo what's cool about this one.  There's 13K contracts swept in the March 50 strike calls.  And another 13K contracts swept in the March 55 strike calls.  There's chatter that they're going to be sold.  For what price?  Your guess is as good as mine.  There were articles circulating back in January that they were reaching an agreement.  So, with this many contracts purchased, it seems like somebody knows something.  So I followed it.  Oh - and it reminds me of the same exact thing that happened with TCO (taubman mall or whatever the hell it's called).  I noticed significant volume and it kept going right back to the median price.  Over and over.  And tons of call sweeps.  I bought calls for months out, and then I sold them a few days later for a few thousand buckaroonies.  Low and behold, I woke up a week ago to find that the company was bought for $50-something-retarded dollars per share.  Which would have netted me a cool $100K but I panzied and sold for just a few hundred Big Macs.\n  \nFinally I'd like to point out CARG.  What's going on there?  Nothing.  Nothing's going on there.  There's not really any sweeps.  But I like the chart.  It looks like a potential gap fill to $35.  The $30 and $35 strike calls for March are retardedly cheap.  And CAR just had a blowout earnings, so it could be sympathy with it.  They're clearly running the auto stocks - CAR, KAR, CVNA, and CARG, all popping on my scanner today, all day long.\n  \nNext on the block is what everyone's already heard - L brands (LB).  Yeah yeah they're selling Victoria's Secret, it's about to close, blah blah blah.  But earnings are coming up, too, and there was a big sweep on the $25 strike calls expiring this Friday.  And a nice volume on the $27's.  Do they close this week?  I have absolutely no idea.  But I followed it.\n  \n**This is not financial advice.  These are just things I saw in the market.  Do your own due diligence.  I'm not selling any of my contracts to anyone here.  In fact this post is a giant meme and should be laughed at.**", "created_utc": 1582168938, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6mq5x/you_like_options_heres_some_that_might_give_some/", "is_self": true}
