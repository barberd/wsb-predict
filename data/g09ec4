I do not own positions in USO and I will not feed you any plays. Any play you put together is a result of your own genius or stupidity.\n\n\n\nu/inb4ElonMusk has already given you the path of what actions [USO is taking this week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g05u87/uso_and_negative_roll_yields/)\n\nSo here you may be thinking to yourself, USO has to go up! USO $6C FDs! Oil prices have to rise since OPEC is cutting 10m Bbl a day! The rest of the G20 is cutting another 5M! Saudi and Kuwait are cutting another 2m Bbl! and we're gonna round up to 20m!\n\n\n[**This number is Fake and Gay**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-12/oil-price-war-ends-with-historic-opec-deal-to-cut-production)\n\n\n* Without getting into whether or not the OPEC cut is actually going to happen, look at the timeframe. May-June. This means that for the **balance of April** OPEC is still big dick pumping in and out of the oil holes (Like your wife's boyfriend Derek before he goes back work at the shop). Real cutbacks likely won't start taking effect until Mid-May to early June.\n\n\n* The US/Canada/Brazil are signing up for 3.7m Bbl in cuts. this is about a 20-25% production cut, but is unenforcable. Instead, the US portion will likely come from companies that go bust and stop producing, as demand has shriveled like your dick when you see your wife's boyfriend Derek pulling up in his Jeep Wrangler. Timeframe: End of Year (for cuts, not Derek)\n\n\n* I don't feel like explaining this, so: [Is USO a good way to invest in oil?](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/081116/uso-good-way-invest-oil-uso.asp)\n\n\n* For those with USO calls: you're hoping for backwardation in the oil market. Unfortunately for you, [We've been in a period of Contago that will be hard to unwind](https://www.reuters.com/article/global-oil-tankers/oil-held-in-storage-at-sea-approaching-2009-record-as-glut-builds-up-idUSL8N2BP4OA)\n\n\n* Even mild retards know that WTI and Brent are somewhat disconnected. WTI is suffering pressure from even more [landlocked US production that has no pipeline access](https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/3/27/oil-at-historic-lows-beginning-to-force-shut-in-of-wells)\n\n\n* Compounding the problem, Refineries are sitting on plenty of crude, US gasoline supply is [at a historical high](https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/weekly/gasoline.php#tabs-stocks-us)     It's like when your wife won't even give you a simple handy because she's too sore from being plowed by Derek.\n\n\nI like to see everyone here make money (even Derek). In the end everyone here is a little guy trying to just get some tendies from the trough of the world market. Salud, mi familia.\n\n**Wrap up**\nThere's a lot more publicly available information out there that should inform your plays. Just remember: USO rises and falls based on what someone is willing to pay for **US** produced oil anywhere from 4-8 weeks out.\n\n\n*Edit1 for clarity on US cuts", "created_utc": 1586742567.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g09ec4/two_to_contango_uso_dd/", "is_self": true}
