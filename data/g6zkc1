{"id": "g6zkc1", "title": "A Smooth-Brained's Guide To Oil, Futures, and USO", "selftext": "I've been seeing a lot of comments recently from smooth brains buying USO LEAPS and clearly not understanding how oil futures work or what USO actually consists of. Although I thought this was common knowledge, like apparently the DD I posted [last week about why $DB is fucked,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g58rkl/deutsche_bank_on_the_brink_of_insolvency/) some people apparently don't understand how any of this works. So today in Fun with Fundementals\u2122, I've decided to make a guide to explain what I hope is already obvious to 95% of you for the 5% of readers that still think buying long-dated USO calls is a good idea.\n\n**The Oil Market**\n\nWhen I write \"Oil\" here, I'm specifically talking about Crude Oil. This is the dinosaur juice that gets pumped out of the ground, but is also very useless until it is refined. Crude Oil is then used to make a variety of random shit, most notably petrol and jet fuel, but also for things like plastic, paint, fertilizers. To prevent oil producers from literally watering down their products when selling them, what \"Crude Oil\" is chemically is standardized so refiners know exactly what they're buying. Similar to measuring things, there's basically only two standards that people care about - WTI, which is used in the US, and Brent, which is used in basically every other country in the world. We're going to be talking about WTI Oil.\n\n**Oil Futures**\n\nIt takes a massive amount of capital expenditure and transportation to produce and deliver Crude Oil. To help hedge against price fluctuations, someone came up with the idea of selling their future oil so they have the confidence that there will be a buyer after they put in all the investment drilling and moving it, and so the futures contract was invented. Actually, futures contract was invented centuries before oil started trading, and is used for just about any commodity (except for onions, because it's literally illegal) like pigs and wheat. A futures contract is a contract obliging for the writer to deliver a set quantity of the commodity to the holder at a particular price at a specific date. These contracts could then be traded around up until the expiration date.\n\nFor WTI futures, it is a contractual agreement to deliver to the holder 1000 barrel of WTI at some specific date in Cushing, Oklahoma to a storage facility or pipeline. As many speculators also found out this week, it's also apparently a contractual obligation for the contract holder to take delivery of that amount of oil, leaving many bag holders to find themselves with May WTI contracts that now have a negative price as traders panic once they realize they had to take physical delivery of oil. WTI in particular was extra fucked because some genius decided to have the official delivery place of the oil contract in the middle of the continent far away from the oceans, making it impossible to bring it to a tanker ship to bring it somewhere else.\n\nThere's also different futures contracts for WTI oil for different months which may have different prices, so a price of oil in June can be cheaper or more expensive than the price of oil in July. When the price of a futures contract is more expensive the further out the date is, it's called contango, which is where oil futures are right now.\n\n**USO**\n\nNow that we've covered oil and its derivative, oil futures, let's talk about USO, an ETF that acts as the derivative of the derivative of WTI oil. Up until very recently, it tracked the price of the front month futures contract until 2 weeks before expiry, since they can't actually take delivery of oil as an ETF. After seeing May contracts go negative as well as a massive amount of retail investment money coming in causing them to hold more than 25% of front month contracts, USO decided to restructure to now hold futures of multiple months (as of right now they hold June, July, Aug, and Sept contracts).\n\nSo, every month USO will need to sell most of their contracts to buy contracts 1 more month in advance. For example, if they want to hold 50% of their assets in contracts for 2 months in the future (i.e. July), in a few weeks they will need to sell most of those July contracts and use that money to buy more August contracts. Since we are in contango, this means that those August contracts will be more expensive than the July contracts that got sold. This results in the amount of oil futures that 1 share of USO will hold will go down over time. Another way you can think about this is that the premium between the August and July contract is the price of storing a barrel of oil somewhere for a month, since you could hypothetically just sell a contract for July and buy an August contract if you wanted to find a place to store your oil between those months. USO is basically continuously devaluing because it needs to pay to store all the oil it is holding in futures. As the price of an ETF usually\\* closely tracks the NAV due to arbitrage from creations and redemptions, this also means there will be downwards pressure on the price of USO over time, sort of like Theta in your SPY puts.\n\n\\*A few days ago, due to some SEC bureaucracy, this is no longer true temporarily for USO, and the NAV differed from the price by over 36%. I talked more about this in my [previous post about USO](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5smyo/weird_stuff_going_on_with_uso/) and how you could have taken advantage of it, if you're curious.\n\nThis means that holding USO over the long term, or buying USO LEAP calls, is a bad idea unless you expect oil to absolutely skyrocket the next few months. On the other side, this also means that if you don't think that it will skyrocket, USO LEAP puts might print even if oil futures moves sideways or recovers slowly, as long as it remains in contango. Also, at this point you're literally buying the derivative of a derivative of a derivative of the price of oil, so the effect of the price of an actual barrel of an oil here isn't going to matter that much anymore.\n\nTLDR; You're still smooth brained if you still think holding USO or long-dated USO calls long term is a good idea, and maybe buy USO LEAP puts or better yet sell USO LEAP calls to have theta on your side if you think we're not going to recover anytime soon\n\nEDIT - PS: There's still a 9% NAV premium on USO", "created_utc": 1587692519.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6zkc1/a_smoothbraineds_guide_to_oil_futures_and_uso/", "is_self": true}
