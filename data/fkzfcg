When IV dropped, I sold out of the contracts and took the gains on the stock. I made some on the beautiful WELL put DD I got here. Submitted my own DD on RUSS going to moon to angry nay-sayers. Made some money on that. I made a play SPY Puts, and bailed out w/ a $4k win. I bought VXX and bought calls on VXX Friday. Ended up selling VXX for 25%, adding more cash, and buying more calls.\n\nCashed out during Trump's \"China Virus\" rant today when VXX peaked. :D\n\n+$10k and I'm cashing out and using this to pay last years cap gains. :D\n\nThank you Thank you Thank you. I really appreciate the time you guys put into making this subreddit actually useful. I enjoy the retarded assholes too.", "created_utc": 1584573563.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkzfcg/thanks_to_you_beautiful_fucking_autists_i_made_my/", "is_self": true}
