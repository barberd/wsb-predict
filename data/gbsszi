{"id": "gbsszi", "title": "Texas Railroad Comission - False hopes", "selftext": "TLDR; buy calls on long oil ETFs early next week, sell after the Texas Railroad Comission decision on May 5th and convert into puts \n\nIt's been a while since the negative oil prices on the 21sr and oil has been out of the limelight of Wall Street bets for quite some time. However, I believe there is a remarkable opportunity to make immense profits on some upcoming oil related news.\n\nThe Texas railroad commission has in the works a proposed 20% cut of Texas oil production up to one million barrels per day. Now, experts are sceptical of the actual efficacy this cut would have; however what really matters is the perception that it will improvethings for oil.  When this act is approved and I have little doubt it will be, oil prices will surge. However, if you carefully read the proposal you will realize that the oil production cuts will not take effect until June if the act is approved in May. Therefor, it will be too late to stop the overflowing of US oil storage capabilities in mid May and more negative oil prices.\n\nIn order to capitalize on this to the utmost, we should buy calls on long oil ETF's early next week. That once the production cut news hits on 5th and oil surges, sell your calls and immediately convert them into puts with an expiration of at least may 22nd, the next WTI futures contract settlement date or if possible June 21st (the subsequent contract)\n\nhttps://www.newswest9.com/mobile/article/news/state/texas-railroad-commission-proposes-cuts-to-oil-production/513-0f707cc9-b25c-4d16-9259-a60ac3409716", "created_utc": 1588375293.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gbsszi/texas_railroad_comission_false_hopes/", "is_self": true}
