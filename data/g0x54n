What\u2019s going to have a larger impact IMO is how forward-looking guidance stacks up against investor expectations. \n\nAccording to CNBC, \u201cThe Securities and Exchange Commission has told corporations that this earnings season is not routine and has encouraged companies to provide forward-looking guidance, and not be concerned that the information may change rapidly. This will make executives far more comfortable to comment freely on what is happening without fear the SEC will come down on them if they change their forecast a few weeks later. Expect a lot more detailed commentary.\u201d\n\nAt the surface this seems like a clearcut effort by the SEC to be more flexible in times of great uncertainty and to encourage transparency. To me though this seems like a warning to bears, that the SEC just greenlighted companies to give their stocks the old smoke & mirrors trump pump. Why give grounded forecasts when there\u2019s no repercussions for discussing guidance based on best case scenarios only.", "created_utc": 1586831453.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0x54n/guidance_leniency/", "is_self": true}
