Beijing would offer to buy more agricultural products in exchange without addressing any structural trade issues.\u00a0The *Financial Times*\u00a0reported that soybean purchases could increase by 10 million tons annually.\u00a0\n\nWalking out of the 13th round of trade talks without resolving any core issues and keeping tariff rates unchanged seems underwhelming compared to the complete deal that President Trump has been wanting. Nevertheless, there was some angst yesterday about those tariff-rate hikes taking effect this year.\n\nToday's economic calendar will feature the minutes from the FOMC's September meeting, which will be released at 2:00 p.m. ET.
