Before the virus hit, US markets were long over due for a correction (which is typically a 10% correction). Companies are overvalued and have been for some time now. Through a simple standard market cycle correction/consolidation about 3,000 points come off the top of the DOW. \n\nAdd to that the fact that China, Europe, Japan, &amp; Canada\u2019s economies were all slowing down, teetering, and/or in a recession prior to the virus hitting. Their first quarter 2020 numbers were terrible &amp; didn\u2019t inspire confidence. \n\nNow we deal with the ramifications of the virus that has de factor shut down the World\u2019s second largest economy, the world\u2019s largest manufacturer &amp; supply chain partner, and one of the largest globe\u2019s largest consumers/travelers. China was teetering badly before the virus hit.  \n\nForget about whether products will be manaufactured/created &amp; shipped to consumer, now the question is whether consumers will actually spend (e.g. travel, car purchases, home purchases, etc.) with the fear/panic gripping the world and its markets. If this is prolonged the question then becomes when do layoffs start (e.g. airlines, vacation companies, discretionary consumer spending,, etc.) ... This will only worsen  an already bad situation. \n\nSmart money has been cashed out for some time now. Everyone knew what was coming by mid-January. You don\u2019t lock down 250 million people under quarantine for a \u201cflu\u201d. You don\u2019t ban travel to/from a country for a \u201cflu\u201d.  You\u2019re a moron if you buys into this market before: (1) markets loses 10% off the top for a standard correction; and (2) global trade and consumer spending has stabilized, not grow but simply stabilize.", "created_utc": 1582553767, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f8rt2y/save_your_this_isnt_a_dip/", "is_self": true}
