{"id": "h0k0qs", "title": "The Bull Case for uCloudlink", "selftext": "UCloudlink, or UCL, IPO'd on the Nasdaq today opening at a price of 22 and quickly rising, and getting halted, at 24.5. From there, UCL tumbled down the rest of the day. For those who don't know, UCL is a Chinese Cloud Company with an extremely low float (2M shares). Recent IPOs have been performing extremely well such as VRM and ZI and the biggest takeaways I noticed from these stocks are how most of their gains come AH/Premarket. UCL got shit on today and I think there will be a nice recovery tomorrow. Their first day chart is damn near identical with that of ZI which has jumped 50% from their lows (32.1-50.3). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Buy UCL shares (Options aren't available yet), should rise dramatically AH and in the next several days.", "created_utc": 1591822551.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h0k0qs/the_bull_case_for_ucloudlink/", "is_self": true}
