Here\u2019s how we get our revenge:\n\nStep 1: Contact robinhood and get documentation of their shittiness. Documentation is key.\n\nStep 2: File a FINRA complaint - yes, I know there\u2019s a lot of words and you semiliterate autists may struggle, but this is important\n \nStep 3: Contact the SEC and file fraud charges\n \nStep 4: Whenever it\u2019s possible, get your cash (all $57 of it) out of Robinhood and switch to another platform like Etrade. There\u2019s probably 350k+ active RH accounts on this reddit, we can make them bleed red.\n\nLaw school/lawyer autists - we need to get a class action lawsuit going. This subreddit lost tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars from this fuckery, we need to fuck robinhood over.\n\nFuck Robinhood, once we get our money back we need to shame users who still use it.", "created_utc": 1583167830, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fcexj8/robinhood_fucked_us_lets_fuck_them_back/", "is_self": true}
