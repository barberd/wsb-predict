Up a few thousand from around 21k. Took a hard hit on ARWR last week, paper hands and panic sold. Also took way too big of a position based off some dumb DD. Made a comeback by selling CSOD last Friday for around 6k gains on RH and 2.3k on TDA Account. \n\nMade little to nothing from yesterday-today on CSCO. Could\u2019ve scalped 600ish profit but was greedy holding and sold at break even. Maybe paper hands who knows. \n\nNOW going into tomorrow, I\u2019m holding APPL BABA & BA puts and was up a lil over 2k at close. Never been team bear really but I\u2019m liking it. \n\nGod speed retards", "created_utc": 1589323149.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gim5nn/its_been_a_long_few_months/", "is_self": true}
