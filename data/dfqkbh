And two days prior, the baby firmly wearing the diaper was fed leftover Indian food.\n\n1.  UBER has no clear path to profitability.  The company has overspent on R&amp;D and self driving cars are still too far away.  The police unions and insurance companies all hate autonomous vehicles.  Remember WebVan and Pets.com?  They out kicked their coverage and so has UBER.\n\n2.  Drivers are too dumb to understand they are not actually making any money.  The depreciation and expenses they incur outpace their earnings.  If they were smart, they would incorporate and find favorable tax treatment.\n\n3.  UBER\u2019s insurance company just fired them.  Imagine having one client that is like 20% of all your revenue.  And you fired them because they \u201cwere not meeting your profit expectations.\u201d  That CEO has an ass raping coming.  And other firms will follow.\n\nLet\u2019s all gather around this dumpster fire, warm ourselves and prepare for the feast of Nov put tendies that await us.", "created_utc": 1570669511, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dfqkbh/uber_dd_and_dumpster_fire_gathering/", "is_self": true}
