{"id": "h0k5pa", "title": "DGLY and AAXN gains \u2014 post 3", "selftext": "- AAXN calls have been killing it, even in the bloody market today.\n\n- DGLY went down early in trading bc a lot of RH users didn\u2019t know the SPY could ever turn red (-0.4%) and flipped their shit but came back for a -7% for the day. Still up 200% for the last week, not bad. \n\nThings to note:\n\n- Trump is issuing an exec order in less than a week. \n- Body cams now have spoken and writen bipartisan support as of last night, holla. \n- Legislation *will* include funding for the cams. \n- GOP version (still with body cam funding) to be unveiled next week. \n\nI\u2019m putting 100% of my portfolio tomorrow into AAXN calls and DGLY shares if it looks good. The impending bill news headlines is bound to hit soon. Tired of losing money. \n\nCheers", "created_utc": 1591822945.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h0k5pa/dgly_and_aaxn_gains_post_3/", "is_self": true}
