{"id": "glre5t", "title": "My DD on why you should buy $PLT (Plantronics)", "selftext": "Hey retards, this is my first time doing one of these things, not really sure how to start but hear me the fuck out because I'm about to shill the fuck outta some company called poly or plantronics, whatever, the ticker is $PLT and that's all that matters. **$PLT 15c 6/19**\n\n**Plantronics** is a leading global designer, manufacturer, and marketer of lightweight communications headsets, audio solutions, telephone headset systems, other communication endpoints, and accessories for the business and consumer markets. They develop enhanced *communication* [products](https://www.poly.com/us/en/products) for *offices*, contact centers, mobile devices, cordless phones, computers and gaming consoles. So essentially they make communication equipment and electronics for offices.\n\nWho specifically do they make this communication equipment for? Idk, maybe some of the largest cloud based communication companies in the entire world right now.\n\n[Strategic Alliances](https://preview.redd.it/n07mgdhmkfz41.png?width=902&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6bcec9f49d0eec6b9a35e921fc661a17e8c9e34)\n\nNot only do they have contracts and specialized equipment developed for [Microsoft Teams](https://www.poly.com/us/en/solutions/platform/microsoft) , [Mother Fucking Zoom](https://www.poly.com/us/en/solutions/platform/zoom), [Five9](https://www.poly.com/us/en/solutions/platform/five9), [Amazon](https://poly.com/us/en/solutions/platform/amazon), and [Google](https://www.poly.com/us/en/solutions/platform/google) but they also have contracts with the largest employer in the United States - the [Federal Fucking Government](https://www.poly.com/us/en/solutions/industry/government) \\- specifically the [GSA](https://www.poly.com/us/en/solutions/industry/public-sector).\n\nWhy does that matter, because we're in a massive fucking pandemic, the entire world is closed and the company corporate work culture will probably never return to 'normal'. What does that mean, that means that people are working from home more now than ever, and people will continue to work from home in the foreseeable future ([check this link](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/5-ways-the-future-of-work-is-changing-due-to-coronavirus/), [and this one](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/29/how-the-coronavirus-pandemic-will-impact-the-future-of-work.html), [maybe even this one](https://www.wbur.org/bostonomix/2020/03/25/coronavirus-work-from-home-office-culture)). Corporations and the public sector, offices in general will downsize and people will continue to work from home. The demand for cloud-based conferences/tech and working from home is high and about to get a whole lot higher. AKA THE DEMAND FOR FUCKING PLANTRONICS PRODUCTS, YES EVEN THE STUPID SAVI 8200 HEADSET, IS ABOUT TO SKY ROCKET ITSELF OUT OF DEBT!! $$ FREE MONEY\n\nLets talk about **DEBT.** The only think downgrading Plantronics is their longterm Debt to Equity - 2.76. Scary right? Nope, wrong. Debt is scary to three kinds of people, BOOMERS, DOOMERS and POOR people. We're degenerative gamblers here, we embrace debt, we buy into debt, we are debt. Buy $PLT. I have $7000 worth of credit card debt and a $5000 default lightstream loan, am I'm afraid of debt, nope... that's what bankruptcy is for.\n\nSeriously though, why shouldn't you be afraid of Plantronics debt? The majority of their debt was accumulated in purchase of Polycom and their process of re-branding. They took in a whopping $700 million of net debt from their purchase in 18'. They're debt is on a current downtrend, from and overall $1.74 billion in 18' to their last reporting on Dec 19' of 1.62 billion, they also had a reported $171.1 million in cash, so their net debt currently stands at about $1.45 billion. Covid is hurting a ton of companies, but one industry it isn't is tech. Look at the success [Logitech is having](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/logi). If Plantronics never made another sale, this would be an issue, but with the current industry expectations, this isn't anything to be worried about. More sales will bring in more cash, and their debt will be neutralized... eventually.\n\n# PLT Earnings are expected on [5/27/2020](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/plt)\n\nThey were originally scheduled for 5/21, but AH on Friday they delayed to 5/27. Consensus is expecting shit earnings, nobody is expecting anything positive to come of their earnings report, especially after this earnings delay. Only a fool would play earnings, it's the ultimate [contrarian](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-theory/08/contrarian-investing.asp) play.\n\nExpected EPS is .09, down from last quarter. EPS are expected to be down, when demand for their products is expected to be up due to covid. If you look at their previous year's earnings, they're a profitable company. But they've been absolutely fucked by the [Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/05/01/1494397/0/en/Plantronics-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2018-Financial-Results.html) ( [https://taxfoundation.org/the-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-simplified-the-tax-filing-process-for-millions-of-americans/](https://taxfoundation.org/the-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-simplified-the-tax-filing-process-for-millions-of-americans/) )\n\n[2017 - 2018 EPS](https://preview.redd.it/o3foefhpefz41.png?width=731&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6404f5e6859bc3d1016ecffc1f64a2c28c327f5)\n\n[Income Tax](https://preview.redd.it/uq265szrefz41.png?width=692&format=png&auto=webp&s=775f8a26d58c6847102c2c5ba9426e7260294b71)\n\nPlantronic's revenue dipped in 2018 due to re-branding from the purchase of poly and the 2017 income tax pump, but their next report is going to announce a massive pump in revenue due to Covid-19. Plantronic's is fundamentally a profitable company, but on paper they look fuckin anemic. Not only will sales and revenue increase, in this quarter, but again, with the change of work force, their products will continue to be in demand.\n\n**Internet Traffic?**\n\n[**Plantonic's website traffic**](https://www.similarweb.com/website/poly.com#overview)\n\n[poly.com](https://preview.redd.it/1e7g25lyefz41.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=a30edb212e98b2931aeebb4ee505a474eac8ea6a)\n\n**Price Targets?**\n\n[Finviz - $18](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLT)\n\n[Marketbeat - $41](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/PLT/price-target/)\n\n[Investor Averages - $17.33](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/plt/analyst-research)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Technicals**\n\n[dum oversold- nearing market mover crossover](https://preview.redd.it/dkfct8liffz41.png?width=1230&format=png&auto=webp&s=909b1adebf4584b6d6a604797f7ad67cf77c7058)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[nearing MACD bullish crossover](https://preview.redd.it/uznp0rwzefz41.png?width=1308&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d189df3fe8bea76c8e9584e26dd697d8b0cadfc)\n\nTo conclude, $PLT is the ultimate Contrarian play, go against these Will Meade look-a-like hedge fund retards and look at my autistic DD I provided you guys above. It's literally free money. Worse that happens, you lose maybe $5-$6. The best that could happen, you listen to me, thehappyitalian, you make millions, tip me some of the money you make and you go out buy yourself a Tesla.\n\ntl;dr  **$PLT 15c 6/19**", "created_utc": 1589763423.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/glre5t/my_dd_on_why_you_should_buy_plt_plantronics/", "is_self": true}
