{"id": "eu8lcv", "title": "The missing factor", "selftext": "You've heard of technical analysis, that TA only works because of other investors are utalizing it, most investors even experienced fundamental traders understand basic support and resistance levels. \n\nI base some of my investment decisions based off of basic support and resistance levels, however we all know it's no real guarantee, just a good way to see \"okay people buy the stock around this price, and people sell the stock around this price.\" Good information to have, but no guarantee. \n\nNext we have Fundimental Analysis, we look into earnings, and other basics of the company, how much the stocks current price is based to it's value etc. (Price to earnings ; P/E ratio) \n\nThis is valuable information because we can see if the company is profitable or not, it's good information to have, a profitable company might conduct a buy back, or offer dividends, these are great to attract investors, but again no guarantee.\n\nSo what do we do now? Typical investors will factor in these two, and make an educated guess on the market.\n\nWell the real answer is stocks go up because people are buying it, and stocks go down because people are selling it.\n\nThats it, that's all that really matters. It doesn't matter about P/E ratio, TA, Moving Averages or anything else. \n\nNo one is factoring in the actual investors.\n\nAre other investors buying the stock, buy it, because that's the only way the stock will continue to go up, it's profitability and past technical indicators mean nothing.\n\nShake Shack, Beyond Meat, Nvidia, TSLA, ans now SPCE\n\nThese are all Meme stocks, now would I recommend buying SPCE, no there'snot enough Hype yet, give it a little bit to confirm that it's the new \"in\" stock.\n\nThe bottom line is, no one is factoring in the thing that actually matters, are a majority people buying the stock. Everything else is nonsense.", "created_utc": 1580055058, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eu8lcv/the_missing_factor/", "is_self": true}
