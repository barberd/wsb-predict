This isnt a high quality DD, the only reason I was watching it is because of the dude that said the shares could jump 100% like sears did when it declared bankruptcy. I can't say if the 0.5 05/22 calls are gonna print but im holding a thousand I bought at $0.01 This could be a 1000% return or -100% so join me if you want. JCP news could be about to come out(they have a deadline to file the bankruptcy claim), so YOLO with me!", "created_utc": 1589312329.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/giinff/10_million_shares_in_20_minutes/", "is_self": true}
