Bounced this week on their \u201cplan,\u201d due for a retread.  I figure 12.25 is all but guaranteed, 12.0 or lower is a definite possibility especially if retail is down as a whole.\n\nSome DD:  their next earnings is going to be a bloodbath (they said as much with that surprise guidance.). I am aware that they are significantly reducing the volume and variety they order from their vendors.  Earnings time this could go under 9.0 or even lower.  Cheap puts on deck, both short and long term.\n\n\nEnjoy the tendies.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b", "created_utc": 1582248233, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f73gl2/bbby_puts_tomorrow/", "is_self": true}
