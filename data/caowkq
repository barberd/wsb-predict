With all the talk about Fed cutting rates at the end of this month (July 31st press conference), at this point 25 is almost in the bag, 50 is maybe, 0 is less maybe. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I'm sure everyone has been cucked before on MU, NVDA, AMD, NKE, BBBY, AVGO etc based on their ***forward guidance****.* You can be right about the earnings/points move, but if you don't account for the forward guidance of the statement, you will see your small gain go bigly into the red. This is exactly why every Fed meeting now has a press conference, because the Fed knows at the zero lower bound, talking and jawboning is much more effective than actually moving the fed funds rate or whatever other tool. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, in these few weeks up to the Fed, listen to their guidance. Look for any trial balloons they put out (they most likely will be hawkish to gauge market reaction). Fed will 99.9% sure cut 25, so stop guessing will they/won't they. They are stuck between a rock and a hard place right now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm still all for SPX 3000.", "created_utc": 1562610700, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/caowkq/its_all_about_the_forward_guidance/", "is_self": true}
