Bezos isn\u2019t a pal of the GOP and is rich, being a potential scape goat/target for either party.\n\n\nI\u2019m not saying they\u2019ll crash or anything like that, but possibly a hefty fine or regulations pointed at them for who knows what is made up.\n\nSomething like AMZN 2,000p 1/15/21\n\n\nThoughts?", "created_utc": 1590592839.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/grln93/mid_term_amzn_puts/", "is_self": true}
