Why do DD when you can see what stocks people are heavily investing in? I post these daily. \n\n**Context \u2013**\n\nThe S&P 500 increased 1.5% today on the heels of a decline last week. The industrials sector increased by (+3.2%) and was lead by Boeing, which increased +14.4% (a pick from Friday). Companies are continuing to pull ads from Facebook amid controversy regarding inefficiently policing misinformation and hateful content. CoVID-19 was less of a focus today despite New Jersey, and California scaled back reopening efforts.  \n\n**Ticker :**  ON 19.515  0.425 ,( 2.23 %)  **Earnings :** 2020-08-06\n\n  **Name :** ON Semiconductor Corp.   **Sector :**Electronic Technology\n\n  **Special Considerations :**    **Industry :** Semiconductors \n\n**Option Information -**\n\n *Today\u2019s Option Volume:* 83293   *OptionOI:* 204060\n\n *ADV:* 10206     *Multiple of ADV:* 8\n\n *Total Calls:* 82574     *Total Puts:* 719\n\n ***Calls at Ask:*** **53.6 %**     *Calls at Bid:* 33.5 %  ***C/P Ratio:*** **114.8**\n\n *Puts at Ask:* 39.2 %    *Puts at Bid:* 43.7 %  \n\n**Notable Strikes :**\n\nJUL 17\u201920 21C had 53k VLM with 9.62k OI. 20C, 22C also had significant interest. \n\n**DarkPool Prints :**\n\nNone\n\n**News :**\n\nLast print was Jun 23-20, where the stock was upgraded to Overweight by Piper Sandler. \n\n**Company Summary :**\n\nON Semiconductor Corp. engages in the design, manufacture, and marketing of portfolio of semiconductor components.

The company was founded on August 4, 1999 and is headquartered in Phoenix, AZ. \n\n**My Impression :**\n\nTechnology sectors are poised to do well during the CoVID-19 era. The Calls at ASK % and C/P ratio are bullish. No news that I can find to support the significant option volume aggressively slanted to the call side. ON had a few large buys picked up on several UOA scanners, which likely accounts for a lot of the volume. It still seems like a good bet.", "created_utc": 1593465600.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hi932a/unusual_option_activity_for_june_29th_2020_on/", "is_self": true}
