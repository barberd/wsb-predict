It's clear that boomers are making a come back to the market. For the past three months, we have been taken for quite the ride. While stock market corrections are fairly common and bear markets inevitable, the current bear market is unlike anything we've ever seen before.\n\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has cost more than 39 million Americans their jobs, based on initial jobless claims filed over the previous nine weeks, and at one point, it erased 34% of the value of the S&P 500 in just 33 calendar days. It's the fastest bear-market correction Wall Street has ever witnessed.\n\nIn a broader sense, few sectors and industries have been spared from this weakness. But amid this market malaise, one industry is shining brighter than ever: gold mining. Why should you consider gold stocks as an investment for your own portfolio? It really boils down to the blossoming macro outlook for the shiny yellow metal and the improved balance sheets and operating efficiencies of certain gold-mining companies. On top of that, Gold stocks have lost about 15%-20% of it's value in the past couple months due to the bullish market. I'm convinced that boomers comeback combined with the next red day is going to cause a spike in gold stocks.\n\n**These gold stocks are ready for a rally:**\n\nIn theory, all gold stocks should benefit from rising gold prices. But not all gold stocks are created equal. Some have juicier margins or more attractive balance sheets or are phenomenal values relative to their peers.\n\nOne of the more obvious beneficiaries is royalty and streaming company **Wheaton Precious Metals** (NYSE:WPM). Wheaton provides cash to mining companies to aid in the build-out of a mine and in return receives a percentage of precious-metal output at a below-market cost. Wheaton then sells what it receives at market rates, thereby banking the difference as profit. This makes royalty and streaming companies the most sensitive to fluctuations in the underlying price of gold. Inclusive of all metals (gold, silver, and palladium), Wheaton's average cash cost was just $403 per gold equivalent ounce (GEO) in its most recent quarter, leading to a cash operating margin of $1,131 per GEO.\n\nIn terms of balance sheet, perhaps no company is as pristine as **Kirkland Lake Gold** (NYSE:KL). It ended the first quarter with $530.9 million in cash and no debt. What's more, Kirkland Lake spent $329.8 million to repurchase more than 9.7 million shares of stock during the quarter and doubled its quarterly dividend to $0.125. The recent acquisition of the Detour mine will boost Kirkland's 2020 production by around 50%, with the company's first-quarter AISC of $776 per ounce sold indicating a nearly $1,000 cash margin over current spot prices.\n\nAnd if value is your thing, **SSR Mining** (NASDAQ:SSRM) is the gold stock to consider. SSR Mining has outlined a plan to execute 30% production growth out of its Marigold mine between 2018 and 2022 and has generated record output from the Canadian Seabee mine every year since its 2016 acquisition. Recently, SSR Mining and Alacer Gold announced their intention to merge, which'll bring Alacer's high-growth Copler gold mine into the fold. All told, we're talking about a company that has well over $200 million in net cash that's valued at less than 8 times next year's cash flow.  \n\n\nMy positions: **KL 40c 7/17**  \n\n\nGood luck autists", "created_utc": 1590515721.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gr1yh6/gold_is_ready_for_its_next_rally_kl_wpm_ssrm_and/", "is_self": true}
