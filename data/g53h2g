That might make this the best investment you could ever make right now, at the risk of buying into a falling sledgehammer. I'm certainly considering picking up $500 to speculate on it. On the other hand, can the Fed really let US Oil die? That has some pretty interesting fallout, and puts american interests woefully at the hands of foreign powers regarding our recovery, and the fed had ALREADY announced and performed the craziest bonds market purchasing spree in history. There is really no reason to think they won't here as well. \n\nI would think either: \n\nAmerican oil company sells bonds, same as regular corporate bond strategy, and fed absorbs the bond to re-sell later when the oil industry picks back up. \n\nor \n\nFed buys oil for estimated appropriate market rate, somehow creates a contract that oil companies will buy the oil back when the wheels start turning with a tad bit of interest, and this keeps a good supply of oil coming out of the ground and provides the liquidity that oil companies need to try to float the gap. Basically making Oil Barrels the same as bonds. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhere it gets super interesting, is that drilling oil and selling oil to america is now an exacerbated financial aggression tactic, as (for example) Russia producing more oil keeps the prices down to stall the American recovery, and we really have no resources to punish anyone for doing it since we aren't a manufacturing economy that can withhold a necessary raw material to exert influence. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLooking forward, we really have a couple questions. All of this bluster over the next stimulus is just that, bluster. The honest answer is that they already know companies under a certain size or debt level aren't going to survive. Giving them money really just draws that process out. We've at least one post from a supposed banking industry loan processor for these, and they claimed they were given 'priorities' of sorts, implying that the money is being directed. This fits the theory that the blustering will be over exactly when intended. Democrats know that reopening the economy too soon will fuck us, and so will not opening. Thread the needle and all that, they'll capitulate in the end. I'd be surprised if it wasn't solved by Friday/Monday, and given history, it seems reasonable to expect a rally for a few days on that news. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSpeaking of rally, today was the biggest down we've seen in 'day' traffic (not including the gaps between hours), which implies the bots are seeing the trend as well. Given that volume is down, and we've had a few downs, and we're coming off a bit of a plateau, it seems very likely we could be starting a leg down. 95m in volume puts us back to Feb 19/20/21(48m/74m/114m) and , just as the crash really started. An increase in volume with a minor down day would be a very strong signal that people might try to bail before we crash off of oil, and given that the world runs on oil, that's a reasonable gamble. Oil will be an issue for the gov to figure out in short order how they're going to attack that, and I'd expect a couple down days until they figure it out. Give it too long, it could start a long down. American oil is already very expensive, we've already seen at least one shale oil go bankrupt, and this USO stuff could be enough to domino the bankruptcies there, Uncle Sam will forget small business stuff if it has to pick oil vs Sam's local snack shack. Tariffs on external oil might be necessary here, though I'm not sure what that does to our future relations with oil providers. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA decrease in volume tomorrow and a continued stall pattern would also be very bearish, as our general up will have decently stalled out. You might wonder, if high volume is bearish, and low volume is bearish, what is bullish? I think we'd want to see a higher volume (in trend, not expecting more than 10-15% higher here) and an upward gap or strong upward movement. I think we'll get that if we see the fed decide to buy oil somehow. 4 of the last 7 candles on the 1d chart have been uncertain dojis however, so it really does say things about the market not being very convinced. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMoving forward: I'll be hawking for any news I can hear on oil purchasing by the fed to figure out my next move. The market can look forward to 2021 all it wants, the world runs on oil now and jpow can't exactly print oil. That said, I expect rallies for the small business loan, the re-openings, and the potential $2k/month stimulus. If the re-openings go off without a rapid spike in new cases (2nd wave), oil should skyrocket. If it doesn't, I don't see how the US (specifically) oil companies don't go bankrupt without a nonstop fed printer, and that's when I see the big wave of bankruptcies start, as the fed focuses on larger institutions and US oil. Coffee, clothing, and boutique shops can be rebuilt. Digital companies (amazon, netflix, etc) should continue to out-perform their peers imo, until the actual crash. My very first prediction would be 60-90 days after we started seeing bankruptcies would be the big crash, and there were a few in  [u/Neat-Wolf](https://www.reddit.com/user/Neat-Wolf/) 's DD at the end of january. I don't like that they're the wrong industries, so I'm not sold on that yet, but we are getting on the 50 day mark for those. I expected it to really come out of the mortgage crisis, but rent deferment might mask that true date, tough to say. \n\nCut your losers and reverse your daily positions early in the day with your daily options, imo, we've been seeing a lot of wave/reversals on the daily charts in the last two weeks, and they should be fairly easy to ride on the 5 minute charts, assuming they're steep enough to beat decay. \n\nIf we start to see numbers bigger than -1.5% to +2%, in a single day, might be about time for Redbull. Good luck, and may your oil calls rain down 200x in the form of delicious tendies.", "created_utc": 1587423833.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g53h2g/i_shook_the_crystal_ball_it_was_filled_with_tea/", "is_self": true}
