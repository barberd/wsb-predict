{"id": "d22w7l", "title": "Market rotation", "selftext": "Market yesterday: SPY flat. V and MA were bleeding. There was a market rotation away from historically good companies. The reason is not clear, but many people here pointed out that it may have to to with the Fed meeting next week.\n\nSo I made this plot, which compares % changes of a few symbols against their performance in the aftermath of the last rate cut (computed by the percent change between July 25 and the closing of July 31).\n\nSome observations:\n\n\n- stocks that didn't lose a lot after the last rate cut benefit from the new rotation (except for ZM and WORK, which have been dropping before today)\n\n- PYPL, V, and MA have fallen significantly, but to the \"correct\" level. This suggests that their prices will stabilize.\n\n\n-CSCO and MSFT may still drop further. FB, INTC, IBM are not safe. NVDA, AMD, and AMZN are unclear since they tend to play in their own league.\n\n\nThe interpretation for this is simple: as the meeting approach, the market is unsure about the outcome, so people try to get as far as possible from the companies that suffered last July. PYPL, V, and MA were easy targets. Now that the drops of those are priced in, it's time to shutdown MSFT and IBM.", "created_utc": 1568091257, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d22w7l/market_rotation/", "is_self": true}
