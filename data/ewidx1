After modeling, it appears that whether you make money or not over the long term depends on luck/ when you invest. \n\nFor example... \n\nIf I invested $100 on 2/5/71 in QQQ I'd have $9,275 today. If I invested that in TQQQ I'd have $291,178. (a 10% CAGR vs. an 18% CAGR).\n\nI modeled it again right before the dot com bubble burst. \n\nIf I invested $100 on 1/3/00 in QQQ I'd have $224 today. If I invested that in TQQQ I'd have $27.
