It goes ex-div on the 4th. I have 105/110 for 9/20 meaning I bought the 105 calls and sold the 110 calls. If possible I\u2019d like to hold till expiration as I believe it will be above 110 by that time. I can\u2019t see why someone would exercise their right to by Jpm at 110 for the div when it\u2019s trading at 105, what am I missing here ?
