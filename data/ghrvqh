{"id": "ghrvqh", "title": "DDOG Fade", "selftext": "Hi guys,\n\nYou might remember me from the technical endorsement of Cloudflare I gave 2 days before earnings.  Like many of you, I was deep in NET calls, and was shocked to see a 12% drop after earnings that CRUSHED expectations.\n\nHere is my warning about Datadog (DDOG).  Like Cloudflare, it is excellent technology.  Long term, never bet against good tech.   Today, Cloudflare is back up around 6% at the time of this writing, and my 6/19 calls are regaining ground.\n\nThere are similarities between DDOG now and NET before its earnings.  DDOG is at ATHs.  It would need to CRUSH expectations to pop.  But Cloudflare also crushed expectations, and dropped.   This isn't a Twilio or Fastly case --those stocks were NOT ALREADY AT ATH when they had their crazy jumps.\n\nI am in on 5/15 50$ puts on DDOG.  Earnings will not beat expectations as much as they need, and will drop.  I will then be transitioning into DDOG 6/19 calls, which if you look at NET today, are printing.  If you want lower IV, go for NEWR puts.  They are essentially the same product and direct competitors, DDOG earnings will affect NEWR.\n\ntldr; significant parallels between DDOG and NET.  but DDOG puts today, then calls after earnings drop.  Look to NET as a similar example.", "created_utc": 1589217541.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghrvqh/ddog_fade/", "is_self": true}
