{"id": "fv7t7z", "title": "Funeral Stocks", "selftext": "Alright I\u2019m just a nobody on this thread however just wanted to shed a little light on what\u2019s going on. For background I am a former employee of a family run funeral home in Brooklyn NY. I currently am a police officer with the NYPD. My brother currently works at the same funeral home I was employed at. He has been working day and night while this whole COVID-19 has been going on. They currently have so many funerals going on that they are turning business away which is unheard of in the funeral industry. Not only that guys who do trade work (embalming of bodies to be put on display when a funeral home outsources the embalming process to an outside vendor) has been turning business away because of the influx of bodies going down here in NYC. I honestly feel SCI is worth a look by people that have much more knowledge on how stocks work then I do. Funerals yes typically have viewings which cost more money and add to revenue but the amount of people going down is high and I feel personally SCI will benefit from just funeral processing in general wanted to know if anyone has any input. Stay safe out there it\u2019s real.", "created_utc": 1586060636.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fv7t7z/funeral_stocks/", "is_self": true}
