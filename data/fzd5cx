I should buy into this - no way oil will be this cheap forever!\".\n\nFirst off, congratulations!\n\nDo you have your masters in finance? Because you just deduced the most important rule of investing: *buy the fucking dip*.\n\nNow, this is important, so say it with me out loud: \"**There. Is. No. Oil. You. Can. Buy. With. A. Stock. Ticker.\"**\n\nYep, that's right. You can't buy oil at say, $20/barrel and sell it at $50 without taking physical ownership of the barrels.\n\n**What this means for you**:\n\nYour USO calls aren't going to capture anywhere near the same return physical oil is going to see over the next few years.  In fact, your USO calls are kind of retarded, and that's ok.  Everybody and their mother thinks it's the best way to play oil in this market.\n\nSo, what can you do?  Let's chat.\n\n# Oil, Futures Contracts, and Doing the Contango\n\nThe way oil is predominantly traded is through **Futures Contracts**.  What are those?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*\"A futures contract is a legal agreement to buy or sell a particular commodity asset, or security at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future. Futures contracts are standardized for quality and quantity\u00a0to facilitate trading on a* [*futures exchange*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futuresexchange.asp)*. The buyer of a futures contract is taking on the obligation to buy and receive the underlying asset when the futures contract expires. The seller of the futures contract is taking on the obligation to provide and deliver the underlying asset at the expiration date.\"* [\\[1\\]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futurescontract.asp)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, these are kind of similar to options, except for the fact that there is *no actual option*.  What that means is, by entering into the contract, you have a *legal \\~fucking\\~ obligation to buy whatever that contract says*. Great, right?\n\nNo, not fucking great.  What the fuck are you going to do with 1,000 barrels of oil?  And no, [this oil](https://www.amazon.com/LubeLife-Personal-Lubricant-Lube-Parabens/dp/B07FMGNV51) and [this oil](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/energy/crude-oil/light-sweet-crude.html) are NOT the same thing. No playtime here.\n\nThe way these contracts work is you go to the futures and ask for a contract to buy oil at $25/barrel on May 1st.  Futures being futures, they're going to charge you a premium for that contract to purchase at a later date.  How much, you ask?  I don't fucking know, typically around $0.20/barrel.\n\nNow, these people selling you this premium, who are on the other side of the contract, are usually one of the commercials.  These are people who have literal tanks of oil, and by default, these guys are long oil and short futures contracts.\n\nSince you don't want 1,000 barrels of that gooey ooey fresh off the Saudi Prince's nutsack delivered courtesy of Bezos, you can ROLL these contract forward without taking physical ownership of that shit.\n\nSo, when you want to roll your May contract for a June contract, who is taking your May contract and selling you a June contract? It is one of these companies holding a shit ton of physical oil, aka the \"commercials\".\n\nUnder regular circumstances, these commercials are pretty happy to just take that $0.20 contract premium as profit and calling it a day.\n\n**Now, let's catch up to today's reality.**\n\nOil is fucking everywhere.  If you can store it, you're gonna be printing harder than Daddy Powell.\n\nSo these \"commercials\" KNOW they're in a position of power since they hold the commodity everyone *just knows* is going to be worth more by next year.  So they tell Mr. Special Retail Investor \"You want to roll your May contract to June? Yeah, normally it costs $0.20 for that, but today we're offering the nice price of $5.99 for the May-June Contract.\"\n\nWell, shit.  You're losing practically 1/3 of your investment just to roll that bad boy forward!  So you say to Mr. Oil guy \"No way buddy, you're ripping me off\".\n\nWell, remember that pesky \"*legal obligation\"* we discussed earlier? The commercials have you dead to rights.  If you don't roll that bad boy further, you get to take on a nice 1,000 drums of crude oil.  Nobody wants that shit.  Looks like you're gonna roll it forward after all!\n\nSay you went to grab one of these contracts today for $25 and sell in a few months for when oil is $40, you can still lose money on the trade due to these insane rolling premiums.\n\nThis is what we like to call contango in the commodities market.  What's contango, you say?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*\"Contango is a situation where the*\u00a0[*futures*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futures.asp)\u00a0*price of a*\u00a0[*commodity*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity.asp)\u00a0*is higher than the spot price. Contango usually occurs when an asset price is expected to rise over time. This results in an upward sloping forward curve.\"* [*\\[2\\]*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contango.asp)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere it is on a graph for you visually inclined folk:\n\n[5 Yr. Crude Oil Futures in Super Contango](https://preview.redd.it/4d4v4exhy7s41.png?width=1283&format=png&auto=webp&s=d746c8ec76ff5f4e39e381cfb8f2c2b7e5f2c539)\n\nRight now, crude oil is in *Super Contango*.  It's like regular contango, but special (like you!).\n\nNow, take another hard look at that graph above.  See how it picks up as you move to the right?  That's representing the expectation that oil will be worth more in the future.\n\n**The drop off on the right will continue to erode into future months as long as there are storage issues in the oil market**.  That means the people with storage space are going to be the people making the money in this oil market until the storage issues are fixed.\n\nSo, why am I telling you all of this shit?\n\nWell, ask yourself: \"W*ho holds all the power in this super contango world?\"*\n\nThat's right, it's the people with the ability to store oil.\n\nSo how do you trade this?\n\nWell, since all of this land storage is getting filled up as we speak, where are people going to start looking to store their oil?\n\n**Tanker ships.**\n\n# Boats and /CL Hoes\n\nIn addition to land storage, oil companies are looking to store their oil on the tanker ships used to transport their oil.\n\nThe owners of these ships see their value in being able to hold a metric fuckton of oil.\n\nJust take a look at the crude tanker rates over the past few months...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[2 Yr. Crude Tanker Rates ](https://preview.redd.it/gx4avwuby7s41.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=24b5249ce5782fc67048faa0afa55b0957c7f497)\n\nOil companies are basically buying oil at the spot rate, loading it on these ships, and buying futures contracts a few months out to lock in a higher price for the oil.\n\nOnce they load up the oil, the ship drops anchor and waits for those contracts to come due at the higher price.\n\nAs long as there's a scarcity of land storage for oil, these ships will be used more and more as storage.\n\nThese companies are buying the oil today for $20ish/barrel (the \"spot\" rate) and ***simultaneously*** buying a futures contract to sell in 4-5 months (or 4-5 yellow dots) later at a ***substantially higher price***\\*.\\*\n\nRemember that graph with all the pretty looking yellow dots? They're playing the rise in that curve.\n\nThese future prices are guaranteeing they can sell the oil in August for $32.50, or September for $35, etc.\n\nThe kicker is: oil can still be dirt fucking cheap in August or September, but they have a contract to sell that shit at a higher price. **No. Matter. What.**\n\nThere is ***zero speculative risk*** for these companies to take this oil, rent out a ship, and have them sit out in the ocean and increase the value of the oil on board.\n\nCheck out the crude oil futures spread from May to August:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[1 Yr. Light Crude Oil Futures Spreads: August 2020 - May 2020](https://preview.redd.it/9l9d6ao7z7s41.png?width=1275&format=png&auto=webp&s=337655bb795c8e3eee06808a0e899f15ec9780c3)\n\nBy August, they're literally making an extra 50% per barrel, just by sitting out in the ocean.\n\nThey don't even need to know what the future price of oil is going to be - the profit is locked in by the contract.\n\nBetter yet, if this spread gets wider - they just call the fucking captain and tell him to sit for another month to lock in even **MORE PROFIT,** ***STILL WITH ZERO SPECULATION!!!***\n\nAs this oil storage issue becomes more prevalent, these shipping companies can start charging more and more for their charters.\n\nHell, the CEO of EuroNav said they have the potential to earn profit greater than their market cap this year if the rates persist through the rest of 2020 [\\[3\\]](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4336704-euronavs-ceo-on-surging-rates-amid-coronavirus-oil-price-war-market-podcast-transcript).  For you \"special\" investors, that means their EPS will literally equal the share price.  That's fucking bonkers.\n\nThere's already a 25% percent increase in oil stored on ships [\\[4\\]](https://www.streetwisereports.com/article/2020/04/08/tankers-are-the-big-winners-of-the-2020-oil-crash.html), but there's still a lot of room (and time) for profit to be made.\n\nNow, if Russia and Saudi decide to quit sleeping in different bedrooms and end this price war, obviously the EPS won't be as attractive, but these companies are still setting up to rake in record profit.\n\nI believe this play is much more tangential than other oil plays and has a lot more room for profit. Not only do you get to play the contango, but you can also profit from both a low price of oil and a high price of oil.\n\nIf oil stays cheap, the ships print cash.  If oil gets expensive, the ships get back to moving this shit all over the world.  Win-Win.\n\n# Where to Invest\n\nThe most profitable ships for storage and shipping are the VLCC tankers, as they have a capacity of 2MM barrels of oil.\n\nThe companies with the greatest concentration of VLCC fleets are **DHT Holdings (DHT), Euronav (EURN), International Seaways (INSW) and Frontline (FRO)**. [\\[4\\]](https://www.streetwisereports.com/article/2020/04/08/tankers-are-the-big-winners-of-the-2020-oil-crash.html) Over the past month, their stocks have returned +38% for DHT, +21% for EURN, +20% for INSW, and +17% for FRO.\n\nThere's also boosted demand for midsize tonnage tankers, which hold between 1,000,000 and 750,000 barrels.  **Nordic American Tankers (NAT), Teekay Tankers (TNK) and Diamond S Shipping (DSSI)** have a lot of these bad boys.\n\n**This is going to be a longer play for me**, and I'm planning on holding for 1-2 earnings reports before selling off my positions, as long as oil stays cheap going into summer.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**TLDR:  Boats fuck.**\n\n**EURN $10C 8/21**\n\n**DHT $7C 10/16**\n\n**FRO $8C 10/16**\n\n**NAT $4C 10/16**\n\n**TNK $17.5C 11/20**\n\n**SPY $250P 6/19**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**DISCLAIMER:**\n\nI'm not a god damn expert on oil.  I'm an IB CRE analyst.  There are probably some glaring errors in my analysis. As always, do your own homework.\n\nThis may look like financial advice, this might even *feel* like financial advice, but this is ***definitely*** ***not financial advice***\\*.\\*", "created_utc": 1586629735.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fzd5cx/boats_and_oil_hoes_how_you_can_play_the_contango/", "is_self": true}
