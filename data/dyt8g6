Trying to decide what to pitch.  \n\n\nShould i pick a sexier small cap, or stick to something a little more well known like a mid cap with positive FCF/EPS/NI?\n\nWould you pick a stock upgraded by that firms research department? Or is that too gimmicky?\n\nWas thinking an A&amp;D company, diagnostic testing, or financial services / e-payments..   \n\n\nAll suggestions welcomed.", "created_utc": 1574207618, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dyt8g6/bb_interview_pitch_me_a_stock/", "is_self": true}
