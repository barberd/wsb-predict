{"id": "gv05tm", "title": "Five Below - going to drop hard on earnings", "selftext": "If you check my previous post history, I was spot on about LULU, even if people didn't like the DD because I posted it up a little late. That stock has exceeded my expectations. I figured I'd post a heads up about an overvalued company that I think will likely drop hard post earnings.\n\nI'm going to all in on puts before their earnings calls on June 9.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Company Summary:**\n\nFive Below is a company that markets itself to Karen and her kids. It's a discount retail store that is targeted towards producing goods for teens/tweens. The idea is that all of the goods are $5-10. Most of their growth throughout the last several years have been centered around store expansion, acceptable margins, stock buybacks, and an expectation that their existing stores will sustain the opening of new stores.\n\nComparable companies include Dollar Tree and Dollar General, however FIVE is no where nearly as established or fully mature.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Financial Statements:**\n\nNotable points from Q4 2019 ending in Jan:\n\n\\-Only 0.6% of comparable sales growth (stores that were open for the full fiscal year) implying their revenue growth strategy is heavily dependent on store expansions - very heavy on capital expenditures and ever increasing lease obligations. They aren't able to squeeze much more out of the stores that already exist.\n\n\\-Seasonal sales cycles. Q1-Q3 were each roughly 60-70% of revenue compared to Q4 which ended in Jan. The winter season makes up a huge chunk of their annual sales.\n\n\\-$261M\\~ in cash & CE going into Q1.\n\n\\-No long term debt aside from capital lease agreements & a revolving credit line\n\n\\-From their 10k: Expected minimum rents of $152M for 2020 or $38M/quarter\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EPS estimates:**\n\nCurrent estimates put them at -.21 EPS, which is a loss of $11.68M @ 55.6M shares outstanding . I have a good feeling it's going to be worse than this.\n\nConsider that sales are heavily seasonal so their most recent quarter is not indicative of the rest of the year.\n\nAssume they hit 50% of revenue from their best non-holiday quarter in 2019 - Q2 @ 417M w/ 35% margins\n\n$72.98M\n\nAssume SG&A costs dropped to 85% of 2019 Q3 (using this because Q4 was higher due to holiday surge) at $106M\n\n\\-90.1M\n\nThat leaves them at -17.12M for the quarter or -.31. This is with some optimistic projections that they are able to replicate their best quarter during covid with a total shutdown that occured from March-April.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is no strong online presence. The company does not list direct to consumer numbers, and their target demographic are not going to be looking to shop online at their store. They are too heavily dependent on walk ins for sales. If anyone has kids they know that they're visual and are not online shoppers. If a parent wants to shop for their kids online, they're going to Amazon like any sane person would with their free prime shipping.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Comparison to competition:**\n\nThere's a lot of optimism going forward for Five Below because of the of the \"recession proof\" feel for discount retailers - most notably Dollar General and Dollar Tree. I don't believe Five comes even close to either and will perform considerably worse both this quarter and in the long run.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-Revenue dependence on seasonal sales:\n\nDollar General has very stable year round revenue each quarter of about $6-7B with a nominal spike in the seasonal quarter. This quarter they did exceptionally well because the store is a \\*general\\* store and sells general household goods - not just junk or trinkets.\n\nDollar Tree is about the same but experiences a roughly 10% increase during the seasonal quarter compared to the rest of the year. This quarter they performed about the same as Q4 because they offer some basic household items.\n\nFive Below has a 30-40% increase in sales during the seasons compared to the rest of the fiscal year. The store has some household items for sale, but in general it's a kid focused store that offers mostly clothing, sports, decorations, and candy for sale.\n\n\\-Store numbers and availability:\n\n\\-Dollar General: 16,278. Look on a map and you'll find them everywhere in the states. They are especially predominant in smaller rural towns that aren't big enough to warrant a Walmart or large grocery chain. Anyone who has taken a road trip will know that you can find a Dollar General in even the tiniest outpost town. Additionally, post covid their stores close at 9-10 PM.\n\n\\-Dollar Tree: 15,288. The same with Dollar General. They are slightly more concentrated in the cities, but they can still be found in relatively small rural towns. Post covid, store hours have been 8-9 PM\n\n\\-Five Below: 900. They have practically no presence outside of cities which are also the most likely to be sensitive to distancing and cramped retail stores. Post covid, stores close at 7 PM. Leaving the least amount of time for a consumer to shop after normal work hours.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Forward looking:**\n\nOf course this is what the big boys will be caring about. Even if the EPS is off they will tell themselves it's priced in. Here is where the stock's trend prior to the covid collaspse comes into play. The growth of the company has been \\*entirely\\* based on more stores going up. From 2018-2019 they went from 750 to 900 stores. Almost all of their cash flow went into buybacks, store openings, and capex for a couple of distribution centers.\n\nWhat hasn't been flagged or created a stock drop was when they had to tap into a larger line of credit on 4/29 indicating that the collapse of their cash flows is going to be a problem to cover some overhead costs. Most likely going forward the rate of expansion is going to be thrown off as it'll take at least a year for revenue to bring back cash reserves to a healthy level without issuing new equity/debt. They haven't been able to squeeze more money out of their stores and any increase in margins has centered entirely around store openings to take advantage of shared advertising and corporate admin costs. They dropped roughly $96 mill for land in Texas & Georgia for new distribution centers (from their 10k) With the first quarter likely leaving them at $100M\\~ in cash going into Q2, they won't be able to expand nearly as rapidly. There is also no telling how bad covid is really going to get. While they may plan new store openings, it's unlikely to be a reality as any openings will take a year before they can get close to the same profitability as an established location. Since they are largely classified as a \"growth\" company, they need a reason to justify their high P/E ratio. No growth = correction incoming. It takes about 300k to open a new store, and until the store is capable of contributing to the profit line, it is just a drag with overhead costs. Until it becomes absolutely clear just how stable the \"reopening\" will be any outlook is pure speculation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI estimate that the stock will drop to about 85-90 after earnings. As it is now it's been floating around 102-106. I DO NOT recommend buying short dated until we get closer to earnings as the current market conditions are not favorable to any sort of short position until there's a very good reason for it and you will lose much of the premium you paid to theta. There might be drops here and there but for the most part the stock has been riding the high \"hopes\" of the reopening.\n\nThere is a possibility that the big boys have re-evaluated the price as it fell today against the index trend. If you do want to get in early, long date them so theta doesn't completely murder you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease be aware that any DD on WSB is advice you should take with a grain of salt. Also be aware that optimistic comments from the exec board could undo the realities of their balance sheet. If you feel skeptical, either hedge it with a spread or avoid altogether.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPositions: Once 6/9 hits (after hours call), I am going to all in 6/12 $100 puts.\n\nOther positions that currently have a lot of OI: 91p 6/12 - 92p 6/12 - 85p 6/19\n\nLong dated puts with heavy OI (possibly smart money or hedges): 55p 8/21 - 75p 8/21 - 110p 8/21", "created_utc": 1591070813.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gv05tm/five_below_going_to_drop_hard_on_earnings/", "is_self": true}
