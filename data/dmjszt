{"id": "dmjszt", "title": "Buy PDD Calls", "selftext": "PDD is an emerging Chinese ecomm platform that's grown a lot this year and is still undervalued, it's blown through all analyst predictions and is still climbing.  I've been playing the dips for a while and making a bundle on options but also own a lot of shares I bought in the low 20's.\n\nThey have earnings in November and I expect it to to keep climbing, though today's 9% gains (so far...) will probably get cut in half tomorrow.  The CEO recently said they've surpassed [JD.com](https://JD.com) in revenue which would be fucking huge if true (we'll know soon)\n\nI know it's a shit Chinese stock but it's also free money.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/nvdqhpehyiu31.png", "created_utc": 1571938663, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dmjszt/buy_pdd_calls/", "is_self": true}
