Cheap for a reason!\"\n\nNo shit. But that's why they can make tendies, retard (or am I the retard? Not sure). Now obviously, I'm not fully vaccinated and thinking of buying weeklies. However, long dated calls (eg. jan 2021) are looking attractive and I would expect the panic will to be over at that point. A lot of bad shit is priced in already. \n\nYou gotta realise that yes, people have to fucking travel. Cruise liners may be a different story though.
