{"id": "c0pg62", "title": "My First 2 Weeks With Options", "selftext": "I've had 4k and 5k gains and some small 0-1k losses with options over my first 2 weeks using them. I've bet 10k on some occasions. My biggest win was ADBE on Tues of the rally week, about 6k. Had I held entire week it would have been closer to 20k. Got 4k on BYND in 3 minutes. Lost some to CRM due to theta and no movement. I'm up about 4k overall, but despite that I'm done with options other than the occasional 100-1k gamble. \n\nThey're scary so I find myself selling asap, afraid they'll go to zero. And so far I've found that my quick trigger finger to get rid of them has helped me out. A couple times I could have lost a lot more by holding. I could be down 10k just as easily as up 4k. \n\nSame thing doesn't happen with stocks. I usually trade using 4x margin and after using options I consider 4x margin trading to be rather easy and responsible lol. It's easy to decide to only spend x amount in a particular stock while saving enough to average down if needed, all while keeping stock picks diverse enough to not get margin called. And with so much margin I can get 4k+ gains pretty often for less risk.\n\nMust say though, options can be a lot of fun but need to be used sparingly. Only options play I have right now is 6/21 CRM  call 155 strike 1k worth with plans to spend at most another 1k to average down if the stock dips to 146 or so, which I don't expect to have to do. If CRM moves like I think, it should be worth about $6 or more next week and I bought at .60. Worth 1k risk for 10k gain. I won't be playing any options other than this for awhile.", "created_utc": 1560547229, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c0pg62/my_first_2_weeks_with_options/", "is_self": true}
