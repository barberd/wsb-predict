Not their fault, just trying to stay off the streets.\n\nUnless *another* stimulus check arrives **before the end of May**, nobody will be able to afford rent. Spending on just about everything will drop drastically. JPow can dump all the trillions he wants into the big banks but the fact is that those same banks will be losing huge amounts of revenue come beginning of June.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeople stop buying new phones and electronics, puts on technology sector\n\nHospitals will have stocked up on supplies by then and the extra revenue from the rona will stop, puts on the over-inflated medical sector\n\niPhones won't be selling near as well in China now that 5g is already wide spread with supported phones being cheaper and state sponsored, and if their sales this year in US are any good I'll let each one of you gay bears fuck me raw\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis means SPY 06/19 240p\n\nAAPL 06/16 260p", "created_utc": 1587077186.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2pkl2/crash_will_happen_regardless_of_jpow_early_to_mid/", "is_self": true}
