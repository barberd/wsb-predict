{"id": "fffsmv", "title": "How can anyone economically view Corona virus as a bad thing? Aren't ya'll edumacated?", "selftext": "1) It'll gimp small economies harder than big economies.\n\n2) It'll gimp countries that take stricter measures harder than those that don't.\n\n3) It'll trim the fat off countries that don't fight it, it'll make them leaner and meaner.\n\n4) The vaccine will probably give autism, we are already vaccinated with autism 3-5 times in our child-hood, and extra shot could push some over the spectrum.\n\n5) Propaganda was legalized some time in the Obamas era. This shit is probably propaganda.\n\n6) If the 'trade war' was meant to hurt china, than a Corona virus is a donkey punch. How is this bad?\n\n7) The economy and the A.I. that trade are an emotionless artificial sapient life form. It cares not for the peasants that mine the stone, farm the wood, chop the trees. It needs money to buy priests to wolololo and shit. The Vatican will swoop in and use Religion to cure the virus. \n\n8) Did you see the footage of a troop of chinese storm troopers spraying streets with bleach? Americans bleach their assholes so much that the virus cannot thrive.\n\n9) Disease like this is our ONLY line of defense vs aliens. You've seen 'war of the world'? Corona is how we fuck up the aliens. Imagine ubducting a person now and they cough and shit all over the ship?\n\n10) How is quarantine at home bad for anyone? Working from home is 100% more efficient than at work. No stupid meetings, no water cooler talk, etc. Plus, people always complain work too much, well you can choose your own hours.\n\nPLUS, now everyone will be stuck home masterbating, porn stocks will spike, marijuna stocks will spike, fast food and everything will go up. \n\nOnly thing that goes down are the airlines, when people accidentally shoot them down, or they crash because of a software glitch.\n\nStop flying everywhere for a bit it's unnecessary. Save the money on your retard vacation and buy lube or something.\n\n40) \n\ntldr : When you gimp / handicap a group, it allows the most powerful to destroy the rest (economically wise). Just fast castle and boom, build army, then delete all your peasants.", "created_utc": 1583688629, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fffsmv/how_can_anyone_economically_view_corona_virus_as/", "is_self": true}
