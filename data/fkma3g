{"id": "fkma3g", "title": "$JNUG, Goldminers, and Gold Futures", "selftext": "Alright fucktards, take a seat.\nThis is going to be a discussion on what our autistic brains think about $JNUG and the futures of Gold. If you go and look at their chart, they have been getting totally shit on (like my $IAU 4/17 $16 Calls) and everywhere I read says to expect them to increase to crazy numbers over the next year. \n\n\nDUE DILIGENCE:\nSo, let\u2019s first start with the fact it is 3x Leveraged. This means that it is VERY volatile with the underlying asset (in this case, being Gold Mining companies). So, if they make it big, this makes is HUGE. \n\nSecond, Gold Bullion (the physical stuff for you autists) is and has been in a [shortage](https://m.dw.com/en/is-the-world-running-out-of-gold/a-47974833)for the passed couple years. \n\nOn top of that, the FED raising repos as well as literally [PRINTING MONEY](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-unleashes-commercial-paper-funding-to-support-nonbank-companies-144710054.html) will inevitably raise the prices of gold over the coming months. \n\nGold worth more? Means Mining Companies find more and use higher scale equipment etc because it is now in their best interest to. Gold is expected to be ~$2000 by next year. That\u2019s over a 20% increase in price!\n\nDISCUSSION:\nNow, here comes the things I\u2019d like to discuss about the above mentioned.\n\nWhat are the TRUE risks of buying long calls on $JNUG (or any 3x ETF for that matter)?\n\nWhat are your thoughts on $JNUG and Gold Mining companies expanding and growing with the increased price of gold?\n\nWhy would you NOT want to make a long call on $JNUG? \n\nHow long should you tend to play these 3x leveraged positions, and how far OTM?\n\n\nTLDR: Gold go uppies. Gold mining companies go uppies. 3x Leveraged ETF go WAAAAY uppies?\u00bf\n\n\nSTIKE/DATE: $JNUG 1/15/2021 $100 CALLS?\n\n\nGodspeed Retards. I think $JNUG is about to explode upward in the coming months.", "created_utc": 1584520253.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkma3g/jnug_goldminers_and_gold_futures/", "is_self": true}
