Whatever small gains I make get obliterated by the stock market gods because I make moves that are rational to me, but fundamentally retarded to any one with common sense. \n\nGet out of AMD while you can. I'll continue bagholding in the hopes that I can actually make money to afford groceries next month. \n\nIf I sell the calls tomorrow I'll let you know so you can inverse me and make $$ for yourselves.", "created_utc": 1582050853, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f5wctm/amd_has_peaked_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
