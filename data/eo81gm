{"id": "eo81gm", "title": "new short candidate: T", "selftext": "I am still invested in NFLX, PFE, and USO.  USO isn't looking too hot now, but I think it is at a very important area that will determine its trajectory for the medium term.\n\nIf you want to look at a stock that is very sensitive to rate rises, look at T.  It has a chart that was strong vs other stocks and major indicies BUT is now weak and getting weaker vs these same stocks.  T even got overbought against precious metals and both those assets are rate sensitive.  I plan to be looking to add to my short position in T in the coming weeks.  I posted about T possibly being a short candidate a few weeks ago, but now I see confirmation of the short trade.", "created_utc": 1578940025, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eo81gm/new_short_candidate_t/", "is_self": true}
