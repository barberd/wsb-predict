There is still an open interest of 35,000+ 5/15 25p, but HTHT is also overbought on the RSI today (\\~75 at time of writing). Further, it's showing unusual breakout activity on both the 6-week and 4-month channels ([pic, Webull](https://imgur.com/a/1xC8ru6)).\n\nCould this be a final pump before the dump? Only gyna knows.\n\nPositions: 50x 5/15 25p, partially filled @ 14x 0.05 a piece.", "created_utc": 1588176846.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gaccrt/htht_overbought_fancy_graph/", "is_self": true}
