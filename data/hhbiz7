I am also not invested in the market currently. I only day trade and don't hold contracts any further than two weeks out so take that for what you will.*\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#\"Stonks only go up\"  \nTrue. And when the fed is involved it's even more true.. and every single investor knows it. Do you think everyone beat the system and knows to go long now to make the gains of a lifetime from here on out? Stocks hit the bottom and now everyone knows it's time to invest long and collect right? Then why are there a good amount of big time investors sitting on the sidelines in cash? Why does that sound too good to be true?  \n&nbsp;\n\nBecause it is. And I'll show you why, when the market crashed, investors pulled out and stayed out. Why large amounts of money that was normally invested in the market is not there anymore, yet the market is/was continuing towards it's previous peak. Yes the fed has a lot to do with it but not forever. And yes many investors went right back into the market.. but I feel there's a reason some went back in and some didn't. They all know the same thing.. that's where my own theory will come in later.  \n&nbsp;\n\n(I recommend opening up the two pictures side by side and comparing if possible. Not sure how to do it on reddit)\nhttps://imgur.com/0SeNOka (1)  \nhttps://imgur.com/QaLKKY4 (2)  \nNow.. do these look pretty similar? What about the levels they decline at and if 2 was spaced out a little more or if 1 was condensed?  \n1 is 2008, 2 is 2020... but wait...  \nhttps://imgur.com/aFCaYrY (3)  \nhttps://imgur.com/crETYc7 (4)  \nNumber 3 is the top to bottom of the 2008 crash. 4 is the current year spaced out a bit more. 3 almost gets back to the previous ATH.. then leads to a horrendous year or so. I think we might be in the very beginning of a very long crash. Similar to 08 you had a bad initial crash that bounced back but then drowned out for a long time.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow lets compare another scenario.  \nhttps://imgur.com/GpUaBll (5)  \nhttps://imgur.com/mOMSc3F (6)  \nWhat about these? Do they look similar at all? Do you guys remember that whole depression thing back in 1929 like in pic 5? Compared to the current crash in pic 6? Do you think 1929 was the end of the drop in the stock market?... \nhttps://imgur.com/ZQZvT27 (7)  \n\n&nbsp;  \n\nNow there was fed intervention in 1929 during the depression but I wont account for that since trading/hedge funds (to my knowledge) weren't as main stream as it was now so I'm not going to compare that entire graph but lets compare the 2000, 2008, and 2020's crash.  \nhttps://imgur.com/c9iXxka (8)  \nhttps://imgur.com/KSJbwNB (9)  \nhttps://imgur.com/BbVuWqf (10)  \nNumber 8 is 2000, 9 is 2008, 10 is 2020. Do we think or does it look like for 2020, that it's the completion of the drop? Meaning it's going to line up with the bottoms of the other graphs? Or are we at the very beginning stages of the drop with much more to go?  \n  \n&nbsp;  \n\nBut... the fed! But... this isn't 1929! This isn't a financial crisis like in 2008! This isn't the dot com bubble, these tech companies make money now!  \n  \n&nbsp;\n\nThey do! But that's why we've been growing since the 2000s. That's why our stock market has doubled since 2008. What if I told you we're in a tech bubble, financial crisis, and asset crisis fueled and supported by the fed for over 10 years? That tech IS over valuated. That many sectors are propped up by debt and inflated share prices? That the debt we have accumulated over the last decade has translated into an economy that's 30% zombie companies propped up by debt while the rest either lack growth and profitability or are inflated.  \n  \n&nbsp;  \n  \nDebt is not a bad thing until you need to pay your bills. Until your GDP needs to be proven growing to show you're good for your debt. To be capable of raising taxes to reduce the gap of that debt. We have yet to see when the global reserve currency becomes questioned on the debt so that's something I can't really show or have proof that there's a limit but.. I can see what effects it has had on the economy ever since 2008. To use debt as a stimulant in expectations that it will come out stronger, remember STRONGER, than it was before to fulfill that debt.  \n  \n&nbsp;  \n  \nBut the fed never stopped. QE never really stopped. The repo never really stopped. We've been artificially bumping our market ever since the crash in 2008. We have yet to really allow the market to be corrected naturally. The way this structure works is if the laggers are replaced or remodeled to allow for greater growth. The fed has prevented that and I use this as my own gauge as to where we could potentially be going if all this is true and comes to fruition. Where the market could go if all these factors stop coming into play and for the business cycle to take it's course.  \nhttps://imgur.com/fkmEj8d  \n  \nYea... I'm thinking we belong at the 220-180 level or lower. I know.. I'm insane... but to me it makes sense. And why did we happen to go down to that same level of support last seen in 2017?  \n  \n&nbsp;  \n  \n\n\"But the fed! They wont let it drop any further than that and we'll be on the way back up!\"  \nI feel it's too late for that. In 2008 the fed came in a little bit late with their assistance but once they intervened, it was up from there. The crash was practically finished with and then the fed came in. This time, the fed came in immediately and went really hard, really fast. With that action, I don't feel they can propel us through this. They intervened to prevent the drop and wont be able to really help after. I think we drop naturally now.  \n  \n&nbsp;  \n  \n\"Then why haven't we already plummeted and reached new lows?\"  \nThis is where my other theory comes in. This is something I believe is going on right now and I'm worried if it is.. we might be in some really big trouble. Really big.  \n\n&nbsp;  \n  \n+Media Bias Theory   \nBe very cautious of the information that's coming from the ones on TV and online giving us information. There are a lot of good voices but some that are in it to cash out while we all hold the bag. I have a feeling that everyone got hit when the crash happened in March. All retail and big time investors took a hit but when the fed began interjecting immediately, investors jumped in hard. In turn it made retail jump in hard as well and the fomo/emotional buying and \"V\" shape recovery hopes came into the market.  \n  \n&nbsp;  \n  \nThe big money knows this play and has seen it before in 2008. They saw the fed come in and what happened. How quickly the market reacted and the boom began. But that was after the crash had done all the damage. That was when the economy had the ability for growth along with that debt. The fed acted too strongly, too quick, and are going to burn themselves out if they haven't already. Big money wants retail to continue buying into the market in hopes of a continued recovery while MMs slowly sell off their positions. They want us to hold the bag when this whole thing topples over. If the graphs above come to fruition and around that ~200 range is where we are supposed to be, that's a lot of bags to be holding. And the ones in the media know this too. They've been around way too long to not know how this will play out. Tech is way too overvalued even with everyone solely using their services. I think they're using that as the go-to play to get people to continue investing while they sell off. It's the market stays in limbo between ranges for so long right now. They're selling off while the narrative is to buy in.. until the inevitable.", "created_utc": 1593336441.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hhbiz7/bobstyle_theorycrafting_ta/", "is_self": true}
