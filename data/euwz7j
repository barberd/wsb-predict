They closed 5% in the green today despite the beer panic, they are up nearly 10% the last week and up 50% over 3 months. Explain THAT bear gang.\n\nIdk about you guys, but this seems like a no brainer to me. SPCE may be going to the moon, but DEAC is defying gravity!\n\nForget that they don't have a PE, or a market cap. It's all irrelevant as long as I see a green line going north in these trying times.\n\nBuy DEAC and we can beat the bear's brush with victory.", "created_utc": 1580169334, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/euwz7j/deac_is_beating_the_beer_virus/", "is_self": true}
