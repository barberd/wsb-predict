{"id": "gd1t2g", "title": "DDDD - The Rise of \u201cBuy the Dip\u201d Retail Investors and Why Another Crash Is Imminent", "selftext": "In this week's edition of DDDD (Data-driven DD), I'll be going over the real reason why we have been seeing a rally for the past few weeks, defying all logic and fundamentals - retail investors. We'll look into several data sets to see how retail interest in stock markets have reached record levels in the past few weeks, how this affected stock prices, and why we've most likely seen the top at this point, unless we see one of the \"positive catalysts\" that I mentioned in my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9h9np/an_indepth_look_into_the_next_few_weeks/), which is unlikely (except for more news about Remdesivir).\n\n*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so; look at what happened to all the SPY 220p 4/17 bag holders. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*\n\n**Inspiration**\n\nMost people who know me personally know that I spend an unhealthy amount of my free time in finance and trading as a hobby, even competing in paper options trading competitions when I was in high school. A few weeks ago, I had a friend ask if he could call me because he just installed Robinhood and wanted to buy SPY puts after seeing everyone on r/wallstreetbets post gains posts from all the tendies they\u2019ve made from their SPY puts. The problem was, he actually didn\u2019t understand how options worked at all, and needed a thorough explanation about how options are priced, what strike prices and expiration dates mean, and what the right strategy to buying options are. That\u2019s how I knew we were at the euphoria stage of buying SPY puts - it\u2019s when dumb money starts to pour in, and people start buying securities because they see everyone else making money and they want in, even if they have no idea what they\u2019re buying, and price becomes dislocated from fundementals. Sure enough, less than a week later, we started the bull rally that we are currently in. Bubbles are formed when people buy something not because of logic or even gut feeling, but when people who previously weren\u2019t involved see their dumb neighbors make tons of money from it, and they don\u2019t want to miss out.\n\nA few days ago, I started getting questions from other friends about what stocks they should buy and if I thought something was a good investment. That inspired me to dig a bit deeper to see how many other people are thinking the same thing.\n\n**Data**\n\nEver since March, we\u2019ve seen an unprecedented amount of money pour into the stock market from retail investors.\n\n*Google Search Trends*\n\n[\\\\\"what stock should I buy\\\\\" Google Trends 2004 - 2020](https://preview.redd.it/rukezaikanw41.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=56be6b3f25917a54f05814844117e741aeb6c9e5)\n\n[\\\\\"what stock should I buy\\\\\" Google Trends 12 months](https://preview.redd.it/faifdyjlanw41.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=80634928976262cad0bb18102968d2509786e3e9)\n\n[\\\\\"stocks\\\\\" Google Trends 2004 - 2020](https://preview.redd.it/21v491mmanw41.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca7bdb2b3cc8e6b25c40569c35f206365cb3a597)\n\n[\\\\\"stocks\\\\\" Google Trends 12 months](https://preview.redd.it/mqicwclnanw41.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=13ceadd359e81a82bdca4395aa4e1a76eed9a800)\n\n*Brokerage data*\n\n[Robinhood SPY holders](https://preview.redd.it/4fx6ec9panw41.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b38fc2d7faf7fdea56eb7698eb8b7a6e5cc260d)\n\n[\\\\\"Robinhood\\\\\" Google Trends 12 months](https://preview.redd.it/1xnrsjwpanw41.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=de52ebd13e9a25fee96ac34ca903f69a0d796a0b)\n\n[r\\/wallstreetbets' favorite broker Google Trends 12 months](https://preview.redd.it/gvf6exvqanw41.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc09e22c19e82bd1ce9949b15ad6e82e38acf6b0)\n\n[Excerpt from E\\*Trade earnings statement](https://preview.redd.it/75r8mmfranw41.png?width=1288&format=png&auto=webp&s=35c7bb029b9b09d007b43656f8355e375dbb9bc7)\n\n[Excerpt from Schwab earnings statement](https://preview.redd.it/mu6gtl4sanw41.png?width=1338&format=png&auto=webp&s=1023d826f1c8f07c7e5634bfa555b5871c397503)\n\n[TD Ameritrade Excerpt](https://preview.redd.it/cj8hs0usanw41.png?width=1274&format=png&auto=webp&s=aec8d817609bca0a4575757916fdac7ac2a13e30)\n\n*Media*\n\n[cnbc.com Alexa rank](https://preview.redd.it/csn42cbuanw41.png?width=1166&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf525dc0875e2ac450ea8069d3fe5ddd735598bc)\n\n[CNBC viewership & rankings](https://preview.redd.it/0b6gdtvuanw41.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f339c3425a8d6c5d3810dcdb0605271b8197af7)\n\n[r\\/wallstreetbets comments \\/ day](https://preview.redd.it/sxhl8lkvanw41.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=97154cc36fdd3a68bb22b9b5fd3e4a45f68c5e02)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[r\\/investing comments \\/ day](https://preview.redd.it/12mum4mwanw41.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=12710f1ac2874e997ccf308198700d2cf96f81bc)\n\n**Analysis**\n\nWhat we can see from Reddit numbers, Google Trends, and CNBC stats is that in between the first week of March and first week of April, we see a massive inflow of retail interest in the stock market. Not only that, but this inflow of interest is coming from all age cohorts, from internet-using Zoomers to TV-watching Boomers. Robinhood SPY holdings and earnings reports from E\\*Trade, TD Ameritrade, and Schwab have also all confirmed record numbers of new clients, number of trades, and assets. There\u2019s something interesting going on if you look closer at the numbers. The numbers growth in brokers for designed for \u201cless sophisticated\u201d investors (i.e. Robinhood and E\\*Trade) are much larger than for real brokers (i.e. Schwab and Ameritrade). This implies that the record number of new users and trade volume is coming from dumb money. The numbers shown here only really apply to the US and Canada, but [there\u2019s also data](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20200501001500320&sa=D&ust=1588551355924000) to suggest that there\u2019s also record numbers of foreign investors pouring money into the US stock market as well.\n\nHowever, after the third week of March, we see the interest start to slowly decline and plateau, indicating that we probably have seen most of those new investors who wanted to have a long position in the market do so.\n\n[SPX daily](https://preview.redd.it/osfyqpsxanw41.png?width=1516&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a33eb891f68ae9558b0deea59b5283a50e2392c)\n\n**Rationale**\n\nPretty much everything past this point is purely speculation, and isn\u2019t really backed up by any solid data so take whatever I say here with a cup of salt. We could see from the graph that new investor interest started with the first bull trap we saw in the initial decline from early March, and peaking right after the end of the crash in March. So it would be fair to guess that we\u2019re seeing a record amount of interest in the stock market from a \u201cbuy the dip\u201d mentality, especially from Robinhood-using Millennials. Here\u2019s a few points on my rationalization of this behavior, based on very weak anecdotal evidence\n\n* They missed out of their chance of getting in the stock market at the start of the bull market that happened at the end of 2009\n* They\u2019ve all seen the stock market make record gains throughout their adult lives, but believing that the market might be overheated, they were waiting for a crash\n* Most of them have gotten towards the stage of their lives where they actually have some savings and can finally put some money aside for investments\n* This stock market crash seems like their once-in-a-decade opportunity that they\u2019ve been waiting for, so everyone jumped in\n* Everyone\u2019s stuck at their homes with vast amounts of unexpected free time on their hands\n\nMost of these new investors got their first taste in the market near the bottom, and probably made some nice returns. Of course, since they didn\u2019t know what they were doing, they probably put a very small amount of money at first, but after seeing a 10% return over one week, validating that maybe they do know something, they decide to slowly pour in more and more of their life savings. That\u2019s what\u2019s been fueling this bull market.\n\n**Sentiment & Magic Crayons**\n\n[As I mentioned previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fyvnxt/what_happened_and_why_markets_seem_irrational/), this bull rally will keep going until enough bears convert to bulls. Markets go up when the amount of new bullish positions outnumber the amount of new bearish positions, and vice versa. Record amounts of new investors, who previously never held a position in the market before, fueled the bullish side of this equation, despite all the negative data that has come out and dislocating the price from fundamentals. All the smart money that was shorting the markets saw this happening, and flipped to become bulls because you don\u2019t fight the trend, even if the trend doesn\u2019t reflect reality.\n\nFrom the data shown above, we can see new investor interest growth has started declining since mid March and started stagnating in early April. The declining volume in SPY since mid-March confirms this. That means, once the sentiment of the new retail investors starts to turn bearish, and everyone figures out how much the stocks they\u2019re holding are really worth, another sell-off will begin. I\u2019ve seen something very similar to this a few years ago with Bitcoin. Near the end of 2017, Bitcoin started to become mainstream and saw a flood of retail investors suddenly signing up for Coinbase (i.e. Robinhood) accounts and buying Bitcoin without actually understanding what it is and how it works. Suddenly everyone, from co-workers to grandparents, starts talking about Bitcoin and might have thrown a few thousand dollars into it. This appears to be a very similar parallel to what\u2019s going on right now. Of course there\u2019s differences here in that equities have an intrinsic value, although many of them have gone way above what they should be intrinsically worth, and the vast majority of retail investors don\u2019t understand how to value companies. Then, during December, when people started thinking that the market was getting a bit overheated, some started taking their profits, and that\u2019s when the prices crashed violently. This flip in sentiment now look like it has started with equities.\n\n[SPY daily](https://preview.redd.it/bqum76v3bnw41.png?width=1302&format=png&auto=webp&s=6298a6e803153392d7f4933575d5d94568543940)\n\nTechnical Analysis, or magic crayons, is a discipline in finance that uses statistical analysis to predict market trends based on market sentiment. Of course, a lot of this is hand-wavy and is very subjective; two people doing TA on the same price history can end up getting opposite results, so TA should always be taken with a grain of salt and ideally be backed with underlying justification and not be blindly followed. In fact, I\u2019ve since corrected the ascending wedge I had on SPY since my last post since this new wedge is a better fit for the new trading data.\n\nThere\u2019s a few things going on in this chart. The entire bull rally we\u2019ve had since the lows can be modelled using a rising wedge. This is a pattern where there is a convergence of a rising support and resistance trendline, along with falling volume. This indicates a slow decline in net bullish sentiment with investors, with smaller and smaller upside after each bounce off the support until it hits a resistance. The smaller the bounces, the less bullish investors are. When the bearish sentiment takes over across investors, the price breaks below this wedge - a breakdown, and indicates a start of another downtrend.\n\nThis happened when the wedge hit resistance at around 293, which is around the same price as the 200 day moving average, the 62% retracement (considered to be the upper bound of a bull trap), and a price level that acted as a support and resistance throughout 2019. The fact that it gapped down to break this wedge is also a strong signal, indicating a sudden swing in investor sentiment overnight. The volume of the break down also broke the downwards trend of volume we\u2019ve had since the beginning of the bull rally, indicating a sudden surge of people selling their shares. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that we will go straight from here, and I personally think that we will see the completion of a heads-and-shoulders pattern complete before SPY goes below 274, which in itself is a strong support level. In other words, SPY might go from 282 -> 274 -> 284 -> 274 before breaking the 274 support level.\n\n[VIX Daily](https://preview.redd.it/4370jo35bnw41.png?width=966&format=png&auto=webp&s=f846c1300307737498398dbafcb8d90eb2cd66b1)\n\nDoing TA is already sketchy, and doing TA on something like VIX is even more sketchy, but I found this interesting so I\u2019ll mention it. Since the start of the bull rally, we\u2019ve had VIX inside a descending channel. With the breakdown we had in SPY yesterday, VIX has also gapped up to have a breakout from this channel, indicating that we may see future volatility in the next week or so.\n\n**Putting Everything Together**\n\nFinally, we get to my thesis. This entire bull rally has been fueled by new retail investors buying the dip, bringing the stock price to euphoric levels. Over the past few weeks, we\u2019ve been seeing the people waiting at the sidelines for years to get into the stock market slowly FOMO into the rally in smaller and smaller volumes, while the smart money have been locking in their profits at an even slower rate - hence an ascending wedge. As the amount of new retail interest in the stock market started slowed down, the amount of new bulls started to decline. It looks like Friday might have been the start of the bearish sentiment taking over, meaning it\u2019s likely that 293 was the top, unless any significant bullish events happen in the next two weeks like a fourth round of stimulus, in which case we might see 300. This doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ll instantly go back to circuit breakers on Monday, and we might see 282 -> 274 -> 284 -> 274 happen before panic, this time by the first-time investors, eventually bringing us down [towards SPY 180](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fzmlsv/spy_1125_150p/).\n\ntldr; we've reached the top", "created_utc": 1588553359.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gd1t2g/dddd_the_rise_of_buy_the_dip_retail_investors_and/", "is_self": true}
