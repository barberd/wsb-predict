{"id": "gb4bki", "title": "SQ strategy", "selftext": "Here are my positions and thanks to the random guy from WSB that suggested to buy AAPL, i made a $200 gain. Trying slowly to recoup the $10k that i lost last month when i bought PUTS in uber and MSFT. I see that liquid and volatile stocks usually move up at the end of the trading hour before an earnings call.\n\nMy strategy here is to buy SQ calls tomorrow or on Monday (when IV is low) and sell it exactly between 3:45-3:55 pm on the day of earnings (5/6) when the IV spikes. This is an inverse of IV crush. I employed the same strategy for AAPL and made little money but want to go all in for SQ since this is a volatile stock. What do you guys think?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vjmelmf4t0w41.png?width=1272&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8bc7999f259ecf15bbd1af9ef458a01b6742d35", "created_utc": 1588280880.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gb4bki/sq_strategy/", "is_self": true}
