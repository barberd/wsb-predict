This is more to consolidate lots of information & sources I've found relevant over the last few days.\n\n[Basically, this is the home page where information is centralized for the COVID-19 in the U.S. per CDC.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)\n\nThese are graphed observations of tested cases via CDC & Public Health Labs:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4ro47mrncrm41.png?width=1951&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f824875336c4712bd825a07a8204c12d611bdf7\n\n(All subsequent information in this paragraph is quoted from and based on assumption that this information is correct from NBC article. \\[[article here](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/coronavirus-testing-information-covid-19-tests-according-state-health-departments-n1158041)\\]) Anyhow, almost every state requires that: \"Patients must meet the state\u2019s criteria to be tested.\" Some of these states include, but are not limited to: Alabama, Colorado, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, etc. In California, \"\\[For\\] a patient to be tested by a public health lab, their provider must contact the local public health department for approval and instructions.\" Florida's testing conditions are quoted as \\[to\\] \"...be prioritized for testing, patients must meet the state\u2019s criteria, which evaluates a combination of symptoms and risk factors. Their samples will be sent to the closest laboratory.\" **Most states prioritize certain individuals, and appear to put the power in the hands of your health care provider who will evaluate you \\[in-person\\] and determine if you should be considered for testing.**\n\nComparable Countries: Italy & South Korea. Why? [\"The democracies of Italy and South Korea are useful case studies for countries such as America, which have had problems setting up testing systems and are weeks behind on the infection curve.\"](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-response-specialre/italy-and-south-korea-virus-outbreaks-reveal-disparity-in-deaths-and-tactics-idUSKBN20Z27P) More of a broad and chronological take on both countries' responses to COVID-19. Nonetheless, a good article that grasps the scope of the effects on both both countries.\n\nFigures-wise: [\\[Figures-wise relating to global testing values can be found here - LINK 1\\]](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing-source-data). Anyhow, South Korea has conducted appx. 248,647 tests with confirmed cases amounting to 8,086 per [link here \\[LINK 2\\].](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) Italy has conducted about 86,011 tests \\[see LINK 1\\] with a confirmed 21,157 cases \\[see LINK 2\\]. And the U.S., has conducted a measly 13,624 tests, with the CDC labs conducting only about 3,903 of them - with a requested [FY 2020 Budget of $6.954.](https://www.cdc.gov/budget/documents/fy2020/cdc-overview-factsheet.pdf) Thanks CDC! We have \\[as of 03/15\\] a confirmed amount of 2,951 cases only whilst conducting about 64.4% of the tests Italy has done, and only 5.5% of the cases South Korea has done. All the while, people in my state are still working their day jobs, and schools are still not cancelled in many states.\n\nWhile Italy has nationally been on full lock-down, South Korea \\[per the Reuters article\\] has been a bit more intrusive in attempts to mitigate COVID-19: \"In addition to helping work out who to test, South Korea\u2019s data-driven system helps hospitals manage their pipeline of cases. People found positive are placed in self-quarantine and monitored remotely through a smartphone app, or checked regularly in telephone calls, until a hospital bed becomes available. When a bed is available, an ambulance picks the person up and takes the patient to a hospital with air-sealed isolation rooms. All of this, including hospitalization, is free of charge.\"\n\n**tl;dr** \ud83d\udc3b\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b\ud83c\udf08. The only things bears have to worry about is regulators stepping in and the incompetence of our healthcare industry/administration actually getting to the test. As the data suggests, the cases have just started to compound, and it might be days/weeks before publication happens at a massive enough scale to sink the markets. I am not one to talk about the capacity to which regulators could step into the markets; but if we don't drastically improve our testing circumstances and those subsequent publications - and then all this data were to hit at once (because I anticipate the U.S. having at least 5k-10k currently) - then, I would imagine regulators would step in and absolutely buttfuck the bears.\n\n**tl;dr the tl;dr** Everyone is fucked if testing conditions don't improve. \n\nSPY 2x5 190/230s 04/17", "created_utc": 1584247435.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fiw1au/how_testing_has_been_handled_across_comparable/", "is_self": true}
