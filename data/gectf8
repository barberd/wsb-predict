They dislike losing money.\n\nEvery day I get on reddit and see 100\u2019s of posts drooling over MVIS and NAT and X \u00c6 A-12 from the penny stocks community.\n\nThis has to end.\n\nA stock goes up 4 cents and people lose their god damn minds. The WSB community needs to come together to end this.\n\nAnytime a penny begins trending WSB needs to short the living shit out of it. No questions asked just suppress the life out of the stock. Honestly, I have no idea how this works just make the level II red. This is 100% fool proof.\n\nOnce the entire penny stock community has dried up from the WSB takeover, reddit will finally be at peace.\n\nYes, I\u2019m well aware I could simply leave or block those pages but that is way less complex than this idiotic scheme.", "created_utc": 1588737365.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gectf8/wsb_takes_over_the_penny_world/", "is_self": true}
