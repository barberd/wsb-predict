Not every company in the peripheral sector is as well positioned as Logitech. (i fuckin LOVE my RGB spark keyboard, spitting rainbows all day as I laugh at you bulls eating shit).\n\nLook at PLT's conference call.\n\n> With that context, our Q1 guidance is as follows. We expect GAAP net revenues of $330 million to $365 million and our non-GAAP net revenues of $335 million to $370 million. Total adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $25 million to $45 million. And non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of a loss of $0.18 per share to a gain of $0.22 per share.\n\n> Finally, I'd like to mention that these guidance ranges include our estimates of the impact of factory overhead underutilization due to lower production volumes, incremental freight due to supply chain challenges and the cost of factory reconfiguration.\n\nLook at HPQ's sector revenue pullback.\n\n> Down 31% on commercial devices.\n\n> Down 15% on ink supplies.\n\n> Down 19% on printing division overall.\n\n> Down 16% on consumer hardware (despite 5% laptop uptick).\n\nDell is probably going to eat shit, but I'm guessing best case they'll trade sideways as they'll have an uptick on laptop purchases to offset any negative guidance. Oh btw, Dell's Chief of HR just dumped $1.8M in options on Tuesday cuz he's a gay bear just like the rest of us.\n\nHPQ\n17p 5/29, 16p 5/29, 14.5p 5/29(hahaaa these were 5 cents/ea), 17p 6/19\n\nDELL 40p 6/19\n\n\nReminder. Earnings reports are about GUIDANCE, not about record breaking quarterly past results. Nobody gives a fuck about EPS beats when guidance shits the bed.", "created_utc": 1590632216.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/grxinh/gay_bears_unite_dont_buy_consumer_tech_ers_short/", "is_self": true}
