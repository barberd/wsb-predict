{"id": "g2u7xv", "title": "FOMO -> stocks only go up", "selftext": "Hello there, my smooth-brained peers,\n\nIt feels like January 2019: the market is booming (up 30% in the last month), stocks only go up, there is some weird beerflu going around, but it's no big deal.\n\nWhy is that?  Investors are happy.  New cases seem to be declining, and the bottom is in.  Anecdotal evidence from other autists, friends, and family alike all suggest that everyone wants to get in the market.  The past three years of this bull run put the market on easy mode for everyone.  You could have literally rolled dice to pick tickers, and you would get insta profits.  The pussys on the sideline have been waiting for their entry in the market.  The chose the last few weeks to hop on J-Powell's train to tendie heaven, hence the rise in stonk.\n\nIt seems like anyone with half a brain knows that corona is actually a bad thing and will have a lasting effect on the world economy.  They are on the sideline.  The only people buying are FOMOing into obvious quarantine plays (AMZN, NFLX, ROKU) and bringing up the whole market on low volume.\n\nThe very people supporting our current pump are weak-minded and paper handed.  MMs, hedge funds, the big boys all know this.  We are in for another rug pull. I don't know when, but when your dipshit friend who asked you last week how to do a call option starts panic selling when he sees his first -3% day...F\n\nI think the story goes something like the top is when shoeshine boy asks how to get in the market.  Our shoeshine boy is Cam who is doing a 1000 to 1000000 challenge and the top is 292 tomorrow at 11:34pm.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: market is driven by normies FOMOing\n\njk stocks only go up, bears are gay, mods are too\n\nAMZN 2500c, NFLX 500c, ROKU 150c, MU 90c", "created_utc": 1587094582.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2u7xv/fomo_stocks_only_go_up/", "is_self": true}
