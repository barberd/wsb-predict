{"id": "btyuad", "title": "AMD News is priced in...", "selftext": "I literally know nothing about AMD and am pretty tech illiterate so take my advice with a grain of salt. I\u2019m seeing two camps around AMD: those who know technology who think AMD is going to be super hot and give intel a run for their money and those who think it\u2019s \u201cpRiCeD iN\u201d already.\n\nThis reminds me a lot of Dominos Pizza to be honest... Back at the tail end of the financial crisis, some friends of mine saw that Dominos (DPZ) had finally come to their senses and changed how they did business- they turned their production process and recipes on their head in order to actually make a product that people wanted to buy and weren\u2019t just \u201csatisfied that they bought a cheaper alternative to better pizza\u201d. Except for the pizza part, does this Sound familiar? \n\nSo anyway, DPZ had gone from $4 to $11 as they went from near bankrupt to actually competitive with a good product. We bought in at about $11 once the product was getting good feedback. We SOLD it at $13-14 after scalping a 20% gain. We figured the good news and the improved product was pRiCeD iN already, we had made our money, and the stock had essentially tripled in a year. \n\nWhoa were we wrong. Every time the stock doubled or tripled we said it was priced in already and there was no point in buying it back because the trend was likely over soon because pizza is competitive and there is no moat and well funded competitions...\n\nAnyway- this situation just reminded me of what I\u2019m seeing arguing about AMD. If they really are making a better product than the competition (I\u2019m too stupid to understand if that\u2019s true or not), ride the freaking wave.", "created_utc": 1559042549, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/btyuad/amd_news_is_priced_in/", "is_self": true}
