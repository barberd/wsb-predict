Make a movie. There is a population of WSBJ's who have the technology to make a feature length film. Stitch together our favorite memes. Lord of the Rings, The Big Short, Deep Throat, whatever. Make it Fetch. Make it make sense. Make a trailer. Charlie Sheen has Tiger Blood and AIDS blood. Cast him, he was in Margin Call. Use Platoon too. Piece together Keanu's or Leo's career into a story line for the times. We're living through history and I need it Disneyfied. Thanos Graphic Novel Virus. There are 46 movies within Marvel alone. Or Tom Hanks, because he had the virus and is in every good Tom Hanks movie I've ever seen. Coronavirus Studios. Studio 19. There's a lot of material. A lot of potential. I can't assume genres. One movie per quarter. Organize. Pick a strong female lead. I don't have the skills or the technology. You do it. Do it for history.  Here is a dumb Ken Burns doc on Coronavirus:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLuGSuz4Gxo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLuGSuz4Gxo)\n\nDisney puts... lets say... $20 in... October, fuck it why not wait six months. Why wouldn't Disney tank every quarter until a vaccine is discovered and people have money. $20 puts Oct 2021 if that doesn't work. Disney calls summer 2022 and on until the next crisis. Calls on WSB: tHe MOviE this summer.", "created_utc": 1586925721.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1l58l/wsb_the_movie/", "is_self": true}
