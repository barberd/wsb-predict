You literally won't step foot in that store unless you have a physical or online coupon and unless you saved one from the mail or you are a regular on their text messaging marketing and email marketing, you can't easily obtain one **instantly.** Yes, they are \"easily\" available if you wait for one, but if I want to get a 30% coupon right now so I can go get what I need and I don't already have one, I can't do that. That's the key problem here, unlike Kohls and JCP which operate on a similar \"mandatory coupon\" strategy, BBBY doesn't make their coupons as easy as a click like JCP and Kohls have plastered all over their websites. Same goes for the other major properties they own (Buy Buy Baby and Cost Plus). The other problem is most of their 30% coupons are for one single item, which is completely retarded. Kohls and JCP issue % off the entire purchase. It just makes it even harder to want to shop there, forget about the fact that even after 30% Amazon still beats them in price. I think the rationale is that they want you to sign up for a steady marketing stream to get their coupons but that's a relationship you can only have with customers if you sell unique goods. \n\nBBBY has NO proprietary brands. Kohls has shit like \"The Big One\" and \"Apt. 9\" and JCP has an in house brand, where they can leverage their \"names\" against shitty Chinese products and make a decent margin while still selling crappy goods. BBBY sells the same shit Amazon does with a huge barrier to entry (coupon) compared to the competition. They are basically asking you not to shop there.\n\nI think the only thing keeping this company afloat are wedding and baby registries and gift cards. I have hundreds in unused gift cards to this place because it's so damn difficult to make a purchase there that even with gift card money I won't pay their prices.\n\nThere is no point to this store.", "created_utc": 1578609969, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/emhfhl/my_take_on_why_bed_bath_and_beyond_is_doing_so/", "is_self": true}
