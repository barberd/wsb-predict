Here's why HD will beat all three.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Everyone is staying in and fixing their house, fixing up their yards, building shit for their kids,\n\n\\- Go to a Home Depot today and see for yourself. There's a lot more people than usual.\n\n\\- Search all the HD, WSB, stocks subreddits and see that they're killing quotas.\n\n**- This fiscal quarter is from February to end of April! People are worried that this upcoming earnings is Jan - Mar, giving HD only 1 months of stay at home. Not true! There's two full months of stay at home order in this earnings.
