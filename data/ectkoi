{"id": "ectkoi", "title": "Iron condor on FDX, what could I have done better?", "selftext": "The mods at /r/options keep deleting my post for some stupid reason, so I'm asking here.\n\nI want to start selling iron condors and the first one I traded was on FDX earnings.\n\n1) As earnings were AFC, I calculated the 1-day implied move as IV / sqrt(365). At that time, FDX was trading at around $162.\n\n2) I made the iron condor a little wider than the implied move, with the following trades to open:\n\nbuy 150 PUT, sell 152.5 PUT, sell 170 CALL, buy 172.5 CALL, all of them expiring on Dec 20.\n\nI got a credit of $103, and I had a POP of a little more than 60%.\n\nThe next day FDX opened at $151, right at my lower breakeven, and went even slightly higher for a moment, but I didn't have time to close the trade because I got at might computer a few minutes late and the movement was very fast.\n\nAt this point, I am not sure whether it makes sense to roll the lower spread or to wait for expiration. Currently it's sitting at -$118.\n\nThe rationale behind this trade was to take advantage of the reduction in volatility, which happened, but the directional movement was too strong.\n\nI am now wondering if it did make sense to make this trade (I didn't know too much about Fedex, that's why I chose a directionally neutral trade) and what could have done better.\n\nI also read that for earnings many suggest to use expiring contracts, like I did, but I am doubting that now. If I had selected contracts that were further away in time, I would have had higher vega to take advantage of the volatility crush, and also I would have had much more time for FDX to come closer to my breakeven points.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nP.S. I also don't quite understand why the performance profile gives -60 as the maximum loss at expiration. And yesterday it was at -96?!\n\nhttps://imgur.com/hETAA6W", "created_utc": 1576764105, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ectkoi/iron_condor_on_fdx_what_could_i_have_done_better/", "is_self": true}
