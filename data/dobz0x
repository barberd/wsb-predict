Still scared of trade turnaround and fed though.\n\nWhat do you guys think about msft? I have 35 145calls for nov15 at about 1.75 price point. Been averaging down today. I want to sell today if possible for decent profit. Thinking it'll have a pop to mid 144s sometime today. Would be enough to maybe make 2 or 3k.
