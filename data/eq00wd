{"id": "eq00wd", "title": "After $9 Billion Loss, Trader Revives Career", "selftext": "RUMSON, N.J.\u2014 Howard \"Howie\" Hubler is slowly resurrecting his career after being blamed for a $9 billion trading loss at Morgan Stanley MS 6.61% in 2007 that helped veer the securities firm near collapse when the financial crisis exploded a year later .\n\n\n===== =======\n\n\nThe former mortgage trader now works at a start-up he launched that offers what it says is a cure for the runaway epidemic of homeowners who owe more than their houses are worth.\n\nWorking from a renovated brick church here, the 40-year-old Mr. Hubler and other executives at Loan Value Group LLC have met with dozens of government officials, banks and investors about the firm's \"Responsible Homeowner Reward.\" Underwater borrowers are promised a cash reward if they keep making their mortgage payments, and the closely held firm collects fees from lenders that sign up for the service.\n\n\"We have a view that, this time, we can help,\" says Mr. Hubler, Loan Value Group's chief executive, in his first interview since leaving Morgan Stanley for his disastrous bet on triple-A securities tied to subprime mortgages. Launched in 2008 with a former Morgan Stanley colleague, Loan Value Group has commitments from participating mortgage investors to offer rewards on more than $1 billion in loans.\n\nThe company signed up its first three clients\u2014all hedge funds that own loans\u2014earlier this year. Ohio's Housing Finance Agency has endorsed the program in a recent paper. Mr. Hubler and his colleagues also have met or talked with mortgage-bond pioneer Lewis Ranieri and officials from Citigroup Inc. C -0.30% and Fannie Mae. One thing rarely comes up: Mr. Hubler's past, according to people who have attended the meetings.\n\nAsked about the trading loss in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Hubler replied: \"I'd rather focus on Loan Value Group.\" Frank Pallotta, executive vice president at Loan Value Group, says no one has decided against doing business with the company because of the trading losses.\n\n\"We're comfortable with whatever anybody is able to find out,\" Mr. Pallotta says.\n\nThe $9 billion trading loss is one of the biggest in Wall Street history, exceeding the blowups that destroyed hedge funds Long-Term Capital Management in 1998 and Amaranth Advisors in 2006. Mr. Hubler's trades led to the ouster of several senior officials including Co-President Zoe Cruz, one of the earliest high-profile casualties of the financial crisis.\n\nJohn J. Mack, chief executive of Morgan Stanley at the time, offered to resign over the trading loss, but the board decided to keep him, according to people familiar with the matter. The trading desks at Morgan Stanley where hotshots like Mr. Hubler doubled down their bets with the company's capital have been all but shut down.\n\nBut several mortgage-industry executives who have met with Mr. Hubler about doing business with his new firm say the exit from Morgan Stanley isn't that important. One investor currently using the product says he wasn't concerned because no one suggested that Mr. Hubler acted dishonestly. The loss \"wasn't germane to what we were doing here,\" he says.\n\nThere is no reason to punish the upstart company because of what happened at Morgan Stanley, says a person who met with Mr. Hubler recently. \"If you bring that up in the mortgage industry, it's a slippery slope. \u2026A lot of people drank the Kool-Aid\" and made bad mortgage trades.\n\nMr. Hubler's past has become much more widely known since the mortgage trade was detailed in a chapter of former Wall Street trader Michael Lewis's book \"The Big Short,\" published in March. Privately, Mr. Hubler has told people that his bosses were aware of what he was doing and that few saw the housing debacle coming.\nZoe Cruz\n\n\"His attitude has been that it was a 100-year flood,\" a former coworker says. \"What was he going to do?\"\n\nOthers who worked alongside Mr. Hubler at Morgan Stanley say he owes the company an apology. After he was forced out, executives considered trying to seize some of his compensation, including $25 million made before the trading blowup. Some company executives refused to even mention Mr. Hubler by name.\n\nEventually, though, some of the same Morgan Stanley officials said the loss was a blessing in disguise because it exposed flaws in the firm's risk management. It also convinced Morgan Stanley to tighten its controls and raise capital before the financial crisis deepened two years ago. That forced the company to take emergency capital infusions in order to survive.\n\nTraders who keep in touch with Mr. Hubler say he hasn't changed much since the crisis. At Morgan Stanley, he took a ferry to the firm's Times Square headquarters, where employees on his trading desk once endured a slow period by wagering on the number of chicken nuggets a junior-level trader could eat in one hour.\n\nMr. Hubler now drives a few minutes each morning to Loan Value Group's headquarters. A quote in his office from hockey player Wayne Gretzky reminds employees: \"100% of the shots you don't take don't go in.\" On weekends, the former trader shuttles his kids to football and hockey games.\n\nSome details related to the $9 billion trading loss remain in dispute. Mr. Hubler entered the giant trade in late 2006, which helped offset the cost of a bearish housing position he took earlier. As the housing market grew more precarious in 2007, Mr. Hubler looked for ways to get out of the trade, people close to him say. Just a few months earlier, the trader had argued to superiors that losses on subprime loans wouldn't be severe. Now he was changing his mind.\n\nPeople who worked closely with Mr. Hubler also say he was planning to exit part of the bullish position by converting his trading desk into an asset manager where outside investors could take over some of the trades. The plan was scrapped due to legal and logistical concerns, people familiar with the matter say.\n\nBy the summer, a group of Mr. Hubler's bosses took over management of the position. Many of those officials wanted to sell, but some were reluctant to record a loss as Mr. Hubler and others unsuccessfully looked for a good price to sell in the frozen market.\n\n\n===== =======\n\n\nMs. Cruz, the No. 2 at Morgan Stanley, had ordered a reduction in the size of the firm's risk position, but her lieutenants got bogged down in details, people familiar with the matter say. Arguments flared about whether the positions, scattered across various mortgage-collateralized-debt obligations, could be hedged.\n\nBy the autumn of 2007, it was too late. Subprime bonds plummeted. In December, the firm announced a $9.6 billion write-down.\n\nOn his way out the door, Mr. Hubler checked to make sure he would be allowed to keep all the shares previously awarded to him, a person familiar with the matter says. The company felt it had no choice because Mr. Hubler hadn't broken any rules or deceived higher-ups about his strategy.\nJohn Mack\n\nMr. Hubler now is making another housing bet. Even though his new company doesn't make trades, its success hinges on a slow, uneven housing recovery that would prompt more underwater homeowners to walk away from their loans.\n\nMr. Hubler's reward program taps the desire of banks to minimize such \"strategic defaults.\" Borrowers pay nothing to join the program and keep their reward money only if the loan is paid off. \"That's a heck of an incentive,\" says Lewis Niblett, 66, who got a savings account with $9,000 plus $80 a month to keep making payments on the second mortgage on his three-bedroom stucco home in San Jacinto, Calif.\n\nSome critics contend Mr. Hubler is tricking borrowers to hold onto mortgages that they would be financially better off to abandon. Mr. Hubler counters that Loan Value Group is working to \"get equity back to the borrower.\"\n\nCompany officials say they aren't making money off the mortgage mess because they only turn a profit if lenders recover their money and the borrower pays off the loan. Mr. Hubler says he is \"comfortably confident\" that the product is working as designed \"and it becomes a matter of acceptance in time.\"", "created_utc": 1579265799, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eq00wd/after_9_billion_loss_trader_revives_career/", "is_self": true}
