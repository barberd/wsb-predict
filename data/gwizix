{"id": "gwizix", "title": "Your tendies at $WORK", "selftext": "TL;DR - $WORK is not fully priced in; there is still time to jump in for earnings. 7/17 55c & 8/21 44c\n\nUnless you've been living under the bed your girlfriends boyfriend bangs her on, you know that there's a pandemic on and a lot of need for remote working. Putting aside the actual issues and benefits of it, most of companies that have provided these services have been posting some pretty impressive earnings reports and guidance. $ZM in particular, as you know, has posted very impressive gains this past week, but the cloud and virtual workspace companies in general have done pretty damn great. But we're nearing the end of earnings and there isn't all that much left, but there is something for today, and that's $WORK.\n\nSlack ($WORK) is a subscription-based distributor of virtual workspace technology. There are groups, rooms, support for 3rd party apps so you can send shit back and forth between colleagues, etc. Obviously they're set to do pretty great right? And if it's been on your radar recently, you'll know that it's up pretty significantly even since last week. In fact, today it reached the highest its been since IPO; and it's set to keep going up. >But wait, you say, ain't it priced in? And for the more intelligent among you, you might point out that $MSFT offers basically the same thing through Microsoft Teams, which unlike $WORK's product comes free for businesses which also have a deal with Microsoft. So why, you may ask, would any business shell out for what they already get for free? Doesn't that hurt $WORK both for earnings and for future guidance?\n\nHere's the thing though. Teams is like using hand cream and your hand to crank it; Slack is like Astroglide and a top-tier pocket pussy to do the same. One gets the job done, and one gets the job better and makes you cum. I want you guys to cum with me. You get what you pay for in the virtual workspace market, and Slack has the name recognition and quality to be something companies are willing to pay a subscription for. It's just better overall. Of course what's one autist's take on it, when you could ask what the top dogs are doing. IBM is rolling this shit out to it's entire 350k member workforce; IBM isn't some millennial orgy startup, it's a real company with real weight. There's also some behind the scene \u201crumors\u201d that Amazon is gonna be adopting it the coming months for a large section of their operations. YES AMAZON. ONCE THAT NEWS BREAKS IT WILL MOOOOON.\u00a0 Ya know, that one. If that isn't a resounding endorsement of Slack's quality, idk what you're waiting for, because God himself isn't about to come down telling you Heaven's adopting Slack anytime soon.\n\nWe can see that the stock price is way above the VWAP line indicating a bullish run coming. Further more using the different SMAS I have implemented in my studies it has auto made the upward trend to create those purple lines all pointing upwards. Furthermore we can see it broke the $40 resistance ah and can see the continuation during premarket . Also we can see that the rsi is rising above the 60 line indicating a bullish run as well. The run it has had has no gaps below to fill so we will continue to rise and incorporating UOA showing big money is predicting a big rise after earnings as well. If any of you fucking idiots don\u2019t know TA then it means stonk go up dumbasses.\n\nI think it's pretty clear that $WORK has some mid-term growth in it, and if you're expecting Wave 2: Electric Boogaloo that's even more assured. I'm pretty bullish, so I've grabbed 7/17 55c. It's pretty far OTM, I know, but they're cheap and with what I'm expecting on earnings, they're gonna blow past some of the deep algorithmic TA that I've been seeing putting WORK at $42 a share, and I think it's going to stay up there and keep going. So why bother with the IV crush of short-dated options? Slack's becoming to the virtual office game what Zoom is to the video-conferencing game, and I fully expect AH is gonna be like watching the 1969 moon mission from a front-row seat.\nIBM - \u00a0https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/slack-stock-price-ibm-biggest-account-global-employees-messaging-platform-2020-2-1028890304\n\nMy stake -\u00a0https://imgur.com/a/LtfjJnz\n\nFurther reinforcement its compatible with AMZN -\u00a0https://imgur.com/a/QdHbxs5\n\nTA -\u00a0https://imgur.com/a/eREtF4V\n\nDisclaimer: None of the above is financial advice.
