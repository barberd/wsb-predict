My first strike is $95, conveniently where after hours trading stopped today.  All my contracts expireie at close tomorrow, so Im on the fence between a weekend in Vegas doing lines off a strippers ass, or telling my pregnant wife that I have decided to become a stay at home dad to raise her and her boyfriend's baby.  \n\nSo, I wouldn't say I'm rooting for corona virus, but I wouldn't mind if they held off on the cure till after close tomorrow. Sorry gram and gramps, I know this could kill you and some of your boomer friends, but I'm willing to risk your life and the lives of others in the pursuit of tendies for drugs, prostitutes and a small to medium sized yacht. \n\nPOSITIONS: [https://imgur.com/axV9Oll](https://imgur.com/axV9Oll)", "created_utc": 1582865474, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fapdq5/bynd_meat_yolo_short_positions_linked/", "is_self": true}
