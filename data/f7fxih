I'm trying to help you. \n https://finance.yahoo.com/news/etsy-etsy-report-q4-earnings-151003968.html\n\nThis company has had a good earnings report consistently for the last four quarters, and everyone also knows that this Q4 will be their biggest yet. As their mobile app has improved, coupled with consumers shopping more and more online, I see this as a strong candidate for maximum tendies. \n\nThey've had consistently positive EPS reports, Becky's love this shit and even dude Becky's buy on here all the time. Even my mom, who has no clue how Facebook works at all, is thinking about getting into selling on Etsy. \n\n\"Additionally, the company\u2019s improving mobile app is expected to have aided it in gaining traction across customers in the fourth quarter.\" \n\nThey've recently been looking to hire as well as hiring new engineers, which means they're looking to grow larger to meet the demand for a high quality online craft goods store.  \n\nZacks ranks this in the buy category, but I believe it to be a strong buy given the potential for expansion, increased customer conversion rates, and superior sales techniques being implemented online and on their mobile platform. \n\nTLDR: 3/20 CALL 60 Strike", "created_utc": 1582312141, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7fxih/etsy_to_the_moon/", "is_self": true}
