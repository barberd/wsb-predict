There are two big reasons why SPY might go back down to 157, So lets get started.\n\n1. Both the recessions that took place in 2000 (dot com) and 2008 (housing) crisis have something in common. They both started to decline after hitting 157.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[A graph showing SPY from 1999 to 2015. Notice that in both recessions market hit 157.](https://preview.redd.it/x4fszvffj2l41.png?width=1426&format=png&auto=webp&s=5776be601168dc40d879f067da104110220b7639)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Another chart of SPY showing a more zoomed out view.

In both the 2000 and 2008 recessions, the market declined by approximately 50% and 54% respectively from its peak. Well, guess what is 50%-54% of the current high? Yes, its the region around 157\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Monthly Chart showing SPY, and how the 50-54&#37; moves line up with 157 area](https://preview.redd.it/4lrv005cm2l41.png?width=1163&format=png&auto=webp&s=4869aee346b3a7b39c2a5f077724a48cda30fa5d)\n\nNow, how likely is this situation? Nothing is confirmed until SPY makes a close below this 11 year trend line its been following.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Overall look of Monthly SPY chart.](https://preview.redd.it/i85f1fyon2l41.png?width=1397&format=png&auto=webp&s=68f569274dd3b47bf6e5ef0469e3089ca4f9020b)\n\nAt the time of writing, this would be if SPY CLOSES below 270 this month.\n\nI'm not claiming this will happen, just trying to show you what a recession could look like. All the people saying \"sToNks oN sAle, BuY bUY bUy\", realize that the stock market can go down even more. I'm not against dollar cost averaging your way down, but trying to show you that it might take a couple years to get back where were are right now.", "created_utc": 1583509350.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fef88t/the_case_for_spy_157/", "is_self": true}
