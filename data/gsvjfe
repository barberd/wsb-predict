{"id": "gsvjfe", "title": "Calling Smith & Wesson: $AOBC ticker split to $AOBC and $SWBI", "selftext": "Monday AOBC is splitting to APBC and SWBI tickers, with AOBC raking the outdoor goods and SWBI taking the firearms. Low volume but from a practical standpoint I think people will do basic uncertainty+civil unrest+election and a ticker with a firearm co name in the stock is a recipe for success. \n\nI am hoping to take positions in SWBI after the split, not sure how options care going to work. AOBC has had a huge runoff. Any ideas for someone looking to take a long position familiar with how these spinoffs typically go? I believe that people will see the ticker price drop due to the separation of the value between the brands and buy at a discount running price up.", "created_utc": 1590767802.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gsvjfe/calling_smith_wesson_aobc_ticker_split_to_aobc/", "is_self": true}
