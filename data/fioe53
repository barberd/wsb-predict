{"id": "fioe53", "title": "Zillow - DD", "selftext": "There are a lot of posts about shorting Zillow, the consensus is that they\u2019ll fall if the housing market falls.\n\nI\u2019m aware of some things they are doing from an operations standpoint that aren\u2019t commonly included in the other Zillow posts. They receive a significant amount of revenue from selling mortgage and real estate professionals leads generated through their website. As a mortgage professional, I partner with a realtor and we have a monthly contract that pays Zillow $2250 (1/3 from me 2/3 from the realtor). \n\nThey just opened a mortgage arm of the company and they are working on making it so you can buy homes without a realtor through their platform. So, they are pissing off people like me who have helped them grow to this point. We\u2019re ending our contract at the end of its 1 year term. Most other realtors and lenders I\u2019ve talked to about this are pissed and doing the same.\n\nThey\u2019re getting into mortgage lending at a very difficult time in the industry and I 100% guarantee they fuck it up, while also turning off their main revenue source. \n\nAnyway, fuck Zillow. I have 8/21 30p personally, but really any puts are worthwhile a couple months out or later.\n\nPositions for fucks https://imgur.com/a/1P9r5OE", "created_utc": 1584215664.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fioe53/zillow_dd/", "is_self": true}
