This quarter\u2019s earnings report doesn\u2019t even include all the recent sales they\u2019ve had. People are all aboard the \u201cveganism\u201d train and will be for the next couple minutes while they try their products out a few times.\n\nI expect the stock to run up into next earnings (which will also beat). This is why guidance is good.\n\nOnce people realize they want real steak vs fake steak (the vegans will roast me on this comment) sales will start to slow down/growth will slow.\n\nLong-term, here are my key arguments for why their current market cap isn\u2019t sustainable.\n\n1. Competitors will be wanting in on this gravy train and begin to enter the market. Profits will soon be paper thin just like any other company in the packaged food industry.\n\n2. I don\u2019t see people continuing this trend for the foreseeable future. They tried it and they may or may not like the product, so they\u2019ll try it a few more times, but then it will get old. \n\n3. A 7B+ valuation off 40m revs (net loss of 1-2m) is absolutely absurd.\n\nIm not saying it\u2019s a bad company, but it\u2019s current valuation is absolutely crazy. I even expect it to keep running up until after next earnings... but long term it won\u2019t be able to sustain its current value.\n\nWith the same valuation AAPL would be a gazillion dollar company. Do you want to go long fake meat or overpriced computer stands. The choice is yours.\n\nDisclaimer: I don\u2019t currently have any positions open, but I will most likely buy puts when it gets closer to the next ER.\n\nBefore people decide to roast, this is a forum, let\u2019s have some constructive discussion about this if you feel differently. \n\nLet\u2019s goooooo", "created_utc": 1559858931, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bxmq2c/a_continuation_of_my_bynd_due_diligence/", "is_self": true}
