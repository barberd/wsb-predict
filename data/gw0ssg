AVCTX Warrants are currently less than $0.10. 1st earnings in 10 days.", "selftext": "##AVCT\n\nThis is a neat one, very excited to find this and post about it here.\n\nThere's very little discussion out there on AVCT.  They've never been mentioned on /r/SPACs before today.  They've flown completely under the radar as far as I can tell.  It seems like the stock IPO sort of tanked because the Holding company went to market without the merger being completely finished.  They rebranded to AVCT, but they didn't really have a core product ready yet.  People seem to have assumed the stock was vaporware and sold off.  They had a couple quarters of 0 revenue, stock tanked, since then everyone seems to have forgotten about them, even though it has only been 4 months.\n\nBut, then they merged with Computex, which is their core product --  Computex is now being renamed to AVCT.  So, Computex is the company to read up on if you want to know what AVCT is worth.  From what I can tell, Computex seems... totally legit.\n\nThey are actively posting jobs:\n\nhttps://computex.net/careers/\n\n>US-TX-Houston\n\n>Posted Date 2 days ago(6/1/2020 8:20 AM)\n\n>**Job Title Principal Engineer, Infrastructure Services (Microsoft Technologies)**\n\n>An established 30+ year-old yet growing $150M+ technology company, with 200 employees in multiple states, is seeking a senior level Data Center Engineer in our Network Operations Center (NOC) in Houston, TX. This is a Tier 3 level resource with specialized knowledge and experience in Microsoft Technologies, Azure, Office 365, Messaging Technologies, Virtualization and Core Infrastructure Services. This position will work closely with our Principal Engineers and Infrastructure Team to maintain, update and introduce new functionality to the existing environment. This person will also assist in supporting the Windows server environment and other server/storage infrastructure projects will be assigned as needed.   At Computex, our Guiding Principles are simple, but critical to maintaining our incredible culture and our daily endeavor for excellence in everything we do. o Delight our Customers o Develop a Fun & Creative Workplace o Provide Value to our Shareholders   The ideal candidate also believes in these core guiding principles and mission.\n\n>Job ID 2020-1072\n\nI work in IT, and everything in the job posting is perfectly valid.  Computex seems to be a nice, $150M+ business with like 200 employees.\n\nThey have employees listed on LinkedIn, around 190 profiles, which aligns with all of their claims in the job post.  The employee profiles are solid and they have real experience.\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/jon-burbach-14ba923/ - Worked for IBM for 11 years..\n\nExecutive team seems solid.  Their first earnings are about to come out on 6/14.\n\nIt's a real cloud company, by all indications around 80% undervalued, **for $0.09 a warrant.**\n\nThe ONLY way a SPAC should ever trade this low is if it's some sort of scam / malfeasance / etc. -- that doesn't seem to be the case here. There is every indication that this stock will return to $10 fairly quickly after a couple quarters of earnings, and that warrants will return to around $1.\n\n## Built-in 5-10 bagger on Warrants.", "created_utc": 1591212675.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gw0ssg/dd_avct_a_10_wfh_computing_spac_on_sale_for_2/", "is_self": true}
