{"id": "f06nee", "title": "Regarding u/WSBgod's proof", "selftext": "Alright so here\u2019s a brief rundown while I wait to hear back from u/WSBgod for permission to post more details.  For now, this is what I\u2019m sharing.  \n\nLet me start by saying that during the mania today, my position was that the whole thing was a hoax.  Many comments were focusing on how options prices were nicely rounded 100.00 and shit like that.  While I didn\u2019t have time to really dive into those details, I was skeptical simply because he claimed to go from $4 million to $8 million.  Nicely doubling your bet is not something you typically do with options, that\u2019s what you do with roulette when betting on black.  It was just too clean.  Of course, it was also very lucky and extremely ballsy\u2014neither of which is uncommon on WSB.\n\nNevertheless, [I took the post down](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f006zu/wsbgod_post_removed_pending_indisputable_proof/) until there was indisputable proof.  Behind the scenes, this was roughly the exchange in modmail with timestamps.\n\n***\n\nHere's the timeline (all in central time)\n\n&gt;1:55pm u/ITradeBaconFutures stickies a comment on mega thread saying [\"Proof or ban\"](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ezwbve/reports_of_my_death_have_been_greatly_exaggerated/fgq6q81/)\n\n&gt;3:32pm u/WSBgod messages mods and asks \"What do you recommend?\"\n\n&gt;3:34pm I reply \"idk but it better be good. I'm recommending a screen sharing session\"\n\n&gt;4:28pm u/WSBgod replies \"I'm happy to verify, have nothing to hide and my post history is the best evidence a person could ask for. But I won't do anything that reveals personal information, login credentials, or anything that could be used against me.\"\n\n&gt;4:53pm \"This should be all the evidence you need:\n\n&gt;&lt;link to imgur with his account summary&gt;\n\n&gt;PLEASE do not share this or pass it around and make me regret doing your verification. I know you need to verify to keep BSers off here, but please keep my privacy in mind. Thank you.\"\n\nThe picture was a screenshot of his account summary from his broker with many trades, including tesla\n\n&gt;4:55pm \"Not good enough sorry.\"\n\nThen there was bickering back and forth about what standard of proof meant, and what we could do about it until u/WSBgod capitulated.\n\nAt 5:18pm He accepted the screenshare which we did shortly after.\n\n***\n\nWe went on discord and he shared his screen, where he had a chrome window up with a couple of tabs open to vanguard, one of which was logged in and had a clearly visible **SSL** icon to the left of the address.  He scrolled around (without hitting the top of the screen where his name/account would show).  Once he was done showing me the numbers, I asked him to refresh the page.  He then took the discord window and carefully placed it such that it covered only the contents of the website to hide his name from showing up after the refresh.   The \u201cdiscord censor window\u201d was small enough so that I could see the address bar at all times, and most of the contents of the webpage.  There was no keyboard shortcuts\u2014everything was done by mouse.  He clicked the refresh button, and after a visible refresh of the site, he moved the \u201cdiscord censor window\u201d and showed me that all the numbers remained the same.\n\n***\n\nI\u2019ve taken the video and edited it such that it removes all personal information, but I can\u2019t in good conscience publish it without his consent.  Doing so would eliminate the possibility of anybody ever trusting me (or the mods) with any sort of proof again, and for that reason I will wait and hope to get permission to post it.  Otherwise this is the extent of what I\u2019m sharing.\n\nSo the question remains, could this be fake? Absofuckinglutely.  Could he fake the url, website, broker summary, ssl certificates and inspect/refresh? Yes.  Of course it can be faked.  For all the retard talk that\u2019s thrown around, you all are actually really fucking capable (you\u2019ve proved it time and time again).  I\u2019m not saying that u/WSBgod\u2019s claims are irrefutable, I\u2019m just laying out the proof he gave me.\n\nWhen people make huge ass claims, as mods, the best we can do is ask for \u201cproof.\u201d  Short of asking for his username and password, this was the closest thing that I could think of and I gave him a very short window of time.  Never in the history of WSB have I ever asked to log into somebody\u2019s computer to see their screen. There\u2019s no precedent for that and there\u2019s no reason for him to have anticipated that.  u/fscomeau faked a video but he filmed, edited it on his own time and uploaded it to youtube.  In today\u2019s case, I gave u/WSBgod less than 2 hours to let me on his computer and he did exactly what I asked him to do once I was watching his screen.  As a mod, that is as much proof as I can reasonably ask somebody to give me.  And as a mod, I'm sharing it with you.  If there\u2019s a better method of proof, I\u2019m open to ideas.  If he faked it, then congrats to him for doing a good job at faking and anticipating my response when asking for proof.  And if he made money then congrats to him for scoring big.\n\nThe last note I\u2019ll share is his account balance **did not show $8 million dollars**.  The total balance was slightly less, but it was pretty damn close.  \n\nI\u2019ll let you decide for yourselves based on this information and I hope to be able to post the video soon.", "created_utc": 1581057278, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f06nee/regarding_uwsbgods_proof/", "is_self": true}
