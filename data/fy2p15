{"id": "fy2p15", "title": "Please learn from my mistakes", "selftext": "For years, I felt like multiples had gotten out of control and the fact that billionaires ran companies that lost billions made no fundamental sense. I felt the debt bubble growing and didn't understand how it was allowed to keep going.\n\nIn mid-February I started taking the Coronavirus very seriously. I saw what was happening around the world and figured the US would deal with it poorly. This would lead to a delayed shut down which would freak people out and drive market volatility. So I sold my long positions in Target, Nike, and Campbell's (worth about $65k) and decided to gamble with it.\n\nWithin the first two weeks, I grew $65k to nearly $350k with shorts on companies like Starbucks, Uber, Lyft, AAL, and LYV, and VIX calls at various levels. I started to feel like it was too easy, like I had discovered some sort of cheat code. I started to sell some positions and cashed out $170k, but I kept $200k in play (a mix of cash and margin positions). I figured if the Fed made a few moves I could afford to lose $30k of current positions and still maintain the $170k gain. Edit: When I say \"cashed $170k\" I mean those were realized gains. They were not taken out of my account. I still had more in play than the realized gains.\n\nI got ahead of myself. I fell victim to greed that is capable of gripping any of us, bulls or bears. I got borderline arrogant and went in way too heavy. I still believe in my fundamental read of the market, but I now look back at $20k positions with July dates that were up 100% and wonder why I didn't sell. It's important to realize when you've hit a truly unique period (March) and when you need to watch out for what's next.\n\nI think we will still see another crash, but the fed is actively postponing and softening it. I am shifting to more cash, though I am also holding June, July, September, and October puts. I will look to sell them at profit when I can, and go cash until I get a better handle on what may happen next.\n\nLink to my account rise and fall: https://imgur.com/a/kTAYgZi\n\nTLDR: Nothing ever goes up forever, nothing ever goes down forever. You never know what may happen or what moves someone will make. Be extra greedy during very small windows and extra cautious even when your read still appears to be playing out.", "created_utc": 1586473390.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fy2p15/please_learn_from_my_mistakes/", "is_self": true}
