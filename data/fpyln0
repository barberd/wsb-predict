We\u2019ve all heard about the ABN Amro 200 mil loss thanks to one autist who couldn\u2019t pay his losses. Enter 1 million autists. We all put everything we have in the ABN bank then short their stock as much as physically possible. Synthetic short, selling naked calls, or just plain puts. If it tanks, we make infinite tendies. If stonk goes up and we lose everything, none of us will be able to pay the margin calls ergo the bank incurs more losses, stonk goes way down, and we make our tendies back. THE MORE MONEY WE LOSE THE MORE MONEY WE MAKE. THIS CANNOT GO TITS UP\n\nTLDR: stonk goes down = tendies, stonk goes up = tendies", "created_utc": 1585322033.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpyln0/unlimited_guaranteed_money/", "is_self": true}
