Well I'm here to give you some good news like a hot blast from my wife's boyfriend to her face: new estimates have airlines losing 63 to 113 BILLION WITH A B dollars in revenue this year. That's 11-19% of their annual revenue\n\n[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/airlines-could-lose-up-to-%24113-bln-in-passenger-revenue-due-to-coronavirus-iata-says-2020](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/airlines-could-lose-up-to-%24113-bln-in-passenger-revenue-due-to-coronavirus-iata-says-2020)\n\nImagine thinking this shit is already priced in!!!! For the shittier airlines like AAL who already had negative free cash flow and massive debts and negative share holder equity, this means they will GET FUCKED. The only risk factor I believe is Trump coming in and bailing their ass out, but that shouldn't happen until their stock drops faster to their knees than your mom after a few drinks at the sailor convention.\n\nSo for all you airline put holders, ESPECIALLY AAL, be \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c, because there's going to be a lot more pain.\n\nPremarket agrees with me, as it's already down 4+ precent.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hvojcfx46uk41.png?width=1318&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f7b439a0f990b430d68847e323f2588dcb0a932\n\nPositions for funsies:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4s520g486uk41.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=6149ca96fdfad592502029ebf651f2ad737e3e5f\n\nTLDR: Strong \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c on airline puts.", "created_utc": 1583406287.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fdtoef/airlines_to_face_up_to_113_billion_revenue_hit/", "is_self": true}
