I calculated it, and if the market falls by 1%, that would make SPY at 306.55, which would make the 308 puts worth 1.45 each and the 309 puts worth 2.45 each. \n\nAfter visualizing this in my head, I sold my last shares to buy 5000 worth of puts expiring Tomorrow and Monday. (because having thought about it, I would regret not doing it if I see the market go down tomorrow. I don't agree with the other post, I think the market will go down because it's a Friday)\n\nI'm now really regretting buying these because I was feeling really regretful over the walmart thing (not selling yesterday, sleeping too long) and was super tired when this happened. I pray the gods will favor me and make the SPY go down so that I can reduce my total losses to SPY puts.", "created_utc": 1573776589, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dwieuq/spy_fd_put_yolo/", "is_self": true}
