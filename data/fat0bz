Soon we saw splenda gone, now its equal.  Okay.  Go to local coffee shop that always has splenda and they also used Equal (not splenda, even though I ask for splenda bc it doesnt taste like shit).  Went to the store to get some splenda, fuckin shelf is empty.  Now I'm seeing Equal disappear off the shelves.. probably bc theres no splenda... HOW CAN WE USE THIS INFORMATION SO I CAN IMPORT SPLENDA?   shits been MIA for a few months now.\n\nbelow are the artificial sweetener companies, (or companies that are involved)  can one of you deep pocket trust fund babies log into your bloomberg terminal and tell me where all the splenda is? And why equal is also disappearing...  oh, dont forget how I can make tendies off this autistic shit, bc I'm broke.  \n\nP.s.  sweet n low taste like shit.\n\n\nCargill\nIngredion\nArcher Daniels Midland Company\nTate and Lyle. &lt;---- SPLENDA COMPANY\nAjinomoto Co., Inc.\nCelanese Corporation", "created_utc": 1582887225, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fat0bz/wheres_all_the_good_fake_sugar/", "is_self": true}
