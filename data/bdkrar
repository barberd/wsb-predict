{"id": "bdkrar", "title": "PLNT is an overvalued piece of shit stock", "selftext": "It has a net income of like $30m/quarter and is valued at almost $6B. It's trading at a PE of over 70 and it's a fucking gym chain. Even if it tripled its EPS it would still be overvalued. Its share price has wildly outpaced its net income in growth over the past year. It has a franchising model so none (maybe some idk) of its gyms it even owns. And there's only so much of a market for large shitty gyms in the US; it's probably approaching saturation already considering the low hanging fruit is already snatched up.\n\nI'm going all in on puts on this piece of shit.", "created_utc": 1555358743, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bdkrar/plnt_is_an_overvalued_piece_of_shit_stock/", "is_self": true}
