My first goal is to turn that into $10,000 as soon as possible.\n\nThe only problem is, I don\u2019t know how the f-f-f-f-f-fuck I\u2019m supposed to do that. If anyone has some ideas on how on earth I can possibly turn $750 into $10,000 that would be utterly fantastic. Thanks broskis.\n\nP.S. this is not a shitpost. I\u2019m genuinely eager to absorb any knowledge I can get from you intelligent human beings. I look forward to your suggestions on how to smash my goal!\n\nP.P.S. sorry for the long post.", "created_utc": 1582703645, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9pvzl/serious_how_to_turn_750_into_10000_fast/", "is_self": true}
