The rest I trade a little with and the first 10% is either cash or options. I like to sell covered calls on a few specific stocks, and I need to be able to trade from my phone but would love a decent web layout as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGot just under 20k in my account. And if they can transfer out of RH for free, even better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat's a decent brokerage? I might switch all my stocks to Chase and keep the RH options game going but I don't really know what else is out there.", "created_utc": 1559061435, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bu276g/quitting_robinhood_whats_a_better_freecheap/", "is_self": true}
