Tight, me too. \n\nDon\u2019t be a sheep and buy visa calls with the increased IV, buy MA calls for lower IV but nearly identical underlying movement. \n\nVisa will have to report dreadful numbers to drop below what they already did this week, so I think it\u2019s a decent risk/reward play. \n\nAlso sell TSLA $300 calls IV is insane. \n\nYou\u2019re welcome!", "created_utc": 1571852775, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dm2ucf/visa_er_smart_play/", "is_self": true}
