Thanks for telling me about options. \n\nBut .. yesterday I've opened following bull put spread\n\n1 AMZN 202001'31 PUT 1825\n\n\\-1 AMZN 202001'31 PUT 1850\n\nI sold the 1850, bought the 1825 - so if the AMZN is above 1850, I shouldn't GUH.\n\nI don't remember the actual numbers, I think it was something like 1000$ max profit and 2000$ max lost, dunno, can't read.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the thing - after purchase, the entire combo was -10$. \n\nRight now it's +975.59$ - awesome, now I don't wanna risk this hooker money, I wanna close the position and take my 975$. But if I try to do that, IB tells me this\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**AMAZON.COM INC** (AMZN)\n\nYou will pay **1,355 USD**\n\n**WE ARE SELLING** **1 AMZN 202001'31 PUT 1825**\n\n**WE ARE BUYING** **1 AMZN 202001'31 PUT 1850**\n\n**Estimated costs:** Commission USD 8.00 (-0.59%)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuestion - the f\\* is wit the 1,355 USD that I should pay? Do I actually pay it, so I actually loose money on this combo? Or is that something that broker deals with and I just keep the 975$? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL/DR: can I close it, or do I have to let it expire?\n\nTx!", "created_utc": 1580468291, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ewmtbt/first_time_options_stupid_question_about_my_amzn/", "is_self": true}
