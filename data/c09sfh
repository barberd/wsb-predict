{"id": "c09sfh", "title": "JPM Set To Breakout", "selftext": "JPM is set to breakout, as early as tomorrow, in anticipation of rate cuts\n Its high is around 117. It has tested 112 in the last week a couple times. It currently resides around 109. I am guestimating it at least hits 110 tomorrow, or higher. \n\nCalls for tomorrow are cheap at about .20 for 110 strike. A small move will more than double your money. A significat move to retest 112 and it'll be like 5x. Get your calls now. Just bought 10k worth myself at .21.", "created_utc": 1560452034, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c09sfh/jpm_set_to_breakout/", "is_self": true}
