Bc in my head this should be a great idea but surely someone's tried it. Here it is:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPick a volatile stonk. Every day it's all over the place. Kind you're pretty sure is getting P&D'd but yr wife's boyfriend seems to believe in and who are you to disagree with daddy? All you know for sure is that it goes up and it goes down, every day all day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, we buy a call on said stonk, doesn't matter the details bc this is r/wallstreetbets YOLO. But we ALSO buy a put at the SAME strike for the SAME expiration. Now our trap is set!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll we have to do now is wait! The stonk goes up (as we knew it would). Perfect! Sell the call. And we wait, once again. As always happens, stonk goes down (wife's bf is NOT gonna b happy about this). We sell the put.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn b4 this is hedging and not a troo YOLO worthy of this fine subreddit... No my friends, it definitely is not a hedge. We made money both ways. Esp in today's market where we trade sideways for days, how would this NOT make $$$??\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Apparently this is called a [Straddle](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/straddle.asp)\\-- I'm thinking if we go negative interest rates and wind up like Japan for the next decade could this be the only way to play the stonks?", "created_utc": 1589582682.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gkj94r/an_idea_that_literally_cant_go_tits_up_what_am_i/", "is_self": true}
