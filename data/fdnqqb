So when it hit like 308, I bought and told myself that I shouldn't have to worry if sentiment starts to get bullish. To the contrary I said, SPY probably won't get rekt until everyone deeply believes that stonks will do their thing.   \nWith FED always pushing 10min before EOD and boomers too stupid to manage their money I now sense a very bullish sentiment and I can feel God trying peel off my gayness. In the books this should be great, because in my logic markets will die soon.
