{"id": "gncimb", "title": "Will Take-Two Interactive|$TTWO (Ripper, GTA, NBA 2K) follow Activision and rise after earnings, or will it drop like a tank in the ocean?", "selftext": "Take Two $TTWO is in a very interesting position and so are last second investors that haven't jumped in yet, ahead of todays after-close 4:30pm earnings call.\n\nTake Two is a very strange and inconsistent stock. The assumption is that due to covid, and new user numbers help this, that Take Two's 4Q results will blow it out the park, have \"holiday numbers\" they say, and it will skyrocket the stock price (at least for some days).\n\nThe issue is this is Take-Two, and you can see the early chart movements this morning showing how uncertain people are to just buy and rise the stock into earnings.\n\nTake-Two has a very well-known history of mismanaging money, and while they are MUCH better now than they were years ago it's still a concern. In a years back in the day, when GTAV online was new, NBA and other sports sales doubled, and several original projects took off, many with microtransactions, Take-Two still lost a ton of money and the stock dropped. That's not the first time that happened either.\n\nFast forward to 2020, and people are still skeptical. But I myself have already dropped in because there are two factors that may help people relax about the earnings.\n\nOne is the amount of new users, and thus microtransaction gains have always been double to 4x more than Activisions or EA's the last 3 years **CONSISTENTLY**, and assuming that stays the same as we add in covid shut-ins, this should continue or be even higher. Considering how much Activision smashed this helps make it so that it's very likely TTWO will smash.\n\nThe second is that TTWO always adjusts and cuts down operations for the slow season, which for TTWO is generally Q4. But with the rise in spending, **this means that they are receiving a ton of extra revenue that they were never accounting for that basically adds up to free cash** thanks to the covid/sars 2 pandemic, and considering TTWO is a Worldwide brand with worldwide Ips, that means they got a ton of profits unexpected during the off-season WORLDWIDE.\n\nSo if you wanna bet on a potential winner with a likely HUGE jump in stock price for the next few days I'd jump in within the next hour or so before the premiums shoot up too high. \n\nThough some people believe it will drop like a tank in water, these analysts haven't really given compelling reasons though outside the history I mentioned earlier.", "created_utc": 1589985578.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gncimb/will_taketwo_interactivettwo_ripper_gta_nba_2k/", "is_self": true}
