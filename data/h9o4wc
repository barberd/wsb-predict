{"id": "h9o4wc", "title": "DD: Earnings report tomorrow (Tuesday) after close. Morning Star Report included. Fair value estimate is $48", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nGroupon app has risen in the past 30 days from 68th to 38th app in shopping section of AppStore. They report tomorrow after close so there is time to act. Morning star increased their rating to 5 star buy --> [https://docdro.id/o0evLkz](https://docdro.id/o0evLkz) In this document it shows 4 star but on their site it's updated to 5 star. Also there was unusually high activity bidding the price up today. Seems that professionals are wising up to this trade.\n\nGroupon has bottomed. There was an avalanche of bad news and at this point bad news can't bring down the price any longer. Groupon has a new management and was previously significantly mismanaged. At this point if they hold an orgy with goats their stock won't fall any more. All bad news is priced in IMO. Morning Star thinks their FAIR VALUE is $48\n\nDisclaimer: this are my thought. Do as you please. I'm not your advisor.\n\ntl;dr GRPN JUN 19, 2020 30.00 CALL GRPN#F1920D300000", "created_utc": 1592252725.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h9o4wc/dd_earnings_report_tomorrow_tuesday_after_close/", "is_self": true}
