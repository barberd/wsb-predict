{"id": "bv9qkx", "title": "BYND Easy Money?", "selftext": "I just executed a trade that still has me a bit uneasy - like as if I'm missing something. The name of this strategy is called \"Short Guts\" - [http://www.theoptionsguide.com/short-guts.aspx](http://www.theoptionsguide.com/short-guts.aspx). If I'm understanding my risks correctly, my risks are in the outer quantiles; lower than the short 45C and higher than the long 120P.  \n\nIt's a rather odd strategy, but given a number of factors, I think it may prove quite profitable with BYND at its current valuation. My biggest risk is that I am selling a deep ITM Naked Call. If the stock goes above 120, I'm without insurance. I can easily mitigate this now by buying an OTM Call (e.g. 130C for \\~$7.20). This caps my max-loss and increases my POP to \\~99%.  \n\n\nReasoning behind employing this strategy now:\n\n* BYND's current valuation is highly questionable.\n* The IV is through the roof &gt;100% making this a great candidate to sell. Create alone is over \\~$10k for such a huge spread!\n* Lockup period expires in October making this stock likely to drop considerably by that time.\n* The only logical upside risk at this point is if MCD says they're going to start selling BYND burgers. Hence, I should probably secure those naked calls by buying a OTM call for rather cheap.\n* Additional risk in a likely short squeeze from the point above.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **Am I missing something? Why does this seem like too easy money?**\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/gbloznoamk131.png\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/encrzvvjnk131.png", "created_utc": 1559320355, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bv9qkx/bynd_easy_money/", "is_self": true}
