{"id": "eemnhu", "title": "The Fornite Before Christmas", "selftext": " \n\n'Twas the fortnite before Christmas, when all through the house\n\n Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse (Pelosi);\n\n The chinese stockings were hung by the chimney with care,\n\n In hopes that St. Elon soon would be there;\n\n The children were nestled all snug in their beds;\n\n While visions of Boeing CEO's danced in their heads;\n\n And mamma in her semi-conductors, and I with Lisa Su,\n\n Had just settled our NVDA for a long winter's poo,\n\n When out on the trading floor there arose such a clatter,\n\n I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.\n\n Away to Robinhood's risk management team I flew like a flash,\n\n Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.\n\n The FINRA's fine on the breast of the new-fallen snow,\n\n Gave $1.25M fines of midday to objects below,\n\n When what to my wondering eyes did appear,\n\n But a miniature Chinese made sleigh and eight genetically produced and stolen IP design of tiny rein-deer,\n\n With a Fedex little old driver so lively and quick,\n\n I knew in a moment from the lack of health care, he must be St. Nick.\n\n More rapid than Eagles losing their shot at the Super Bowl again, his coursers they came,\n\n And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name:\n\n \"Now, *Trump!* now, *Mitch!* now *Giuliani**!* and *Zelensky*!\n\n On, *Epstein*! on, *Hillary*! on, *Bill!* and *Andrew*!\n\n To the top of the noose! to the top of the wall! Epstein didn't kill himself after all!\n\n Now dash away! dash away! and go fuck yourself until next fall!", "created_utc": 1577118035, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eemnhu/the_fornite_before_christmas/", "is_self": true}
