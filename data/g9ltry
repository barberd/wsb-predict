HD didn't miss earnings as much as the street was expecting, therefore it will go up.  Just ignore the fact that a large chunk of revenue for HD comes from its financial arm, which has lent out huge amounts of loans to subprime borrowers with credit scores below 640 (i.e. biker gangs) during an economic maelstrom.  Also ignore the fact that a large income stream for HD comes from selling $40,000 heavy bikes that are almost exclusively ridden by geriatric Boomers still pretending like they're Jack Nicholson in Easy Rider - a customer base that's dying off.  $HOG is already up premarket. Should have bought calls.  Bears gonna get reamed today.", "created_utc": 1588074822.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9ltry/hog_harley_davidson_shows_46_decline_in_profits/", "is_self": true}
