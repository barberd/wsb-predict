{"id": "fkaano", "title": "FIVE 3/27 $45p Earnings Play", "selftext": "I am buying 3/27 $45p on FIVE ahead of earnings. For those of you too autistic to understand by the name, Five Below is a store like the dollar tree that sells things for less than $5. Today the stock is mooning for no reason (up like 17% as of posting this). The only news today is some lady named Karen at Barclays restated a HOLD position ( [sauce](https://www.smarteranalyst.com/new-blurbs/five-below-five-receives-a-hold-from-barclays/) ) and these puts are cheapening up unlike every other option in the world (thanks IV).\n\nDue to the nature of selling cheap shit for cheap prices, FIVE has it's entire supply chain in CHINA - aka where beer virus has been halting manufacturing for two months.  ( [S&P source](https://panjiva.com/Manufacturers-Of/Five+Below#) Add to that the US going into basically retail lockdown and FIVE is coming off of no supply and going into having no demand. Their profit margin is something like 9% regularly and they report earnings after close tomorrow. Even if they don't completely shit the bed on earnings the world is going to end soon so these have to print.\n\nThere's like no open interest in these so maybe pick a different strike or expiry, but this is a no brainer\n\nedit: here are my positions, don't judge me for being a broke fuck\nhttps://imgur.com/a/M9b0HfH", "created_utc": 1584469640.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkaano/five_327_45p_earnings_play/", "is_self": true}
