This shit is exploding from a wedge it was building since we started the big bounce. You want DD? This shit doesn't need DD, it's actual fucking gold. You want earnings catalyst? Get a job. You want options? You got um baby. Buy $GLD, buy $GDX, or buy a royalty company $FNV or $SAND, just buy shiny yellow metal. Bad market, good market, inflation, deflation, and masturbation, all better with gold. Yolo this shit. I got some positions 6 months out and some expiring Friday. If we don't crack $1800 spot price by June I'll call Paul Wall and tell him to make me a grill. \n\nPos: $GLD 5/22 165c and $GDX 1/21 $30c", "created_utc": 1589773005.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/glttsu/where_are_all_the_gold_bulls/", "is_self": true}
