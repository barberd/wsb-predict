{"id": "g1zh95", "title": "A little DD from my job in the travel industry", "selftext": "I work in the rental car industry at the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), our location is usually one of top 5 busiest in the US. This month has seen business decimated, we're talking instead of renting 1000-1500 cars on a monday we do less than 50-70. Everyone is either doing mass layoff or shutting down completely. 90% of my coworkers have applied for unemployment. It's not looking to get any better til july/august. You can witness this yourself by just going to any airport and seeing the traffic. Most of this is already priced in but I don't think people realize the severity. Anw, maybe this helps some of you make some money. Good luck.", "created_utc": 1586980748.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1zh95/a_little_dd_from_my_job_in_the_travel_industry/", "is_self": true}
