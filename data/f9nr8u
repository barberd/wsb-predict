Roku has shown some strength while Intel has reached a PE of 12. It either works or it doesn't. After seeing all the gay bears come out of the woodworks predicting a straight line down to -50% spy I decided to inverse WSB and buy the dip. Worst case scenario I use the high IV to sell Roku calls and I still make money, only losing the Intel calls. If everyone could double their money everyday buying spy puts why would anyone still be working? Can't be that easy, just as weak bulls got shaken out, I expect the weak bears to be shaken out on the bounce tomorrow. Volatility Bitches!
