{"id": "gaynrm", "title": "ToS's Risk Profile/Probability Analysis and Earnings", "selftext": "ToS's MMM (market maker move) for AMZN is say +-137. That means that there's a ~70% chance it will stay between current price +-$137 for today. HOWEVER, when I examine an option, in this case an IC, it's saying its expected move is much, MUCH less (i.e. +-$40). Even when I use chance to touch, the numbers do not come close to matching. So is ToS's probability analysis completely pointless when earnings are near?", "created_utc": 1588263208.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gaynrm/toss_risk_profileprobability_analysis_and_earnings/", "is_self": true}
