The initial thought is someone knows something on the institutional side and I am going to cleaned the fuck out. Last few days were pretty bullish as well so I started to get weak hands. I closed out ToS and went back to work. Someone finally links this post, which is so unbelievably dumb it's hilarious. I cannot imagine how deep red that guy is right now.\n\nRetard play - [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gmour6/costco\\_340c\\_er\\_lotto\\_1600\\_contracts/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gmour6/costco_340c_er_lotto_1600_contracts/)\n\nNow on to the next play with Costco. I am going to go long before close today with some bull put spreads and I will most likely buy some OTM calls to take on more risk with the premium received. I may not hold through earnings, but I think I will be good to pocket another 30%.\n\nThe logic for the play is the special dividend and China's second warehouse which is coming down the pipe.\n\nDividend schedule for Costco -\n\n[https://investor.costco.com/stock-information/dividend-history](https://investor.costco.com/stock-information/dividend-history)\n\n12/10/12 - $7.00 per share\n\n2/09/15 - $5.00 per share\n\n5/10/17 - $7.00 per share\n\nIt is my belief that Costco is going to announce a special dividend within the next few days. Their announcements are typically towards the end of the week and are every 3 years. Additionally, it has been public information for a while that a second Costco warehouse is to be released in the 2nd half of the fiscal year. Well it's the second half of the fiscal year now.\n\nThere is no announcement in the states yet, but people realize it is coming pretty soon.\n\nChina side - [http://www.china.org.cn/business/2020-02/20/content\\_75725735.htm](http://www.china.org.cn/business/2020-02/20/content_75725735.htm)\n\nI will probably buy a 305C 5/29 and sell a 285/280P 5/29.\n\nUpdate - I have executed both of those trades and bought shares.", "created_utc": 1590071517.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gnxwge/cost_update_dd_inside_exit_before_earnings_before/", "is_self": true}
