Needing to play catch-up with his retirement portfolio, the piping engineer decided to bet on a complicated product he hoped would deliver double-digit annual returns.\n\n>> It worked so well\u2014earning him 18% a year in dividends, on average\u2014that he eventually poured $800,000 into the investments, called leveraged exchange-traded notes, or ETNs. When the coronavirus pandemic hit, he lost almost every penny.\n\n>> \u201cI\u2019m 67 years old and I\u2019m basically bankrupt in just two weeks,\u201d Mr. Mark said.\n\n> What. No.\n\n>> James Zhu, a 78-year-old retired college professor and engineer, invested his and his wife\u2019s life savings into ETNs based on payment streams from mortgage bonds, bundled together by investment firms and amped up with leverage. \u2026\n\n>> The ETN Mr. Zhu bought from UBS slumped to less than 25 cents a share, from around $14 at the start of the year. Once the value of the ETN fell below $5, UBS had the option to redeem it. It did so on March 17, notifying investors they would be paid out $0.201 per security held. That resulted in a loss of $700,000 for Mr. Zhu, who had purchased the ETN at $13.35.\n\n> \u201cWe\u2019re too old to play those games,\u201d Mr. Zhu said. \u201cIt\u2019s too difficult for us. We were just looking for basic income.\u201d\n\nFun read.
