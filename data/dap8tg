Wag (a dog walking company) got $300m in funding, Wework (a real estate company pretending to be tech) once was valued at $47b, Theranos got $10b without having an actual product etc. I\n\nWhat I'm noticing is that in the world of investment funding the old adage that \"talk is cheap\" isn't true. In fact, talking can get you billions in funding. What all those crappy, scammy, companies above had in common were charismatic CEOs who knew how to grab attention with their words. Adam Neumann was the best of the them. Yesterday I watched an interview he did a few months ago, and despite knowing that Wework is basically a scam and Adam is full of shit, I still felt inspired and moved by the way Adam was explaining things. I almost wanted all the bad stories about him and the company to be lies! I finally understood how he made one of the oldest businesses in world history (landlording) seem like the wave of the future.\n\nI'm starting to think I'm wasting my time investing. I feel like I can do better by taking a public speaking class and starting a tech company. It doesn't matter what the service is, as long as it has an app I can use the talking skills I've learned to get a VC firm or IB to fund me 9 figures. Once the company gets a nice valuation, I'll start acting erratically so that I can get removed as CEO which will then give me an excuse to cash out.\n\nWhat do you think?", "created_utc": 1569722964, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dap8tg/instead_of_wasting_time_investing_i_feel_like_i/", "is_self": true}
