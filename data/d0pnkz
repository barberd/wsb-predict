My plan is to load on puts. Basically,\n\n- They released a press announcement that China tariffs wouldn\u2019t affect them. Well, duh, how would China\u2019s tariffs on physical products affect a virtual platform using virtual money?! I think they are preemptively hiding something.\n\n- Their business model is basically letting people trade commission-free (attracting the poor) but the orders are packaged and routed to HFT firms so that market makers can take full advantages of you. Any platform that takes advantage of poor idiots should not make a lot of money in long term.\n\nThoughts?", "created_utc": 1567819067, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d0pnkz/short_robinhoods_earning_next_week_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
