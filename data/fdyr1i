Source: IHS Markit, but here's another chart since I don't wanna get fucked for giving their stuff out for free). \n\n[\\(Fig 1.\\) China represents almost half global oil demand growth in 2020](https://preview.redd.it/z78btt8ywvk41.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=94543596be780cdddf432775e6e7fd7b53a4feb7)\n\nAlso, the U.S. was in it's first year into being off the QE tiddy milk.  If we look at the relatively flat returns of bingeing Fed teddies since that start of 2015 through the diarrhea at the end of August 2015 (Fig 2.), we can relate a same like-ness to whats transpired over the last 10 days.  The difference is that we've had a huge run up last year with an even greater dependency on Chinese growth than in 2015.\n\n[\\(Fig 2.\\) 2015-2016 SPY, adjusted price](https://preview.redd.it/xhdv9f1qvvk41.jpg?width=1683&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d7aea6c22393b9dfeb442c13281cd83f407d41cf)\n\nComparing Fig 3 & 4, I believe we can have an educated guess as to how the rest of the year may play out.  We may eventually test sub 350 SPY this year but can be reasonably assumed we wont reach now ATH's the rest of the year.  \n\n[\\(Fig 3.\\) SPY 7\\/31\\/2015 - 12\\/31\\/2015, adjusted for dividends ](https://preview.redd.it/622yjtlfzvk41.jpg?width=1677&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b3ace5bb700be4544bc19b3c185327cb0a2c943f)\n\n[\\(Fig 4.\\) SPY 2\\/21\\/2019 - 3\\/5\\/2020](https://preview.redd.it/bfg0xluszvk41.jpg?width=1684&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=678dc9e60ac86c3bc9f8e68b8eb9299fe2e68e2b)\n\nTLDR; Long strangles on literally anything for heteros; Short front month VIX futures + Long second/third month VIX futures for the bi-curious; SPY 280p 3/20 for the raging homosexual.", "created_utc": 1583429598.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fdyr1i/time_series_comparison_to_2015_may_indicate_flat/", "is_self": true}
