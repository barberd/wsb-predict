I just had to hoodwink the mods who only read titles not actual pristine content like this isn't:    \n     \nImagine a job where (even as a junior position) you get paid a comfortable salary with eggs and bennyfits AND you get to vote on/at least see the results of decisions which will almost certainly impact both the American markets AS WELL AS specific stocks. Imagine being in a position where at a minimum 40% of people hate your guts and probably send you incoherent death threats on the daily, and yet no one in your position ever says \"Yea, I quit, this isn't worth it, and I'd prefer not to continue doing this.\" There are professional athletes who on paper make 200x what a junior Senator makes and yet you never see a Senator say \"Yea, I'm hanging the cleats up, I can't do this anymore for my health or because I want to spend more time with my family.\"    \n     \nOnly two things could make these facts true:    \n\n     \n1) Reps, Senators, other elected officials, and the Pres get access to the best Gator Tails and Women who can be paid to have daddy issues    \n     \nOR     \n    \n2) All of 1, and you get to just straight up practice market manipulation... like being the CEO of a bank, airplane, or car manufacturer except you have the Printer password and access to the overpriced toner to print funds to fill your pockets. Anyways, just explained the American political system.    \n    \nFor those still reading, thank you for taking the time to consider my application to Wendy's as a Fry Specialist.", "created_utc": 1587885303.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g8a39g/from_the_guy_who_gave_you_the_american_ceo/", "is_self": true}
