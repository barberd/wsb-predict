{"id": "hc2xxl", "title": "Bullish signal on HUYA", "selftext": "**tl;dr -** Positions:\n\nHUYA 7/17 20c for a safe bet\n\nHUYA 7/17 25c for the hopefuls\n\nHUYA 9/18 25c (finals season). I only have 7/17 positions btw because I'm poor.\n\nAlright, squad. Here's why I think HUYA is a good medium-term play with bullish sigals.\n\n1. It's eSports season. Lockdowns are being reinstated across Asia for fears of a second wave. What else are people going to do besides watch eSports? This is what investors are thinking when they consider buying shares in HUYA. \n\n2. Every year, in July, the price of the stock starts to run up and culminates in August/September (finals season). The stock price this year hasn't recovered from Rona yet but the pattern still holds. I'm expecting it to run up to $25 by August.\n\n3. HUYA is Trump-proof. It's way more international than Chinese tickers like JD, BABA, etc. That's why it's up while those are down. More importantly, **it's not on the list of companies that could be delisted**. \n\n4. I've been watching this ticker and it's been jumping AH everyday for the past 5 days, which indicates that international money is driving the overnight gains. I believe HUYA is relatively decoupled from US stock market sentiment, which makes it safer because I don't have to worry about retail panic selling if SPY drills or something dumb like that.\n\n5. HUYA is Rona news-proof. In fact, bad news is good for the stock price because more people will be staying home and watching eSports.\n\n6. I've been following the charts for the past 5 days, and every time there's a dip, the price inevitably shoots back up within the hour. Bullish. This thing wants to climb. \n\n7. Finally, AND THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT POINT - it hasn't received any attention on WSB for the past month which makes me infinitely more confident in this play. This point is invalid if my DD makes it to the front page.\n\n*This is my first DD y'all. I'd like to thank the autists who brought AMD, SDC, TAK, WMT, JD, & DLTR to my attention. For those who pumped tankers and PCG, fuck you.*", "created_utc": 1592581297.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hc2xxl/bullish_signal_on_huya/", "is_self": true}
