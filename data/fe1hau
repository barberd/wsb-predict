Las vegas just had their first case of Coronavirus and is bound to spread across the US.  With the lack of Asian travelers and gamblers along with the fact that casinos are absolute Germ breeding grounds, within a month no one will be there go gamble or party.  I could see this pushing Caesars over the top to the point they go BK once again.  With their earnings coming in Late May, I am all in on $10 and $11 puts expiring 9/19/20.  Their earnings will explain how absolutely fucked they are in this current environment.  This is literally free money.  Look at their monthly chart, this shit is getting hammered and will not be rebounding any time soon.", "created_utc": 1583440053, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fe1hau/caesars_czr_puts/", "is_self": true}
