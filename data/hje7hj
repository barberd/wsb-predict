They have been funded by govt grants 2x in the 10's of millions for 2 anti-viral therapies and have exclusive worldwide patent rights on their drugs...\n\nWhat do they do? They try to specifically create drugs for administration via the oral route of which 2 are anti-viral medications and 1 is on the market and the other is in clinical trials testing against yellow fever and COVID in Brazil but has already completed P1 trials for other virus studies with good results.\n\nThey have a NDA pending on a medication which reduces random swelling/inflammatory attacks (HAE) which randomly kills people. They also created an anti-viral drug and got EUA during the swine flu epidemic in the USA back in 2009. The 2 drugs I just listed should bump the price/share to $20 while they're currently trading at 5/share.\n\nNow here's the real kicker.... They have a Broad spectrum Anti-viral which works against 20 different virus families/types in the lab and looks to have stronger promise towards targeting Covid than Remdesivir (yea the mediocre anti-viral all over the MSM/news)... Check these links out for the info... recent news which is just more **Proof BCRX's drug is working as an effective anti-viral in the closest animal model to humans... (link below)**\n\n( [https://biocryst.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/galidesivir-stops-zika-viral-replication-primate-model](https://biocryst.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/galidesivir-stops-zika-viral-replication-primate-model) )\n\nAlso the Govt is trying to help them scale up production of this drug and it looks like their first big batch may come out early 2021.\n\nIf this drug releases results better than Remdesivir we might see BCRX hit $120-200/share if we were to generate the same market cap increase that Gilead experienced from Remdesivir...\n\nLinks below to see more info about Galidesivir:\n\n[https://www.biocryst.com/our-program/galidesivir/](https://www.biocryst.com/our-program/galidesivir/)\n\n[https://mstp.einstein.yu.edu/news/2319/einstein-invented-compound-now-being-tested-in-covid-19-clinical-trial](https://mstp.einstein.yu.edu/news/2319/einstein-invented-compound-now-being-tested-in-covid-19-clinical-trial)\n\n[https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/04/09/2014672/0/en/BioCryst-Begins-Clinical-Trial-with-Galidesivir-for-Treatment-of-Patients-with-COVID-19.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/04/09/2014672/0/en/BioCryst-Begins-Clinical-Trial-with-Galidesivir-for-Treatment-of-Patients-with-COVID-19.html)\n\n**Now here's the really stupid thing!!! shorts are Trapped shorting to one another at the moment and have become trapped to the tune of 15% of the float (because tutes/insiders own 90% of the float) with no free shares in the current price range AI algos likely trapped trading to one another and Forbes launched a hit piece to try and get a hold of retail shares to reduce the size of the \ud83c\udf46headed for the \ud83c\udf08 \ud83d\udc3b AI's that got stuck short.**\n\nThis has potential to go to the moon like SpaceX rockets once their P1/2 clinical trial on Galidesivir releases (likely to be published this month or next). The P1 trial is being done in Brazil (and **the only clinical trial in Brazil I currently know of which leads me to believe it's the one Dr. Fauci mentioned he is awaiting results on in last week's run down in front of congress**)\n\nThe TL:DR BCRX currently at $5/share stock might turn into 20-120 by Dec because of trapped shorts along with release of Clinical trial data on Galidesivir combined with their new HAE medication going into pharmacies this yr... Go long my dudes and may the tendies print you into Valhalla!
