I'm talking everyone from kids, olds, housewives, house cats. Anybody with $1200 in the market is all the sudden a trader, and they think they are geniuses cause they have made a 15% return the past few months. My guess is when these people see there investments drop, they will panic sell  when they see a 5% loss (I will be selling as well but as an autist myself I always sell l sense to sell the dip). Anyways that's enough DD from me.
