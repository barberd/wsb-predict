{"id": "f15x8x", "title": "You guys are retards", "selftext": "So retarded it crosses to genius. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I love China just as much as the next guy. I was there a few years back backpacking and tutoring and I even banged two Chinese chicks named Zoe. So trust me when I say that China has a special place in my heart and in my pants.\n\nThat being said,\n\nFuck the CCP. They have a whole world of pain coming their way (economically, socially, politically) and the only morally right thing to do is to point and laugh at them and collect some profit as they struggle to keep their Ponzi scheme running.\n\nOne of you retards said something along the lines of \u201cidk about FXI or ASHR. The gov is pumping and propping then up. They will keep raising if they continue pumping their markets\u201d. \n\nAnd a second retard said something like \u201cI bought a shitton of BABA right before the beer virus cause I thought they were American cause they were listed in the NYSE and must be a safe bet\u201d. No, BABA is listed in both NYSE and HKSE, that\u2019s why the CCP liquidity injections are propping it up: the CCP money is coming from Shanghai SE to HKSE. The price in the NASDAQ stock reflects the Chinese pumping to avoid arbitrage by slick traders.\n\nAnd it got me wondering \u201cis there any Chinese stock listed in an American market that is NOT listed in an Asian market and thus circumvent CCP liquidity injections?\u201d.\n\nFanhua Inc (FANH). Listed in Nasdaq. Berlin. Munich. Stuttgart. And France Stock exchanges. NOT LISTED ON ANY ASIAN EXCHANGE. It has offices in mainland Guangdong AND it\u2019s a goddammed Chinese insurance company. Doubly fucked.\n\nLast week, all Asian ETFs spiked due to the $400b the PBOC injected throughout the week to prop up Shanghai and Shenzhen (and  thus HK via their Stock Connect) stock markets. Which may, or may not, continue this week. Check out FANH. No spikes. Just a clear downtrend perfectly mirroring the economic chaos China is experiencing. And because whoever founded the company thought it would be cool to list it ONLY on dope ass American and European exchanges, they inherently cannot be propped up by Chinese liquidity. \n\nStock price is at $23. Market cap of 1.5b. Begging you to buy puts. While FXI and ASHR all spiked last week about 5%, FANH continued its downward bleed and lost about 8% in THAT SAME WEEK. They are NOT subject to liquidity injections because they are only listed in Europe and USA so they will continue their downward bleed. \n\nDiversify yo puts. \n\nALLAHU AKBEAR!!!!!\n\ud83e\udd62\ud83d\udc3c\ud83e\udde8\ud83d\udca3\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5\u2620\ufe0f\u2620\ufe0f\u2620\ufe0f\n\nTldr FANH puts", "created_utc": 1581236716, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f15x8x/you_guys_are_retards/", "is_self": true}
