Basically the stock 10x and even went higher after a secondary offering was announced. Surreal shit. It all has the feel of end of cycle garbagio high stakes gambling from the last two guys at the table. Nevertheless, I am one of those guys and partook in a little chicanery into the close.\n\nBIG FUCKING MOVERS in healthcare today. Some of them are recent IPO's, thinly traded piece of shits -- totally and unequivocally lottery tickets. Am I right?\n\nHere are some that crossed my radar today.\n\nMYOV +120%, ATNX +37%, FULC +30%, CABA +29%, MDCO +19%, CRSP +18%, CYAD +16%, CALA +16%, MGTA +16%, SRRK +14%, ODT +13%, ETNB +13%, PRVL +12%, DRNA +12%, WVE +12%, OSMT +12%, AXLA +12%, MTEM +12%, SDC+11%, XBIT +11%, ARQL +11%, LVGO +11%, AXSM +11%, CLVS +11%, TBIO +10%, BCYC +10%, NTLS +10%, EVEN +10%, ARDX +10%, GOSS +8%, NERV +8%.\n\nUnderstand something, faggots, this is NOT normal trading behavior.
