Why does this happen?\n\nSimple, we want to see something happen that we personally believe in, but shouldn't financially believe in. \n\nNow what should we look for? What should we believe in? \n\nReally fucking simple actually: Don't pay attention to the news. Do NOT trade the news. Never trade the fucking news. Do one thing only. Look at price action. If you can't see why something large is going up (not some shitter penny stock), why SPY isn't passing 2820 when Oil went to fucking -35$, it means that the Sellers aren't ready yet. They still buy, go look at dark pools. Buying is still happening. \n\nWhat can cause SPY to stay up? Look at Oil for June, barely crossed $21 a barrel. Stabilized around 21.17. Dark pools are going down but not enough. We aren't breaching 2820 by much, yet. Can we go red tomorrow? Sure. In my view we are going to be green off stim, oil going up/stabilizing, and again, dark pools STILL buying.\n\nWill we drop soon? Yeah, my view is that 2925 mark is where we decide on 3000 or 2750 (or way way below, but we don't do that math yet).\n\nStop reading shit here that confirms bias. Stop bagholding to -99%. Start entering stop losses. Don't take DD as be all end all. Learn how to read some indicators. Find SMART people to talk to. Literally the only thing that saved my portfolio was blocking out all the noise and focusing on price action and whatnot.\n\nPrice will create the news, not news creating the price. Events are the catalyst, nothing else. Think otherwise? How are we fucking not -5% limit down after oil went negative? How are we still going up for \"no reason?\" \n\nLots of questions, only order flow, price action, and understanding the really really big picture can give you a glimpse. Bet with the smart money, don't try to beat it. \n\night im done rambling SPY 20P 4/24\n\n\nAlso my view is that market is donezo by like weds or friday. almost went in on some PUTS today but i didn't, let's hope I'm right and that we all print soon.", "created_utc": 1587435472.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g56myw/dd_on_dd/", "is_self": true}
