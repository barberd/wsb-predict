Some news media outlets were reporting that the prospect of someone like Elizabeth Warren as President caused a sell off in the stock market. This is an EXTREME misdirect! I am surprised that not many people have realised that the stock market sell off is not caused by the correlation of this political event. \n\nYesterday, the Federal Reserve issued a new form of 'Loan' to address problems in the repo market. The federal reserve has committed to injecting $90bn in three $30bn two-week repo operations this week, enabling banks to borrow cash and tide them over the end of the third quarter. Today however, the demand for cash was $62 Billion dollars with only $30 Billion dollars injected. \n\nEssentially, today is an example of how the liquidity in the market has been drying up to such a point that banks do not have enough cash to meet their end of quarter obligations. The end of the quarter is October 10. The federal reserve has had to issue more money through repo than last week and likely will have to issue much much much more in the future .\n\nIt is my thesis that this problem is a direct cause of interest rate policy which is leaving the fed with little firepower to fight a rising divergence in liabilities to assets. With a large amount of sovereign debt (30%) now carrying a negative yield, these bonds themselves become transformed from asset to liability. In addition to this, negative interest rates are explicitly deflationary in nature as less money is repaid than borrowed. Putting two and two together, negative interest rate policy will continue to have a deflationary affect on assets while contributing to a negative feedback loops of rising liabilities in world economy. \n\nIn the face of this, banks are now knowingly holding negative yielding bonds and not selling for a profit as prices have soared. The banks would rather use the fed repo facility for liquidity than sell some liabilities to create assets. This is really not a good sign and surely demonstrates how the federal reserve is losing control of its monetary policy. \n\nMy DD?\n\n I think the banks refusing to sell treasuries for massive gains is not a good sign because this means that they're scared of something even worse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood short opportunity in US treasuries, Long Gold &amp; Silver, Long precious metal mining companies \n\n\\*bear gang revives from the dead\\*", "created_utc": 1569404841, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d9107p/there_is_no_one_running_this_insane_asylum/", "is_self": true}
