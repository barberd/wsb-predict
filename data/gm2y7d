{"id": "gm2y7d", "title": "Gold/silver miners and why AUY will rise 20% in the next few months", "selftext": "Simply put, as you've probably seen in the gold/silver futures last night and JPow comments about printing ad infinitum (we print digitally), we have seen some spectacular gains in silver and gold lately. \n\nSo I'm sure you're wondering how to take advantage of this. \n\nIf you're a bear, you're thinking, this printing can't go on forever, the dollar is losing value, I want to play silver and gold. AND NOT BUY PUTS which have fucked me over. \n\nIf you're a bull, you're looking for another retarded way to make easy money off calls.\n\nFirstly, some trends which are interesting to look at:\n\n1. Get a GLD/SLV yearly chart out and notice that metals tend to make runs on [US election years](https://www.sbcgold.com/blog/precious-metals-fare-election-year/)\n\n2. Historically precious metals (particularly silver) tend to make runs in the summertime\n\n**Now I present to you the gold miners.**\n\nPerfectly placed to take advantage of this. Wait - you might be thinking - why not just buy $GDXJ? Well because those calls are expensive as fuck and WSB is always after a good deal. \n\nUsing the fact that $NEM (Newmont, largest gold producer) has already hit those 2012 peaks, it is a no brainer that as gold and silver continue to run, other miners will follow in their wake. They all sell the same product. \n\nSo which one?\n\n**Let's have a look at a smaller gold producer as our example, $AUY (Yamana Gold)**\n\nA Canadian miner with interests in BOTH gold **AND** silver. You heard me right. Best of both worlds. They are diversified and well placed to take advantage of these swings in precious metals. \n\nIn their revised guidance they will be producing just shy of 800k ounces of gold and 10.5m ounces of silver. Their gross margins will explode as energy prices fall to historic lows and silver and gold prices continue their upward trend. Gold and silver move up due to the central banks around the world issuing stimulus. The gold to silver ratio was recently as high as 85, when historically it hovers around 60 so there is a lot of movement for silver in particular to \u2018catch up\u2019. \n\nAUY has also [recently sold a copper mine for a billion dollars](https://www.yamana.com/English/investors/news/news-details/2019/Yamana-Gold-Announces-Agreement-to-Sell-the-Chapada-Mine-for-Total-Consideration-Over-10-Billion-Delivering-Significant-Improvements-to-the-Balance-Sheet-and-Shareholder-Returns/default.aspx) thus paying off half their debt and ensuring they have a stable financial outlook for the future. \n\nThese calls are cheap. AUY has still a lot of room to go to make the levels seen in 2011/12 as their ceiling and potentially even further depending on bullish sentiment on gold and silver. \n\n\nHence the play here for now is to buy July and October calls on the miner of your choice. As I'm poor like you, I've gone 25 each in **AUY 6c 7/17 and AUY 7c 10/16**. \n\nThese calls are cheap and practically guaranteed to print tendies if gold and silver keep moving. They have great open interest, good volume and IV gang will LOVE the trajectory AUY is moving on.\n\n**Bear case** - why hasn\u2019t AUY gone up to $6 already? Because since the short squeeze bubble of silver in 2012, and the global recovery since 2008, silver and gold have been on a general downtrend and were not considered useful hedges in the good times. \n\nAlternatively, if you want a bigger producer, try going for $GOLD (Barrick Gold, second largest producer) 30c at expiries from July onwards depending on your tastes. $KGC is another solid bet, 9/10c would be a good shout. Maybe someone else can provide some DD on other producers. \n\nTLDR: buy **AUY 6c 7/17 and AUY 7c 10/16** to take advantage of BOOMING silver and gold prices\n\n**[Positions](https://gyazo.com/00af7a4d64353b3ac8a51d1b364ad693)**", "created_utc": 1589813814.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gm2y7d/goldsilver_miners_and_why_auy_will_rise_20_in_the/", "is_self": true}
