Like the true autist i am i also bought an /M2K long contract, with 0 fucking downside protection because i wanted to protect what i had pocketed catching some chorts from the top. On top of that, didn\u2019t set any stops. I had 100% conviction in some sort of bounce today and didn\u2019t want to get my stops hunt. But nope, we make bear history instead. I\u2019m refusing to take the L on these and am perfectly expecting to get my account nuked down to 0 after the margin call. (This isn\u2019t a big account, it fluctuates from $500-$5k depending on how fucking retarded i get sometimes). But fuck that. If we can literally lop off 13 weeks of gains in basically two days we should be able to bounce fucking 3% into the end of the week. \n\nWhat i\u2019m fully expecting: *Narrator: there was no bounce*\n\nTLDR: All you fucking idiots learn how to hedge correctly. You\u2019re all fucking retarded for being so balls deep into longs. And this one time i break my own rules i too wear it thinking that -100+ SP handle day was already extreme. \n\nOnce Europe comes online we\u2019ll see if they still have appetite for more selling. Should be happening here in an hour or two.", "created_utc": 1582697532, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9ovc4/were_bearflagging_perfectly_in_futes_currently/", "is_self": true}
