They claim they\u2019re systems so retarded it can\u2019t handle the volume by its users? But for some reason it never crashes on really big up days. \nIn my short bus resident opinion, Robinhood knows most of us are emotional as fuck and can\u2019t hold our positions. They know we have no clue what the hell we\u2019re doing and if the market\u2019s down we\u2019ll panick sell like our stonks have the Corona Virus. If this retarded ass app didn\u2019t shut down today the market might have hit circuit breaker level 3. But now we\u2019ll never fucking know.\nKind of weird literally everything on the app is functional except for trading. \nAnyways fuck this bullshit app thank the Tendie God Martin Shkreli that I was locked out due to PDT restrictions. Fuck Robinhood. Fuck Wuhan. Fuck Gay Bear Gang. Stonks only go up, and let\u2019s see the FED inject $1 Trillion into the market.", "created_utc": 1583763320, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffva2c/robinhoods_autistic_attempt_to_maniuplate_the/", "is_self": true}
