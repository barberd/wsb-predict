If you get assigned, once you buy the stock, immediately sell calls.\n3. At some point, hopefully exit the stock for profit. If you've done it right, you've made money on (1) the puts you sold (2) capital gains on stock shares and (3) the calls you sold\n\nThis is not a new strategy. Somebody on another investing subreddit has mentioned it before. But, I'm curious if anyone does those on stocks with high option premiums.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I am looking at right now is specifically TSLA. For example, you could sell Jul 26 220 Puts for 6.91.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's say the stock drops below that value - you then buy it, and then sell calls essentially at your breakeven price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe stock would have to drop at least like 30 points before you lost a good chunk of money. But, this seems like a pretty good strategy and potentially easy way to make almost $1k every few weeks on TSLA (especially if you don't get assigned the stock). Of course, this is ideal for stocks that you think have bottomed. But, I am missing something here? This seems like an easy way to make a good amount of money in a short period of time.", "created_utc": 1562715321, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cb8r3j/triple_wheel/", "is_self": true}
