Screenshot taken today as of this posting.\n\n[https://imgur.com/QoijbRl](https://imgur.com/QoijbRl)\n\nNormally, OTM options are cheaper than ITM options, as you are taking more risk.\n\nIn this case with SQ, you indeed get to pay a lower premium for OTM call options, so you would think if it does indeed do well on earnings (like it did), rising above your strike price, you should make more money than the guy that put the same amount of money on a ITM call who had less risk, right?\n\nBut if you look at the screenshot I posted, lets say yesterday you bought 78.5 Calls, you see they went up 87.5%.\n\nHowever if you bought even more OTM calls at 80.5 yesterday, yes they were cheaper to pay for, but the percentage gain was only 30%.\n\nOn a raw dollar basis, you put in $1000, you get $1875 back, vs $1300 with the 80.5 calls. \n\nYou would have been better off buying ITM calls that were more expensive and less risky as they gained more after earnings in percentage terms.
