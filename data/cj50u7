Okta soared after their IPO. Will Fastly do the same? All the research I'm doing sounds like Okta is more in the security sysadmin sector of cloud network computing wheras Fastly is... something else within the industry entirely? \n\nWill Fastly be screwed over from AWS or competitors or can they both exist in harmony, or will Fastly get squeezed out?\n\nIs anyone else doing DD / research and want to work together to get to the bottom of this? Hell, I'm thinking of starting a full on hardcore DD group, hmu if you wanna join. I haven't failed yet with my stock pics since I research the fuck out of a stock before going all into it, and I'm up 42% on my portfolio since only starting stocks 2 months ago.", "created_utc": 1564366900, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cj50u7/fastly_vs_okta_lets_start_a_hardcore_dd_group/", "is_self": true}
