Let's be honest Elon will never sell meaningful volume on this truck.\n\nFord and GM slept fucking good last night after seeing this disaster. \n\nThe Top reasons people buy trucks\n\nThey fucking hunt, do you think a mother fucker dressed in Carhartt would drive this\n\nThey do shit like mudding and driving on dirt roads, Elon stop it\n\nThey need to haul tools and shit for work, nobody and I mean nobody is pulling up on a job site with this fucking thing.\n\nThey pull campers and trailers, you think the lame ass dude pulling a camper arrives at  Yogi Bear Park with the family in the Cyber punk truck\n\nThey have a small dick, these fucks want something more flashy, women need to know they have money, a 40k garbage can on wheels won't cut it.\n\n I showed this truck to my test group of Beckys they thought it was movie prop. I told one of them, imagine we are on a date and the truck breaks down on the way home,  lucky for us I got an ATV charging in the back and I can give you a ride home still. She left me on \"unread\"\n\nOverall this truck fucks.\n\nThe only use I can think of for this truck is for local shoot outs, the homies can use the flat bed top as a shield. Sadly the windows don't catch bullets right now so put the new guys in the front.", "created_utc": 1574424894, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e006hc/tesla_truck_im_only_going_to_say_this_once/", "is_self": true}
