That would be good for us to know.\n\nMaybe you live in Utah and are noticing the mormon child marriages happening at age 15 instead of 14 more often because Extra Space Storage is keeping them for longer hours cutting down on mormon social life.\n\nFuck, maybe you even live in Kansas and just see a lot more people crying lately as they loose their jobs after the TMobile / Sprint merger.\n\nAny little pieces of information like that would be good to know.  I'm looking for leading indicators and special knowledge from areas where the mainstream media does not typically go, none of this, \"hey I heard this from Kai 'hasn't been forced out of NPR yet due to tenuous sexual harassment allegations' Ryssdal talk about this yesterday,\" bullshit.\n\nBetter yet, if you have any insider trading information, that would be even better.
