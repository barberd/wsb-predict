The stock price has been on a tear since bottoming out at $22.77, closing Friday at $36.45, but I think there is still room to run even higher.\n\nMultiple indicators that sales are up big time.\n\n* March 24: [Hiring 400 workers](https://www.citizensvoice.com/news/chewy-hiring-400-amid-increased-demand-1.2610778)\n* March 29: [Hiring 6000 workers](https://foxsanantonio.com/features/coronavirus/americans-are-panic-buying-pet-food)\n* Homepage: *A message about current events: Dear Pet Parents, Chewy is always here for you. Due to high demand, current delivery times are running considerably longer than usual on food and supplies. Stay well and thanks for choosing us.*\n* An increasing number of reports across the country that animal shelters are completely empty, all dogs and cats adopted. These new owners obviously have to order pet food and since everybody now shops online, this means increased volume at Chewy, Amazon and Walmart\n\nEven if they miss the earnings due to cost increase, their future guidance will pump the price even further. My [position](https://i.imgur.com/dFkj6ft.jpg) is up 180% since March 20 and I'll hold a large chunk through earnings.", "created_utc": 1585524398.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frfoyd/chwy_earnings_play_april_2nd/", "is_self": true}
