You have less than two weeks to purge your account PART 2 - With proper images and stock cross-references.", "selftext": "Alright, my bad everyone. This last post was really lazy, and I realize that I had nothing in there this morning after waking up, and seeing 43 comments making fun of a shitpost I labeled as DD.\n\n#LET'S TRY THIS AGAIN\n\nThe initial post had one image in it, and it was made apparent to me that it showed no actual information, after reading comments this morning.\n\n[Here's the full image](https://i.imgur.com/NJ6gs2r.png) - It's SPY, on the one day, and we're focusing on the apparent downturn on Friday.\n\nThe reason I'm saying this is going to be a downturn, is because this sentiment is shared with multiple other stocks in the S&P and elsewhere:\n\n[Here's AMD in the same time period with no settings changed.](https://i.imgur.com/lSDnSmv.png) It appears further along in its downturn.\n\n[Here's Visa with the same downturn potential.](https://i.imgur.com/BjVeGPA.png)\n\n[Here's Microsoft](https://i.imgur.com/SK0YdlV.png)\n\n[Here's Apple](https://i.imgur.com/0BFDaR2.png)\n\n[Here's GM](https://i.imgur.com/bwoVCcW.png)\n\n[Here's JPM](https://i.imgur.com/YoY0QNK.png)\n\n[Here's GS](https://i.imgur.com/r6Jqjc4.png)\n\nWhat originally got me taking a look at this is the gobsmacking nature of the market, and the \"how could this possibly be up right now\" ideation which everyone has. I started taking a look at downward trends, and tried it from a week out. The key answer is: It's not. On a weekly basis, the market sentiment [is absolutely down, and appears to be falling like a rock](https://i.imgur.com/FjQST1e.png)\n\nThere's nothing really substantial about the MACD settings I have in here. They're a little more sensitive close in, and I prefer Exponential over Wilders because It seems to better predict significant movements.\n\n[When drawing support lines](https://i.imgur.com/jwbMUc4.png), taking into account the high, and moving toward the low with the opposite channel, there's a definitive direction taking place. The lower bollinger is midway through the channel, with the low indicating SPY ~190.\n\n[The four hour MACD has already crossed as of Tuesday (March 31st)](https://i.imgur.com/jPURern.png), and once the daily follows, which I am presuming it will, things are going to go down significantly. I'm envisioning an opposite reaction with at least the same force as the [bull trap which was set up here.](https://i.imgur.com/Ktmgr6v.png)\n\nTaking a look at the scale, and time on the daily, it appears that by next Friday, SPY is going to be following its 4 hour downward. It could be even closer if the oil talks do not go well. If they do, this sentiment may be pushed off until the following week.\n\nI do not recommend anybody hold calls for outside next week. I do not recommend that anyone hold stocks past next week, unless they're ~~bull~~(bear, I meant bear fuck...) ETFs.\n\nTo explain my sentiment, we're seeing decreasing volume on most stocks. I presume this is because everyone is of the same mind: this bull trend doesn't make sense. We're going to see more COVID deaths, company production is halted, and nothing is being manufactured. There's no way for cash injections to buoy a market which is literally producing nothing. Further, the price of oil will not either. The weekly sentiment is strong down, the 4 hour is peaking down, and this is across the board on all the stocks I've listed above. SPY will eventually follow the separate stock trends, and we're going to see some amazing losses.\n\nSuggested positions:\n\n   * [AAPL - 180p - 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/pYKw3fD.png)\n   * [AMD - 30p - 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/IIZYdVp.png)\n   * [JPM - 50p - 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/z5DzliZ.png)\n   * [SNE - 44p - 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/KEBLC4Z.png)\n   * [SPY - fuck, I dunno. Maybe 190p, but 180p maybe too - 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/dtMWnZm.png)\n   * [DIS - 70p? 65p? 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/PMU1DfA.png)\n   * [YUM - 40p/35p 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/3T4OKS6.png)\n   * [ALLY - they're fucked. I dunno. 6p, 4p - 15 may?](https://i.imgur.com/70ojmh9.png)\n   * [C - 15p - 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/W4cqqaQ.png)\n   * [GS - 100p - 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/3k2IW9G.png)\n\n\nOn Ally - they're probably going to go bankrupt. Most of their business is auto loan servicing, something no one has any interest in paying when they're going to need food and need to pay rent. Further, the federal government has had no discussions about auto loan bailouts. I looked into their 10k which was released in Feb, and 5/6ths of their loans are for cars. Further, 40% of those loans were made to people with a sub-700 credit rating. They have been getting into the mortgage game, but it's a modicum of their portfolio. I don't think they're making it out of this year alive.\n\nWe're seeing a pattern here right? All of those images above - The sentiment across the market is clear: we're plumbing depths, and you almost can't fuck this up. Buy a put, make sure the strike price makes sense a little bit, and get. dat. cash.\n\n#OH, one last thing\n\nI know he said he wasn't planning on it. I know that Trump has said he will not close the market, however I would say that closing the market would probably be in the country's best interest. I want you to think about that when you're buying close-in puts: there's a potential for the market to be closed, and if the market isn't open on exercise day, the option expires worthless. If I were Trump, I would be considering it. If I were an investor, I would also take this into consideration.", "created_utc": 1586091473.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fvde7p/let_me_try_this_again_with_more_info_i_apologize/", "is_self": true}
