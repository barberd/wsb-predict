My first DD, be hard.", "selftext": "TOO LONG DIDNT READ: 6/22 volume explodes from a typical 900k-2M range to 43M on news Apple wants to buy SONO. So I wanna buy SONO too. I'm broke af, but in big boy leaps hoping to ride the wave to $25.\n\nPositions: 2x SONO 15c 21/01/22 at $3.60 and 1x SONO 30c 21/01/22 at 1.05.\n\nCurrently up 33.33% on the 15c and 45.24% on the 30c. Hoping to buy a used Prius when this is all over. Options won't be exercised, only sold. I'm a degen tarder (trader?) like everyone else here, no air quote \"investing\" here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo... what is SONO? They make speakers, just google it. Why trader SONO? Ah, great question young dumb!\n\n* Rumor is Apple wants to buy it. This would be a great fit for three reasons. 1) SONO speakers sound good and are dick simple to set up and use. Apple loves products that reduce friction and allow immediate, deep engagement. 2) SONO makes its own speakers. Apple is on a vertical integration spree peaking with the announcement of ARM processors into Macs. It only makes sense to have a firm that produces speakers and drivers be brought into the fold. 3) SONO sells music to businesses via a third party license agreement, see below. this molds into Apples current service first business approach and would allow them to sell Apple Music + speakers + Siri to businesses.\n* Over 30% of SONO customers are repeat customers. This is important because repeat customers tend to stay loyal, meaning less money to maintain customers or more money to spend acquiring new customers. What other fruit named company does this?\n* SONO sells to businesses. Remember when stores were open and they played music? Well music ain't free and businesses can be sued for playing shit they didn't license properly. SONO resells music from Soundtrack Your Brand through three packages. The pricing is at 50, 80 and 100/month for business that are 1000, 2000 and over 3000 sqft. SONO leases them the speakers for free and provides all the support for them.\n* SONO sells to consumers. They're stuck at home and probably want to play some f\\*ck music when they get out the old fleshlight or hitachi magic wand. Other things go brrrrrr too!\n* Over 70% is owned by institutional investors, meaning they trust that it will at least not tank.\n* Earning Q1 2020 were 0.60 per share, up from -0.28 the previous quarter. Q2 2020 earnings were -0.48 per share. Q3 out in August\n* It busted through, then pulled back on the $15 resistance. One more push and It'll get through on good momentum\n\nBoring stuff\n\n* Current price - 15.00\n* 52 week high - 16.88\n* Resistance levels - 15.20, $15.68, 16.00, 16.88\n\nNews\n\n* \ud83d\udc026/26 - Laid off 12% of current employees, approx. 170, exec. pay reductions, and closing stores saving $25-30 million overall to be reflected in Q3\n* \ud83d\udc026/22 - Apple May Potentially Acquire Audio Company Sonos, Citron Research Speculates\n* \ud83d\udc3b6/18 - SONO raises $13.9 million via stock sale range $13.25-$13.50\n* \ud83d\udc3b6/16 - ISS - EVA downgrades SONOS INC from HOLD to UNDERWEIGHT. \n* \ud83d\udc026/11 - Morgan Stanley Lifts Sonos' Price Target to $19 From $13, Keeps Rating at Overweight\n* \ud83d\udc026/any - Numerous reports of unusual option activity related to SONO calls\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Look at that volume, mmmm](https://preview.redd.it/nw4tqzxd5d751.png?width=2396&format=png&auto=webp&s=73df6663c8db0414af0772076026daacf3f5c3a8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Looks like come of you clever ones got in, good job](https://preview.redd.it/5j35b43tad751.png?width=1256&format=png&auto=webp&s=17ba70eec5652ea54b6f1ba9dabf152999b8de87)\n\nSo the play... today it hit just over 15.20 to form a double top while SPY was eating itself alive. If you're a true WSBer, buy a long call at open Monday. If you can hold your orgasm longer than two seconds then look for a dip next week and get in on 2+ month out calls. Look to sell anywhere above $16.50\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - SONO calls on rumor Apple might buy them. Watch for IV crush you degens. **LONG LIVE KING JPOW**\n\nEdit: wait to see how things shape up Monday before buying in", "created_utc": 1593226531.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hglrmp/wireless_home_tendies_with_sono_my_first_dd_be/", "is_self": true}
