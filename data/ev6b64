Phase 1 basically all that will be needed to be in use.", "selftext": "So chime in..I know there's other contenders in this race, but MRNA has a massive ally with GOVT, NIH-GOVT- resources. And closer to a nice GOVT contract. What say you. Disclosure, I obviously have a decent stake in MRNA. Some of you might argue the GOVT is the one most hurting for budget, I say nay, not in a health scare like this. Private Biotech vs US GOVT, my bet will be with the GOVT all the effin time.
