SO, with that being said, lets jump right in this bitch\n\nVRT is a holding company/global provider of digital infrastructure. In December 2019, VRT was listed on the nasdaq, after combining with a giant blank check SPAC company, GS Acquisition Holdings. GS Acquisition Holdings is sponsored by two affiliates of Goldman Sachs. One of these affiliates, David Cote, who is also a former CEO of Honeywell, is going to serve as the executive chairman of VRT. And the CEO of VRT, Rob Johnson (30-years of digital infrastructure experience) is going to remain as CEO. They held a press conference at which David and Rob sucked each other off and said they are looking forward to be long term partners, and they look forward to working with goldman sachs to accelerate their product. Right now they\u2019re operating in 130 countries, and the company that VRT combined with also raised $595 million for the merger. \n\nThe company says it sees an addition 1BILLION dollars in revenue for 2020, for a total of 5.5B.\n\nGoldman Sachs and JP Morgan are VRT\u2019s financial advisors (Brrrr) \n\nIn addition, VRT was in nearly major 40 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q1 2020. \n\nMarket cap is 5B, currently trading at $13.82.\n\nVRT went from $4.75 to $15 in three months. UP 300%\n\nMajor volume spike in the last few days, and based on price action it looks like the stock is going through a short term consolidation right above a major support level (Feb highs). In my autist opinion, this shit is doing a textbook retest and failure to break support, and will be on its way to around $25 by August). \n\nTHE PLAY - Load up on $17.5  8/21 Calls sometime this week, as the stock price shouldnt go much lower than current price. THE CALLS ARE LITERALLY WORTHLESS RIGHT NOW\n\nCan\u2019t go tits up.\n\n..right?", "created_utc": 1592710391.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hczywr/autistic_dd_on_vertiv_vrt_maximum_tenderloins/", "is_self": true}
