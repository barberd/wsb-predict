Markets will overreact as usual but once people realize the US actually has good medical infrastructure and we have more recoveries than deaths, markets will ease up with the fears.\n\nAlso I\u2019m expecting all analysts to start updating their forecasts to some really bearish bullshit. However this is good for us bulls, super bearish forecasts always get beat unless the company is actually shit. But even companies like SNAP (extremely shit management) have beaten expectations before, so I am optimistic.\n\nNot saying this will happen, for all we know the US could stay the same and we recover even quicker then expected, But until cases in the US start to pop up I\u2019d wait to buy the dip.\n\nNow also understand shit doesn\u2019t just automatically get better overnight, \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b might win for weeks, but the day US cases start to pop up like crazy \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b better realize their days are dwindling and us Bulls will rise up once again.\n\nJust my opinion I am retarded.", "created_utc": 1582564788, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f8uiw4/the_worst_is_still_to_comeif_it_ever_does/", "is_self": true}
