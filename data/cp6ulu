I was just wondering how happy you guys are with their mobile app. I\u2019ve used TOS before and thought it was pretty good, especially compared to RH (although RH\u2019s fees make up for it imo). Just wanted to get your thoughts on this. Thanks!", "created_utc": 1565580727, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cp6ulu/ib_mobile_app/", "is_self": true}
