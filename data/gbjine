{"id": "gbjine", "title": "Costco Guy: Update to $COST Play", "selftext": "So as I told you guys 3 weeks ago, Costco foot count in the warehouses is down across the board, sales is going to dip hard this month with everyone stocking up in March. We had 5% at grocery stores on the Chase Freedom and overall fears about the virus.\n\nI am sure all the data finance guys buy early is starting to show, and despite the FED pumping the markets up, Costco continued to slide despite being one of the most active businesses over the past 30 days.\n\nPrevious Strike - Sell 322.5C 5/8 for $5.00 premium and I closed it out for a 95% gain on the money. I could have let this ride, but why let a rogue way kill you?\n\nI am looking for an earnings play, and to be honest, I think they Costco is going to be pretty shit. They increased their dividend, took out a new bond offering to pay the old one, and had CAPEX this Q with an acquisition of Last Mile Logistics for a billion.\n\nLastly, after posting my initial thread, the price of the strike mooned with the announcement of the dividend. I will have to remember that next time because I was almost -50% in a day. I still absolutely believed in the play, and just let it ride.\n\nEarnings play is coming up, but IV is low so I may have to wait until 5/8 to see if I see an increase. I am bearish overall. I will post when I execute it.\n\nOriginal Post - [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1sbdb/cost\\_play\\_dd\\_inside/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1sbdb/cost_play_dd_inside/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)\n\nP.S. I am selling the 315/320C right now for 5/8 as well. Please bring this sub back to DD and checking on hard cheese futures for Papa John shorts.
