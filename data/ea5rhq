{"id": "ea5rhq", "title": "College Football Playoff RSVP - call option", "selftext": "For background there's this thing called CFP-RSVP.com which is kind of like an option market for CFP tickets. You can buy the right to buy a ticket to the national championship game at face value. So it's kind of like a call option. But instead of the risk being the likelihood of the price of the security going up, the risk is whether or not the team you bought the option for wins their first playoff game.\n\nSo the price for the upper deck at the time of me writing this post are:\n\nCLEM: $450.00\nLSU: $699.60\nOSU: $405.00\nOU: $81.00\n\nThe face value for the upper deck tickets are $425.00\n\nSo it seems to me that there should be some equation that you could apply to decide whether or not these are a financially good decision to buy if you assume you'll be able to sell them for $1000.00 in the event that your team wins.\n\nFor instance - Per the ESPN FPI, LSU has a 67.4% chance to win the game. So that means OU has a 33.6% chance according to them.\n\nIdk - I don't possess the knowledge, but it seems to me this should be something you can actually work out the math on.\n\nAnd then I think you could also technically hedge your odds by literally betting money line on the the other team as well, right? \n\nWhen I look at it - I feel like OU's RSVP price is criminally undervalued based on the risk vs reward, but I can't prove it.
