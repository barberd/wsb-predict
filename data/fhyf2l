{"id": "fhyf2l", "title": "Teva Pharmaceutical Industries", "selftext": "As the world locks down and stays home, people will buy less of everything.  Except one thing \u2013 pharmaceuticals.  Actually they\u2019re going to buy a lot more of them because Corona needs a lot of treatment.   But they'll also still need the stuff they're already buying, and there's less supply now.\n\n[India has suspended exports of a lot of drugs, including antibiotics, and vital, difficult-to-make ingredients (API\u2019s).](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/04/global-supplier-india-curbs-drug-exports-as-coronavirus-fears-grow.html) The other main producer of these drugs and API\u2019s is China.  They seem to be slowly recovering and I hope they do, but I expect they won\u2019t be exporting much medicine for a while.\n\nTeva makes over 2,000 drugs, along with API\u2019s.  They make the whole range of drugs, including mental health drugs which many of you take or should be taking.\n\n**The good:**\n\n* Teva is one of the only reliable suppliers of a lot of drugs that are or soon will be in desperate shortage around the world. A bottle of antibiotics that costs them \\~10 cents to make will be the difference between life and death for a lot of people (Corona secondary infections, plus normal antibiotic usage); potential for big margins   \n* Their facilities are mostly in Israel, the US and Europe, with only a minor facility in China and one in India.  [They do not expect any material supply disruptions](https://www.tevapharm.com/news-and-media/latest-news/update-on-COVID-19/).  They pay attention to supply chains and manage supply risk ([see 10-K, 3 weeks ago](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/818686/000119312520044221/0001193125-20-044221-index.htm); if they had any risk from Corona they could put a paragraph in there and cover their ass from lawsuits, but they didn\u2019t.  That\u2019s a strong signal)\n* When a Corona vaccine/treatment is found, even though Teva probably won\u2019t invent it, I think they\u2019ll be involved in producing it \u2013 the whole world will need it ASAP and Teva is a huge % of global pharma production capacity\n* After Corona fucks off and all is well, everyone will realize that it\u2019s a good idea to have a stockpile of the drugs you need to live, so Teva should have strong sales, even at high prices\n* [Some US politicians are calling for on-shoring production of antibiotics etc.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/business/economy/coronavirus-china-trump-drugs.html) Building that up from scratch would be very expensive.  Teva has a lot of IP and know-how that they could license (or Teva could just build more factories in the US)\n\n**Some of the reasons why the stock has gone down from $60+ a few years ago:**\n\n* The past few years \u2013 they\u2019ve been dogged by lawsuits, especially opioid-related.  (They didn\u2019t promote opioids like Purdue, they just made the generic, but that\u2019s enough to get sued)  They also have some patent litigation etc., which they\u2019ve taken reserves against and which are well-known in the market (read the 10-K for details).  Maybe helping to save the world will get them some goodwill and help them out here\n* The past week \u2013 because the market is stupid.  It\u2019s risk-off and deleveraging right now, so everything gets sold, even companies that actually benefit from the situation driving the sell-off\n* Another theory on this past week \u2013 oil prices have crushed shale/fracker bonds, and that spread to all kinds of corporate debt.  Teva has debt; I think the algos see high volatility in their debt and feed that into their model for the stock price, which makes the stock look riskier.  But 1) most of their debt is not due for years, 2) their debt is no riskier than it was last week (and maybe less risky than ever), and 3) it seems likely that Fed/government help is on the way for corporate borrowers\n* Another reason it went down is because I bought it.  On Wed I sold Tesla puts to buy it.  So obviously Tesla tanked the next day and so did Teva   \n\nYou should do your own research of course.  But the above was good enough for me, I have shares and calls.", "created_utc": 1584100285.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhyf2l/teva_pharmaceutical_industries/", "is_self": true}
