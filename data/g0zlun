But if you run your account to 0 before that happens it doesn't matter. HEDGE YOUR POSITIONS OVERNIGHT. Hedge delta (and even vega if you want) EOD every day since the big moves happen at open. That way if SPY opens +5% you won't get fucked in the ass harder than your wife is getting reamed by her boyfriend. There will be plenty of time to close out the hedges if it starts going down and you won't have to worry about PDT. Please for the love of \ud83d\udc3b hedge your positions people.", "created_utc": 1586842000.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0zlun/advice_from_one_to_fellow/", "is_self": true}
