Those puts have printed massively since then. \n\nHere's my prediction for the investment grade corporate bond market:\n\n**Tickers: LQD, HYG, JNK**\n\n**Move: Puts**\n\nSo for the last three days I have been watching treasury yields rise sharply and scratched my head as to why while the equities indices were making new 52 week lows. For the past two weeks yields have been crashing as big money exited equities and into \"havens\" like treasuries. Except all of that reversed course on Monday as most of you might have noticed. How are those TLT calls doing, guys? \n\nThis has lead me to read a ton more about the corporate bond market and the possibility of a fuck-ton of downgrades coming for highly-levered companies being hammered by coronavirus. \n\nThen there is this jewel:\n\n[Treasuries and Junk Bonds Reverse Safety Trades. Investment-Grade Bets Falter, After the BBBs\u2019 Worst Day Ever.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/treasuries-and-junk-bonds-reverse-safety-trades-investment-grade-bets-falter-after-the-bbbs-worst-day-ever-51583856737)\n\n\n> Treasuries are falling and high-yield bonds rising as traders reverse some of their safe-haven moves from recent days.\n\n>But the most notable credit-market moves are happening in investment-grade bonds, which are extending declines after one of their worst sessions in decades.\n\n>Investment-Grade Debt One of the biggest exchange-traded funds tracking high-rated corporate debt, the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (ticker: LQD), was down 0.4% early Tuesday. The fund\u2019s 2.4% Monday decline marked its worst trading session since the financial crisis, and its eighth-biggest daily decline on record. While ETF prices provide a real-time gauge of market performance, they track a narrow group of bonds.\n\n>By a more comprehensive reading, Monday was the investment-grade market\u2019s second-worst day on record, and the declines were driven by the lowest-rated tier, known as \u201cthe BBBs.\u201d The gap (or spread) between yields on the ICE BofA U.S. Corporate Index, a broad benchmark of investment-grade debt, and comparable Treasuries widened by the most of any day on record other than Oct. 10, 2008, during the height of the financial crisis.\n\n>BBB bonds had their worst day on record on Monday, according to ICE BofAML Indices, in a single-day selloff that was more severe than any they experienced during the financial crisis. The BBBs\u2019 yield spreads over Treasuries widened by half a percentage point, the most of any single session in at least 23 years.\n\n>Investors have worried about the growth in that market over the past decade, which has left roughly half of the investment-grade corporate bond market rated in the three tiers closest to junk (BBB+, BBB and BBB-). No ETFs appear to track only BBB-rated corporate bonds, so it wasn\u2019t clear whether they were responsible for the losses in early Tuesday trading.\n\n>Treasuries U.S. Treasury prices were lower Tuesday, pushing yields of all maturities higher, as the market got a break from the buying pressure that came with Monday\u2019s stock-market selloff.\n\n>Benchmark 10-year and 30-year yields rebounded slightly from record lows, because investors were venturing out of the haven Treasury market and back into risky securities such as stocks and high-yield debt.\n\n>Junk Bonds While safe government debt was falling, the high-yield bond market was rebounding after suffering one of the worst sessions on record on Monday.\n\n>The two largest junk-bond exchange-traded funds\u2014the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG) and the SPDR Bloomberg Barclays High Yield Bond ETF (JNK)\u2014both climbed around 1.8% in early Tuesday trading.\n\n>Those gains follow the third-worst day for the junk-bond market in the 23 years that ICE BofAML Indices has followed it. The two trading sessions that saw a larger jump in the market\u2019s implied risk: Sept. 14, 2001, the first day of bond-market trading after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks; and Oct. 10, 2008.\n\n>The high-yield ETFs didn\u2019t experience similarly sharp losses on Monday. The iShares HYG fund lost 4.3%, its eighth-worst day on record, and the SPDR JNK fund fell 4.7%, its sixth-worst day. Still, both posted their worst daily declines since the financial crisis.\n\nCredit to /u/Nettletooth who posted this in /r/investing , who also had this to say:\n\n>My own commentary: This is sort of interesting. Hypothetically, BBB rated bonds should have rebounded roughly as much as BB,B, CCC, or worse ratings since they have somewhat similar characteristics here, but instead they got hammered.\n\n>There were some commenters talking about this a bit a few days ago, and it looks like they may be right: BBB bonds seem to be misrated currently in the market risk wise, a little bit like how MBS were often given a AA or AAA rating before the great financial crisis due to pressure placed on the ratings agencies by banks to give good ratings.\n\n>The bar is \"make this investment grade\", and it is entirely possible a lot of the BBB bond ratings really should be BB or B ratings, and pressure is causing rating agencies to overrate the bottom tier of investment grade bonds.\n\n>The expected effect of this would be for BB and B rated and worse junk bond funds to increase in value to something more close to BBB bond funds, and for BBB bond funds to drop based on the market as a whole re-rating them lower, even if the agencies did not actually change their ratings.\n\n>This is exactly what we are seeing, and it should be sort of interesting. The low end of corporate bond may not be as safe as thought.\n\nThis is where **LQD** comes in. **LQD** is the largest ETF holding of B and BBB rated corporate debt. \n\n[Breakdown of Holdings](https://i.imgur.com/06pMJq8.png)\n\n[Breakdown of Debt Quality](https://i.imgur.com/NfiBjgP.png)\n\nSome of the holdings include our friends Boeing, Deustche Bank, JPM, BAC, and others. Financials & energy, particularly hard hit during this downturn, are facing liquidity struggles (Fed handing out repos like water now)\n\nThese \"investment grade\" bonds used to be classic safe havens, like treasuries and gold. Well somebody realized they aren't anymore as of Monday. As the economy nears recession, bond markets do some wacky shit and no longer follow established trends. \n\nCorporate debt issuance combined with government debt issuance is about to rise to historic levels as companies struggle to meet liquidity requirements. \n\n[Tumble in bond yields will lead to \u2018the trade of our lifetime\u2019 in this investor\u2019s scenario](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/09/lawrence-mcdonald-tumble-in-bond-yields-the-trade-of-our-lifetime.html?&qsearchterm=trade%20of%20a%20lifetime)\n\nThe greatest risk to these so called \"investment grade\" bonds is an impending wave of downgrades due to cut revenue, liquidity issues, layoffs, all that jazz that comes with a recession. \n\nI can't time any of these downgrades, so I'm not calling any short term plays, but I think they are coming in the next few months and LQD and others like it are going to be tanking. \n\nThis is not dissimilar from 08 when junk MBS's were being boxed up and rated AAA. Corporate bond prices have a long, long way to fall. Coupled with an impending massive increase in private and public debt issuance (driving yields up), price risk to the downside is tremendous. \n\nTL:DR, 4/17 , 5/15 puts on LQD are still cheap, go ham", "created_utc": 1583986863.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhaofo/short_investment_grade_bonds_lqd_impending/", "is_self": true}
