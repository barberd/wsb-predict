You can imagine my surprise when today we pulled into the Manhattan Cruise Terminal at 3am and I see we had 2 god damn circuit breakers in one week.\n\nBefore the cruise started, Pence announced all tendies were safe and stonks only go up so I sold all my put positions (now worth upwards of $80k). Fuck me.\n\nFeel free to ask me questions about NCL and the cruise, what it\u2019s like to denounce homosexuality but still get fucked in the ass, or any other interesting topics.\n\nFuck.\n\nEDIT: We just received clearance from NYC officials to de-board. I\u2019ll believe it when I see it.
