I was asking them about business loans on investment property as well and they said interest rates are at 5.5%. Then I asked what the rate was 3 weeks ago; 3.625%. Apparently all banks are tightening up right as we\u2019re entering the summer season which is usually the hotter season for real estate. So hopefully there will finally be more supply than demand and house prices start falling. Not saying this will be half as bad as 2008, but may be a decent time to YOLO on some investment property. \n\nAlso:\n\nCCL 20c 1/21/22\nDAL 40c 1/21/22\nMRO 12c 1/21/22\nSPY 230p 10/16/20\n\nAlso loaded up on some BRKB and HLT because why not.", "created_utc": 1586882632.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1900f/housing_going_down/", "is_self": true}
