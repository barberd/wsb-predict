{"id": "hcb7du", "title": "Florida and Arizona have no other option but to shut down and nobody is paying attention.", "selftext": "**TLDR:** Some states have grown complacent and don't take social distancing and mask wearing seriously. From Memorial day onward, some of these places have started seeing exponential growth in cases which is guaranteed to overwhelm hospitals. Because the citizens don't think the virus is a serious threat, the only way to stop it will be statewide shutdowns. Governors won't acknowledge this because its politically inconvenient and will keep their states open as long as possible. That will make it much worse.\n\n**# Background**\n\nDuring the first wave of coronavirus, some states got decked, the citizens were scared shitless, and everything was shut down hard. The virus spread like wildfire throughout the North East, and everyone stayed home, socially distanced, and mostly wore masks. Because of this, the virus has faded dramatically in places like NY, NJ, and MA.\n\nOn the other hand, we have places like Florida and Arizona. They mostly shut down because of what was happening elsewhere. The citizens in these places interpreted the shutdown as unnecessary and job-killing. They're fatigued from the shutdown and nothing even really happened in their states.\n\n**# Catalyst**\n\nSo why does it matter? On June first, the 7-day moving average of case counts in Florida was 726. Right now the same 7-day moving average is over 2400. For some reason, April and May were boring. But starting in June, exponential growth started coming back. Perhaps Memorial Day served as a sort of kick-off event. Remember, this explosion in growth is a window into behavior 2-3 weeks ago.\n\nWhy can't they just continue life as usual and let the weak die? Because the entire population needs ICU beds. If there are no ICU beds available, they can't treat anyone with life threatening illnesses or injuries. Death rates will skyrocket for everyone, even those without COVID. Florida already has [less than 25% capacity left](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/icu-beds-short-supply-across-florida-state-struggles-coronavirus-spike-n1231451) and the new trend in case counts literally just started.\n\n\\# **Forecast and Timeline**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2urh0bdx4y551.png?width=610&format=png&auto=webp&s=afe806c67bd712f378150e313cd3455fad86339c\n\nThis is a forecast using exponential smoothing. I can provide all the code to run this forecast in the comments. The black line is the last month of cases. The purple is the forecast for the next 14 days. For context, New York, at its worst had roughly 10k cases a day. Italy only had around 6k/day at their peak. I'm too lazy to graph Arizona, but they're in the exact same situation.\n\nThis madness is going to be made worse by the fact that governors are choosing denial as their containment strategy. In both states, the governors are blaming increased testing as the reason for the spike. This hypothesis is easily disproved by the fact that hospitalization rates and % of positive test results are both increasing as well.\n\n**# The Play**\n\nRight now the market is pricing in a rosy recovery. I believe we will start seeing rolling statewide shutdowns this summer, starting with Florida and Arizona in the next month. This might bring the market back down to reality. So what is a realistic price for spy?\n\nThankfully a world-renowned valuation expert and NYU finance professor [just did a DCF valuation of SPY](https://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2020/06/a-viral-market-update-ix-do-it-yourself.html) at the beginning of June. Further, he did it for a variety of input values via Monte-Carlo simulation to give us a range of fair values. Here is the output:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ot07whaz6y551.jpg?width=1498&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b124e4dff48623327933db6050a7bd8f625e1b6a\n\nThe market closed Friday around the 75th percentile of what could be fair value. To be conservative, we could assume once rolling shutdowns are priced in, it will drop to the 50th percentile. This gives us a great opportunity for a 310/300 or 310/290 put spread for July/August. If that's not autistic enough, buy naked UPRO puts. I bought most of my positions this week. If we are down big Monday, I'd wait for a mid-week rebound to buy into this play.", "created_utc": 1592608968.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hcb7du/florida_and_arizona_have_no_other_option_but_to/", "is_self": true}
