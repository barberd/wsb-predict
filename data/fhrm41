I rode those things to a big gain today and decided to sell out for a large part of my portfolio. Literally 10 minutes before close I got antsy and bought 2 different puts for the largest positions I have ever taken in a company. I'm literally going crazy after seeing them shut down the parks and I can only imagine how much money I can make tomorrow. Problem is, do I sell tomorrow? I am more then happy with what I've made so far so I am not looking for 1000% gains or anything. \n\nI can post proof if people want but I don't really know that works. \n\nTLDR: DIS puts if you can.\n\n[Positions and Gains ](http://imgur.com/gallery/brj7aTm)", "created_utc": 1584062769.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhrm41/i_might_be_the_stupidest_but_luckiest_person/", "is_self": true}
