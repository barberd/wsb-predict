{"id": "ftv6eq", "title": "$F (Ford) Has Nowhere To Go But Up! ^", "selftext": "Anyway, I'm going LONG (Ford) $F, both calls and actual stock purchases.\n\nCouple reasons:\n\n1. Fords cut their dividend two weeks ago and they have closed plants, so all downside is already priced in.\n2. Both long term calls and the actual stock is dirt cheap trading at 6x earnings.\n3. Ford will not go broke, they pulled out as much cash as they could from their credit lines to weather the storm.\n4. The FED is buying corporate junk bonds so all Ford has to do is sell more bonds and they get free money.\n5. They make badass trucks, way cooler than anything Chevy or Dodge put out, lets be real Ford trucks are the standards.\n6. A lot of people are short selling the stock so we will likely see a short squeeze in the next couple days.\n7. They are retooling their plants to make medical supplies like Ventilators, etc.\n\nVery little downside, unlimited upside.\n\nOH AND THE MOST IMPORTANT REASON TO BUY FORD THAT I FORGOT TO MENTION!!!\n\nA few days ago there was a huge DD on the WSB homepage about why you should sell Ford. So I'm inverting that!\n\nEDIT Positions:\n\n$F $8 Call 6/19\n\n$F shares (I know gay)\n\n[2021 Ford Bronco with the OJ Edition Package Included](https://preview.redd.it/3zkpzy27chq41.jpg?width=840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8a9dad96e77348ade24924ed3d6112e569576476)", "created_utc": 1585863627.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ftv6eq/f_ford_has_nowhere_to_go_but_up/", "is_self": true}
