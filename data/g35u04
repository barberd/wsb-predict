{"id": "g35u04", "title": "Gilead play", "selftext": "As we know the potential treatment remdesivir from Gilead has driven the market higher today. I will go through what the drug is and the outlook moving forward. This is my opinion and not financial advice. I\u2019m a PhD pharmacologist working in the industry, as my \u201csource\u201d.\n\nMost people know that the leaked \u201cdata\u201d have been refuted by Gilead as misleading and we know that the US phase 3 trials are ongoing, while trials in China had trouble recruiting patients and were stopped. \n\nWhat is not priced in, in my opinion, is a more nuanced understanding of what the drug is and what it\u2019s competition in the market is.\n\nRemdesivir is an antiviral compound in a class of antivirals that has been known for 100 years and have moderate potency (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remdesivir). It is a nucleotide analog, of which there are many available on the market currently, including generics (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleoside_analogue#Examples).\n\nThese drugs have structures that mimic nucleotides, which are the building blocks of DNA/RNA, and the drugs work by stopping viral replication. The drug gets attached a growing new viral RNA strand, but the next building block can\u2019t get added to it; the RNA is terminated and the new virus ends up broken, unable to infect the next cell. Remdesivir is an adenosine nucleotide analog, which just means that it is mimicking a specific building block, called adenosine. \n\nThere is another one in development by Biocryst. If you\u2019re bullish on this drug they have a much lower market cap and could be a good play.\n\nHowever, in my opinion there is no reason to believe that mimicking adenosine offers an advantage over other drugs mimicking different building blocks. The end result is the same.\n\nSo in my opinion, the drug is unlikely to be any more than partially beneficial, if it succeeds at all. And if it does succeed, doctors will likely prescribe the cheap generic alternatives instead. \n\nIf we look at Gilead stock, over the past 3 months it is up 30%, and never experienced a real downturn during feb/March due to hype over remdesivir.\n\nI believe when the market realizes that this drug is not a cure, it will be bad for the market overall, and worse for Gilead.\n\n**TL;DR GILD 60p 5/29**", "created_utc": 1587142567.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g35u04/gilead_play/", "is_self": true}
