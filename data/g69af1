This is based on some of the more recent posts about oil and oil tankers. Here's the situation. All these dumb ass retail investors have sunk a lot of money into USO and other oil ETFs. But instead of buying oil, they're essentially buying oil futures contracts. USO works by buying the next month's futures contract. They've recently changed this to be 80% next month, 20% the following month. This article and others are estimating that 20% of the oil futures is now in these ETFs. That's a big fucking deal, because it means when USO rolls their contracts they will move the market bigly. \n\nHere's the situation. Currently the difference between June and July oil prices are about $7. This is essentially the measure of \"contango\" in the system. The thought being, as the world opens back up from COVID in July, oil will be more expensive due to more consumption. What they are failing to factor into the equation is USO. \n\nUSO rolls their contracts 1 week before the settlement date over a 4 day period. For June contacts, that will be around 5/12/2020. Remember, these are speculators, not people who actually want to use oil. That means, they will sell 20% of June oil futures and buy 20% of July oil futures (and some August). Guess what's going to happen to the price? June contracts will bottom out and July contracts will skyrocket. \n\nThe play: \nShort June contracts, long July contracts. There's also an options play, which i did. 5/14 puts ATM for June contracts , 6/19 (or whatever the date is) calls ATM for July contracts. \n\nYOU CANNOT FUCKING LOSE MONEY. You are essentially betting the contango situation is going to get worse, not better. If oil goes down, you're fine cuz one contract will offset the other. If oil goes up, you're fine for the same reason. The only way to lose money is if July contract prices get closer to June prices. As you, backwardation, or less contango. With USO positions being so large, it will only exacerbate contango. On top of the fact that the world is still pumping more oil than we can consume. On top of less storage as everything fills up. I dropped a shit ton of money on this.\n\nTL/DR: Short June contracts, long July contracts. There's also an options play, which i did. 5/14 puts ATM for June contracts , 6/19 (or whatever the date is) calls ATM for July contracts", "created_utc": 1587589124.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g69af1/oils_futures_arbitrage/", "is_self": true}
