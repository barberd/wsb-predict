There are over 10,000 unique parts and processes at Tesla, so making small improvements across the board has a giant cumulative impact.\n\nAt the same time, we must also continue to make our products subtly better in thousands of small ways.\n\nIt is important to bear in mind that we lost $700 million in the first quarter this year, which is over $200 million per month. Investors nonetheless were supportive of our efforts and agreed to give us $2.4 billion (our net proceeds) to show that we can be financially sustainable.\n\nThat is a lot of money, but actually only gives us approximately ten months at the first-quarter burn rate to achieve breakeven. It\u2019s vital that we respect the faith investors have shown in Tesla, but it will require great effort to do so.\n\nThat is why, going forward, all expenses of any kind anywhere in the world, including parts, salary, travel expenses, rent, literally every payment that leaves our bank account must be reviewed, confirmed as critical and the top of every page of outgoing payments signed by our CFO.\n\nI will personally review and sign every 10th page.\n\nPlease examine closely every expense where responsibility is, or probably should be, assigned to your group. If in doubt, assume it is on your plate, so that we don\u2019t have anything slip through the cracks.\n\nThis will take at least a few weeks to get right. Please don\u2019t worry if it isn\u2019t correct at first.\n\nThis is hardcore, but it is the only way for Tesla to become financially sustainable and succeed in our goal of helping make the world environmentally sustainable.\n\nThanks again for your excellent work,\n\nElon", "created_utc": 1558125672, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bpwg9n/tsla_time_to_tighten_the_old_belt/", "is_self": true}
