Grounding 737 has cost BA $9B and value continues to rise. As they are holding inventory on manufactured planes and lawsuits haven't all settled yet. They just took out another $4B in loans to help with liquidity. Estimated losses are $1B/month.\n2. Worst orders numbers and deliveries in who gives a fuck how long, its bad.\n3. Claimed they fixed the software error with an update, in their proposal error was still found. \n4. Airlines are extending cancellation on all 737 Max flights until July, looking like it's going to cost $BA at least another $6B.\n\nI picked up some 310/315 Puts for 1/31 if you're a true autist the 300 for 1/31 also looking mighty fine. \n\n(This is all my opinion and in no way financial advise, do what you will with this information.)\n\n# #BearGang", "created_utc": 1579559944, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/erl13w/ba_puts_bring_me_tendies/", "is_self": true}
