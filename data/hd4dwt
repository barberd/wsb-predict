In case you did not notice, share prices of Wirecard, a German company that processes digital payments, tanked last Thursday. In true autist fashion, many of us lost a lot of money. \nThe whole subreddit is now full of posts about Wirecard. It is a true dumpster fire. One fellow autist pointed out in this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/mauerstrassenwetten/comments/hd2wre/wirecard_hin_oder_her/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf , that we are in need of a new stock we can hype up until it goes bust. This is where you come in: share your DD so we can find new, truly autistic stonks to bet on. Everyone over here is so caught up in this Wirecard bullshit that no one is sharing new bets that could make us millions or make us go broke!!\nPS: We are also currently discussing whether or not we should go full Hertz mode and just double down...\n\nYours\nA (lucky) autist that lost less than $2,500 in Wirecard, so no position to share unfortunately", "created_utc": 1592733426.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hd4dwt/your_fellow_german_autists_need_your_help/", "is_self": true}
