Makes no sense and literally makes no money for the company.   \nBUT!  \nIt prints money for us. SPCE is not affected by the spread of the Virus and if some nice announcements tomorrow this stock can go above 50$! I dont think  Richard Branson is an idiot and wont use the opportunity to promote his stock even more!  \n\n\nIM ALL IN NOW.
