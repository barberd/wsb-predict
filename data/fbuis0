Fuck no, he will do anything and everything in the book, illegal or legal to save this ship. If he doesn\u2019t, he risks losing. I think he will emulate China in liquidating tons of cash in the market and downplaying the virus. I see a few Green Day\u2019s before the market inevitably corrects just like how it took a while for it to collapse this go round after China played dirty. This is the one time every powerful human agrees, fuck corona virus because it fucks with our ability to achieve our agenda. Media might just downplay it for a while to help out their billionaire buddies. Finally, the CDC has always talked about disease \u201cx\u201d. This is a disease that kills 80 mil people. Let\u2019s be honest, those numbers will be heavily skewed towards countries with bad infrastructure and bad healthcare. Essentially, poor countries will account for a vast majority of deaths, and old/compromised people will make up the rest. This is a correction due to every stock being over valued and at all time highs. Look at a 180 day candlestick chart, they all look the same, every company. All time highs, to massive drops to 180day to 1yr averages. I think the prices will drive buyers plus the realization that this won\u2019t truly effect us regardless if it hits max potential. Sorry this was so long I\u2019m fucking smacked boys.  And boys don\u2019t just buy calls or puts, if you have the capital sell a put, easy premium. Make the smart play, if you think it\u2019s gonna trend down, buy puts, up? Buy calls. Not sure? Spread. Have a tool bag of plays to use like a ducking plumber. The hammer don\u2019t work for everything, sometimes you need the wrench, or the screwdriver. As long as you diversify your plays to fit the situation, you can trade the same stock all the time. For example, I trust AMD and bought calls all year, then I waited and sold puts way otm for fat premium and cashed out. Meanwhile I bought puts and tenderized theta gang. Then Friday I thought it was all gonna go green, I went gainer my dd and bought $INTC calls expiring this Friday. Down like 50% on those contracts. Not only did it not go up, I bought it the second it was up when the cost was at its highest by a stupid amount. Played myself and hate my self for getting greedy. Pray for bull market Monday. \n\nTLDR: Buy cheap calls on shit like $TSLA, $AMZN, $AMD, $NVDA, $LULU, literally anything that is stupid cheap now. A lot of shit went green Friday and could be a song of upturn.", "created_utc": 1583071781, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fbuis0/sorry_homos_bulls_will_return_to_power_once_again/", "is_self": true}
