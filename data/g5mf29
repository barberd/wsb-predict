I am a bear overall, but that doesn't mean I am going to wave my pride flag and shout in peoples faces. I am here to make tendies after all. My point being, make sure you arenot just a bull or a bear. Instead be a human being that wants to make tendeez.\n\nFind your own strikes and premiums\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-Calls\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\\+DLTR, Dollar Tree sells small ticket items to poor people for a dollar. They sell masks and household goods that people just bought a shit ton off. And recession= more poor people = more spending at dollar tree.Also they just hired 25k people so thats a good sign. Place calls on them for late June.\n\n\\+ATVI, Activision owns the Call of duty Franchise, World of Warcraft, Overwatch, and a ton of other great video game titles. And studies I have read say that video games usage has gone up 60% since this started. Unlike Netflix, you can spend unlimited money on micro transactions in these games. COD MW, is officially the game of the year in copies sold. And warzone released a month and a half ago. It is at 50 million players. With their fortnite sales systemn they are making bank This is my top pick. I am extremely bullish for these 5 reasons, they have solid performance, everybody is playing video games, COD warzone is a tendee machine, google twitch and youtube trends show their gains, and e sports is growing exponentially. Buy a little OTM calls for 3-4 months out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\+Oil tankers, Nordic America, Scorpio, Teekay, Euronav. They are gonna report the best earnings reports ever due to literally being paid to take on oil. That they can sale later for more money. CANNOT GO TITS UP.
