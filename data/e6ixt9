{"id": "e6ixt9", "title": "BIIIB SHORT STRANGLE (if mods approve)", "selftext": "I\u2019m not sure if this trade will make it out to you autists due to mods being gays but here\u2019s a pretty decent play to collect some premium. The expected move to the downside on BIIB is about 10% and upside 5% according to Jefferies. Let\u2019s just take advantage of the fact a lot of the buyers here seem pretty autistic and do a strangle outside of this range.\n\nSell 335C\nSell 250P\n\nNow here\u2019s the neat part about this trade. Our break evens end up being 246 and 337 giving us a nice little cushion outside of the range. Why be a bull of a bear when you can be the drunk redneck sitting in the bed of his pickup truck shooting at both.\n\nSo long as it trades within that range post earnings you\u2019ll make money off the IV crush and you can close Friday. \n\nIs it risky?(or should I use my unlimited leverage?)\nWell our risk is undefined so we can only lose infinity. This is right within my personal risk tolerance so I\u2019m going to place the trade. \n\nWell that\u2019s all folks this is a /u/moderndaypatriot production and make sure you thank me for your tendies tomorrow.", "created_utc": 1575560712, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e6ixt9/biiib_short_strangle_if_mods_approve/", "is_self": true}
