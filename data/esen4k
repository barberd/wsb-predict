I have already noticed some astroturding like \"hey guise I just put my trade in questrade and made a tidy profit\" so I expect they are deep.\n\nThe thing is, these radio ads are painfully.. For lack of a better word, cringy. There's like 5 different ones from the edge investor teen, to the guy who 'can' spare 5 minutes to save 100k on fees (what the fuck), they just make me want to go into the void that is calling me and hit that ramp off the side of the highway at 100mph.\n\nPlease fix this, thanks.", "created_utc": 1579711846, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/esen4k/questrade_dd/", "is_self": true}
