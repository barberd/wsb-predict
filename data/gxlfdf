Market will crash with CLO debt later.", "selftext": "Link to Court Documents I got flagged with when I went to pay my broke ass bills- https://www.centurylink.com/asset/aboutus/downloads/legal/CTL%20MDL%20Bill%20Insert-N-20-064_JP.pdf\n\nI\u2019ll start off with saying if you file a claim if you\u2019ve been affected by CTL overcharges you might be able to get $2,500 for filing a claim. Info is in the link. File quick times almost up. \n\n      Why to short (TL;DR at bottom)- \n\n      \u201cA $15.5 million Settlement fund will pay (1) claims of eligible Settlement Class Members; (2) attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses; and (3) Service Payments to Settlement Class Representatives. CenturyLink has agreed to pay $3 million on top of the Settlement Fund to cover costs of Settlement administration and notice. If administration and notice costs are over $3 million, up to an additional $1 million will be paid for equally by CenturyLink and the Settlement Fund.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re already settled. This will happen as claims are made. With the crashing economy looming over us in the next few months or so, this is going to cut them pretty deep. \n\nWith the CDC official covid rates stating that **covid deaths can be counted without** a **POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE TEST** showing that the death rates are extremely inflated in USA-\n\n     \u201cCOVID-19 deaths are identified using a new ICD\u201310 code. When COVID-19 is reported as a cause of death \u2013 or when it is listed as a \u201cprobable\u201d or \u201cpresumed\u201d cause \u2014 the death is coded as U07.1. This can include cases with or without laboratory confirmation\u201d\n  \n     \u201c1Deaths with confirmed or presumed COVID-19, coded to ICD\u201310 code U07.1\n2Percent of expected deaths is the number of deaths for all causes for this week in 2020 compared to the average number across the same week in 2017\u20132019. Previous analyses of 2015\u20132016 provisional data completeness have found that completeness is lower in the first few weeks following the date of death (<25%), and then increases over time such that data are generally at least 75% complete within 8 weeks of when the death occurred (8).\n3Pneumonia death counts exclude pneumonia deaths involving influenza.\n4Influenza death counts include deaths with pneumonia or COVID-19 also listed as a cause of death.\n5Deaths with confirmed or presumed COVID-19, pneumonia, or influenza, coded to ICD\u201310 codes U07.1 or J09\u2013J18.9.\u201d \n\nSource: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm\n\nThis means we have extremely overinflated rates of covid deaths. A positive test is not required in the slightest. We are pumping death rates for media to take advantage of. \n\n\nThis is important because it shows COVID threat has been majorly over-inflated for the healthy population in general. There are many young healthy people who die from the flu compared to COVID. \n\nThis link shows the ACTUAL death rate of COVID is 0.4%. \n\nSource- https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html\n\n-The flu is 6.9%- [Edit: I quoted a week I saw from the article and CDC chart. The actual year to year rate is 2-3%] This awesome article links to the CDC for rates.  \n\nSource: https://www.contagionlive.com/news/us-flu-cases-reach-32-million-pediatric-hospitalization-rates-hit-record-high\n\nThink about the rates of infection on cruise ships for example. They were the perfect sample size as an isolated population. Look at infection rates and death rates versus the total population. I\u2019ve done the numbers before and you\u2019ll find it\u2019s very similar. \n\nThe economy will reopen with healthy people staying healthy. Those who are at risk should still be careful. After all the protests, people will find that many will be and stay healthy even after media suggests otherwise. \n\nWith people outside during the summer, internet usage will drop as people have been cooped up for too long during the pandemic. This is logical. \n\nInternet usage will be down due to that, and CTL will drop due to that, and the fat fuck lawsuit they\u2019re getting smacked with. \n\nIf you think that means the economy will stay up, I might do a fat Chad-chode DD on CLOs and why the economy is still gonna fucking tank hard due to corporate debt blown up just like the housing market in 2008. \n\n\nTL;DR- go long on anything outdoors, oil, and travel. Short CTL and tech like that. COVID is a little baby bitch for over 99% of people. \n\nCTL $6p 10/16\n\nYou\u2019re fucking welcome.", "created_utc": 1591422823.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gxlfdf/double_dds_cant_go_tits_up_covid_stats_on_why_the/", "is_self": true}
