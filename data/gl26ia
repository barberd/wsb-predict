{"id": "gl26ia", "title": "$DLTR - Dollar Tree Earnings Play", "selftext": "Earnings May 28th Pre-Market\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHi everyone, this is my first DD write up and hope it goes well. Past few weeks been playing both the run-up to earnings and the actual earnings themselves and have had some success (CHGG, NET, ATVI, PTON), and figured now would be a good time to share a DD I am confident with. Two companies I have had my eye on since pandemic started were Dollar Tree and Dollar General. [Saw a DD on $DG a few days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gj9jjg/dollar_general_analysis_of_operations_and_company/), and it makes total sense. TLDR: Dollar Stores are recession proof and actually do better during a recession.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are a few key takeaways as to why $DLTR will have a strong ER:\n\n* As unemployment continues to increase, the number of people who will be buying discount good will increase. Company will likely have strong outlook moving forward.\n* Dollar Tree and subsidiary Family Dollar have their strongest presences in suburban and urban areas respectively. Dollar General mostly operates in rural areas\n* As COVID has a stronger impact and is more widespread in urban and suburban areas, lockdowns will continue there longer and people will remain unemployed\n* Dollar Tree is now offering deliveries on their products for people who are afraid to go into the physical stores.\n\nFor the past three months, there is a noticeable difference in the stock performance of $DG and $DLTR. $DG is up 13% to a new ATH, while $DLTR is down 17%. The two companies offer similar business models with the same target markets, yet I feel $DLTR is significantly undervalued. \n\n* $DG has 15k stores with revenues of $25.6 billion, while $DLTR also has 15k stores with revenues of $22.8 billion\n* Despite nearly identical market shares and a slightly higher revenue, $DG has a market cap of $45.7 billion yet $DLTR only has a market cap of $17.8 billion\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR**: I think both $DG and $DLTR are good plays here that will have strong earnings and good guidance. Yet I feel $DLTR is significantly undervalued and will show tremendous short term and long term growth. Urban and suburban markets that $DLTR focuses on will have high unemployment for the foreseeable future leading to the need for cheap and discount products.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPositions: $DLTR 5/29 82.5c and 8/21 95c", "created_utc": 1589662466.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gl26ia/dltr_dollar_tree_earnings_play/", "is_self": true}
