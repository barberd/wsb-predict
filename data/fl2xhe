Just trying to save you assholes money on puts tendies come tax time http://imgur.com/gallery/QId0idv\n\nEdit 3: AND you can trade these babies like 24/7, Saturday and Sunday mornings excepted I know some of you like to trade the pre and post market moves", "created_utc": 1584587711.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fl2xhe/tax_advantage_of_options_on_futures_options_vs/", "is_self": true}
