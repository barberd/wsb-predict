No idea what I was doing I deposited $50 and bought a stonk and it went up. I came here to brag about my $2.13 gain on my first day! They told me good job young retart now buy calls like the rest of us. I deposited $150 more and bought a couple 2/21 $10 calls of INSG and figured 5G can't go tits up. It went up in the beginning. My pp was so hard and I showed my mom all my money I made. I became addicted on MLK day. I deposited $500 more and figured I'd buy more calls because sticks only go up. I wake up today. Everything has gone to shit. Thank you WallStreetBets.\n\nbut seriously are month out calls common to have ups and downs like this?", "created_utc": 1579802759, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eswufc/month_out_calls/", "is_self": true}
