Tesla posted 10 consecutive weekly gains and have risen 127% over that span. (CNBC)\n* China\u2019s National Health Commission said it confirmed 3,062 new coronavirus cases and 97 additional deaths, mostly in Hubei province.

Josh Hawley is proposing putting the Federal Trade Commission, an independent agency, within the Department of Justice, which is part of the executive branch.

(CNBC)\n* L Brands (LB) is nearing a deal to sell its Victoria\u2019s Secret brand to private equity firm Sycamore Partners in a deal that could be announced as soon this week.
