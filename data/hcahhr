{"id": "hcahhr", "title": "VERY - Very good food company", "selftext": "Went public two days ago, opened at .48 yesterday and today 1.40 close, cant find much in the way of financials on this company or what their financials look like other than they have 71m outstanding shares. \n\nBasically from what I understand they make meat substitutes and currently have a direct to buisness and consumer and also a subscription service. They have a second facility (factory) under construction in Vancouver. Other than beyond meat does anyone else know of another competitor? I think that there is room for the meat substitute compitition, especially with the rising costs of meat in canada, and not to mention the rise of veganism/vegetarianism. Has anyone else heard more about them? Or tried their products?\n\nFor those who are lazy.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/quote/VERY:CN", "created_utc": 1592606453.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hcahhr/very_very_good_food_company/", "is_self": true}
