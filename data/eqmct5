I am going to be the first to say it: the market is dead. \n\nThe beliefs, language, and analysis that we are relying on to describe what we are seeing are no longer meaningful. The success of the sheer nihilism on the subreddit is only heralding in a new age of chaos. When we are all upvoting statements like \u201cfuck you, let me get my tendies\u201d more so than some bullshit DD about greeks, trend lines, earnings, hand-jobs, because expletives are legitimately more insightful than graphs at this point - you know there is a problem. We need a new language to describe what we are seeing. \u201cMelt up\u201d? You know what that sounds like? Fucking CANCER.\n\nIn fact, I think cancer is about as good of a model to describe whatever stage we are entering into. The market has become unhinged from whatever larger organism/influence it was being sustained within and is devolving evolutionarily into an atavistic state of self-reproduction. Capturing market share with zero regard for sustainability on any fucking front (profit, environment, regulations) all the while the stock price fucking $$$: CANCER. Berkshire Hathaway rumors about opening up a position on B only to have one of their planes fall out of the sky 12 hours later?: CANCER. Bombs raining down, SPY going up? Cancer. Running on caloric debt, zero interest, no brains, all brawn, big boys fucking kids instead of hookers, spending more money on McDonald\u2019s than cocaine? CANCER. \n\nThe snake is not only eating its own tail \u2014 it\u2019s shitting out of it as well.\n\nRIP", "created_utc": 1579381622, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eqmct5/the_market_is_dead/", "is_self": true}
