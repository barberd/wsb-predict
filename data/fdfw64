Headed to Colorado with the wins to take more money from  $MCRI. All in $22.5 Put 3/20. I\u2019m not leaving without all the money. Now is your chance retards. \n\nIf they are allowing a brainlet like me to walk in with $100 and leave like this then business is doomed. All those chips exchanging hands with beer virus all over them. Crowded tables and as many slot machines as they can squeeze together. It\u2019s the perfect storm. \n\nSo what are you waiting for?
