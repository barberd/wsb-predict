We have another chance to moon: Rite Aid is our next tendie train. Yes, I\u2019m talking about the glorified liquor store that got fucked in the ass after the failed Walgreens merger a few years ago. \nBut things have changes. The old CEO John Standley who was a boomer douchebag that basically actively sabotaged the company and brought it from $180+ per share to penny stock status. But management had been changed with sexy CEO mommy Heyward Donigan two quarters ago and also a new COO. During Heyward\u2019s first quarter, the company was already showing that it was rebuilding strength. It\u2019s EPS improved and beat expected by 47.33%. Last quarter\u2019s ER, they beat the $0.15 expected EPS by 261.47% with $0.54 actual. The stock price surged from $7-8 a share to $23.88 in a week. However, profit-taking, gay bears and short ers took tanked it, but RAD found a new support level at around $12. \nListening to the last earnings call, the company has very good guidance. They are planning to expand their digital platforms and other services. From the ER call: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the benefit of Rite Care in our business, in our third quarter results, which reflect growth in ancillary immunization of more than 47%, which is outpacing the competition.\u201d Also, \u201cdigital sales have been growing over the past few quarters, with a 69% increase in Q3, driven by digital refills. They\u2019ve also released Rite Aid branded ice cream, which has been huge success.\nThere are going to a couple catalysts coming within the next month and a half. On March 16th, Rite Aid will be hosting an Analyst Day. During the conference call, they\u2019ve repeatedly refused to answer some questions with the reason that they are saving it for Analyst Day. Must be good news. Earnings is on April 9th, which I am expecting to be huge. The sell-off last quarter after the earnings rally was because people were not fully confident that RAD could deliver consistently. But this ER will be bigly for the company. The last few months, the stock was struggling to break the $13 resistance. Last Thursday, it smashed into $15 before falling back to $14. It\u2019s about to smash through $15 again today. RAD to $30 as soon as it gets moving.", "created_utc": 1582060866, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f5z0jb/rad_is_your_next_ticket_to_space/", "is_self": true}
