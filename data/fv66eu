This coupled with some intense psychedelic experience has led to some intense conspiracy conversation with my imaginary friend. One thing that people have missed (or seem to have missed) is the illicit drug money. \n\nWhile Jerome says the money-printing presses are fired up. I am not sure if that is enough to keep the financial system afloat. So, I was going over the 2008 crisis to see how we got our shit together and saw an article from a UN advisor regarding drug money.\n\n\"Antonio Maria Costa, head of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime said he has seen evidence that the proceeds of organized crime were \"the only liquid investment capital\" available to some banks on the brink of collapse last year. He said that a majority of the $352bn (\u00a3216bn) of drug profits were absorbed into the economic system as a result.\"  \n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/global/2009/dec/13/drug-money-banks-saved-un-cfief-claims\n\nWhile the \"reported\" $352 bn (probably a lot more) might be not much but it should have helped a little. Still, I am sure, one way or another, drug cartels are/will involve in the current scenario. Let's not go into more detail with this narcos stuffs. \n\nAs the economic damage from coronavirus pandemic piles up, cities, states, and countries will face massive revenue loss. So, authorities will be looking for places/areas to juice up revenue in a legal way as much as possible. One of the areas definitely will be cannabis, as it could be relatively straightforward, given the infrastructure already in place. So, I am starting to see some articles pop up regarding further cannabis legalization.\n\nTLDR: The shadow economy is much bigger than people imagine. The legal way to get into the business is through cannabis. So, long weed.\n\nleap ACB 2021 $1 call (for poor autists), or TLRY OR APHA (for others)", "created_utc": 1586053294.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fv66eu/did_drug_cartels_save_the_2008_global_financial/", "is_self": true}
