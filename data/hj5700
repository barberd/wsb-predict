{"id": "hj5700", "title": "GPAQ \u2013 The SPAC that could be the next DKNG and NKLA", "selftext": "Tl;Dr: GPAQ seems to have high meme potential and there could be a huge pump in Sep when nfl season starts + the 100-year celebration. All in on GPAQ/GPAQW as you would get free 1.42 shares if you hold through the merge which was already passed on 6/30, so zero risk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I\u2019m trying to think which SPAC could be the next meme like DKNG and NKLA and I begin to GPAQ could be the next meme game. Also, since the merger has already been passed, your warrants won't go to zero.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBackground: The sports industry is very lucrative, and the largest 4 sports leagues revenue is around 32 Bn a year in 2015 and the NFL makes around 13 Bn which is the largest (see Investor Presentation /IP P.8). If you try to invest in the sports industry is unlikely that you could directly invest in the teams/leagues and you could only invest indirectly onto sports equipment producers such as Nike, Underarmour, etc.\n\nBut now, The NFL, the largest moneymaker in the sports league are giving us a direct way to invest in their facilities which is the Hall of Fame Village.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGPAQ would be an ultra-low float stock: When DKNG and NKLA starts to trade DKNG has 13% public float or 43 mil tradable while nkla is 5.7% or 23 mil tradable.\n\nGPAQ, on the other hand, would have around 8.6% public but only 2.6 mil tradeable float, the Sponsor would retain 2.0 mil or 6.6% float, but they would not be able to enter the market for at least 170 days.  HOFV would retain around 85% float when it starts to trade since they already put 250 mil into building the stadium and a few football fields which is phase 1(IP p. 26).\n\nThe crazy low public float means that is is much easier to pump GPAQ to the moon, GPAQ valuation is also way lower then dkng and nkla which is currently around 400 mil compare to NKLA 20 Bn and DKNG 11 Bn market cap., making HOFV much easier to be pumped by sports fans and FOMO especially when the Centennial celebration would be happening in HOFV.\n\nPump opportunities:\n\n1. The Investor Presentation doesn\u2019t show the estimates revenue for Fantasy sports, e gaming and sports betting (p.4), if Ohio could legalize sports betting in Aug or Sep it would send HOFV up more and potential betting cooperation with Caesars Entertainment or even plans to build a sports casino on HOFV would be very positive news\n2. The NFL 100th anniversary Centennial celebration in sep would be held at HOFV, this would be a 3 day promotion and there should loads of people to watch the TV about it. Meaning that NFL would be giving out a free 3-day ad promo video about the village. This would be a great opportunity for HOFV and the NFL to hype their own village and tell their fans to dump money into HOFV, so I would most likely hold it till then.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are some unique benefits in investing into GPAQ:\n\n1. This should be the first SPAC that I have seen with Tax deferral of capital gains benefits, and reduction in capital gains tax if you hold for 5 years (IP p.28). This may lead to some people who are short term traders become a long term buy and hold investor=further lower stock float\n2. GPAQ and GPAQW holders now could gain 1.42 new shares/share purchase rights when the merger is completed (IP p.4). Again, I never see this on other SPACs yet, I don\u2019t know how it will affect warrants/stonk holders but it should allow GPAQW holders to buy 1.42 shares @ 11.5 with redemption @ 18.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRisks:\n\n1. Stonks going down- Stonks only go up you retard, but even if there is a long dip you could hold for a while ,those warrants won\u2019t expire for like 5 years until it hits 18, so you have high gain potential and a long time to wait if it go tits up. Besides, the HOFV would already finish phase 2 or even 3 and the NFL should make up something in those 5 years, so your stonks/warrants are safe.\n2. Founders has 6.6% float- but they would not be able to sell for at least 150 days - 1 year, if you afraid those founders will pull out a Branson style SPCE dump you should be fine, at least in 2020.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAppendix:\n\nInvestor presentation, IP:\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1708176/000121390020013714/ea122496ex99-1\\_gordonpointe.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1708176/000121390020013714/ea122496ex99-1_gordonpointe.htm)\n\nCentennial celebration:\n\n[https://www.profootballhof.com/events/nfl-centennial-celebration/](https://www.profootballhof.com/events/nfl-centennial-celebration/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDisclaimer: I may or may not be a retard but I\u2019m definitely an autist, I have never watched a single NFL sports match or liked sports at all, never been to the land of the free and I heard canton is a dump.\n\nI'm also a former gay bear/tanker gang member and has warrants @ 2.05 in GPAQW\n\nDo you own further DD if necessary", "created_utc": 1593586006.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hj5700/gpaq_the_spac_that_could_be_the_next_dkng_and_nkla/", "is_self": true}
