However, some weird news started to circulate a few weeks back - Microsoft has revealed the new Xbox but Sony has NOT revealed the new PlayStation. Why is this important?\n\n- Game and Network services make up approximately 17% of Sony\u2019s business model.\n- The new PlayStation is advertised as being available holiday 2020\n- Nobody knows what the final product even *looks* like. Dev kits were sent out, but it\u2019s not the final hardware (illustrated by patents taken out by Sony).\n- *Fun but relevant fact*: consoles are sold at a LOSS to the parent company - they sell gaming consoles under market value to encourage console sales, and then make the money back off a percentage from each game\u2019s individual sale. (This started nearly 10 years ago, with the PlayStation 3 being the first to do so).\n- PlayStation Experience (PSX) was not held last year, despite it\u2019s multi-year long track record. This is a convention where Sony showcases its gaming developments and future titles. One is not planned for this year either.\n- https://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2018/05/23/sony-says-that-the-next-playstation-is-three-years-away/#329701fe621b\nThis article from Forbes in May, 2018 cites an interview from Sony Entertainment\u2019s CEO in which he states that the next console will take at least \u201c3 years\u201d. That put the timeline for completion in Summer of NEXT YEAR.\n- The PlayStation 5 has a webpage, but it is strangely almost blank. It\u2019s been registered for a long time now.\n\nWith all of those things taken into consideration, I don\u2019t think PlayStation is going to release their next console by the holiday season. There is a crazy lack of transparency, a drought of information, and the timelines proposed by the company also don\u2019t align. I think Sony has multiple issues on top of not being able to provide a console that would boost 17% of their company\u2019s infrastructure if they can\u2019t meet deadlines. Their hesitancy to release a new console (and sell it at a loss) also tells me that they might not be as financially secure as we\u2019re led on to believe. Microsoft is absorbing the competition while Sony waits, and nobody has any idea when they would even announce the PS5 because Sony does not attend E3 (an entertainment expo that houses other big companies like Microsoft and Ubisoft) anymore. \n\nI bet Sony has bigger issues than they\u2019re letting on, and the management of their entertainment sector validates those concerns. 9/10 analysts rank Song as a \u201cbuy\u201d, which also leads me to believe that they\u2019re way overvalued given their performance. I\u2019m placing some long puts on Sony far-er OTM. I\u2019m gonna YOLO some earnings and pray I\u2019m autistic enough to be right. If news breaks that there won\u2019t be a PS5 in time for XBox\u2019s launch, Sony will take a massive hit. And Sony has to release the news soon because they\u2019re already months behind.\n\n\nTL;dr - $SNE, 6/19 or later, puts @ $(far-er OTM / around $45). *This is high risk, high reward. Please practice risk management and don\u2019t blow money you aren\u2019t comfortable losing!* Sell if news hits that Sony did an oopsie", "created_utc": 1583768131, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffwgve/sne_more_like/", "is_self": true}
