{"id": "fm4jv2", "title": "For anybody that followed ULTA today. Here is some DD on ULTA Beauty and some info from their conference calls/earnings reports.", "selftext": "Yesterday someone posted on how ULTA was a good short going into a possible recession, so I decided to dig deeper. \n\nIn spring 2019 ULTA reached a 52-week high of $368.83.. going into this February 21 and the first day of the beginning of the downtrend ULTA was sitting at $300 per share. After today's close it is now at $148. Is there more to squeeze to the downside on this one? I'm not sure, but my opinion is yes. \n\nLet's compare ULTA now to the 2008/2009 financial crisis. Keep in mind, ULTA has very strong brand loyalty and also has rights to the Kylie Jenner line, which they didn't have back in 2008. From peak to trough during the financial crisis ULTA went from $15 to $4.50, a 70% drop. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i657f6azpwn41.png?width=2054&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef6e6ab1fa20dfcc1149bc508475219d136a0c83\n\n*ULTA during 2008/2009 crisis.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom peak to trough during the current corona virus crisis, ULTA has gone from $300 to $148 what it closed at today. Let's say a 50% drop, already pretty hefty! \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eje4umn0qwn41.png?width=2058&format=png&auto=webp&s=355620a72002a61b7d190fa6ce02b6e4b455dca8\n\n*ULTA during Corona Virus Feb/Mar chart.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat makes me think there might be more to squeeze? Well I went through there financial reports and it looks like during all of fiscal year 2019 they spent almost ALL of their profits re-purchasing stock (at all time highs). Take a look at this, from there earnings release. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u3sxitq1qwn41.png?width=1766&format=png&auto=webp&s=cca8eb9fc15938405a3c3ffbf22b269a445b7f4b\n\n*ULTA outlook 2020 from financial report.*\n\nNot only that, but the board had approved a new share authorization program of up to 1.6 billion. This is including the share re-purchase program already in place of $875 million re-purchase program initiated in 2019. ULTA's new re-purchase program will be a total of $725 million for fiscal year 2020. To put this into perspective, in 2019 ULTA did $7.21 billion in sales at an approximate profit margin of 10% for a total profit of $594 million. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sz0kdr39qwn41.png?width=1746&format=png&auto=webp&s=36b01eb769fc1259a45fb1c916ceffa49de79480\n\n*ULTA's announcement of adjusted re-purchase program for 2020.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, something interesting happened to ULTA stock today March 20th. The stock opened up about +8% and remained there for most of the day. Until the final 10 minutes of trading hours it was sitting at +10% for the day. At 3:54pm there was a huge sell-off. Look at the volume of the sell-off compared to the volume for the entire day. Long red candles that were held up with some big buying power just to keep it afloat. What are my thoughts on this? It is my opinion that a big fish sold off a significant position of the stock, which was then propped up by market makers to keep the stock afloat. It ended up closing up only 0.71% for the day. Please note this is only speculation and my opinion. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mqv15w2aqwn41.png?width=2052&format=png&auto=webp&s=69544046e807f1e4e0d969f4edc67d573f66953a\n\n*ULTA's daily chart from today Mar 20, 2020.*\n\n**Disclaimer:** I have a short position on the stock. \n\n### Summary\n\n**1.** ULTA has fairly strong balance sheet (with not much debt) sitting at $208 million cash or roughly 2.47% of the value of their market cap.  \n**2.** ULTA has strong brand loyalty, including Kylie Jenner's line of cosmetics.  \n**3.** However, if recession is looming cosmetics generally don't fare well during these times.  \n**4.** In 2019 they spent nearly all their free cash flow after running operations and expansions on the re-purchase of stock.  \n**5.** In 2019 they did $660 million worth of share re-purchases and logged $594 million revenue for the year.  \n**6.** In 2020 they announced they've increased the buy-back program from $875 million to $1.6 billion, an increase of $725 million.  \n**7.** In their March 2020 conference call they also stated that there current numbers have NOT taken any of the CoronaVirus factors into effect.  \n**8.** In 2008 their stock crashed nearly 70% from peak to trough.  \n**9.** Currently in 2020 during corona virus outbreak, they have had a 50% decline in stock price.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; they literally spent most of their money on share buy-backs last year when the stock was at ATH and this thing still has room to drop.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDISCLAIMER: NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE.
