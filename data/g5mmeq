Going to be very tough for this to go higher than $700. It's gone straight up from $450s to $770s. I think it goes lower or stays below $700 because:\n\n* Oil prices at historic lows, less reason to buy electric vehicle\n* Less people buying luxury cars (even Model 3 is $50k or more with decent options)\n* Economy hurting / potential depression / loss of jobs = less buyers of 50-100k cars.\n\nSee chart :\n\n\\- Gap fill downside is $650. Breaks below that, we're at $600 from previous resistance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My play:**\n\nUse the vertical bull call spread to take advantage of high IV and limit risk. high probability of success and great risk/reward ratio.\n\nSell 5 contracts of a Bull Call Spread for May 15 710/700 , pays you $5.85 net credit.  \n(Buy 710 call, Sell 700 call).\n\nVery good risk/reward considering TESLA can still go UP from today's stock price of $687 and you still make money. You would just need TSLA to stay under $700 to make money.\n\n**TLDR:** Sell Bull Call spread on TSLA to take advantage of high IV (or most of you retards can just buy puts)", "created_utc": 1587499755.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5mmeq/tsla_hard_to_see_it_going_up_over_700_from_here/", "is_self": true}
