Congrats you played yourself. \n\nTLDR of that post: Im super secret messanger, China just opened factories it takes 2 months for US to open factories hur dur \n\nThat post is just like todays market, fake bullshit but still rising.  \n\nMajority of stuff is assembled in Guangzhou region where all the main factories are. Those were open since late february. China opened all factories in march ([Even Wuhan](https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202003180011)). First week was tough as factory suppliers had problem finding workers but now its all done and dusted.\n\nFun fact about factories in China, lot of B class factories have trouble finding workers after chinese new year every year. Due to Chinese policy of everything having at the same region lot of chinese people relocated from different provinces to work in factory and go back for chinese new year. Problem with that is, lot of people do not come back to work. One of our supplier has this problem,for couple months after CNY their factory works on 50% capacity because 30% of workforce simply does not show up to work after CNY. \n\n**But now China is back to \"normal\". If we can call it that.** \n\nFrom my friends and suppliers that I work with around China I have this info.   \n\n* People are out and about going to work using public transportation\n* People do not shop, at all. Streets are full but shops are struggling. (governments have events encouraging people to shop but not sure how succesful that is)\n* Lot of shops still closed (probably forever), the ones that are open are open chaotically, weird hours, some do not let customers in, only thru window. Some act like there was no virus\n* People are jumpy af when there is new case in the city, even in Beijing, city of 20mil. One case can halt part of city. \n* Travel is still dead in major cities\n\nPoints above is future reality for USA. The only difference might be spending money as americans love that shit. Chinese are indebt and have no means to pay for anything with their priorities of baby / house / car in that order. \n\nOutside of that you cannot compare China and USA. They are living in two different worlds and their recovery will not be the same.\n\n**Chinese GDP is all fake.**\n \nQuickly explain the GDP in China. We all know GDP is measurement of the output, and its pretty flawed one. But at least western countries pretend to follow. China on other hand. Their GDP is useless. It does not say anything about economy. CCP in all their wisdom in 2010 decided that they want to double the GDP by 2020. So what happens in communist dictatorships? Chinese provinces get GDP targets. Problem is that a lot of provinces are scared shitless of CCP so they outperform the GDP target and doubling it every year so CCP is not mad at them. How they do it? By building bridges going nowhere, by building cities where no one lives. By building roads that break in 2 years so they can repair them again. Pressure is intense. To summarize, Chinese GDP is measurement of government input into the economy not output of the economy. \n\nMiddle class and poor people are struggling. Have multiple people who confirmed to me that all their friends started to sell their clothes they hoarded during good times to raise money which suggest squeeze on middle class. \n\t\nSo what is China planning on doing? They gonna pump that GDP to the MOOOOOOOON as they are buying record number of construction equipment \n\nhttps://www.khl.com/international-construction/record-excavator-sales-in-china/143411.article\n\nLeaving poor people and middle class trapped in debt. They are building whole economy on debt and are going the same way as Japan. (future stagnation for 10-20-40 years)\n\nUSA on other hand can maybe thank their infrastructure weeks that did nothing for decades as they can use the recession and start pumping money into crumbling inrastructure that needs update which should provide healthy GDP, work for poor people and ease the burden. But still, wont be V recovery, points I mentioned above will still happen in USA.", "created_utc": 1588159611.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ga7plc/what_is_happening_in_china_and_why_the_us_economy/", "is_self": true}
