LITERALLY BAT SHIT CRAZY...\n\nFROM NY TIMES:\n\nA second cultural factor behind the epidemic are traditional Chinese beliefs about the powers of certain foods, which have encouraged some hazardous habits. There is, in particular, the aspect of Chinese eating culture known as \u201cjinbu,\u201d (\u9032\u88dc) meaning, roughly, to fill the void. Some of its practices are folklorish or esoteric, but even among Chinese people who don\u2019t follow them, the concept is pervasive.  \n\n\nIt is better to cure a disease with food than medicine, so starts the holistic theory. Illnesses result when the body is depleted of blood and energy \u2014 though not the kind of blood and energy studied in biology and physics, but a mystic version.  \n\n\nFor men, it is most important to fill the energy void, which is related to virility and sexual prowess; for women, the stress is on replacing blood, which improves beauty and fertility. Rare plants and animals from the wild are thought to bring the best replenishment, especially when eaten fresh or raw. Winter is said to be the season when the body needs more \u201cjinbu\u201d foods. (Could that help explain why both SARS and the current epidemic broke out during that time of year?)  \n\n\nHard-core believers in \u201cjinbu\u201d seem to buy into this notion, too: \u201cLike-shapes eaten strengthen like-shapes\u201d (\u4ee5\u5f62\u88dc\u5f62), with the word \u201cshapes\u201d sometimes referring to human organs and their functions. Adherents count as favorites a long list of exotic foods \u2014 whose methods of procurement or preparation can be outright cruel, with some simply too revolting to describe here.  \n\n\nI\u2019ve seen snakes and the penises of bulls or horses \u2014 great for men, the theory goes \u2014 on offer at restaurants in many cities in southern China. Bats, which are thought to be the original source of both the current coronavirus and the SARS virus, are said to be good for restoring eyesight \u2014 especially the animals\u2019 granular feces, called \u201csands of nocturnal shine\u201d (\u591c\u660e\u7802). Gallbladders and bile harvested from live bears are good for treating jaundice; tiger bone is for erections.  \n\n\nMore mundane yet no less popular is the palm civet (\u679c\u5b50\u72f8), a small, wild quadruped suspected of having passed on the SARS virus to humans. When stewed with snake meat, it is said to cure insomnia.  \n\n\nLess wealthy people might turn to dog meat \u2014 preferably a dog that has been chased around before being slaughtered, because some people believe that more \u201cjinbu\u201d benefits are reaped from eating an animal whose blood and energy ran high. Similarly, it is thought that animals killed just before serving are more \u201cjinbu\u201d potent, which is one reason the more exotic offerings in wet markets tend to be sold alive \u2014 also making them more potent vectors for any virus they might carry.", "created_utc": 1582748823, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9zme6/thanks_china_you_bat_feces_eating_pieces_of_shit/", "is_self": true}
