Not just the official gas pedal either \u2014 repo and buying corporate debt in the short term \u2014 but the unofficial one: having Blackrock and Goldman et al gap us up in futures ever night, aggressively dip buy when things drop too fast, etc. \n\nI was doubtful but now it seems clear: JPow really don\u2019t give a fuck and is going to work to get us to ATHs and then who knows. Dollar index be damned, yield curve be damned, balance sheets, \u2014 whatever. If the markets aren\u2019t proceeding at a brisk pace upward then obviously they\u2019re not functioning correctly, and markets not functioning correctly requires swift and extensive Fed action. \n\nOk.\n\nSo then why does he still tell the truth about stuff in his public appearances? I understand as chairman he needs congress to act to actually spend money directly on the country, and therefore he needs to accentuate the grimmer parts of the path forward right now.... but still. Since he seems ready to do anything to stop any major correction \u2014 why not just sound like a slightly less ridiculous Larry Kudlow? \n\nI\u2019m usually pretty good at this but JPow is a hard guy to get a read on", "created_utc": 1592527329.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hbqoy8/jerome_is_a_bit_weird_aint_he/", "is_self": true}
