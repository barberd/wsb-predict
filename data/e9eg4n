{"id": "e9eg4n", "title": "Long Strangle/Straddle strategy", "selftext": "I have mostly just played ERs and BTFD with calls and done pretty good. Up 120% since I started a few months ago. I am almost all cash now (except for some DIS $160 2021 calls) and I won't really have time to actively flip in the next few months because of work/family shit. \n\nI'm thinking I want to set up a long straddle on something (SPY?) for Dec 2020. Between the trade war and the election, there will be a day when SPY either goes up a bunch or drops a bunch and presents an exit for me with a nice profit without having to watch the market everyday. Based on today's prices, it would cost me about $4K to get into this position leaving about $1K to keep cash for YOLO opportunities.\n\nI know it's not a sexy play but what do you think? Should I pick a ticker with more volatility than SPY? Is this just retarded?", "created_utc": 1576103644, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e9eg4n/long_stranglestraddle_strategy/", "is_self": true}
