What did we ever do to y'all? Da fuq?\n\n\"In a dingy corner of the internet is a message board, soaked in profanity, bro-speak, and greed\"\n\nBitch our corner ain't dingy. Our corner is made of gold and barrels of oil motherfucker!\n\n\"It\u2019s frequently both juvenile and objectionable\"\n\nBitch who you callin juvenile??  We grown ass men out here, we pay capital gains tax and we literally keep the chicken tender industry afloat you SHITHEAD!\n\n\"Members of r/WSB believe they\u2019ve discovered a kind of perpetual motion machine in the interplay of stocks with options contracts, which offer a cheap way to bet on whether shares will rise or fall without buying the stock itself.\"\n\nWe don't believe that we've discovered it, we HAVE discovered it you dickhole. All of me and my WSB niggas own yachts fam. \n\n\"Members are aware that questionable thinking underpins their bets, to the point of self-deprecation. After user SolTrainRnsOnHolGran wondered whether r/WSB\u2019s activities might constitute insider trading, a user named recentlyunearthed replied, \u201cHow can we have insider knowledge when we don\u2019t have any knowledge?\u201d\"\n\nDamn right. We stupid. This shit wasn't planned. We just a community of assholes that came together and now we're on center stage. You got us all wrong man. Get to know us better before you go dissing us in front of millions of readers.", "created_utc": 1582834492, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fai4f1/message_to_bloomberg/", "is_self": true}
