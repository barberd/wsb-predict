The last 3 weeks the market has dropped severely Monday, and then gone slightly down by Friday. If this Monday dips huge then I\u2019ll sell more AMD puts EOD Monday, thinking $28-30 strike. I will continue to play earnings all week and I\u2019ll also be selling covered calls on the USO shares I was assigned. \n\nLet me know what you\u2019re selling this week.\n\n\nOverall total was $3800, which include the -$1150 from being assigned the USO shares. \nhttps://i.imgur.com/TcTBGGi.png \nhttps://i.imgur.com/S2VqmOB.png \nhttps://i.imgur.com/JvwGfps.png \nhttps://i.imgur.com/v4xkzI4.png \n\n\nFun fact: when you buy options and the market halts its shows they\u2019re worth $.01, when you sell them they show this monstrosity. \nhttps://i.imgur.com/iyJnATB.jpg", "created_utc": 1584885764.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fn0emt/weekly_theta_gang_thread/", "is_self": true}
