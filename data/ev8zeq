Do something about it \u2014 unless you\u2019re a bear. The karma for your next-level retardation put purchases will bite you in the ass. If you want to fuck me up over an extra comma, go for it.\n\nBut after your options expire with your idiot dream of a strike price, you won\u2019t be able to afford the goddamn plane ticket to reach me even from SPIRIT FUCKING AIRLINES.\n\nI\u2019m new to options. I don\u2019t have the liquidity to purchase actual stock because I\u2019m not the entitled son of a billionaire. I\u2019m also a broke college student. Fucking trust-fund-creature-ass dickwads.\n\nI\u2019m looking to make a billion a week with 3k to lose. Where\u2019s the best place to learn how to strictly trade calls &amp; puts? &amp; where\u2019s the best place to learn more about all the tentacles created through the call &amp; put options?\n\nThanks you fucking delinquents.
