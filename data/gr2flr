Overall, we are viewing the situation as temporary in nature, and we are aggressively navigating the challenges.\u201d The company expects to see an impact from coronavirus in fiscal second-quarter results, Lores said.\n\nThis was on 2/24 for HPQ.\n\nWe all know, US shit hit the fan in March. Logistics, downhill. MFG, downhill. Laptop sales? Probably record breaking.\n\nThat's the key. Quarterly revenue will probably spike. Both these companies' biggest segments are client solutions. $11.8B for Dell and $9.89B for HP last fiscal quarter. Both probably went up this current quarter for COVID-laptop purchases.\n\nI'm an enterprise IT manager in a 5000+ endpoint environment. We deployed a record smashing 2000 laptops in the month of March. 3 months of work in like 2 weeks, shit was crazy.\n\nWhat's that mean for the future? \n\nI don't have to buy new hardware for 4 years. We run off 4-year warranties. I'll only be buying adhoc computers for new staff, but otherwise my budget is fucked next fiscal year.\n\nGuessing any other competent enterprise IT team had similar situations to mine based on skimming r/sysadmin. \n\nYou heard it here first. I shorted TTWO before earnings and got called a retard. Look at that stock's position today.\n\nPuts are cheap as shit right now due to today's spike.\n\nHPQ $17/p  5/29, reporting 5/27\n\nHPQ $14.5/p 5/29, (because they're 4 cents each)\n\nDell $40/p 6/19, reporting 5/28", "created_utc": 1590517200.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gr2flr/warningdd_for_hpqdell_er_players/", "is_self": true}
