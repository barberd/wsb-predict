DD", "selftext": "heres my DD\n\nMFA is one of the longest standing reits in our economy their track record has traded between 6-8 dollars  for years on years and never missed a dividend until this covid thing as all reits have BUT looking at the balance sheet mfa currenty has more equity  in assets then outstanding loans  in theory real easte would need to flash crash like 25% for them to even consider going bankrupt but that wont happen, with the fed lowering interest rates for the next two years its going to save reits money as they will pay far less interest to buy property's and wish people going back to the the last thing they wanna do during riots and a pandemic is get evicted people will prioritize paying their rent to stay off the streets that arent safe AND with these riots people have looted so much money they can cover their rents for months no problem mfa is likly to not only bring back their dividend but also return to pre covid stock prices AND we still have the possibility of the fed bringing rates to 0 or negative even though they said they wont go negative if they did reits would hit the fucking moon as they would get paid just to buy properties ALSO now is the time to get in as not only are earnings on Tuesday BUT the fed is also going to be pumping the market Tuesday in other words you will not see mfa under 3 dollars ever again ever Tuesday its going to fucking MOON\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntdlr BUY MFA STOCK BEFORE TUESDAY BECAUSE IT WILL MOON AND HOLD NEVER SELL AND COLLECT A NICE DIVIDEND AS A BONUS .", "created_utc": 1592080380.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h8f7ve/mfa_is_about_to_mooooon_buy_this_reit_now_dd/", "is_self": true}
