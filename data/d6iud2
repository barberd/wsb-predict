{"id": "d6iud2", "title": "EA getting near put territory again?", "selftext": "Always gets 99-101 then drops. Sometimes huge drop. Sometimes just to 97 or so. I expect the drop to only be to about 97, but that's good enough. I bought some puts just now (100 put), only 10, leaving room to average up. I think it could rise another day or two, but should hit about 101-102 then drop, so that'll be my average up point. Also keep in mind. The drop might just be a quick right after market opens drop that it recovers from, so be ready to sell fast tomorrow morning for easy tendies.", "created_utc": 1568920668, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d6iud2/ea_getting_near_put_territory_again/", "is_self": true}
