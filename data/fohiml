Now I know some of you have been beaten down lately wondering why your puts aren\u2019t printing when we\u2019re literally all stuck inside jerking off I mean working from home/laid off with the apocalypse happening right outside. Yes, IV crush is a bitch. But it\u2019s also likely you didn\u2019t buy in at the opportune moment. That\u2019s why I leave you with this incredible technical analysis that works 100% of the time.\n\nSince the start of this crash (we\u2019ll say 2/24, we\u2019re one month in!) you\u2019ll see that every time we\u2019ve had a day of gains, the next day has been a day of losses. So literally, if you buy puts right before close on a day of gains, and hold those puts to close the next day, you will be raking in the tendies as long as IV isn\u2019t equally as gay as the day\u2019s losses combined with theta fuck. That\u2019s all, there\u2019s literally nothing else to it. Buy the reverse dip, if you didn\u2019t buy the reverse dip today, it\u2019s too late, play again next time.\n\nBrought to you by the Gay Bear corporation, member FDICk\n\n[Literally can\u2019t go tits up](https://i.imgur.com/hVtXyBd_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium)", "created_utc": 1585099380.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fohiml/ta_upsies_and_downsies_buy_the_reverse_dip_phaggot/", "is_self": true}
