Try one more time and it says I already have an open order.  Check orders and it executed twice giving my -10 qty contracts and from what I can tell opening a short position.  Tried buy to close the short position and now I have an open long and open short. \n\nCalled Ally and they have 2 hr wait time.  She says we are having issues with our trades I'll transfer you to a trader.  Still waiting 3 hrs later.  How fucked am I? How fucked is Ally?\n\nEdit:  They gave me some BS excuse that had to do with them accidentally using EOD pricing that was causing trade errors.  They will issue a trade correction and refund any losses that accrue from the error.  We will see.", "created_utc": 1585071655.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fo9c48/ally_is_fcked/", "is_self": true}
