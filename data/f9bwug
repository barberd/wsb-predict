{"id": "f9bwug", "title": "CTST 2021/2022 call?", "selftext": "New to WSB and options in general, but had a thought/question\n\nCTST has their license revoked (growing in unsanctioned rooms) and is currently trading at ~0.80. They have submitted for reinstatement of their license (no guarantee this will happen) and it usually takes a few months for a decision\n\nHowever, the company has appointed a CEO, and had self imposed many penalties along with the suggested remediation of the govt\n\nCurrent calls for 1/2021 and 1/2022 are 0.25-0.30 each. If they do get their license back, the previous trading high was $10 per share\n\nI only bought one call for 1/2021 and 1/2022, but seems like it would be a winner of license reinstated within the next 1-2 years?\n\nThoughts?", "created_utc": 1582644590, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9bwug/ctst_20212022_call/", "is_self": true}
