{"id": "d62kk6", "title": "Buy the dip", "selftext": "ROKU on sale ladies and gentlemen. Looking at the Xfinity flex box... Its a joke. A streaming box that you can get one for free if you use comcasts internet service. If you want any more you have to pay a monthly fee. Even then they are looking to launch a streaming service which would make no sense for them to offer their competitions services on this box. They will definitely restrict services. ROKU has a streaming channel that they are testing, that is free. All in all ROKU is the much better hardware, software, and business model. Offer the services for free and base your business on ads the way ROKU does, then give the options to pay to remove them. Comcast will always be the money hungry corporation. Without getting to much into it, I'll let you all do research on your own. But for those of you who need swayed or just want a stock to buy. ROKU. ROKU. ROKU. It is by far the best software too. Price camparisons and the search feature is amazing (as a consumer myself). Something to consider. Good luck investing.\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: I dont have any shares in ROKU. I did, but sold for a profit. If I had the money I would absolutely be back in. I will live vicariously through any of you who are or get in.", "created_utc": 1568833809, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d62kk6/buy_the_dip/", "is_self": true}
