{"id": "cz5stu", "title": "[Serious] Right now is the perfect time to short anything you can get your hands on in Argentina", "selftext": "The Argentine stock market just bounced 6.5% on news of capital flight controls coming into effect. This bounce is almost completely guaranteed to melt off and then some in the next few days. Argentina will default on its IMF loans and as the 27 October election draws near you will see the country bleed out money. They put a finger in the crack in the dam but guaranteed that 10 more cracks will start spewing water.\n\nCapital flight controls are supposed to allow the government more time to service its debt but the ability for the government to ever pay back what they owe is long gone.\n\nA good summary of why this won't work: \"Capital Economics, argued that not only did the previous round of\u00a0controls from 2011 to 2015 fail to stem the bleeding in FX reserves, they ultimately led to a balance of payments and currency crisis. Because the authorities limited the fall in the nominal exchange rate, even against a backdrop of 15 to 20 per cent inflation, the peso became substantially overvalued. That sowed the seeds for a huge devaluation in December 2015 and further sharp falls last year and this year.\"\n\n \n\nI personally shorted the ARGT ETF last week and it's working out nicely. Other ideas: \n\nSUPV (NYSE) $2.41 -0.05 (-2.03%)\n\nPAM (NYSE) $12.48 -0.50 (-3.85%)\n\nTGS (NYSE) $7.15 -0.35 (-4.67%)\n\nCEPU (NYSE) $2.67 -0.11 (-3.96%)\n\nPrediction: All of these will lose at least 10% or more of their value by 9/20.\n\nGo wild and thank you for attending my full-frontal nudity TED talk.", "created_utc": 1567521833, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cz5stu/serious_right_now_is_the_perfect_time_to_short/", "is_self": true}
