It broke out of consolidation on heavy volume. You can wait for it to get to 28.10 to retest trend or just get in now. I expect 2-3 days of gains so I bought in at 29. I was already long going into Computex, took profits, and am long again after this daily candle set up.\n\nI'm in July 33c with a PT of 33.75, but really I will take half profits after a fat pop tomorrow then hold to break even or PT.", "created_utc": 1559074237, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bu4v1z/amd_technical_set_up/", "is_self": true}
