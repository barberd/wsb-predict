Good- they\u2019ll all buy them when they grow up and get real jobs.\n\nBunch of people short it - who and why care?.  Short squeeze just gets bigger\n\nThey are going to murder Uber and Lyft- I get home with my wife and kids at 6.  Put that bitch on Uber mode and let it make me money until I wake up, at which point it put itself back in my garage and my bank account it fatter.  WTF!  EVERY DAY FOR 8 HOURS WHILE IM AT WORK!!!!????\n\nOH AND VALET MODE - Drop you off at the front of the store, let you shop, then come pick you up!  Parking is NEVER a thing any more.  Think about shit like six flags, Disney land, concerts, sports\n\nJust officially took the crown for fastest production car in history, beating out Porsche spyder 0-60\n\nNo dealership costs!\n\nBatteries betting better and cheaper\n\nFull self driving without the spinning bullshit on top and a jacked up steering column\n\nThey FUCKING AIR DROP UPDATES THAT GIVE YOU MORE HORSE POWER (8% increase right?)\n\nInfluencers and trendsetters seem to own them\n\nNO FUEL\n\nPaint jobs seem to hold up better than their competitors?  That just me?\n\nFalcon doors and other badassness that make them cool to drive\n\n\nOh yeah and they have \u201cEaster eggs\u201d all in them which the kids will relate to.\n\nLittle known fact, in South Africa we had a pizza shop run by two ladies that did such a good job of marketing to kids and supplying pizza to schools that those kids chose them later in life when they had money of their own and the pizza place grew at such an incredible rate many years after that they had payment troubles during their growth, which helped inspire me and lead me to my path!  They conditioned the kids to associate their pizza with the way a pizza should taste, much like we want to condition the upcoming generations to associate the tesla car company with the way a company should be, people like them creating things for them that they can love.", "created_utc": 1557806741, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bodwea/what_exactly_is_the_bear_case_against_tsla/", "is_self": true}
