{"id": "fxkhxy", "title": "Food for thought", "selftext": "I\u2019ve mostly been on the sidelines, and as some of you know, I am a bull, not a bear. I\u2019ve made 5 recent bets. \n\nShares of GS @ 150\nShares of JPM @87\nShares of DIS @ 88 \nSynthetic share position in Wendy\u2019s $11 strike expiring in August, entered for a net debit of .03 \nSPY LEAPS for 12/2022 310 & 320 strikes \n\nHere\u2019s the thesis: \n\nGoldman\u2019s research article kicked off this shit show back in February, so I\u2019m betting they\u2019ve been short this whole time, and the doom and gloom we\u2019re hearing tells me they are still short, so long GS is my hedge. Plus they are one of the smartest shops on the street, trading at a discount to book.\n\nJPM is probably the best run bank on the street, and the fact that they trade at a sizable discount to book is just insanity. Plus, never bet against Jamie. He\u2019ll fuck your shit up. \n\nDIS is a net gainer, for several reasons. The obvious one is that pent up demand will give them a spike, when the world normalizes, but the more important one is Disney+. Because it\u2019s recurring revenue? No. Because Disney is the best cross seller in the world. Every new subscriber represents a lot more than $7/month, when this is taken into consideration. And lastly, Disney is part of the Becky index, and we all know what happens when you bet against Becky. \n\nWendy\u2019s was absurdly cheap at $11. They just came out with breakfast, and we all know how well McDonald\u2019s did with that. Also, fast food gets to stay open, and contrary to popular market sentiment, giving employees temporary raises in a time like this buys you a lot of good will. (For any of you autists that don\u2019t know what a synthetic is, I sold the $11 put, and used the credit to buy the $11 call. When you do this on a red day, it costs almost nothing to enter the trade, giving you effectively a 100 share limit order and free upside in the stock.)\n\nLastly, SPY LEAPS are a great way to lever up. My position has a notional value of around 160k, and I only ponied up roughly 11k. As long as you don\u2019t run out of money to roll, buying as far out as you can and rolling these with 6 months to expiration yields a return that beats the hell out of basically everything.", "created_utc": 1586400865.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxkhxy/food_for_thought/", "is_self": true}
