{"id": "fiiwyr", "title": "Long Call T 9/18", "selftext": "I have a couple grand to spare, I\u2019m sure I missed the boat on the better puts, but hear me out on a call. AT&T has weathered the storm fairly well.\n\nWell positioned with 5G with strong low band and mmWave spectrum portfolio, better than VZ all in on mmWave. Currently available in 80 cities with nationwide launch mid 2020. \n\nThey\u2019ve gone from \u201cwe WON\u2019T sell DIRECTV, to we COULD sell DIRECTV, to we PROBABLY will sell DIRECTV\u201d.  Dish is open to a merger with DIRECTV.\n\nHBO Max launch in May opening up new revenue stream. Coronavirus self quarantine will have an impact on increased sign ups. \n\nWarner Media content being pulled from Netflix and being saved for HBO Max.\n\nI\u2019m not seeing a downside to T with the Coronavirus. Volatility seems low. \n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nEdit: Also with pressure from Elliot Management Fund, T has had to refocus on wireless growth, debt pay down and management as well as board of directors shake up.", "created_utc": 1584195010.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fiiwyr/long_call_t_918/", "is_self": true}
