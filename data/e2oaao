Despite my family repeatedly pleading me to not do this, I see no downside.  Option 1: All the $BECKY\u2019s shelling out their money for coffee this very night allows for me to make astronomical gains.  I retire right now.  I get massive tendies and snort mountains of coke.  Option 2: I go absolutely tits up.  I will delete Robin Hood and destroy my phone.  I\u2019ve already hedged my bet with a plane ticket to Switzerland, and I am going to live peacefully in a log cabin with a  farm, free from the capitalist scum of the US.  I retire right now and live a modest, yet satisfying life.\n\nI am going to be retired by the end of the day.  It\u2019s been a great run, please buy some coffee!", "created_utc": 1574894799, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e2oaao/i_am_retiring_at_801_tomorrow_morning/", "is_self": true}
