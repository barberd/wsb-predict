{"id": "evpg4o", "title": "What Caused BA to Shoot To The Moon This Morning?", "selftext": "Hey Everyone,\n\nI sold some 1/31 327.5 BA Calls yesterday to capitalize on bad news over at Boeing. When I heard that earnings were -2.33 a share compared to the 1.47 expected, I was sure BA would continue to slide come today's open, yet the price jumped 2.5% following today's open and had me on the edge of my seat all morning. Fortunately (for me at least), the price never topped my strike &amp; I'm still rolling in premium from the calls that I sold, but what do the galaxy-brains of WSB think? Is assuming a poor earnings report will cause short term price shrinkage a fallacy? Or did other positive BA-related news help to offset a poor earnings report?", "created_utc": 1580316666, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/evpg4o/what_caused_ba_to_shoot_to_the_moon_this_morning/", "is_self": true}
