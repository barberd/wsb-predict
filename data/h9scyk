{"id": "h9scyk", "title": "Lurker asking about ALYI", "selftext": "I just started lurking in this subreddit recently because I opened an TDAmeritrade account in April. I wanted to get some insight into trading since I'm new at it so I figured I would make this post.\n\nI have several positions that I consider long term investments but there is one that I'm not sure about.  I had a dozen or so $ to throw away so I put it down on ALYI to the tune of 10,400 shares. The price was only .0056 per share so it wasn't a huge investment.  Is there money to be made in these penny stocks or did I throw my money away? It seems that I bought just as the stock started plummeting. I figured It might be a good bet since the stock has been trading for a long time which tells this amateur investor that it isn't a pump and dump type stock. \n\nAny helpful input would be greatly appreciated.", "created_utc": 1592266536.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h9scyk/lurker_asking_about_alyi/", "is_self": true}
