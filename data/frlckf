Basically as this beer virus continues to go haywire and scare the living shit out of people stocks and companies while lose money! \n\nWith the chart included we see the Yellow descending which has had 7 specific times where we got rejected! As we approach the next time we will likely meet the floor (18,000) left and possibly bounce around for a few days to weeks.(floor being the red line) the top of the last lower high being (22,700) and lowest level being (18,200) could mean we see a move of up to (4,500) on the Dow! Which is the distance from red line (floor) to the white line on bottom (14,000) here are my predictions for the Dow for the next 1 month!!", "created_utc": 1585548011.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frlckf/gay_bears_celebrate/", "is_self": true}
