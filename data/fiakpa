If I add enough sarcasm I think it's ok? \n\nQualified money:\n\nUnder the new SECURE Act non-spouse beneficiaries will have to drawdown the entire account over 10 years.\n\nSpouses are always the best persons to name as they get to roll the accounts over into their own name. If they are sub 55 (401k) or sub 59.5 (IRA) they can always leave the money in an inherited account and tap into it penalty free if they need it.\n\nOn the non-spouse side:\n\nFor Traditional 401(k)/IRA Accounts: \nThe beneficiary will be taxed at ordinary income rates. That means that, most likely, the cheapest way to get the funds out will be an even drawdown. Naming proper beneficiaries is important and the after effects of taxation can impact the gift you leave. Your kids may be lower earners, so it may be wise to name them and they can get the money out at a lower effective rate.\n\nFor Roth 401(k)/IRA Accounts:\nBeneficiaries won't ever be taxed on the amount or the growth it has. This is tempting because most degenerate beneficiaries just hear tax-free and pull the lump sum. Chat with whoever you're leaving you tendies to and let them know that \"you need to let the Roth tendies cook for another 10 years to get maximum crispiness\". Seriously, if you leave a nice pile of money you already were taxed on and is still eligible for 10 more years of tax-free growth, you're a fool for not taking advantage.\n\n\nOn the non-qualified (brokerage) money:\n\nTOD: Stands for Tendies on Death. This allows you to name a beneficiary directly, just like your IRA, and keep the courts our of it. There is generally no charge for this. They don't have any rights to your accounts while you are still mouth-breathing so it just makes sense. Whoever inherits gets a step up so there is no tax consequences if they sell all your unreal gainz and rebalance to their own preferences.\n\nJTWROS: Stands for Juicy Tendies Will Ruin OUR Stove. The key here is \"our\". This is a joint account with another owner. When you die, they keep the tendies which is fun during coronavirus so at least there is some form of competition and prize for outlasting the competition. The key here is you will get a step up on half of it (non-community property state) or all of it (community property state). A good idea for spouses who are OK sharing or \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bs who want to spread their AIDs (that one hurt to type.)\n\n\nOdds and ends:\n\nContingents: if by some miracle you outlast your first pick to receive your treasure, this asks as a backup so it doesn't go to your estate. Always name one where available.\n\nDurable POA: this names someone who can sell your ITM puts if you get quarantined with no wifi. Don't pay someone to do this, download a springing POA for your state, fill it out and sucker a notary at your local bank to stamp it for you while you pretend your interested in CDs.\n\nAnything I'm forgetting please add below. I know this sub is just \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b and perma\ud83d\udc02 but be responsible.", "created_utc": 1584148620.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fiakpa/psa_if_youre_vulnerable_to_boomer_cancer_please/", "is_self": true}
