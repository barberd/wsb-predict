I got interested in trading through WSB (probably not the best way to get started), and grabbed a Robinhood account at the beginning of the year. \n\nI\u2019ve made a number of trades, and made some small gains (from my ~350 start to my current 1700), but the issue is I did that without actually understanding what I was doing. I was just predicting stock movements (mostly FB and AAPL), and thought of it as gambling on the stock\u2019s movement.\n\nI didn\u2019t understand what assignment was, and managed to dodge that bullet for half a year. Now I finally know what it is, and with my current round of FB calls being very likely to expire well in the money (and having already been sold by the time I came to learn this basic information, two 182.5 contracts Friday and 3 185 contracts yesterday), I find myself fairly terrified of the risk I\u2019m at right now/for the remainder of the week. All of these contracts are 6/21 exp (in true WSB fashion).\n\nRight now I have 4 FB 192.5 contracts, same exp, and I am not really sure what to do. Should I hold them and pray that at least one of the contracts doesn\u2019t get assigned at the end of the week? Should I sell them all and just pray that the market moves in my favor towards the end of the week (seems pretty unlikely). Is there anything else I can do, as someone with very little money who was doing this for fun?\n\nOr at I just kind boned?\n\nAlso feel free to laugh at my idiocy. If I wasn\u2019t so terrified I would too.", "created_utc": 1560858119, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c217pw/terrified_of_assignment_the_story_of_a_moron/", "is_self": true}
