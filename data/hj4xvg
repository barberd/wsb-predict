Fastly is a CDN tech company with market cap at $8 billion. Whether it is overpriced or not, CDN stocks gets lots of traction as people stay at home during this covid-19 season because people are basically staying at home watching tv shows, playing videos and what not.\n\nI recently discover another CDN company that have potential for growth. Yes, you guess it right! It's Limelight Network. The market cap is just shy at $800 million. I haven't seen any tech companies with this low in market cap, let alone the tech industry. I believe the price could be at least $15 with the traction from investors that love stay-at-home tech stock. I have created a spreadsheet to compare Fastly and Limelight Network in terms of products, customer base, financial and earning.\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GhP7kJ4d5dM5m3j81\\_wfWbOYSX9ooBEeElClwQk4tqY/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GhP7kJ4d5dM5m3j81_wfWbOYSX9ooBEeElClwQk4tqY/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nDisclaimer: I have options 10c of Limelight expired in August.", "created_utc": 1593584782.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hj4xvg/limelight_network_dd/", "is_self": true}
