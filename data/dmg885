Economic data was unimpressive, though, as Q3 GDP growth slowed in South Korea and Japan's preliminary manufacturing PMI for October slipped further into contraction territory with a reading of 48.5 (prior 48.9). Separately, The Bank of Indonesia cut its key lending rate 25 basis points, as expected, to 5.00%.\n\n* In economic data:\n   * South Korea's Q3 GDP +0.4% qtr/qtr (expected +0.5%; last +1.0%)\n   * Japan's prelim. October manufacturing PMI 48.5 (last 48.9); Leading Economic Index for August 91.9 (expected 91.7; last 93.7)\n   * Hong Kong's September exports -7.3% m/m (last -6.3%) and imports -10.3% m/m (last -11.1%)\n\n\\---Equity Markets---\n\n* **Japan's Nikkei:** \\+0.6%\n* **Hong Kong's Hang Seng:** \\+0.9%\n* **China's Shanghai Composite:** flat\n* **India's Sensex:** \\-0.1%\n* **South Korea's Kospi:** \\+0.2%\n* **Australia's ASX All Ordinaries:** \\+0.3%\n\n\\---FX---\n\n* USD/JPY:-0.1% to 108.60\n* USD/CNH: +0.2% to 7.0716\n* USD/INR: +0.4% to 70.978\n\n**Europe**: DAX +0.6%, FTSE +1.0%, CAC +0.6%\n\nMajor European indices have a bounce in their step this morning, posting gains across the board in advance of the ECB interest rate decision at 07:45 ET.\u00a0 Investor sentiment being helped by the positive bias in the U.S. market, which has taken root after better-than-expected earnings news. Automaker Daimler is seeing a nice bid after its third quarter report and is helping to lend support, yet Nokia is a major laggard in European action after cutting its outlook for 2019 and 2020. Preliminary manufactuing PMI data for October remained underwhelming. Separately, attention being paid to reports that UK Prime Minister Johnson is likely to call for early elections if the Brexit deadline is pushed out to the end of January 2020.\n\n* In economic data:\n   * Eurozone's Prelim October Manufacturing PMI 45.7 (expected 46.1; last 45.7); prelim Services PMI 51.8 (expected 51.9; last 51.6); Composite 50.2 (expected 50.3; last 50.1)\n   * Germany's Prelim October Manufacturing PMI 41.9 (expected 42.0; last 41.7); prelim Services PMI 51.2 (expected 52.0; last 51.4); Composite 48.6 (expected 48.8; last 48.5)\n   * France's Prelim October Manufacturing PMI 50.5 (expected 50.0; last 50.1); prelim Services PMI 52.9 (expected 51.6; last 51.1); Composite 52.6 (expected 51.0; last 50.8)\n   * Spain's Q3 Unemployment Rate 13.9% (expected 13.9%; last 14.0%)\n\n\\---Equity Markets---\n\n* **STOXX Europe 600:** \\+0.6%\n* **Germany's DAX:** \\+0.6%\n* **U.K.'s FTSE 100:** \\+1.0%\n* **France's CAC 40:** \\+0.6%\n* **Italy's FTSE MIB:** \\+0.9%\n* **Spain's IBEX 35:** \\+0.6%\n\n\\---FX---\n\n* EUR/USD: unch at 1.1127\n* GBP/USD: -0.2% to 1.2892\n* USD/CHF: unch at 0.9902\n\n**DISCLAIMER: ALL CONTENT COURTESY OF** [**ATOM FINANCE**](https://atom.finance)**!**", "created_utc": 1571922842, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dmg885/morning_briefing_10242019/", "is_self": true}
