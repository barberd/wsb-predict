But I noticed that if you take the all time high, draw a trend line to the high of the first rally, and continue it above where we are, you can see that the trend line will most likely be a resistance to this rally, somewhere around 2650. I know this market is fucked and TA doesn't really work in times like these, but this is basic trend line elementary shit. I'm no wizard, but it seems highly likely to be a nice entry point for puts or a nice exit point for calls. We shall see what the circus brings, but it wouldn't surprise me to see this rally tank once it reaches that expected trend line.", "created_utc": 1585237373.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpdoye/prediction_this_rally_hits_2650_then_sells_off/", "is_self": true}
