Good morning and happy Saturday to all of you on this subreddit. I hope everyone made out pretty nicely in the market last week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead! :)\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 18th, 2019.\n\n# **Week Ahead: Fed to make important forecasts as stocks on 'precipice' of breaking out  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/15/fed-to-make-forecasts-as-stocks-on-precipice-of-breaking-out.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The Fed's meeting is the big deal for markets in the coming week, and it is widely expected to send a message that investors in both bonds and stocks could find bullish.\n*****\n&gt; But analysts in both markets say the Fed's message has been well telegraphed, and market response could be tepid or even a \"sell the news\" reaction.\n*****\n&gt; The key for both markets will be what the economic data shows, after a series of weak reports. Thursday's regional Philadelphia Fed survey and PMI data Friday on manufacturing and the services sectors will be important. Existing home sales are also released Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; \"The first quarter has not exactly been a hallelujah quarter, and the Fed has to acknowledge that,\" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed is expected to hold interest rates steady, but it is also expected to issue a new forecast with fewer rate hikes and a slower economy. The Fed also is likely to announce the end of its operation to unwind its balance sheet, but economists are divided on which month this year it will actually end the program.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks surged in the past week with the best performance since November for the S&amp;P 500, which ended up 2.9 percent. At the same time Treasury yields, which move opposite price, continued to fall. The bench mark 10-year Treasury slipped below 2.60 percent Friday, its lowest yield since June 4, and the 2-year was at 2.43 percent.\n*****\n&gt; The fact that both markets are rising at the same time is somewhat unusual, and at some point the trend could break in favor of one market versus the other.\n*****\n&gt; An easier Federal Reserve, meaning one less inclined to drive up rates, is viewed as a positive for stocks because higher interest rates can slow the economy and send borrowing costs higher for companies and investors. Bond yields also head lower when the Fed is not likely to raise interest rates.\n*****\n&gt; \"This could be an interesting week,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. He said it should be positive for stocks if the Fed reduces its forecast for rate hikes and delivers on expectations.\n*****\n&gt; \"This is the meeting where we get more clarity on the balance sheet reduction. Both those things would be an affirmation of where things are right now. It's also technical\u2026where we close [on the S&amp;P] puts us on a precipice of breaking out,\" said Hogan.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 closed at 2,822, near the key 2,825 level which is the upper end of a big band of resistance. \"The only down week of the year was the week before this, and the trend has been higher,\" he said.\n*****\n&gt; But Paul Christopher, Wells Fargo Investment Institute chief international investment strategist, said the stock market could actually have little reaction to the Fed because Fed officials have been very dovish in public comments.\n*****\n&gt; \"It could be neutral or perhaps even negative. What more can they say? You might see some people selling the fact,\" he said. Christopher said he sees the market as stretched, and it could sell off. But then, there could be a buying opportunity.\n*****\n&gt; \"We think stocks have to start to feel better about the economy first,\" he said, adding a trade deal with China could be a positive.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed's actions could also already be priced into the bond market, according to George Goncalves, head of fixed income strategy at Nomura. He said what really matters is what risk markets, or stocks, do in response.\n*****\n&gt; \"There's scope for risk to do better and the Fed's not hiking. You can see it rally into the summer and the economy will look better and if that happens that will be a buying opportunity for rates,\" he said.\n*****\n&gt; Economists see the Fed reducing its forecast for two rate hikes to one or even none for this year. They also expect it to say it will end its program to reduce the balance sheet, but they don't agree on whether that happens in June, September or closer to the end of the year.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed is currently reducing its balance sheet by allowing securities to roll down as they mature, instead of replacing all of them as it previously did. It now theoretically could allow $60 billion a month to roll off, but Fed officials could change that program and begin to repurchase securities to replace them.\n*****\n&gt; The markets are also waiting to hear if the Fed will focus solely on Treasury securities, and at what part of the curve \u2013 or duration. In the past it had purchased mortgages but is expected to discontinue that.\n*****\n&gt; \"We think they're back to buying Treasurys by Oct. 1. Somethings got to give. At some point, its either that [bond market] people are too pessimistic and the economy is going to do well because the Fed is behind the curve, or we have another kind of correction on our hands in the next six to nine months,\" he said. \"We just have to pass through time There's a powerful faith-based system around easy money can fix all things.\"\n*****\n&gt; Swonk said she expects the Fed to continue to forecast one rate hike for this year. The Fed interest rate forecasts appear as anonymous dots from individual Fed officials on a chart, known as the \"dot plot.\"\n*****\n&gt; Even so, she doesn't expect the Fed will actually raise rates but it will continue to give itself flexibility. Economic data has been mixed with some very poor reports, like December's retail sales, which fell 1.6 percent, and February's jobs report, which showed job growth of just 20,000 jobs, 160,000 below forecast.\n*****\n&gt; \"I think they have to walk a fine line between acknowledging the weakness we've seen and then also show that we're still going to see growth this year,\" she said.\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/o0pDJXr.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/kBp9n1f.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/c1IYRzX.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/K46gPv6.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jZuMWuS.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pzeom1o.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lEbfODX.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/K4AdHOF.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NIPJ8sV.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jZdyLdK.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/UPm6C69.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/sfSMisb.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Irish Eyes Shine on Market Last 25 Years, but Monday After Sunday St. Patrick\u2019s Day Weaker\n\n&gt; Saint Patrick\u2019s Day is the only cultural event that perennially lands in March. Over the years gains the day before Saint Patrick\u2019s Day have proved to be slightly better than the day itself and the day after. Perhaps it\u2019s the anticipation of the patron saint\u2019s holiday that boosts the market and the distraction from the parade down Fifth Avenue that causes equity markets to languish. Perhaps it\u2019s the all the green folks don that stirs up thoughts of money and market gains. More likely, it\u2019s the fact that Saint Pat\u2019s typically falls in historically bullish Triple-Witching Week.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c625182aa350a6356847eb0e14d70a58/tumblr_inline_poey5afw611spdppr_1280.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Whatever the case, since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 posts an average gain of 0.19% on Saint Patrick\u2019s Day (or the next trading day when it falls on a weekend), a gain of 0.13% the day after and the day before averages a 0.24% advance. S&amp;P 500 median values are 0.17% on the day before, 0.20% on Saint Patrick\u2019s Day and 0.07% on the day after.\n\n&gt; In the nine years when St. Patrick\u2019s Day falls on a Sunday like this year, since 1950, Friday advanced an average 0.15% and the following Monday suffered an average loss of -0.08%. However, over the last 25 years market performance on Saint Patrick\u2019s Day and the day after has improved, up 72% of the time on the Holiday with an average gain of 0.57%.\n\n*****\n\n# The Bespoke Report \u2013 Break Out the Monocle\n\n&gt; Below is an updated look at our ETF Asset Class Performance Matrix, which shows the total returns of key ETFs across assets classes on both a YTD, MTD basis as well as over the last week. How strong were global equity markets this week? Well of all the equity-related ETFs in the matrix, not a single one finished the week in the red. Even Industrials (XLI), which were dragged down by Boeing (BA), managed to eke out a gain of 0.2%. Among US indices, the Nasdaq 100 blew away the field rallying over 4%, but every other US index ETF was up over 1.4%. International markets were even stronger with India (PIN), Brazil (EWZ), and China (ASHR) all rallying more than 4%. Rounding out the four names from BRIC, Russia (RSX) even rallied 3.5%. In terms of YTD leaders, China and Crude oil are neck and neck for the top spot with gains of 25%+.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/031519-Asset-Class-Performance.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Most Loved Stocks in the S&amp;P 500\n\n&gt; Earlier this week we provided a full update on analyst sentiment across sectors and individual stocks in our Closer report. Below are a few charts and tables that we\u2019ve pulled from the big report in case you\u2019re interested.\n\n&gt; As shown below, there are 22 analyst ratings per stock in the S&amp;P 500 on average. But Energy and Communication Services have more than 29 ratings per stock! It\u2019s hard to find an edge with nearly 30 analysts covering a name.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ratingsper.png))**\n\n&gt; Notably, the Energy sector also has the highest percentage of analyst Buy ratings, which is surprising given that Energy has been the weakest sector of the market since the S&amp;P peaked last September. It looks like analysts think the sell-off for Energy has caused valuations to become more attractive.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/buyratings.png))**\n\n&gt; Below is a table listing the S&amp;P 500 stocks with the highest percentage of Buy ratings right now. There are 3 stocks in the index that have 100% Buy ratings \u2014 Marathon Petroleum (MPC), ABIOMED (ABMD), and Keysight Tech (KEYS). Both MPC and ABMD are basically flat this year, but KEYS is up 39% YTD. Even after the gains, though, analysts still love KEYS.\n\n&gt; Other notables on the list of most loved stocks include mega-caps like Amazon.com (AMZN) with 93.9% Buy ratings, Alphabet (GOOGL) with 93.2% Buy ratings, and Microsoft (MSFT) with 91.9% Buy ratings. Diamondback Energy (FANG) is the most loved Energy sector stock, while AMETEK (AME) is the most loved Industrials stock.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/most-buys.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&amp;P 500 Sector Trailing 12-Month P/E Ratios\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500\u2019s trailing 12-month P/E ratio got down into the low 15s at the bottom in late December, but we\u2019ve seen huge P/E expansion as the market has rallied back. As of this afternoon, the S&amp;P\u2019s trailing 12-month P/E sits at 18.61. Even still, that\u2019s well below readings in the 20s that were seen for a number of weeks in 2018.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/spxpe0315.png))**\n\n&gt; Below we show one-year P/E ratio charts for major S&amp;P 500 sectors. Since the December lows, we\u2019ve seen P/E expansion in every sector, but the one that stands out the most is Utilities.\n\n&gt; We went into detail on extended valuations for the Utilities sector in yesterday\u2019s Chart of the Day for members, but you can see the spike up to 19.80 in the one-year chart for Utilities below. At 19.80, only Technology, Health Care, and Consumer Discretionary have higher trailing 12-month P/E ratios than Utilities right now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pes1.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pes2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Pre-Election-Year March Historically Stronger\n\n&gt; As of today\u2019s close, this pre-election year March is below average when compared to it historical performance. Strong market performance in pre-presidential-election year frequently translates into above average performance for individual months. March is a month that typically enjoys a nice boost, but so far it has not occurred. Prior to the gains of today and yesterday, this March was well off its average levels. This March and past pre-election year average performance has been plotted in the chart above and the gap in performance is readily visible.\n\n&gt; Strong gains in January and February had major indexes right at key resistance levels at the start of the month and when they failed to break out profit taking ensued. Slowing global growth, naming in China and the EU along with ongoing trade concerns and last Friday\u2019s tepid jobs report have all weighed on stocks. Heavy selling of DJIA\u2019s largest component, Boeing (BA) has kept that index in check this week. Despite sign of slowing growth, the US economy is still on relatively firm ground when compared to other regions. Further market gains are likely, but progress is probably going to be choppy.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/240ec014a88232565f1ddd73d819e3a5/tumblr_inline_po9tds4Dcv1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# What Type of Pullback Could We See?\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index corrected nearly 20% from the September peak until December 24 before staging a furious rally of 19%. What could happen next? A well-deserved pullback would be perfectly normal, and in fact, is probably needed before another surge higher can occur. Now the $64,000 question: Would a pullback be a retest of the December lows, a 10% correction, or something more modest?\n\n&gt; As we discussed in our recent Weekly Market Commentary: Modest Pullback Or Something Bigger? we think a pullback in the range of 3\u20135% is the most likely scenario. \u201cWe continue to see solid fundamentals, valuations that are quite reasonable, the strong possibility of a U.S.-China trade deal over the coming months, and healthy market technicals,\u201d explained Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. In fact, six technical indicators we mentioned in the recent commentary suggest a pullback could offer buying opportunities for suitable investors:\n\n&gt; * The S&amp;P 500 is above its upward sloping 50-day moving average (MA), suggesting an improving trend, and at support in the form of its 200-day moving average.\n&gt; * March has been the second strongest month for the stock market over the past 20 years.\n&gt; * Stocks tend to go up in the final 10 months of a year (25 out of the last 27 years) after experiencing gains during January and February.\n&gt; * Market breadth is favorable, with a high proportion of stocks participating in this year\u2019s advance.\n&gt; * Investor flows have been negative in 2019\u2014evidence of caution, not euphoria\n&gt; * Investor sentiment surveys suggest bulls are not in overabundance.\n\n&gt; Last, as our LPL Chart of the Day shows, it\u2019s important to remember that the S&amp;P 500 has been higher a year after every midterm election since World War II\u2014that\u2019s 18 out of the past 18 midterms\u2014with an average return of 14.2%. President Trump views the stock market as part of his re-election path, suggesting this pattern could hold once again. With the S&amp;P 500 up only 1.3% since the midterm election last November, there indeed could still be room for stocks to run in 2019.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Stocks-Have-Done-Well-After-Midterm-Elections.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for March 15th, 2019** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 3.17.19 - Back to all time highs?** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$TLRY** \n&gt; * **$MU** \n&gt; * **$OSTK** \n&gt; * **$NVAX** \n&gt; * **$LL** \n&gt; * **$FDX** \n&gt; * **$NKE** \n&gt; * **$HQY** \n&gt; * **$PLX** \n&gt; * **$DSW** \n&gt; * **$UNIT** \n&gt; * **$ZUO** \n&gt; * **$GIS** \n&gt; * **$ACRS** \n&gt; * **$STNE** \n&gt; * **$JKS** \n&gt; * **$TIF** \n&gt; * **$DRI** \n&gt; * **$NVGS** \n&gt; * **$CSIQ** \n&gt; * **$HDS** \n&gt; * **$CAG** \n&gt; * **$TME** \n&gt; * **$SYNH** \n&gt; * **$MIK** \n&gt; * **$TACO** \n&gt; * **$SMAR** \n&gt; * **$AMRS** \n&gt; * **$TLGT** \n&gt; * **$WSM** \n&gt; * **$LEJU** \n&gt; * **$BITA** \n&gt; * **$CMC** \n&gt; * **$MTBC** \n&gt; * **$GEN** \n&gt; * **$CELP** \n&gt; * **$GPX** \n&gt; * **$YIN** \n&gt; * **$WKHS** \n&gt; * **$HZN** \n&gt; * **$GES** \n&gt; * **$WPM**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/NIPJ8sV.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/OQYi4c1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/JsxWsJc.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S MOST NOTABLE PRE-MARKET EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/nFRh0bk.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.18.19 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8oXi6MW.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.18.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/xCALfZ6.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.19.19 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/4d1zoM2.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.19.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/y2MoJ8V.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.20.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/GvK7hok.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.20.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/87c4Gw9.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.21.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/XFD8LSR.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.21.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/nXt8qpy.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.22.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/KcK1ci9.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.22.19 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Tilray, Inc. $72.50 \n&gt; **Tilray, Inc.
