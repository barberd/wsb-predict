{"id": "ekvqb6", "title": "Why Slack Will be Acquired", "selftext": "This time last year, Slack Technologies, the popular workplace chat provider, was one of the most eagerly anticipated public tech debuts of 2019. That seems like a long time ago. Since Slack went public in June, its stock has dropped about 40%.\n\n\nThe reason for the slump: Revenue growth at Slack is slowing and competition is intensifying, especially from Microsoft. The tech giant is relying on a familiar tactic\u2014bundling a Slack killer with a widely used existing product, its Office 365 suite of apps. Given that competitive pressure, I predict 2020 will be the year that\u2014after years of acquisition speculation\u2014a larger tech company will finally buy Slack.\n\n\nPotential suitors could include Amazon\u2014which has reportedly eyed Slack in the past\u2014and Google. Both companies are top providers of cloud computing services and could plug Slack into their cloud units to increase the revenue they generate from online applications. \n\n\nAlready a big Amazon cloud customer, Slack has committed to spending a minimum of $250 million with the Amazon Web Services division between 2018 and 2023, according to regulatory filings. Becoming part of Amazon could help Slack\u2014which is currently unprofitable\u2014trim some costs.    \n\n\nCisco Systems and Salesforce, both of which could use a spark to fire up their collaboration software businesses, might also make sense as acquirers. Both companies have relationships with corporate chief information officers that could open the door to customers in the Fortune 500. \n\n\nA Slack purchase would be a sizable deal. Slack has a market capitalization of just over $12 billion, although its management would likely push for a higher price. One benchmark they might point to: A few weeks before it went public, Slack was valued in private market trades at about $19 billion. At that price, Slack would be the largest acquisition ever for the likes of Amazon, Google, Cisco, and Salesforce.  \n\n\nOne company that likely won\u2019t buy Slack is the company that would arguably be most responsible for its sale: Microsoft. Owning Slack, along with its in-house Slack competitor, Teams, would give Microsoft a dominant position in workplace collaboration software. Microsoft reportedly considered offering an $8 billion bid for Slack in 2016 before deciding to funnel more investment into building out Teams. \n\n\nBut I\u2019m skeptical that Microsoft could pull off such a deal. Gaining regulatory approval would be an ordeal, if not impossible, because Microsoft already offers a directly competitive product. Microsoft went through the antitrust wringer two decades ago and is happy to avoid joining other big tech companies in the regulatory spotlight now. \n\n\nSpokespeople from AWS and Salesforce declined to comment. A Microsoft spokesperson didn\u2019t have a comment. Spokespeople from Cisco and Google didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. \n\n\nIf Slack CEO and co-founder Stewart Butterfield doesn\u2019t want to sell, he will have to find a way to win back investor confidence. Clearly what is worrying Wall Street is Slack\u2019s slowing revenue growth and increasing losses. \n\n\nThe company\u2019s annual sales grew 110% in fiscal 2018, which ended last Jan. 31, from the prior year. In fiscal 2019, that figure fell to 82%. In its most recent earnings report, Slack forecast that revenue growth for fiscal 2020 will fall even further to around 55%. Meanwhile, its net loss rose to about $88 million in the third quarter, from nearly $48 million a year earlier.\n\n\nSlack has spread like wildfire as a business tool largely through a free version of its product. To continue to grow, it must find ways to convince these users to become paying ones. During its recent earnings call, for the quarter ended Oct. 31, the company said it had 105,000 paying customers, up 30% from the same period a year earlier. \n\n\nIn an interview, Daniel Newman, founder and principal analyst at Futurum Research, said Slack\u2019s early growth was partly due to developers\u2019 frustration with the limitations of older products like Microsoft\u2019s Skype and Cisco\u2019s Webex. Now, with Microsoft pouring money into Teams and making improvements to the product to entice large companies, Slack has to work much harder to attract customers, he said. And a host of younger companies, such as Zoom and Asana, and open source startups, including Mattermost and Rocket.Chat, also offer workplace collaboration tools. \n\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of competition in the collaboration space right now,\u201d Newman said. \n\n\nThe growing competition highlights another issue for Slack. Having captured a loyal following of developers and technical users through word of mouth, it is now spending heavily on sales and marketing to show how its software can help companies be more productive. During the third quarter, its sales and marketing expenses jumped 42% to over $96 million. \n\n\nMicrosoft appears to have gotten into Butterfield\u2019s head. This first became apparent in 2016 when Slack took out a full-page ad in The New York Times to \u201cwelcome\u201d Microsoft to the market around the time it introduced Teams. More recently, Butterfield has sounded a defensive note on earnings calls, pointing out that Slack has to earn every customer and can\u2019t rely on bundling its product with other business applications, as Microsoft does. \n\n\nHe often pushes back on Microsoft\u2019s framing of its daily active user numbers for Teams, claiming that the company muddies the waters by counting people who make voice calls using Skype. Slack\u2019s usage figures more accurately reflect the deep level of engagement its users have with the service, according to Butterfield. \u201cThe confusion is deliberately created,\u201d Butterfield said on Slack\u2019s recent fiscal third quarter earnings call with investors. \n\n\nWhatever the reason, Butterfield faces a choice: Keep fighting or surrender by selling.", "created_utc": 1578325244, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ekvqb6/why_slack_will_be_acquired/", "is_self": true}
