I've been a seller of premium for a year now, but I have bought only a handful of naked option calls. My question to you guys is, on the SPY, what is your preferred delta to buy at, and what is your preferred length of time of the contract you are getting? I understand a lot of you are day trading, but are you getting contracts 2 days out? A week? A month? I expect a bunch of BS answers, but I would appreciate a few serious answers. Thanks for your time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the feedback", "created_utc": 1578014637, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ej7v41/option_buyers_i_have_a_question_for_you/", "is_self": true}
