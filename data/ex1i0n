{"id": "ex1i0n", "title": "Oversold or downtrend?", "selftext": "It seems that the market sold today because:\n1. China expected to drop Monday\n2. Bernie Sanders front-runner for Iowa caucus\n\nThe market went on a bull run since October, but we are seeing record highs from the tech sector:\nIntel, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook (although it went down due to increasing operating costs), AMD (although it went down due to conservative guidance), Amazon\n\nOn Thursday, near the closing bell, there was a bull vs. bear match at the end where the bears where trying to sell, but the bulls kept it up. At the end of Friday, the bulls were trying to buy, but the bears kept it down.\n\nDo you think we are oversold or are we on a downtrend? Discuss.\n\nI think it got oversold today and the market still has more to run, since all of these companies are still projecting growth. There were many days when the Asian and European markets went down, and we just kept going up. \n\nI think we are past the virus apocalypse, which should have went down when:\n1. WHO declared it a global emergency (we ended up green on Thursday)\n2. U.S. declared it a public health emergency (small rally after announcement)\n\nThe Bernie Sanders thing will be a temporary setback depending on the results, affecting healthcare more than anything. UnitedHealthcare and Aetna posted great earnings and guidance. Humana and Cigna coming up this week. Probably the same results, but will go down because of Bernie Sanders panic.", "created_utc": 1580535137, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ex1i0n/oversold_or_downtrend/", "is_self": true}
