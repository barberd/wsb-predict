The case for shorting VIX through VXX puts", "selftext": "Positions: $22k in VXX $18p June in my TD and another $20k in RH\n\n https://imgur.com/diDbUZa \n\nTLDR: VXX or UVXY puts 50%-80% OTM, June or later \n\n\\----\n\nIf you lost money today on calls/puts for a reason other than the market going the other way, it's due to your implied volatility being destroyed. For everyone not from r/all, this is what happens to option FDs after the report, but on a massive scale that is affecting essentially all options on any assets on the market. \n\nVolatility essentially is at all time highs because no one knows what is going to happen tomorrow. You can go up 10% or go down 10% (as we've seen this week). Those selling these options aren't going to give their risks of losing >100% for cheap. When you buy these options, you are essentially paying for the probability you're still going to get 10% moves every day. \n\nHaving >10% moves per day for extended times (more than 1 month) is essentially impossible. Go look at VIX and you'll see things calm down within 1-2 months. Thus, even if we keep going down, but at 2% of day, IV will drop. This is why VIX looks like a seismic map. \n\nWhy now? \n\nOn technical charts, we've had a bearish engulfing. The top is probably in. \n\n https://imgur.com/CGDKSm7 \n\nThe reason why we had such massive spikes was due to Trump saying nothing during his Oval Office speech and Lagarde saying the ECB isn't responsible for closing the spreads for crap countries like Italy. The ECB has the ability to do this (Draghi did it) but you know... she's French. \n\nAfter two rounds of circuit breakers, governments noticed they messed up. They are actively doing the fiscal and monetary route. Plus, other than Trump getting the virus and 100k cases in the US, the worst like closing Disneyland or NYC is already somewhat priced in. Priced in = at least less probability of huge downswings like this week.\n\nFor all the r/all still running into FD calls or puts, good luck. Please realize that even if you get the direction right, the lack of massive moves will eat into the value of your option. For everyone who has some understanding of how options work, a June (or later) short isn't that bad of a play.", "created_utc": 1584135911.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fi7g5p/did_your_calls_and_puts_decay_today_the_case_for/", "is_self": true}
