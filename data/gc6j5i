{"id": "gc6j5i", "title": "Florida DD", "selftext": "We got old dumb people down here and our entire economy is hospitality, food, and retail - all things that Covid kinda fucks.\n\nTook a ride last night as there is nothing else to do.\n\nAlmost shit myself when I went downtown and seen more people than I could count shoulder to shoulder at his bar. I only seen 1 person with a mask on. It's like we beat Covid. This is the first time I have seen this area with any signs of life since mid March.\n\nI don't care about the $SPY right now, you can keep 5 companies fluffed and it'll maintain a decent value, but volatility will pick up within 30 days imho - 2 weeks for these retards to mingle and 2 weeks for Covid counts to start rising again in these under educated anti-science cities.\n\nI've seen a lot of people mention \"Oh the big panic is done, it'll take WW3 to have a drop like that again\". Well, what happens when these normies realize that Covid doesn't care about their boredom or opinion and that returning to \"normal\" does indeed increase the number of cases and ultimately their chance of exposure/death? You have a large portion of the nation now mentally prepared to reopen and if this reopening goes off the rails everything goes out the window. Truthfully, I wish this particular group the worst, but that's a different conversation as I feel like their haste and recklessness is directly jeopardizing not only mine, but our entire country's future well-being.\n\nROLL WEEKLY VIX PLAYS TO THE UPSIDE BECAUSE MAY 1ST WAS THE START OF THE TIMER ON THIS BOMB and begin longer plays to the downside once we see VIX rip up.\n\nAlso, short anything based in South Florida as these swamp folk don't know the first thing about hygiene or basic health. Plus the number of people I know or friends know that have lost their jobs here is staggering so FL housing is bigly fucked. Even people looking for roommates are willing to let someone move in for as little as $300 a month compared to the normal $700-$1,000 you'd normally see asked for around here.\n\nAlso also, inverse me because I am clearly retarded. Like the type of retarded that's loading up on canned food in case we have a food shortage and/or stagflation. \n\nGod speed,", "created_utc": 1588426387.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gc6j5i/florida_dd/", "is_self": true}
