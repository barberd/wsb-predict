That\u2019s the same reason why no one would pay extra for an IoT Juicer instead of just making their own juice or buying their own juice. I know Rivian got $1,100,000,000 in investments from Ford and Bezos, but I just don\u2019t see them being able to deliver their trucks in 2020. People who buy trucks like that want to take them off-road, not have to worry about puncturing the Li-battery and starting a huge fire that\u2019s almost impossible to put out. Also, there\u2019s no charging stations way out in the middle of nowhere.\n\nI\u2019ll be staying away from both the pre- and post- IPO market on this one.", "created_utc": 1560309074, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bzlz81/rivian_is_going_to_be_the_next_juicero_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
