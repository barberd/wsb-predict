{"id": "g18t31", "title": "WHY EVERYTHING IS GOING TO MOON", "selftext": "So I lost my fucking shorts during this nut-clenching \"bear trap\" and then Trump's little oil pump charade. While I kept seeing all this brrr brrr shit, and laughing, I expected downside, but then I decided to look into the effect of the feds balance sheet on the markets directly.\n\nTime for some fun charts of the Fed Balance Sheet vs the S+P:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kly09btz7ts41.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=36813d1505bd1f7b946eb2f9904715a5be871a3e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xy35kgzc7ts41.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=08cab382194fe79b70298bd166b74f4682fb6f10\n\nAnd now for the 6 trillion dollar printing bonanza:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3axf12pa8ts41.png?width=1434&format=png&auto=webp&s=3df948b2f81b5f4e12ef52117fe4f41f4b5b5746\n\nTLDR: If you thought ETFs were trading disconnected from NAV was crazy, get read for the markets to disconnect from reality (As if that's not already happening...)\n\nI think I'm no longer bearish for Q2, barring some truly \\*unexpected\\* catastrophic news. Record unemployment doesn't count. Record losses don't count. (JPM just shat its pants, but the market  didn't give a nut.)  Basically, we're on the verge of poking our head out of the woods, and we have an ass-ton of money being injected everywhere... \n\nAlso, \\*every moron\\* I know is talking about buying into the market. My girlfriends friends were talking about it over Zoom. They NEVER talk about ANYTHING but Chad. While this is typically the sign of a top, I figure that this conversation will be had again every time a Trump check comes in the mail...\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1586881999.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g18t31/why_everything_is_going_to_moon/", "is_self": true}
