No one knows which way the stock will move in the future and we shouldn't get too excited or agitated based on a short period of time.](https://imgur.com/a/xOpLfrq)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIB said their borrow cost is 182% earlier today (I don't know what it is this afternoon). Others reporting around 130% with new borrows going around 180%. Hopefully this is the start of the squeeze I have been talking about, since I have August calls. If it IS the squeeze, I have NO CLUE where it will wind up. But in an insane, impossible, never will happen scenario: TLRY peaked intraday at $300/share. With 75m shares, that is a market cap of $22.5b. The equivalent price for BYND is $375/share. Obviously I don't think that will happen... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMike", "created_utc": 1562876056, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cc0o62/bynd_please_dont_get_too_excited/", "is_self": true}
