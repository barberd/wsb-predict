{"id": "ewn1sd", "title": "Generally Erect", "selftext": "It was a luke warm afternoon in early September, 2019.  Daddy was planning on hopping a BNSF intermodal from  Minnie westbound to Seattle. I waited under the bridge until three GE dash-9s pulled my steal chariot out from the yard. I was going to wrap my legs around this bad boy and ride into the sunset hoping to arrive in Seattle without tickets.   \n\nTo make a short story long, I arrived home having stroked my McCandless cock enough for the time being three weeks later.  I had my 5 appendages still intact. \n  \nI was still sexually aroused by the thunderous strength of those General Electric Locomotives months later.  (Rule 34? I can\u2019t draw). Anyway, I decided to redownload the Robinhood app I had previously blown up gambling on Bio Penngstocks and make some well reasoned, educated, logical investments to make some money to finance some more traveling.  \n  \nNaturally I transferred a third of my overall negative net wealth into General Electric Call options.  Student loans and car payments can wait, I was going to make more than I was going to lose on their interest anyway.  My point is, I was Generally Erect at this point. I was going to ride these bad boys into the sunset.  I was going to be doing lines of Kane while riding these sexy cocksuckers. \n\nTwo weeks after buying those calls, General Electric sold their Railroad Division to WabTec.  \n  \nLong GE. Also they power a third of the worlds electricity or some shit. That\u2019s cool too", "created_utc": 1580469703, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ewn1sd/generally_erect/", "is_self": true}
