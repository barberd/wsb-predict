{"id": "hfl9pq", "title": "WSB...in prison??!", "selftext": "\"A fun story. I was minding my own business, holding court and espousing the virtues of diversification in my cube. Cube? Cubicle--think, cell without a wall? Anyway, all of a sudden a wild memer appeared. Jake, from WallStreetBets, he announces. Now, in prison, we're normally divided into \"cars\", as I once explained on Instagram. The Bloods have a car. New York City has a car. White Boys, the mass of us, have a car. The car is a metaphor for our ride through prison. We have each others backs, etc. The head of the car is the \"shotcaller\". If there is a dispute between car members, the shotcallers can settle the issue. This arrangement minimizes violence and disturbances. At other prisons, I briefly consulted with various Blood sets (local/decentralized subdivisions of the organization), mostly on financial and accounting matters. I was also inexplicably in the Jamaican car for my first few weeks in prison. I've already said too much.\n\n  Anyway, this was the birth of the first (and last) WSB car in prison. Never would I have thought some rambling autist would enter my cell talking about how I helped him buy AMD years ago. Of course, I love Jake and miss him very much! I'm sure he and I will not be the last WSBetters to be involuntarily assigned a vacation stay in one of the 120 lovely BOP facilities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor clarification, in case any nerdy, humorless liberal wants to decontextualize the above, I have never been in any gang and the idea that I would advise a street gang on financial matters is simply a joke. They don't really listen to the mantra of the efficiency frontier and believe risk can often be asymmetric due to Kahnemanian phenomena in periods of high volatility and rapid absolute beta movement. There is no helping them!\"", "created_utc": 1593088310.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hfl9pq/wsbin_prison/", "is_self": true}
