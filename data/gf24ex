{"id": "gf24ex", "title": "The US government recently has been artificially deflating gold prices by selling more gold on paper DD inside", "selftext": "Trading gold on paper has artificially kept the price down because it introduces much more gold that isn\u2019t actually there. Is this a ticking time bomb for another gold explosion like in 2008? or when 9/11 was an inside job?  I was watching conspiracy videos about Fort Knox and they casually mentioned this phenomena about paper gold. Also they\u2019re doubling down on paper gold as recent as 2018 who knowns what they are doing now. Once this is found out paper gold stock might fall as actual gold goes up a possible 8,000% they said or something. I have always felt like GLD stocks are like a coked up Miami investment bankers idea of gold. More research is welcome and we\u2019ll build a gold statue of Elon musk getting road head and smoking a blunt to pass the time until a depression is real and we get fuckin paid.
