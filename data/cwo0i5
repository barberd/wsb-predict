I have knowledge in R Studio as well + took python classes at the CS department (just to add for the qualifcations, I am going to build on that).\n\nBasically I am eyeing on two master degrees, both offered by the same top tier business school here in Europe:\n\n1) Banking and Finance\n\n2) Quantitative Economics and Finance\n\nI know that 1) has a lot more prestige and might be better for entry opps to the big BBs (GS, JPM, MS, BOAML...) you name them. On the other hand the master degree 2) has a lot more challenging curriculum. \n\nLoads of data work / mathematics / statistics combined with courses in micro/macroeconomics and also finance modules, that curriculum sounds awesome but I don't know anything about entry opps. \n\nI also think for HF trading offers that 2) would be way more suitable then 1) - I really want to emphasise that I am not interested in any IB work outside of trading, I dont want LBO, I dont want M&amp;A, I dont want restructering and so on.\n\nHas someone here insights on this one? I do not really find good ressources for the Quant Econ master so I am still struggling with the decision\n\nThank you!", "created_utc": 1567013589, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cwo0i5/best_academic_background_for_breaking_into_hf/", "is_self": true}
