{"id": "ha8eef", "title": "DD: The Air Down There (playing UALp this week)", "selftext": "Been getting a lot of questions about airlines from my last DD. There is a lot more to this but it\u2019s a trading day so I don\u2019t have time to lay it out as thoroughly, and it\u2019s been hovering in 4-6% range as I predicted. \n\nThere are a few reasons I think the airlines, but in particular, UAL, will take a big dip either overnight, or tomorrow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **It\u2019s overdue:** during Friday\u2019s insanity it stayed stubbornly up at 19%. It saw no weekend correction and only traded slightly down on Monday, and is now up like 5% today. That\u2019s a 25% gain for a struggling ass airline in a three day span during an otherwise volatile market, insanity no matter how much they tell us they\u2019ll bounce back in April. And UAL has been inexplicably less sensitive than the other airlines recently.  Which leads me to point #2\n2. **It\u2019s speculative as all hell:** people are in UAL because they think it has room to run for it\u2019s fall. Not for it\u2019s financials. I know that\u2019s common in this market, but UAL is different because it SHOULD be sensitive to all COVID news. It ducked the past two second-wave cycles this past week. If a stock is this speculative, people are due to do number 3\n3. **Profit takers gonna take:** if people are in this shit for speculation, and the market is going bananas, big fish are gonna take their 25-30% profits from the past week and leave YOU holding the bag. They are not in a fucking dying ass company burning cash like its water that\u2019s hypersensitive to the growing second wave and international wars brewing that will kill airline functionality before it even gets back up. Speaking of second waves, here\u2019s 4:\n4. **Negative news is coming:** JPow hearing, particular the Democratic slaughter tomorrow, is going to set off a wave of negative news. We\u2019ll have international turmoil, Pow-Pow sound bites, corona second wave pumps, it will be an all-out assault on Trump\u2019s presidency and therefore the economy. MM\u2019s will pull and retail investors will follow.  \n5. **Recent implied volatility out the ass:** Big time investors are short on it, very sharply, recently: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/implied-volatility-surging-united-airlines-123812873.html?guccounter=1&guce\\_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce\\_referrer\\_sig=AQAAAKUDFLcbt5W2MPFK-ZvoZ8bKeLCiBWHWGbC4XJjFYSqpY-GwD2Xdx8d6CjgLMyQJT39Hdzd-LTlFGbYlSo5wo0qeopI3lkj\\_MOdDeNnt6016elD7AHR5wMX2fCcoQuHB2skQp-B\\_RzIIKJfFYAD5F0\\_sPsrgloL-pIra311h8TQA](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/implied-volatility-surging-united-airlines-123812873.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKUDFLcbt5W2MPFK-ZvoZ8bKeLCiBWHWGbC4XJjFYSqpY-GwD2Xdx8d6CjgLMyQJT39Hdzd-LTlFGbYlSo5wo0qeopI3lkj_MOdDeNnt6016elD7AHR5wMX2fCcoQuHB2skQp-B_RzIIKJfFYAD5F0_sPsrgloL-pIra311h8TQA)\n\nThey haven\u2019t had a legit negative day since last Thursday and no good news is coming. Short this shit.\n\n**If you\u2019re feeling risky 39 6/19p, if you\u2019re feeling insanely risky 38p.**  \n\n**Otherwise 6/26 39p, but sell after the first big drop day. If it\u2019s compounded with negative news releases about UAL that day though, then let it run 2 days and sell before their next retard-strength rally.**", "created_utc": 1592328259.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ha8eef/dd_the_air_down_there_playing_ualp_this_week/", "is_self": true}
