{"id": "d6wzuy", "title": "Congressional activity: week of 9/23 to 9/27", "selftext": "Congressional activity: week of 9/23 to 9/27\n\nGood Friday, and welcome to this installment of Congressional activity and financial markets. The general idea is that the statements and actions of federal legislators can have an effect on broader markets. \n\nA few things to keep in mind:\n\n- All of this is subject to change at any time (i.e. votes can be delayed, hearings can be canceled, witnesses can be struck). The House and Senate operate under their own rules, and those rules are entirely enforced by the chambers themselves.\n- The House is controlled by Democrats, and the Senate is controlled by Republicans. So if a hearing is happening in the House, it is somewhat safe to assume that it reflect a relatively liberal position. However, the committees have representation by both parties, so the discussion won't be entirely one-sided.\n- In general, recorded votes on the ``floor'' of either chamber are taken the most seriously, followed by votes (or hearings) taken by the full committee, followed by votes (or hearings) by a subcommittee.\n- The Senate is generally taken more seriously than the House, since it moves slower and is less likely to produce legislation. Thus, the legislation it does produce is exceptionally important. A corollary, though, is that the Senate has much less activity in any given week (only 100 members, but the same workload [plus appointments] as the 435-member House).\n- The floor schedule of either chamber is notoriously hard to predict more than a day or two in advance, as it is structured almost entirely by party leadership and can change on the whims of that leadership. Hearings, however, are relatively more stable and scheduled. (In other words, the hearings are much more certain to happen, while the votes can be added or subtracted with much less certainty.)\n- This is not all activity, just activity most likely to be relevant to financial markets. There is also no guarantee this activity has an effect on any individual stock or market. I'm not an expert, and this is not advice. It is the beginning of a discussion.\n\n***\n\nResults from last week:\n\n- I didn't post this. Not much of tradable interest.\n\n***\n\nShared activity (across both chambers):\n\nThe big ones: the House will hold subcommittee hearings on 9/25 on [protecting consumers and fostering competition through the FTC](https://appropriations.house.gov/events/hearings/federal-trade-commission-protecting-consumers-and-fostering-competition-in-the-21st), while the Senate will hold subcommittee hearings on 9/24 on [examining acquisitions of potential competitors by digital platforms](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/competition-in-digital-technology-markets-examining-acquisitions-of-nascent-or-potential-competitors-by-digital-platforms) and its effect on competition. Outside of these hearings, tech officials are privately [putzing around with members](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mnunez/2019/09/19/why-mark-zuckerberg-needed-dc-lawmakers-to-hear-this-week/) in an effort to leverage any new regulation to help protect their market position. But it could also further the [ongoing antitrust investigations against tech giants](https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/3/20847798/google-antitrust-investigation-us-states-attorneys-generals-doj-ftc-regulation).\n\nThree very different aviation hearings. The House will hold subcommittee hearings on 9/25 on [FAA certification](https://appropriations.house.gov/events/hearings/oversight-hearing-faa-aviation-certification). The only listed witness is Daniel Elwell, the Deputy Director of the FAA. Formally under review is whether Boeing should be allowed to play such a large role in its own certification process, which is doubly important given that the FAA Chief Stephen Dickson flew to Washington this week to [``review the changes''](https://komonews.com/news/local/faa-chief-meets-boeing-officials-tries-out-max-simulator) to the MAX software. We could get a sneak peak at how close the MAX is to returning to service (probably further out that anticipated), but we could also see just how heavy-handed the FAA intends to be in the certification process. As a reminder, this same committee invited the same Daniel Elwell [to testify again in late October with the CEO of Boeing](https://www.aerotime.aero/rytis.beresnevicius/23952-house-committee-boeing-ceo-737-max).\n\nCoupled with this are a pair of [House subcommittee hearings on 9/26](https://transportation.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/the-subcommittee-on-aviation-hearing-on_--a-work-in-progress-implementation-of-the-faa-reauthorization-act-of-2018) and [Senate subcommittee hearings on 9/24](https://www.commerce.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/hearings?ID=33B9F44F-4053-42A5-A765-6F04D706AD01) on the reauthorization of the FAA. The Senate hearing is particularly telling: airlines want to [privatize the FAA](https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/privatize-faa), hopefully allowing for the elimination of [air corridors and waypoints](https://www.flightradar24.com/blog/flight-paths-and-great-circles-or-why-you-flew-over-greenland/) in favor of direct, as-the-crow-flies routing. The latter would be a huge cost-saving measure, driving up airline efficiency. Ted Cruz is in charge of the hearings, and DAL, LUV, and AAL are the 9, 10, and 18 leading total [contributors to his campaign committee](https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/contributors?cid=N00033085&amp;cycle=2020).\n\nThe House will hold specialized hearings on 9/26 on [real-time payments in the financial industry](https://financialservices.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=404240), coupled with Senate full committee hearings on 9/25 on [faster payments](https://www.banking.senate.gov/hearings/facilitating-faster-payments-in-the-us). Witnesses at the Senate hearing include a managing director at The Clearing House, the CEO of the Fed of Kansas City, and banking representatives. Expect there to be some discussion of cryptocurrency here, too. \n\nThe House will hold select committee hearings on 9/26 on [innovation in industry for the climate crisis](https://docs.house.gov/Committee/Calendar/ByEvent.aspx?EventID=110026), coupled with Senate subcommittee hearings on [``driving economic growth in reducing emissions''](https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/hearings?ID=5B67AE1F-C2DE-4E70-BC30-E2957D8F5283). \n\n***\n\nHouse activity:\n\nSUPER EASY PLAY ALERT. The House will hold subcommittee hearings on 9/24 on [vaping and e-cigarettes](https://oversight.house.gov/legislation/hearings/don-t-vape-examining-the-outbreak-of-lung-disease-and-cdc-s-urgent-warning-not). The title of the hearing is literally ``Don't Vape,'' and it features a CDC Deputy Secretary scheduled to rail on vaping for hours. The next day, there will be more subcommittee hearings on the [public health threats of e-cigarettes](https://energycommerce.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/hearing-on-sounding-the-alarm-the-public-health-threats-of-e-cigarettes). MO took a dive this week, but I expect unsuspecting investors will see the huge dividend yield and bid it up on Monday, making market close Monday or market open Tuesday the perfect time to buy some puts. Of course, the additional context here is that Trump announced plans to [ban most flavored e-cigarettes](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/09/11/trump-moves-ban-flavored-e-cigarettes/), though that plan had little specifics or a timeline. Those specifics could be announced the day before or between the hearings, which would be a fresh blow to sales. \n\nThe House will hold [subcommittee hearings on 9/25](https://energycommerce.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/hearing-on-making-prescription-drugs-more-affordable-legislation-to) and [subcommittee hearings on 9/26](https://edlabor.house.gov/hearings/making-health-care-more-affordable-lowering-drug-prices-and-increasing-transparency-) on drug price transparency and lowering prescription drug prices. The first hearing covers [HR 3](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF14/20190925/110024/BILLS-1163ih.pdf), [HR 275](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF14/20190925/110024/BILLS-116275ih.pdf), [HR 448](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF14/20190925/110024/BILLS-116448ih.pdf), and [HR 1046](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF14/20190925/110024/BILLS-1161046ih.pdf), all of which would require negotiating prescription drug prices under Medicare Part D. This could open the door for [generics sooner in Medicare](https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2019/09/20/generics-medicare-drug-prices-seniors/), and other side effects harmful to brand-name manufacturers. Also of note is that [Trump supports the measure](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/pelosi-unveils-measure-to-lower-prescription-drug-costs/2019/09/19/e4df6f32-daf6-11e9-bfb1-849887369476_story.html), and there is corresponding action in the Senate.\n\nThe House will hold full committee hearings on 9/24 on [oversight of the SEC](https://financialservices.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=404235). Nothing is particularly interesting, other than the possibility for some rogue accusations of Wall Street behavior. It will also hold subcommittee hearings on 9/24 on [new regulations on the energy industry](https://naturalresources.house.gov/hearings/fossil-fuel-development-protecting-taxpayers-and-eliminating-industry-giveaways), mostly ending subsidies for industry cleanup of energy byproducts (like fracking wastewater).\n\nThe House will spend a lot of its time investigating Trump for various credit-claiming reasons. These investigations include [regularly scheduled, but likely to be subverted, subcommittee hearings on 9/26 on oversight of tax administration](https://appropriations.house.gov/events/hearings/irs-oversight-treasury-inspector-general-for-tax-administration), [subcommittee hearings on 9/23 on the emoluments clause](https://judiciary.house.gov/legislation/hearings/presidential-corruption-emoluments-and-profiting-presidency), and [subcommittee hearings on 9/25 on hotel leases](https://transportation.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/the-subcommittee-on-economic-development-public-buildings-and-emergency-management-hearing-on_--landlord-and-tenant-the-trump-administrations-oversight-of-the-trump-international-hotel-lease).\n\n***\n\nSenate activity: \n\nThe Senate will hold full committee hearings on 9/25 on [perspectives on the livestock and poultry sectors](https://www.agriculture.senate.gov/hearings/perspectives-on-the-livestock-and-poultry-sectors). As we're looking for more evidence of trade talks and compromises, this might be an opportunity to hear how those efforts are going, or at least put additional pressure on them, as the witness list is all agriculture industry representatives.", "created_utc": 1568995314, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d6wzuy/congressional_activity_week_of_923_to_927/", "is_self": true}
