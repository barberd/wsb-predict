Donnie pump not stoking the fires of trade war?\n\nWhat\u2019s the worst case scenario? \n Demand for oil is low and will continue to be low even after we open up. Air travel will remain low for the foreseeable future. Saudis and OPEC playing nice when they see opportunity to hurt the shale, why would they do that? Jobs don\u2019t come online as quickly. People can\u2019t pay their mortgage, how much money of consuming products do you think will happen, not much if any.\n\nThe idea of \u201cpriced in\u201d is the biggest bullshit of\nI don\u2019t know why, but the really smart wall street people (Cramer) says it so. Priced in is more reflective of future p/e where we think the stock earnings will increase over time. At this point in time is 2019 future p/e the same as 2020 future p/e and the same outlook of no uncertainty is known.\n\nGamble with options not your 401k. There\u2019s no upside reward in the next 6 months. Take profits and wait to reposition once the dust settles.
