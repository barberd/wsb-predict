{"id": "fz2f84", "title": "What the fuck is going on with oil now", "selftext": "In a nutshell, we  have a huge global oil supply glut because everything is on lock down  (mainly China).\n\nOil prices have cratered from $70/brl in Jan to $22/brl right now. Saudi  Arabia can survive on this. Russia can go broke slow on this. American  shale dies at this level. So SA & Russia are playing a little footsy  to keep prices down and bankrupt the American shale patches, even  though they absolutely hate each other. But they want that China market  share. Trump knows this and has been doing everything he can to broker a  deal to cut production to get oil prices up. Why? Becuz - our energy  sector in the US (especially the oil sector) is leveraged up their ass  with debt. So much debt, living paycheck to paycheck with bank loans.  Banks are ready to take possession of the smaller companies already kind  of debt.\n\nYou think we've seen a stock market slide? Companies like  Chesapeake and Marathon are probably goners. If that goes up the food  chain to COP or XOM, and they default? (They aren't in the stimulus  package btw, so that would require even more bailout) This stock market  goes tits the \\*\\*\\*\\* up and 45 can kiss 2020 election good bye.\n\nSO. OPEC+  and Russia got together with a bunch of other oil countries (Not the US,  because we have antitrust laws and don't play the monopoly price game)  and agreed to a massive oil production cut to try to stabilize oil  prices. Everyone played nice except Mexico. You probably think Mexico  doesn't matter in this game. But they do. They wanted Mexico to take a  400,000 barrel a day cut as part of the whole 10M/brl a day cut that the  whole group wants to accomplish. Problem. Mexico is hedged up the ass  against oil price crashes (they're like the only one) and said go \\*\\*\\*\\*  yourselves. We're printing money and we like that. So they said, we'll  do 100,000 brls/day cause we want to play ball and there's a global  pandemic. SA said \\*\\*\\*\\* you, no deal.\n\nSo Trump jumps in and says, the US  will make up the 300,000 barrels a day that Mexico won't so can we have  deal plz? SA says \\*\\*\\*\\* you. Why? Because we have never told oil  producers how much they can drill for or not drill for becuz capitalism.  We produce enough oil to have a seat at the oil table with OPEC and  Russia, but we don't play those games. So, the question is - does the  federal government mandate our private oil companies cut production to  make up for Mexico's share to get the deal done? Easy yes, right?  Stabilize prices, everyone wins, right? Except - remember, all these  companies are leveraged like crazy and at these prices if they can't  produce fast enough, they get repoed. So they have to keep selling oil  or they die.\n\nTLDR - Trump needs this deal so the market doesn't go tits up and he can  get re-elected. If we do the deal, capitalism takes another hit and  small oil producers get \\*\\*\\*\\*ed.\n\nUps/Downs: These fucks never find a way to deal and they don't want to. Oil goes to 15 and the shale patch goes tits up. Banks repo. Market crashes. Look, I know we are obsessed with the coronas. BUT - I think oil is where the real battle is. When US oil goes under. And it will. That's what takes the rest of the house of cards with it. \n\nEnergy has already taken it on the chin, so it's a risky short - but bankruptcies are looming in the smaller players.", "created_utc": 1586602040.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fz2f84/what_the_fuck_is_going_on_with_oil_now/", "is_self": true}
