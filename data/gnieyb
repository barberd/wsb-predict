However I think nobody realizes how popular this stuff is. It is flying off the shelves and stores can\u2019t keep up. My sister works for a large grocery store that recently put these things buy one, get one free, and they sold out on the first day. I need something to help me cry myself to sleep at night, so I was disappointed and began searching for more. Turns out, every one of these grocery stores in the whole county was sold out. Two days after the sale started. I can\u2019t find these things anywhere now. The largest consumers of hard seltzers, specifically lemonades, are younger people like college students. Since college moved online, consumption among students AND all you other idiots has been much higher. Summer months are also looking bright for the lemonades and hard seltzers. Boston beer is going to report some earth shattering sales for Q2.\n\nBasically buy any calls on SAM and you will drown in money, because we have all been drowning ourselves in delicious alcoholic lemonade that isn\u2019t gay (like mikes hard)", "created_utc": 1590004011.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gnieyb/boston_beer_is_going_to_continue_to_rise_through/", "is_self": true}
