To move the entire market?", "selftext": "All the talk of the PPT got me thinking about how much money would be required to move the market up or down on a daily basis.\n\nHow would I go about calculating this?\n\nOne way that comes to mind is to get the order book for each stock in the S&amp;P500, and then calculate how much money would be required to take all the shares on offer at a certain ask price. Sum up this amount for every stock, and that's how much is required to move the entire market.\n\nDoes that sound right? Anyone have better ideas here?", "created_utc": 1562599595, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/camgc3/how_to_calculate_the_amount_of_money_required_to/", "is_self": true}
