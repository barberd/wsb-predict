We saw two tickers doing large volume in dark pool, $UBS and $VIRT\n\n**tl;dr these two tickers move a lot of shares off-market**\n\n**Actual FDs: $UBS 12.5c 7/17, $VIRT 30c 7/17**\n\nBias: Investment banking stonk gonna rip.  Regular banking too, likely.  This is not a finance crisis, not since the Fed got hard anyway.  Finance all did great numbers last quarter.  Next earnings will have the full fury of this wild market priced in, plus all the juice from stimulus and fed action.\n\n$VIRT is small stack, and busting nut.  Killed last earnings and sank further, been doing mad business ever since according to FINRA.  Below is a 3 month graph of Williams%Rs.  As you can see it is pushing local highs, rocket not pictured.  Buy this one if you think more high!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Do Not Trust This Chart](https://preview.redd.it/f3g2e7mvhq151.png?width=1795&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba85a4c4078ab493968ae5fc57dae34d48f86fa7)\n\n$UBS is Swiss old school bank.  Same chart for UBS below shows trending low lows (orange line).   UBS is also at 5 year lows, which no other major Investment Banking ticker can boast.  Buy this one one if you think too low!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Caution:  some other tard's chart](https://preview.redd.it/cw3qoftwhq151.png?width=1781&format=png&auto=webp&s=cfbd5f89e2f3f4dc42f42a7b2471282d3fbc878f)", "created_utc": 1590773613.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gsxcbj/two_finance_tickers_ubs_virt_based_dd/", "is_self": true}
