Opening up with 20-50% capacity isn't going to work financially, and even if they could, there's no movies being made.  \n\nMovie theaters are done.  Ditch the normalcy bias you retard, it's the reality of our new world.\n\nMovies, however, are not done.  They'll allow streaming on services like NFLX.  NFLX will allow you to purchase specific movies or they'll probably have a higher tier subscription where you get all the new releases.  Either way, they're going to get way the hell more subscribers and more money out of each of those subscribers.\n\nNFLX will be the new global media giant.\n\n5/15 $515.", "created_utc": 1586925997.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1l7gs/nflx_will_be_the_dominant_global_media_giant/", "is_self": true}
