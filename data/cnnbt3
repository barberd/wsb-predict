{"id": "cnnbt3", "title": "Heavy Hands", "selftext": "Just woke up this morning and sold my AMD 29.5 calls. Felt good, it's my biggest options play yet (though it's not exactly a yolo so idk that you gamblers would care that much but I'm happy and gains are gains) but this post is more a friendly reminder about patience and also about buying options a decent ways out. I tried to buy the dip on Friday and suffered through that amazing ass-kicking we all saw on Monday. My options were down to almost half their value, and the rest of my portfolio took a hit, but I bought for 8/31, and I knew the market had some time to recover, and boy nothing quite like waking up to an almost triple bagger. \n\nMuch love to everyone on this sub for keeping me company on Monday and being as autistic as me in general. I wish yachts and lambos for all of you.", "created_utc": 1565278257, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cnnbt3/heavy_hands/", "is_self": true}
