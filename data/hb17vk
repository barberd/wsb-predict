It\u2019s really easy to look at numbers and say, there\u2019s no fucking way this market makes sense. And from the perspective of someone trading a couple decades ago you\u2019d be right. \n\nHowever, we trade in a post fundamentals market. Infinite QE means more than EPS.\n\nSure, covid could spook the market, but the reality is there\u2019s nowhere else for the money to go, and things are going to trend up closer and closer to ATH, with lots of random as fuck corrections down. (Kang gang)\n\nNow. If you STILL won\u2019t just buy fucking calls, here\u2019s a way to make money in a bull market as a faggot. \n\nPick a call with a strike far enough OTM and with a short enough DTE that you can comfortably expect it to expire worthless. \n\nSell that shit. \n\nUsing the same expiration and underlying, pick another call one, two, or three strikes higher depending on your risk tolerance. \n\nBuy that shit. \n\nYou\u2019ve just sold your first bear credit spread, congrats! \n\nRemember not to hold this shit to expiration. Sell on a correction down, or after a period of sideways trading to lock in your theta gains. \n\nThe best part of this trade is that you\u2019re actively targeting the bullish pigs. Be the slaughterer, not the slaughteree. \n\nThere\u2019s flexibility here too. If you swing both ways (and you should) you can buy back the strike you sold after a correction down, closing the short position of the trade and leaving the long position open. \n\nIf kang gang shows up your hedge will rebound to increase profits. \n\nIf you need more info than this research bear credit spreads.", "created_utc": 1592431340.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hb17vk/how_to_stop_getting_fucked_by_bulls/", "is_self": true}
