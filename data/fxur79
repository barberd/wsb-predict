Nothing serious, though death rates from everything ranging from pneumonia to heart disease miraculously drop while bat soup death's rise... ok.\n\n2) US Government, ignoring the constitution, shuts down small businesses and quarantines us into our homes in an unprecedented act of authoritarianism because of beer virus.\n\n3) Overwhelming fear takes over and the markets crash, as it should since unemployment begins to sky rocket and people didn't even know the government US government could be so Chinese.\n\n4) People who I used to think were intelligent but who are actually retarded apparently, like myself, decide to short the market or at least hold cash and buy in cheaper.\n\n5) The FED decides to print 5+ trillion dollars anytime the market begins to dip, and has openly stated that they will not allow the economy to go down.\n\n6) The formerly smart but actually retards who shorted get massively BTFO for thinking that insanely high levels of unemployment, and the permanent closure of 43% of small businesses might effect the economy negatively. Everything moons.\n\n7) Those who are holding cash get rekt due to hyper inflation, FORCING them to invest their money into this bullshit rigged system or see their money drop in value every day.\n\nHere's the fun part which hasn't happened yet\n\n8) Once the middle class has been sucked into this gay retarded Ponzi scheme through the threat of hyperinflation of their currency... the FED takes their finger off the printing press and the economy goes boom. Congrats, there are only the ultra wealthy and peasants now.
