{"id": "gm7vjo", "title": "Marvell Technology Group - (superheroes not included)", "selftext": "I wanted to get this out relatively early so you guys could play the run up to earnings 5/28, once again feel free to criticise any mistakes I make in this DD and do some research of your own too.\n\n**Intro**\n\nMarvell Technology Group ([$MRVL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MRVL) pretty cool ticker imo) is a semiconductor company that provides storage, network infrastructure and wireless connectivity solutions. From their website they \"transform the enterprise, cloud, automotive, industrial and consumer markets.\" They create products for a number of applications, however somewhat significantly their client base aren't consumers so they would have likely been less affected by people reducing spending due to job losses, etc. \n\n**Products and Services**\n\nTheir products include: car technology, custom ASICs, Ethernet adaptors and controllers, fibre channel adaptors and controllers, PHY transceivers and ethernet switching. Now I'm not gonna pretend I know what any of that stuff is (apart from the car tech), but some of the more notable products they provide are:\n\n* Infrastructure processors - which are used in 5G base stations among other things.\n* Security processors - \"enable best-in-class scalable network data encryption performance for...cloud environments\"\n* Server processors - used for \"mainstream cloud and high performance compute deployments\"\n* Storage- used in cloud computing and system storage products.\n\nI believe these will have been in increased demand due to the roll-out of 5G and increased popularity of cloud computing due to working from home. Additionally, Marvell is an american company, which gives it an advantage in the US 5G market as it moves to separate itself from Huawei and Chinese companies. This also shows long term value as 5G and cloud computing expand further.\n\nIn cloud computing they also provide energy efficient, fast and high performance Ethernet for cloud servers. Their NVMe controllers \"make it possible for data centres to share storage data to further maximise cost and performance efficiencies.\" \n\n**Notable Partnerships**\n\nMarvell was chosen by Nokia to help the company improve its [5G infrastructure](https://www.marvell.com/company/newsroom/nokia-and-marvell-enter-into-partnership-on-silicon-technology-for-5g.html) in March, which suggests there could be a big deal between the companies, offering Marvell a sizeable income stream for Q1. \n\nThey also have a continuing partnership with Samsung, producing the Octeon processors used in Samsungs 5G base stations. This is also a potentially lucrative deal to have as 5G is established further.\n\n**Financials**\n\nAs I said in my last post, I am far from being a qualified accountant, so if anyone else wants to look at the quarterly reports and correct me then I will link them [here](https://investor.marvell.com/financial-information/quarterly-results),  however, from what I can see their statement seems strong.\n\n**Q4 2020**\n\n[Q4 2020 report -  looks good, cash provides them with nice amount of liquidity atm](https://preview.redd.it/rvmqwg0rkkz41.png?width=943&format=png&auto=webp&s=08650144a4eddf9f59b6e63e891f4cd30c73a5d9)\n\n**Q1 2021 Guidance**\n\n[According to report this is adjusted for effects of coronavirus.](https://preview.redd.it/4xlrb4mblkz41.png?width=757&format=png&auto=webp&s=a12a2adcd27244caf82810757d2353aa9d69daf1)\n\n \"Marvell delivered fourth quarter revenue above the mid-point of guidance with solid results from both our networking and storage businesses. Our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 reflects the reduction of approximately 5 percent of revenue to account for coronavirus impacts we are aware of so far,\" said Matt Murphy, Marvell's President and CEO. \n\nHe also mentions developing multiple generations of 5G with Nokia and long-term collaboration with Samsung. The guidance is also stated to take into account COVID and the US government export restriction on certain Chinese customers. The wide guidance range on revenue also reflects COVID uncertainty. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nMostly, I'm concerned about the GAAP diluted loss per share, although if that is negligible or unlikely to affect stock price/valuation I can see Marvell doing well in the run up to earnings as it is a strong company and appears to be delivering value both now and even more in the future.\n\nFeel free to leave feedback and give your own opinion, as well as correct me on any mistakes or give advice on their  [financials](https://investor.marvell.com/financial-information/quarterly-results).\n\n**This is only my opinion I am not qualified to tell you how to allocate your money - and you should really be worried if you need someone on reddit to tell you that.**", "created_utc": 1589828843.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gm7vjo/marvell_technology_group_superheroes_not_included/", "is_self": true}
