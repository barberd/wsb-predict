I\u2019m born and raised here and i guess it\u2019s the culture of not giving a fuck about anything which i adopted as well but is very selfish. I just went for a morning run and there\u2019s over 300 people by the park having their own little picnics. This isn\u2019t just one park, i went to other parks and i went to the pier and it\u2019s the same shit... \ni wanted to see if it was the same in Long Island and upstate, so i drove there and it was to a lesser degree, but i saw a ton of kids and parents taking advantage of this coronavirus situation as a vacation. We are fucked. Kinda feel bad for Cuomo because he\u2019s been addressing the situation quite well. \n\nTLDR: spy 195p 5/1 \nNY is fucked", "created_utc": 1585071695.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fo9cks/did_a_little_dd_on_new_york/", "is_self": true}
