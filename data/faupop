Situation looking dire, cash is now only 4.5% of levered exposure and only 3.1% of the total exposure.\n\nMeanwhile, stock to cash held has increased from 253.66% on 2/19, 428.75% on 2/25 to a whopping 950% yesterday.\n\nThe swap notional value is $9b as of yesterday's close. Unfortunately for them, the price they got on these swaps was 8436.67 at thminutese moment they rolled, but tanked even further in the last seconds into close. NQ futures currently have it at \\~8310. Only about $50m worth of futures contracts left, so this thing will have to start puking stocks today, and it won't be pretty.\n\nUpdated values:\n\n|TQQQ|2/19|2/21|2/24|2/27|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Levered Exposure|13,573,106,171|12,520,585,402|11,109,556,922|8,959,186,715|\n|Total Long Exposure|17,835,985,157|16,787,444,897|15,221,033,186|12,819,404,282|\n|Cash|1,680,501,669|1,327,634,666|958,938,281|406,387,283|\n|Stock|4,262,878,986|4,266,859,496|4,111,476,264|3,860,217,567|\n|Cash / LEVEX ratio|12.38%|10.60%|8.63%|4.5%|\n|Cash / Total exposure|9.42%|7.90%|6.30%|3.1%|\n|Stock / Cash Ratio|253.66%|321.38%|428.75%|949.88%|\n\nAgain, this is not investment advice.
