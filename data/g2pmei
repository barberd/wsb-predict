I could talk about fundamentals all day but at the end of the day I see quarantine continuing at least for 2 months and social distancing for over a year. Vaccines in development are the reason for this rally but a 20%+ return in the past few weeks Is not justified. I\u2019m puttin my last 3k in $TVIX, $SH, and $SQQQ.
