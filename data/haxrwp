{"id": "haxrwp", "title": "NetApp to the moon with coming narrative shift", "selftext": "I work in the cloud industry. There is a company called \u201cSpot\u201d that was just acquired by NetApp. I think Spot updated their landing page today (I am a user of Spot\u2019s service). Spot manages servers for their customers in what I consider a unique way. They use their customer\u2019s credentials to manage servers in their customer\u2019s clouds (i.e. I give Spot my password and they access my cloud to do stuff), then charge the customer a percentage of the savings. I am very impressed with this business model and technology because Spot does not pay for the underlying infrastructure, but they get to charge around half of what is paid by the user to the cloud provider. They achieve savings for the user by managing the servers automatically better than the user can. Meanwhile, the cloud providers do not have an incentive to help customers save money on infrastructure.\n\nI expect it is very high margin to be managing other people's infra and get paid approximately half of what AWS or GCP gets paid on the same infra. The customer is happy to save and the cloud provider is happy to get paid. In Michael Scott terminology, this is a win-win-win. I know from industry experience that Fortune 500 companies that NetApp already has penetrated are extremely eager for leverage in vendor negotiations with cloud providers. I estimate that NetApp + Spot are well positioned with NetApp's existing partnerships to sell to directors and VPs of existing fortune 500 customers - customers who are desperately seeking some kind of multi-cloud story (for vendor negotiation) and cost reduction (for exploding cloud costs). NetApp is already a trusted partner. At least at where I worked, NetApp was known as a favorite vendor because of the excellent customer experience. They proactively send engineers to replace failed hard drives by monitoring remotely for failed drives. In this way, they are already known for \"self-driving infrastructure\". Since they now have both existing customer relationships and now a new multi-cloud story, I am bullish on NetApp stock on account of \\~50% down from ATH under the narrative of on-prem storage becoming legacy. Also, they have a relatively low P/E. Revenue is $ 6.15 B, and the market cap is $ 9.6 B. They seem to have good margins already, Gross Margin (TTM) at 67%. Yield at 4.33%. I think a narrative shift from legacy, on-prem solution vendor to a growth stock with a narrative like \u2018trusted vendor for cloud success\u2019 will have an enormous impact on stock price.\n\nOf course I have no idea what I'm doing, and I am very risk tolerant so make your own decisions.\n\nTLDR: customer relationships of NetApp could be undervalued, and a narrative shift to a growth company could result in a price surge  \n\n\nEDIT: my position is I bought shares", "created_utc": 1592420565.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/haxrwp/netapp_to_the_moon_with_coming_narrative_shift/", "is_self": true}
