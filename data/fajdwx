This morning I wanted to double down and bought CCL 03/20 $31P and noticed that that option did not move as much as the $30P. I've noticed the same trend between RCL $90P and $91P for 02/28. \n\nAfter doing some research I found that all of them had high IV, but the ones not moving fast(er) had low \"Open Interest\" or OI.\n\nThis begs the question: How do y'all decide which price point to trade for a PUT/CALL? Is OI that critical of a metric? What am I missing?", "created_utc": 1582839278, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fajdwx/not_all_options_are_created_equal/", "is_self": true}
