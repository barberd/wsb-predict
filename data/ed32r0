So pretty much they have until the 27th to rule on it, so the option chain is showing a lot of implied volatility which to me means FAT PREMIUMS. So I was wondering, the share price is 12.75 and If I sell a 1 call for net +$1145 and a $22 put for net +$1095 WHILE LONG 100 shares of the stock itself at 12.75 per share, according to my modeling excel sheet, theres no way I could lose money on this trade (which seems incorrect).  Can someone please explain this to me?  What am I missing?  My autism is having a major flare up.
