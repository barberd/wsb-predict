Most of those days were over 3x the average, some well over that.  As more posts were made, volume went up.  \n\nSchaeffer research announced 15 days ago that calls:puts were being traded at a 6:1 ratio.  Brokers were likely hedging out their open option positions by purchasing the underlying stock, as evidenced by a daily minimum of 20m in volume.  \n\nWhile it doesn\u2019t show direct causation, there is a correlation to the number of SPCE posts (primarily regarding calls) over the past month and the volume of it.  More people buying calls, more brokers buying stock, increasing the price, shorts covering their positions during the squeeze, and the cycle continuing.\n\n[Shoutout to this bear post 2 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e8ugkb/reiterating_the_spce_short_thesis/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)", "created_utc": 1582745037, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9yl3t/wsb_and_those_who_monitor_it_are_the_primary/", "is_self": true}
