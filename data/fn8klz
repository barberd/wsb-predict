I have been pressing them both over the past few weeks to move out of equities in to a money market. Wait it out and reassess in June. Neither know each other and both responded, \"I have a broker than I trust and have been told to stay in the market\".  The Aunt told me \"our guy is buying up cheap good stock so my fingers are crossed\". Neither wants to have a conversation why this might not make sense. I have asked to chat with each of their financial \"advisors\". Both are successful individuals that are now retired. Scary to think how many more accounts like this exist and will begin to sell off as we progress.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: The downside risk in equities in the next 3 months is much higher than the upside potential. I havent found one economist or bank that is bullish over the next 3 months.", "created_utc": 1584915941.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fn8klz/those_6040_mutual_fund_holders/", "is_self": true}
