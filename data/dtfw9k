{"id": "dtfw9k", "title": "High leverage opportunities", "selftext": "With RH shutting down the infinite leverage trick, I figured I'd share a simple way to leverage up to your PRT, that's endorsed by the SEC!  2 words... Futures Trading.  For example... if you look at the [Day Trade Margin](https://www.discounttrading.com/margin.html) requirments, 1 ES contract requires $500 margin to hold a position.  But 1 ES contract represents 50x leverage to SPX (when SPX moves $1, the ES contract changes by $50).  So... 50x$3000 is $150,000.  $150,000/$500 is 300x leverage.  Boom!\n\nYou can also trade things like oil (CL).  1 Contract is for 1000 barrels of oil.  At ~$55/barrel, that means your 1 contract is for $55,000.  Margin requirements are $1000 for day trade, so that's 55x leverage.\n\nOr 2 year treasury bonds (ZT).  1 Contract is for $200,000 of bonds, and only requires $300 day trade margin, for a leverage of 666.67x!\n\nUsing this one simple trick called futures trading, you can lose money as fast as you like, right up to your PRT!", "created_utc": 1573222013, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dtfw9k/high_leverage_opportunities/", "is_self": true}
