How does that make you feel? Stressed out? Do you know what people do when they're stressed and poor? They eat fast food.\n\nI've been on the lookout for stocks that dropped with the crash but really shouldn't have. Wall street retards were panicking and selling everything at the same time. You know what they shouldn't have sold? Motherfucking potatoes. Hear me out.\n\n* potatoes are by far the most profitable food, they have the highest profit margin of anything\n* if the market recovers, restaurants will go up, potatoes go up\n* if the market drops, everyone except fast food will go out of business, they're the largest purchasers of potatoes, potatoes go up\n* if we enter a depression, all we'll be able to afford is potatoes, potatoes go up\n* every restaurant will make their menu have the best possible margins if they want to survive, which means potatoes go up\n* massively OTM calls on potatoes are cheap as fuck\n\nThere's no future without potatoes. A day without a potato is like a day without sunshine. The stock is LW. Biggest supplier of potatoes. It's going to hit $85 by August 21st. If it doesn't I'll double penetrate myself with sharpies. I'll probably do that anyways.\n\nSo click the \"select\" button in robinhood which makes all the little checkboxes appear. Buy a call for October 16th, strike price 85. Sell a call for August 21st, strike price 85. I've done all the math and technical shit with charts and lines and I squiggled dry erase markers on a window for like three hours but I'm not gonna get into the details because they're boring. But this strategy has 10x upside and zero downside. Worst case you end up at only 250%, jerking off to a picture of like six neon green sharpies inside of me, wondering what would've happened if you had doubled down on SPY 300 calls expiring 45 seconds after market open.\n\nhere's proof that I'm an experienced trader with over 30 days of experience:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mjnnpzf575s41.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0e9e3e9e4ce193900173764b2e6f6c57884327b\n\ntl;dr: buy LW 85C 10/16, sell LW 85C 8/21", "created_utc": 1586590907.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fyzbkp/how_to_make_free_money_on_potatoes/", "is_self": true}
