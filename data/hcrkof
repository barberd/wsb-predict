They've pulled everything trick in the book and played about every card there is possible to play to prop this juggernaut up and my question is ... How many more bullets are left in the gun? I really don't see anymore big time announcements coming to soften the blow of this. The economy is in the dumps, retails, bars, restaurants, energy and just about every other thing that makes up a vast percentage of the GDP is suffering.... Horribly... So my question is what am I missing? What will there next big bandaid announcement be and where do you see things going from here? I don't know what else they can do or say, the measures taken are good but can't simply carry on forever in place of commerce..
