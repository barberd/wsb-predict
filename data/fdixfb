Your wife has come home with a new boyfriend. With the S&amp;P closing near the intraday high, you relax into your chair because all is right in the world. After the new boyfriend finishes with your wife, its your bedtime. Generously, the new boyfriend left a pillow out for you on the couch. You relax onto the wet pillow and fall asleep to a familiar smell. \n\nSuddenly, you spring awake. The boyfriend is watching TV at 2 A.M. He looks over at you, \"You know, I really came here for you.\" Confused, because no one could want you, you notice a PUT on the floor. It's a SPY 03/18 P285. It's at this moment you realize something is wrong. You can't tell what, but you begin to hear a zipper unzip. And just like that, a \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b  jumps out of the boyfriend bull (BB) costume. Your sobs are met with satisfaction on your wife's face. \n\nThe next morning, you start to feel the tell-tale itch of Covid-19. You get a later start than usual, but you make it to the computer screen. Kneeling in front of the computer, for obvious reasons, you notice the S&amp;P E-minis are down 5% on heavy volume. You say to yourself, \"But, It was all priced in.\"\n\nTL;DR Bulls gon get effed.", "created_utc": 1583352765, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fdixfb/the_bull_life_right_now/", "is_self": true}
