I want to lock profits on this, and what I've read is saying I should sell the $46 put which is farther OTM. However, the $46 put is worth $0.54, less than my initial cost.  \n\n\nIf the stock increases in price, the puts will both increase in price. Is the idea that since the puts I've sold are farther OTM, they will increase less? So if I want to buy back the contracts sold, the increased cost is offset by the increased value of the original puts that I purchased?", "created_utc": 1564774096, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cl8p9i/locking_profits_by_selling_option_at_the_next/", "is_self": true}
