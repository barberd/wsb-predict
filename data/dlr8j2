Millions of non-paying customers will get access to DIS+", "selftext": "Self-explanatory. \n\nMY ASSUMPTION is that their subscriber forecasts are low enough to warrant a giveaway freebie to bougie ass VZ users. \n\nMy THOUGHTS are they are cutting into a big market of people who would've already subscribed to DIS+ vs the poor T-Mobile/Cricket customers. \n\nWITH MY LIMITED UNDERSTANDING OF ANYTHING AT ALL RELATED TO BUSINESS, I have no idea who is getting money out of the deal, VZ or DIS, or if they're just like, \"hey scratch my back and I'll scratch yours.\" Either way, DIS+ is gonna be servicing a bunch of people who aren't even paying them.\n\nMY PERSONAL OPINION: $DIS is gonna shit the bed and drop back down to pre-DIS+ announcement levels for Q3 through Q4. Q3 will have decent ER but poor guidance that they will blame economic uncertainty for. They'll drum up Q3 DIS+ expected subscribers using newly promised VZ users and say they're gonna cash in big time. Once Q4 earnings hit, they'll shit the bed and fall down into $100's again like they were before. This might be the time when the economy as a whole takes a big ol' poopoo too though.\n\nI'm gonna skip Q3 ER play and wait for Q4 ER in 2020.
