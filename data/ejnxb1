Scrappy, well-drilled squad at home, it\u2019s a tougher matchup than people think.\n\nI plan on parlaying it with the Mexican Cartels ML over the Mexican Government.\n\nThe US Military is a lot like the Cowboys. Storied history, a lot of talk from the fanbase, but hasn\u2019t won anything impressive in decades. There\u2019s talent, and the pieces seem to be there, but the front office and leadership is woefully incompetent.\n\nIran has a relationship with the US like Urban Meyer does with Michigan. Regardless of whatever else they\u2019re facing for that week, Urban was always gameplanning for Michigan, and Iran is always gameplanning for the US.\n\nEdit: As for prop bets, I like Iran to shoot down over 35 fixed-wing aircraft (-114) and sink 10,000 tonnes of ships (+125).
