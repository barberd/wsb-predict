This is a purely intuitive play, as these companies are usually Titans in their industries. Based on what we\u2019re seeing in the industry, now is a good time to get bearish on these.  \n\nAAL $10 put 1/15/21 (shorter term if you want, but I think this will last through 2021):\n-recently took out massive loan to try and survive (desperate)\n-declares full flights (desperation for revenue, and no one will want to book to be on a full flight in a pandemic + no money for travel now)\n-COVID spikes like CRAZY \n-travel ban to Europe/South America \n-RV sales up show huge trend in different travel/vacation methods \n- Airlines just reported that they expect at least 25% decrease in travelers through 2021\n- bankruptcy rumors \n- Warren buffet \n\n\nMGM: \n- massive COVID spike in state\n- worker at casino just died from COVID \n- rumors union will sue\n- rumors of another lockdown\n- limited tourism will cost them\n- huge overhead to stay open, while limiting number of players at each table for social distancing (half)\n- making revenue substantially slower, while still bearing full costs. Not profitable for a long time coming. They will have to shut down to save the business due to overhead and employee complaints. They won\u2019t want to be seen as \u201cpolitically incorrect\u201d either due to fear of also being \u201cboycotted\u201d \n\n\nThe \u201ccourt of public opinion\u201d aka social media is a powerful tool right now. Companies will listen to it. Important to Take that into account when making decisions, IMO \n\n\nGood luck!!\n\n\n\nEdit: now I understand there has already been approximately 65% downside in casinos for example, but I believe there is still much more room to go. Just like FASTY still has upside. Can\u2019t stop momentum and fear.", "created_utc": 1593370659.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hhk3j6/puts_on_airlines_and_casinos_coming_right_up/", "is_self": true}
