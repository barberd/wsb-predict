I was astounded at how many comments/messages I got with simple questions. I will hit the high points, then answer any specific questions in the comments or feel free to PM.\n\nDisclaimer: This is the US tax system. I don't know shit about foreign (to the US)  tax.\n\n\\-IF YOU PRESS THE SELL BUTTON AND IT SELLS AT A PROFIT, YOU OWE TAXES. I seen way too many people thinking they didn't owe taxes because they didn't \"withdraw\" their funds.\n\n\\-YOUR BROKER SENDS A CONSOLIDATED 1099 TO YOU AND THE IRS THAT LISTS EVERY TRADE YOU MADE. Robin hood is a broker. This will be sent to you and the IRS by January 31st following the tax year the transaction takes place. Some times this only includes your sales price, not loses. That depends on the situation. Some people on here will receive a book.\n\n\\-THESE ARE SHORT TERM CAPITAL GAINS. That means you pay your [marginal tax rate](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/06/tax-rates-and-income-brackets-for-2020.html) of your [adjusted gross income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/agi.asp).\n\n\\-I can't believe I had to put this. IF YOU OPENED AN ACCOUNT IN YOUR PARENT'S NAME, YOUR PARENTS WILL RECEIVE A CONSOLIDATED 1099 OF  ALL YOUR TRADES AND HAVE TO PAY TAXES ON YOUR GAINS ON THEIR TAX RETURN.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: CSV $20 Call 04/17, don't steal your parents identity or spend your gains without thinking of the tax repercussions.", "created_utc": 1584502952.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkj41g/you_dumb_fucks_dont_know_about_taxes_read_this/", "is_self": true}
