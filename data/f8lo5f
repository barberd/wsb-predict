Fine, whatever. \n\nThat said, the real problem isn't the virus, it's the people afraid of the virus. They have lost the way. \n\nWe all know that stocks ONLY go up. It's a fact. But the evil bear gang has instilled fear into the souls of otherwise brave men, eroding their confidence over time.\n\nIf we want to defeat the bears, the solution is very simple - we need to send some of our incredible bull gang energy to our vulnerable brothers in arms, those weakened by the bear gang propaganda.\n\n***Here's the plan:*** at market open tomorrow, those bulls brave enough to expend their energy to save the market must leave their homes, and stand in the middle of their street, arms outstretched to the sky like Goku summoning a spirit bomb. Scream \"GREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN\" at the top of your lungs. If you live on the West Coast this may wake your neighbors, when they check out what's going on, recruit them to your cause, they will understand.\n\nIf enough of us do this, our weaker bull gang comrades will hear our cries, and because of our sacrifice develop hands of diamond, and hearts of gold. The bears will return to hibernation and the margin calls from whence they came.\n\nIt won't be easy, but we can do this. Good luck, we're all counting on you.", "created_utc": 1582517807, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f8lo5f/its_not_too_late_we_can_save_the_market/", "is_self": true}
