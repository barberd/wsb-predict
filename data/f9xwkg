Bayer AG, ticker symbol $BAYRY, is in a unique position to profit from a mass panic.\n\nIf people panic over a perceived disaster, real or not, they tend to irrationally stockpile goods they think they'll need.\n\nNaturally this includes OTC medicines and canned goods. Bayer produces Aspirin among other common drugs. As this health scare progresses, pharmacies will sell out of Aspirin in hours. I expect a massive temporary leap in profits from Bayer's pharma arm.\n\nA few years ago, Bayer bought out Monsanto, one of the world's biggest producers of genetically modified crops. In the next few weeks, grocery stores will move millions of cans of fruits and vegetables.\n\nBayer could very possibly go up in the next week, and even if they don't, they'll have a stellar earnings report for this quarter.\n\nI've bought shares outright, but I expect that 20$ calls dated for 3-4 months out should be gold.", "created_utc": 1582742486, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9xwkg/bayry_is_going_to_make_big_gains_as_long_as/", "is_self": true}
