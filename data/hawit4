First DD of many here... $TDG Trasdigm time", "selftext": "TL;DR Buy TDG stock.\n\nFirst off, yeah i know, the options volume is basically nothing so mostly a stock play, unless enough of you autists create a market for this.\n\nTransdigm (pronounced Trans-DIME) is a broad supplier of airplane components and parts. Virtually all military and commercial aircraft have parts made by TDG. By nature of being in the aerospace industry, their business is hard to mimic, and over 90% of their parts are patented, and they are the sole provider of 80% of those. To you retards, this means their business is hard to replicate, every plane needs them, and on top of it, their management team has been expanding their non-aerospace business to diversify as well because their are bad-asses who happen to grow Revenue, EV, and operating income BIGLY year after year.\n\nSome numbers...\n\n2017 Operating income: 1.483B      16.97% MORE  than 2016\n\n2018 Operating income: 1.655B      11.64% MORE  than 2017\n\n2019 Operating income: 1.927B      16.97% MORE  than 2018\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2017 Revenue: 3.504B      10.5% MORE  than 2016\n\n2017 Revenue: 3.811B      8.76% MORE  than 2017\n\n2017 Revenue: 5.223B      37.05% MORE  than 2018\n\nOK that's decent. So management has their heads on straight it seems, they have proprietary products that are used in everything, but what else?\n\nTheir aftermarket business of selling replacement parts to owners of aircraft is highly profitable. Remember AZO and ORLY? They fell until everyone realized people now have time to work on their cars, and when cars sit, batteries die and other things go wrong(I literally went into an ORLY to get a new battery  last month because of this). Also, people aren't buying new cars so the car parts stores profit from that.\n\nNow think Airplanes. People are cooped up and so they take their old airplane out for a spin that's been sitting at the hangar and finally get around to fixing it up. What about all the planes sitting on the runways? Things break, so parts will be needed even tho Boeing might not make as many planes.\n\nObviously shares took a hit with air travel slowing, but this is a temporary lowering of Transdigm's revenue. I am happy to throw tendies at a company with good management, has a much needed product in an industry with lots of room for recovery. If you have been getting FOMO with airlines but don't wanna mess with that risk, here is a potential solution.\n\nMy positions: 250 shares of TDG at an average cost of $365.10.\n\nI woulda told y'all sooner, but the 30-day rule for posting cost y'all the tendies. If you wanna call bullshit ask /u/lurkingsince2006, who I tried to tell about it in a private chat since he earned me so many tendies on PRPL.\n\nEDIT: Anyone like Insider Buying? Robert Small is a director and threw in about $250M mid May. That puts his stake at like $900M last time I did the math. His net worth is around $1.4B, so the dude knows something. \n\nDisclaimer: I don't know you or anything about you and your risk tolerance, call you financial advisor before you take a strangers advice on the internet. Or you can YOLO too, whatever.", "created_utc": 1592416916.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hawit4/account_finally_old_enough_to_post_first_dd_of/", "is_self": true}
