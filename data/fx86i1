I understand what happened with Jartek and the mods last night but today the sub seems completely restored to its past glory. Over the past few weeks, 90% of posts haven\u2019t been retarded; just straight stupid and pointless. Even on the occasional decent post all of the comments were completely unoriginal and stupid (insert- positions/ban). I had a feeling that most of the people commenting/posting didn\u2019t even trade but just found this sub from r/all and wanted to \u201cget in on the fun\u201d of the subs autistic culture. What caused those fucktards to finally leave us alone? Was it a conspiracy created by Jartek to use an influx of shit posts to destroy this sub, take away all we love and sell us his scams?\n\nTLDR- Is this sub finally back to normal and what caused it? Positions 4/24 SPCE 10p, 5/15 MSFT 200c, 4/24 IWM 75p (lots of bag holding).
