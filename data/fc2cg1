{"id": "fc2cg1", "title": "Coronavirus is here, and the Government is doing nothing to stop it.", "selftext": "I am a 24 year old male that has just gone through the 'screening' process in Portland, Oregon for Coronavirus. Notably, Portland is home to one of the first community transfers in the United States. The day before yesterday I started to feel ill, I stayed up all night sweating, excreting, and coughing. The next morning I had chills all day. Cue day two, symptoms present, and I feel a little breathless. I call into the hospital asking about antivirals, and I describe my symptoms, and she responds that in regards to the current OUTBREAK that screening needs to be set up first. I am told I will recieve a call in 30-60 minutes. \n\nCalling it outbreak, they know that its here. They know theyre not ready for it. \n\n23 minutes later I receive another call where I describe my symptoms, tell them about my girlfriend who got back from Africa a month ago, and was so breathless two weeks ago her lips turned blue. They then tell me, that they will have to set up a video call with me. \n\n10 minutes later there is another call. I am told to follow a weblink and click on the nice man holding a phone with a doctor in it. I follow instructions and half an hour later Im on video call with a young man in his mid thirties. \n\nThis is where it gets interesting. He has me describe my symptoms, my girlfriend and her experience, which fit closely with Coronavirus, and then he asks two questions. \n\n1. ) have you traveled abroad withing 14 DAYS - No\n\n2.) have you had contact with someone who has tested positive? - No\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell then I am sorry we are not going to test you. You are going to just have to stay home, drink lots of fluids and rest. (i.e.) Fuck off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI asked why that was all that they were basing their criteria on, and he said that was the CDC and Oregon's guidelines for testing. Thats it. If youve been out of the country within 14 days, when it takes at least that long if not longer to incubate. And if you have ever been in contact with anyone that has tested positive. BUT HOW WOULD I HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH SOMEONE WHO TESTED POSITIVE IF THEY NEVER TEST. \n\nI sit here breathless writing this up, and frankly, I am amazed they are so willing to cover up the fact that the Coronavirus is already here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote, I never once in this entire story identified myself as someone who had coronavirus. Everyone on the phone just assumed as they passed me along. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Local hospitals wont even test someone who has all the symptoms of coronavirus, and has come in contact with someone coming off of international travel who also showed symptoms of coronavirus.
