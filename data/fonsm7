Finally, his friends tell him to go see the doctor. He does, but he is not able to resolve his issue. Then he goes to another one. And another one yet, to no avail. Desperate, he tries one more doctor but this time he prescribes him some strong meds. After some time, he meets a friend and greets him:\n\" Heeey you look quite happy today, did you solve that shitting problem?\"\nAnd he answers extremely happy:\n\"NO, BUT I DON'T GIVE A FUCK ANYMOOOOOORE\"", "created_utc": 1585130732.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fonsm7/what_is_happening_now_is_like_a_old_joke_my/", "is_self": true}
