{"id": "eyfjbp", "title": "Why is Tesla up so much? How you can still make money. A story of Chinese investors.", "selftext": "Why is Tesla up a ridiculous 20% and still rising after hours on basically no news today?\n\nMy theory: Chinese investors have little to no faith in their own markets after coronavirus shut down their country. The first day their markets re-open, they drop to the government sanctioned -7.5%. Markets are likely to tank further as money that couldn't get out yesterday leaves and Xi QE dwindles.\n\nWhat would you autists do if you were now sitting on a negative return investment? Sit on it? Put it back into the Chinese market? No; obviously try to recoup your gains in the most pumped bull market in recent memory. Chinese investors will flock to the most promising and recognizable companies and figures in the American industry. Chinese investors aren't stupid, they recognize the demise of fossil fuels and the rise of electric vehicles. Chinese money will continue to leave their markets and invest in TESLA.\n\nChina has 1.3 Billion people. USA has 365 Mil. Even if percentage wise less Chinese people are involved in the stock market there are likely just as many or even more autists over there FOMO'ing into Tesla\n\nTesla goes to moon as long as Chinese markets keep tanking.\n\nOther recognizable American companies in China that aren't China-manufacturing-based or Retail-based could benefit.", "created_utc": 1580769835, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eyfjbp/why_is_tesla_up_so_much_how_you_can_still_make/", "is_self": true}
