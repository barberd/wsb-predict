{"id": "g371n1", "title": "Why Zillow ($Z) is going to drill in the next few months and why you should buy when it does", "selftext": "A little DD on $Z for you all. As we all know, despite the stock market mooning the real economy is not doing so well. $Z operates within the residential housing market and has three segments: \n\n\\- Homes: Zillow buys and resell homes. This is a new segment they started in Q4 2018\n\n\\- IMT: Primarily advertising revenue from agents and rentals\n\n\\- Mortgages: Advertising sold to mortgage lenders/professionals\n\nOk now that you understand the business lets get down to the fundamentals. Lets start with the pros: \n\n* **Strong liquidity:** Zillow has a fuck ton of cash and they aren't going bankrupt. Lets juts get that out of the way. As of Feb 29, 2020 the company has $2.5 billion in cash and short term investments (mostly government bonds). Against these liquid assets they have liabilities totaling $2.5 billion comprising of $563 million in loans against their inventory of homes and $2 billion of corporate debt. The corporate debt holds a relatively low interest rate (\\~1.75%), is convertible to equity (means they arent forced to pay it back in cash if they don't want to), and only $460 million of this corporate debt is due by 2021 with the rest due much later(no imminent refinancing needs).\n* **Strong management team:** Zillow's CEO Rich Barton knows what the fuck he is doing and has experience leading in a crisis that is going to fuck over his industry. He founded Expedia and led it not only through the 08 crisis but also 9/11 when everyone thought travel was dead forever\n\nOk now on to the cons and why I believe this stock has a long way to fall\n\n* **Terrible Industry Fundamentals:** Housing is extremely cyclical and will fall drastically in a recession scenario. If you all think people will buy less iphones in a recession just imagine how many fewer houses will be bought. Zillow thrives in a market where there are lots of transactions since they make most of their money on advertising sales. No transactions = no advertising. Housing will be a lagging indicator here as it will take more time to see the full effects of the recession within the housing market. On the most recent investor call the CEO actually affirmed their Q1 guidance. He did say that the market did not start seeing any sort of changes in buyer/seller behavior until March 15 and later so they will only have 2 weeks of downside data in their next earnings. The CEO did also mention however that they saw up to a 49% decline in website visits in shelter-in-place markets. Zillow themselves have also said they will put a hold on buying new houses. \n* **High level of unprofitable homes inventory remaining:** As I mentioned earlier Zillow began their new homes segment late 2018. Rather than just acting as a middleman, Zillow is not in the business of taking ownership of and selling homes directly. The past 2 years have been some of the  best years for the housing market with home prices getting extended to relative levels not seen since the 2008 crisis. Zillow has been buying homes during this entire time. As of March 2020, Zillow has 1,859 remaining homes on their balance sheet totaling about $645 million in value. Now lets dig into the profitability of these homes. According to the company's 10K, Zillow sold $1.4 billion worth of homes in 2019. However, the gross margin was only 3.6%. So in the best housing market in over 10 years the company eeked out 3.6% before any sales/marketing, development, or other administrative costs. On an EBITDA (proxy for profitability/cash flow) basis the homes segment generated **negative** $241 million. We would expect negative profitability for a new segment such as this because of the new costs behind the scenes to set up this program but it shows that the segment is already unprofitable. Now what do you guys expect will happen to the selling prices of the remaining 1,859 homes? During what period of the cycle were they purchased? Now you have your answer to the profitability.\n\nLets talk timing. The company's Q1 earnings report is May 15. Management held a conference call on March 23 where they reaffirmed Q1 guidance but pulled full year guidance. So there will be no surprises here and I don't expect the stock to move much due to earnings. Q2 earnings will be a different story and I expect them to post historically bad earnings at least Q2 and Q3 and likely longer. \n\nAll this being said I still believe in the company long term. Crisis' often accelerate trends and Zillow is the leader in the shift towards a more digitized home buying and selling experience. On top of that they have a great management team and no bankruptcy risk. The good news for us is that Wall Street often does not think in the long term view and shits its pants each quarter due to earnings. I expect a significant retrace in Zillows stock price in the next 3-5 months. If it does get down to the sub $20's again I recommend buying leaps or boring old stocks.\n\nTLDR: Z 8/21 30P", "created_utc": 1587146385.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g371n1/why_zillow_z_is_going_to_drill_in_the_next_few/", "is_self": true}
