This is starting to get really fucking serious. \n\nTSLA has been a bellwether for market sentiment through this entire market run up, and if it breaks, it will spell much worse things not only for TSLA, but I believe the entire market.\n\nWhere is that breaking point? We are at an absolutely critical juncture. \n\n [https://i.imgur.com/f9hIoNv.png](https://i.imgur.com/f9hIoNv.png) \n\nIf $648 doesn't hold tomorrow, it puts the entire move from $266 in serious jeopardy.\n\nWe need to find the fortitude to hold $648 tomorrow. If not, I fear bad things ahead.\n\nGodspeed Retards\n\n**TL;DR - If TSLA doesn't hold $648 tomorrow, TSLA and the entire market could be fucked.**", "created_utc": 1582867907, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fapue2/tesla_tsla_last_stand/", "is_self": true}
