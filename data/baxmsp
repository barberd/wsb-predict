{"id": "baxmsp", "title": "$TUFN IPO April 11", "selftext": "Hello fellow spergs. \n\nI was going to write some sarcastic bs about how the tards on this sub love to flock to the meme stocks but I'll take the high road. I know, I know, I'm so respectful. You're welcome for not being patronizing/self-aggrandizing. /s\n\nTUFN is yet another Israeli (also Boston) cyber security IPO that's coming this Thursday, April 11. I'm going to be watching this IPO for a nice entry point as it looks like an IPO that's flying under the radar &amp; is priced very conservatively. Keep in mind cyber security is a market with TONS of competition &amp; I believe TUFN's growth rate has slowed. \n\nDo your own research but here's some financial info:\n\n84M TTM Rev, growing &gt;30% y/y\n71M Gross Profit, 84% gross margins\n73M OpEx\n~4.2M Net Loss/3M EBIT Loss. \n\nThe IPO midpoint priced at $13/share on ~32.5M shares which is ~423M market cap. That's a TTM 5 p/s or assuming 30% FY '19 top line growth (FY '19 revenues of 109M) a p/s of 3.9. Growth apparently is slowing right now so I'm simply watching this and hoping it sells off and there's a little liquidity in options after a couple weeks. Regardless a very conservative valuation. Also watching PagerDuty (PD) but it's valued at a 14.5 TTM P/S which seems extremely high for an IPO in a crowded space.", "created_utc": 1554749874, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/baxmsp/tufn_ipo_april_11/", "is_self": true}
