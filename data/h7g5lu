WRITE IT DOWN. write down exactly how the market could fuck you and what measures you're taking to mitigate the anal damage.\n   1. Paying a little extra for added time(reduce theta decay and give yourself some wiggle room)\n   2. What price point are you going to bail at? Not just red neither, green also.\n   3. You can buy the flipside option if its swinging wildly the other way. (form an emergency strangle)\n   4. Stay cash - no shame in watching and reassessing your approach and how strong the direction seems.\n\n3.  Set a limit for how many chips ur putting down on 1 trade, no matter how sure you are of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know it seems like common sense some of this, but im seeing more and more people married to their positions just to get burnt to ashes. \n\n**tldr: the market wont always work in your favor because you will it to. always have a plan for when it decides to fuck you.**\n\npositions: \n\nVIX 35P 11/18 \n\nVXX 50C 7/2\n\n VXX 52C 7/2\n\n MGM 18P 7/17\n\n NOK 7C 10/16\n\nSPY 400C 7/17", "created_utc": 1591946774.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h7g5lu/for_new_traders_tip_for_not_blowing_up_your/", "is_self": true}
