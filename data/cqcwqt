Get ready for some truly retarded Bear Porn Conjecture.\n\nTL;DR\n\nThe Fed is going to continue royally fucking up and is going to cause the next great stock market downturn.

I will make the case for this by outlining my thought process in five parts:\n\n\u200b\n\nTrouble brewing in the FOMC\nThe Fed has become a ticking time bomb\nThree occurrences underway\nWhat it all adds up to\nInvalidation scenarios\n\u200b\n\n1. Trouble brewing in the FOMC\n\nThe Fed is making it painfully clear that they are at best internally-divided and/or paralyzed and don\u2019t know what to do; or at worst are starting to become more hawkish. This was apparent in Powell\u2019s last press conference. Markets are freaking out with the Feds flip-flopping and obvious lack of decisiveness and direction. The Feds decisions have become too volatile and unpredictable to maintain their perceived put support for the market. The MO of being data-dependent and wait and see has gotten muddied with global weak growth factors and trade war risks. This mantra of \u2018wait and see\u2019 has mutated into just winging it. The Fed seems to want to be able to say to the market:\n\n\u201cLook, we don\u2019t think the domestic data is that bad, and we\u2019d like to hold or raise because that\u2019s what our traditional MO &amp; core dual-mandate is, but we don\u2019t want the markets to tank\u2026so here\u2019s a pity 0.25 cut k thanks fuck off\u201d.\n\nWhile the markets are trying to tell them:\n\n\u201cThat pussy 0.25 shit isn\u2019t going to cut it. We get it, but the problem is that you\u2019re living in the past. Today, in reality, you\u2019re not in charge of just the US economy like you were in the early 1900\u2019s \u2013 all central banks and thus the global economy takes its\u2019 cues from you today. This is the future. You\u2019re making hawkish decisions in the vacuum of US data, when you\u2019re really de-facto in charge of the world data; and the rest of the world\u2019s data merits nothing even close to hawkish. In fact, what we want is fast and aggressive easing \u2013 the yield gap between the rest of the world and the US is too wide and it doesn\u2019t make any fucking sense. Why would the best (US) assets in the world also give me the highest yield relative to dumpster fires like Europe? That defies the physics of finance, the equation is backwards and we\u2019re going to buy the fuck out of that opportunity. Until that yield-gap tightens, we\u2019ll just keep buying up dollars &amp; treasuries because you\u2019re literally the only game in town for us big boys in fixed income &amp; currencies. Did we also mention that we\u2019re flush with cash thanks to the global printing presses over the last decade?\u201d.\n\nThe markets had been giving clear signals that holding, let alone raising, was not what the global financial systems needed. So when Powell started beating the drums for Fed support going into the summer and advertising that the Fed also had the responsibility of doing \u201cwhatever is necessary to maintain the recovery\u201d the markets of course took that as a signal that maybe the Fed was finally listening to them; that Powell had cemented a dovish dominance over the FOMC and was ready to start an easing cycle. We know of course, that what actually ended up happening was the \u201cmid-cycle adjustment\u201d debacle that brought massive volatility back to the markets.Alright guys - get your beers cold and bongs packed because in an autistic Zerohedge style I\u2019m going to lay out my full-blown bear theory and explain in painfully long detail my thought process for why I think this may actually finally be it - the long awaited &amp; fabled stock market top and ensuing bear market that may or may not exist anymore.
