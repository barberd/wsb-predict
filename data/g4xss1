{"id": "g4xss1", "title": "Netflix Q1 Earnings Will be Negative", "selftext": "Ok boomers that buy NFXL stocks, because hurr durr people are staying home watching Netflix. Let me explain to you how technology works. You see Netflix does not make money when you stay at home and watch their movies (paradoxical I know, but true) - they make money from monthly subscriptions. You sitting on your ass all day and using their bandwidth is what is actually costing them money. And for the economically  savvy of you out there, you will notice that costing is the opposite of earning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn other words, the best circumstances for Netflix to make money would be to have you subscribed to their service and never use it, or use it sparingly. Do you honestly think that $10 is going to  pay for TBs worth of bandwidth increases per month?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNFLX May 400p\n\nt.
