I\u2019ve been long in the 12/16/22 $6 C for a few months (before the reverse split). Today, I lit up the position with more capital to average down, then 10 minutes later some big dog bought 10,000 more contracts.\n\nEarlier today, USO stated in an SEC filing they\u2019re no longer permitted to buy WTI futures contracts. \n\nThis article covers it pretty well: https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.ft.com/content/87f1e819-e041-4bc6-a57c-dfbbb8709f7d\n\n\nSo I\u2019ll ask again: do y\u2019all think it\u2019ll get liquidated, or will they find another way to buy the futures? I\u2019m a bit more concerned now.", "created_utc": 1590099127.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/go6i8b/followup_uso/", "is_self": true}
