We know this, but as a former bull turned gay bear whose asshole is still gaping from JPOWs schlong, i'm ready to come home, and I want to buy some calls. Pork processing plants have been getting ripped through by coronavirus in the past week or two, forcing shutdowns that you may or may not have heard about. Smithfield foods, the largest pork producer in the world, has shut down 5 plants in the last week or so. It is likely that the same will happen or is already happening to many other food processing plants. These plants are cold, wet, environments and the workers are in close proximity to each other: A wet dream for the WuFlu. \n\nFrom this, It seems like there could be shortages of pork as plant processing capacity is lowered. This should lead to an increase in the price of pork, and I don't see why the same wont be true for other meat products. In the past week prices have already risen.\n\nCOW is an agricultural ETF that has holdings in lean hogs, live cattle, and feeder cattle futures. As more and more plants are forced to close, the prices of these commodities should go up. If I was not so stupid I might try to play these commodity futures directly, but I don't know how and I only use robinhood like a true degenerate.\n\nThe volume on these options are very low, almost nonexistent. Which is why I bought shared on $COW. \n\n$PPC is a company involved in the production of chicken products in the US, EU and Mexico. As beef prices rise in combination with many people falling on rough times, demand for chicken, which is an inferior good, will rise. The options on PPC have higher volume, but only for certain strikes so again be careful.\n\nSomeone tell me why this is an autistic play.\n\nSources:  [https://www.newsweek.com/another-smithfield-meat-processing-plant-shuts-down-over-coronavirus-concerns-1500285](https://www.newsweek.com/another-smithfield-meat-processing-plant-shuts-down-over-coronavirus-concerns-1500285) \n\nFor the true autists:  [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inferior-good.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inferior-good.asp) \n\nTLDR; pork plants closing, supply down, price up. $COW to the moon, $PPC to mars\n\n$PPC 24C 09/18  $COW 10 shares(gay)", "created_utc": 1588101011.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9tepk/its_time_to_pig_out_on_cow/", "is_self": true}
