Once the real economic impact of this starts do you really think a single person with a brain is going to buy SPCE? or BYND? or TSLA?\n\nSure these stonks were fun to watch rocket 100% in a day but the reality is no one is going to space or getting EV credits when 10% of the population is unemployed.\n\nI'll talk specifically about $TSLA because i'm a gay bear but seriously. 300 Million of their revenue is tax credits that's their entire profit margin for the next 12 months.
