It\u2019s a different mindset for me trading options to hedge, vs spec. \nI have several brokers, but that is all on hedging. I want to make some tendies on this. \n\n\nCall me what you want but I only have done futures, I have every damn report known to man kind. But the CME is cruel on margin coverage on future options. \nI separate my spec accounts from my hedge. \n\nSoo.. give me something to get me out of the mindset of hedging. \n\nI\u2019ve done just about every option trade known, but it\u2019s all been through a broker that does the research for me. \nAny help great. \nIf not I\u2019m buying spce and amazin Calls at open.
