{"id": "cqwwlg", "title": "Am I autistic enough for this sub?", "selftext": "Ealier this year I Was looking for a new job because I got fired like a fucking idiot. I got a call from a recruiter who got me an interview at a company which I bombed in the most miserable fashion. Anyhow after I recovered some of my dignity (sort of) I decided to check and see if the company was publicly traded and found the PRED symbol at the low low price of $1.31 with news of a submitted NASDAQ uplist application. So I sold all of the stock I got through my previous employers stock share plan (it was good timing) and bought as much PRED as I could. In the next couple of weeks we had figures like Orrin Hatch (the 90's vitamin/supplement sellout featured on John Oliver's Dr. OZ episode, oh and I guess he used to be a senator) and some asshole from Pfizer joining the board of directors.\n\nThe stock then rose to $6.80 and put me in the range of being able to pay off my damn student loans, but I ignored the SP smashing into the upper bollinger band and figured the fundamentals would carry it off to the $10-$15 range... so I was adding to my position the whole time.\n\nBut naaaw... it retraced back to $1.53 and now it's hanging around $2.00.\n\nI also had about $500 left over from student grants in college that I YOLO'd around when I first started trading during the 2013 legal marijuana stock spree. I lost half of that learning what subpenny share selling scams were, and then I threw the other half at a random 0.0001 company (LIGA) that actually turned into real company that's gotten its greasy fingers into a few different industries including a 60 acre real estate development in kentucky. They're hanging out at about 0.0050 right now (having retraced from 0.014- I was too retarded to sell then as well). So I used about half of those proceeds to fund my secondary purchases of PRED. I guess I'm just waiting for moonrise now so I can forget to fucking sell and profit again.", "created_utc": 1565907142, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cqwwlg/am_i_autistic_enough_for_this_sub/", "is_self": true}
