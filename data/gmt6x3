{"id": "gmt6x3", "title": "HUYA, cheap little DD.", "selftext": "So when I first started looking into HUYA I thought \"fuckin chinese knock off pump and dump crap\" but as I started to peruse around my own life and hobbies outside degenerate options gambling I started to realize something. So here is my cheap little case for huya.\n\nI am a dota 2 player and die hard dota 2 e-sports fan.  Recent complaint in dota community has been that TI (largest e sports tournament in the world) has been delayed. However all other tournaments have been a go, and they are all being livestreamed and co-ordinated by companies like HUYA. Now more than ever these events need proper streaming co-ordination since they are no longer playing to a live audience. \n\nAnother big talk in the dota 2 and e-sports scene in general is the recent banning of team newbie (former TI competitive team and one member who was a former world champion) due to match fixing. (Purposfully losing etc) this is paid for by people who are placing bets on E sports. With regular sports shut down and casinos closed or limiting acess e-sports gambling has taken off. But how do you watch the e-sport you bet on if you cant just tune in on your local TV? Live streaming apps. \n\nHuya is up big but honestly I think it has more room to go before earnings. \n\nTldr: e-sports gambling, match fixing, and lack of live sports mean game streaming is at an all time high.
