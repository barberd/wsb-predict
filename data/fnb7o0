This post is not to replace them, but to basically bring the conclusions to one place, so that all the other retards like me can try and make sense of it. All of these post authors are clearly much more intelligent than me, so if I made an error anywhere in here, please let me know, and I will fix. To my fellow autists just trying to hang onto some coattails and make a buck - good luck.\n\nAll credit goes to these fine people, may they bask in tendies forever and ever, amen.\n\nThis post pulls from:\n\nu/Variation-Separate and [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmhz1p/the\\_great\\_unwinding\\_why\\_wsb\\_will\\_keep\\_losing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmhz1p/the_great_unwinding_why_wsb_will_keep_losing/)\n\nu/bigd0g111 and [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmshcv/when\\_market\\_bounce\\_inevitably\\_comesdont\\_scream/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmshcv/when_market_bounce_inevitably_comesdont_scream/)\n\nu/scarvesandsuspenders and [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmzu51/incoming\\_bounce\\_vix\\_puts/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmzu51/incoming_bounce_vix_puts/)\n\nu/the_asker_man and [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fn8l0z/a\\_market\\_liquidity\\_theory\\_of\\_the\\_current/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fn8l0z/a_market_liquidity_theory_of_the_current/)\n\nu/humanasfck and [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmieud/same\\_width\\_scale\\_sp\\_500\\_comparison\\_to\\_previous/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmieud/same_width_scale_sp_500_comparison_to_previous/)\n\ntl;dr market r fukd, buy puts.\n\nThe first point, so obvious even an idiot like me can get it, is the belief that SPY is going to keep dropping.\n\nThe Great Unwinding, predicts that SPY will drop to 217-213. After this, there will be a technical rally, built on top of  bailouts/relief/etc. up to 250-270. Following this rally,  there will be a second significant drop down to 180-157.\n\nAlong with this is discussion regarding the value of the dollar and that for the short term, dollar will be king until inflation or whatever gets out of hand. Likewise, with the rally there will be significant IV crush, meaning straight calls will have less return even if you\u2019re right (from When Market Bounce... post).\n\nThis  discussion suggests to hedge against IV crush, if one decides to try and  time the market and catch that upward swing with calls, to purchase VIX  puts with the SPY calls. The trick of this to make the IV neutral is to find options where the SPYc Vega is opposite that of VIXp delta. His example is Vega 0.24 and then delta  -0.24. So if pursuing this you\u2019ll have to read a lot of chains to match them. The downside to this is if the market continues down or you expire before the bounce, or whatever, you are double fucked. Another downside to VIX is that it trades like a euro and can\u2019t be exercised before expiry so doesnt experience as much movement overall and may be harder to fill.\n\nSo. Along with all of this, there were a few other recommendations.\n\nUUP  calls - this tracks the dollar. While we expect the dollar to be strong in the short term, you would want to be nimble and exit quickly.  UUP tends to trend along with DXY/$DX. If $DX is hitting 105-107, that is likely when you want to be exiting the UUP position, again according to the Great Unwinding author.\n\nFurthermore, when the dollar reverses, whether due to fed action or what have you, gold will likely finely take off. Look to GLD and maybe JNG calls. Could enter these positions whenever, best during a low swing, with late summer/fall expirations.\n\nIn regards to timeline. This is the extremely tricky part. The drop has happened very quickly, so it\u2019s possible that the bounce and second fall can happen quickly again. It\u2019s also possible that fed action may try to slow down the second fall. Obviously if we could all time the market the rest would be easy, but the point is while I\u2019m sure the numbers are possible, and the bounce and fall before we start the real road to recovery are true, the timeline may fuck everything for us autists.\n\nSo, couple scenarios could play out:\n\n1 - SPY hits 217-213 and rebounds to 240-270, before subsequently falling to 180-157. This is the Great Unwinding thesis.\n\n2 - SPY keeps on falling well past 217, bounces at some point, and falls to even deeper lows, but who knows how far up and when.\n\n3 - Aliens invade and this is all irrelevant.\n\nThe first thesis seems to believe that the rebound could happen as soon as this week or next, could sustain for about a week, and then fall -  unsure how quickly, could be weeks or months.\n\nThe second thesis seems to rely more on the real-world domino of corona on the market, and while doesn\u2019t  inherently disagree with the premise of thesis 1, believes that in the next 1-2 weeks the corona and unemployment numbers,  quarantines, etc will hit the market like a sledgehammer and we\u2019re gonna keep on dropping until the bailouts/relief kicks the bounce off. By that point we will have dropped to 200-180, and the second drop will have us in 150-100.\n\nPersonally, I think there might be a bit of a combo.\n\nWe may  have a technical bump at 217-213 but it will not be sustained and won\u2019t  reach the highs predicted. And we will continue to drill. There may be a  much more sustained bounce, which if it happens  I don\u2019t know at what value it will happen or what we might go too. I do think that on the second large fall we might go quite deep, as the number of afflicted hits the hundreds of thousands if not millions,  unemployment doesn\u2019t drop, etc. As for proof to support this, I am an idiot, have none, and don't trust a random guy on the internet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo long and short what the fuck do we do.\n\nI have  4/17 200p and 150p. These will likely need to be sold within the next week or two. If we cross below 200 before April I will definitely sell them. I may sell as early as tomorrow but I think we have further to drop before the bounce, so I\u2019m willing to let them run a bit. With this, one could lock in their profit early,  and then double down for further out puts (during the bounce so you get your money\u2019s worth).\n\nPersonally,  I\u2019m dubious about trying to time the bounce and how high it might go.  If you wanted to dip your toes into this, you could buy lower OTM calls (230-245ish) between 2  week and 2 month expiry. I\u2019m sure at some  point in there they\u2019ll be ITM. However, with this you would need to combine it with the VIXp to combat IV crush, which complicates things.\n\nIMO - sit out trying to time the bounce with calls. Save the cash and be ready for when the bounce does  happen, buy more puts, deeper OTM, and further out. When the bounce happens I would start buying puts anytime after we hit 240. Additionally, look at VXX calls at this time.\n\nSo to wrap this stupid thing up, here are possible strike/dates:\n\n\\-SPYc 240-270 2wk-2mos out\n\n\u2014\u2014tied with VIXp. Find an opposing Vega/delta within same expiration time frame\n\n\\-UUPc \\~1-3mos out, in the $28-30 strike range\n\n\\-SPYp 220-200 now-may (exit early! when the bounce happens you may be bear trapped)\n\n\\-SPYp 200-150 May-aug\n\n\\-SPYp 150-100 sep-nov\n\n\\-VXXc 60-80 1-2mos after we bounce\n\n\\-GLD/JNG I need to look at this more, but far out expiry calls. Fall or 2021. Anyone with knowledge here please chime in. Both for when to get in (I think I saw when it drops to 1300-1000) and what strike/date. My buddy also suggested considering long silver and GDXJ.\n\n\\-Real estate. The further down the rabbit hole we go, this will be a safe haven for longer term, buy actual real estate or REITs to catch the market rebound, and be prepared to hold for YEARS.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd as someone who works in healthcare, it is blindingly clear that \"we\" are not doing enough and are truly fucked. I'll get on my personal soapbox here to say you need to take this virus seriously, this isn't the flu. It is not ONLY an old person disease. Even if you only catch a mild case, you are likely to spread it, and are putting at others at significant risk. Wash your hands, self-quarantine, and start stocking up gradually for the second drop which may really fuck this country over. Yes, this is not an extinction level event, this country will survive, but a LOT of people are going to die, when it could have been avoided.\n\nIn before \"Sir this is a Wendys/McDonalds\" and \"Just don't dance.\"", "created_utc": 1584925987.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fnb7o0/dd_of_a_dd_putting_this_weekend_together/", "is_self": true}
