{"id": "fr9cnr", "title": "Can Hawai\u2019i Survive?", "selftext": "After a couple of weeks of trying to determine who will be hit hardest by the beer flu, I now feel that Hawai\u2019i is beyond fucked.\n\nHaving been to Hawai\u2019i numerous times, I cannot imagine how Hawai\u2019i recovers.  There are virtually no flights going to Hawaii, Hawaiian Airlines is all but grounded, 80-90% of their economy is tourism related, hotels are <10% occupancy, the overwhelming majority of their restaurants cater to tourists, their stadium parking lots are is a graveyard for rental cars that nobody is renting, and estimate the number of \u201cessential businesses\u201d on the islands to be in the single digits.  \n\nI believe this, in many ways, is welcoming to the locals.  Tourists for years have continued to desecrate the islands, and with the ongoing battle regarding Mauna Kea, for many, less people coming to Hawai\u2019i, the better.  Unfortunately, I estimate people in Hawai\u2019i live paycheck to paycheck more than anywhere else in America.  With tourism at a standstill for the foreseeable future, and an economy that will take years for them to recover, the number of pregnancies, addictions, and homeless will skyrocket. Also set to skyrocket will be the number of defaults on credit cards, loans, and mortgages.\n\nTL:DR- Hawai\u2019i is shut down and in all likelihood fucked beyond repair.\n\nBOH- $35P 9/11/20\n\nEdit- From people I\u2019m talking to on the islands, and seeing on social media, they\u2019re taking the lockdown/ social distancing about as serious as my wife took our wedding vows, who\u2019s currently out with her boyfriend.", "created_utc": 1585502137.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fr9cnr/can_hawaii_survive/", "is_self": true}
