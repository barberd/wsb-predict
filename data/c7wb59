{"id": "c7wb59", "title": "I bet on the weather and you can too!", "selftext": "**Coffee** [is up 15%](https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/KCU19/interactive-chart) or so over the last two weeks. I can go into a long description as to what's currently happening in the physical market in context the CFTC reported non industry giant short position or talk about ICE (not that ice) warehouse stocks or currency  or government owned exports imposing mandatory minimum prices but I don't think anyone here would bother to read it.\n\n  \nSo what would you understand?   \n\n\nWeather. When it's cold, shit freezes. When shit freezes, crops get fucked. In brazil right now there is chance shit is going to Freeze this upcoming week/weekend which will put coffee on the moon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ClimaTempo](https://www.climatempo.com.br/) uses a combination of both the US and European weather modelling techniques and is more reliable then other sources i have used.  Right now  The temperatures for  Minas Gerais (Alfenas, Cabo Verde, Tres pontas, Guaxupe)  are in the 2/3 degree  range, (Celsius you dumb fucks) for July 6th and July 7th...slightly up from predictions this weekend.  \n\n\n**TL/DL Buy coffee futures. If you can't, Buy JO**. If you only want to bet on cold, buy  near by expiring options on JO even though they are hilariously low volume. Do this because 1) it might be cold in Brazil and 2) Coffee is 'due' for a bounce back.   \n\n\n[Disclosure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOwtDeESXaU)", "created_utc": 1562002075, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c7wb59/i_bet_on_the_weather_and_you_can_too/", "is_self": true}
