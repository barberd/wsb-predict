There\u2019s a reason you are all fucked and it\u2019s the same fucking reason as 2008\n\nSPY is not made up of 100% shit stocks.  It\u2019s not going to 180 because SPY isn\u2019t just Airline and cruise stocks, there\u2019s 500 fucking stocks in there that\u2019s why it\u2019s called SP 500.  So for the shit cruise stocks out there, there\u2019s a fucking AMZN that\u2019s gonna thrive in this environment to counter the shit stock in the index\n\nAnd you know what they do? They kick out the shit performers and replace them with winners in the index to make spy go back to moon.  That\u2019s how it fucking worked in 2008 and it\u2019s gonna be same now.  \n\nIndexes only go up once the rebalance their shit and put only winners in\n\nEdit: i went through 2008 recession and I saw exactly what they did so fuck you all.  Motherfuckers will figure out the winners and then rebalance the SPY to go up and it will fucking work and you guys are fucking fucked\n\nEdit 2: \ud83c\udf08 \ud83d\udc3b: REeEeEe yoUr reTArDeD *gay bear opens robinhood to -90% 200p 4/17*", "created_utc": 1585587580.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frujme/forgot_about_one_simple_thing/", "is_self": true}
