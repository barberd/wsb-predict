{"id": "f6rlkd", "title": "So I actually went to a trading course and what I heard was unbelievable", "selftext": "In my city there's a big bank that offers trading courses with the idea that you will know what you're doing when you open a trading account with them. So far so good, as what I've been learning is mainly from shitposts on the internet and fundamentals in investor books have not been of much help making quick tendies which is just how I like them - what I do is pretty much the opposite as I'm getting richer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I sign up, start going, guy talking is professional but still you can tell he's not dead inside, pretty cool. He's talking about doing analysis, volatility, figures and so on. He's always repeating himself saying how important risk management is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe shows a graph tracking his first 10 months of trading when he started some years ago, he turned 2k into 180k.... and then to 1k in 2 trades. Of course I start laughing a little bit, thinking yeah well that's life, other people in the course are very concerned, they seem to be r/inv\\*sting kind of people. He says to never put more than 10% of your portfolio into 1 thing and not allow yourself to lose more than 2% in a trade. Emphasizes that we need to follow the current trend as it's likely to keep going but never go overboard and blah blah\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo later at one point he's once again saying how important it is to keep in mind some boring real numbers, people ask him about currency trading and he's explaining the boring figures. I ask him what he thinks of $TSLA, he stops for a moment and says that this is just some hype and not sustainable. Then another guy on the course asks how we should trade during the China virus, guy says basically that we should be extra careful. He implies Trump tweets have an important role in market movements. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen he says that if you're having any emotions while trading, you're doing it wrong. I feel personally attacked as trading has become a big source of entertainment, despair and anger, often all at the same time. Ask him how he's trading during a market that's at an all time high. He says he has sold all his positions rn because it's not sustainable and shit will hit the fan any moment now even though he admits it probably won't happen before the end of summer. Ask him why he's not making tendies until then, he says it's beyond his personal risk tolerance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what I learned is that I'm doing trading totally technically wrong but still making more tendies than this professional guy is. Turns out we are smarter even though perhaps more retarded than professional traders. Buy all the dips and market can't go down, stonks only go up. If you read this far you should know MSFT is boring, what the hell is that slow rise pffft, going 90% of portfolio in SPCE. Make money while you can and good luck bulls", "created_utc": 1582197165, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6rlkd/so_i_actually_went_to_a_trading_course_and_what_i/", "is_self": true}
