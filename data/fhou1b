Call or Put: Decide if you think the stock price will go up or down. If you think up = buy a call. Down = buy a put a) call - When you buy a call option (call) you are betting the stock will go up in price in the future and thus buying the OPTION (not the obligation) to buy a stock at a certain price (strike price; more on that below) b) put - when you buy a put option (put) you are betting the stock will go down in price in the future.\n\nCovered calls= trader has or buys the underlying stock that he then writes (sells) call options for the same (or less) number of shares that the trader bought or has Naked calls = trader doesn\u2019t have the underlying stock or asset that you are writing (selling) the option for\n\nCovered puts = trader \u2018shorts\u2019 (sell a stock at higher price before buying back the stock at lower price; only works if the price of the stock drops) the stock and then writes (sells a put) Naked puts = trader writes (sells) a put option without having sufficient funds in their account to cover the purchase if the option is exercised\n\n2. Strike price: the price at which the option will be exercised. OTM = out of the money. For calls (call option) this is any price above the strike price. For puts (put option) this is any price below the strike price. ITM = in the money. For calls, this is any price below the strike price. For puts, this is any price above the strike price.\n\n3. Time to Expiration: Options have expiration dates and can be thought of as insurance. You pay a premium for this insurance and that \u201cinsurance\u201d has an expiration date. You must choose a timeframe by which your option will have reached (or exceeded) the strike price. The further out the date is, the more you have to pay for that option. E.g. an option with 90 days to expiration may cost $1000 while an option with 30 days to expiration may only cost $300. Some brokerages automatically exercise the option if it expires ITM.\n\nImportant note:  European Options vs US options  \n\\- You can sell European options to others early, you just can\u2019t exercise them before the expiration date. \n\n* which is why you see people on Robinhood (A discount brokerage in US) with these massive unrealized gains (or losses) in extremely short time frames (dailies or weeklies)  \n\n\nEDIT: I have updated to correct misinformation.
