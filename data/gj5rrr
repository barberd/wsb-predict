I clapped their cheeks today for a >10-bagger on 5/15 $63p's I bought yesterday. Now let's clap 'em some more.\n\nBefore we start, if you're new to the TQQQ clappening plays, read these threads first, otherwise this isn't going to make sense to you: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7im7t/bear_porn_205736_in_2_days/) [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f8s1tc/tqqq_is_going_bust/) [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9au7j/tqqguh/) [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffsa0j/tqqq_blacked_monday_update/)\n\n\n\nAlright, so here's the deal. Starting from late March, the boys over at Proshares started holding Treasury Bills in TQQQ. Your first thought may be \"That's smart, making a little bit of interest on their cash\", right? WRONG, because they're holding 0.000% coupons. So then, why the fuck are they buying these t-bills instead of just holding cash? Well, here it is:\n\n\n\nAs of 5/12/20:\n\nItem|Value|Value x3\n:--|:--|:--\nStock|5,255,716,719|\nNet Other Assets / Cash|1,599,325,097|\nT-bills|499,813,598|\nStock + cash|6,855,041,816|20,565,125,449\nStock + cash + t-bills|7,354,855,414|22,064,566,243\nSwaps|11,797,617,452|\nNQM0 Futures|312,744,720|\nLeveraged Exposure|12,110,362,172|\nTotal Exposure|17,366,078,891|\n\n\n\nSo, their total collateral x3 appears to be $20,565,125,449 (or $22,064,566,243 if you include the t-bills), but their total exposure is only $17,366,078,891. Why the difference? If you're a smart cookie, at this point you're thinking \"Well they're probably repoing their T-bills for cash, so you should substract the value of the T-bills from the cash amount\". Ok then:\n\n\n\nItem|Value|Value x3\n:--|:--|:--\nStock + cash - T-bill|6,355,228,218|19,065,684,655\n\n\nHmm, still not right, there's a big difference between $19,065,684,655 and $17,366,078,891.\n\n\nHere's the catch. Fuckers are counting the value of the T-bills AND the repo cash in \"Net Other Assets / Cash\". Cuz fuck you, that's why we call it \"other assets\". So really, it's \n\n\nItem|Value|Value x3\n:--|:--|:--\nStock + cash - 2x T-bill|5,855,414,620|17,566,243,861\n\n\n\nIf you want to confirm that total exposure should be around 3x stock+cash you can just do the math on any older version of the holdings (check web archive). Eg as of 3/12/20\n \n\nItem|Value|Value x3\n:--|:--|:--\nStock + cash|$3,196,625,917|$9,589,877,753\nTotal Exposure|$9,602,961,802|\n\n\n\nSo why fudge the numbers? Probably because the Proshares intern that told them about these threads. They didn't like the army of wsb autists shorting their ass into the ground last time, and they think we're all retarded. Well fuck you, Proshares retards. \n\n\n\nTLDR Do your own DD, but it's time for $TQQQ puts again, ideally 2-3 weeks out, strikes $30-45.
