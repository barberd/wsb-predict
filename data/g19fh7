{"id": "g19fh7", "title": "Thank You Wallstreetbets! **Warning to Gamestop Shorts**", "selftext": "So, I posted in wallstreetbets months ago warning about how dangerous it is shorting Gamestop (especially at all time lows), but I got banned and thumbed down to oblivion...all the while, I saw countless bear posts going through.\n\nSeems like I got unbanned now (thank you mods)\n\nOnce again, if you're short GME, think twice -\n\nExtreme negative sentiment based on silly arguments (like 'omg they didn't give their employees hand sanitizer', 'who buys physical?', 'omg they're closing stores' ) has been moving this down for months.  \n\nFuture looking news (not priced in yet), there's still -\n\n\\- An undisclosed record date for the proxy fight (which means more institutional share recalls) \n\n\\- New consoles incoming for the holidays (confirmed) \n\n\\- Gamer activity globally at unprecedented levels \n\n\\- Debt payoff/refinancing news and possibly more sharebuybacks \n\n\\- Former Nintendo exec Reggie Fils-Aime comes on board April 20th \n\n\\- Activist investors have been gobbling up shares recently (Burry, Hestia, Donald Foss, Must Asset Management)   \n\nHistorically, the stock runs for multiple months before the new console cycle begins. This time is going to be extra explosive due to the extreme sentiment and short interest. I wouldn't think about shorting this until years from now IF they don't successfully pivot.\n\nIf you're a perma-bear, at least use puts given the nature of the unlimited risk with shorting.\n\nDisclosure: Long GME", "created_utc": 1586883994.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g19fh7/thank_you_wallstreetbets_warning_to_gamestop/", "is_self": true}
