{"id": "crapv0", "title": "Possible 10,000% moon on AM", "selftext": "Picture from Mindhunter season 2 - obviously a producer on the show has inside info and wanted this sub to notice.\n\nAntero Midstream trades around 7.50, possible 10,000% return if it goes to 750.\n\nIt could also be a little more in-depth than that. The show takes place at the time around 1980, and there was no AM stock at that point, but there were 4 stocks in the S&amp;P with AM in them - AMAT, AMD, AME, and AMGN - all of which have outperformed the S&amp;P to date except AMD. Maybe this is a good investment strategy for the future if someone wanted to invest in all the current AM stocks today as the equal basket here heavily outperformed the S&amp;P.\n\nAlso, WSB AM-750 is a radio station in Atlanta, which is where the show partly takes place. I doubt it has to do with that, but hey, you do you. Besides, if you're not trying to take a risk, why are you here? \n\nhttps://m.imgur.com/a/M375Xaf", "created_utc": 1565981452, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/crapv0/possible_10000_moon_on_am/", "is_self": true}
