{"id": "gk0sb3", "title": "$INO Bullish Trends?", "selftext": "Introduction:\n\nInovio is in human trials for a Covid-19 vaccine with safety results expected in late June. A catalyst for another surge may come from optimistic headlines. We may see another rally if they receive funding. $NVAX just received $388 million and $MRNA was cut a 1/2 billion dollar check. Being another competitor in the human trial stage of development, further funding for $INO is on the horizon.\n\nBrief Technical Analysis:\n\n[$INO Projection](https://preview.redd.it/kahwvmsc2uy41.png?width=1390&format=png&auto=webp&s=8979b9b652bcb437349656d898c1347bea58e957)\n\nIf we observe closely, we can see that there is a pennant pattern forming. It is replicating the previous consolidation (Jan 21-Feb 21) that lead to a bullish break-out on Mar 20.\n\nDespite the conceptual resemblance, other indicators of another breakout:\n\n\\- Decreasing concurrent sell volume\n\n\\- Increasing concurrent buy volume\n\n\\- Higher lows as seen on the lower resistance of the pennant pattern\n\nUltimately, as we consolidate against the upper and lower bounds, we're looking for a break of $14.30 with higher and increasing volume. If so, TA checks out for bullish case. Also, fundamentals check out for bullish case. I could see this stock easily surpassing $30 in another bull rally soon.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Are you invested in $INO? I found the best concurrent contracts for bulls: I looked at the Greeks, and I found the optimal ratios between Delta and Theta if you still want to get in: \n\n7/17 $18c\n\n7/17 $21c\n\nNote: these trades might take time to fill because they are low-volume", "created_utc": 1589510106.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gk0sb3/ino_bullish_trends/", "is_self": true}
