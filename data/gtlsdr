{"id": "gtlsdr", "title": "The Option Spread whose TIME HAS COME", "selftext": "Edit:  For some reason if I post this as a DD it won't post.  So I guess its a discussion\n\nMost of you retards only buy or sell single contracts, and that\u2019s fine, but I am here to give you another way that is perfect for times like these.\n\nLet me introduce you to the ratio spread.\n\nThis is when you buy/sell an ATM option, and then buy/sell 2 (or more) OTM options.\n\nFor example:\n\nSPCE Short 1x Oct 2020 15 call Long 2x Oct 2020 25 calls\n\nThe spread looks like this: https://www.danielstrading.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/futures-options-strategies_call-ratio-backspread_960x680.png\n\nThese are also called the rich man's butterfly, or the poor man\u2019s straddle, or the gentleman\u2019s yolo, the main difference being that one side is open to unlimited gains/loss and one side is capped.\n\nWhy is this spread perfect for right now?\n\nFirst, it wins if a stock moves hard in either direction, similar to a long straddle. Unlike a long straddle, it doesn\u2019t cost you your whole account balance, and its max loss comes from theta decay in the \u201cbelly.\u201d We can easily exit the spread before theta really starts to kick in and own us.\n\nSecond, you can angle the spread to take advantage of your bias, but collect theta if you are wrong. For example, I am bullish GLD, but I recognize it is a crowded trade and could come down from here for awhile. A short call ratio spread that makes money if GLD rockets higher, or dribbles lower, is a nice trade.\n\nThird it bets on an increase in volatility. Volatility has been coming down now for months in many assets, and while it could continue to come down, the biggest chunks out of volatility have already been eaten. Plus we can shape the trade so that if volatility does continue to come down, at least we will collect theta as it does on the capped part of the spread.\n\nI am going to use SPCE as an example because I think the stock is perfect for this kind of play.\n\nIf you go back and look at SPCE history, the stock tends to do one of two things. Either rocketship to the moon, or dribble down as a slow bleed. In its long history, it has only had a few rocket ships, and in all likelihood, the calls you are buying at any time to take advantage of the next run up are going to expire worthless as they slowly bleed out after the most recent bull trap.\n\nWe are going to get around this with a short ratio spread. A long ratio spread is more popular with market makers and is an easy way to collect Theta as the stock chops around. It looks a lot like a butterfly on a payout graph with one side slopping down into the hell of unlimited losses.\n\nA short ratio spread is the opposite, with a belly in the middle of losses, almost like a long straddle, and one side sloping into the heaven of unlimited gains.\n\nNow, using the example above (buy 2x 20 calls and sell 1x 15 call in SPCE) you can see what the setup looks like:\n\n\u2022If the stock stays under 15, the two long calls at 25 will expire worthless and we will collect the premium from the 15 call\u2026as of right now, that is around 15-30 cents (per spread) of theta gang action.\n\n\u2022If the stock roars higher to 40, the two long calls we bought at 25 will print and the short call at 15 will be a loss, but not as large of a gain as the two long calls.\n\n\u2022The worst case scenario is the stock goes to 25 at expiration where our two 25 calls expire worthless, and we owe 10 bucks on the short 15 call. However if it goes to 25 fast, the spread will be a winner as time will not have killed the long options yet.\n\nYou can mess with the strikes to change this around. As you bring the two strikes closer together, the belly of losses gets smaller, the upside gets better, but it costs more. As you move the strikes apart, often the spread gets cheaper, the unlimited upside gets \u201cfarther away,\u201d and the belly gets deeper. It is up to you how you want to structure it. Usually the more bullish I am the closer I have the spread, the more neutral the more credit I want to collect\n\nManagement:\n\n-We are not holding this spread to expiration. We are getting out of it 30-40 days before it pops off. Reason being that the risk in this trade is the belly which is all theta decay. Most of the theta decay is in the last 30-40 days of an option spread, where it decays faster than a meth head\u2019s teeth.\n\nI picked October expiration in the above example. So around early September, this spread is coming off. By then a few scenarios will have played out. If the stock has fallen below 15, I will make or lose a small amount\u2026whatever the cost was of putting on the trade. If the stock has rocketed higher to 40, I am a happy camper and will make $500-$1k for each spread. If the stock has chopped around in the high teens, low 20s, I lost a couple hundred bucks.\n\nThe reason I like this trade is it plays on SPCE unique action\u2026either rocketing higher or dribbling lower. If SPCE goes lower from here, which I think more likely, I am fine having this spread on as it drops to between 8-12. If it rockets higher, I am also happy. If it does something unexpected and goes up a point or two per month for the next few months\u2026well I lose on the spread but it isn\u2019t the end of the world.\n\nThe point is, I could do this spread every 3-4 months and probably get small losses/wins until it finally breaks out higher and I can cash in. I don\u2019t win as much as buying straight calls, but my losses are smaller and I can easily roll the spread until/if it happens. Buying straight calls is only a better play if I get in right before a run higher\u2026and I suck at timing.\n\nVolatility: -Our long ratio spread is LONG volatility/positive VEGA. This is so important please listen because if you get volatility wrong, you will get crushed. A ratio spread is for a stock that has currently low relative volatility, like SPCE.\n\nGo here: https://marketchameleon.com/Overview/SPCE/IV/\n\nCheck IV and see if it is under the yearly historical volatility average. Check to see if it is below 30 day Historical volatility. You will have to make the final call on whether volatility is low enough to put on the spread. Personally, I want SPCE\u2019s IV to dip below 100 before I put this spread on. THE IV IS OFTEN MORE IMPORTANT THEN THE EXACT PRICE when placing this spread.\n\n-If at any time in the next few months we get a spike in SPCE IV, our spread does very well. If IV goes down, our spread will suffer (the two long options will get hit hard and the short option will not).\n\n-You don\u2019t want to do short ratio spreads when Vol is high. Some of you might think this is a great spread to try on stocks before earnings! Big move guaranteed! You would be wrong. It is like buying a straddle before earnings. IV crush inc\n\n-It is important to know how the stock is correlated to volatility so we can play it correctly. For SPCE, as the stock goes higher, volatility goes higher. So you want to use OTM calls in your ratio spread. For SPY, volatility goes higher as the stock market goes lower\u2026so you want to use OTM puts in your ratio spread.\n\nIt is easy to mess this volatility component up and treat this spread as just a directional play. It is also a volatility play.\n\nFor example, dumb dumb thinks Gold is a good candidate for rocketing higher with inflation or crashing lower with deflation. He thinks the crash is more likely so he shorts a put ratio. He thinks he is so smart because if it continues higher, he will collect a premium, and if it crashes quickly, he will make bank on his long puts. What is wrong with this picture? Gold is positively correlated with volatility! As it goes higher, volatility goes up and this only marginally helps the spread, if at all. As it goes down, IV comes down and sucks the life out of any profit he would have had with his long puts. Don\u2019t be dumb dumb\n\nLastly on stock selection for this spread. If you have an option platform like ToS or Tastytrade, it is easy to mess around with this spread and get a feel for what moving the strikes does. I recommend using a price chart to SEE what kind of move a stock will have to make to cause the \u201cunlimited profits\u201d part of this spread to print. It is often farther away than you think\u2026which is why this spread rules on volatile instruments (like SPCE), which are currently low volatility. This spread sucks on boring shit like TRV and CAT.\n\nTLDR:\n\n-Ratio spread is good for stocks you expect to move a lot, but you are not clear on the timing and wish to avoid the theta decay of outright options.\n\n-Short Ratio Spread example: Short 1x Oct 2020 15 call Long 2x Oct 2020 25 calls\n\n-Long volatility. Look for stocks that are currently low volatility but may have increased volatility over the next few months\u2026as in the entire market right now\n\n-Take spread off 30-40 days before expiration to avoid theta risk. You can always roll it if you still believe\n\n-In above example, If SPCE has a big move by Septemberish we win. If it goes up a lot, we win, if SPCE goes down, we small win/loss depending on the price of initial spread\n\n-If SPCE chops around 16-30, spread loses, but may still win if volatility rises at any point.\n\n-Personally, I would wait for IV to go below 100 for the SPCE short ratio.\n\n-Other good candidates to look into: SPY short Put ratio (wait for a low volatility day, probably next week). GLD short call ratio. Bad candidates are low volatility stocks in general.", "created_utc": 1590872578.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gtlsdr/the_option_spread_whose_time_has_come/", "is_self": true}
