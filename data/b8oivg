Just put in your ticker and you get the same info with a summary of buy, sell, or neutral.\n\nI use bar chart as a guide to where the supports, resistance, and SMAs are.\n\nRemember that these are just tools and not to be used as crutches or sure things. Don't bet more than what you're willing to lose. Or do it, I'm not your mother.\n\n [https://www.barchart.com/etfs-funds/quotes/SPY/technical-analysis](https://www.barchart.com/etfs-funds/quotes/SPY/technical-analysis) \n\n [https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/AMEX-SPY/technicals/](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/AMEX-SPY/technicals/) ", "created_utc": 1554237207, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b8oivg/ta_tools/", "is_self": true}
