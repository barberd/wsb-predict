There are numerous reasons to buy puts on GME.\n\nAnalysts have been adjusting earnings down since the end of January. This morning Zacks made another adjustment to $1.59/share which would be a decline of 21.3% YOY from GME's $2.02/share same Q last year:\n\nhttps://www.baseballdailydigest.com/news/2019/03/18/zacks-analysts-anticipate-gamestop-corp-gme-to-post-1-59-earnings-per-share.html (MarketWatch)\n\n***\n\nRevolting investors, possible changes to leadership soon:\n\nhttps://www.thestreet.com/investing/gamestop-investors-threaten-proxy-fight-14896292?puc=tsczacks&amp;cm_ven=tsczacks\n\n***\n\nNews broke over the weekend that Snapchat is rumored to launch its own gaming service as soon as next month:\n\nhttps://www.engadget.com/2019/03/15/snapchat-gaming-service-rumor/\n\n***\n\nApple is also now rumored to launch its own subscription gaming service. It may or may not be part of the Apple event March 25th, but considering that the teaser for the event is \"It's show time\" and the event will focus on entertainment content -- it's not a bad time to announce it, even if it's not launched on March 25th:\n\nhttps://9to5mac.com/2019/01/28/apple-reportedly-plans-netflix-for-games-subscription-service/\n\nhttps://appleinsider.com/articles/19/02/02/apples-rumored-gaming-subscription-could-be-a-big-change-for-mobile-gaming\n\n***\n\nGameStop's bread and butter (about 50% of its tendies) revolves around used game sales. Well -- Xbox is also strongly rumored to be coming out with a disc-less Xbox One as early as May. It even has a name. This one isn't so much as if but as to when:\n\nhttps://www.windowscentral.com/xbox-maverick\n\nGME and physical games have been dying a slow death for a long time, but all of the above, combined with GME's abysmal earnings report being released in about a week (March 27th), combined with the fact that GME has a loooong way to go before the holiday season (majority of $$$ comes November - December), the stock is goin' down over the next several days/weeks/months.\n\nOr up.  Either up or down I guess.  I guess it could go up, especially over the next several days... but don't be deterred. As more information leaks on the services above and the reality of an earnings report that shows a YOY decline of 15-22% (?) sinks in... it'll be a blood bath heading into April. \n\nBuy puts that last through the next few weeks/months or at the very least March 29th if you like gambling.", "created_utc": 1552920035, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b2jhzk/why_im_buying_puts_on_gme_gamestop/", "is_self": true}
