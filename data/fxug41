Don\u2019t be greedy at the moment. The market is at a cross point and this might be where we begin heading down again. I want to make sure that many of you understand what the market is showing. Let\u2019s start with futures, they currently all of the forward futures are pointing to lower values and the June 2021 future is even down at 2650 at the moment. This shows where the expected market movement is towards.\n\nI\u2019m posting this as risk management advice where I believe many of you can gain. When looking at your portfolios you can either get out and 1 of two things will happen:\n1) you keep the profits up until now and the market tops meaning you can get back in at a later date and make even more.\n2) the market continues higher although it will slow down and you will miss out on only a bit of gains but you can always get in again.\n\nManage your risk as well as you can and think about what is best for your portfolio!\n\nIn r/wallstreetbets terms - gay bears suit up!", "created_utc": 1586446218.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxug41/psa_rinvesting_took_down_my_post_even_though_it/", "is_self": true}
