Even if there\u2019s the next leg down, consider that your timing would need to be impeccable. \n\nSo instead, consider the following strategies:\nWrite put credits on aapl and msft a month out, with vxx call debits that are due to expire at the same date. The otm vxx call debits would serve as a perfect hedge in case aapl and msft fall. I specifically chose these two tickers because I like both companies, but you can also pick other tech leaders such as fb etc. Basically, do it with a variety of tech stocks that are leading the market. Alternatively, you can just go with qqq put credits hedged with vxx call debits if you only wanna thing about two tickers. \n\nWrite iron condors on GLD and SLV: this is understated. For instance, between each opex period (historically), SLV on average moves between around 0.7 dollars. That means if you write a condor on SLV on May 18 for June 19 that is 2 point wide from the current price, you\u2019ll have an incredibly likely chance that this trade will go through with you realizing the full profit. \nAs for GLD, write biweekly condors 5 point wide from current price and those typically have an incredible chance of success, especially if you write it in the middle of two opex dates (may 1 for may 15 was when I wrote GLD 166/164, 155.5/153.5). The theta burn on GLD options is best in a two week period. \n\nAnd finally, another strategy for a hedge is place OTM call debits on TLT for each opex that you write the put credits on. This would be similar to the strategy with vxx. Both sets of strats are perfect, but I personally like vxx more since TLT is prone to mass liquidation events like the one we saw in March.\n\nSo basically, stop thinking that you\u2019ll be able to time the market with ur retarded technical analysis or looking at volumes on puts. A lot of put volume is just 1-2% of a fund\u2019s money for a multibillion dollar long. The 50 cent trader (ruffer capital) put those trades on to protect their net long assets, which included companies such as Disney. In the end, they just broke even since the vxx options provided a cushion for all the loss in their equities. Most people who consistently make money do it without having to predict market direction.", "created_utc": 1589154005.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghcbe4/trading_strats_that_yield_consistent_profits/", "is_self": true}
