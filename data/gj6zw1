{"id": "gj6zw1", "title": "In defense of creativity", "selftext": "CRITICISM OF THE WSB VOTE SYSTEM\n\nThe voting system is the best system we\u2019ve had so far but it is flawed. It allows for a minority to take down a post while failing to consider how many upvotes it has. If a post has say 20 upvotes in 20 minutes, 2 people who dislike the post can come in and take it down entirely. In this system 2 autists is greater than 20 autists. People can appeal the vote but they are unlikely to do so since the post is already out of sight.\n\nOne could say I am writing this whole post because,\u201dReeeeee the WSB vote system took down my posts!\u201d I would cede that my posts were taken down rightfully. The spam argument is a solid argument. But it was through the taking down of my posts that I noticed this flaw. I fear that future posts could be removed by a minority. \n\nPOSSIBLE SOLUTIONS\n \n\u2022The vote bot should go away if a post has reached a certain threshold of upvotes. \n\n\u2022The vote bot should have a disapprove AND approve option.\n\n\u2022I will reduce my spam\n\nLately there has been a growing number of people taking issue with my memes. Hence why I worry that a small minority could remove my posts in the future. I take a collage of images, and put it through a filter. Depending on the image I may do more than that, but that\u2019s the basic formula. I have never claimed to have painted my images and I\u2019ve been completely open about this.\n\nHere are the main criticisms I\u2019ve noticed, please let me know if I\u2019m mistaken:\n\n\u2022My posts are low effort and generic\n\n\u2022My posts are spam\n\n\u2022My posts are self promotion \n\nMY POSTS ARE LOW EFFORT AND GENERIC\n\nI wish I knew how to bold text on reddit then I could be like those cool DD posts. Yes, some of my posts are easy and made quickly. However, for others I spend hours making them. Overall, I autistically dedicate a majority of my time to making memes. The time it takes and the way a meme is made is ultimately insignificant, what matters is the end result. 99% of memes on WSB are low effort collages, some of the best memes are just pictures with text added to them. My point being, low effort does not translate to low quality and vice versa. \n\nAs for my memes being generic, I would say that if it gets upvotes rather than downvotes that\u2019s not the case. For the most part WSB has good eye for memes and only upvotes good memes. Here\u2019s a comment that I think sums things up well and I feel this applies to all memes on WSB not just my content:\n\n\u201cYou are documenting the saga of wsb through your illustrations, telling a story for the ages... conquest, victory, despair, defeat, comradery, gayness... someone from the outside would have no idea... but as an insider... the nuances... this is art man. This is the best sub on this whole piece of shit site and the haters don't even understand what they are hating.\u201d\n\nMY POSTS ARE SPAM\n\nI\u2019ve been doing about 1 post a day for over a month. As a result, I went from 500 karma to 150k in that same time period. I honestly can\u2019t argue with that, I pretty much am spamming the sub and I will tone it down. This is a completely legitimate criticism. \n\nMY POSTS ARE SELF PROMOTION\n\nPlease go read the WSB rules on self promotion. I\u2019ve checked multiple times and I am following them to the T. I talked with a mod about this a while back and they told me I was fine. I do not want to be violating any rules and if this is the case please let me know!", "created_utc": 1589401575.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gj6zw1/in_defense_of_creativity/", "is_self": true}
