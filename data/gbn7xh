Remember when Cartman from South Park owned a theme park and wouldnt let anybody go? when DIS opens its parks that first quarter will be like going to a hannah montana concert in 08 so many people are going to be buying tickets. \u2018I cant wait to go spend my money at DIS\u2019 is all my girl has been saying. Not to mentntion + was just gaining serious steam for them before all this lockdown shit rattled the markets. Universals recent Trolls is being streamed for $20 a pop across the world rn and doing numbers that are making theartres look unecessary. The film industry will never die, and disney is god in this arena. hell, if we go to war with china maybe they will even make twice as many movies.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/crosjxD4XaI", "created_utc": 1588356727.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gbn7xh/half_off_dis_limited_time/", "is_self": true}
