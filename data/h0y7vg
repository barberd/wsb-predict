The bigger pump means we can expect the pullbacks to get bigger too. So why is it that all of the sudden Jun 8-Jun 11: 5% drop is scaring everyone. Yea its a big pullback but its nothing we haven't seen yet. Spy will recover from it in less than a week and the printer will continue (like jpow literally said yesterday on TV). \n\n\ud83d\udc8e\u270b\ud83c\udffb\n\nSPY 400C", "created_utc": 1591877871.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h0y7vg/a_little_reminder_for_those_panicking_rn/", "is_self": true}
