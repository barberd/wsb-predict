There are 151 million total shares outstanding, of which, \\~73 million are owned by Bain Capital and Blackstone, two very sophisticated PE firms that have been involved with the company since they took it private in 2006.\n2. Backing out those 73 million shares leaves a free float of 78 million.\n3. Of this free float, \\~35 million shares are short, which leaves 33 million available in the market (this equates to \\~$157 million\u00a0in equity value).\n4. This $157 million of \"free float\" compares to a remaining buyback authorization of $294 million as of Q3 2019.\n5. In other words, the company's remaining buyback plan is greater than the free float of all the shares in the market. This aggressive buying will likely cause shares to move higher, resulting in short covering, which will then send shares skyrocketing. \n\n**EPS guidance for 2019 is $2.10, or &gt;$300 million...this means the company can use less than one year of earnings to repurchase every share available in the market (remember the free float is only 33 million shares, or $157 million).\u00a0 In less than two years, at the current price of $4.77, MIK can buy out all of the public holders except for Bain/Blackstone. Even if earnings decline massively, the company can still buy out every public shareholder in 2 years time.** \n\nFwiw the company repurchased\u00a0$105 million worth of stock in the last 9 months, of which $80 million occurred in Q3 2019. **Over the last three years MIK has repurchased $457 million, $254 million, and $405 million worth of shares so clearly this thesis has the ability to play out.**  \n\n**As an example of what can happen. in December 2019 (2 months ago) the company announced they were hiring a former Walmart executive to be their new CEO and the stock went up &gt;30% in a single day.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# In terms of the company itself...you might think it's a boomer retailer that's going to be killed by Amazon...but there are many reasons why that likely won't happen anytime soon. \n\n# \n\n* The average item price is only $3-4 and the average transaction is $22 (customers buy 5-7 items per visit). MIK has 60% private label penetration.\u00a0Both of these facts makes it hard for customers to price compare online or shop for similar items on Amazon.  \n* The typical customer is not price-sensitive for $20 of items that they need the night before a science project is due or the Christmas party happens.  It's possible to get these items online but you typically pay more because you have to buy in bulk.\n* Piper Jaffray has published survey data that shows for items priced &lt;$15, Amazon prices are actually 25% **higher** than MIK. And given the average item price purchased at MIK is $3-4, the company is fairly insulated from Amazon competition.\n* MIK is the largest arts and crafts retailer in North America and is a non-mall destination based retailer with strong seasonal assortments that drive traffic.\n* The Arts &amp; Crafts Industry grows with household formation and displays very low correlation with the broader economy (crafting purchases are less-discretionary than most retail).\u00a0During the last recession (2008-2009), A&amp;C industry sales fell -15% (2008) and -1% (2009) and MIK sales were -5% (2008) and +0% (2009) \n\n**With the stock at $4.73, the shares trade at a little over 2x...time to load up!**", "created_utc": 1581613097, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3cxie/buy_mik_because_its_the_most_polished_turd_in_the/", "is_self": true}
