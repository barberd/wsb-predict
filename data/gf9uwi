{"id": "gf9uwi", "title": "ShmobinMood Margin Policy", "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI'm looking for a fellow autist with experience in ShmobinMood shenanigans, particularly depositing money you don't have to get a boost in margin on the instant deposit to make a play.\n\nI was deep in a set of covered calls that were going south in a big way, and I couldn't afford to buy myself out of them and save my shares, so I decided to implement this trick to get myself out of the calls. Now ShmobinMood comes a knockin and says I need replace the refunds reversed... OR ELSE. What is this or else? They mention other actions, up to and including account termination if I don't deposit the money in 3 days time. Which is totally fine... The company I'm holding has their ER today and I'm going to exit either tomorrow or Monday. Do I have anything to worry about? Is ShmobinMood actually entitled to the fake margin I used? Do I really \"owe\" anything? The gain in shares covered the cost of the play, so I really just need the fake margin to push things through.\n\nHelp me out here fellas. Am I fuked in some way?", "created_utc": 1588869112.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gf9uwi/shmobinmood_margin_policy/", "is_self": true}
