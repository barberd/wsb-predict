Phase 3 clinical trial is on the way with phase 2 showing good results aswell.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3.\n\n**Remesetemcel-L**, treatment of acute Graft Versus Host Disease (aGVHD) following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. \\*Initiated rolling Biologics License Application (BLA)  recently and commercialisation in the US would be around next year, they would be starting this out with their first sales team. This treatment has been licensed for Japan to a partner, revenue growth in Japan more on this below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n**If this company holds a promising future, why is it at a beat down price?** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's not making substantial money yet, and it burns an average 20 million per quarter. This would significantly drop down as it approaches an end-line to their R&amp;D activities, and also commercialisation.\n\nIts only source of income right now is through royalties of licensing their patents outside of the US :-\n\n[http://investorsmedia.mesoblast.com/static-files/dc128e20-0415-4028-bf17-ace5ebda9c4f](http://investorsmedia.mesoblast.com/static-files/dc128e20-0415-4028-bf17-ace5ebda9c4f) \n\nTheir aGVHD licensed partner in Japan is doing well in terms of sales, but royalty from that is a small slice of the cake.\n\nCurrently they do have access to borrowing facilities to keep operation going, payback with interest starts around 2021.\n\nIt is small company to compared with most biotech companies, and is actively looking for a partnership with larger conglomerates for No.1 and No.2 as above.\n\nPreviously their leading pipeline; chronic congestive heart failure investigation was funded by a legacy company, which was later acquired by TEVA. TEVA decided to end the funding leading to the the low and flat value since 2016.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**So, how to YOLO on this?**\n\nrealistically, you won't make x10 in 3 months. But what it gives, is a company filled with quality pipelines, board members of well-versed in the biotech industry ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph\\_R.\\_Swedish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_R._Swedish) ) and proper safety nets that this company would not fail anytime soon.\n\nCurrently, I believe it will be *at least* double the current ticker price in a year timeframe. This is where I put my entire savings in and I can sleep soundly. I would probably be buying OTM options on this at the end of this year.", "created_utc": 1565416131, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/coe8a0/dd_meso_mesoblast_a_concise_dd_on_a_biotech/", "is_self": true}
