We're talking about an option expiring tomorrow, literally the FDist of FDs\n\n**TL,DR; read the damn title you retard**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere it is ladies and gents, the holy grail of UOA, textbook insider trading\n\n**COMPANY**\n\nDFS, or Discover Financial Services, has no earnings and no foreseeable catalysts in the near future. We know that they're considered a predatory lender, and we know that many Americans are unable to pay off their debts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**OPTION ACTION**\n\nToday, the algo detected an institution methodically buying puts on DFS, specifically the 43P with expiration tomorrow. Big block trades ranging from 500-1500 split into three lots spread across three exchanges. These purchases happened throughout the day, much like BA and GILD two weeks ago, in an effort to conceal their purchases. A number of smaller sells also preceded, but the latest purchases were large buying to orders. Volume is over 9000 and OI was at 30 yesterday.\n\nThe stock didn't move enough today for this to be an algorithmic momentum trade, this was methodical and calculated.\n\nOne concern is large amount of sweep sells, all occurring at the same time with large deviations in size. The worst case scenario for us is if this is an algo bait and switch for people following the UOA strategy. As of right now though, I'm cautiously optimistic that this trade will work out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs of right now I'm still monitoring the order flow to see if the institution is going to bait and switch us and sell at the last moment. I will update at 12:55 PST on whether or not this has happened or not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**HBI EXPLANATIOIN**\n\nSome of you may be suspect after my admittedly premature HBI DD. I apologize for any losses incurred on that trade. However, I have seen some significant differences between this and HBI.\n\nFirst of all, HBI was a huge block bet, very obvious to see. DFS is a little more sneaky, all these blocks are disguised and mixed with smaller sell orders. They're traded on different exchanges, at different times, much like BA and GILD. This institution doesn't want people to know that it's trading DFS. That's what makes this trade so compelling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: 12:39: Institution has just doubled down with 800 more puts\n\n12:43: Instution bought 1800 more\n\n&#x200B;\n\n12:55: institutions have now well over 2 million in exposure on this, no selling", "created_utc": 1588274921.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gb2fj5/dfs_51_43p_insider_trading/", "is_self": true}
