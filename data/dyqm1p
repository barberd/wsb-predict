Seeing that AMD was having a good run, I decided to do the most logical thing and inverse it to buy puts, but then I remembered someone said in this forum to always \"inverse yourself\" so I decided against the puts and tried to load up on call options at the $41 strike, I was intending on buying four but it was a dollar above what I wanted to pay for, and I said I'll just do a day trade on $SPY in the meantime. Well I got in SPY for a $313 strike call contract and it s*** the bed especially with Trump and his comment on China. Even worse AMD decided to tie rockets on it's shoes and skyrocketed damn near to $42. So now I'm down $100 because I didn't want to pay $1 extra for a damn AMD contract. \n\nCongratulations, I think I've just become an autistic degenerate", "created_utc": 1574196857, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dyqm1p/death_to_amdeath_spyguy/", "is_self": true}
