We can talk about vaccines all we want, but they're at minimum 12 months away. This will be the first therapy that has RCT data backing it up.\n\nWe will see a pump by Donnie touting the success of big, beautiful, American pharma baby Gilead. I mention this in a comment below, but GILD has been constantly overlooked because the naysayers claim this won't be a big profit generator for them. The truth is: **it doesn't fucking matter**. Look at all these other companies that won't have the same levels of revenue for years to come. It's not about the bottom line anymore, but hype and time in the limelight.\n\nPositions: [GILD 6/19 85c](https://i.imgur.com/I5CJ5ht.jpg). 6/19 to leave enough room for the US remdesivir results.\n\nEdit: closed at 76 today, AH now at 85. Is GILD mooning the entire market? Dunno.\n\nEdit2: for those that missed this, I would honestly buy puts on GILD, maybe 85p. GILD always, always, always, has a tendency to slide down soon after good news. IMO it's more likely to go back down to around 80 than it is to continue to climb to 90-100.", "created_utc": 1587070733.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2ni8s/gilds_remdesivir_will_be_successful_according_to/", "is_self": true}
