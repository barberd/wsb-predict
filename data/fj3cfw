Im also willing to make bets on the validity of these hypothesis' if yall present reasonable ones.\n\nIf the U.S. as a whole sees case growth of double in a single day (likely in the next week), then the markets are going to slide down more than we've seen so far. Double circuit breaker type shit, as it becomes clear that we're many weeks out from peak.\n\nIf major cities' case growth rapidly outpace the rest of the country (very likely in the next few days), than limited lockdowns will be put in effect, and we will see the first wave of domestic travel ban as an attempt to isolate further outbreak spreading.\n\nIf the markets continue to bear down for 5 days straight (moderately likely as it stands now), then we're in a full blown recession, and the DOW will go sub 20000 in a flash, SPY to below 200, etc. Nothing will recover until Q4 at best.\n\nIf Trump declares a domestic travel ban, with or without any of the above happening (somewhat likely given current state), expect Airlines to plummet more than 15%, and people to go full out panic. Retail will slide down heavily as they will cut serious hours to be able to keep shelves somewhat stocked. \n\nAnymore questions about other possibilities I will add on as edits.", "created_utc": 1584287521.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fj3cfw/researched_ifthenbecause_post/", "is_self": true}
