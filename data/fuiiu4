Long DGX LULU NKE ONEM", "selftext": "Coronavirus has confronted every Karen, Tom, and They/Them with their own mortality, something to never cross their minds in the last decade while the economy expanded so rapidly, and money flowed so freely, that they could focus on inane shit like their identities and personal brands.\n\n\"The healthy man has a thousand wishes, the unhealthy man has only one.\"\n\nGo outside and everybody's walking, jogging, doing burpees in the park. \n\nCoronavirus will change America in countless ways. One way is certain: in the coming years there will be a huge focus on safeguarding and improving one's personal health and fitness.\n\nSo how to invest in this trend? \n\nFirst off, wait for the drop. S&P500 is gonna tank hard in the coming months. Then go long / get LEAPS on:\n\n1. Long Quest Diagnostics, DGX. Blood monitoring and regular testing is already something the affluent do in coastal cities; once people stop worrying about money, they begin to obsess over personal health. That's why all these mofos walk around like they're perpetually on their way to the gym. Which brings us to next guy:\n\n2. Long Lululemon, LULU. Getting lean and healthy, and walking around with a big, muscular ass popping out of $160 yoga pants is going to be even more of a status symbol for girls than it already is. \n\n3. Long Nike, NKE and Adidas\n\n4. Long ONEM. Boutique medical practices will expand.\n\nTLDR: Long DGX, LULU, NKE, ONEM but only after SPY tanks \n\nAny other ideas out there post dat shit, let's get this paper\n\nEDIT: \nDid not know WSB transitioned from smart people acting stupid, to stupid people acting stupid. Some atrocious reading comprehension here. Where the fuck did all these actual morons come from?", "created_utc": 1585954859.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fuiiu4/longterm_dd_in_the_next_35_years_there_will_be_a/", "is_self": true}
