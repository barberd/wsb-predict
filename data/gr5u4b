In a nutshell, DT Ignite assists carriers  to monetize phones that they sell, by selling ads within them. Now what  the fuck does that mean exactly? Assume you are a mobile operator or an OEM (original equipment manufacturer). Now, through the use of APPS, you  can control and monetize the actual mobile devices through the use of  various apps and other ads within it. So basically, the phone  manufacturer, or operator, can install random ass apps that you probably  do not want or will use in your phone.

However, But  it's important to actually see where the money comes from in this case,  and which part of the DT Ignite model, which in this case is the Dynamic  Installs.
