And I came across QuesTrade. It was exactly what I was looking for. Terrible web interface, terrible customer service. I hit the lottery! Or so I thought. I went to create a QuesTrade account, when a message popped up on my screen\n\n\u201cAttention [N Word] the official position of QuesTrade, is that we hate all [N Words Hard R this time] and we at QuesTrade, think that Black People, should go back to being able to be traded as slaves. Also, we directly fund Private Prisons, and kidnap black people off the street, just to put them in there. Kids, Adults, Old people, we don\u2019t even give a shit. We just don\u2019t like black people. Also Norwegians, they\u2019re even worse. We fucking hate Norway. Fucking Bucketheads\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know what a Buckethead is, but it feels like a Norwegian slur.\n\nNow guys, I think that because of this racist and abhorrent behavior, we should ALL cancel our QuesTrade accounts. Comment below if you\u2019re going to cancel yours.\n\nEDIT: QT support just messaged me and told me that they were the one who made my Ex girlfriend leave me after calling me her future husband and telling me she had NO DOUBTS about our relationship! This caused me to make an attempt on my life yesterday morning. This means that QUESTRADE IS DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR AN ATTEMPTED SUICIDE. I WILL BE OPENING A LAWSUIT IMMEDIATELY!!!\n\nEDIT 2: Questrade ALSO seems to have committed a series of Cultural Genocides in the former country of Burma, now Myanmar. The reasoning is unknown but it seems Questrade is directly involved in financing OR COMMITTING GENOCIDE.\n\nEDIT 3: SPY 4/17 150P", "created_utc": 1585891532.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fu2h02/questrade_called_me_the_n_word_do_not_use/", "is_self": true}
