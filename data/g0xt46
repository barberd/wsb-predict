{"id": "g0xt46", "title": "Have we bottomed out?", "selftext": "I just don't see the market being at the end of the crash. The damage to our economy is very severe. The fear is real. I don't think the market has adsorbed it all yet. I don't know when, but I really think the market is going to roll over and not only retest the lows, but go lower. On the ES, I think the true bottom is gonna be around 1680 to 1660. Historical bear market crashes show that if this crash follows pattern, there will be another leg down. \n\n17 million unemployed and rising. Retirement accounts are next to get hit. I think the government will step in and ease or remove penalties on early withdraw so the people unemployed can have access to their funds. Once that happens the NASDAQ will be hit and be hit hard. For now the NASDAQ hasn't been hurt very bad. AAPL, AMZN, MSFT are examples of what are in every retirement portfolio.\n\nSeveral state unemployment programs on the verge of collapse. Mortgage defaults, both commercial and residential, over the next 6 months and further out is going to be horrendous. Remember the last crash was because of mortgage defaults. Of course the earnings can't be good and the list goes on and on.\n\nIn times past I didn't concern myself with other crappy world economies. This time it is different because of how dependent we are on their supply chain. That has been stomped on.\n\nI don't mean to be all gloom and doom, but the FED can't fix this no matter how hard they try. Right now all the talking heads and the big banks are saying we have bottomed out and it is over and are shouting from the mountain tops and TV sets saying we are free at last.\n\nTotal capitulation has not happened yet. It will though, unfortunately.", "created_utc": 1586834226.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0xt46/have_we_bottomed_out/", "is_self": true}
