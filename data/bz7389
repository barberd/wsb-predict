{"id": "bz7389", "title": "Bought a BYND patty to see what is the hype about", "selftext": " I went to buy me a beyond meat patty to see what is all the hype about. it was on sale for $6 in kroger. First it smells nothing like meat. when you are cooking it, it has a distinct hint of beef smell. taste test wise, it is nothing mind blowing, or tasty. It can be eaten though. not disgusting or anything, just like eating vegetable patty made of beans. cant really explain the taste. maybe taste a little like pea, bean sprouts? smell the cardboard and that is what it almost smell like. for the price of $6 the size of the patty is not big enough, therefore tastewise,pricewise, the stock price or the hype is not justified. they had only 1 left in that kroger. they do have other products in the frozen section, like pasta, taco.. I dont know why this stock is so high \n\nAlso, I am paid by BYND tendies to tryout their product\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/mk3xvi996n331.jpg\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/no5hw6a96n331.jpg\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/vswoxya96n331.jpg\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/ex448f996n331.jpg\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/6sl0du996n331.jpg", "created_utc": 1560221644, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bz7389/bought_a_bynd_patty_to_see_what_is_the_hype_about/", "is_self": true}
