{"id": "bucxc4", "title": "AMD expectations.", "selftext": "First of all, these are my gains from my option play today. This is my separate account dedicated to crypto and options now. I had AMD $30 calls expiring this week, bought them under $0.07 and sold them into close for a nice little profit.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/BSC0RW3](https://imgur.com/a/BSC0RW3)\n\nI have been buying and selling AMD shares for almost three years now. In hindsight, I would have probably retired by now, had I not wasted tens of thousands of dollars trying to play other stocks and just held all my money in AMD, but that's a story for some other time.\n\nThe reason I sold into close today was\n\n1. I was worried about theta decay.\n2. It has been my observation, that every time AMD makes the top gainers list, it drops the very next day.\n3. I didn't want to repeat the poor history of not taking profits when I have 100%+ gains and then lose it just because I got greedy for more.\n\nI might be wrong in selling, but it was almost 400% gain on my options, so I think most people will forgive me for not holding.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf it helps anyone, my observation is that whenever AMD makes the top gainers list, one should sell because it drops the next day. Inverse is also true, whenever it makes the top losers list, one should buy because it bounces back a little next day. Perhaps this is true for other stocks too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: I am stilling holding my $60 options expiring in January 2020. I get some grief about that, but I think with the transformation AMD went through over the years, it is now ready more than ever to deliver, and we will see some major price movement by the end of third quarter. This isn't as far fetched as some people may think, NVIDIA has done incredible moves in a year not too long ago. I think it's AMD turn to do so this year.\n\nPlease take it with a grain of salt, observing a stock for almost three years, one is bound to get a little attached and perhaps a tad too optimistic.", "created_utc": 1559125661, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bucxc4/amd_expectations/", "is_self": true}
