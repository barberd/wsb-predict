{"id": "f6zt9p", "title": "Thank you!!!", "selftext": "Long time lurker, first time poster. For the longest, all I saw was TSLA and SPCE and AMD and BYND options being shared. Today for the first time with LL and DBX I was able to actually get involved and pursue some of your recommendations. I wanted to try autism out months ago but I didn't have the 100's or 1000's of dollars required to purchase call options on the meme stock of the week. Mostly because I WAS attached to my money and quite frankly some of the things recommended seemed so farfetched. When I saw tesla round the corner at 800 and moving towards 900 I thought maybe these guys are good autistic and not bad autistic. Today I bought calls for 01/2021 on LL and it cost me 3 dollars to get into the position and I closed for a profit of 80 dollars. (not a lot I know but goddamnit did my pp swell when I realized I had just contracted the autism). Thank you for finally sharing some call options that don't require 200-500 dollars to purchase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: no recommendations on options here but thank you to the autists who led me to growing a pair and hopping into something and allowing me to make a small amount of money. Now who do I speak to about yoloing my $80 profit? lol", "created_utc": 1582233032, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6zt9p/thank_you/", "is_self": true}
