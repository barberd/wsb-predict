As a money badger, no bull can gore him, no bear can maul him. Mr. Wolverienstein is Triple-A rated: Acoustic, Alcoholic, Adderal prescription, so listen up. \n\n\nThis WSJ article really rattled my stink pouch. \n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/dealerships-give-car-buyers-some-advice-just-stop-paying-your-loan-11581762601\n\nNo paywall:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/f4j3wh/wsj_dealerships_give_car_buyers_advice_just_stop/\n\n\nMost, if not all of you, are complete idiots, who have not participated in an entire market cycle and think that ANY correction is a sign of the coming apocalypse.
