WSB resident autist starts with $4K cash + 4K margin\n2. purchases $8K stocks\n3. Sells deep ITM calls for, say, $6K cash immediately\n4. RH monkeys gives autist an additional $6K in margins\n5. autist now has $12K in buying power, plus $8K in stocks; total assets now $20K\n6. autist repeats step 2, but with $12K instead of $8K\n\nAutist multiplies buying power by 1.5x each iteration. On the 2nd iteration, he will have $18K in buying power, plus the $20K he already has in assets, meaning he will have $38K in assets. 3rd iteration = $65K, and so on. At this rate he will reach over $1 million in assets on the 11th iteration, and over $1 BILLION in assets on the 28th iteration. \n\nThe best part is that Mr. autist can buy ANY stock, and thus has a basically unlimited ITM call buyers market to tap into. Whole stock market is worth like $25 trillion right now. ITM calls market probably worth at least $100 billion. \n\nOK but that's not actually the best part. The best part is that this strategy CANNOT GO TITS UP. Let me tell yo why. \n\nThe secret is step 3. Calls are sold at a premium, even FD options due this friday. It's a small premium, around 0.1% for medium risk stocks, but it is a premium. If the autist sells every call at 0.1% premium, that's $1000 on $1M, or ONE MILLION DOLLARS on $1B, PER WEEK. \n\nBut why can't it go tits up? Because that 0.1% premium is as good as locked in. When you sell ITM calls you protect yourself from losses. Deep ITM calls almost always get exercised, because the risk of any stock going down 75% in 1 week is very very low. At the end of the week, those FD options get exercised, Mr. autist receives the strike price. The strike price and and the premium which Mr. autist already nets him 0.1% returns. \n\nThe final part of the equation is, do these gains outpace RH's margin interest rate? The answer is YES, barely at 0.1% returns per week. RH margin interest is 5%/year. 0.1% returns per week gets you 5.33% returns in a year with 52 weeks. That means about 94% of Mr. autist's gains are skimmed off by RH. But if he leveraged $1B, that's still around $60,000 per week, or around $1.2M per year.", "created_utc": 1573069696, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dslgjx/rh_infinite_leverage_literally_cant_go_tits_up/", "is_self": true}
