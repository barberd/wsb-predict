Although RH was great for getting me into things, I simply don\u2019t trust this silicon valley business that well. \n\nI\u2019m thinking about transferring to thinkorswim. However, do these transfers include options too? RH website only denotes stocks. And how long do these transfers take to complete? Idk if I\u2019d want some of my calls to sit in limbo while I wait on the transfer. Should I close em out before I make the switch?\n\nGive me some advice on this you tards.", "created_utc": 1576608354, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ebzy8w/anyone_here_transferred_stocksoptions_from_rh_to/", "is_self": true}
