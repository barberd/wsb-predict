I really appreciate the kind words, especially with respect to the various videos I made. Unfortunately, something happened to my YouTube account. Let me lay out the details, and perhaps someone here works at Google or YouTube, or knows someone who does, who can help. This is a bit verbose, but my experience in matters like this is that it pays to be too detailed. \n\n I use a certain gmail as my 'main email'. I also have a dozen email addresses associated with various companies I've been involved in. For some reason I started making YouTube videos with one of those email addresses, not my main email. Before I could realize it, I figured, well, that'll just be my YouTube account and I'll never lose access to that email, right!?\n\n One joke about Hillary Clinton's reptilian DNA requiring careful procurement and examination to determine the Alex Jones-style truth of the matter, and I found myself in what could only be described as 'sleepaway camp for thugs'. The corporate email I used ended up dying due to nonpayment. Banks like to cancel their relationships with me abruptly, and the folks I put in charge of maintaining this kind of thing didn't do so great of a job. So that email attached to the YouTube with thousands of videos, millions of views, died. Then the channel died. I am 99% sure the channel is not in trouble for any violation of policy. I just think when the email is unresponsive (and YouTube is constantly sending you all kinds of spam garbage), YouTube closes your account. \n\n I have access to the email in question once again. Attempting to login to YouTube with said email is not permitted since its not a gmail. This begs the question of how I used to do it before. Well, I had GSuite. So, my team signed up for GSuite again. Signing into YouTube takes a 30 day \"seasoning period\" (I have no other way to put that... probationary period?) before you can access YouTube. That should be up in a few weeks. I'm not holding my breath that all the videos will be there when we log back in.\n\n As many of you know, YouTube does not have a customer support function. Everything is done to make it as hard as possible for the customer to get help. So Question 1: is there an alternative channel for YouTube customer support that we're unaware of? Question 2: Does anyone have a 'plug'--either an employee at YT/GOOG or someone who knows a human being there that is willing to take 15 minutes to figure out what happened and help. \n\n For me, YouTube videos were a way to show anyone who was interested a window into the 'real' me. The mainstream media concoction, which I enjoyed creating, was a fun ruse but also a self-propagating and hard to control monster. Thankfully, the authentic Shkreli was live on YouTube for all to see. Most people who saw videos of me came away with a favorable impression. Without those videos, the NBC narrative prevails. Thanks for your thoughts and attention on this matter. As a gift, I leave you with the thought that I would avoid being long any coronavirus-related securities as they universally appear to be overvalued to this observer.
