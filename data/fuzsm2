{"id": "fuzsm2", "title": "Trading Debit Spreads: FAQ From My Last Post.", "selftext": "So a lot of you guys saw [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ftzllw/you_dont_need_to_play_otm_puts_to_double_your/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) post and convinced yourselves to buy put spreads either last Friday or next week.  As funny as it would be to see you guys somehow fuck it up, here are some helpful things to know and some FAQ so I can sleep better knowing I convinced hundreds of people to make a trade.\n\n1. Do you need cash collateral for selling the put?  No, the collateral against potential losses is just your long position on the higher strike put. \n2. How do I leave the position?  The position will show up in your account as (SPY $260 / $250 Puts 4/15 Exp X Debit Spreads).  You will be able to sell this just like you would any other option at any point throughout the trading day, just be careful of wide bid-ask spreads and know what you're selling for.\n3. What happens if I get exercised?  First of all, this cannot happen if your short leg is still out of the money.  If that leg is in the money, it is very unlikely you will get exercised unless it is the last couple hours of the expiration trading day (people don't have much of an incentive to exercise early).  BUT, in the situation that you do get exercised, you will not be fucked.  You will also be holding put contracts at a higher strike than your short leg, so if you get exercised, RH should just exercise your long leg automatically and this would exit your position completely.  If you still want to be in the position, you may simply just re-open another one. \n4. What happens if I trade a put debit spread very deep in the money or very far out of the money?  Lets say you trade a SPY 290 / 280 spread (the 290 is long, 280 short), one week out.  That is a 10 dollar spread, so if SPY closes below 280, you will have near 10 dollars.  That trade, since it is so likely to succeed, would likely cost around 9.80 or 9.90 dollars (so you would be almost guaranteed to make barely anything, but a rogue wave in a trading day could completely fuck your portfolio).  Also, with such small profit margins, you could lose a lot of that profit on just the bid/ask prices fucking you over.  Conversely, spreads further out of the money will be much cheaper, but if successful can return several hundred percent.  If you are confident spy will hit 220 in a week, you could open a 225 / 220 spread and it would pay a lot more than the 260 / 250 trade.\n5. Do you have to hold till expiration to get the max value?  Yes, technically you do, and I don't recommend doing this.  You really won't be selling these spreads for max value because as long as there is time left in the trading day, there is at least a tiny chance that your puts will go out of the money in a crazy EOD rally.  Because of this, I'd recommend selling for 90-98% of the maximum value whenever that occurs.  At that point, there isn't much left to gain from the trade anyway.  \n6. How do I make the trade?  Sigh... Search > Spy > Trade Options > Select Date > Select (Top right, you need spreads enabled) > Buy a 260 Sell a 250 > Continue > Review.  But if I need to explain that to you, maybe you should do a bit more research on spreads and how they work.\n7. Should I trade X Date and X / X Strikes for a spread?  I don't fucking know.  Your max value is the long strike minus the short strike times 100.  (260-250 = 10 \\* 100 = 1000 max value).  If you are paying 5 cents for the chance to make 500 dollars, then that shit is most definitely going to expire worthless.  The lower your profit potential, the higher chance you succeed.  I don't know what the fuck the market is going to do tomorrow or next week (but great recession 2 is totally here).  \n8. Does IV Crush and Theta help me or hurt me?  It depends.  If your entire spread is out of the money, these will still fuck you over.  If you are in the money, then consider yourself a part of theta gang because you want nothing more than for the underlying asset to not move a a fucking inch forever.  The trade I described benefits from IV Crush and Theta Decay at the current SPY value.  If SPY goes up a lot then the spread value will start being negatively affected by them.\n9. How do you get your posts approved?  They never fucking get approved.\n10. Why don't we just trade similar trades on a daily basis and make 30% returns a day?  You are still placing a bet on the market.  If you are trading daily spreads then all it takes is one fucking Trump tweet to absolutely fucking GUH your portfolio.  The trade I described still requires you to have a negative outlook on the market over the next 2 weeks.  If you are not confident in that, then do not make the trade.  I don't know how anyone can be confident in what the market is going to do in a day, I don't recommend making that type of play if you intend to full YOLO it.\n11. Can I lose everything since I will at least have the money from selling the short leg at the end?  Yes, you can lose it all.  Robinhood will actually let you invest more money than your total portfolio value (it's not leverage and it's not margin, don't worry) on the long leg AS LONG AS subtracting the value of the short leg puts you within your buying power.  Because of this, your maximum loss on the trade is 100% of what you put in.  Tread lightly.\n\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SVswX2V\\_vE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SVswX2V_vE)  Here is a great video that explains a long call spread. \n\nTL;DR Don't fuck it up. I'll feel bad.\n\nLet me know if I missed anything.", "created_utc": 1586028843.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fuzsm2/trading_debit_spreads_faq_from_my_last_post/", "is_self": true}
